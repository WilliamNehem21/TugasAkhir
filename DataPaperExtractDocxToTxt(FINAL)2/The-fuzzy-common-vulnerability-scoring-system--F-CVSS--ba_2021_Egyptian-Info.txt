Common Vulnerability Scoring System
a b s t r a c t 

This study presents a new approach for calculations within the Common Vulnerability Scoring System that scoring the effects of vulnerabilities in software on the security status. These calculations is the method that is most commonly used in scoring software vulnerabilities. The present model demonstrates how software security vulnerabilities can be calculated using linguistic terms. Therefore, the proposed method has a more flexible structure than this system. The current Common Vulnerability Scoring System formula and scores were used to assess and implement the presented model. The aim was to form a fuzzy model called the Fuzzy Common Vulnerability Scoring System based on the success probabilities which are defined using linguistic terms such as low, very low or high. Moreover, the Fuzzy Logistic Regression (FLR) method was used to define the relationship between the exact inputs and fuzzy multiple outputs, and the Least Squares Method was used to estimate the parameters of the presented model. The performance of the model was evaluated by a comparison using Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Kim and Bishu’s criterion. Validity of the fuzzy regression model is demon- strated with different fitness functions. The expectation was that more practical estimations with better error tolerance can be achieved by using linguistic terms to assess common vulnerabilities.

Introduction

Vulnerability is defined as an error or event that may directly or indirectly distort the integrity, practicality or privacy in a system, device or service. Many vulnerabilities are detected and declared every year. The administrators of organizations with the resources to terminate vulnerabilities in their systems first focus on the most critical vulnerabilities. The number of companies and systems assessing these risks is quite limited. The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), based on the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST) open platform, is a quantitative calcu- lation method transforming simple formulae into a value of the severity of vulnerabilities [1]. The availability of standard metrics allows an objective assessment to be performed to compare vul- nerabilities. Therefore, the use of CVSS is very beneficial. CVSS

has three metrics groups: basic, temporary and environmental. However, vulnerability databases are generally associated with base points. The basic score represents the characteristics that are not affected by the concepts of place, system and time, and that are present in the nature of all vulnerabilities. Base metric consists of 5 basic components. Attack Vector reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible. Attack Complexity describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Privileges Required describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability. User Interaction captures the require- ment for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the suc- cessful compromise of the vulnerable component. The Impact metrics refer to the properties of the impacted component. If a scope change has not occurred, the Impact metrics should reflect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) impact to the vulnerable component [2]. Fig. 1 indicates the basic CVSS formula. Despite the fact that CVSS is a standard metrics system, there are a couple of limitations. CVSS calculation includes subjective calcula- tions as indicated in Fig. 1. Moreover, users need to be competent in terms of both the vulnerability characteristics and the CVSS

scoring systems. Explaining vulnerability deficits through linguis- tic variables is easier than finding and calculating the basic CVSS scoring parameters [3]. This study aimed to model and estimate CVSS base scores based on a vulnerability description using Fuzzy Logistic Regression (FLR).
Regression analysis is one of the popular methods used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (output) and one – or more than one – independent variable (input/inputs). Where the meaning of certain terms may cause complication or uncertainty in real life, these terms should be defined using linguistic statements or fuzzy numbers. Linguistic variables turned into the means requir- ing the use of fuzzy sets to express verbal statements digitally. Ref.
[4] offered the fuzzy regression model where certain terms are rep- resented by fuzzy numbers Fuzzy regression is based on the theory of fuzzy sets and fuzzy probability. In published literature, it has been commonly used in two forms. The first is based on the concepts of probability suggested by Tanaka, and it reduces the total uncer- tainty of estimated values for the outputs [5–7]. In contrast, the sec- ond uses the approach of minimizing errors between the simultaneously observed outputs, which is the fuzzy Least Squares Method suggested by Diamond and Celmin š [8–11].
This study proposed the use of the FLR model along with the exact input and fuzzy output. Diamond’s FLS approach was used to esti- mate the parameters of the fuzzy logistic regression model. Section 2 includes some studies from relevant literature. Certain definitions regarding fuzzy sets and a brief explanation of the classic concept of logistic regression are included as a preamble to the suggested method in Section 3. The FLR methods are reviewed in Section 4, and the FLR model was formed using the CVSS dataset in Section 5. Criterias were compared to test the suitability of the suggested FLR model in Section 6, and the results are presented in Section 7.


Literature review

The number of studies explaining vulnerabilities through lin- guistic variables (fuzziness) is quite limited. Ref. [12] presented the fuzzy systems approach to assess the relative potential risk
of computer networks being exposed to attacks arising from vul- nerabilities. He used this approach to sort the vulnerabilities. Accordingly, the purpose was to get analysts to prioritize their studies based on the potential risk exposure of assets and net- works. To assess the vulnerability in telecommunication networks, Ref. [13] suggested an approach based on CVSS V3, expert decisions and fuzzy logic. Ref. [14] presented a holomorphic risk level esti- mation model as a conditional probability of the frequency and impact estimations regarding CVSS. Logistic regression analysis was used to model one – or more than one – independent (ex- planatory) variable(s) through a multiple response variable. FLR was used to define the relationship between exact or fuzzy inputs and fuzzy dual/multiple outputs. The number of studies where FLR is used is quite limited.
Diamond’s FLS Method and Tanaka’s probability approach were used to estimate the parameters of the FLR model used in the pre- sent study. FLR was suggested by Pourahmad et al. for dual outputs and exact inputs [15]. Ref. [4] used the concept of a probabilistic method to estimate the parameters of the model and proposed a probability approach and certain suitability criteria. FLR was sug- gested for modeling the fuzzy dual outputs. Moreover, the logarith- mic conversion of probability rates was modeled using the enlargement principle, and Diamond’s method was used to esti- mate the parameters [15]. A new technology credit scoring model based on the FLR method was proposed using fuzzy inputs and fuzzy dual outputs [16]. Exact inputs and fuzzy outputs were used by many authors from published literature for the fuzzy regression models [5,17–19]. Some of the studies where fuzzy outputs, fuzzy inputs and exact parameters were used, were reviewed by [8,10,20] Fuzzy outputs, fuzzy inputs and fuzzy parameters were examined by [11,21]. Recently, [22] propose a novel fuzzy regression method in order to predict affective quality and esti- mate fuzziness in human assessment, when objective features are given. Ref. [23] propose a systematic approach using the FLR models attached with optimized h values to identify the functional relationships in QFD, where the coefficients are assumed as symmetric triangular fuzzy numbers. Ref. [24] pro- pose a novel chaos-based fuzzy regression (FR) approach with

which fuzzy customer satisfaction models with second- and/or higher order terms, and interaction terms can be developed. Ref. [25] compare the widely used methodology of discarding some implied volatilities and interpolating the remaining knots with cubic splines, to a fuzzy regression approach which does not require an a-priori choice of implied volatilities. Ref. [26] propose a fuzzy regression method that accounts for fuzziness introduced through human judgment and the limitations of widely-used psychometric quality scales.

The underlying preliminary theory for the proposed model

This section provides a short brief on certain definitions regard- ing arithmetic operations on fuzzy sets and introduces the classic logistic regression method.

Some basic rules in fuzzy set theory

Definition 3.1.1. Consider U elements as a universal set indicated by
‘‘X”. Membership of X, a classic subset of U, is indicated through the lA
~
function and with A fuzzy sets and a regular dual set as follows:
Definition 3.1.6. Use of approximate figures by decision makers working on sensitive topics is an undesirable approach. Therefore, a subtraction should be made from the new fuzzy set achieved as a result of the operations performed with the fuzzy numbers. In other words, converting the fuzzy output set into an exact value after the operations have been performed with fuzzy figures is called purifica- tion. Purification occurs through the membership functions of fuzzy sets. In this study, purification was made using theyic = (yil +yim +yir ) equation with the Centroid method, where yim is central, yil is left devi-
ation, and yir is right deviation [27].


Ordinary logistic regression

The purpose in using logistic regression analysis is to form an acceptable model that can define the association between the dual dependent variables and one – or more than one – independent variable(s) in a way that the least number of variables is used and the best adaptation is ensured. Logistic regression is used mainly in medicine, but it is also employed in credit scoring and genetics. No assumptions regarding the distribution of the vari- ables used are present. The response variable may be dual or mul- tiple. Independent variables may be continuous, intermittent, dual
or a combination of these. There is no linear relationship between

method were used to assess the proposed method [30]. Y and Y are the real and estimated figures for the outputs, and Kim and Bishu’s assessment criteria are as follows:

smaller / value means better performance for the model.
Another criterion is that the real value was calculated using yi
while the estimated one was found using y^~ (purified exact value) for the error in sample i. The smaller values mean that the estima- tion ability of the model is better.

MAE is that the real value was calculated using yi while the esti-
mated one was found using y^~ (purified exact value) for the error in sample i. The smaller values mean that the estimation ability of the model is better.

MAE = 1 X y~^ — y

Furthermore, validity of the fuzzy regression model is demon- strated with different fitness functions. For fuzzy output data, the mean fuzzy credibility (MFC) is used.
The MFC is determined based on (51),

MFC = X 
l~y (yc (i))

(51)

i=1 
y (i) + y (i) 

When MFC is high, the model generates high memberships with respect to all yc(i) and generates small uncertainty estimates. Despite the MFC, two other fuzzy criteria, namely average fuzzy spread (AFSC) and index of confidence (IC), are used to further val- idate the effectiveness and the performance of the fuzzy regres- sions, and they are as described as following:
AFSC given in (52) indicates the overall uncertainty predicted by the model. Unnecessary uncertainty is unlikely to be predicted by the model, when AFSC is small.

AFSC =

y (i) — y (i) 
(52)

IC given in (53) evaluates the degree of variation of all collected samples to all fuzzy estimates with i = 1, 2, ··· , 2592 which are the model outputs. The IC is similar to R-square in statistical regres- sion, which indicates the capability of fitting the collected samples. When the IC is large, the fitting capability of the regression model is better [34].

Kim and Bishu’s method, MSE and MAE was compared for eight different observations in Table 4. Although the errors in Kim and Bishu’s method were not significant, Kim and Bishu’s method achieved a score of 1.7997 while MSE was 0.2809 for the ‘‘Critical” observation regarding the comparisons made for different linguis- tic thresholds. For the ‘‘Critical” observation, Kim and Bishu achieved 0.6242 while MSE gave 0.0069. Following the ‘‘Very Low” observation, Kim and Bishu achieved 1.8682 while MAE gave 1.1658. In other comparisons, MSE was substantially found to be more successful than the Kim and Bishu method and MAE. To sum up, the estimation ability of the model was found to be good as a result of the calculations made with MSE.

Table 5 shows that for MFC the results are 1.24, MFC is expected to be large here, AFS is giving 3.36, AFSC is expected to take smaller value here, IC is giving 0.64, IC is expected to get large values. The proposed model is generally feasible and it can obtain better results when the three fuzzy criteria are taken into account.

Conclusions

Probability measurements and logarithmic conversion of prob- ability rates regarding fuzzy outputs were performed to form an FLR model in this study. Evidence indicated that the classic logistic regression model may create uncertainty in the variables giving indefinite multiple categories. No assumptions regarding the explanatory variables are present in the logistic regression analy- sis. In cases with dual-response variables, Bernoulli probability dis- tribution should be followed. However, no probability distribution can be considered for indefinite observations. The insufficiency of normal logistic regression in modeling indefinite dual observa- tions, and the abundance of these observations in clinical and other studies, made this an interesting problem. The suggested model targeted the observations regarding the exact inputs and multiple fuzzy outputs. Compared to the studies on the FLR model, the sug- gested model was prepared based on the Least Squares Method formed by using Fuzzy-CVSS, which has certain advantages. For instance, the method models the relationships between the net inputs and fuzzy outputs (a linguistic term). Effective results were obtained by the proposed model when fitness functions are taken into account. Moreover, the estimated outputs are the fuzzy numbers representing the probability figures for the exam- ined event. Ref. [31,32] modeled the fuzzy relationship between the net input–net output observations based on a probabilistic approach.
Regarding the logistic regression, fuzzy and indefinite observa- tions were disregarded in establishing a model, while a relation- ship was defined between the fuzzy variables in the fuzzy logistic regression. Classic logistic regression cannot be imple- mented due to the fuzziness of CVSS severity in the suggested method. In addition, a new field was used for the first time, which is different to the logistic regression model in a fuzzy environment. However, the suggested model can be expanded in cases where both explanatory variables and response variables are fuzzy. More- over, different parameter estimation or model assessment methods can be used to improve the model. In conclusion, with the use of linguistic terms to assess the common vulnerabilities, the expecta- tion is that it will assist the administrators of organizations on a
broader scale with better error tolerance levels in taking action against the most critical vulnerabilities.
