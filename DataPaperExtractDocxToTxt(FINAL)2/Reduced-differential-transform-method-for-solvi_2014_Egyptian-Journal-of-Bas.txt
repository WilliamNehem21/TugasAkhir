differential transform method (RDTM) for solving the (1 + n) e dimensional Burgers' This paper discusses a recently developed semi-analytic technique so called the reduced equation. The method considers the use of the appropriate initial or boundary conditions
and finds the solution without any discretization, transformation, or restrictive assump- tions. Four numerical examples are provided in order to validate the efficiency and reli- ability of the method and furthermore to compare its computational effectiveness with other analytical methods available in the literature.

Introduction

Let us take the following (1 + n) e dimensional Burgers' equation
u(x1, x2, x3, ..., xn, 0)= u0(x1, x2, x3, ..., xn),	(2)
where ai, i = 1, 2, 3, ..., n, and b are constants.
Eq. (1) is used in the study of cellular automata, and
interacting particle systems. Eq. (1) describes the flow pattern

The one dimensional Burgers' equation is quite popular in wave theory, which has wide applications such as in gas dy- namics [3], plasma physics etc. Due to its broad range of ap-

higher dimension. Richard's equation (1) is a nonlinear PDE and as we know that obtaining the solutions of nonlinear PDEs are more difficult than those of linear differential equations. In
most of cases, these nonlinear PDEs do not admit analytical solutions, so these equations should be solved by using special methods. In recent years, some researchers used new tech- niques for solving these types of problems [4e8]. In the past few decades, traditional integral transform methods such as the Fourier and the Laplace transforms have commonly been used to solve engineering problems. These methods transform differential equations into algebraic equations which are easier to deal with. However, these integral transform
methods are more complex and difficult when applying to
operator. The basic definition and operation of the RDTM method is described below. The basic definitions and oper- ations of reduced differential transform are introduced below.

using Homotopy  perturbation  method (HPM),  Adomian
decomposition method (ADM) and Differential transform method (DTM). However we notice that these methods involve complex computations. In recent years, Keskin et al. intro- duced a reduced form of DTM as reduced DTM (so called RDTM) and they applied it to approximate some PDE [10] and factional PDEs [11]. More recently, Abazari and Ganji [12] extended RDTM to study the PDE with proportional delay. Futhermore, Gupta [13] used RDTM to fractional BenneyeLin equation, and Abazari and Abazari [14] applied the RDTM on generalized HirotaeSatsuma coupled KdV equation, while Srivastava et al. [15e18] used RDTM to solve the various problems arising in telecommunication systems and biological population model. The reduced differential transform recursive equations pro- duce exactly all the Poisson series coefficients of solutions, whereas the differential transform recursive equations pro- duce exactly all the Taylor series coefficients of solutions.

Reduced differential transform method

Consider a function u(x1, x2, ..., xn, t) of (n + 1) e product of (n + 1) single-variable function, i.e. variables and assume that it can be represented as a
u(x1, x2, ..., xn, t)= F1(x1)F2(x2)...Fn(xn)Fm(t). On the basis of the
properties of the one-dimensional differential transform, the
function u(x1, x2, ..., xn, t) can be represented as
From the above definition it can be seen that the concept of
the reduced differential transform is derived from the two- dimensional differential transform method.
Definition 2.2 If  u(x1, x2, .....xn, t)= R—1[Uk(x1, x2, .....xn)],  v(x1,
x2, .....xn, t)= R—1[Vk(x1, x2, .....xn)], and the convolution 5 denotes the reduced differential
transform version of multiplication, then the fundamental operations of the reduced differ- ential transform are expressed as follows:

u(x, y, 0)= u0(x, y)= x + y.	(26)

From the initial condition (26), we can write

Using Eq. (28) in Eq. (27), we obtain the following Uk values
successively
U1 = x + y, U2 = x + y, …, Un = x + y.
Then, using the differential inverse transformation, we get

Using the RDTM to Eq. (31), we get the following iteration
formula
and quite accurate mathematical tools for solving the (1 + n) e reveal that the proposed method is very effective, convenient dimensional Burgers' equation. It can be observed that the so-
lution approach of RDTM is much simpler than differential transform method (DTM) and it needs less computational effort than DTM. In other word, RDTM is an alternative approach to overcome thedemeritof complex calculation of DTM, capable of reducing the size of calculation. As a special advantage of RDTM rather than DTM, the reduced differential transform recursive equations produce exactly all the Poisson series coefficients of solutions, whereas the differential transform recursive equa- tions produce exactly all the Taylor series coefficients of solu- tions. We notice that the RDTM technique is highly accurate, rapidly converge and is very easily implementable mathemat- ical tool for the multidimensional physical problems emerging in various domains of engineering and allied sciences.
