Abstract
Chu spaces are a general framework for studying the dualities of objects and properties, points and open sets, and terms and types, under rich mathematical contexts that are relevant to several sub-disciplines of computer science and mathematics. Traditionally, the study on Chu spaces had a “non-constructive” flavor. The recent work of Droste and Zhang [4] on bifinite Chu spaces provides a basis for a constructive analysis of Chu spaces and opens the door to a more systematic investigation of such an analysis in a variety of settings. As a step in this direction, we show in this paper that a category of bifinite Chu spaces is monoidal, but not monoidal closed.
Keywords: Chu space, colimit, E-bifinite, monoidal category, non-monoidal-closedness


Introduction
In [4], Droste and Zhang introduced a special category of Chu spaces called bifinite Chu spaces. Bifinite Chu spaces can be viewed, in an intuitive category-theoretical sense, as “countable” objects which are approximable by the finite objects of the

category. Such a notion of structural approximation is captured categorically as the colimit, with the underlying morphisms being monics.
The main objectives of [4] were to characterize monics in Chu spaces, formulate and instantiate the notion of colimits, characterize finite objects in the category of Chu spaces with monics. Basic properties of bifinite Chu spaces were also investi- gated, including the existence of a universal, homogeneous object.
This paper studies the monoidal closedness properties of bifinite Chu spaces, and introduces a new notion called E-bifinite Chu spaces. These are defined in the category of extensional Chu spaces with monics, as colimits of ω-sequences of finite spaces. All bifinite Chu spaces are E-bifinite. We show that the category of E-bifinite Chu spaces is monoidal, but not monoidal closed. The key construction for a monoidal category is the tensor product. We use the standard definition of the tensor product in Chu spaces [3] and show that the category of bifinite Chu spaces with monics is not closed under tensor products, but the same tensor product induces a continuous bi-functor with respect to E-bifinite Chu spaces. Together with an appropriately defined unit, we obtain a monoidal category. A proof is given to show that this monoidal category is, however, not monoidal closed. The intuitive reason for this negative result is that the colimit construction is not symmetric with respect to objects and attributes in Chu spaces, and so linear negation (“perp” or transposition) is not a functor anymore: it can reduce an E-bifinite Chu space to a non E-bifinite one.

Chu spaces
We recall some fundamental definitions and notions directly concerned with Chu spaces, following [4].
Definition 2.1 A Chu space CΣ over a set Σ is a triple (A, r, X), where A is a set whose elements are generally considered as objects and X a set whose elements can be regarded as attributes on A. The satisfaction relation r is a function A × X → Σ which describes attributes of every object in A. A morphism from a Chu space AΣ = (A, r, X) to a Chu space BΣ = (B, s, Y ) is a pair of function ϕ = (f, g) with f : A → B and g : Y → X such that for any a ∈ A and y ∈ Y , r(a, g(y)) = s(f (a), y).
In the following, when considering a class of Chu spaces , we always assume that they are based on the same set Σ and so leave it unspecified, simply denoting CΣ by C. Following the convention of category theory, we denote the set of morphisms from the Chu space A to B as Hom(A, B). In addition, we refer to the forward connecting of a morphism ϕ = (f, g) by ϕ+ = f and the backward connnecting by ϕ− = g. For sake of convenience, we denote the object set A of C by obj(C) and the attribute set X by attr(C).
For any two morphisms ϕ : A → B and ψ : B → C, define the composition of ϕ with ψ as ϕ ◦ ψ = (ψ+ · ϕ+, ϕ− · ψ−). It can be readily checked that ϕ ◦ ψ is a morphism from A to C. Now let C denote the category of Chu spaces with

morphisms and composition defined as above.
Given a Chu space C = (A, r, X) over the set Σ, its dual is C⊥ = (X, r⊥, A) where r⊥ : X × A → Σ is defined by r⊥(x, a)= r(a, x) for any (x, a) ∈ X × A. For any morphism ϕ : A → B, ϕ⊥ = (ϕ−, ϕ+): B⊥ → A⊥. Thus, ⊥ is a contravariant functor on C.
Since the satisfaction relation r of a Chu space A = (A, r, X) is a function from A × X to Σ, we can regard it as a table with rows on A, columns on X and values on Σ. Then we can define two kinds of equivalence relations in a natural way. One is on the rows, where the a-th row corresponds to the function r(a, −) : A → Σ. Two rows of a and b are equivalent if r(a, −) = r(b, −), that is, they are repeated lines in the table of r. Similarly, equivalence can be defined on columns, by equality r(−, x) = r(−, y) entailing x = y. A Chu space (A, r, X) is called extensional if r(−, x)= r(−, y) implies x = y, i.e., r does not contain repeated columns. Similarly, a Chu space (A, r, X) is separable if it does not contain repeated rows. In topological analogy, if we think of objects in A as points and attributes in X as open sets, then separable Chu spaces are those for which distinct points can be differentiated by the open sets containing them (such spaces are called T0 in Topology). A Chu space is biextensional if it is both separable and extensional. The full subcategory of C with extensional (biextenstional) Chu spaces as objects is denoted by E and B respectively.
In categorical terms, a morphism ψ : C1 → C2 is monic if for any other two morphisms ψi : C3 → C1 (i = 1, 2) such that ψ ◦ ψ1 = ψ ◦ ψ2, we have ψ1 = ψ2. In particular, monics on the category of Chu spaces are characterized in [4] as follows.
Proposition 2.2 In the category of Chu spaces, we have
A morphism ψ : A → B in C is monic if and only if ψ+ is injective and ψ− is surjective.
A morphism ψ : A → B in E is monic if and only if ψ+ is injective.
A morphism ψ : A → B in B is monic if and only if ψ+ is injective.
We denote the subcategories of C, E and B with monics as homomorphisms by iC, iE and iB, respectively. Note that although E and B are full subcategories of C, it is not the case for iE or iB relative to iC.
Corollary 2.3 A morphism ψ : A → B in C is an isomorphism if and only if both
ψ+ and ψ− are bijective.
Proof. It is obvious that ψ will be an isomorphism if both ψ+ and ψ− are bijective. Conversely, assume that ψ is an isomorphism. Then from Proposition 2.2, we know that ψ+ is injective and ψ− is surjective. Meanwhile, since ψ⊥ : B → A is also an isomorphism, (ψ⊥)+ is injective and (ψ⊥)− is surjective. While (ψ⊥)+ = ψ− and (ψ⊥)− = ψ+, both ψ+ and ψ− are then bijective.	 
We recall the well-known tensor product in the category of Chu space.
Definition 2.4 The tensor functor ⊗ : C×C → C in the category C of Chu spaces is defined as ([3]):

For any two Chu spaces A = (A, r, X) and У = (B, s, Y ), define A⊗У = (A × B, t, Hom(A, У⊥)), where for any (a, b) ∈ obj(A ⊗ У) and ϕ ∈ attr(A ⊗ У), t((a, b), ϕ)= r(a, ϕ−(b)) (also equals s(b, ϕ+(a)));
For any two morphisms ϕ : A → A' and ψ : У → У', ϕ ⊗ ψ : A⊗ У → A' ⊗ У' is defined by:
(ϕ ⊗ ψ)+(a, b)= (ϕ+(a), ψ+(b)) for any (a, b) ∈ obj(A⊗ У);
(ϕ ⊗ ψ)−(f ', g')= (ψ− · f ' · ϕ+, ϕ− · g' · ψ+) for any (f ', g') ∈ attr(A' ⊗ У').
According to the definition of homomorphisms in the category of Chu spaces, we know that the object set Hom(A, У⊥) in Definition 2.4 is just the collection of connecting morphisms (f : A → Y, g : B → X) from A to У⊥ such that r(a, g(b)) = s(b, f (a)) for any a ∈ A and b ∈ B.
Proposition 2.5 The tensor product of two extensional Chu spaces is extensional.
Proof. Let A = (A, r, X), У = (B, s, Y ) be two extensional Chu spaces, and (f, g), (f ', g') ∈ attr(A ⊗ У) be distinct. Then we have f /= f '. Otherwise, g /= g' and it follows that there exists an element b ∈ B such that g(b) /= g'(b). Since A is extensional, there exists an element a with r(a, g(b)) /= r(a, g'(b)). While s(b, f (a)) = r(a, g(b)), s(b, f '(a)) = r(a, g'(b)) and s(b, f (a)) = s(b, f '(a)), a contra- diction arises. So f cannot be equal to f '.
Since f /= f ', there exists a ∈ A with f (a) /= f '(a). Since У is extensional, there exists b ∈ B with s(b, f (a)) /= s(b, f '(a)). Thus t((a, b), (f, g)) = s(b, f (a)) /= s(b, f '(a)) = t((a, b), (f ', g')).	 
The tensor product of two monics in C may not be monic any more. Further- more, the tensor product behaves quite differently in distinct subcategories of C. For example, in the category iE, the tensor product of two extensional Chu spaces remains to be extensional, and from Proposition 2.2, we know that the tensor prod- uct of two monics is still a monic. However, in the category B tensor product of two biextensional Chu spaces may not remain biextensional, and this can be shown by the fact that the attribute set of the tensor product may be empty, as given in the next example.
Example 2.6 Let Σ = {0, 1}, A, B, A', X,X',Y and Y ' are all {0}, B' = {0, 1};
let r, r' and s be maps from A × X, B × Y and A' × X' to {0}, respectively. s'
maps B' × Y ' to Σ by s'(0, 0) = 0 and s'(1, 0) = 1. Let A = (A, r, X), У = (B, s, Y ),
A' = (A', r',X') and У' = (B', s',Y '). Further, let ϕ = (id, id) : A → A' and ψ = (e, id): У → У', where id denotes the identity mapping and e is the embedding mapping from {0} to {0, 1}. It is clear that both ϕ and ψ are monics in C, but the tensor product ϕ ⊗ ψ is not since attr(A⊗ У) has one element while attr(A' ⊗ У') is empty.
Given the set Σ, we define a special Chu space f = ({ }, τ, Σ), where τ : { }× Σ → Σ satisfies τ ( , x) = x for any x ∈ Σ. Then f is obviously biextensional. Further, f has the unital property.

Proposition 2.7 f is the unit object in C, that is, for any Chu space A, A⊗f ∼= A
and f ⊗ A ∼= A with respect to natural isomorphisms.
Proof. First we prove that given a Chu space A, A⊗f ∼= A with respect to natural isomorphisms. In fact, let ϕ+ : obj(A⊗f) → obj(A) be: for any (a, ) ∈ obj(A⊗f),
ϕ+(a, ) = a; let ϕ− : attr(A) → attr(A ⊗ f) be: for any x ∈ attr(A), ϕ−(x) = 
A	A	A
(r(−, x), cx), where r is the satisfaction relation on A and cx is the constant function
onto x. Then it can be checked that (ϕ+, ϕ−) forms an isomorphism from A⊗ f to
A	A
A. Furthermore, it can be checked that the diagram
A⊗ f  ϕA	 A 
ψ⊗1I	ψ
' J	J 

A ⊗f ϕ
'	 A '

commutes for any morphisms ψ from one Chu space A to another A'. Thus ϕA is natural.
Likewise, we can prove that f ⊗ A ∼= A with respect to natural isomorphisms. Therefore, f is the unit object in C.	 
With the dual operator ⊥ and the tensor product ⊗, the linear operator  in the category C of Chu spaces is defined as ([3]):
Definition 2.8 The linear operator  : Cop × C → C is:
for any two Chu spaces A and У, A   У = (A⊗У⊥)⊥ = (Hom(A, У), t, obj(A) ×
attr(У));
for any two morphisms ϕ : A1 → A2 and ψ : У1 → У2, ϕ  ψ = (ϕ ⊗ ψ⊥)⊥ : (A2 ⊗ У⊥)⊥ → (A1 ⊗ У⊥)⊥ satisfies:
1	2
for any α ∈ obj((A2 ⊗ У⊥)⊥), (ϕ  ψ)+(α)= (ψ+ · α+ · ϕ+, ϕ− · α− · ψ−); for any (a1, y2) ∈ attr((A1 ⊗ У⊥)⊥), (ϕ  ψ)−(a1, y2)= (ϕ+(a1), ψ−(y2)).
We shall see that such a popular linear operator, when combined with the tensor
product defined above, will be troublesome for obtaining monoidal closedness.

E-bifinite Chu spaces
The notion of bifinite Chu spaces was introduced in [4], based on fundamental no- tions of ω-sequences, colimits, and finite objects of Chu spaces. In categorical terms, bifinite Chu spaces can be viewed as “countable” objects which are approximated by finite objects of Chu Spaces. In [4], many interesting results were developed. In this section, we introduce a new kind of Chu spaces, named E-bifinite Chu spaces, which are similar to, yet distinct from bifinite Chu spaces. In order to define E-bifinite Chu spaces, we need some preparations first.

Definition 3.1 An ω-sequence in iC is a family (Ci, ϕi)i≥1, where ϕi : Ci → Ci+1
is monic for each i ≥ 1.

Definition 3.2 A cone from an ω-sequence (Ci, ϕi)i≥1 to a Chu space C = (A, r, X) is a family of morphisms ψi : Ci → C such that ψi+1 ◦ ϕi = ψi, for all i ≥ 1, i.e., the diagram

A cone (C, (ψi : Ci → C)i≥1) is universal if for any other cone (C', (ψ' : Ci → C')i≥1)
such that ψ'	◦ ϕi = ψ' for all i ≥ 1, there exists a unique morphism ψ : C → C'
such that ψ ◦ ψi = ψ' for all i ≥ 1. Such a universal cone, if exists, is called the colimit of the family (Ci, ϕi)i≥1 and denoted by colimi≥1Ci. ψ is called the mediating map.
As had been pointed out in [4], ω-sequence of Chu spaces may have no colimit in the category iC. However, when colimits exist, we can provide an explicit construction, which is the standard construction in the category of sets, assimilated in the context of Chu spaces.

Construction 3.3 Let (Ci, ϕi)i≥1 be an ω-sequence of Chu spaces where Ci =

(Ai, ri, Xi) and ϕ+
: Ai → Ai+1 is the inclusion mapping, for each i ≥ 1. Con-

sider C = (A, r, X) where
A =  i≥1 Ai,
X = {(xj )j≥1 | ∀j ≥ 1, xj ∈ Xj & ϕ−(xj+1)= xj},
r(a, (xj)j≥1) = ri(a, xi) if a ∈ Ai (i ≥ 1).
Subsequently, we denote a sequence (xj)j≥1 ∈ X often by x˜.
For each i ≥ 1, define πi : Ci → C by π+(a) = a and π−(x˜) = xi for all a ∈ Ai
i	i
and x˜ ∈ X.
The satisfaction relation r is well-defined since if i ≥ 1 and a ∈ Ai, then xi = ϕ−(xi+1) so ri+1(a, xi+1)= ri(a, xi); inductively we obtain rj(a, xj)= ri(a, xi) for each j > i. Note that it is possible for the set Xl to be empty.
Clearly, πi is a morphism in the category of Chu spaces. For each x˜ ∈ X,
(ϕ− ◦ π− )(x˜)= ϕ−(xi+1)= xi = π−(x˜).


And for any a ∈ A,
i	i+1	i	i


(π+ ◦ ϕ+)(a)= a = π+(a).

i+1	i	i

Therefore, πi+1 ◦ ϕi = πi, and (ϕi : Ci → C)i≥1 is indeed a cone.
Such a construction gives the standard formulation of colimits in various cate- gories.
Proposition 3.4 If an ω-sequence of Chu spaces in iC has colimits, then they are isomorphic to the cone of Construction 3.3.
Theorem 3.5 Colimits exist in iE, as given in Construction 3.3.
By finite Chu structures, we mean that they are Chu spaces with finite object sets and finite attribute sets.
Theorem 3.6 Colimits exist in iB for ω-sequences of ﬁnite Chu structures and are isomorphic to the cone given in Construction 3.3.
Definition 3.7 An object F of iC (iE, iB) is finite if for every ω-sequence (Ci, ϕi)i≥1 of Chu spaces having a colimit in iC (iE, iB, respectively), for every morphism ϕ : F → colimi≥1Ci in iC (iE, iB, respectively) there exist an i ≥ 1 and a morphism ψ : F → Ci such that ϕ = ψi ◦ ψ. Namely, the diagram following diagram commutes.

Whether a Chu space is a finite object in iC or not can be checked with the following theorem given in [4].
Theorem 3.8 An object F = (B, s, Y ) is ﬁnite in iC if and only if B is ﬁnite and
F is extensional.
With this theorem, we know that finite objects are tensor multiplicative.
Corollary 3.9 The tensor product of two ﬁnite objects in iC is a ﬁnite object in
iC.
Proof. Let A and У be two finite objects in iC. By the preceding theorem, obj(A) and obj(У) are finite, and so obj(A⊗ У)= obj(A) × obj(У) is finite. In addition, A ⊗ У is extensional since so are both A and У. Thus again from the preceding theorem, we have A⊗ У is finite in iC.	 
Definition 3.10 A Chu space (A, r, X) over Σ is called complete, if for any map
f : A → Σ there is x ∈ X such that f = r(−, x).
Note that such completeness of Chu spaces is not tensor multiplicative, namely, the tensor product of two complete Chu spaces may not be complete. This can be

readily observed when the attribute set of the tensor product of two Chu spaces is empty.
By Theorem 3.8, Chu spaces having finite object sets and empty attribute sets are finite objects in iC, iE and iB. Further,
Theorem 3.11 In both categories iE and iB, a Chu space F with non-empty at- tribute set is a ﬁnite object if and only if it is complete and its object set obj(F) is ﬁnite.
A Chu space F is called strongly ﬁnite, if F = (A, r, X) is both a finite object in iC and a finite Chu structure. Here, the attribute set of a strongly finite Chu space is not required to be non-empty as in [4]. By Theorem 3.8, a Chu space is strongly finite if and only if it is extensional and has both finite object set and finite attribute set.
Definition 3.12 A Chu space is called E-bifinite if it is isomorphic to the colimit (with respect to iE) of an ω-sequence of strongly finite objects in iE. The corre- sponding full subcategory of E-bifinite Chu spaces of E and iE are denoted as Ebif and iEbif , respectively.
By definition, all strongly finite Chu spaces are E-bifinite. Moreover, all bifinite Chu spaces in the sense of [4] are also E-bifinite.
Here, we would like to point out the difference between the notions of E-bifinite Chu spaces just defined and bifinite Chu spaces as given in Definition 5.1 of [4]. In both cases, the objects of the ω-sequences considered are strongly finite spaces, but in Definition 3.12 the connecting morphisms in the ω-sequence are monics in E, whereas in [4] they are monics in C: refer again to Proposition 2.2 for the difference. Hence, formally, Ebif contains all bifinite Chu spaces (in the sense of [4]). More importantly, we have seen in Example 2.6 that the tensor product of two monics in C may not be monic anymore. However, the tensor product of two monics in E is monic again, and this is the very reason for our new definition of E-bifinite spaces.
In this context we note that in [4] and in this paper we could have replaced
ω-sequences of Chu spaces by co-directed systems of Chu spaces.
A family of Chu spaces {Ci}i∈I with monics ϕi,j : Ci → Cj whenever i ≤ j is a co-directed system if:
the index set I is directed, that is, for any i, j ∈ I, there exists k ∈ I such that
i ≤ k and j ≤ k;
ϕi,i is the identity on Ci for any i ∈ I;
ϕi,k = ϕj,k · ϕi,j for any i ≤ j ≤ k.
With a co-directed system of Chu spaces, we can readily reformulate most of notions introduced in [4], such as cone, colimit, finiteness, completeness, in the same manner. Further, a similar construction as Construction 3.3 can be given as follows.
Construction 3.13 Let {ϕi,j : Ci → Cj}i≤j be a co-directed system of Chu spaces

in iC, where, Ci = (Ai, ri, Xi).	Let the set A˜
= {{ai}i≥i0  : i0 ∈ I,  ai0  ∈

Ai, and for any j ≥ io, aj = ϕ+
(ai0 )}. In addition, deﬁne a binary relation ∼

on A˜ as: {ai}i≥i0 ∼ {a }i≥j iff there exists an k ≥ i0, j0 such that ak = a . Then
'	'

~ is an equivalence relationship on A˜. Denote every equivalent class of {ai}i≥i0 by
[ai0 ]. Then construct the Chu space C := (A, r, X) with
A = A˜/ ∼;
X = {(xj)j∈I | ∀j ∈ I, xj ∈ Xj & ϕ− (xj)= xi for any i ≤ j};
r([{ai}i≥i0 ], (xj)j∈I)= ri0 (ai0 , xi0 );
πi : Ci → C is: π+(a)= [{aj}j≥i] with ai = a; π−(x˜)= xi for any x˜ ∈ X.
i	i
One can check that r and πi’s are well defined, and {πi : Ci → C}i∈I forms a cone in iC. Then along with Construction 3.13 and similar arguments in [4], one can prove all main results in [4] and the results we will present subsequently, with a single exception in [4]: the existence of colimit in iCbif . The proof for the ω- sequence case in iCbif employed Ko¨nig’s Lemma which holds for countable finitely branching trees but not for all larger cardinalities.
In our present definition of E-bifinite spaces, we could also use arbitrary co- directed systems instead of ω-sequences. However, we prefer to work with the present definition as it stresses the computability aspect: the E-bifinite spaces can be constructed from strongly finite ones by a countable process.

The tensor product in E-bifinite Chu spaces
In this section we show that Ebif and iEbif are monoidal categories. First we recall the classical definition of monoidal categories ([5]).
Definition 4.1 A monoidal category A is a category equipped with a bifunctor
⊗ : A × A → A called the tensor product, and an object I called the unit object, such that
⊗ is associative with respect to natural isomorphisms;
⊗ has I as left and right identity;
for any objects A, B, C and D in A, the diagram


((A ⊗ B) ⊗ C) ⊗ D
αA⊗B,C,D
J 
αA,B,C ⊗D (A ⊗ (B ⊗ C)) ⊗ D  αA,B⊗C,D  A ⊗ ((B ⊗ C) ⊗ D)
A⊗αB,C,D
J 

(A ⊗ B) ⊗ (C ⊗ D)	αA,B,C⊗D	 A ⊗ (B ⊗ (C ⊗ D))
commutes, where α is the corresponding natural isomorphism;
for any objects A and B in A, the diagram
(A ⊗ I) ⊗ B 	αA,I,B	 A ⊗ (I ⊗ B)

¸¸¸¸¸
....

ρA⊗B¸¸¸¸z ,...A. ⊗λB
A ⊗ B

commutes, where ρ and λ denote the corresponding natural isomorphisms from A ⊗ I to A, I ⊗ B to B, respectively, and α the natural isomorphism with respect to the associative law.
With the tensor product and unit Chu space f introduced in Section 2, we know that the category C and E are monoidal categories. Next we show Ebif and iEbif are monoidal categories as well.
Proposition 4.2 If Σ is ﬁnite, then f is strongly ﬁnite and thus E-biﬁnite.
Proof. It follows directly from Theorem 3.8.	 
Proposition 4.3 The tensor product of two strongly ﬁnite Chu spaces is strongly ﬁnite.
Proof. Let A = (A, r, X), У = (B, s, Y ) be two strongly finite Chu spaces. Then A ⊗ У is extensional since so are both A and У. In addition, obj(A ⊗ У) and attr(A⊗ У) are finite. So A⊗У is strongly finite.	 
Proposition 4.4 Let (Ai, ϕi)i≥1, (Уi, ψi)i≥1 be two ω-sequences of strongly ﬁnite Chu spaces, where Ai = (Ai, ri, Xi), Уi = (Bi, si, Yi) for each i ≥ 1. Let A = (A, r, X)= colimi≥1Ai and У = (B, s, Y )= colimi≥1Уi be the colimit of (Ai, ϕi)i≥1 and (Уi, ψi)i≥1 respectively. Then colimi≥1(Ai ⊗ Уi) exists, and is isomorphic to A⊗ У.
Proof. Without loss of generality, assume all ϕ+’s and ψ+’s to be inclusion map-
i	i
pings, and let Ci = Ai ⊗ Уi and ηi = ϕi ⊗ ψi : Ci → Ci+1 for i ≥ 1. Note that Ci’s are
strongly finite and ηi’s are monic, so {(Ci, ηi)} is an ω-sequence of strongly finite Chu spaces with colimit (C, {αi : Ci → C}i≥1) as given in Contruction 3.3. We also assume A and У are given as in Contruction 3.3 as well.
Now define δ+ : obj(A ⊗ У) → obj(C) by δ+((a, b)) = (a, b) for any (a, b) ∈ obj(A⊗У). Since {Ai}i≥1 and {Bi}i≥1 are non-decreasing sequence of set, obj(A)= ( i≥1 Ai) × ( i≥1 Bi)=  i≥1(Ai × Bi)= obj(C). Thus δ+ is a bijection.
On the other hand, define a mapping δ− : attr(C) → attr(A⊗ У) by
δ−((fi, gi)i≥1)(a, b)= {(yi, xi)}i≥1
for any (fi, gi)i≥1 ∈ attr(C) and (a, b) ∈ obj(A⊗ У), where, under the assumption of both a ∈ Ai0 and b ∈ Bi0 for some i0 ≥ 1, yi = fi(a) and xi = gi(b) when i ≥ i0,
and inductively yi = ψ−(yi+1), xi = ϕ−(xi+1) for 1 ≤ i ≤ i0 − 1. Note that for any
i	i
{(fi, gi)}i≥1 ∈ attr(C), (fi, gi)= (ϕi ⊗ ψi)−((fi+1, gi+1)), that is, fi = ψ− · fi+1 · ϕ+
i	i
and gi = ϕ− · gi+1 · ψ+. Then it can be readily checked that δ− is well defined. We

show δ is a morphism from A⊗ У) to C.
In fact, let sA⊗B and sC denote the satisfaction relation on A ⊗ У and C, re- spectively. Then for any (a, b) ∈ obj(A⊗ У) and (fi, gi)i≥1 ∈ attr(C), it can be be checked that sC(δ+(a, b), (fi, gi)i≥1)= ri (fi (a), b)= sA⊗B((a, b), δ−((fi, gi)i≥1)).

Finally we show that δ is injective and surjective.

For any two distinct points (fi, gi)i≥1 ∈ attr(C) and (f ', g')i≥1 ∈ attr(C), there is

a j ≥ 1 with (fj, gj) /= (f ', g' ). Then fj /= f ' or gj /= g' , which entails the existence
j	j	j	j
of a point a ∈ obj(A) or a point b ∈ obj(У) such that f (a) /= f '(a) or f (b) /= g'(b).
So δ−((fi, gi)i≥1)(a, b) /= δ−((f ', g')i≥1)(a, b). Thus we know that δ− is injective.

Now for any (f, g) ∈ attr(A⊗ У), let fi = π'− · f · π+ and gi = ξ− · g · π'+, where
i	i	i	i
for i ≥ 1, πi : Ai → A and π' : Уi → У are as defined in the Construction. Then it can be checked that (fi, gi) ∈ attr(Ai ⊗ Уi) for all i ≥ 1, (fi, gi)i≥1 ∈ attr(C), and δ−((fi, gi)i≥1)= (f, g). Thus δ− is surjective.	 
From the two preceding propositions, we have
Corollary 4.5 The tensor product of two E-biﬁnite Chu spaces is biﬁnite.
Theorem 4.6 The category Ebif and iEbif of E-biﬁnite Chu spaces over ﬁnite Σ
are monoidal categories.
Proof. The finiteness of Σ entails that f is the unit object in Ebif and iEbif . The left is to directly check items (1), (3) and (4) in Definition 3.7 .	 
If Σ is infinite, there will be no unit object in the category of E-bifinite Chu spaces, with respect the tensor product defined above. Thus Ebif and iEbif , when over finite Σ, are not monoidal categories any more.
Proposition 4.7 There is no unit object in Ebif and iEbif if Σ is inﬁnite.
Proof. Assume that J = (D, t, Z) is a unit object in Ebif and iEbif . We show that Σ must be finite. Since for any E-bifinite Chu space A, A ⊗ J ∼= A implies
|obj(A⊗J )| = |obj(A)| by Corollary 2.3, |D| must be 1. Let D = {d0}.
Further, the attribute set Z should be finite. In fact, since J is bifinite, there exists an ω-sequence of {ϕi : Ci → Ci+1}i≥1 with ψi : Ci → J as its colimit, where Ci = (Ci, ri, Xi) is strongly finite for i ≥ 1. Since |obj(J )|=1, from Construction
3.3 we know that |Ci| = 1 for any i ≥ 1. Let Ci = {ci} for i ≥ 1. Note that for
any z ∈ Z, we have r1(c1, ψ−(z)) = t(ψ+(c1), z)= t(d0, z). Since J is extensional,
1	1
different choice of z will lead to different t(d0, z) and thus different ψ−(z), that is,
ψ− is an injection. Then the finiteness of X1 entails that of Z.
Finally, t : D × Z → Σ is a bijection and thus Σ is finite. In fact, since J is extensional, t is an injection and thus |Z| ≤ |Σ|. Assume that t is not a surjection and let z0 ∈ Σ − t(D × Z). Then let the Chu space A = ({a}, r, {b}) where r : {a}× {b} → Σ satisfies r(a, b)= z0. It can be readily checked that A⊗ J  A since attr(A) = 1 while attr(A⊗J ) = 0. A contradiction to the assumption that J is a unit object.	 

Non-monoidal-closedness of Ebif and iEbif
We will discuss about the non-monoidal-closedness of E-bifinite Chu spaces in this section. First, we recall the notion of monoidal closedness ([5]).

Definition 5.1 A monoidal category A with a tensor product ⊗ is closed if there is a bifunctor : Aop ×A → A such that for any objects B and C of A, the functor A  − is left adjoint to A ⊗ −, namely, Hom(A⊗ У, C) ∼= Hom(У, A  C) under natural isomorphisms in the category SET.
Without too much effort, one can show that the linear operator introduced in section 2 will lead the category C to monoidal closedness. However, such an operator is not appropriate to make Ebif or iEbif monoidal closed.
Example 5.2 The linear operator  is not a functor on neither Ebif nor iEbif . In fact, consider the Chu space A = (A, r, X) on Σ = {0, 1}, where A = X = {1, 2} and r(a, x) = 1 if a ≤ x and r(a, x) = 0 otherwise. Then Hom(A, A) = {ϕ = (c1, c2),ψ = (id, id)}, where c1 and c2 are the constant mapping from {1, 2} to 1 and 2, respectively, and id is the identity mapping on {1, 2}. And the satisfaction relation t : Hom(A, A) × (A × X) → Σ is:


From this table, we can observe that A  A is not extensional and so is not strongly finite. Thus the linear operator is not closed in the categories Ebif nor iEbif .
Further, consider the operator & defined in [3] as: A&У = A⊥   У. With the same A in the preceding example, we can observe that & is still not a functor on neither Ebif nor iEbif . In fact, we believe that when assigned with the tensor product of Definition 2.4, the category of E-bifinite Chu spaces will never be closed with respect to any linear operator on it. So we give the following claim.
Claim 5.3 Neither Ebif nor iEbif can be monoidal closed with respect to the tensor product in Deﬁnition 2.4.

Conclusion
In [4], Droste and Zhang introduced the notion of bifinite Chu spaces and studied a number of their interesting properties. In this paper, we continue their work by introducing a new type of bifinite Chu spaces called E-bifinite Chu spaces. We have shown that the subcategories Ebif and iEbif of Chu spaces are monoidal when Σ is finite. However, neither Ebif nor iEbif is monoidal closed with respect to the standard tensor product and linear operator. We believe, although have not yet proven, that there are no linear operators which would make the respective categories monoidal closed using the standard tensor product.
