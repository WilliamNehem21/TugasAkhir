Abstract
We continue the study of the dcpos which are determined by their Scott closed set lattices. Such dcpos are called Cσ -unique. Some new sufficient conditions for a dcpo to be Cσ -unique are given. One example is constructed to show that a Cσ -unique dcpo need not be dominated. Thus the question whether the dominated dcpos form a maximal Γ-faithful class of dcpos is negatively answered. Using a recent result by Zhao and Xi, we also deduce that every T1 topological space has a dcpo model that is Cσ-unique.
Keywords: Cσ -unique; Scott topology; Dominated dcpo; Γ-faithful; Stratified Johnstone dcpo.


Introduction
We call a T0 space X C-unique if for any T0 space Y , X is homeomorphic to Y whenever the closed set lattice of X is isomorphic to that of Y . A T0 space is C-unique iff it is sober and TD (see [1,12,17]). Our aim here is to investigate the analogous objects in the context of directed complete posets. A dcpo P is called

Cσ-unique [17] if for any dcpo Q, P is isomorphic to Q iff the Scott closed set lattices of P and that of Q are isomorphic. The main questions we are interested are: (i) Which dcpos are Cσ-unique? (ii) Can we have a complete characterization for Cσ- unique dcpos like that for C-unique T0 spaces? In [6], the authors constructed a counter example to show that there are dcpos which are not Cσ-unique. A class L of dcpos is called Γ-faithful if for any two P, Q in L, P and Q are isomorphic iff the Scott closed lattices of P and that of Q are isomorphic (see [6],[15]). The class of all quasicontinuous dcpos is Γ-faithful; the class of all upper bounded complete dcpos is Γ-faithful; the class of all dominated dcpos is Γ-faithful. A Γ-faithful class L of dcpos is said to be maximal if it is not a proper class of another Γ-faithful class of dcpos. For instance the class of all complete lattices is Γ-faithful [7], but not maximal. It is, however, still not known whether the class of all dominated dcpos is maximal. In this paper we constructed one non dominated dcpo and show that it is Cσ-unique. This then shows that a Cσ-unique dcpo need not be dominated (all examples of Cσ-unique dcpos considered in [17] are dominated), and thus the class of all dominated dcpos is not a maximal Γ-faithful class. We shall also establish some new sufficient conditions for a dcpo to be Cσ-unique. Another derived result is that every T1 topological space has a dcpo model that is Cσ-unique.

Preliminaries
We quickly recall some basic notions and results (see [2] for more details).
Let (L, ≤) be a poset. A principal ideal (resp., principal ﬁlter ) of L is a set of the form ↓x = {y ∈ L | y ≤ x} (resp., ↑x = {y ∈ L | x ≤ y}). For A ⊆ L, we write ↓A = {y ∈ L | ∃ x ∈ A, y ≤ x}, ↑ A = {y ∈ L | ∃ x ∈ A, x ≤ y}. A subset A is a lower set (resp., an upper set ) if A = ↓A (resp., A =↑ A). We say that z is a lower bound (resp., an upper bound ) of A if A ⊆↑ z (resp., A ⊆↓ z). The set
of lower bounds of A is denoted by lb(A). The supremum of A is denoted by W A
or sup A. The infimum of A is denoted by V A or inf A. A nonempty subset D
of L is directed if every finite subset of D has an upper bound in D. We will use sup↑ D to denote the supremum of directed set D. A poset L is a directed complete partially ordered set (dcpo, for short) if every directed subset of L has a supremum. A complete lattice is a poset in which every subset has a supremum.
An element x of a poset is maximal if x ≤ y implies x = y for any element y.
The symbol Max(P ) will denote the set of all maximal elements of P .
A subset A of a poset P is Scott closed if (i) A =↓ A and (ii) for any directed subset D ⊆ A, W D ∈ A whenever WD exists. The set of all Scott closed sets of P
will be denoted by Cσ(P ). The complements of Scott closed sets are called Scott
open sets, which form a topology σ(P ), called the Scott topology on P . The space (P, σ(P )) is sometimes denoted by ΣP .
A subset A of a topological space is irreducible if whenever A ⊆ F1 ∪ F2 with F1 and F2 closed, then A ⊆ F1 or A ⊆ F2 holds. The set of all nonempty irreducible closed subsets of space X will be denoted by Irr(X).

For any T0 topological space (X, τ ), the specialization order ≤τ on X is defined by x ≤τ y iff x ∈ cl({y}), where “cl(·)” means taking closure.
Remark 2.1 (1) For any topological space X, (Irr(X), ⊆) is a dcpo. If D is a directed subset of Irr(X), the supremum of D in (Irr(X), ⊆) equals cl( D) (the closure of  D), which is the same as the supremum of D in the complete lattice of all closed sets of X.
For any x ∈ X, cl({x}) ∈ Irr(X). A T0 space X is called sober if Irr(X)= 
{cl({x}): x ∈ X}, that is, every nonempty irreducible closed set is the closure of a point.
Assume that (X, τ ) and (Y, η) are topological spaces such that the open set lattices (τ, ⊆) and (η, ⊆) of X and Y are isomorphic, then the closed set lat- tice (C(X), ⊆) of X and the closed set lattice (C(Y ), ⊆) of Y are also isomorphic (they are dual of the corresponding open set lattices). Since irreducibility is a lattice-intrinsic property, it follows that the dcpos (Irr(X), ⊆) and (Irr(Y ), ⊆) are isomorphic.
For any poset P , the specialization order determined by the Scott topology on P equals the original partial order on P . Hence two poset P and Q are isomorphic iff their Scott spaces are homeomorphic.
For a T0 space X, a soberification of X is a sober space Y together with a continuous mapping ηX : X → Y , such that for any continuous mapping f : X → Z with Z sober, there is a unique continuous mapping fˆ : Y → Z such that f = fˆ◦ηX .
The sobrification of a T0 space is unique up to homeomorphism.
Remark 2.2 The following facts about sober spaces and sobrifications are well- known.
If Y is a sober space, then Y is a sobrification of a T0 space X iff the closed set lattice C(X) of X is isomorphic to the closed set lattice C(Y ) of Y (Equivalently, the open set lattice of Y is isomorphic to that of X). From this fact, one deduces easily that if X and Y are both sober spaces and the lattice C(X) is isomorphic to the lattice C(Y ), then X and Y are homeomorphic.
The set Irr(X) of all nonempty closed irreducible sets of a T0 space X equipped with the hull-kernel topology is a sobrification of X, where the mapping ηX : X → Irr(X) is defined by ηX (x)= cl({x}) for all x ∈ X. The closed sets of the hull-kernel topology consists of all sets of the form h(A)= {F ∈ Irr(X): F ⊆ A} (A is a closed set of X).
See Exercise V-4.9 of [2] for details (where the topology was given by means of open sets).
A T0 space X will be called Scott sobrifiable if there is a dcpo P such that ΣP is the sobrification of X.
The specialization order on the space Irr(X) (with the hull kernel topology) equals the inclusion order of sets. From the above, we can easily deduce the following fact.

Remark 2.3 A T0 space (X, τ ) is Scott sobrifiable iff for any Scott closed set F of the dcpo Irr(X), there is a closed set A of X such that F = h(A), where h(A)= {F ∈ Irr(X): F ⊆ A}.
Definition 2.4 [6] Let P be a poset and E ⊆ P be nonempty. A subset F of P is E-dominated if there is e ∈ E such that F ⊆↓ e. A family F of subsets of P is said to be E-dominated if every F ∈F is E-dominated. A poset P is called dominated, if for all E ∈ Irr(P ) and all directed E-dominated family D ⊆ Irr(P ), the set  D is E-dominated. A dcpo P is said to be locally dominated if every principal ideal in P is dominated.
Since every irreducible Scott closed set in a principal ideal of a dcpo P is itself an irreducible Scott closed set in P , it is easy to see that every dominated dcpo is locally dominated. The example in Proposition 4.10 in the sequel shows that the converse is not true.
Let J be the dcpo constructed by Johnstone in [9] (We follow Goubault-Larrecq to use this symbol for Johnstone’s dcpo). It is easy to see that J is dominated. In [17], it was proved that J is Cσ-unique. We will show that a Cσ-unique dcpo may not be dominated.
Some sufficient conditions for Cσ-unique dcpos
In this section, we give some new sufficient conditions for a dcpo to be Cσ-unique.
Definition 3.1 Let P be a dcpo. An element x ∈ P is called a Cσ-unique element if the principal ideal ↓x is Cσ-unique. If every element of P is a Cσ-unique element, then we call P a locally Cσ-unique dcpo.
A T0 space X is called bounded-sober if every nonempty upper bounded (with respect to the specialization order on X) closed irreducible subset of the space is the closure of a point [15]. Every sober space is bounded-sober, the converse implication is not true. It is easy to see that, for a dcpo P , ΣP is bounded sober iff every principal ideal of P is sober. In this case, we call P a bounded sober dcpo.
The proof of the following proposition is similar to that of Theorem 3.9 in [17].
Proposition 3.2 Let P be a bounded sober dcpo whose every element is a directed sup of Cσ-unique elements. Then P is Cσ-unique.
Corollary 3.3 Let P be a dcpo whose every principal ideal is quasicontinuous. Then P is Cσ-unique.
Proof. Note that the Scott space of every quasicontinuous dcpo is sober and every quasicontinuous dcpo is Cσ-unique. By the assumption on P , we deduce that every principal ideal of P is sober, hence P is bounded sober. Also every element of P is Cσ-unique. By Proposition 3.2, it follows that P is Cσ-unique.	2
Remark 3.4 A dcpo whose every principal ideal is quasicontinuous is also called a locally quasicontinuous dcpo. A dcpo model of a T1 topological space X is a dcpo

P such that the maximal point space Max(P ) (the set of all maximal points of P equipped with the relative Scott topology) is homeomorphic to X. In one of their recent papers, Zhao and Xi established the remarkable theorem [16, Theorem 2] that every T1 space has a dcpo model which is locally quasialgebraic (hence locally quasicontinuous). This result shows that there are plenty of locally quasicontinuous dcpos linked to T1 topological spaces. By Corollary 3.3, one can now deduce that every T1 space has a dcpo model that is Cσ-unique.
Proposition 3.5 Every principal ideal in J is quasicontinuous.
Proof. Let x ∈ J. If x is not a maximal element, then ↓ x is a finite chain, hence a continuous dcpo. If x is maximal, then ↓ x is isomorphic to a dcpo of the form P = N ∪ B ∪ {T}, where B is a countable union of disjoint finite chains, N has the order of natural numbers, the elements in N are not comparable with elements in B and T is the largest element.
For every a ∈ P , let Fn = {a, n}(n = 1, 2, ··· ). We see that for all directed set
{di}i∈I , Wi∈I di ≥ a implies that there is some i0 such that di0 ≥ a or di0 ≥ n. This
shows that Fn  a. The family {Fn} is clearly directed and  ↑ Fn =↑ a. So, ↓ x
is quasicontinuous. Thus every principal ideal in J is quasicontinuous.	2
By Corollary 3.3 and Proposition 3.5, we deduce the following.
Corollary 3.6 (1) The non-sober dcpo J is Cσ-unique.
A locally quasicontinuous dcpo need not be a quasicontinuous dcpo.
Theorem 3.7 The product poset J × J is Cσ-unique.
Proof. Every principal ideal in J × J is isomorphic to the product of two principal ideals in J. By [14], any finite product of quasicontinuous domains is quasicontin- uous, hence every principal ideal in J × J is quasicontinuous. Therefore J × J is Cσ-unique.	2
Remark 3.8 (1) It is known that a product of two sober spaces is sober space. However, it is not known whether the product of two sober dcpos is a sober dcpo. Sober dcpos need not be Cσ-unique. One example is the dcpo Hˆ constructed in [6].
(2) Every bounded sober dcpo is dominated.
Definition 3.9 Let P be a dcpo. An element x ∈ P is called a q.c.-element if the ideal ↓x is quasicontinuous.
It is easy to see that a dcpo P is a locally quasicontinuous dcpo iff every element of P is a q.c.-element. By Corollary 3.3, every locally quasicontinuous dcpo is Cσ-unique.
Example 3.10 There exists a dcpo P whose all elements are directed sup of con- tinuous elements (x is call continuous if ↓ x is continuous), but P is not locally quasicontinuous. One such an example is the dcpo of infinite many parallel unit intervals with their top elements being pasted as one top element.
By the proof of Theorem 3.7, one can easily deduce the following remark.

Remark 3.11 (i) A finite product of locally quasicontinuous dcpos is still a locally quasicontinuous dcpo.
(ii) Every nonempty Scott closed subset of a locally quasicontinuous dcpo is a locally quasicontinuous dcpo.
Definition 3.12 An element x in a dcpo D is called a w1q.c.-element (resp., w1Cσ- unique element) if x is a directed sup of some q.c.-elements (resp., Cσ-unique ele- ments). Inductively, for n > 1, an element x in a dcpo D is called a wnq.c.-element (resp., wnCσ-unique element) if x is a directed sup of some wn−1q.c.-elements (resp., wn−1Cσ-unique elements).
Theorem 3.13 Let P be a bounded sober dcpo. If every element of P is a wnCσ- unique element, then P is a Cσ-unique dcpo.
Proof. Applying Proposition 3.2 and mathematical induction, one can deduce that every element of P is Cσ-unique. The conclusion then follows from that P is bounded sober and Proposition 3.2.	2
Clearly, in a bounded sober dcpo P , every wnq.c.-element is a wnCσ-unique element. We immediately have the following
Corollary 3.14 Let P be a bounded sober dcpo. If every element of P is a wnq.c.- element, then P is a Cσ-unique dcpo.

A Cσ-unique dcpo which is not dominated
An element x of a lattice L is called ∨-irreducible (or just irreducible) if for any elements a, b ∈ L, x = a ∨ b implies x = a or x = b. In a distributive lattice L (such as a topology), an element x is ∨-irreducible iff for any elements a, b ∈ L, x ≤ a ∨ b implies x ≤ a or x ≤ b. Let Irr(L) be the set of all irreducible elements of L. Then with the inherited order from L, Irr(L) is a poset.
Remark 4.1 (1) Note that irreducibility is an intrinsic order property. If f : L → M is an order isomorphism between lattices, then f restricts to an isomorphism f : Irr(L) → Irr(M ).
For any T0 topological space X, let Irr(X) denote the set of all nonempty members of Irr(C(X)) (C(X) is the distributive complete lattice of all closed sets of X). If F : C(X) → C(Y ) is an order isomorphism, then F restricts to an order isomorphism between Irr(X) and Irr(Y ).
If B ∈ Irr(X) is a finite subset, then B = cl({x}) for some x ∈ X. In fact, assume that B = {b1, b2, ··· , bn}. Then B =  {cl({bi}) : i = 1, 2, ··· , n}, thus B = cl({bi0 }) for some bi0 .
Recall that a T0 space is called a d-space (or monotone convergence space) if for any directed subset D ⊆ X (with respect to the specialization order on X), sup D exists and D (as a net) converges to sup D.

Lemma 4.2 Let X and Y be T0 space and F : C(X) → C(Y ) be an order isomor- phism.
For any x ∈ X, if cl({x}) is a ﬁnite set, then F (cl({x})) = cl({y}) for some
y ∈ Y .
If X and Y are d-spaces and cl({x}) is a chain (with respect to the special- ization order), then F (cl({x})) = cl({y}) for some y ∈ Y .
Proof. (a) Assume that B = cl({x}) is a finite set. Then ↓B = {A ∈ C(X): A ⊆ cl({x})} is a finite set. As F is an isomorphism, F (↓B) =↓F (B) holds, so ↓F (B) is a finite set. Now {cl({y}): y ∈ F (B)} ⊆↓F (B), so it is a finite set. This implies that F (B) is a finite set (note that in a T0 space, different elements have different closures). By Remarks 4.1 (3), it follows that F (B)= cl({y}) for some y ∈ Y .
(b) Let H ∈ C(X), H /= ∅ and H ⊆ cl({x}). Then H is a chain, sup H exists and H converges to sup H. Since H is closed, sup H ∈ H, which implies that H = cl({supH}). Hence the set ↓C(X) cl({x}) − {∅} = {cl({u}): u ∈ cl({x})} is a chain.
Clearly F restricts to an isomorphism between ↓C(X) cl({x}) − {∅} and ↓C(Y ) F (cl({x})) − {∅}. Hence ↓C(Y ) F (cl({x})) is a chain. In particular, F (cl({x})) is a chain (with respect to the specialization order on Y ). Again as F (cl({x})) is a closed set and Y is a d-space, we have F (cl({x})) = cl({y}) for some y.	2
Corollary 4.3 Let P and Q be dcpos such that there is an order isomorphism F : Cσ(P ) → Cσ(Q). If a principal ideal ↓ x ⊆ P is a chain, then F (↓ x) =↓ y for some y ∈ Q. Further more, if ↓x is a ﬁnite set, then ↓y is also a ﬁnite set.
The following are some more properties of J which can be verified easily based on the construction of J.
Remark 4.4 (1) The nonempty irreducible sets in J are exactly the principal ideals and J itself [6].
If D ⊆ J−Max(J) is directed, then there is (n, ∞) ∈ J such that D ⊆↓ (n, ∞), hence D is a chain.
If a subset F contains infinitely many points in Max(J), then the Scott closure of F equals J.
If D ⊆ J − Max(J) is Scott closed, then D =  i∈I ↓ (i, mi) is a union of incomparable chains for some I ⊆ N with m ∈ N for all i ∈ I. Conversely, if D =  i∈I ↓ (i, mi) is a union of incomparable chains for some I ⊆ N with mi ∈ N for all i ∈ I, then D ⊆ J − Max(J) is Scott closed.
Using the dcpo J, we now construct a dcpo LJ which is Cσ-unique but not dominated.
Example 4.5 Let LJ = {(n, m, h): n, h ∈ N,m ∈ N ∪{∞}} ∪{(n, ∞, ∞): n ∈ N}.
Define the relation “ ≤ ” on LJ by (n, m, h) ≤ (s, t, k) if
h = k and (n, m) ≤ (s, t) holds in J, or
h < k and t = ∞ and (n, m) ≤ (s, t) in J, or

h < k = t = ∞ and n ≤ s and (n, m) ≤ (s, t) in J.
Then it is straightforward to verify that the relation ≤ is a partial order on LJ
and (LJ, ≤) is a dcpo, called stratified Johnstone dcpo.
In LJ, for each h ∈ N, the subdcpo Lh = {(n, m, h): n ∈ N,m ∈ N ∪ {∞}} will be called the h-th layer of LJ.
It is routine to verify the following:
{(n, ∞, ∞): n ∈ N} = Max(LJ), the set of maximal points of LJ.
For each i ∈ N, the i-th layer Li ∼= J is a copy of J (it is isomorphic to J via the mapping (n, m, h) '→ (m, n)) and Max(Li)= {(n, ∞, i): n ∈ N}.
A point in the set fin(Li)= Li − Max(Li) will be called a finite-point. It is easy to see that finite-points in different levels are incomparable in LJ. So for every set A ⊆ fin(Li), one has also ↓A ⊆ fin(Li).
If t < s then ↓Lt ⊆↓Ls. As a matter of fact,
↓Ls =  {Lt : t ≤ s}.
For any t, ↓ Lt is Scott closed.
The subposet LJ∞ = {(n, m, h)|m = ∞ or h = ∞} of non finite elements in
LJ is isomorphic to J.
We will show that the dcpo LJ is Cσ-unique.
Firstly, we show that Irr(LJ)= {↓x : x ∈ LJ}∪ {↓ Lh : h ∈ N ∪ {∞}}. We will derive this by proving several lemmas and propositions.
Lemma 4.6 If F ∈ Irr(LJ) and F ⊆↓ Lt for some t ∈ N, then F is either a principal ideal or F =↓ Lh for some h ≤ t.
Proof. Choose the largest h ∈ N such that F ∩Lh /= ∅. Clearly, h ≤ t and F ⊆↓ Lh.
If h = 1, then by Remark 4.4(1) and L1 ∼= J, we see that F is a principal ideal or F = L1.
Now let h > 1.
If F ∩ Max(Lh) is infinite, then by the property of Scott closed set of LJ, we have Max(Lh) ⊆ F , implying F =↓ Lh.
If F ∩ Max(Lh) is a nonempty finite set, then
F =↓ Max(F ) ⊆↓ (F ∩ Max(Lh))∪↓ Lh−1∪ ↓ (Max(F ) ∩ Lh − Max(Lh)).
Noticing that Max(F ) ∩ Lh − Max(Lh) ⊆ Lh − Max(Lh) = fin(Lh), we see by Example 4.5(2) that
↓ (Max(F ) ∩ Lh − Max(Lh)) ⊆ fin(Lh).
Since F is Scott closed, it is easy to see by Remark 4.4(4) that ↓ (Max(F ) ∩ Lh − Max(Lh)) is closed w.r.t. directed sups in LJ and hence ↓ (Max(F ) ∩Lh − Max(Lh)) is Scott closed.
Since F is irriducible, and not contained in ↓ Lh−1∪ ↓ (Max(F ) ∩Lh − Max(Lh)), we have




which further implies
F ⊆↓ (F ∩ Max(Lh)),

F =↓ (F ∩ Max(Lh)).

Let F ∩ Max(Lh) = {x1, x2, ··· , xk}. Then F =  {↓ xi : i = 1, 2, ··· , k}, thus
F =↓xi for some i, hence a principle ideal.
Lastly, assume that F ∩ Max(Lh)= ∅. Then F ⊆↓ Lh−1∪ ↓ (F ∩ fin(Lh)). As F is Scott closed, in this case, ↓ (F ∩ fin(Lh)) = F ∩ fin(Lh) is Scott closed. Since F is irreducible and F /⊆↓ Lh−1, we have F ⊆ F ∩ fin(Lh) and F = F ∩ fin(Lh). Noticing that F ∩ fin(Lh) is also a Scott closed subset of Lh ∼= J and contains no maximal elements of Lh, we have F = F ∩ fin(Lh) is an irreducible closed set of Lh. So, by Lemma 4.4(1), F =↓ b for some b ∈ Lh − Max(Lh).
To sum up, we have shown that F is a principal ideal or F =↓ Lh for some
h ≤ t.	2
Proposition 4.7 For any h ∈ N ∪ {∞}, ↓Lh is an irreducible Scott closed set.
Proof. What we only need to show is that ↓ Lh is irreducible. To this end, let F, G ∈ Cσ(LJ) with F ∪ G ⊇↓ Lh. Then either F or G contains infinite many maximal points of Lh ∼= J. So by the closedness of F and G and the method of showing J is irreducible in itself, either F or G contains Lh. Noticing that F and G are lower sets, we see that either F or G contains ↓ Lh, showing that ↓ Lh is irreducible.	2
Proposition 4.8 If F ∈ Irr(LJ), then F ∈ {↓ x : x ∈ LJ}∪ {↓ Lh : h ∈ N ∪ {∞}}.
Proof. Suppose that F ∈ Irr(LJ) and F /= LJ =↓ L∞. Let Mh = {n : (n, ∞, h) ∈ F ∩Max(Lh)} for h ∈ N, where Max(Lh) is the set of maximal points of the subdcpo Lh. Then {Mh}h∈N is a decreasing family of subsets of N. If for every h ∈ N, |Mh| (the number of elements in Mh) is infinite, then, by the closedness of F , we see that for all h ∈ N, ↓ Lh ⊆ F and F = LJ, contradicting to the assumption that F /= LJ. So, there is s ∈ N such that Ms is a finite subset of N. Since {Mh}h≥s is decreasing, there is t ≥ s such that Mh = Mt for all h ≥ t. If Mt = ∅, then F ∩ Max(Lh)= ∅ for all h ≥ t and by Example 4.5(2), F ∩ (  k∈N Lt+k) is a lower set and closed
w.r.t. directed sups in LJ, and thus F ∩ (  k∈N Lt+k) ∈ Cσ(LJ). It follows from
F = (F∩↓ Lt) ∪ (F ∩ ( j∈N Lt+j)) and irreducibility of F that F ⊆↓ Lt. By Lemma 4.6, F is a principal ideal or F =↓ Lh for some h ≤ t.
If Mt /= ∅, then F ∩L∞ is a nonempty finite set of L∞. Let Mt = {n1, n2,   , nk}
with ni ≤ nj iff i ≤ j. Then Max(F )∩L∞ = F∩L∞ = {(ni, ∞, ∞): i = 1, 2,   , k}.
Let w = t ∨ nk. Then in this case F ⊆↓ (F ∩ L∞)∪ ↓ Lw∪ ↓ ((Max(F ) − L∞) ∩ w<h∈N Lh) which is a union of finite many Scott closed sets. By the irreducibility of F , we see that F ⊆↓ {(ni, ∞, ∞) : i = 1, 2, ··· , k} and thus is a principal ideal. To sum up, we have shown that F is a principal ideal or F =↓ Lh for some h ∈ N ∪ {∞}.	2
Combining the above propositions, we deduce the following theorem.

Theorem 4.9 In LJ, Irr(LJ)= {↓ x : x ∈ LJ}∪ {↓ Lh : h ∈ N ∪ {∞}}.
Proposition 4.10 The dcpo LJ is locally dominated but not dominated.
Proof. It is easy to see that ↓ Lh ⊆↓ (h+1, ∞, ∞). So, {↓ Lh : h ∈ N}⊆ Irr(LJ) is directed and LJ-dominated. However, {Lh : h ∈ N} is not LJ-dominated, showing that LJ is not a dominated dcpo. To show that LJ is locally dominated, we need only show every principal ideal determined by a maximal point (n, ∞, ∞) in LJ is dominated. In fact,
Irr(↓ (n, ∞, ∞)) = {↓ x : x ∈↓ (n, ∞, ∞)}∪ {↓ Lh : h = 1, 2, ··· , n}.
For every E =↓ L with h ≤ n, and any directed E-dominated family D ⊆ Irr(↓ (n, ∞, ∞)), it is easy to see that D contains only principal ideals and the union  D is an ideal, which has a sup in E =↓ Lh and thus is E-dominated. There is no need to check for E =↓ x. So, ↓ (n, ∞, ∞) is dominated.	2
Theorem 4.11 Let Q be a dcpo satisfying Cσ(LJ) =∼ Cσ(Q). Then LJ ∼= Q.
Proof. Let F : Cσ(LJ) ∼= Cσ(Q) be an isomorphism. We define inductively a monotone map f : LJ → Q first, and then show that f is an order isomorphism. We define f : LJ → Q by the following steps:
Step 1: For each element (n, m, h) ∈ Lh with m, h /= ∞, we see that ↓ (n, m, h) is a finite chain and by Corollary 4.3, there is y(n,m,h) ∈ Q such that F (↓ (n, m, h)) =↓ y(n,m,h). We let f ((n, m, h)) = y(n,m,h). It is clear that f is order preserving when restricted to these elements.
Step 2: For each element (n, ∞, h) ∈ Lh with h /= ∞, we see that (n, ∞, h) = 
sup↑ {(n, m, h): m ∈ N} and

F (↓ (n, ∞, h)) = sup
Irr(Q)
F ({↓ (n, m, h): m ∈ N} = sup↑
{↓ y(n,m,h) : m ∈ N}.

Let y(n,∞,h) = sup↑{y(n,m,h) : m ∈ N}. Then F (↓ (n, ∞, h)) =↓ y(n,∞,h). We let
f ((n, ∞, h)) = y(n,∞,h). Note that if (n, ∞, h) < (n, ∞, k), then


↓ (n, ∞, h) ⊆↓ (n, ∞, k),
↓ y(n,∞,h) = F (↓ (n, ∞, h)) ≤ F (↓ (n, ∞, k)) = F ( sup
Irr(LJ)


↓ (n, m, k)) = sup
Irr(Q)



↓ y(n,m,k) =↓ y(n,∞,k).

By considering the restriction of f to the elements in Step 1 and Step 2, we can see that f is monotone.
Step 3: For each element (n, ∞, ∞) ∈ L∞, we see that the set (n, ∞, ∞) = sup↑{(n, ∞, h) : h ∈ N}.  So, {y(n,∞,h) : h ∈ N} is directed.  Let y(n,∞,∞) =
sup↑ {y(n,∞,h) : h ∈ N}. Then F (↓ (n, ∞, ∞)) =↓ y(n,∞,∞). We let f ((n, ∞, ∞)) =
y(n,∞,∞).
We now have defined a map f : LJ → Q satisfying the condition that F (↓x) =↓
f (x) =↓yx for all x ∈ LJ. It is easy to see that f is well defined and is injective. It

is also easy to see that
(n, m, h) ≤ (s, t, k) ⇐⇒ f ((n, m, h)) = y(n,m,h) ≤ f ((s, t, k)) = y(s,t,k).
For the surjectivity of f , we first show that f (LJ) is a lower set of Q.
Let y ∈↓ f (LJ). Then there is some y(n,m,h) in f (LJ) such that y ≤ y(n,m,h). Then F−1(↓y) ⊆↓ (n, m, h) is an irreducible Scott closed set in LJ. So, by Theorem 4.9, F−1(↓ y) is either a principal ideal or ↓ Ls for some s ∈ N. If F−1(↓ y) is a principal ideal ↓ x, then ↓ y = F (↓ x) and y = f (x) ∈ f (LJ). If F−1(↓ y) =↓ Ls for some s ∈ N, then (p, r, 1) ∈↓ Ls = F−1(↓ y) for all p, r ∈ N. So, y(p,∞,1) ≤ y ≤ y(n,m,h) and thus (p, ∞, 1) ≤ (n, m, h) for all p ∈ N. This is impossible in LJ. Hence F−1(↓y) must be a principal ideal and therefore y = f (x) for some x ∈ LJ, showing that f (LJ) is a lower set of Q.
It is easy to show, by the definition f , that the set f (LJ) is closed with respect to directed sups. Thus f (LJ) is a Scott closed subset of Q.
Since F is an isomorphism between the lattices Cσ(LJ) and Cσ(Q), we see that


Q = F (LJ)= F ( sup
Cσ (LJ)
{↓x : x ∈ LJ})

= sup {F (↓x): x ∈ LJ
Cσ (Q)
= sup {↓f (x): x ∈ LJ}.
Cσ (Q)
For each x ∈ LJ, we have ↓ f (x) ⊆ f (LJ) and f (LJ) is a Scott closed set of Q. It holds then that supCσ (Q){↓f (x): x ∈ LJ}⊆ f (LJ). Therefore Q ⊆ f (LJ), which implies Q = f (LJ). Hence f is also surjective. The proof is thus completed.    2
A class C of dcpos is said to be maximal with regard Γ-faithfulness, if C is Γ-faithful and for all dcpo D /∈ C, the class C∪ {D} is not Γ-faithful.
Let DOMDCPO be the class of all dominated dcpos. It is known that DOMD- CPO is Γ-faithful by [6].
Corollary 4.12 The class DOMDCPO ∪{LJ} is Γ-faithful. Hence the class DOMDCPO is not maximal with regard to Γ-faithfulness.
Remark 4.13 (1) It is still quite remote from deriving a complete characterization of Cσ-unique dcpos. At the moment, we even do not have a meaningful necessary condition for Cσ-unique dcpos.
(2) Some very basic questions on the product of Cσ-unique dcpos are not yet to be answered. For example, it is not known whether the cartesian product of two Cσ-unique dcpos is Cσ-unique.
