Bilinear pairing Security
Internet of Vehicles (IoV) enabled Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) allows smart vehicles to communi- cate with other vehicles on road, humans (customers or pedestrians), infrastructure (parking areas, traﬃc lights etc), Internet, Cloud etc. The vehicles communicate with other entities over wireless open channels directly or indirectly through messages or beacons. Open channel allows various attacks, like replay, man-in-the-middle, im- personation, fabrication etc., during communication. Also, malicious vehicles can be deployed in the network to misuse or have an unauthorized access to the services. To mitigate these issues, we propose a new remote access control scheme that ensures the secure communication among the vehicles. The vehicles are dynamic in nature
it has to register to the nearest trusted authority (𝑇 𝐴) in oﬄine or secured channel mode. To make it applica- in an IoV paradigm, that is, they are not under fixed domains. Therefore, whenever a vehicle changes its location ble, we propose remote registration of the vehicles via the 𝑇 𝐴. Access control mechanism occurs in two phases:
1) node authentication phase, where vehicles are remotely authenticated by 𝑇 𝐴 and 2) key agreement phase,
where after successful mutual authentication they compute a session key by using cryptographic techniques and pre-loaded information. The computed secret session keys are used for ensuring secure communications in future between two vehicles in a cluster as well. Informal security analysis along with formal security verification using the broadly-used Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) show that our access control scheme is secured against various potential attacks. We also show the competency of our scheme by comparing it with other existing schemes in terms of computation and communication costs.





Introduction

Internet of Things (IoT) combines various technologies like embed- ded systems, wireless sensors networks, control system appliance au- tomation, real time analysis, artificial intelligence, machine learning etc. Likewise, Internet of vehicle (IoV) is a concept/subset derived from the vast emerging concept IoT. It is an extended vehicular adhoc network (VANET) that modifies a vehicle into a smart vehicle by installing an on board unit (OBU) in them, thus making them eligible to communicate with other vehicles, humans (customers or pedestrians), infrastructure (parking areas, traﬃc lights), Internet, Cloud etc. Vehicles collect the information from the surroundings, and other vehicles. The collected information is comprehended to provide multiple services to the cus- tomers. IoV advances to claim a new concept of Intelligent Transporta- tion System (ITS) in smart cities. Smart vehicles (with installed OBU),
vehicle’s intelligence, diverse communication patterns, connection to In- ternet together forms ITS. ITS regulates the coordination between vehic- ular sensors, on board units, trusted platform module (TPM) etc.
ITS aims to provide safe, secured and luxurious on road experience to users. It provides safety by reducing accidents, generating warnings to avoid mis-happenings, emergency warnings, rule violation warnings etc. It offers comfort and infotainment applications like intelligent nav- igation, parking, file sharing, toll collection etc. It provides 24x7 high speed Internet access and multimedia services. It eﬃciently manages traﬃc on road, saves time and cost. IoV is quite similar to IoT as it bor- rows its technologies and benefits. But, at the same time it also has to deal with other crucial and strict requirements like limited communica- tion time, strict real time operations, specific bandwidth, heavy volume of data, scalability and most crucially ’security issues’. Various security issues arise because the vehicles communicate with other entities over

wireless open channel directly or indirectly through messages or bea- cons. Therefore, there is high demand for well managed, reliable and robust cybersecurity measures in ITS such as authentication mechanisms, identity preservation techniques, intrusion detection system, access con- trol schemes etc. These mechanisms would provide the required “secu- rity and functionality features to smart transportation”.
The authors in [10] provided a detailed taxonomy of various secu- rity protocols that are necessary to maintain a secured IoV environment. The basic security protocols related to IoV and other networking envi- ronments are categorized as key management like the schemes of [19], [32], [34], [16], [26], [43], authentication schemes such as [20], [39],
[36], [28], [35], [18], [44], [42], privacy preservation schemes such as
[11], [33], [47], [8], [25], [41], intrusion detection systems proposed
by [1], [23], [24], and access control schemes.
In this paper, we focus mainly on access control mechanism. An ac- cess control scheme ensures a secured environment to provide uninter- rupted services. IoV is a dynamic network where the location of the ve- hicle keeps changing every instant so does the nearest neighbors. Also, due to increasing population, the number of vehicles bought and reg- istered are increasing drastically everyday. Therefore, the need of an hour is to have an access control scheme which ensures that the mem- bers joining the cluster are authenticated and legal. On the other hand, an adversary can even deploy malicious nodes in the network to harm the integrity network. So it becomes necessary to be able to differen- tiate between a genuine and a malicious vehicle. Therefore a success- ful access control mechanism controls the flow of false, invalid, illegal and unauthorized information within the network. It also manages ac- cess permissions, monitors the scalable IoV architecture, handles huge amount of data stream, and also keeps a track of allocation and utiliza- tion of resources in the network.
An access control scheme accomplishes the requirement in two steps.
Node authentication: When a new node (a vehicle) wishes to join the network, the node should prove its legitimacy to the neighboring
nodes, by authenticating itself to the other existing nodes or 𝑇 𝐴,
after which it is deployed and allowed to communicate and access

ensure secured communication over a public channel. The key com- puted is to used to encrypt the messages shared further in the process that maintains the confidentiality and resists various attacks.
An eﬃcient access control mechanism should be able to add new nodes through out the network. That is, the increase in the network size should not affect the computation and communication time of the mechanism. It should also resist new node deployment attack where a malicious node should not be allowed to be deployed in the network and no existing node should be compromised. An access control mechanism should be able to maintain the functionality of the network even when few nodes are captured.

System models

The network and threat model is described as follows.

Network model

A general IoV network comprises of vehicle, RSU, TA. Vehicles are installed with sensors like location based system, monitoring/warning systems, analytic systems, partner systems, speed control, camera, mul- timedia settings, mass airflow sensor, engine speed sensor, spark knock sensor, coolant sensor, fuel temperature sensor, voltage sensor, smart card device, finger print device etc. The sensors of the vehicles collect the data from the surrounding via on-board unit (OBU) through a data collecting agent. The data collected is processed via inference logics to make decisions and is saved in tampered proof device (TPD). In our
ity (𝑇 𝐴). They can be single or multiple 𝑇 𝐴s to supervise a smart city. scheme, a vehicle remotely registers itself to the nearest trusted author- To preserve the identity, the 𝑇 𝐴s are the only entities to store the real
identities of the vehicles. After getting registered the vehicle is deployed in the the network. IoV enabled ITS supports various types of communi- cations like interactions with other vehicles via Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) communication. The vehicles exchange updated traﬃc related informa-
tion. The communication between 𝑇 𝐴 and vehicle occurs via Vehicle to
Infrastructure (V2I) communication. Vehicle to pedestrian, vehicle to cus-
tomer communication occurs via Vehicle to Human (V2H) communication through which vehicle provides user services and safe transportation fa- cilities to passengers and customers. Vehicles can even exchange infor- mation with personal devices through Vehicle to Personal devices (V2P) communication. The vehicles are installed with sensors and the commu- nication between them occurs via Vehicle to Sensor (V2S) communication
[40]. 𝑇 𝐴 checks the authenticity of the messages flown by the vehicle
therefore, the communication between the vehicle and 𝑇 𝐴 takes place in the network. Our proposed scheme supports remote authentication,
through “wireless medium using the IEEE 802.11p protocol” and “Ded- icated Short-Range Communications (DSRC)” [30].

Threat model

We have considered “Dolev-Yao threat (DY) model” [21] as the threat model for the proposed scheme. The model considers the follow- ing assumptions.
The communication channel between the end entities (vehicle or
𝑅𝑆𝑈 ) is considered insecure, open and public.
The end nodes like vehicles are not trusted, whereas the trusted au-
thorities (TAs) are assumed to be fully trusted entities.
Following to this the model considers an adversary A, with enough capabilities such the an adversary can perform fabrication, eaves- dropping, modification, tampering, deletion and replay attacks on the messages exchanged on the public communication channel.
The vehicles are equipped with tampered proof device in on board units where they store secret information and the stored information cannot be tampered.
Another threat model considered for this scheme is, “Canetti and Krawczyk’s adversary model (CK-adversary model)” [13]; also stated as a “current de facto standard model in modeling authenticated key- exchange protocols”. The model extends the capabilities of the adversary as in DY model. The model assumes that the adversary can not only eavesdrop or send the messages flown in the network like in DY model, but can also compromise the secret credentials, secret keys or session keys during the communication. This model is an essential model while analyzing the security of key exchange protocols because compromised secret credentials during communication should have least impact on the session key established.

[45] proposed an “anonymous and lightweight authentication for secure vehicular networks (ASC)” based on diﬃculty of Diﬃe-Hellman and Discrete Logarithm (DL) problem. Vehicles are issued with a smart card during registration. The scheme uses geo synchronised timestamps
in their vehicles. Vehicle proves its legitimacy to TA via 𝑅𝑆𝑈 and es- to achieve freshness. Users use their smart card and passwords to log

eﬃcient protocol. They assumed a single TA with multiple 𝑅𝑆𝑈 model, [17] addressed the short comings in ASC by [45] and proposed an where TA and 𝑅𝑆𝑈 always have secured communications. The vehicle sends a request message to 𝑅𝑆𝑈 which is relayed to 𝑇 𝐴 after checking its authenticity. The reply from the 𝑇 𝐴 is broadcasted to 𝑅𝑆𝑈 and other near by 𝑅𝑆𝑈 s. The use of passwords (used in ASC) is removed to avoid
password guessing attacks. Instead message authenticated codes (MAC) are added on all the messages exchanged with TAs to assure security and authenticity. The scheme is secured against “insider attack, stolen smart card attack, oﬄine password guessing attack, replay attack and impersonation attack”.
[46] designed a password based secure authentication protocol for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in vehicular communications. The pro- tocol is light weight and eﬃcient in communication an computation cost as it uses XOR operation and hash function. The sink nodes are deployed at fixed locations on the network. Users are authenticated by the sink nodes in the user authentication phase. Following to this, the data col- lected by authenticated vehicles is sent and collected in the sink node, which is accessed to provide user services in future. [38] claimed that the Yu et al.’s scheme cannot resist “sensor capture attack, user trace- ability attack, impersonation attack, and oﬄine sink node’s secret key guessing attack”. They proposed a two-factor authentication protocol in WSNs for IoV which overcomes the shortcomings of Yu et al.’s scheme. Their scheme by [38] uses biometric templates instead of passwords for authentication. A shared key is established between the user and sink node, also between a vehicle and sink node. Although the scheme is se- cured against replay, stolen sink node database, stolen smart card attack but it requires lots of storage space in the sink node’s memory and incurs heavy computation and communication cost. It does support revocation phases.
[44] proposed an “eﬃcient privacy-preserving mutual authentica-
tion scheme for secure V2V communications” where a vehicle is au- thenticated by a law executor. Once the authentication is successful, the vehicle receives authentication key and becomes a trustful vehicle until the key expires. Further, a trustful vehicle can also authenticate other vehicles by trust extended phase. Two trustful vehicles compute a session key and can have secure communications. Later, [42] proposed a two factor light weight authentication mechanism. The scheme incurs less computation overheads because it uses less expensive cryptographic operations like XOR operations and hashing. After authentication, a key is established between entities for secure communication. The session key computed in the schemes proposed by [42], and [44], is not secured against CK-adversary attack.
[3] proposed a “multi-factor secured and lightweight privacy- preserving authentication scheme (MSPF)”. The security of the scheme is



based on multiple authentication factors like physical unclonable func- tions (PUF), vehicle’s private key and one time pseudo identity. The mechanism is decentralized and reduces redundant authentications. Af- ter vehicle to central authority mutual authentication phase, a regional key is established which is valid until the vehicle reaches a new region.
[27] also proposed an authentication-based secure data dissemination protocol and framework for 5G-enabled VANET. The authenticated vehi- cles are allowed to exchange messages only after validating each other. The message integrity is checked by calculating the disparity in the com- munication bits.
[2] designed an “eﬃcient conditional privacy preservation with mu- tual authentication”. The TA divides the system into domains with speci-
fied number of 𝑅𝑆𝑈 s to cover the region. At the time of authentication,
the RSU provides a pool of pseudo identities and their corresponding
cation within the 𝑅𝑆𝑈 ’s coverage area. OBU uses the pseudo identity secret keys with expiry to the vehicle, that can be used for communi-
and the secret key from the pool to sign the traﬃc related message. The malicious vehicles’ secret key is not renewed once it has expired. The scheme incurs higher storage cost to store pool of identities and secret keys.
Another “mutual authentication and key agreement scheme” is de- signed in [9] where a cluster head is chosen in the dynamic cluster of vehicles and the authentication occurs in two levels. In the first level,
the cluster head and 𝑅𝑆𝑈 mutually authenticate each other,and in the
other level the authentication happens between two vehicles. After au-
phase. 3) Log in phase. 4) Authentication and verification phase. 5) Key agreement phase. 6) Password update phase. To avoid replay at- tacks we use timestamp while exchanging the messages. For that we assume that all the entities are synchronized with their clocks. Towards the end, we also propose a mechanism where the vehicle can any- time change its password if in case the password is lost or breached. The notations used through out the description of the scheme is de- fined in the Table 2. We now present the proposed scheme in following subsections.

Initial setup phase

The initial set up phase is performed by the 𝑇 𝐴 authorized for a smart city. The 𝑇 𝐴 sets it private and public key, and initializes the system by
computing public parameters by executing the following steps.
Step 1: In the first step, 𝑇 𝐴 chooses a non-singular elliptic curve
𝐸𝑞 (𝑢, 𝑣) of the form: 𝑦2 = 𝑥3 + 𝑢𝑥 + 𝑣 (mod 𝑞) such that 4𝑢3 + 27𝑣2 ≠ 0 (mod 𝑞). 𝑇 𝐴 also picks an additive group 𝐺1 with point at infinity U and a multiplicative group 𝐺2 with identity 1 of prime order 𝑞. It selects 𝑃 as a randomly-chosen generator of 𝐺1. It chooses 𝑒 as a bi- linear mapping 𝑒: 𝐺1 × 𝐺1 → 𝐺2 . The bilinear mapping has following
properties [12,37]:
Bilinearity: For all “𝑃 , 𝑄, 𝑅 ∈ 𝐺1, 𝑒(𝑃 + 𝑄, 𝑅) = 𝑒(𝑃 , 𝑅)𝑒(𝑄, 𝑅)
and 𝑒(𝑃 , 𝑄 + 𝑅) = 𝑒(𝑃 , 𝑄)𝑒(𝑃 , 𝑅)”. In general, for all “𝑎, 𝑏 ∈ 𝑍 ∗ =

thentication a session key is also established.
Recently, [5] proposed a “privacy-preserving and scalable authenti- cation protocol for the IoV” which is also based on “physical unclonable function (PUF)”. PUF is installed in the vehicle’s OBU. During registra- tion, vehicles generate crypto identity using PUF, random nonce and hashing, and send it to TA along with few challenge response pairs.
All 𝑅𝑆𝑈 s also store current challenge and nonce. During vehicle to TA
where 𝑅𝑆𝑈 consolidates request messages, creates a reply by encrypt- authentication phase, all vehicles send their crypto identities to RSU
ing and hashing, and forwards to RSU gateway. RSU gateway forwards the request to TA after verification. TA generates a token for each ver- ified vehicle containing a challenge and sends the authorized response
to the gateway. The gateway forwards the reply to all 𝑅𝑆𝑈 s in its re-
gion after which it is sent to vehicles. The vehicles generates a crypto-
identity using the challenge received in the token and acknowledges the TA.
Another “lightweight authentication and attestation scheme for in- transit vehicles” based on PUF is proposed by [4]. IoV cloud servers are database that stores the challenge responses and other information. TA
registers vehicles and 𝑅𝑆𝑈 s. A vehicle sends an authentication request
message to 𝑅𝑆𝑈 whenever it comes in range of any 𝑅𝑆𝑈 . 𝑅𝑆𝑈 veri- fies the vehicle by contacting edge servers (attached to 𝑅𝑆𝑈 for stor-
age and computation purposes) for registration details. A session key is established which is used for encryption and for an in-transit attesta- tion mechanism that lets the edge servers verify the main ECU firmware installed in the vehicle. For attestation, both vehicle and edge server run an attestation algorithm and verify their checksums computed on memory blocks of ECU firmware using pseudo random functions. The primary ECU firmware after getting verified verifies other ECU’s present in the vehicle by same process.
Table 1 summarises the characteristics and limitations of the dis- cussed schemes.

The proposed scheme

In this section, we present a new remote access control scheme for
{1, 2, ⋯ , 𝑞 − 1}, 𝑒(𝑎𝑃 , 𝑏𝑄) = 𝑒(𝑃 , 𝑄)𝑎𝑏 ”.
Non-degeneracy: If 1𝐺1  denotes the identity in 𝐺1 , then
𝑒(𝑃 , 𝑃 ) ≠ 1𝐺1 for all 𝑃 ∈ 𝐺1 .
“𝑒(𝑃  ,  𝑄)    for    all    𝑃  ,  𝑄    ∈    𝐺1”. • Computability: There exists an eﬃcient algorithm to calculate
Step 2: In the second step, 𝑇 𝐴 randomly selects 𝑝𝑟𝑇 𝐴 ∈ 𝑍 ∗, and sets

it as its private key. Using its private key 𝑝𝑟𝑇 𝐴, 𝑇 𝐴 calculates its public key by 𝑃 𝑢𝑏𝑇𝐴 = 𝑝𝑟𝑇 𝐴 ⋅ 𝑃 .
Step 3: Next, 𝑇 𝐴 computes a public verification factor 𝑣𝑒𝑟 as, 𝑣𝑒𝑟 =
𝑒(𝑃 𝑢𝑏𝑇𝐴, 𝑃 ) and also chooses two cryptographic hash functions, de- fined as ℎ(⋅): {0, 1}∗ → {0, 1}∗, and 𝐻 : {0, 1}∗ → 𝐺1 .
Step 4: Finally, 𝑇 𝐴 publicly publishes the system parameters: {𝐺1,
𝐺2 , 𝑒, 𝑞, 𝑃 , ℎ(⋅), 𝐻 (⋅), 𝑃 𝑢𝑏𝑇𝐴, 𝑣𝑒𝑟} at the end of the set up phase.

Registration phase

The 𝑇 𝐴 is responsible for registering vehicles before their deploy- ment. 𝑇 𝐴 maintains a database where it stores the unique number of
vehicles (VUN) assigned by Regional Transport Oﬃce (RTO) at the time of buying a vehicle. So, when a new vehicle wishes to join the network it needs to register itself to its corresponding TA. To successfully register
vehicle 𝑉𝑖 , following steps are performed between 𝑉𝑖 and 𝑇 𝐴.
Step 1: Vehicle 𝑉𝑖 chooses its unique identity 𝐼𝐷𝑖 and calculates its pseudo identity 𝑅𝐼 𝐷𝑖 as 𝑅𝐼 𝐷𝑖 = 𝐻 (𝐼𝐷𝑖 ). 𝑉𝑖 sends its pseudo iden- tity 𝑅𝐼 𝐷𝑖 , and hashed unique number ℎ(𝑉 𝑈𝑁𝑖 ) to 𝑇 𝐴 via a secure channel. For instance, the information {𝑅𝐼 𝐷𝑖 , ℎ(𝑉 𝑈𝑁𝑖 )} can be en- crypted with the help of the public key of the 𝑇 𝐴 and the encrypted credentials can be sent via public channel to the 𝑇 𝐴, and the 𝑇 𝐴 will decrypt the encrypted credentials using its own private key 𝑝𝑘𝑇 𝐴.
Step 2: On receiving 𝑅𝐼 𝐷𝑖 , ℎ(𝑉 𝑈𝑁𝑖 ) from 𝑉𝑖 , 𝑇 𝐴 checks for the
presence of ℎ(𝑉 𝑈𝑁𝑖 ) in its database. If the entry is present in its
of the same vehicle. If ℎ(𝑉 𝑈𝑁𝑖 ) is not present in the database, it database it stops the further process to avoid multiple registration

registration process. 𝑇 𝐴 computes 𝑅𝑒𝑔𝐼𝐷 as, 𝑅𝑒𝑔𝐼𝐷 = 𝑝𝑘𝑇 𝐴 ⋅ 𝑅𝐼 𝐷𝑖 .

smart transportation. The scheme is based on the architecture described in Section 2.1. According to our scheme, initially a vehicle remotely
mutually authenticates 𝑇 𝐴 and then both vehicle and 𝑇 𝐴 compute se-
cret session key for secure communication in future. Our scheme oc-
𝑇 𝐴 chooses a temporary identity 𝑇 𝐼𝐷𝑖 for vehicle 𝑉𝑖 , and computes
pseudo temporary identity as 𝑅𝑇 𝐼𝐷𝑖 = ℎ(𝑇 𝐼𝐷𝑖 ‖𝑝𝑘𝑇 𝐴).
Step 3: Finally, 𝑇 𝐴 generates a current timestamp as 𝑇 𝑆𝑇𝐴1 , and
sends the registration reply message {𝑇 𝐼𝐷𝑖 , 𝑅𝑒𝑔𝐼𝐷 , 𝑅𝑇 𝐼𝐷𝑖 , 𝑇 𝑆𝑇𝐴 }

In login phase, user of vehicle 𝑉𝑖 inputs its identity 𝐼𝐷𝑖 and pass- word 𝑃 𝑊𝑖 associated with vehicle in the 𝑂𝐵𝑈𝑖. Then, 𝑂𝐵𝑈𝑖 executes

ℎ(𝐼𝐷𝑖 ‖𝑅𝑒𝑔𝐼𝐷 ‖ℎ(𝑟𝑖 ‖𝑃 𝑊𝑖)) and verifies if 𝑉 𝐴𝑖 = 𝑉 𝐴𝑖 is valid. If the
condition is not valid, the further processing is stopped, as the user has not provided the correct identity or password and is therefore not authenticated. And if valid, the user of the vehicle is authorized and has provided correct identity and password.
Step 2: Following this, 𝑂𝐵𝑈𝑖 generates two random nonces 𝑟1, 𝑟2 ∈
𝑍∗, and performs the following computations. It computes 𝑉 𝑍𝑖 =

Correctness proof

We provide below the correctness proof of our authentication, verifi- cation and key establishment phase that is described in Section 4.4 using the theorems 1 and 2.
Since the above equation holds, the message received from 𝑉𝑖 is valid.
Hence, the theorem follows.  □

session key computed by 𝑇 𝐴 ∶ 𝑆𝐾𝑇𝐴−𝑉𝑖 , is same as the session key computed Theorem 2. During the key establishment phase, described in Section 4.4, by vehicle 𝑉𝑖 ∶ 𝑆𝐾𝑉𝑖 −𝑇𝐴.
Proof. The session key computed by 𝑇 𝐴 after successful authentication is 𝑆𝐾𝑇𝐴−𝑉𝑖 = ℎ(𝑅𝑒𝑔𝐼𝐷𝑖 ‖𝑉1 ‖𝑉 𝑌𝑖 ). And the session key computed by 𝑉𝑖
after receiving authentication reply message is 𝑆𝐾𝑉 −𝑇𝐴 = ℎ(𝑅𝑒𝑔𝐼𝐷 ‖𝑉 ∗

Informal security analysis

We analyze the proposed access control scheme informally in the following propositions, and show that our scheme is resilient against various known attacks.
Proposition 1. Proposed remote access control scheme is secured against replay attack.
Proof. Three messages are exchanged in our scheme to accomplish au- thentication and session key establishment. The first message is a regis-
tration reply message {𝑇 𝐼𝐷𝑖 , 𝑅𝑒𝑔𝐼𝐷 , 𝑅𝑇 𝐼𝐷𝑖 , 𝑇 𝑆𝑇𝐴 } which is sent from
pends on the long term secrets like 𝐼𝐷𝑖 , 𝑃 𝑊𝑖 . Therefore an adversary
cannot impersonate vehicle 𝑉𝑖 as the long term secrets are not known to
him.  □
Proposition 5. Proposed remote access control scheme is protected against privileged-insider attack.
Proof. During the registration phase described in Section 4.2, 𝑉𝑖 sends its pseudo identity 𝑅𝐼 𝐷𝑖 to 𝑇 𝐴 via public channel to get 𝑅𝑒𝑔𝐼𝐷𝑖 , 𝑅𝑇 𝐼𝐷𝑖 , and temporary identity 𝑇 𝐼𝐷𝑖 . To perform insider attack, any privileged user of 𝑇 𝐴 being an attacker gets to know the registration details 𝑅𝐼 𝐷𝑖 . However, even if the attacker gets exposed to 𝑅𝐼 𝐷𝑖 , he/she still does
not get to know anything about the real identity of the vehicle. Hence,

𝑇 𝐴 to 𝑉𝑖 . The second is during log in phase, where a vehicle sends an
authentication request message {𝑇 𝐼𝐷𝑖 , 𝑉 𝐹𝑖 , 𝑉 𝐺𝑖 , 𝑉 𝐿𝑖 , 𝑟1 , 𝑇 𝑆𝑉𝑖1 } to TA and third is an authentication reply message as {𝑄𝑖, 𝑉2 , 𝑉3 , 𝑉4 , 𝑇 𝑆𝑇𝐴2 } sent to 𝑉𝑖 from 𝑇 𝐴. All the messages include the current timestamp
𝑇 𝑆𝑇𝐴1 , 𝑇 𝑆𝑉𝑖1 , 𝑇 𝑆𝑇𝐴2 . On receiving the messages, the receiver checks
the freshness of the message by finding the delay in the message. The delay in message is calculated by computing the difference in the re-
our scheme is protected against privileged insider attack.  □
Proposition 6. Proposed access control scheme is secured against ephemeral secret leakage (ESL) attack.
Proof. During authentication, verification and key establishment phase,
𝑇 𝐴 computes a session key as 𝑆𝐾𝑇𝐴−𝑉𝑖 as 𝑆𝐾𝑇𝐴−𝑉𝑖 = ℎ(𝑅𝑒𝑔𝐼𝐷𝑖 ‖𝑉1 ‖𝑉 𝑌𝑖 )
and the vehicle computes a session key as 𝑆𝐾𝑉 −𝑇𝐴 = ℎ(𝑅𝑒𝑔𝐼𝐷 ‖𝑉 ∗ ‖(𝑟2 ⋅

we have considered a very small value Δ𝑇 𝑆 as the difference in times-
tamp values. Hence, including the timestamp in every message assures
that the scheme is secured against replay attacks.  □
Proposition 2. Proposed remote access control scheme is secured against OBU physical capture attack.
Proof. During the vehicle registration phase described in Section 4.2,
𝑂𝐵𝑈𝑖 stores the credentials {𝑇 𝐼 𝐷𝑖 , 𝑉 𝐷𝐼 𝐷𝑖 , 𝑉 𝐷𝑖 , 𝑉 𝐴𝑖 , 𝑉 𝐵𝑖 } in its mem- ory, and deletes {𝑅𝑒𝑔𝐼𝐷 , 𝑅𝑇 𝐼𝐷𝑖 } permanently from its memory. So if the adversary has physically stolen 𝑂𝐵𝑈𝑖 of vehicle 𝑉𝑖 , he/she can extract all the credentials from 𝑂𝐵𝑈𝑖 using power analysis attack. As
seen in the registration phase, 𝑉 𝐷𝐼𝐷𝑖 = 𝑅𝑒𝑔𝐼𝐷 + 𝐻 (𝑃 𝑊𝑖 ‖𝑟𝑖 ), 𝑉 𝐷𝑖 =
puted using long term secrets which are private key 𝑝𝑟𝑇 𝐴 of 𝑇 𝐴 and identity of the vehicle 𝐼𝐷𝑖 . The session key also depends on short term secret values like 𝑟3, 𝑟2. Therefore an adversary needs both long term and
short term secrets to compute session key. If by any ways, an attacker manages to know short term secret values based on the CK-adversary model by [13] as discussed in the threat model, still he would need to
know the long term secrets 𝐼𝐷𝑖 , 𝑃 𝑊𝑖 to acquire the session key.  □
Proposition 7. Proposed access control scheme is secured against mas- querading attack.
Proof. During authentication, verification and key establishment phase,

𝑅𝑇 𝐼 𝐷 ⊕ ℎ(𝐼 𝐷

the adversary needs to know 𝑟𝑖 , 𝐼𝐷𝑖 , 𝑃 𝑊𝑖 . Therefore it can clearly be
concluded that the adversary cannot know any secret credentials by

needs to calculate parameters like 𝑄𝑖 , 𝑉2 etc. All the parameters in the he/she would try to forge the valid authentication reply. For that he reply message depends on secret values 𝐼𝐷𝑖 , 𝑝𝑘𝑇 𝐴. Moreover the session key is also depended on secret 𝑅𝑒𝑔𝐼𝐷𝑖 . Hence it is clear that our scheme
can withstand masquerading attack as the attacker is incapable to create
a forged reply.  □

To create request message, the adversary has to perform computations

𝑟2 ⋅ 𝑃 𝑢𝑏𝑇𝐴 +𝑅𝑒𝑔𝐼𝐷𝑖 , 𝑉 𝐿𝑖 = ℎ(𝑟2 ⋅ 𝑃 𝑢𝑏𝑇𝐴 ‖𝑅𝐼 𝐷𝑖 ). For this the adversary
can generate two random nonces 𝑟1 , 𝑟2 . For computing 𝑉 𝑍𝑖 he needs to know 𝑉 𝐷𝑖 , 𝑅𝐼 𝐷𝑖 , 𝑃 𝑊𝑖 and 𝑟∗. Let us also assume that he can extract
𝑉 𝐷𝑖 from the memory of 𝑂𝐵𝑈𝑖 as explained in 2, but he still cannot
using 𝑉 𝐹𝑖 and 𝑉 𝐿𝑖 as there are two low entropy parameters < 𝐼𝐷𝑖 , 𝑟2 >

know 𝑅𝐼 𝐷𝑖 , 𝑟∗ as it depends on secret 𝐼𝐷𝑖 , 𝑟1 and 𝑃 𝑊𝑖 . Therefore it
would be impossible for an attacker to create authentication request
without knowing the secret values. Hence the scheme is secured against man-in-the-middle attack. □
Proposition 4. Proposed remote access control scheme is resilient against vehicle impersonation attack.
Proof. To impersonate a vehicle 𝑉𝑖 , and adversary A might try to in- tercept the authentication request message {𝑇 𝐼𝐷𝑖 , 𝑉 𝐹𝑖 , 𝑉 𝐺𝑖 , 𝑉 𝐿𝑖 , 𝑟1 ,
It is also noticeable from Section 4.4 that the value of 𝑄𝑖 is relied on
𝐼𝐷𝑖 which is protected under hash functions. Hence it is impossible for
the attacker to guess the identity in polynomial time.  □
Proposition 9. Proposed access control scheme resists vehicle traceability attack.

Formal security verification using AVISPA tool: Simulation study

To formally analyze the security of the proposed access control scheme we have used the widely accepted simulation tool named as “Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA)” [6]. AVISPA has become the common tool that is used to ver- ify the security protocols based on various cryptographic techniques. The simulation process occurs in two steps. First, a formal language is used to specify the protocols and other security properties. Initially the protocol is coded in “High-Level Protocol Specification Language (HLPSL)” which is then transformed in “Intermediate Format (IF)” with the help of HLPSL2IF translator. Following to this in the second step, where the code is provided as input to any back-end of the tool which analyzes the security of the protocol.
The AVISPA tool consist of four back-ends:
“On-the-fly Model-Checker (OFMC)”
“Constraint Logic based Attack Searcher (CL-AtSe)”
“SAT-based Model-Checker (SATMC)”
“Tree Automata based on Automatic Approximations for the Analysis of Security Protocols (TA4SP)”.
The output or the result from the back-ends is displayed in the “Out- put Format (OF)” which is comprehended in different sections. In the first section called as “SUMMARY” the output displays whether the pro- tocol is “safe, unsafe, or inconclusive”. The second section called as “DE- TAILS” elaborates on the reason on why the protocol is summarized as “safe, unsafe or inconclusive”. The third section is “PROTOCOL” sec- tion that defines the “HLPSL specification of the target protocol in inter- mediate form”. Next, section is the “GOAL” which specifies the actual goal of the analysis of the protocol. And the last section displays the name of the back-end that is chosen to process the security analysis.
HLPSL implementation that consists of two basic roles of 𝑇 𝐴, 𝑉𝑖, the To analyze the security of our proposed scheme we have coded the
other compulsory roles of session and goal & environment. We have con- sidered the registration phase discussed in Section 4.2, log in phase dis- cussed in Section 4.3 and authentication, verification and key establish-
ment phase discussed in Section 4.4 where 𝑇 𝐴 authenticates the vehicle
and both 𝑇 𝐴 and vehicle compute a session key.

fed into the knowledge of the intruder, and the intruder can even im- itate all other roles. According to the “Dolev-Yao (DY) threat model”
[21] discussed in Section 2, AVISPA simulation allows the intruder to “eavesdrop, modify, delete, or insert messages during communication”. The broadly used “Security Protocol ANimator for AVISPA (SPAN)” tool
[7] is used to perform formal security verification simulation under the environment: “Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS having Memory: 7.7GiB, Processor:
Intel®Core𝑇𝑀 i7-8565U CPU @ 1.80GHz × 8, OS type: 64-bit, Disk:

in Figure 6 which shows the results using OFMC back-end. Thus we can

clearly state that the proposed access control scheme is secured against “replay and man-in-the-middle-attacks”.


Comparative analysis

The eﬃciency of the scheme can be asserted in terms of computa- tion and communication cost. The computation time is the total time taken by the all cryptographic techniques in the scheme to execute. And the communication cost is defined as the number of bits (messages) ex- changed during the execution of any scheme. In this section we calculate the communication, computation of our scheme and also compare it to other existing access control schemes. Later, we also compare all the schemes in terms of security and functionality features.


Computation costs comparison

The cryptographic techniques which are used in the schemes are “el- liptic curve point multiplication”, an “elliptic curve point addition”, a “bilinear pairing operation”, a “modular exponentiation”, a “one-way hash function”, a “symmetric key encryption/decryption”. We use the
notation 𝑇𝑒𝑐𝑚, 𝑇𝑒𝑝𝑎, 𝑇𝑏𝑝, 𝑇𝑒𝑥𝑝, 𝑇ℎ and 𝑇𝑒𝑛𝑐∕𝑑𝑒𝑐 for each respectively. To
time for each operation. For 𝑇𝑒𝑐𝑚, 𝑇𝑒𝑐𝑎, 𝑇𝑏𝑝, 𝑇𝑒𝑥𝑝, 𝑇ℎ and 𝑇𝑒𝑛𝑐∕𝑑𝑒𝑐 the exe- generalized and fair comparison we have considered specific estimated
cution time taken is 17.10 ms ([31]), 4.4 ms ([14]), 42.11 ms, 19.2 ms
([31]), 0.32 ms ([14]) and 0.32 ms, respectively.
The cryptographic operations during login, and authentication, ver- ification and key establishment phases (discussed in Sections 4.3 and 4.4) in our scheme, are “elliptic curve point multiplication, elliptic curve
way hash function”. The total computation cost comes out to be 15𝑇ℎ+ point addition, bilinear pairing operation, modular exponentiation, one- 5𝑇𝑒𝑐𝑚+ 3𝑇𝑒𝑐𝑎+ 𝑇𝑏𝑝+ 𝑇𝑒𝑥𝑝. In Table 3, we have compared the computa-
tion costs of our scheme against existing schemes proposed by [17],
[38], [4], [2], [42] and [9]. Due to the use of bilinear pairings, our scheme requires more computational cost as compared to other existing schemes except the comparable computation cost as in [9]. However, it can be justified due to superior security and more functionality at- tributes provided by the proposed scheme as compared to existing com- peting schemes (see Table 5).

Communication costs comparison

As stated before the number of messages or number of bits exchanged during the execution of the scheme is said to be its communication overhead. To calculate this, we have considered some standard value to fairly compare all the schemes. The assumed value of “one-way cryp- tographic hash function” is considered as 256 bits. For ECC techniques we have considered 160 bits cryptosystem. Therefore, an elliptic curve
point 𝑃 = (𝑃𝑥, 𝑃𝑦) is (160 + 160) = 320 bits, where “𝑃𝑥 and 𝑃𝑦 are the
𝑥 and 𝑦 co-ordinates of the point 𝑃 ”. Further, a “vehicle’s real iden-
tity, random nonce and timestamp” are taken as 160, 160 and 32 bits,
respectively. For a “symmetric key encryption/decryption (for exam- ple, if the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-128) is used), the plain- text/ciphertext block size” will become 128 bits.
The authentication process in our scheme, is accomplished by ex- changing two messages. The first message is authentication request mes-
In Table 4, we have compared the communication costs of our scheme against existing schemes proposed by [17], [38], [4], [2],
[42] and [9]. It is noticed that the proposed scheme requires compa- rable communication cost as in [9]. However, the communication cost in the proposed scheme is low as compared to other remaining existing schemes as shown in Table 4.

Security and functionality features comparison

The comparative analysis on “security and functionality” features among the proposed scheme and other schemes proposed is provided in Table 5. We have considered few security and functionality features like resilience against “on-broad unit physical capture attack”, “insider attack” “replay attack”, “man-in-the-middle attack”. Other features like “mutual authentication”, “remote registration ”, “key agreement”, im-

tion overhead of our scheme is 2112 bits.
be clearly seen that our scheme excels in security and functionality fea- tures than other schemes. In Table 5, we have considered ✓: if “a scheme
is secure or assists a feature” and ×: if “a scheme is insecure or does not
assist a feature”.

Fig. 9. Performance analysis of all schemes for computational costs



















For overall comparison, we present the computation cost, commu- nication costs in bits and number of messages in Figures 7, 8 and 9, respectively. It can be seen that schemes like [38] and [42] have very low computation costs, but the communication cost is too high. In com- parison to this, our scheme shows a little more computation cost because of bilinear pairing but it uses minimum number of messages exchange to achieve mutual authentication and thus gives a tough competition in terms of communication cost to other schemes. In addition, our scheme excels in security and functionality features than other schemes.

Conclusion and future work

In this paper, we designed a remote access control mechanism as a

tion phase where any new vehicle can easily be registered via 𝑇 𝐴. Our a session key to communicate securely. We also propose a vehicle addi-
scheme also facilitates password update phase which allows vehicles to change their passwords if it is stolen or breached. Later, we analyze the security of our scheme informally and formally using AVISPA simulation to show that it can resist various well known attacks. Finally, a com- prehensive performance analysis shows the competency of our scheme against other existing schemes in terms of computation, communication costs. The comparison in security and functionality features shows that our scheme is superior to most of the existing schemes.
In recent years, the lattice-based cryptographic techniques are ap- plied in many networking environments due to its superior security as compared to the traditional public key cryptosystems as they are quan- tum resistant against various attacks as pointed out by [15] for designing “lattice-based secure cryptosystem for smart healthcare in smart cities”. Hence, in future we would like to explore to design more eﬃcient and secure system for IoV based on the lattice-based cryptography.
