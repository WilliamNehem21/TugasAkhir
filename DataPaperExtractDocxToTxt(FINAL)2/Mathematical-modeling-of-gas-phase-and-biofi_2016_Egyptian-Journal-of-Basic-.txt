Non-linear differential equations Adomian decomposition method
In this paper, mathematical models of biofilteration of mixtures of hydrophilic (methanol) and hydrophobic (α-pinene) volatile organic compounds (VOC’s) biofilters were discussed. The model proposed here is based on the mass transfer in air–biofilm interface and chemi- cal oxidation in the air stream phase. An approximate analytical expression of concentration profiles of methanol and α-pinene in air stream and biofilm phase have been derived using the Adomian decomposition method (ADM) for all possible values of parameters. Further- more, in this work, the numerical simulation of the problem is also reported using the Matlab program to investigate the dynamics of the system. Graphical results are presented and dis- cussed quantitatively to illustrate the solution. Good agreement between the analytical and numerical data is noted.

Introduction

Different cleaning technologies of gaseous effluents have been developed. Among these technologies, biological methods are increasingly applied for the treatment of air polluted by a wide variety of pollutants. Biofilteration is certainly the most com- monly used biological gas treatment technology. Biofilteration involves naturally occurring microorganisms immobilized in the form of biofilm on a porous medium such as peat, soil, compost, synthetic substances or their combination.
The medium provides to the microorganisms a hospitable environment in terms of oxygen, temperature, moisture, nu- trients and pH. As the polluted airstream passes through the filter-bed, pollutants are transferred from the vapor phase to the biofilm developing on the packing particles [1,2].
Recently Li et al. [3] as well as other research groups [4–10] have investigated emissions of VOCs into the atmosphere. Cur- rently, biological control processes have become an established technology for air pollution control. Biological control pro- cesses have many advantages over traditional methods such as lower operating fees and less secondary pollution, which

is rather true for the removal of readily biodegradable VOCs at low concentrations, so these processes are investigated largely and widely. Bioreactors for VOC removal can be classified as biofilters, bio scrubbers, biotrickling filters, or rotating drum biofilters, and choice of reactors should be based on many factors including the characteristics of the target VOCs [11–15]. In order to control the emission of volatile organic com- pounds (VOC) like methanol, α-pinene, etc. from industries, biofilters are being used nowadays instead of chemical complex absorption method [16–20]. Biofilters offer two major advan- tages to an energy-starved country like India. A mathematical model is describing the dynamic physical and biological pro- cesses occurring in a packed trickle-bed air biofilters to analyze the relationship between biofilter performance and biomass
accumulation in the reactor [4].
For the treatment of mixed VOCs [21–23], the presence of methanol and α-pinene in the air stream significantly influ- enced the removal of pollutants. The removal capacity for methanol and α-pinene per unit volume of the bed decreased linearly with increasing loading rates of methanol and α-pinene. The presence of this easily biodegradable compound sup- pressed the growth of the methanol and α-pinene degrading microbial community, thereby decreasing methanol and α-pinene removal capacity of the biofilters. Some researchers have studied the biofitration of pure methanol [24–26] and pure

Mass balance in the biofilm phase

The removal of methanol and α-pinene in the biofilm at steady state is described by the following system of non-linear dif- ferential equations (Mohseni and Allen [16]):

teractions between these compounds despite the fact that this situation exists in larger amount of air emissions. Mohseni and Allen [16] developed a mathematical model for methanol and α-pinene removal in VOC’s biofilteration. Lim et al. [29] devel- oped the steady state solution of biofilter model only for the limiting cases (first order and zero order kinetics). Also Lim et al. [30,31] obtained the non-steady solution of biofilter model using numerical methods. Recently some authors [32,33] solved the non-linear problems using fractional reduced differential trans- form method (FRDTM). To the best of our knowledge, to date,

Sub- scripts m and p represent methanol and α-pinene respectively. The dry cell density in the biofilm X represents the overall popu- lation of microorganisms that consist of methanol and α-pinene degraders. The coefficient for the effect of methanol on α-pinene biodegradation is defined as follows:

The mathematical model relating the biofiltration of blends of hydrophilic and hydrophobic VOCs is based on the biophysi- cal model proposed by Mohseni and Allen [16]. It includes two main processes of diffusion of the compounds methanol and α-pinene through the biofilm and their degradation in the biofilm.

Numerical simulation

In order to investigate the accuracy of the ADM solution with a finite number of terms, the system of differential equa- tions was solved numerically. To show the efficiency of the present method, our analytical results are compared with nu- merical results graphically. The analytical solution of the concentrations of methanol and α-pinene in air phase and biofilm phase are compared with simulation results in Figs. 3–6. Upon comparison, it gives a satisfactory agreement for all values
of the dimensionless parameters Sm*, Sp*, Cm* and C*p. The de- tailed Matlab program for numerical simulation is provided in Appendices C and D.

Results and discussion

Eqs. (19–22) represent the simple and new analytical expres- sion of the concentrations of methanol and α-pinene in biofilm

Fig. 5b, it is labeled that the concentration of methanol de- creases when half saturation constant of methanol β decreases for the fixed value of other parameter.
Fig. 6a, b demonstrates the concentration of α-pinene C*p in the air phase versus dimensionless height h*. From Fig. 6a, it is inferred that the concentration of α-pinene slowly reaches
a constant level when the diffusion coefficient φ1 increases for
the fixed value of other parameter. In Fig. 6b, it is labeled that the concentration of α-pinene attains the steady state values when the initial concentration of α-pinene  1  increases.
Fig. 7 shows the profile of dimension concentration of methanol and α-pinene in the air phase versus height h for some fixed value of the parameters. From these figures it is inferred that the concentration is linearly proportional to the
height of the biofilter. And also the concentration of Cm* and C*p decrease when the height of the biofilter increases. Fig. 8a, b illustrates the removal ratio of methanol and α-pinene in the
air phase. From this figure it is observed that the removal ratio
is directly proportional to the inlet loading. Our analytical results are compared with the experimental result and excellent agree- ment is noted.

centrations of methanol and α-pinene in the biofilm phase and the air phase depend upon the parameters φ and β. The varia- tion in the dimensionless variable φ can be achieved by varying either the thickness or dry cell density of the biofilm. The pa- rameter β depends upon the initial concentration and half saturation constant.
Fig. 3 represents the concentration of methanol Sm* in the biofilm phase versus dimensionless distance X* for different values of φ and β. From Fig. 3a, b, it is inferred that the con- centration of methanol increases when the initial concentration of methanol β increases for the fixed values of φ. For large value of dimensionless parameter β, the concentration of methanol remains constant. In Fig. 3c, d, we present the con- centration of methanol in the biofilm phase for various values of φ and for some fixed values of β. Maximum specific growth rate of methanol biodegradation φ decreases the concentra- tion of methanol slowly and reaches the constant level. The
minimum value of Sm* X* and S*p X* are 1   2 1    and
1  1 2 1  1  respectively.
Fig. 4 exhibits the concentration of α-pinene Sp* in the biofilm phase versus dimensionless distance X* for different values of , 1 and 1. From Fig. 4a, b, it is inferred that the con- centration of α-pinene increases when the initial concentration of α-pinene  1  increases for the fixed values of dry cell density φ1. For large value of β1, the concentration of α-pinene is uniform. In Fig. 4c, d, we show that the concentration of α-pinene in the biofilm phase for various values of cell density φ1 and for some fixed values of dimensionless parameter β1. From this figure, we conclude that the concentration of
α-pinene Sp* increases when thickness of the film decreases. The concentration of α-pinene is equal to one Sp*  1 when
Conclusion

In this paper, the non-linear differential equations in biofiltration model have been solved analytically. Approxi- mate analytical expressions pertaining to the concentrations of methanol and α-pinene in the biofilm phase for all the values of parameters are obtained using the Adomian decomposi- tion method. This solution of the concentrations of methanol and α-pinene in the biofilm phase and air phase are com- pared with the numerical simulation results. This model is also validated using experimental results. These analytical results provide a good understanding of the system and the optimi- zation of the parameters in biofiltration model.

Appendix B: Analytical solution of Eqs. (11) and (12)

In this appendix, we have derived the solution of Eqs. (11) and
(12) using the Adomian decomposition method. Eq. (11) can be written with the operator form
Appendix C: Matlab program for the numerical solution of Eqs. (11) and (12)









L(Sm* )  N(Sm* )
(B.1)	



wherethe differential operator L   d2  and N(S* )    Sm*	

dX*2	1   Sm*
(B.2)
x * x *
Applying the inverse operator L1 .    .dX*dX* on both	
0 1

sides of Eq. (B.1) yields

S* X*  AX*  B  L1   Sm*	



(B.3)

1   Sm* 

Where A  Sm* 1 and B  Sm* 0. We let,

Sm* X*  Sm* n X*
n0


N[S* X*]    Sm*	   A





(B.4)	


(B.5)

1   Sm*

In view of Eqs. (B.4) and (B.5), Eq. (B.3) gives




Sm* n
n0

X*  AX*  B  L1  An
n0


(B.6)



We identify the zeroth component as

Sm* 0 x*  AX*  B



(B.7)


Appendix D: Matlab program for the numerical solution of Eqs. (16) and (17)

and the remaining components as the recurrence relation



Sm*  X*  L1An, n  0
(B.8)



where An are the Adomian polynomials of Sm* 1, Sm* 2 ⋯ Sm* n. We can find the first few An as follows:


A0  N(Sm* 0 )   Sm* 0 
1   Sm* 0
(B.9)







A1   d [N(Sm* 0  Sm* 1 )]
d



 0
  Sm* 1 
1   2


(B.10)



The remaining polynomials can be generated easily, and so,	


Sm* 0 X*  1
(B.11)



S* x*   	  X*2  X* 

m1	1     2	
(B.12)

Adding (B.11) and (B.12), we get Eq. (19) in the text. Simi-
larly, we can apply the above method to find the solution of	 Eq. (12). Higher order iteration will be considered to improve
the accuracy of the results.
