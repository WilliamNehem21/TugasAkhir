Abstract
The Grammar Tool Box is a toolset for manipulating Context Free Grammars and objects asso- ciated with them such as parsers, languages and derivations. GTB has three main rˆoles: as a pedagogic tool; as an experimental platform for novel algorithms and representations; and as a production tool for translator front end generation. In this tool demonstration we give an overview of GTB and its companion Java-based animator tool PAT.
Keywords: Parsing, software animation

GTB is an environment for maipulating grammars and producing au- tomata and parsers from them. Most of our experimental work with GTB has focussed on the development of novel GLR parsing algorithms [4,3] and their comparison with existing algorithms, in particular that of Farshi [1].
We use the following grammar to highlight performance aspects of the algorithms:
SS::=S.
S ::= T ’b’.
T ::= A ’b’ | T T T.
A ::= T ’b’ A A A | T T ’b’ | #.
GTB can output intermediate structures in a form suitable for visualisa- tion with the VCG tool [2], but for many applications a dynamic animation is desirable. PAT is a parser animator which takes tables exported from GTB; constructs parse-time objects such as GSS’s and SPPF’s and then displays the
