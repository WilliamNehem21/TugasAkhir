Abstract
A b-coloring of a graph is a proper coloring such that each color class has at least one vertex which is adjacent to each other color class. The b-spectrum of G is the set Sb(G) of integers k such that G has a b-coloring with k colors and b(G) = max Sb(G) is the b-chromatic number of G. A graph is b-continous if Sb(G) = [χ(G), b(G)] ∩ Z. An infinite number of graphs that are not b-continuous is known. It is also known that graphs with girth at least 10 are b-continuous. In this work, we prove that graphs with girth at least 8 are b-continuous, and that the b-spectrum of a graph G with girth at least 7 contains the integers between 2χ(G) and b(G). This generalizes a previous result by Linhares-Sales and Silva (2017), and tells that graphs with girth at least 7 are, in a way, almost b-continuous.
Keywords: b-chromatic number; b-continuity; girth; bipartite graphs.


Introduction
Let G be a simple graph (for basic terminology on graph theory, we refer the reader to [4]). A function ψ: V (G) → N is a proper k-coloring of G if |ψ(V (G))| = k and ψ(u) /= ψ(v) whenever uv ∈ E(G). Because we only deal with proper colorings in this text, from now on we refer to them as simply a coloring. We call the elements of ψ(V (G)) colors. Given a color i ∈ ψ(V (G)), the set ψ−1(i) is called color class
i. We say that u ∈ V (G) is a b-vertex in ψ(of color ψ(u)) if ψ(N [u]) = ψ(V (G)). If for some color c ∈ ψ(V (G)), the color class c does not contain b-vertices, we can obtain a (k − 1)-coloring by changing the color of each vertex v ∈ ψ−1(c) to another color in ψ(V (G)) \ ψ(N [v]). We say that this new coloring is obtained from the first

one by cleaning color c. In a coloring such that we cannot apply this procedure, all color classes have at least one b-vertex. Such a coloring is called a b-coloring of G. Observe that an optimal coloring cannot have the number of colors decreased by the described algorithm; therefore every optimal coloring is also a b-coloring. In [8], the authors define the b-chromatic number of G, denoted by b(G), as the largest natural k for which G has a b-coloring with k colors. In the same article, the authors demonstrated that the problem of finding b(G) is NP-complete in general.
Another interesting aspect about b-colorings concerns its existence for every
possible value between χ(G) and b(G). In [8], the authors observe that the cube has a b-coloring using 2 colors and 4 colors, but has no b-coloring using 3 colors. Inspired by this result, in [9] it is shown that for any integer n ≥ 4 the graph obtained from the complete bipartite graph Kn,n by deleting the edges from a perfect matching has a b-coloring using 2 and n colors, but has no b-coloring using a number of colors between 2 and n. This motivates the definition of the b-spectrum of G, that is the set Sb(G) containing every integer k such that G has a b-coloring with k colors. A graph G is b-continous if Sb(G) = [χ(G), b(G)] ∩ Z. In [2], they prove that for each finite subset S ⊂ N − {1}, there exists a graph G such that
Sb(G)= S, and also that deciding if a graph is b-continuous is NP-complete even if colorings with χ(G) and b(G) colors are given.
Now, given a b-coloring with k colors, since each b-vertex has at least k − 1 neighbors, there exists k vertices with degree at least k − 1 (this would be a subset of k b-vertices of the k colors). So if we define m(G) as the largest positive integer k such that there exist at least k vertices with degree at least m(G) − 1 in G, we have that b(G) ≤ m(G). This upper bound was introduced in [8], where the authors show that one can find m(G) in polynomial time using the degree list of the graph. Also, they prove that if G is a tree, then b(G) ≥ m(G) − 1, and that one can decide if b(G) = m(G) in polynomial time. Their result was later generalized for graphs with girth at least 7 [6] (the girth of G is the minimum lenght of a cycle in G). We also mention that there are many results that say that regular graphs with large girth have high b-chromatic number [3,5,13,3]. Indeed, the following conjecture is still open.
Conjecture 1.1 If G is a d-regular graph with girth at least 5 and G is not the Petersen graph, then b(G)= d + 1.
Because of these results, it makes sense to investigate the b-continuity of graphs with large girth. Indeed, in [1] the authors prove that regular graphs with girth at least 6 and without cycles of length 7 are b-continuous, and in [11], they prove that every graph with girth at least 10 are b-continuous. Here, we improve their result to graphs with girth at least 8.
Theorem 1.2 If G is a graph with girth at least 8, then G is b-continuous.
In addition, we prove that graphs with girth at least 7 are, in way, almost b-continuous.
Theorem 1.3 If G is graph with girth at least 7, then [2χ(G), b(G)] ∩ Z ⊆ Sb(G).

Given a graph G and a b-coloring of G with k colors, k ≥ χ(G) + 1, the proof of Theorems 1.2 and 1.3 consists in trying to obtain a b-coloring with k − 1 colors using simple recoloring procedures; when this is not possible, we get that the graph has a special structure and apply non-constructive arguments to obtain the desired b-coloring. We mention that the coloring problem is NP-complete for graphs with
girth at least k, for every fixed k ≥ 3 [12]. This is why any proof of a result like
Theorem 1.2 is expected to have a non-constructive part. In the next section, we present the basic definitions and results, in Section 3 we present our proofs, and in Section 4, we make some further comments on the proof and state some open questions.

Preliminaries
In [1], a vertex u ∈ V (G) is called a k-iris if there exists S ⊂ N (u) such that
|S|≥ k − 1 and d(v) ≥ k − 1 for every v ∈ S (observe Figure 1).

Fig. 1. In the figure, we presente a 4-iris.

This definition is important because of the following important lemma. Observe that the lemma also implies that if G and k satisfies the conditions, then b(G) ≥ k.
Lemma 2.1 ([1]) Let G be a graph with girth at least 6 and without cycles of lengh
7. If G has a k-iris with k ≥ χ(G), then G has a b-coloring with k colors.
As we said before, given a b-coloring of G with k colors, k > χ(G) + 1, we try to obtain a b-coloring of G with k − 1 colors. However, this is not always possible, and when this happens, it is because we have a k-iris. Our theorem then follows from the lemma above. We mention that the constraint about not having cycles of length 7 appears only in the above lemma, but not on our proof. We now introduce the further needed definitions.
From now on, let G be a simple graph and ψ be a b-coloring of G with k > χ(G) + 1 colors. We say that u realizes color i if ψ(u) = i and u is a b-vertex. We also say that color i is realized by u. For x ∈ V (G) and i ∈ {1,..., k}, let Nψ,i(x) be the set of vertices of color i in the neighborhood of x, i.e., Nψ,i(x) = N (x) ∩ ψ−1(i); in fact, we omit ψ in the superscript since it is always clear from the context. This is also done in the next definitions. For a subset X ⊆ V (G), let
Ni(X) = (Sx∈X Ni(x)) \ X. Let B(ψ) denote the set of b-vertices in ψ and, for
each i ∈ {1,..., k}, let Bi = B(ψ) ∩ ψ−1(i) be the set of b-vertices in color class i.

Given a set K such that K ⊆ ψ—1(i) for some i ∈ {1,..., k}, we say that a color j ∈ {1,..., k}\ {i} is dependent on K if Ni(Bj) ⊆ K; denote by U (K) the set of colors depending on K. If K = {x}, we write simply U (x). Given x ∈ V (G) \ B(ψ), if |U (x)| ≥ 2 we call x a useful vertex; otherwise, we say that x is useless. For j ∈ {1,..., k}, we say that x ∈ V (G) is j-mutable if x is useless and there exists a color c such that we can change the color of x to c without creating any b-vertex of color j; we also say that color c is safe for (x, j). If there is no safe color for (x, j), we say that x is j-imutable.
Proofs
The next lemma is the main ingredient in our proof. Combined with Lemma 2.1, it immediatly implies Theorem 1.2.
Lemma 3.1 Let G = (V, E) be a graph with girth at least 7. If G has b-coloring with k colors where k ≥ χ(G)+ 1, then either G has a b-coloring with k − 1 colors, or G contains a (k − 1)-iris.
Proof. Our proof is similar to that made in [11], but we concentrate in one color that we want to eliminate.
Suppose that G does not have a b-coloring with k − 1 colors; we prove that
G has a (k − 1)-iris. For this, let ψ be a b-coloring with k colors that minimizes
|B1| and then minimizes |ψ—1(1)| (i.e., it firstly minimizes the number of b-vertices of color 1, then it minimizes the number of vertices of color 1). First, we prove that every x ∈ ψ—1(1) \ B1 is useful. Suppose otherwise and let x be a useless vertex in color class 1, i.e., |U (x)| ≤ 1. If U (x)= ∅, then we can recolor x without losing any b-vertex, a contradiction since ψ minimizes |ψ—1(1)|. And if U (x)= {d}, then we can obtain a b-coloring with k − 1 by recoloring x and cleaning d, again a contradiction. Therefore, the following holds:
Every x ∈ ψ—1(1) \ B1 is useful.
Now, we choose any u ∈ B1 and analyse its vicinity in order to obtain the desired (k − 1)-iris. For this, the following two claims are essential.
Claim 3.2 Let j ∈ {2,..., k}. If every x ∈ Nj(u) \ Bj is 1-mutable, then one of the following holds:
N (u) ∩ Bj /= ∅; or
There exists a color d ∈ {2,..., k}\ {j} such that d depends on Nj(u), i.e.,
Nj(Bd) ⊆ Nj(u).
Proof of claim: Suppose that neither (ii) nor (iii) holds, and let ψj be obtained from ψ by changing the color of each x ∈ Nj(u) to a color c safe for (x, 1). Because (iii) does not hold, we get that U (Nj(u)) ⊆ {1}. Therefore, at most one color loses all of its b-vertices, namely color 1, and since every x ∈ Nj(u) is 1-mutable, no b-vertices of color 1 is created. But because u is not a b-vertex in ψj (it is not adjacent to color j anymore) and ψ minimizes |B1|, we get that ψj cannot be a b-coloring, which

means that we can obtain a b-coloring with k − 1 colors by cleaning color 1.♦ The following claim tells us that (ii) or (iii) actually always hold.
Claim 3.3 (iv) Every x ∈ Nj(u) \ Bj is 1-mutable, for every j ∈ {2,..., k}.
Proof of claim: Suppose, without loss of generality, that d ∈ {2,..., k} is such that the colors in {d + 1,..., k} are exactly the colors that contains some 1-imutable vertex. We count the number of colors with b-vertices in the vicinity of u to get that in fact d ≥ k. So, for each i ∈ {d + 1,..., k}, let wi ∈ Ni(u) be a 1-imutable vertex. By definition, this means that, for each i ∈ {d + 1,..., k}, there exists some neighbor of wi that would be turned into a b-vertex of color 1 in case we change the color of wi; let vi be such a vertex. We then know that vi ∈ ψ—1(1) \ B1, which by (i) gets us that |U (vi)| ≥ 2. By the definition of U (x) and the fact that every x ∈ {vd+1,..., vk} is colored with color 1, we get:
U (vi) ∩ U (vl)= ∅, for every i, l ∈ {d + 1,..., k},i /= l.
Now, we investigate the b-vertices around colors {2,..., d}.	By Claim 3.2,
suppose, without loss of generality, that p ∈ {2,..., d} is such that (ii) holds for colors in {2,..., p}, while (iii) holds for colors in {p + 1,..., d}. For each i ∈ {p + 1,..., d}, let ci ∈ {2,..., k}\ {i} be a color depending on Ni(u), which means that Bc ⊆ N (Ni(u)). Observe that, since G has no cycles of length 3, we get:
{2,..., p}∩ {cp+1,..., cd} = ∅
Also, because G has no cycles of length 4, we get ci /= cl for every i /= l, i.e.:
|{cp+1,..., cd}| = d − p
Finally, because G has no cycles of length smaller than 6, we get that:
k

{2,..., p, cp+1,..., cd}∩ 
 

i=d+1
U (vi)= ∅.

Now, recall that ψ(vi) = 1 for every i ∈ {d + 1,..., k}, and that ci /=1 for every
i ∈ {p +1,..., d}. This means that 1 ∈/ {cp+1,..., cd}∪ Sp	U (vi). By combining
Equations (1) through (4), we get the following, which implies d ≥ k as desired:
k − 1 ≥ |{2,..., p}∪ {cp+1,..., cd}∪ U (vd+1) ∪ ... ∪ U (vk)|

= d − 1+ Σk
|U (vi)|	♦

≥ d − 1+ 2(k − d).
Now, let N = (N (u) ∪ N (N (u))) \ {u}. Observe that because (ii) or (iii) holds for every color l ∈ {2,..., k}, we get that B(ψ) ⊆ N . Suppose that N [u] does not contain a (k − 1)-iris, otherwise the proof is done. This means that at least one color in {2,..., k}, say k, is such that (ii) does not hold for k, which by Claim 3.2 implies that (iii) holds, i.e., that there exists a color in {2,...,k − 1}, say 2, such that N 2(Bk) ⊆ N 2(u) (Observe Figure 2). Now, let w ∈ N 1(Bk); it exists since the vertices in Bk are b-vertices. By (i), there exists at least two colors in {2,..., k}

that depend on w. But because B(ψ) ⊆ N , we get a cycle of length at most 6, a contradiction.

Now, to prove Theorem 1.3, we apply Lemma 3.1 and the next lemma. A star is a tree that has at most one vertex with degree bigger than 1, and the diameter of a graph G is the maximum number of edges in a shortest path of G. Here, as happens in Lemma 2.1, we get that the existence of a k-iris in G implies b(G) ≥ k.
Lemma 3.4 If a graph G has girth at least 7 and a k-iris where k ≥ 2χ(G), then
G has a b-coloring with k colors.
Proof. Let u ∈ V (G) be a k-iris with k ≥ 2χ(G). Let u2,..., uk be neighbors of u such that d(ui) ≥ k−1 for every i ∈ {2,..., k}; let Ni be a subset of k−2 neighbors of ui different from u. Start by coloring u with 1 and, for each i ∈ {2,..., k}, give color
i to ui and colors {2,..., k}\{i} to Ni. Denote by T the set {u, u2,..., uk}∪Sk	Ni,
i.e., T denotes the set of colored vertices. Observe Figure 3.

Observe that the coloring can be easily done since G[T ] −u is a forest formed by k − 1 stars. Also, note that we already have k b-vertices of distinct colors, and thus it only remains to extend the partial coloring to the rest of the graph. For this, let B be the set of vertices adjacent to some color class in {1,..., χ(G)}. We claim that

|N (w) ∩ T|≤ 1 for every w ∈ B; indeed, because T induces a tree of diameter 4, if this was not true, then we would get a cycle of length at most 6. By the definition of B, we then get that every w ∈ B has no neighbors in color classes χ(G)+1,..., k. Thus, since k ≥ 2χ(G), we can color G[B] with colors χ(G)+ 1,..., 2χ(G). Finally, by the definition of B, we know that every w ∈ V (G) \ (B ∪ T ) has no neighbors of color 1 through χ(G), which means that we can color G−T −B with these colors.2

Conclusion
We have proved that every graph with girth at least 8 is b-continuous, and that graphs with girth at least 7 are in way almost b-continuous. This improves the result presented in [11], where they prove that graphs with girth at least 10 are b-continuous. There, the authors also pose the following questions:
Question 1 What is the minimum gˆ such that G is b-continuous whenever G is a graph with girth at least gˆ?
Question 2 Are bipartite graphs with girth at least 6 b-continuous?
Recall that the graph obtained from the complete bipartite graph Kn,n by re- moving a perfect matching is not b-continuous, for every n ≥ 4 [9]. Hence, by our result we get:
5 ≤ gˆ ≤ 8.
We believe that the same techniques might improve this bound to 7, but not further. In particular, we mention that Lemma 3.1 works for graphs with girth 7 and that the bound is 8 because of Lemma 2.1. Therefore, if the following question is answered “yes”, then we get gˆ ≤ 7.
Question 3 Let G be a graph with girth at least 7 such that G has a k-iris, with
k ≥ χ(G)+ 1. Does G admit a b-coloring with k colors?
As for the case of bipartite graphs, we think it is worth mentioning a known conjecture about their b-chromatic number. Recall the upper bound m(G) for the b-chromatic number b(G), which is the maximum value k for which there exist k vertices with degree at least k − 1. The set of all vertices with degree at least m(G) − 1 is denoted by D(G), and a graph is said to be tight if |D(G)| = m(G); this means that there is only one candidate set for the b-vertices of a b-coloring of G with m(G) colors. Deciding if b(G) = m(G) is NP-complete even for bipartite
tight graphs [9]. In [7], the authors define the class Bm that contains every bipartite
graph G = (A ∪ B, E) such that m(G)= m, D(G)= A and G has girth at least 6. They conjecture the following:
Conjecture 4.1 [7] For every m ≥ 3, and every G ∈ Bm, we have that:
b(G) ≥ m(G) − 1.
We mention that, if G is a bipartite graph with girth at least 6 and a b-coloring of G with k colors is given, k ≥ χ(G)+1, then, with a little more work, one can get from the proof of Lemma 3.1 that G contains an induced subgraph H that has a structure

similar to the structure of a graph in Bk. Trying to use this structure to obtain a b- coloring of H with k − 1 colors could translate into proving Conjecture 4.1. And on the other way around, we believe that a strategy to prove Conjecture 4.1 could help coloring these graphs, which would imply that the answer to Question 2 is “yes”. This means that answering Question 2 seems as hard as proving Conjecture 4.1. We also mention that in [10], it is proved that Conjecture 4.1 is a consequence of the famous Erdos-Faber-Lova´sz Conjecture, which remains open since 1972 and which is largely believed to hold. This is strong evidence that Conjecture 4.1 holds.
Finally, because of the difficulties in obtaining b-continuity already for bipartite graphs with girth at least 6, maybe a good bet would be also to see if the lower bound for gˆ is tight. So, we propose one additional question:
Question 4 Does there exist a graph with girth 5 that is not b-continuous?
