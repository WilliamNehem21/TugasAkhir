Abstract In this paper, a new (k, n) verifiable secret image sharing scheme (VSISS) is proposed in which third order LFSR (linear-feedback shift register)-based public key cryptosystem is applied for the cheating prevention and preview before decryption. In the proposed scheme the secret image is first partitioned into several non-overlapping blocks of k pixels. Every k pixel is then used to form
m = )k/4¶+ 1 pixels of one encrypted share. The original secret image can be reconstructed by
gathering any k or more encrypted shared images. The experimental results show that the proposed VSISS is an efficient and safe method.

Introduction

With rapid growth of networking technology, digital data can be transferred easily over the Internet. But security and protec- tion of sensitive digital information during transmission is a great concern in commercial, medical and military applica- tions. Two methods cryptography [1,2] and data hiding [3] have been used to increase the security of the digital data such as images. Nevertheless, one of the common vulnerabilities of both these methods is ‘‘single point of failure’’ (SPOF) as they use single storage mechanism and therefore data can be easily misplaced or damaged. Secret image sharing schemes (SISS)

are useful options. The basic idea behind secret sharing is to transform a secret into n number of ‘‘shadows’’ or ‘‘shares’’ that can be carried and stored disjointedly. The secret can only be restored from any k shadows (k 6 n) and any (k — 1) or fewer shadows cannot reveal anything close to that secret.
The secret sharing schemes (SIS) were first introduced by Blakley [4] and Shamir [5] separately in 1979. Shamir’s secret sharing scheme is a (k, n) threshold-based secret sharing scheme. It is based on (k — 1) degree polynomial and Lagrange interpola- tion. In 2002, Thienand Lin[6] proposedan(k, n) thresholdbased secret image sharing scheme (SISS) by extending Shamir’s poly- nomial approach. In their scheme, the pixel value larger than 250 is always truncated to 250 before the generation of shares. This loss of pixel value has the truncation distortion which is the chief drawback of Thien–Lin scheme. Thien’s work attracted many researchers to suggest different techniques which are applied in the literature [7,8]. Recently, Wu [9] has smartly solved the ‘‘truncation distortion’’ problem.
Blakley’s proposed secret sharing scheme is established by using geometric approach. According to his method, the secret

is a point in a k-dimensional space and the hyper-planes in that space are defined by the n number of shadows. For sharing of secret image, Blakley’s geometric approach has been taken by Chen–Fu [10]. The probability of only containing one shared image to obtain the secret image of Chen–Fu is higher than Lin–Thien’s scheme. In 2008, Tso first quantized the secret image and then applied Blakley’s concepts to share the quan- tized image [11]. However, due to quantization errors, recon- structed image is not distortion free.
Another common drawback of all the above (k, n) threshold
elements of S can be represented by the symmetric tth power sum of the roots as follows:
St = at + at + at ;  t = 0; 1	(3)
The period of f(x) is denoted as per(f).

Lemma 1 ([13][14]). Let f(x) = x3 — ax2 + bx — 1 be a polynomial over F, a1, a2, a3 be three roots of f(x) over F, and S = {St} be the characteristic sequence generated by f(x). Let f(x)= (x — at )(x — at ) x — at .



ification, i.e. in all these schemes it is presumed that the origi- nal secret image holder known as the dealer and the participants are not cheated. However, the following two situ- ations may also arise:

The cheating by the dealer: A dealer may provide a fake share to a particular participant.
The cheating by a participant: One participant may sup- ply a fake shadow to the other participants.

In [7], the author proposed verifiable secret image sharing scheme (VSISS) in which the cheaters (a dishonest dealer or a dishonest participant) can easily be distinguished. Merely as the authors of [7] adopted Thien–Lin scheme for share gen- eration and secret reconstruction, their scheme suffers from the major drawback of Thien–Lin which has already been hashed out before. Thus to perfectly recover, Zhao employed the tech- nique of carving up a pixel whose value is larger than 250 into two which charge extra storage. In [12], Wu et al. proposed a secret sharing scheme based on cellular automata. Though Wu et al. remove the problems of truncation distortion or pixel division it does not bring out any verification to identify cheaters.
In this paper, we propose a novel (k, n) threshold verifiable secret image sharing scheme (VSISS) which generates encrypted shares. The proposed method can identify cheaters and recover the original secret without any deprivation. More- over the probability of guessing of one correct shared image of the proposed method is minimized.

Preliminaries

The 3rd order LFSR sequence

In this section we briefly present the 3rd order linear-feedback shift register (LFSR) sequence [13]. Let f(x) be an irreducible polynomial over F = GF(p), where p is a prime. Then f(x) is defined as
f(x)= x3 — ax2 + bx — 1;  a; b ∈ F	(1)
A sequence S = {St} is a third-order homogeneous LFSR sequence with a characteristic polynomial f(x) if the elements of S satisfy the following recursive relation
St = aSt—1 — bSt—2 + St—3;  t ≥ 3	(2)
where S0 = 3; S1 = a and S2 = a2 — 2b, then f(x) generates the characteristic sequence S = {St}. We represent St as St(a; b) or St(f), and S as S(a, b) or S(f).
Assume that a , a , a are all three roots of f(x) in the split-
f t (x)= x3 — St(a; b)x2 + St(a; b)x — 1; where S—t(a; b)
= St(b; a).
If f(x) is irreducible over F, then f(x) and ft(x) have the same period if and only if (per(f), t) = 1.
If (per(f), k) = 1, then f(x) is irreducible over F if and only if ft(x) is irreducible over F.


Theorem 1 ([13]). Let f(x) = x3 — ax2 + bx — 1 be a polyno- mial over F, and let S be the characteristic sequence generated by
f(x). Then for all positive integers t and e,
St(Se(a; b); S—e(a; b)) = Ste(a; b)= Se(St(a; b); S—t(a; b))   (4)
The theorem 1 has been proved in [13]. This theorem guaran- tees the commutative property. If we consider a and b as vari- ables in F and t as a fixed integer, then St(a, b) and S—t(a, b) are Waring polynomials.
Fact 1 ([13,14]): For a fixed positive integer t, if gcd(t, pi — 1) = 1, i = 1, 2, 3, then for any u, v ∈ F, the following sys- tem of equations has a unique solution (a, b) ∈ F · F.
St(a; b)= u and S—t(a; b) = v	(5)
Otherwise, St(a, b) and St(a, b) are orthogonal in F in variables
a and b.

Lemma 2 ([14]). Let f(x) = x3 — ax2 + bx — 1 be an irre- ducible polynomial over F of the period Q = p2 + p + 1 and S= {St} be the characteristic sequence generated by f(x). Let t and t' be different coset leaders modulo Q, and both t and t' are relatively prime to Q. Then
(St; S—t) – (St' ;	S—t' )	(6)

Lemma 2 provides a one-to-one correspondence between the private key space and the public key space. Fact 1 together with Lemma 2 can be used to construct a public key encryption scheme, which is described in next section.

The LFSR-based public key cryptography

In this section, we introduce the LFSR-based public key cryp- tography by the 3rd order characteristic sequences. We apply the following steps to select the public and private keys:

Choose two secret prime number p and q.
Calculates N = p · q.
Calculate the period U of the irreducible polynomial as
U = (p2 + p + 1)(q2 + q + 1).
Choose a random integer e with gcd(e, pi — 1) = 1 for

ting field of f(x) over F. According to Newton’s formula, the

Decryption: The plaintext P = (P1, P2) can be generated from the given the cipher text C = (C1, C2) as P1 = Sf(C1, C2) and P2 = S—f (C1, C2).

Proposed secret image sharing scheme (SISS)

In this section we propose a verifiable (k, n) secret image shar- ing scheme based on the 3rd order LFSR-based public key cryptosystem [13] for verification. Our proposed verifiable secret image sharing scheme (VSISS) consists of three phases: Initialization phase, share generation and reconstruction. Sec- tion 3.1 presents initialization phase, Section 3.2 presents the proposed share generation scheme and Section 3.3 introduces the verification and recovery strategy.

Initialization phase

Dealer (original secret holder) D first selects two prime number p and q to calculate N = p · q and two positive integers a and b to obtain an irreducible polynomial f(x) over F = GF(p),

Divide the Secret Image into T number of non-over- lapping blocks {Bt}T  of 1 · k pixels, where T = M×N.
Set t to 1.
Select an appropriate hash function and compute Mi = H (T i) for each participant Ai. Mi is also divided into k non-overlapping blocks of length k bits in such a way that k × k ≤ |Mi| (|·| represents the length).
Each jth (1 6 j 6 k) block is converted into k bits number aj, where aj ∈ {0; 1; ... ; (2k — 1)}.
Create an equation based on k consecutive pixels
{R1, R2,.. ., Rk} of block Bt (generated in step 6) as
k
st =	rjRj  where rj = aj + 1	(8)
j=1
St is converted into r = (8 + 2k) bits number as
br—1.. .b1b0.
Compute x = (8m — r). If r „ 8m, then go to step 13. Otherwise i.e. if r = 8m, then go to step 14.
Generate a random number of length x bits as b'  to ' and add this x bits sequence in MSB position of br—1.. .b1b0. Thus an 8m bits number b' ... b' br—1 ... b1b0 i.e. b8m—1b8m—2.. .b1b0 is obtained.
Obtain m gray (8 bits) pixels from 8m bit sequence (generated in step 12).
pi = b7	...	b1b0 pi = b15	...	b9b8

where f(x) = x3 — ax2 + bx — 1. Then dealer publishes N, a
and b.

On the other hand, each participant Ai
(1 6 i 6 n) also
i = b8m—1  ...  b8m—7b8m—8

selects a random number ei from the interval [2, N] as its own secret shadow where gcd (ei; pr — 1) = 1 for r = 2, 3. Then each participant Ai computes (Sei (a; b); S—ei (a; b)) and provides it to the dealer. Ai also provides its identity number IDi to the dealer and publishes {IDi; sei (a; b)}. For any two participants Ai and Aj, the dealer has to ensure that (Sei (a; b); S—ei (a; b)) – (Sej (a; b); S—ej (a; b)) and IDi „ IDj. The dealer then generates n shares each of size m×M×N where m is
defined as
m = )k/4¶+ 1	(7)

Share construction phase

The share construction phase generates n encrypted shadow images of size m×M×N from a secret image I of size M · N
Sequentially assign pi ; pi ; ... ; pi to the ith shadow.
Increase t by 1.
Repeat steps 7 through 16 until t > T.
Increase i by 1.
Repeat step 5 through 18 until i > n.
End.


The verification and recovery phase

This section introduces a scheme to reconstruct the original secret image from k or more shared images. The members of A = {A1, A2,.. ., An} will recover the secret image. If any k number of participants verify each other and gathers their shares, then the original secret will be reconstructed. The steps

4(a), 5(a) and Figs. 1(b), 2(b), 3(b), 4(b), 5(b) are the recon- structed image respectively. Both of the set of ({1(a), 2(a), 3(a), 4(a), 5(a)} and ({1(b), 2(b), 3(b), 4(b), 5(b)}) images are indistinguishable. Figs. 1–5(c)–(h) show the noisy share images of size 256 · 128.

Analysis of correlation coefficient

The correlation coefficient rxy between a pair of random vari- ables (x, y) can be calculated by the following formula:

experimentation are given in Table 2. The SSIM values of

In our experiment (x, y) pair chosen as one pair of adjacent
pixels in vertical, horizontal and diagonal directions. To com- pute the correlation coefficients of pairs of adjacent pixels, we choose 2048 random pairs of neighboring pixels in all three directions from the secret image and encrypted shared images. The correlation coefficients of two adjacent pixels in Fig. 1 in all three directions are listed in Table 1 and compared with the results in Refs. [2,12]. With regard to obtained results listed in Table 1 it is clear that the pixels in the encrypted shares of the proposed method are in feeble correlations, then the encryp- tion result is quite serious.

Analysis of structural similarity index metric (SSIM)

To check how dissimilar the encrypted shares from each other, we have used another well-known quality metric know as the Structural Similarity Index Metric (SSIM). It was developed
of the security of the proposed method.

Cheating prevention

Each participant can easily prevent cheating before secret image reconstruction by verifying that if another participant provides correct or faulty data. Theorem 2 analyzes the verifi- cation capability of the proposed scheme. Hence the proposed method has the power to preclude cheating. On the other hand, the scheme [6,8–12] does not support verification thus cannot prevent cheating. The length of the key (private/public) used in cheating prevention is shorter in comparison with Zhao et al.’s [7] scheme for same for the same degree of protection.

Theorem 2. Anyone can verify by another participant Ai by computing Sf T' = Se (a; b).

pixel intensities that have been normalized for luminance dis- tortion and contrast distortion. The values of the SSIM index are ranging from 0 to 1. A value of 0 shows two images (origi- nal and encrypted) are all dissimilar and 1 means the reverse
one. If two images are X and Y, the SSIM is defined as:

Proof. In Section 3.3 if a participant Ai provides true T' = Se (Se (a; b); S—e (a; b)), then anyone can check whether T' is a cheater as

anti-cheating property and thus a verifiable scheme.

Computation overhead

The proposed scheme uses an LFSR-based public key crypto- system for cheating prevention. The LFSR is a one-way func- tion which has lower computation cost than exponentiation

Security of the proposed scheme

The security of the proposed scheme is employed according to the 3rd order LFSR-based public key cryptosystem. This sec- tion presents the resistance capability of the proposed scheme against the attacks such as brute-force attack and collusion attack:

A new (k, n) verifiable secret image sharing scheme	207


























Figure 5	(a) Secret image (Couple), (b) reconstructed image, (c)–(h): four shadow images.



Brute-force attack: As there are totally 256 possible values for each Pi and at least k shares are required to reconstruct the secret image, attackers have to guess at least k number
of  Pi  values,  which  has  P(256; k) = 256 × 255 × ··· ×
(256 — k + 1) possible values. Now for all T number of blocks of the secret image, the probability to reconstruct the original

secret  is	1  T =	1
M×N .  This  probability  is  really

depressed; yet less than the probability of Li et al.’s [17] scheme. Thus the proposed scheme is completely secure scheme that could protect the original secret against the brute force attack in a high probability.

208	A. Nag et al.











Collusion attack [18]: The proposed scheme can easily resist collusion attack as at the beginning each of the participants has to pass the verification phase (step 2 of Section 3.3). Even if two participants Ai and Aj plan to recover the original secret image by exchanging their Sei and Sej values, their conspiracy
will be identified as each of participants Ai have provided their
unique identity number IDi to the dealer and published
{IDi, sei (a, b)}. This type conspiracy can easily be detected by other participants. Thus proposed scheme is robust against collusion attack.

Merit of the proposed scheme

To further assess the performance of the proposed scheme, comparisons among the proposed scheme and the other related schemes [6–11] are listed in Table 3. The virtues of the pro- posed scheme are drawn as follows:

Probability of guessing: For a secret image of size (M × N ), there are N×N blocks as secret image is decomposed into blocks of size k pixels. In the recovery phase, to obtain k pixels, which are the coefficients of Eq. (11), at least k equa- tions are required. If a malicious user gathers (k — 1) sha- dow images, he/she can create only (k — 1) equations. The possibility of exact solution is then only  1 . Hence, for
M 
Our proposed verifiable secret image sharing approach has the following properties:

The proposed scheme can produce the highly confidential encrypted shadows.
The generated shadow images are smaller in size with respect to the secret image.
The secret image can be perfectly reconstructed from any k
different shadows.
The original secret image cannot be reconstructed when any (k — 1) fewer shadows are gathered.
Each shadow is verifiable by others and thus no secure channel is required.
The proposed scheme can easily resist brute force attack and collusion attack.

The theoretical analysis and experimental results show that our proposed approach gives the above excellent properties.

Conclusion

Secret image sharing is an effective scheme which provides confidentiality and integrity of the sensitive image. In this paper a novel verifiable secret image sharing scheme based on the (k, n) threshold and 3rd order LFSR-based public key
cryptosystem is proposed. This new VSISS generates meaning-

Extra storage and distortion free recovery: To avoid the truncation distortion and lossless recovery, the schemes [6,7] divide one pixel into two and used extra storage to storage than new pixel. On the other hand, the proposed scheme and the schemes [9,10] can recover the original secret image losslessly without extra storage. Though the scheme [8] does not use any extra storage, but recovery is not lossless.
Shadow size: The shadows of our scheme are little larger than the schemes [6–9] but smaller (for k > 3) than Chen- Fu’s scheme [10].
more, the proposed system can reconstruct the original secret without any loss and for that it does not load any additional memory. Experimental results and analyses indicate the strength and efficiency of the proposed scheme.
