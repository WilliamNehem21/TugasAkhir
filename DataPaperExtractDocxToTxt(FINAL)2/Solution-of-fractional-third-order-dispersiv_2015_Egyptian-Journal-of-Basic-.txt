In this paper, we proposed fractional differential transform method(FDTM) and modified fractional differential transform method(MFDTM) for the solution of fractional third-order dispersive partial differential equations in one- and higher-dimensional spaces. The plotted graphs illustrate the behavior of the solution for different values of fractional ordera. The efficiency and accurateness of the proposed methods are examined by means of four numerical experiments.

1.	Introduction

In recent past, the glorious developments have been envis- aged in the field of fractional calculus and fractional differ- ential equations. Differential equations involving fractional order derivatives are used to model a variety of systems, of which the important applications lie in field of viscoelasticity, electrode-electrolyte polarization, heat conduction, electro- magnetic waves, diffusion equation and so on [1,2]. Due to its tremendous scope and applications in several disciplines, a considerable attention has been given to exact and numerical solutions of fractional differential equations. A great deal of
researchers has shown the advantageous use of the fractional calculus in the modeling and control of many dynamical systems [3e10]. Other than modeling aspects of these differ- ential equations, the solution techniques and their reliability are rather more important aspects. It is also equally important to handle critical points which cause sudden divergence convergence and bifurcation of the solutions of the model. In order to achieve the goal of highly accurate and reliable so- lutions, several methods have been proposed to solve the fractional order differential equations. Some of the recent analytical/numerical methods are Adomian decomposition method (ADM) [11e16], finite difference method [17], Varia- tional iteration method (VIM) [18,19], Operational matrix

The main aim of this work is to apply FDTM and MFDTM to

solve third-order dispersive partial differential equations [28e32]. The DTM obtains an analytical solution in the form of

(x — t)m—a—1fm(t)dt for m — 1 < a < m,

a polynomial. It is different from the traditional high order Taylor's series method, which requires symbolic competition of the necessary derivatives of the data functions. The Taylor series method is computationally taken long time for large orders. With this method, it is possible to obtain highly ac-
curate results or exact solutions for differential equations. The use of DTM in electric circuit analysis was pioneered by Zhou [33]. Since then, DTM was successfully applied for large vari- ety of problems such as partial differential equations [34,35],
solitary wave solutions for the KdV and mKdV equations [36],
m2N, x > 0, f 2Cn .


The unknown function f = f(x,t) is assumed to be a casual function of fractional derivatives (i.e., vanishing for a<0) taken
in Caputo sense as follows.

the literature. The main drawback of the ADM is to calculate

Adomian polynomials for a nonlinear operator where the procedure is very complex. The difficulty in VIM has an inherent inaccuracy in identifying the Lagrange multiplier, correctional functional and stationary conditions for the fractional order. The disadvantage of the Homotopy pertur- bation method is to solve functional equation in each itera- tion, which is sometimes complicated and unattainable. Therefore, the proposed FDTM and MFDTM are much easier
3.	Two-dimensional fractional differential
transform method

Consider a function of two variables u(x,t) and suppose that it can be represented as a product of two single variable func-
tions i.e., u(x,t)=f(x)g(t). Based on the properties of two-
dimensional fractional differential transform, the function
u(x,t) can be represented as

when compared with ADM, VIM and HPM. The outline of this	∞  ∞

paper is as follows. In section 2 the basic definitions of frac- tional calculus are discussed. The basic definitions of two- dimensional FDTM and MFDTM are presented in section three and four. Four clear cut test problems of fractional third- order dispersive partial differential equations are given to elucidate the proposed methods in section 5. At the end, we

Modified fractional differential transform method

However, there are difficulties in FDTM while handling the non-linear functions in two-dimension. Let us consider the differential transform for

(4) involves four summations. Thus it is necessary to have a lot
of computational work to calculate such differential trans- form Ua,1(k,h) for the large number of (k, h). As we know that, FDTM is based on the Taylor series for all variables. To avoid these difficulties, MFDTM is considered the Taylor's series of
the functionu(x,t) with respect to the specific variable. Assume

Conclusions



Ua,1(x, y, z, 0) = 0	(40)
Following the same procedure in Example 1 and 2, we ob-
tained the FDTM and MFDTM series solution
In this paper, we implemented the two-dimensional FDTM and MFDTM for solving fractional third-order dispersive par- tial differential equation. DTM is an attractive tool for solving linear and nonlinear partial differential equations and it does

not require linearization, discretization or perturbation. But it also faces some difficulties while constructing recursive equation for the function of three or more variables and it requires an expensive computational cost to solve the alge- braic recursive equation. The proposed MFDTM for the spe- cific variable can obtain the simple recursive equation. Thus it is concluded that MFDTM enhances the effectiveness of the computational work when compared with the FDTM. The proposed methods are simpler in its principles and effective in solving linear and nonlinear differential equations of frac- tional order and promising tool for solving wider class of nonlinear fractional models in mathematical physics with high accuracy.
