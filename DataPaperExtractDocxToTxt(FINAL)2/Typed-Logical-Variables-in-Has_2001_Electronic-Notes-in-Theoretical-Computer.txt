Typed Logical Variables in Haskell

Claessen Koen and Peter Ljunglo¨f

Abstract
We describe how to embed a simple typed functional logic programming language in Haskell. The embedding is a natural extension of the Prolog embedding by Seres and Spivey [16]. To get full static typing we need to use the Haskell extensions of quantified types and the ST-monad.
