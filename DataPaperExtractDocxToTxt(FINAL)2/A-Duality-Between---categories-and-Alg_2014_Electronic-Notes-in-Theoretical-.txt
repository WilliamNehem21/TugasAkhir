Abstract
In this paper, we propose a definition of algebraic Ω-categories. Let Ω-POID denote the category of Ω-categories with Ω-functors between them such that inverse image of ideals are also ideals, and let Ω- AlgDomG denote the category of algebraic Ω-categories with Scott continuous functors between them having left Ω-adjoints. We show that Ω-AlgDomG and Ω-POID are dual equivalent to each other.
Keywords: Duality, (Algebraic) Ω-category, Ω-adjunction, Ideals.


Introduction
The Stone duality and Stone representation come from the classical Stone represen- tation of Boolean algebras [19], and lead to locale theory as ‘pointless topology’ [2]. Abramsky related the important application of Stone duality in Theoretical Com- puter Science, particularly in Domain Theory of denotational semantics of computer programming languages [1]. It provides the right framework for understanding the relationship between denotational semantics and program logic. Study of dualities between categories of certain domains were originated by Hofmann, Mislove and

Stralka [7] and Lawson [13]. Therein, there are two basic dualities in domain the- ory: the first is the duality between the category of posets and the category of algebraic domains, many other dualities can be induced by this one; the second one is the duality between the category of domains (i.e., continuous dcpos) and the category of completely distributive lattices.
Quantitative Domain Theory, which models concurrent systems, forms a new branch of Domain Theory, and has undergone active research in the past three decades. Rutten’s generalized (ultra)metric spaces [17], Flagg’s continuity spaces [6] and Wagner’s Ω-categories [24] are examples of quantitative domain theory frame- works. Therein, the Ω-category approach has been payed more and more attentions, including Waszkiewicz [25], Hofmann and Waszkiewicz [8] and Lai and Zhang [12]. And a kind of Lawson duality in framework of Ω-categories has been studied by Hofmann and Waszkiewicz [9].
Ω-categories are interesting objects for mathematicians and theoretical computer scientists. Firstly, Ω-categories are a special kind of enriched categories, so they can be studied as categories. In 1973, Lawvere [14] observed that the theory of Ω- categories unifies preordered sets (Ω = {0, 1}, the two point lattice), generalized metric spaces (Ω = [0, ∞)op), and many other mathematical structures into one framework. Secondly, due to the adjunction a ∗ b ≤ c ⇔ b ≤ a → c in the quantale Ω, if we interpret the complete lattice as a set of truth values, the operators ∗ and → can be interpreted as the logic connectives conjunction and implication respectively. Therefore, the theory of Ω-categories has a many-valued logic flavor [17]. This feature also leads to the point that Ω-categories can be regarded as generalized preordered sets, or Ω-valued preordered sets. For instance, we can interpret the A(a, b) as the degree to which a is smaller than or equal to b, that is, the connection between two points is measured by an element in Ω. Thirdly, Ω-categories are closely related to topology. This can be roughly explained as follows. Generalized metric spaces and many-valued preordered sets are special kinds of Ω-categories, and conversely general Ω-categories can also be studied as Ω-valued quasi-metric spaces or many-valued preordered sets.
The aim of this paper is to study the first duality mentioned in the first para- graph in framework of Ω-categories, that is the duality between the category of Ω-categories and of algebraic Ω-categories. This paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we recall some basic materials related to Ω-category theory and some preparations are made; in Section 3, we firstly give a definition of an algebraic Ω- categories and then establish a duality between the category of Ω-categories and the category of algebraic Ω-categories.

Preliminaries and preparations
We refer to [15] for general category theory, to [10] for enriched category theory, to
[16] for quantales, and to [12] for Ω-categories.
A commutative quantale is a pair (Ω, ∗), where Ω is a complete lattice and ∗
is a commutative, associative, and monotone operation ∗ :Ω × Ω −→ Ω such that

p ∗ (−) has a right adjoint for every p ∈ Ω. The right adjoint of p ∗ (−) is denoted p → (−). A commutative quantale is called unital if ∗ has a unit I, i.e. p ∗ I = p for every p ∈ Ω. It should be noted that the unit I need not be the greatest element of Ω. Throughout this paper, (Ω, ∗,I), or just Ω, will always denote a commutative, unital quantale if not otherwise specified.
Proposition 2.1 Suppose that (Ω, ∗,I) is a commutative unital quantale, then (I1) p ∗ Wi qi = Wi(p ∗ qi).
(I2) I ≤ p → q ⇔ p ≤ q;
(I3) I → p = p;
(I4) (p → q) ∗ (q → r) ≤ p → q;
(I5) (Wi pi) → q = Vi(pi → q);
(I6) p → (Vi qi)= Vi(p → qi);
(I7) (r → p) → (r → q) ≥ p → q;
(I8) (p → r) → (q → r) ≥ q → p;
(I9) p → (q → r)= (p ∗ q) → r.
Categorically speaking, a commutative unital quantale (Ω, ∗,I) is just a sym- metric, monoidal closed category with the underlying category being a complete lattice. Therefore, we can develop a theory of categories enriched over Ω [10,14].
A category enriched over Ω [14], or an Ω-category, is a set A together with an assignment of an element A(a, b) ∈ Ω to every ordered pair of (a, b) ∈ A × A, such that
I ≤ A(a, a) for every a ∈ A;
A(a, b) ∗ A(b, c) ≤ A(a, c) for all a, b, c ∈ A.
For all a, b ∈ Ω, let Ω(a, b)= a → b. Then (Ω, →) becomes an Ω-category [14]. The L-preordered sets [3] for L a complete residuated lattice, the generalized metric space [14,23] and the V-continuity space in [5,6] are special cases of Ω-categories.
Suppose that A is an Ω-category. Let Aop(a, b)= A(b, a) for all a, b ∈ A. Then Aop is also an Ω-category, called the opposite of A. If B is a subset of A, let B(x, y) = A(x, y) for all x, y ∈ B. Then B becomes an Ω-category, called a (full) subcategory of A. An Ω-functor between Ω-categories A and B is a map f : A −→ B such that A(a, b) ≤ B(f (a),f (b)) for all a, b ∈ A. An Ω-functor f ∈ [Aop, Ω] (resp., f ∈ [A, Ω]) is always called a lower set (resp., an upper set) in A.
Given two Ω-categories A and B, denote the set of all the Ω-functors from A

to B by [A, B]. For all f, g ∈ [A, B], let [A, B](f, g) = V
x∈A
B(f (x), g(x)). Then

[A, B] becomes an Ω-category, called the functor category from A to B [10]. All
Ω-categories and Ω-functors form an ordinary category, denoted by Ω-Cat.
For an ordinary set X, ΩX the set of all maps from X to Ω, the members are called Ω-sets of X. The family ΩX is also an Ω-category, which is the same to [X, Ω]

by regarding X as a discrete Ω-category. That is to say, ΩX (f, g) = V
x∈X
f (x) →

g(x) (∀f, g ∈ ΩX )
Definition 2.2 A pair of Ω-functors f ∈ [A, B],g ∈ [B, A] is said to be an Ω-

adjunction, in symbols f E g : A ~ B, if B(f (a), b)= A(a, g(b)) for all a ∈ A, b ∈
B. In this case, we say f is a left Ω-adjoint of g and g is a right Ω-adjoint of f . Sometimes we also say that (f, g) is an Ω-adjunction between A and B.
Theorem 2.3 [12] Suppose f : A −→ B and g : B −→ A are two maps (need not be Ω-functors) between Ω-categories. Then the following conditions are equivalent:
(f, g) is an Ω-adjunction.
For all a ∈ A, b ∈ B, A(a, g(b)) = B(f (a), b).
f and g are functors and I ≤ A(a, gf (a)),I ≤ B(fg(b), b) (∀a ∈ A, b ∈ B).
Example 2.4 A fundamental example of Ω-adjunctions are that induced by Kan extension. Let f : A −→ B be an Ω-functor. For each ψ ∈ [B, Ω], define f→(ψ)= ψ ◦ f . Then we obtain a functor f→ : [B, Ω] −→ [A, Ω], which has a left Ω-adjoint

f→ : [A, Ω] −→ [B, Ω] given by f→(φ)(y)= W
x∈A
φ(x) ∗ B(f (x), y) (∀y ∈ B) for each

φ ∈ [A, Ω]. That is f→ E f→ : [A, Ω] ~ [B, Ω] is an Ω-adjunction. Since if f : A −→
B is an Ω-functor then so is f : Aop −→ Bop, we have f→ E f→ : [Aop, Ω] ~ [Bop, Ω] is an Ω-adjunction.

Let A be an Ω-category. For φ ∈ ΩA, define y(φ)(x)= W
a∈A
A(x, a) ∗ φ(a) (∀x ∈

For x ∈ A, by y(x) we mean the Ω-set y(Ix), where Ix is the Ω-set sending x
to the unit I and others to 0. In fact, y(x)(y)= A(y, x) for any x, y ∈ A.
Definition 2.5 ([12,26]) In an Ω-category A, an Ω-set φ of A is called a directed set in A if

W
x∈A
φ(x) ≥ I;

∀x, y ∈ A, φ(x) ∗ φ(y) ≤ W
z∈A
φ(z) ∗ A(x, z) ∗ A(y, z).

A directed set is called an ideal if it is a lower set additionally. The set of all ideals
in A is denoted by I(A), then I(A) is a subcategory of [Aop, Ω]. Clearly, for each
x ∈ A, y(x) ∈ I(A).
Proposition 2.6 (1) For any x ∈ A, J ∈ I(A), I(A)(y(x),J )= J (x).
(2) Let f : A −→ B be an Ω-functor, then f→(J ) ∈ I(A) for any J ∈ I(B).
Proof. Straightforward.	2
Lemma 2.7 For φ ∈ ΩA, we have
for any ψ ∈ ΩA, ΩA(φ, ψ) ∗ φ ≤ ψ.
for any x, y ∈ A, A(x, y) ∗ ΩA(φ, y(x)) ≤ ΩA(φ, y(y)).
y(φ) is the smallest lower set which is larger than or equal to φ under point- wise order in ΩA;
if φ is directed then y(φ) is an ideal;
for an Ω-functor f ∈ [A, B], if φ is directed set in A then f→(φ) ∈ I(B).
Proof. (1), (2) and (3) are straightforward.
Suppose that φ is directed. Then

W
x∈A
y(φ)(x) ≥ W
x∈A
φ(x) ≥ I.

For any x, y ∈ A,
y(φ)(x) ∗ y(φ)(y) =	W
a,b∈A
≤	W


A(x, a) ∗ φ(a) ∗ A(y, b) ∗ φ(b)
φ(c) ∗ A(a, c) ∗ A(b, c) ∗ A(x, a) ∗ A(y, b)

a,b,c∈A
≤ W φ(c) ∗ A(x, c) ∗ A(y, c)
c∈A

≤ W W
φ(c) ∗ A(z, c) ∗ A(x, z) ∗ A(y, z)

c∈A z∈A
= W ( W φ(c) ∗ A(z, c)) ∗ A(x, z) ∗ A(y, z)
z∈A c∈A

= W
z∈A
y(φ)(z) ∗ A(x, z) ∗ A(y, z).

Then y(φ) is directed.
By Proposition 5.3 in [26], we know that f→(φ) is directed, and by (4),
f→(φ)= y(f→(φ)) is an ideal.	2
Let A be an Ω-category. An element b ∈ A is called a colimit [10] of a functor f ∈

[K, A] weighted by φ ∈ [Kop, Ω] if for each y ∈ A, A(b, y)= V
k∈K
φ(k) → A(f (k), y).

Weighted colimits, when they exist, are unique up to isomorphism. It is written by
b = colimφf if b is a colimit of f weighted by φ.
Consider an Ω-category A as an Ω-preordered set, an element b ∈ A is called

a join of φ : A —→ Ω, in symbols b = Hφ, if A(b, x) = V
y∈A
φ(y) → A(y, x) for any

x ∈ A. In fact, if φ is a lower set in A, then Hφ = colimφid, where id : A —→ A is
the identical functor (cf. Example 3.2(4) and Proposition 3.3(2) in [12]).
Proposition 2.8 In an Ω-category A, for φ ∈ ΩA, if Hφ exists then so does Hy(φ)
and Hφ = Hy(φ).
Proof. Suppose that a = Hφ, we only need to show that for any x ∈ A,

V
y∈A
y(φ)(y) → A(y, x) = V
y∈A
φ(y) → A(y, x). In fact, V
y∈A
y(φ)(y) → A(y, x) =

V V (φ(z) ∗ A(y, z)) → A(y, x) =	V φ(z) →	V (A(y, z) → A(y, x)) =

y∈A z∈A
z∈A
y∈A

V
y∈A
φ(y) → A(y, x).	2

Proposition 2.9 [4,10,12,20] If f : A —→ B has a right Ω-adjoint, that is f is a left Ω-adjunction. Then f preserves the existing joins, that is f (Hφ)= Hf→(φ).
Proof. Easily following from Theorem 3.11 in [12] and Proposition 2.9 above. See also Theorem 4.5 in [26].	2
By a class of weights [2,10,11] is meant a functor Φ : Ω-Cat —→ Ω-Cat such that (1) for every Ω-category A, Φ(A) ⊆ [Aop, Ω]; (2) Φ(A) contains the image

of the Yoneda embedding y : A —→ [Aop, Ω]; (3) Φ(f ) = f→ for every Ω-functor f : A —→ B. The class of weights P given by P(A) = [Aop, Ω] is the largest class of weights. The class of weights Y given by Y(A)= {y(a)| a ∈ A} is the smallest class of weights. The correspondence I : A —→ I(A) is a class of weights (Lemma 5.3 in [12]).
Let Φ be a class of weights. An Ω-category is call Φ-cocomplete if for any φ ∈ Φ(K) and any functor f ∈ [K, A], colimφf always exists. Let Φ be a class of wights. A functor f ∈ [A, B] between Φ-cocomplete Ω-categories is called Φ- cocontinuous if it preserves colimits weights in Φ, that is colimφg = colimφ(fg) for all φ ∈ Φ(K) and g ∈ [K, A].
Proposition 2.10 [2,12] An Ω-category A is Φ-cocomplete iff Hφ exists for any φ ∈ Φ(A). A functor f ∈ [A, B] is Φ-cocontinuous iff f (Hφ) = Hf→(φ) for any φ ∈ Φ(A).
Proof. This proposition can be implied by using Proposition 3.5, Corollary 3.5 and Corollary 4.6 in [12].	2
Corollary 2.11 An Ω-category A is I-cocomplete iff HI exists for any I ∈ I(A). A functor f ∈ [A, B] is I-cocontinuous iff f (HI)= Hf→(I) for any I ∈ I(A).
An I-cocontinuous functor is called Scott continuous in some papers, e.g. [26], it is a counterpart of a Scott continuous map in domain theory.
Algebraic Ω-category and its dual to Ω-category
Let L be an I-cocomplete Ω-category. Define w : L × L —→ Ω by

w(a, b)=	 
J∈£(L)
L(b, HJ ) → J (a) (∀a, b ∈ L).

We call w the way below relation on L (which is denoted by ⇓ in [26]). For x ∈ L, if w(x, x) ≥ I, then we call x a compact element in L and denote by K(L) the set of all compact elements in L.
Let L be an I-cocomplete Ω-category and x ∈ L. Define a map kx : L —→ Ω by kx = y(x)|K(L), y(x) restricted on K(L), that is kx(y) = e(y, x) if y ∈ K(L) and otherwise 0. If kx is directed in L (or equivalently, kx ∈ I(K(L))) and x = Hkx for any x ∈ L, then we call L an algebraic Ω-category. The algebraic Ω-category of a generalization of the algebraic fuzzy dcpos in [26] for Ω a complete residuated lattice and that in [22] for Ω a complete Heyting algebra.
The aim of this section is to establish a duality between the following two cate- gories:
The one is Ω-POID: objects are Ω-categories, morphisms are maps between them such that inverse image of ideals are still ideals (maps like that the one f : A —→ B between Ω-categories such that f→(I) ∈ I(A) for all I ∈ I(B), it is routine to show that such a map is automatically an Ω-functor).

The other is Ω-AlgDomG: objects are algebraic Ω-categories, morphisms are Scott continuous maps between them which having left Ω-adjoints.
The duality between Ω-POID and Ω-AlgDomG will show the reasonableness of the definition of algebraicness of Ω-categories.



A functor Ω-POID from to Ω-AlgDomop


Proposition 3.1 For any Ω-category A, I(A) is I-cocomplete as a full subcategory of [Aop, Ω].


Proof. Suppose that Φ ∈ I(I(A)). We will show that HΦ=	W

Step 1. φ ∈ I(A). In fact,
φ is a lower set. For any x, y ∈ A,


φ(x) → φ(y) ≥	 
J∈£(A)
(Φ(J )∗J (x)) → (Φ(J )∗J (y)) ≥

Corollary 3.2 Suppose that Φ ∈ I(I(A)).	Then for any x ∈ A, (HΦ)(x) = Φ(y(x)).
Proof. By Proposition 3.1,


(HΦ)(x)=	 
J∈£(A)

Φ(J ) ∗ J (x)=	 
J∈£(A)

Φ(J ) ∗ I(A)(y(x),J ) ≤ Φ(y(x))


since Φ is a lower set. For the other direction,


(HΦ)(x)=	 
J∈£(A)

Φ(J ) ∗ J (x) ≥ Φ(y(x)) ∗ y(x)(x) ≥ Φ(y(x)).

Proposition 3.3 In the I-cocomplete Ω-category I(A), for any J ∈ I(A), we have

w(J, J )=   J (x) ∗ I(A)(J, y(x)).
x∈A

It follows that for each x ∈ X, y(x) is a compact element in I(A).
Proof. By the definition of way below relation w, for any J ∈ I(A),


w(J, J )=	 
Φ∈£(£(A))
I(A)(J, HΦ) → Φ(J ).

On the one hand, for any x ∈ A, Φ ∈ I(I(A)), we have
J (x) ∗ I(A)(J, HΦ) ∗ I(A)(J, y(x))
≤ I(A)(J, y(x)) ∗ J (x) ∗ (J (x) → (HΦ)(x))
≤ I(A)(J, y(x)) ∗ (HΦ)(x)
= I(A)(J, y(x)) ∗ Φ(y(x))
≤ Φ(J ).
This shows that J (x) ∗ I(A)(J, y(x)) ≤ I(A)(J, HΦ) → Φ(J ). By the arbitrariness

of x ∈ A and Φ, we have w(J, J ) ≥ W
x∈A
J (x) ∗ I(A)(J, y(x)).

On the other hand, define
ΦJ (φ)=   J (x) ∗ I(A)(φ, y(x)) (∀φ ∈ I(A)).
x∈A

If ΦJ ∈ I(I(A)) and J = HΦJ , then w(J, J ) ≤ ΦJ (J )= W
x∈A
J (x) ∗ I(A)(J, y(x)).

In fact, (i) for any φ1, φ2 ∈ I(A),
ΦJ (φ1) → ΦJ (φ2) ≥   (J (x) ∗ I(A)(φ1, y(x))) → (J (x) ∗ I(A)(φ2, y(x)))
x∈A

≥   I(A)(φ1, y(x)) → I(A)(φ2, y(x)) ≥ I(A)(φ2, φ1).

Then ΦJ is a lower set.

In (iii), the fact that I(A)(—, y(z)) = y(y(z)) is an ideal in I(A) for any z ∈ A is used.

By (i)-(iii), ΦJ is an ideal in I(A).
It is easy to show that	W

Proposition 3.4 For any J ∈ I(A), kJ is directed and HkJ = J. Thus I(A) is an algebraic Ω-category.

Theorem 3.5 Suppose that f : A —→ B is a morphism in Ω-FPOID. Deﬁne Id(f )= f→|£(B) : I(B) —→ I(A) by Id(f )(J )= f→(J ) (∀J ∈ I(B)). Then Id(f ) is a morphism in Ω-AlgDomG.
Proof. Id(f ) : I(B) —→ I(A) is a map since f→(J ) ∈ I(A) for any J ∈ I(B). Since f→ ~ f→ : [Aop, Ω] —→ [Bop, Ω] is an Ω-adjunction, by Proposition 2.10, f→ : [Bop, Ω] —→ [Aop, Ω] preserves arbitrary joins and then Id(f ) = f→|£(B) : I(B) —→ I(A) preserves joins of ideals and so is Scott continuous.
Define g : I(A) —→ I(B) by g(Jj)= f→(Jj) (∀Jj ∈ I(A)), that is g = f→|£(A).
By Lemma 2.5(5), g is a map and for any Jj ∈ I(A), J ∈ I(B),
I(B)(g(Jj),J )= [Bop, Ω](f→(Jj),J )  = I(A)(Jj,f→(J )) = I(A)(Jj, Id(f )(J )).
Thus (g, Id(f )) is an Ω-adjunction by Theorem 2.3.	2
Proposition 3.4 and Theorem 3.5 show that Id:Ω-POID—→ Ω-AlgDomop is a functor which transfers Id(A)= I(A) for any Ω-category A and Id(f )= f→|£(B) : I(B) —→ I(A) for any Ω-functor f ∈ [A, B].

A functor from Ω-AlgDomG to Ω-POIDop
For any algebraic Ω-category L, K(L) is an Ω-category as a full subcategory of L.
Lemma 3.6 Suppose that g : L —→ M is a Scott continuous functor between two algebraic Ω-categories which has a left Ω-adjoint gE : M —→ L. Then gE(K(M )) ⊆ K(L).
Proof. For any a ∈ K(M ), we need to show gE(a) ∈ K(L), that is L(gE(a), HJ ) ≤
J (gE(a)) for all J ∈ I(L). In fact,
L(gE(a), HJ )= M (a, g(HJ )) = M (a, Hg→(J )) ≤ g→(J )(a)

=   J (b) ∗ L(a, g(b)) =   J (b) ∗ M (gE(a), b) ≤ J (gE(a)).

Lemma 3.7 For J ∈ I(K(L)), consider J as an Ω-set of L, we have y(J ) ∈ I(L), where

thus y(x)|K(L) is a lower set in K(L).
For any a1, a2 ∈ K(L),

Theorem 3.9 K : Ω-AlgDomG —→ Ω-POIDop (L '→ K(L), g '→ gE) is a func- tor.
Proof. Suppose that g : L —→ M is a morphism in Ω-AlgDomG, we need to show that gE : K(M ) —→ K(L) is a morphism in Ω-POID. Suppose that J ∈ I(K(L)), by Lemma 2.7(4), y(J ) ∈ I(L), by Proposition 2.8, HJ = Hy(J ).
Put c = HJ , then we have J (a) = y(c)(a) for all a ∈ K(L) and then J = y(c)|K(L). In fact, J (a) ≤ L(a, c) = y(c)(a) since c = HJ . Conversely, since a ∈ K(L), we have
I ≤ w(a, a) ≤ L(a, Hy(J )) → y(J )(a)= L(a, c) → y(J )(a)

and

y(c)(a)= L(a, c) ≤ y(J )(a)=	 
x∈K(L)

J (x) ∗ L(a, x) ≤ J (a)

since J is a lower set in K(L).
We will show that (gE)→(J )= y(g(c))|K(M ). For any b ∈ L(M ), (gE)→(J )(b)= J (gE(b)) = y(c)(gE(b)) = L(gE(b), c)= M (b, g(c)) = y(g(c))(b).
Hence (gE)→(J ) ∈ I(K(M )) by Proposition 3.8.	2
By the proof of Theorem 3.9, we have
Proposition 3.10 For any algebraic Ω-category L, all ideals in K(L) has the form
y(x)|K(L) for some x ∈ L.
Proof. Let id : L —→ L be the identical functor. Then the left Ω-adjoint of id is still id, thus for any ideal J in K(L), J = id→(J )= y(x)|K(L), where x is the join of J in L.	2
Duality between Ω-AlgDomG and Ω-POID
For any Ω-category A, define ηA : A —→ K(I(A)), x '→ y(x) (∀x ∈ X).

Proof. For f : A —→ B a morphism in Ω-POID, Id(f ) = f→|£(B) : I(B) —→
I(A). By Theorem 3.5, the left Ω-adjoint of Id(f ) is K◦Id(f )= f→|£(A) : I(A) —→ I(B).
We need to show that f→ ◦ ηA = ηB ◦ f . In fact for any x ∈ A, for any y ∈ B,
f→(ηA(x))(y)= f→(y(x))(y)=    y(x)(a)∗Bop(f (a), y)=    B(y, f (a))∗A(a, x).

on the other hand,
  B(y, f (a)) ∗ A(a, x) ≥ B(y, f (x)) ∗ A(x, x) ≥ ηB(f (x)(y).
a∈A

Hence f→(ηA(x))(y)= ηB(f (x)(y). Therefore f→ ◦ ηA = ηB ◦ f .	2
Proposition 3.12 Deﬁne a transformation ε : Id ◦ K —→ idΩ-AlgDomG by for any L ∈ Ω-AlgDomG, εL : I(K(L)) —→ L, J '→ HJ (∀J ∈ I(K(L)). Then ε is a natural isomorphism. The inverse of ε of given by ε−1(x)= y(x)|K(L).
Proof. ε(ε−1(x)) = H(y(x)|K(L)) = Hkx = x and ε−1(ε(J )) = ε−1(HJ ) =
y(HJ )|K(L) = J .	2
By Propositions 3.11 and 3.12,
Theorem 3.13 Id is the left adjoint of K.
In order to show the isomorphism between Id and K, we need two additional conditions for the quantale Ω:
(Q1) I ≤ W A implies I ≤ x for some x ∈ A ⊆ Ω;
(Q2) I ≤ x ∗ y implies I ≤ x or I ≤ y for any x, y ∈ Ω.
The following example gives such a quantale which is nontrivial, ∗ /= ∧ and
I /= 1.
Example 3.14 Let Ω = {0, a, b, 1} be the diamond lattice, that is 0 ≤ a, b ≤ 1 and
a /≤ b, b /≤ a. Define ∗ :Ω × Ω —→ Ω by

Clearly, ∗ is monotone and a is the unit and the conditions (Q1) and (Q2) are satisfied. We now only need to show that x∗(a∨b)= (x∗a)∨(x∗b) or x∗1= x∨(x∗b) for any x ∈ Ω. In fact, if x = 0 or x = a, then it holds; if x = 1, it holds since 1 ∗ 1= 1; if x = b, then x∗ 1= b = b∨b = x∨ (x∗b). Then (Ω, ∗, a) is a commutative unital quantale (furhtermore, ∗ is idempotent).
Proposition 3.15 If (Q1) and (Q2) hold for Ω, then the compact elements in I(A)
have the form y(x) (x ∈ A). In this case, Ω-AlgDomG is dual to Ω-POID.
Proof. Let A be an Ω-category. Suppose that φ is a compact element in I(A),

by Proposition 3.3, we have W
x∈A
I(A)(φ, y(x)) ∗ I(A)(y(x), φ) ≥ I. By (Q1), we

have I(A)(φ, y(x)) ∗ I(A)(y(x), φ) ≥ I for some x ∈ A. By (Q2) I(A)(φ, y(x)) ≥
I, I(A)(y(x), φ) ≥ I, which implies φ = y(x).	2
4	Conclusions
By introducing a definition of algebraicity of Ω-categories, we show that the category of algebraic Ω-categories (with certain morphisms) and the category of Ω-functors

(with certain morphisms) are dual equivalent to each other. The transformation from an Ω-category to an algebraic Ω-category exactly is the ideal completion (i.e., I-completion), and the that from an algebraic Q-category to an Ω-category just is the restriction to the compact objects of an algebraic Ω-category.
Such a duality could be generalized to one between Ω-categories and Φ-algebraic Ω-categories for Φ is a (saturated) class of weights. For Φ being I, an I-algebraic Ω- category just is an algebraic Ω-category in this paper. For Φ is the maximal class P, a P-algebraic Ω-category just is a totally algebraic cocomplete Q-categories in [21]. There are also many interesting examples of other classes of weights in framework of metric spaces studied in [18].
