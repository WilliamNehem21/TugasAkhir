Abstract
We prove computable versions of the Implicit Function Theorem in the single and multivariable cases. We use Type Two Effectivity as our foundation.
Keywords: Computable Analysis, Computability.


Introduction
The Implicit Function Theorem guarantees, under certain conditions, the ex- istence of unique local continuous functional solutions to equations of the form
φ(x, y)= 0
given an initial condition of the form
y(a)= b.
Under a surprisingly weak assumption, namely the differentiability of φ, the differentiability of the solution is also guaranteed. A very simple application of this, encountered by most single-variable Calculus students when they learn to use implicit differentiation to calculate tangent lines to curves (although they are not aware of the statement of the Implicit Function Theorem as it requires notation from multivariable calculus), is given by the equation

and the initial condition

Once granted the assumption that there is a differentiable functional solution

to (3) that satisfies (4) on an open interval containing √2 , one can verify
through direct calculation that the derivative of the solution satisfies
y' =	x. y
Then, using the initial condition, we can determine that y'(  1 )= −1.
The Implicit Function Theorem also has important applications to dif- ferential equations, numerical analysis, and geometric analysis. A thorough discussion of the Implicit Function Theorem, its many variations, and its ap- plications may be found in [2].
Here we state and prove a computable version of the Implicit Function The- orem in its single variable case, which is what we have just broadly described, and in its multivariable case. We use Type Two Effectivity theory as devel- oped in Weihrauch [5] as our foundation. The reasoning for the multivariable case builds on that for the single-variable case. Hence, even though the multi- variable case implies the single-variable case, we present both arguments. Our goal is to show that, in general terms, if φ, a, and b are computable, then the unique continuous functional solution to (1) that satisfies (2) is computable. In addition, we show that if φ has a computable derivative, then this solution has a computable derivative. We also prove uniform versions of these results. Unless otherwise mentioned, all computability notation is as in Soare [4]. Unless otherwise mentioned, all computable analysis notation is as in
Weihrauch [5].
We define a few notations and helpful conventions. First, we write f : A	B if dom(f )	A and ran(f )	B. If f is a function and X is a set, then
f [X] =df {y | ∃x ∈ dom(f ) ∩ X f (x)= y}.
We note that X is not required to be a subset of the domain of f . Unless otherwise mentioned, the following conventions are followed for sake of brevity.
A computable real number is a ρ-computable real number.
A point a ∈ Rn is computable if and only if it is ρn-computable.
A function φ :⊆ Rn → Rm is computable if it is (ρn, ρm)-computable.
A finite interval is computable if its endpoints are computable. An interval of the form (−∞, a), (−∞, a], (a, ∞), or [a, ∞) is computable if a is

computable.
C(U ) is the set of all continuous functions from U into U .
A function F :⊆ C(U ) → R is computable if it is (δU , ρ)-computable. That is, if there is a computable function H :⊆ Σω → Σω such that
F ◦ δU = ρ ◦ H.
A function F :⊆ C(U ) × R → R is computable if it is (δU , ρ, ρ)- computable. That is, if there is a computable function H :⊆ Σω → Σω such that F ◦ [δU , ρ]= ρ ◦ H.
A function F :⊆ R → C(U ) is computable if it is (ρ, δU )-computable.

Single-variable case
Theorem 2.1 (Single-Variable Implicit Function Theorem) Suppose
E ⊆ R2 is open.	Suppose φ : E → R and ∂φ are continuous.	Suppose
φ(a, b)= 0 and ∂φ(a, b) /= 0. Then, there exist open intervals U, V with a ∈ U and b ∈ V such that there exists a unique f : U → V such that φ(x, f (x)) = 0 for all x ∈ U and f (a)= b. Furthermore, f is continuous.
We prove the following computable version of this theorem.
Theorem 2.2 (Computable Single-Variable Implicit Function Theo- rem) Suppose E ⊆ R2 is open. Suppose φ : E → R is computable and ∂φ is continuous. Suppose a, b  R are computable, φ(a, b) = 0, and ∂φ(a, b) is a non-zero computable number. Then, there exist computable open intervals
U, V  R with a  U and b  V such that there exists a unique f : U  V such that φ(x, f (x)) = 0 for all x  U and f (a) = b. Furthermore, f is computable.
We give two proofs of Theorem 2.2. The first is a simple, non-uniform proof.

First proof of Theorem 2.2 Let U , V , and f be as given by Theorem 2.1. Let V ' be an open interval such that V '  V , b  V ', and the endpoints of V ' are rational. By the continuity of f , there is an open interval U ' such that U ' U , a  U ', the endpoints of U ' are rational, and f [U ']  V '. Let g be the restriction of f to U '. It follows that for each x  U ', g(x) is the unique number in V ' such that φ(x, g(x)) = 0. It now follows from Corollary 6.3.5 of
[5] that g is computable.	 
Our second proof of Theorem 2.2 is uniform. It uses a computable version of the Contraction Mapping Theorem which we state and prove below. We

will need the following definition, which is essentially that given in [1]. Here, and throughout this paper, d denotes the Euclidean distance function.
Definition 2.3 Suppose f :⊆ Rn → Rm and k ∈ R. We say that k is a contraction constant for f if 0 < k < 1 and d(f (x),f (y)) ≤ kd(x, y) for all x, y ∈ dom(f ).
The following is well-known.
Theorem 2.4 (Contraction Mapping Theorem) If U is a closed interval and f ∈ C(U ) has a contraction constant, then f has a unique ﬁxed point.
Theorem 2.5 (Uniformly Computable Contraction Mapping Theo- rem) Suppose U		R is a closed interval.	There is a computable Ψ : C(U )	(0, 1)	U such that for all (f, k)		C(U )	(0, 1), if k is a con- traction constant for f, then (f, k)	dom(Ψ) and Ψ(f, k) is a ﬁxed point for f.
Proof. Fix a rational number p0 ∈ U . For all f ∈ C(U ) and k ∈ (0, 1), let


Ψ(f, k) = lim
m→∞
fm(p0).

If k is a contraction constant for f , then Ψ(f, k) is defined and is a fixed point for f . It remains to show that Ψ is computable.
For all f ∈ C(U ), let
S(f )= (p0,f (p0),f 2(p0),.. .).
It follows from Theorem 3.1.7.2 of [5] that S is (δU , [ρ]ω) computable. For all
f ∈ C(U ), k ∈ (0, 1), and n ∈ N, let e(f, k, n) be the least number m such that
m
0 	0
≤	.
1 − k	2n
It follows that e is (δU , ρ, νN, νN )-computable.
Suppose f ∈ C(U ), and suppose k ∈ (0, 1) is a contraction constant for f .
For all m, let pm = fm(p0). It follows that for all m ∈ N
|pm − pm+1|≤ km|p0 − p1|.
It now follows that when n > m,
|pm − pn|≤ |pm − pm+1| + |pm+1 − pm+2| + ... + |pn−1 − pn|
≤ km|p0 − p1| + km+1|p0 − p1| + ... + kn−1|p0 − p1|

km
≤ |p0 − p1| 1	k.
It now follows from Theorem 4.3.7 of [5] that Ψ is computable.	 
Second proof of Theorem 2.2 We follow the proof in [3]. Define
φ(x, y) F (x, y)= y − ∂φ (a, b) .

Thus, F : E → R2 is computable, ∂F (a, b) = 0, and φ(x, y) = 0 if and only if
F (x, y)= y. Also, ∂F is continuous.
There is a rational r > 0 such that	∂F	< 1 on the open disk in R2
centered at (a, b) and with radius r. Fix√a rational number k in (0, r). Fix
a rational number h such that 0 < h <	r2 − k2 and |F (x, b) − b| < k/2 if
|x − a| < h. Define U to be (a − h, a + h) and V to be (b − k, b + k).
Fix x ∈ U . We first note that if |y − b| ≤ k, then d((x, y), (a, b)) < r. The key claim is that if y, y' ∈ V , then |F (x, y) − F (x, y')| ≤ 1 |y − y'|. For, suppose y, y' are distinct elements of V . By the Mean Value Theorem, there is a number y'' between y and y' such that
F (x, y)	F (x, y')= ∂F (x, y'')(y	y').
∂y
The claim then follows from the previously imposed bound on ∂F . We note that we do not need a computable version of the Mean Value Theorem to establish this claim.
We now note that F (x, ·): V → V is a contraction map with contraction
constant 1. By Lemma 6.1.7 of [5], the representations δU and [ρ → ρ]U are
computably equivalent. Since F is computable, it follows from Theorem 2.3.13
of [5] that the map x '→ F (x, ·) is computable. Let Ψ be as in Theorem 2.5. Define f (x)= Ψ(F (x, ·), 1). It follows from Theorem 2.5 that f is computable. Hence, f is continuous. The uniqueness of f follows from the uniqueness clause of Theorem 2.4.	 
Theorem 2.6 In Theorem 2.2, if φ is differentiable, and if φ' is computable, then U, V can be chosen so that f ' is computable.
Proof. In the proof of Theorem 2.2, choose r so that ∂φ > 0 on the open disk in R2 with center (a, b) and radius r. Let B be this disk.
Let x0,x be distinct elements of U . Then, (x0,f (x0)), (x, f (x))	U	V
B. By the multivariable version of the Mean Value Theorem, there is a point

z on the line segment between (x0,f (x0)) and (x, f (x)) such that
φ(x0,f (x0)) − φ(x, f (x)) = φ'(z) · (x0 − x, f (x0) − f (x)).
(Again, we are not using, nor do we need, a computable version of this theo- rem.) Since φ(x0,f (x0)) = φ(x, f (x)) = 0, it follows that
− ∂x (z) = f (x0) − f (x) .

∂φ(z)
x0 − x

As x approaches x0, z approaches (x0,f (x0)). Since φ' is computable, ∂φ and

∂φ are computable. It then follows that ∂φ
and ∂φ
are continuous. It then

follows that
f '(x )= − ∂x (x0,f (x0)) .

0	∂φ(x ,f (x ))
∂y	0	0
Since ∂φ, ∂φ, and f are computable, it follows that f ' is computable.	 
∂x  ∂y
We now state uniform versions of these results. We will need the following definitions.
Definition 2.7 Let n, m ≥ 1.
Cn,m is the set of all functions φ :	Rn	Rm such that dom(φ) is open and φ is continuous.
C1	is the set of all functions φ :⊆ Rn → Rm such that dom(φ) is open
and φ' is continuous.
The following is a straightforward modification of the naming system for
C1(Rn) in [6].
Definition 2.8 Let n, m ≥ 1. Let a, b, r1, r2 ∈ Q, and suppose r1, r2 > 0.

Ra,r1,b,r2 is the set of all functions φ	Cn,m such that φ[B(a, r1)] B(b, r2).
Fix i, j such that 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n. We define Ri,j	to be the set of all
∂φj
functions φ ∈ C1	such that	[B(a, r1)] ⊆ B(b, r2).
We define σn,m to be {Ra,r1 ,b,r2 | a, b, r1, r2 ∈ Q ∧ r1, r2 > 0}.
We define σ1	to be
{Ra,r1,b,r2  ∩ Cn,m | a, b, r1, r2 ∈ Q ∧ r1, r2 > 0}
∪ {Ra,r1 ,b,r2 | a, b, r1, r2 ∈ Q ∧ i, j ∈ {1,..., n} ∧ r1, r2 > 0}.

Let νn,m be a standard notation of σn,m.
Let ν1	be a standard notation of σ1	.
δn,m is the representation of Cn,m given by νn,m.

δ1
is the representation of C1
given by ν1	.

Thus, the δ1	name of a function φ ∈ C1	provides the information to
compute φ as well as φ'.
Theorem 2.9 (Non-Differentiable Uniformly Computable Single- Variable Implicit Function Theorem) There is a (δ2,1, δ2,1, ρ2, ρ2, δ1,1)- computable function Ψ :⊆ C2,1 × C2,1 × R2 → R2 × C1,1 such that if φ ∈ C2,1,
φ(a, b) = 0, ∂φ is continuous, and ∂φ(a, b) /= 0, then (φ, ∂φ, a, b) ∈ dom(Ψ).
Furthermore, if (r1, r2,f )= Ψ(φ, ∂φ, a, b), then f is the unique function such that f : (a−r1, r+r1) → (b−r2, b+r2), φ(x, f (x)) = 0 for all x ∈ (a−r1, a+r1),
f (a)= b
Proof sketch Most of the work has been done in the proof of Theorem 2.2. In the proof of Theorem 2.2, use the information provided by the δ2,1 name of
∂φ to find r, h, k. In Theorem 2.5, the function Ψ can be obtained uniformly from the interval U . The proof of Theorem 2.6 shows that we can compute a δ1,1 name of f from a δ2,1 name of φ.	 
Theorem 2.10 (Differentiable  Uniformly  Computable   Single-
Variable  Implicit  Function  Theorem) There is a (δ1 , ρ2, ρ2, δ1 )-
computable function Ψ :⊆ C1 × R	→ R × C1,1 such that if φ ∈ C1 ,
φ(a, b)	=	0, and ∂φ(a, b)	/=	0, then (φ, a, b)	∈	dom(Ψ).	Further-
more, if (r1, r2,f ) = Ψ(φ, a, b), then f is the unique function such that
f : (a − r1,r + r1) → (b − r2,b + r2), φ(x, f (x)) = 0 for all x ∈ (a − r1,a + r1), f (a)= b
Proof sketch Most of the work has already been done. The only addition is

that the proof of Theorem 2.6 shows we can compute a δ1
name of f from a

1
1,1
name of φ once we have first computed a δ1,1 name of f .	 

The multivariable case
If A is a square matrix, then det(A) denotes the determinant of A.
Theorem 3.1 (Multivariable Implicit Function Theorem) Let a ∈ Rm, and let b ∈ R . Let E ⊆ R   be an open set that contains (a, b). Let φ : E → R be continuous. Suppose the following hold.
φ(a, b)= →0.

For all i, j ∈ {1,... , n},  ∂φi 
is continuous on E.

det  ∂φi  (a, b) 


i,j=1,...,n
/= 0.

Then, there exist open U ⊆ Rm and V ⊆ Rn such that a ∈ U, b ∈ V , and there is a unique continuous function f : U → V such that φ(x, f (x)) = →0 for all x ∈ U.
Definition 3.2 An open or closed ball B  Rn is computable if its center and radius are computable.
When B is an open or closed ball in Rn, let C(B) denote the set of all continuous functions from B into B. A function Ψ : C(B) (0, 1) B is computable if it is (δB , ρ, ρn)-computable.
Theorem 3.3 (Uniformly Computable Multivariable Contraction Mapping Theorem) Let B be a closed ball in Rn. There is a computable Ψ : C(B) (0, 1)  B such that for all (f, k) C(B) (0, 1), if k is a contraction constant for f, then Ψ(f, k) is a ﬁxed point for f.
The proof is basically identical to the proof of Theorem 2.5.
Theorem 3.4 (Computable Multivariable Implicit Function Theo- rem) Let a  Rm, and let b  Rn be computable. Let E  Rm+n be an open set that contains (a, b). Let φ : E  Rn be computable. Suppose the following hold.
φ(a, b)= →0.

For all i, j ∈ {1,... , n},  ∂φi 
is continuous on E.

det  ∂φi  (a, b) 
{1,... , n}.


i,j=1,...,n
/= 0, and ∂xm+j (a, b) is computable for all i, j ∈

Then, there exist computable open U ⊆ Rm and V ⊆ Rn such that a ∈ U, b ∈ V , and there is a unique function f : U → V such that φ(x, f (x)) = →0 for all x ∈ U and f (a)= b. Furthermore, f is computable.
As with Theorem 2.2, we can give a simple non-uniform proof of Theorem
3.4. We show later that the proof below is uniform.
Proof. Let yj denote xm+j. Let
D =  ∂φi (a, b)	.

∂yj
i,j=1,...,n

Let (ci,j)i,j=1,...,n = C = D−1. For each i ∈ {i,... , n}, let

n
Fi(x, y)= yi −	ci,kφk(x, y).
k=1
Let F = (F1,... , Fn). It follows that F is continuously differentiable on E. Since the entries in D are computable, it follows from Proposition 6 of [7] that C is computable. Hence, F is computable. Also, φ(x, y) = →0 if and only if F (x, y)= y. By direct calculation, we have:
∂Fi (a, b)= 1 − Σn	c	d

∂yi
∂Fi (a, b)= −Σn
k=1

c
i,k

d
k,i

if i /= j

∂yj
k=1
i,k
k,j

Since CD = In, it follows that ∂Fi (a, b) = 0 for all i, j ∈ {1,..., n}.
For each r > 0, let Br be the open ball with center (a, b) and radius r.
Choose a rational number r > 0 so that Br ⊆ E and the following hold.
For all i, j ∈ {1,..., n}, ∂Fi <  1  on Br.
det  ∂φi	is non-zero on Br.
Now, choose a rational number k such th√at 0 <  k < r.	Finally, choose
a rational number h such that 0 < h <	r2 − k2 and d(F (x, b), b) < k/2
whenever x	Rn and d(x, a) < h. Let U be the open ball in Rm with center
a and radius h. Let V be the open ball in Rn with center b and radius k.
Clearly, U, V are computable. If (x, y) ∈ U × V , then
d((x, y), (a, b))2 = d(x, a)2 + d(y, b)2

≤ h + r − h = r .

Hence, U × V ⊆ Br.
We now claim that d(F (x, y),F (x, y')) ≤ 1 d(y, y') whenever (x, y), (x, y') ∈ U × V . For, let (x, y), (x, y) ∈ U × V . Without loss of generality, suppose y /= y'. Fix i ∈ {1,..., n}. By the multivariable version of the Mean Value Theorem, there is a point y0 on the line segment between y and y such that


F (x, y) − F (x, y')= ∂Fi (x, y )(y − y' )+ ... + ∂Fi (x, y )(y
— y' ).

0	1
i	i	∂y1	1
∂yn
0	n	n

Hence,
|F (x, y) − F (x, y')|≤ ∂Fi (x, y ) |y − y' | + ... + ∂Fi (x, y ) |y


— y' |

0	1
i	i	 ∂y1	1
 ∂yn
0	n	n

≤  1 (|y − y' | + ... + |y
— y' |)

≤  n d(y, y')=  1 d(y, y').
It now follows that d(F (x, y),F (x, y')) ≤ 1 d(y, y').  In addition, by taking
y' = b, it also follows that
d(F (x, y), b) ≤ d(F (x, y),F (x, b)) + d(F (x, b), b)
1	k
< d(y, b)+ 
2	2
	≤ k.
Hence, for each x ∈ U , F (x, ·): V → V , and F (x, ·) has a contraction constant
of 1. Let Ψ be as in Theorem 3.3. Let f (x)= Ψ(F (x, ·), 1). It follows that f
is computable and φ(x, f (x)) = 0 for all x ∈ U .	 
We now discuss differentiability.
Theorem 3.5 If in Theorem 3.4 we assume φ is differentiable on E and that φ' is computable, then we may conclude that f is differentiable and f ' is computable.
Proof. Let r, U , V , etc. be as in the proof of Theorem 3.4.
There are two parts to this proof. The first is to show that f is differen- tiable. The second is to show that f ' is computable. The first part is not the main concern here and in any case is well-established. A thorough proof may be found in [3]. So, we give the second part only.

To show that f ' is computable, it suffices to show that  ∂fi
j
is computable

for all i ∈ {1,... , n} and j ∈ {1,..., m}. Fix j ∈ {1,... , m}. For each x ∈ U
g(x)= (x, f (x)).
Now, fix i ∈ {1,..., n}. We note that φi ◦ g = 0. If we apply the chain rule to φi ◦ g for the purpose of calculating its partial derivative with respect to xj, we obtain
∂(φi ◦ g) = (φ' ◦ g) ·  ∂g .

∂xj
i	∂xj

(We note that we are not applying, nor do we need, a computable version of the multivariable chain rule.) We have,

 ∂g
=  0,... , 1,... , 0, ∂f1 ,... , ∂fn 

∂xj
∂xj
∂xj

where the 1 appears in the j-th position. We also have
φ' =  ∂φi ,... ,  ∂φi , ∂φi ,... , ∂φi  .

i	∂x1
∂xm
∂y1
∂yn

By combining these results, we obtain
0= ∂φi ◦ g = ∂φi ◦ g +  ∂φi ◦ g  ∂f1 + ...  ∂φi ◦ g  ∂f1 .

∂xj
∂xj
∂y1
∂xj
∂yn
∂xj

We now allow i to vary, but keep j fixed. For each x ∈ U , let
A (x)=  ∂φi (g(x))	,

∂yk
i,k=1,...,n



and let
⎛ − ∂φ1 (g(x)) ⎞


Bj(x)= ⎜
⎜
∂xj
.
.	⎟ .
.	⎟

⎝ − ∂φn (g(x)) ⎠
It now follows that for each x ∈ U ,  ∂f (x)=  ∂f1 (x),... , ∂fn (x)  is a solution
to the system of linear equations in the n variables ω1,... , ωn given by
⎛ ω1 ⎞

.
Aj(x) ·	.
⎜ .
⎟ = Bj(x).
⎟
⎟

⎝ ωn ⎠

However, by the choice of r, det(Aj(x)) /= 0 for all x ∈ U . Hence,  ∂f (x) is

the unique solution to this system. It now follows from Proposition 6 of [7]

that  ∂f
j
is computable for each j ∈ {1,..., m}. Hence, f ' is computable.	 

We now discuss uniformity.
Theorem 3.6 (Non-Differentiable	Uniformly		Computable Multivariable	Implicit	Function		Theorem)	There	is	a

(δm+n,n
, (δm+n,n
)n2 , ρm, ρn, ρ2,δ

m+n,n
)n2 ×

Rm × Rn	→	R × R  × Cm,n  such that if φ	∈	Cm+n,n,  a	∈	Rm,
b ∈ Rn, φ(a, b) = 0,	∂φi	is continuous for all i, j ∈ {1,... , n}, and

det  ∂φi  (a, b) 


i,j=1,...,n
/= 0, then (φ,  ∂φi  


i,j=1,...,n
, a, b) ∈ dom(Ψ).

Furthermore, if (r1, r2,f ) = Ψ(φ,  ∂φi  


i,j=1,...,n
, a, b), then f is the unique

function such that f : B(a, r1)	B(b, r2), φ(x, f (x)) = →0 for all x	B(a, r1), and f (a)= b.
Proof sketch In the proof of Theorem 3.4, r, h, k can be computed from the

δm+n,n names of  ∂φi 
m j
for i, j ∈ {1 ... , n}. In Theorem 3.3, the function Ψ

can be obtained uniformly from the ball B. The proof of Theorem 3.4 shows
that we can compute a δm,n name of f from a δm+n,n name of φ and the δm+n,n
names of  ∂φi  for i, j ∈ {1 ... , n}.	 

Theorem 3.7 (Differentiable	Uniformly	Computable	Multivari-
able Implicit Function Theorem) There is a (δ1	, ρm, ρn, ρ2, δ1	)-
computable Ψ :⊆ C1	× R  × R  → R × R × C	such that if φ ∈ C1	,
m,n

a ∈ Rm, b ∈ Rn, φ(a, b) = 0, and det  ∂φi  (a, b) 

i,j=1,...,n
/= 0, then

(φ, a, b) ∈ dom(Ψ).	Furthermore, if (r1, r2,f ) = Ψ(φ, a, b), then f is the
unique function such that f : B(a, r1) → B(b, r2), φ(x, f (x)) = →0 for all
x ∈ B(a, r1), and f (a)= b.
Proof sketch Most of the work has already been done. The proof of Theorem

3.5 shows that we can compute a δ1
name of f from a δ1
name of φ

once we have computed a δm,n name of f .
