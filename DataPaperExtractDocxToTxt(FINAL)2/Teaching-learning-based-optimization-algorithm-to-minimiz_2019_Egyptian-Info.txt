Image thresholding is one of the most important approaches for image segmentation. Among multilevel thresholding techniques, cross entropy has been widely used by researchers to find multilevel threshold values. In multilevel cross entropy thresholding techniques, main target is to find an optimal combination of threshold values at different levels for minimizing the cross entropy. In this paper, Teaching-Learning- based Optimization (TLBO) algorithm is used to find an optimal combination of threshold values at dif- ferent levels for minimizing the cross entropy. TLBO algorithm is inspired by passing on knowledge within a classroom environment where students first gain knowledge from a teacher and then through mutual interaction. This new proposed approach is called the TLBO-based minimum cross entropy thresholding (TLBO-based MCET) algorithm. The performance of the proposed algorithm is tested on a number of standard test images. For comparative analysis, the results of TLBO-based MCET algorithm are compared with the results of Firefly-based minimum cross entropy thresholding (FF-based MCET), Honey Bee Mating Optimization-based minimum cross entropy thresholding (HBMO-based MCET) and Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization-based minimum cross entropy thresholding (Quantam PSO- based MCET). Comparative analysis is done based on two most popular objective performance measures, Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Uniformity. From experimental results, it is observed that the pro- posed method is an efficient and feasible method to search an optimal combination of threshold values at 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th levels.

tation is to partitioning an image into regions which are meaning- ful for a particular task. Segmentation is generally the essential component of pattern recognition systems in which objects of interest are found and isolated from the rest of the scene. After image segmentation, some features are extracted from objects and at the end, objects are classified in particular groups or classes based on extracted features. For medical applications, segmenta- tion is used for the detection of organs such as the brain, heart, lungs or liver in CT or MR images [1]. It is also used to distinguish pathological tissue such as a tumor from normal tissue. Depending on the particular application, different techniques for image seg- mentation have been used, such as image thresholding, edge detec- tion, region growing, stochastic models, ANN and clustering techniques [2]. Thresholding is one of the most frequently used methods in image segmentation because it is computationally sim- ple and never fails to define disjoint regions with closed, connected boundaries [3]. Its basic idea is to divide the image into target and background regions by the threshold value. Intensity value of each

pixel of the image is compared to the threshold value. If its value is greater than the threshold value, then the pixel is considered as target region pixel and set to white; otherwise the pixel is consid- ered as background region pixel and set to black. The success of thresholding depends upon the selection of an optimal threshold value. Over the years, various thresholding techniques have been proposed by researchers to select a suitable threshold value [4]. In the past years, many thresholding techniques using entropy measures have been proposed by researchers to select an appropri- ate threshold value for segmenting images [5–9]. In these tech- niques, first, two probability distributions, one for the target and the other for the background are obtained from gray level values of input image. After this, the procedure is adopted for maximizing the total entropy of two probability distributions to obtain the threshold. Different definitions of entropies differentiated these techniques from each other. Liu et al. [10] proposed a fuzzy classi- fication approach for image thresholding. Cheng et al. [11] used fuzzy c-partition entropy approach to select threshold. In this approach, parameterized fuzzy membership functions are used to classify pixels of image into target and background. This approach is based on the selection of an optimal combination of parameters of fuzzy membership functions for maximizing the entropy of fuzzy 2-partition. After this, the selected optimal parameters are used to find optimal threshold. Benabdelkader & Boulemden [12] proposed a recursive approach to search a suitable combination of parameters of fuzzy membership functions. In this approach, trapezium fuzzy membership function with two parameters is used. In 2011, Tang et al. [13] also proposed a recursive program- ming approach to find a suitable combination of fuzzy membership function parameters. This recursive approach is applied on two fuzzy membership functions (s-function and z-function) with three parameters. Tao et al. [14] applied ant colony optimization to search a combination of parameters of fuzzy membership func- tions for maximizing the entropy of fuzzy 2-partition. Li and Lee
[15] proposed minimum cross entropy approach for image seg- mentation. In 2011, Nie et al. [16] proposed a thresholding method that is based on two-dimensional cross entropy. In this method, gray level co-occurrence matrix is used to obtain two- dimensional cross entropy. Horng [17] proposed honey bee mating optimization algorithm for calculating the minimum cross entropy objective function. Tang et al. [18] used genetic algorithm to reduce computation burden for computing the minimum cross entropy objective function. Horng and Liou [19] proposed firefly algorithm to search multilevel thresholds by using cross entropy principal. Recently, fuzzy entropy based techniques have been pro- posed by numerous researchers to find optimal threshold. These techniques are frequently used for thresholding because it is the general belief that fuzziness and uncertainty exist in images. Although the cross entropy has been applied by many researchers to search multilevel thresholds for image segmentation, it is worth noting that selection of an optimal combination of thresholds for minimizing the cross entropy of fuzzy 2-partition in reasonable amount of time is a challenging task. Thus, selection of an optimal combination of thresholds for minimizing the cross entropy can be formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem. Over the last decade, various metaheuristic algorithms have been used by researchers to solve combinatorial optimization problems. Such algorithms are Genetic Algorithm (GA) [18,20–22], Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm [14,23], Biogeography based Opti- mization (BBO) approach [24,25], bacterial foraging optimization algorithm [26,27], gravitational search algorithm [28], cuckoo opti- mization algorithm [29], hybrid approaches [30,31], etc. Teaching- Learning-Based Optimization (TLBO) algorithm is a newly intro- duced member in the optimal algorithm family [32,33]. It is inspired by the philosophy of teaching and learning. The search mechanism of TLBO algorithm is a population-based. Initially, a
set of some feasible solution candidates of the given problem is randomly generated called the population. After this, feasible solu- tions are modified to achieve optimal solution by the simulation of a classical school learning process. This process consists of two phases: teaching phase and student phase [34]. Teacher phase sim- ulates the learning of the students through the teacher. During this phase, the best feasible solution acts as teacher. Other feasible solutions are improved by moving their positions towards the position of the teacher by taking into account the current mean value of the feasible solutions. Student phase simulates the learn- ing of the students through their mutual interaction. During this phase, two feasible solutions are randomly selected. If the first one is better than second one, then the first one is moved towards the second one. Otherwise, the first one is moved away from the second one. Main advantage of TLBO algorithm over other opti- mization algorithms is that it used only common controlling parameters while it is free from algorithm-specific parameters [35]. Common controlling parameters are common in running any population based optimization algorithms like population size and number of generations while algorithm-specific parameters are specific to that algorithm and different algorithms have differ- ent algorithm-specific parameters to control. For example, GA’s algorithm-specific parameters are mutation rate and crossover rate. Similarly, BBO’s algorithm-specific parameters are maximum immigration rate, maximum emigration rate and mutation rate. The optimal selection of algorithm-specific parameters is also a problem. The improper selection of algorithm-specific parameters decreases the performance of optimization algorithms. Due to the improper selection of algorithm-specific parameters, either the computational cost of the algorithm will increase or yield the local optimal solution [36]. Recently, TLBO algorithm has been widely applied to obtain global optimal solutions for a variety of optimization problems [37–41] with less computational cost and high consistency. From this motivation, the feasibility of TLBO algorithm is investigated to search an optimal combination of thresholds for minimizing the cross entropy.
The objective of this paper is to search an optimal combination of thresholds for minimizing the cross entropy. The selected opti- mal combination of thresholds is used to segment the input image. The proposed thresholding approach is called the TLBO-based min- imum cross entropy thresholding (TLBO-based MCET) algorithm. Here, the fitness function for TLBO algorithm is cross entropy of the input image and segmented image.
In this study, a set of five standard test images is used to eval- uate the performance of the proposed algorithm. The proposed approach is compared with three different approaches included Firefly-based minimum cross entropy thresholding (FF-based MCET) [19], Honey Bee Mating Optimization-based minimum cross entropy thresholding (HBMO-based MCET) [17] and Quan- tum Particle Swarm Optimization-based minimum cross entropy thresholding (Quantam PSO-based MCET) [42].
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 intro- duces the TLBO algorithm. In Section 3, the proposed TLBO-based minimum cross entropy thresholding (TLBO-based MCET) algo- rithm is described in details. Performance evaluation is discussed in detail in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper and suggests future research directions.


Teacher-Learning-based Optimization algorithm

Teacher-Learning-based Optimization (TLBO) algorithm is a new kind of metaheuristic algorithm that is based on a teaching– learning process. It is firstly introduced by Rao et al. [32] to solve constrained mechanical design optimization problems. It is inspired by passing on knowledge within a classroom environment



where students first gain knowledge from a teacher and then through mutual interaction [34]. TLBO algorithm is a population-
based optimization algorithm in which a group or class of students

+ r(Xk
— Xk )

considered as population. Thus, a student of class represents a fea- sible solution of the problem. Different subjects offered to the class are considered as different design variables of the optimization problem and student’s result is treated as the fitness value of fea- sible solution of the optimization problem.
TLBO algorithm consists of two phases: Teacher phase and stu-

level of students and helps students to obtain good marks. But, stu- dents gain knowledge and obtain marks according to the quality of teaching delivered by the teacher and the quality of students pre- sent in the class. For simulation, suppose there are ‘n’ number of subjects (design variables, j = 1, 2,.. .,n) offered to ‘Np’ number of students (population size, i = 1, 2,.. .,Np). At any teaching-learning

in a particular subject ’j’. Teacher is the most experienced, knowl- edgeable and highly learned person in the society. To simulate this concept, the best student (feasible solution) in the entire popula-
tion is considered as teacher. Let Xk be the most feasible solution of the population at kth teaching-learning cycle and Xk denotes the jth design variable in the best feasible solution of the popula-
tion at kth teaching-learning cycle i.e. the result of the teacher in
subject ‘j’. The difference between the result of the teacher and the mean result of the students in subject ‘j’ is given by [32]
Dk = r(Xk — TF Mk)	(1)
where TF is a teaching factor that decides the value of the mean to
be changed and r is a random number in the range [0 1]. TF is not a parameter of the TLBO algorithm and its value can either be 1 or 2 [36].
Feasible solutions (students) are improved by moving their positions towards the position of the best feasible solution (tea- cher) by taking into account the current mean value of the feasible solutions. To simulate this fact, the ith feasible solution in the pop- ulation at kth teaching-learning cycle is updated according to the following expression:
Basic TLBO algorithm

Based upon the above discussion, TLBO algorithm can be re- written in the following steps [32,43]:

Step1: [Initialization] Initialize the optimization parameters
Population size (the number of students or learners): Np
Number of iterations: In
Number of design variables or parameters (the subjects or courses offered)
Limits of design variables
Step2: [Initialize the population]
Generate random population according to the population size and the number of design variables.

rejected. All the accepted feasible solutions are maintained and these become the input to the student phase.

Student phase

In this phase, students gain knowledge through mutual interac- tion. A student interacts randomly with other students of the class to improve knowledge. A student (u) learns something new from
another student (v) of the class if student (v) has more knowledge than student (u). Thus, if student (v) is better than student (u), then student (u) is moved towards student (v). Otherwise, student (u) is moved away from student (v). The learning philosophy of this phase is simulated as below:
Two students (feasible solutions, Xk , Xk ) are randomly selected

Proposed TLBO-based MCET algorithm

In this section, first the objective function based on cross entropy is generated. After this, the generated objective function is minimized using Teaching-Learning-based Optimization (TLBO) algorithm to obtain multilevel threshold values for segmenting images.

Cross entropy based objective function

The cross entropy was developed by Kullback [44] in 1968. The cross entropy is a measure of closeness between two sampling dis-
tributions. Let P = {p ; p ; ... ; p } and Q = {q ; q ; ... ; q } be two

numbers   belong   to    [1;  Np]   and   u–v. from the class (population), where, u, v are two integer random
probability distributions defined on the same set of values. The cross entropy between P and Q is defined as

then pr = hr/(M × N) is the probability of occurrence of gray level occurrence of a particular gray level value r in the digital image f, value r in the image.

For bi-level image segmentation, a threshold value T1 ∈ [0; Lmax]
is selected that segments the image into two regions: one is Back-
ground (BG) and other is Target (TG). Gray level values of all pixels
pixels of TG region is greater than T1. In segmented image gT1 (x; y), of BG region is less than or equal to T1 while gray level values of all belongingness of pixel (x; y) to BG and TG regions is described as
In segmentation, the main goal is to minimize the variance between input image and segmented image. So here, the main objective is to find an optimal value of threshold value (T1) such that the total cross entropy (EC) of the input image and segmented image is minimal.

Experimental results &Analysis

In this section, the proposed TLBO-based minimum cross entropy thresholding (TLBO-based MCET) algorithm is imple- mented in MATLAB 7.7.0 (R2008b) with 2.2 GHz Intel(R) Core (TM) 2 Duo CPU T7500 machine of 1.99 GB RAM. The fitness func- tion for the proposed work is cross entropy of the input image and segmented image as shown in the following equation:
X  1	 m1(Ti—1, Ti) 
Here, Teaching-Learning-based Optimization (TLBO) algorithm is used to find an optimal combination of threshold values
(T1, T2, .. . Tk—1) for minimizing the cross entropy.
‘‘Cameraman” and ‘‘Goldhill” with size 512 × 512, 512 × 512, Five standard test images, named ‘‘Lena”, ‘‘Pepper”, ‘‘Bird”,
204 × 204, 256 × 256 and 512 × 512, respectively, are used for
conducting experiments. These original standard images are
shown in Fig. 2(a) - 6(a) and their histograms are shown in Fig. 2
(b) - 6(b). The segmented images with different thresholds using the proposed approach are illustrated in Fig. 2(c, e, g, i) – Fig. 6(c, e, g, i) and the performance characteristics of the proposed approach to segment five standard test images with different thresholds are displayed in Fig. 2(d, f, h, j) – Fig. 6(d, f, h, j). As we increase the number of thresholds, the segmented image rapidly tends the original image form the visual point of view. Fig. 2(c, e, g, i) – Fig. 6(c, e, g, i) show that segmented images obtained from the proposed approach at different levels are visu- ally acceptable. Thus, from subjective evaluation point of view, it is observed that the proposed approach (TLBO-based MCET algo- rithm) has ability to segment images. For comparative analysis, three other algorithms namely Quantum PSO-based MCET, FF- based MCET and HBMO-based MCET are considered. (See Figs. 3–5) In order to obtain the objective evaluation of the proposed algo- rithm and the consistent comparison analysis with other methods, two most popular objective elevation parameters, peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) [17,19] and uniformity [16,18], are used.

For evaluating the performance of the proposed TLBO-based MCET algorithm, five standard test images are segmented by this algorithm at 2-level, 3-level, 4-level and 5-level. The performance metrics for checking the effectiveness of the proposed approach are PSNR and uniformity which are used to determine the quality of the segmented images. For comparison, the results of Quantum PSO-based MCET, FF-based MCET and HBMO-based MCET algo- rithms are also considered for the same five standard test images. Table 1 shows the selected thresholds (2, 3, 4 and 5 threshold val- ues) of the five test images using TLBO-based MCET algorithm, Quantum PSO-based MCET, FF-based MCET and HBMO-based MCET algorithms. PSNR and uniformity values of five segmented images obtained by TLBO-based MCET, Quantum PSO-based MCET, FF-based MCET and HBMO-based MCET algorithms are tabulated
in Table 2 and Table 3 respectively. Table 4 shows the fitness val- ues of objective function obtained by TLBO-based MCET, Quantum PSO-based MCET, FF-based MCET and HBMO-based MCET algo- rithms to segment five standard test images at various levels. Table 2, Table3 and Table 4 provide quantitative standard for eval- uating. Such tables show that the number of thresholds increase, the PSNR, the uniformity and the fitness value are enlarged. From Table 1, it is found there is no significance difference in the selected thresholds at various levels for four test images, named ‘‘Pepper”, ‘‘Bird”, ‘‘Cameraman” and ‘‘Goldhill” by TLBO-based MCET algo- rithm, Quantum PSO-based MCET, FF-based MCET and HBMO- based MCET algorithms. However, there is significance difference in the selected thresholds at various levels for ‘‘Lena” standard test image by the proposed approach as compared to other algorithms.

In this case, the proposed approach is superior to the other meth- ods in terms of uniformity and fitness value. Form experimental results, it is possible to appear the fact that the selected thresholds of the TLBO-based MCET algorithm can effectively find the ade- quate solutions based on the minimum cross entropy criterion. Thus, we can say that the proposed method is an efficient and fea- sible method to search an optimal combination of threshold values at 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th levels.
Table 5 shows the computation time and the number of itera- tions required to find an optimal combination of threshold values at 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th levels for the segmentation of five standard test images. From computational complexity point of view, table values indicate that the proposed algorithm has an ability to find an optimal combination of threshold values at 2nd, 3rd, 4th and
5th levels for the segmentation of standard test images in the rea- sonable amount of time and iterations.


Conclusion and future scope

In this paper, a new multilevel image thresholding approach based on Teacher-Learning-based Optimization, which is named TLBO-based minimum cross entropy thresholding (TLBO-based MCET) algorithm, has been presented to find multilevel optimal threshold values for segmenting gray-scale digital images. Optimal combinations of threshold values at 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th levels are searched by TLBO for five standard test images, named ‘‘Lena”, ‘‘Pepper”, ‘‘Bird”, ‘‘Cameraman” and ‘‘Goldhill”.

The major contribution of the proposed approach is the applica- tion of the cross entropy based TLBO for gray-scale digital image segmentation. The proposed approach is a new variant of multi- level thresholding algorithm to segment gray-scale digital images by employing the concept of cross entropy. The proposed algo- rithm selects multilevel optimal threshold values to segment gray-scale digital images. This is done by the concept of cross entropy and framing the problem of threshold selection as an opti- mization problem. Here, the optimization problem is to minimize the cross entropy between the segmented image and the original image. One of recent optimization techniques named Teaching- Learning-based Optimization (TLBO) has been used to solve the optimization problem. The proposed approach is novel, as the con- cept of multilevel threshold selection has not been explored using cross entropy and TLBO. To examine the performance of the pro- posed approach, five different standard digital test images have been segmented through selected threshold values at 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th levels by the proposed approach. The simulation and experimental results show the proposed algorithm has an ability to search multilevel optimal threshold values to segment digital images. For evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, two measures, namely PSNR, uniformity, are used. PSNR and uni- formity are used to measure the quality of the thresholded images. From the experimental results on various types of images, it is observed that the proposed method produces the better quality thresholded images than the compared methods. Thus, the pro- posed method is an efficient method to search multilevel optimal threshold values for segmenting digital images.
The proposed approach has great potential future in the field of image segmentation. The work is under further progress to seg- ment medical images like mammograms, CT or MR images.
