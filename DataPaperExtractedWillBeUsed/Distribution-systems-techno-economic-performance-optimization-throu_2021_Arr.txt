This article presents three new multi-objective optimization methodologies as a solution for enhancing the
traditional EDN techno-economic performance through integrating Distributed Generation (DG) of different
categories. A combination of four types of DG resources is presented for identifying the optimal mix sizing and
positioning through applying the Whale Optimization Algorithm, Sine Cosine Algorithm and Multi-Verse Opti-
mization Algorithm. The proposed approaches are constructed and subjected to a multi-objective function to
minimize the active power losses, improve the voltage Stability and decrease overall additional costs. While
taking into consideration the allowable margin of DG units’ penetration level and their operating power factor in
addition to the systems’ voltage proﬁle boundaries. The methodologies have been applied to two IEEE benchmark
test systems (33-bus and 118-bus) besides a realistic part of the distribution grid of the Egyptian distribution
network which is added as a practical case study. However, the proposed base cases have failed in keeping the
voltage magnitudes boundaries at all busbars especially the realistic case, but the proposed algorithms have
attained almost the same signiﬁcant results regarding both of voltage stability and power loss for the medium-
sized network IEEE 33-bus system. Furthermore, for both of the two large scale systems (IEEE 118-bus system
and the realistic network), the MVO has proved its superiority compared to the proposed algorithms in addressing
the optimization problem with higher results’ accuracy. Meanwhile, the MVO has reached the optimal solutions
for all cases in less time and iterations number.
1. Introduction
The transition towards sustainable electric power systems is facing
many techno-economic and environmental challenges in recent years;
this has led researchers to think about ﬁnding suitable solutions to these
challenges. The national and international vision towards a clean envi-
ronment, the increased electricity demand, as well as the fast develop-
ment of RERs prices and technologies have played an important role in
the progress of the DG resources integration to the Electric Distribution
Networks (EDNs) and they are predicted to be commonly used in the near
future [1]. DGs are locally supplying the consumers with electricity, as it
is connected directly to load centers, and as a result, they reduce the
overall expenditure needed for the new centralized power plants and
transmission lines infrastructure projects [2]. Modern DG-integrated
EDNs performance is affected by several factors, including penetration
level, DGs technologies, operating scenarios and location. Optimized
sizing and siting of various forms of DGs due to predeﬁned study based on
speciﬁc objectives and limitations play a signiﬁcant role in achieving
positive outcomes and eliminating their negative impacts [3]. The EDNs
voltage proﬁle and the active power losses are inﬂuenced according to
the distribution system topology. The voltage stability is used as an
important indication to ensure the voltage stability of the entire system.
DGs integration planning will require an analysis of several variables,
such as DGs’ number, capacities, the best possible locations, and the
operating characteristics impact on the system performance such as
system loss, voltage proﬁle, economics, stability and reliability issues [4].
Some of the technical key advantages of the DG-integrated EDNs are:
improving the voltage proﬁle, reducing the EDNs losses, improving fre-
quency, increasing the overall energy efﬁciency, reducing the pollutants
emissions, enhancing the EDNs security and reliability, relieving the

transmission and distribution congestion, and improving the power
quality. Some of the other economic advantages are delaying the total
investments required for upgrading the facilities, reducing the opera-
tional fuel costs, reducing the reserve requirements and the associated
costs, and increasing the security for critical loads [5]. The determination
of the optimal capacity and placement of DG units in the distribution
systems is of great importance for achieving their highest potential
positive effects. Researches have demonstrated that an improper selec-
tion of the position and size of DG could lead to greater system active
power losses and voltage deviations [1]. Therefore, several scientiﬁc
researches have tried to address the optimal siting and capacity of DG
units in EDNs through many different approaches. The techniques may be
categorized
into
four
categories:
Analytical
Expressions
(AEs),
Meta-heuristic techniques (MMs), Numerical Methods (NMs), and
Analytical Expressions Meta-Heuristic Methods (AEMMs) [6,7]. In
Ref. [8], the authors presented three multi-objective optimization
mechanisms to reduce the active power losses and to improve the voltage
proﬁle, within maintaining the framework of the DG cost installation
constraints, through determining its optimum placement and size into
the distribution networks. Three intelligent optimization techniques
Practical Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithms (GA), and
Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) are introduced to prove their ef-
ﬁciency. A comparative analysis of different optimization techniques,
including Moth-Flame Optimization (MFO), Dragonﬂy Algorithm (DA)
and Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), was proposed in Ref. [9] to
determine the optimum locations and sizes of DGs in radial EDNs to
reduce the active power losses. The suggested techniques have been
implemented on IEEE 69-bus and 119-bus under two load power factors.
Results showed that MFO gives better ﬁndings than WOA and DA algo-
rithms. WOA is used to determine the DG units’ sizing and siting opti-
mization problem in many researches as follows: In Ref. [10], different
DG types are employed through applying the WOA on IEEE 15-bus,
33-bus, 69-bus, 85-bus and 118-bus benchmark test systems. The ﬁnd-
ings of the proposed technique have been compared to various forms of
evolutionary algorithms. The attained results from the WOA algorithm
proved that it is better when integrating DG type that injects both real
and reactive power at 0.9 pf. In addition, a complicated problem of DGs
sizing and location is addressed in Ref. [11]. Where, WOA algorithm is
tested on IEEE 15, 33, 69 and 85-bus test systems for the active power
losses minimizing and improving the voltage proﬁle as the considered
objectives. In this study, to improve the performance of the system, four
DG types are introduced, but every single type is discussed separately
with a ﬁxed power factor value. The WOA proved its capability of
ﬁnding-high quality solutions for large-scale systems compared to other
evolutionary algorithms. Furthermore, a WOA-SCA Hybrid algorithm for
improving the bus voltages of the DG-integrated EDNS is explained in
Ref. [12] through the allocation of DSTATCOMs and DGs on IEEE33-bus
and IEEE-69 bus. The exploration and exploitation steps of the proposed
scheme are determined using Sine Cosine Algorithm (SCA) and WOA,
respectively, to improve the convergence rate of the WOA. Results
proved the enhancement in the voltage proﬁle and reduction of the total
systems losses. Moreover, in Ref. [13], WOA is introduced for single DG
integration into the IEEE 30-bus radial transmission system. Before the
optimization phase, a preconﬁgured Fast Voltage Stability Index (FVSI)
has been used as an indication to identify the location of installing the
single DG. The achieved results have been veriﬁed with the Fireﬂy al-
gorithm (FA) and WOA showed more improvement in voltage stability,
the voltage proﬁle and power losses. The Multi-Verse Optimization Al-
gorithm (MVO) technique has been proposed in Ref. [14] and applied
into two benchmark test systems (IEEE 33-bus and IEEE 69-bus) for the
optimal solution of single DG type accommodation in the EDN. A
multi-objective function is formulated to improve the performance of
EDNs. The objectives considered are decreasing the active power losses,
minimizing the voltage deviation and enhancing the VSI. The ﬁndings
are compared to the results attained by GA, PSO, hybrid GA-PSO,
Teaching Learning Based Optimization (TLBO) and Quasi-Oppositional
Learning Based Optimization (QOTLBO) algorithms and found to be
efﬁcient. SCA has been employed to ﬁnd the optimum size and location
of single and two DGs in radial EDNs in Ref. [15]. The proposed meth-
odology is tested on IEEE 15, 33, 69 and 85 radial EDNs. Minimizing the
power loss and improvement of the voltage proﬁle are the main objec-
tives of this research. The ﬁndings obtained have demonstrated the

validity of the proposed method and its positive effects on the system in
terms of power loss reduction and the improvement of the voltage proﬁle
and have demonstrated the efﬁcacy and robustness of the proposed
method. From the above initial review, it is noticed that, however, many
optimization algorithms have been applied to solve the DG location and
size problem concerning the different ﬁtness functions, which aims to
improve the distribution network’s performance. Most of these re-
searches considered the operating power factor of the DG units a ﬁxed
value and not an optimization vector variable. In addition, the proposed
techniques have been applied to small-scale IEEE test systems and have
not been subjected to practical case studies. Also, the DG units’ max
capacity ranges have not been set and did not consider the branches’
security constraints. Besides that, the multi-DGs problem of multi-types
has not been addressed at the same time to ﬁnd the optimal mix of DG
types. Moreover, the additional required investments are not considered
as an optimization objective at the same time to get the optimal solutions
with minimum expenditures. The major contributions of the presented
article can be summarized as follow: (i) This research proposes three
novel algorithms called Whale Optimization Algorithm, Sine Cosine Al-
gorithm and Multi-Verse Optimization Algorithm for solving four types
of DERs allocation problem. (ii) Formulating a multi objective function to
optimize the Voltage Stability, the active power losses and the overall
costs is developed. (iii) The system’s operational variables are considered
such as the DG units operating power factor in addition to the system’s
policies and regulations constraints including (a) the operating power
factor limitations, (b) the system’s voltage proﬁle boundaries and (c) DG
units’ penetration level range (iv) The proposed approaches are validated
by applying them to various IEEE test systems (33 and 118 buses), in
addition to a realistic case study. (v) The attained results are compared
with other optimization algorithms.
This article’s content is divided into eight sections, as follows: The
characteristics of different used DG types are presented in section II.
Section III discusses the proposed strategic positioning and sizing algo-
rithms. A description of the problem formulation, the objectives and
constraints are given below in section IV. Section V describes the IEEE
benchmark test cases and the practical distribution system. while, Sec-
tion VI presents the problem validation. The ﬁndings are analyzed in
detail in section VII. The conclusion of the paper is outlined in section
VIII.
2. Characteristics of DG types
Most of the DG beneﬁts’ researches have classiﬁed DGs into four
different types. In this study, a combination of four DG types is intro-
duced for siting and sizing problem to determine the optimal mix of DGs.
These types are identiﬁed according to the operation criteria as follows
[16,17]: In the ﬁrst type, the active power only is generated. However,
reactive power only is produced in the second type. In addition, DG re-
sources deliver active and reactive power in the third type. Moreover, in
the fourth type, resources can produce active power and consume reac-
tive power.
3. Proposed algorithms based methodologies
The following three-optimization algorithms are proposed for the
efﬁcient planning of multiple distributed generation resources as follows:
3.1. Whale Optimization Algorithm
The WOA is inspired by the special hunting activity of humpback
whales, which are intelligent swimming creatures. Normally, they tend to
hunt small ﬁshes near to the sea surface. Humpback whales use a
specialized hunting process called the bubble net feeding technique.
Where, they move around the targets and generate distinctive bubbles
across a ring or 9-shaped path [10,18].
To simulate such behavior in WOA, there is a 50% chance of choosing
between both the shrinking encircling system and the spiral system to
change the whale location, which is represented in this research by the
optimization problem vectors, which are DG type, location, size and
operating power factor during the optimization. In WOA, the best current
potential solution is believed to be the target prey and the other search
agents are trying to change their positioning towards it. The numerical
simulation of WOA involves three stages as follows: The encircling prey,
the spiral bubble-net feeding strategy, and the scan for food sources.

3.1.1. The encircling prey stage
The Humpback whales are to identify and encircle the position of the
prey, which is represented as the objectives of minimizing total active
power losses, enhancing the FVSI and minimizing the new cost of in-
vestment. Initially, the WOA considers the target prey (O.F) to be the
current best candidate solution, as the location of the optimal solution is
not known beforehand; this stage is simulated as shown in equation (1)
and (2) and the search candidate will be changed if a better candidate
solution is found.

0. r! is a random vector [0,1].
3.1.2. Bubble-net attacking stage
This is a hunting technique; in it, sharks are doing narrowing encir-
cling mechanism through a spiral update process for positioning, which is
represented in the current work by operating constraints, which are DGs
operating power factor limits, DG capacity penetration levels and voltage
proﬁle boundaries. In the shrinking mechanism A
⇀ which is a random
position value is setting down between interval [-a, a], the updated po-
sition of A
⇀ is determined from equation (3) and its position between the
original position and the current best agent position; this mechanism is
illustrated in Fig. 1. The space between both the whale and the placement
of the prey is evaluated and the helix-shaped motion of the whale is
created, as seen in the following spiral equation (5) to mimic the helix-
shaped movement, which is illustrated in Fig. 2.

Where D
0 is the distance between the whale and the prey, l is a random

3.1.3. Search for prey stage
In this stage, whales are randomly searching for prey and changing
their location (candidate solutions) based on the current place of other
whales. This process completes a search space and is simulated by the
given equation (6):

Where Xn is the vector of random positions, and it is determined by the
current population. The major solution steps of the WOA algorithm is
explained in a detailed ﬂowchart shown in Fig. 4.
3.2. Multi-verse optimization algorithm
Seyedali M. et al. developed MVO [19]. The optimization software
was created based on the idea of the big bang model and the Multiverse
conception. Originally, according to the theory, the Big Bang is simply
the cause of the existence of every element in this world. However, the
latter concept deals with the presence of some universes. Almost every
universe could have various physical rules, which react and collide with
each other according to multiverse theory. The numerical model of MVO

is divided into three different stages, which are black holes, white holes,
and wormholes [20].
White holes: is a mirror image of big-bang and its theory is used
during the exploration step in the optimization process. In this stage, the
promising potential solutions that are considered in this work by the DG
units’ size, location and operating power factor are determined
randomly. Also, the ﬁtness (inﬂation rate) of each randomly generated
population is determined according to upper and lower boundaries,
which are the predeﬁned operating constraints of DGs operating power
factor limits, DG capacity penetration levels, and voltage proﬁle
boundaries from equation (7).

Where Lbj and Ubj are the lower and upper, universe i and k (are selected
from roulette wheel), Uij and Ukj are the parameter-j, UN
i
is the universe-i
normalized inﬂation rate. R , R1, R2 R3 and R4 are random numbers
ranges between [0, 1].
Wormholes: it is responsible for exchanging objects between different
universes or even between different parts of the same universe, and it is
considered as a bridge either for various universes or for separate pieces
of the same universe. In this step, the process of roulette wheels is used to
construct the entire white/black tunnel at normal inﬂation levels, which
can be used for objects exchanges between universes. The inﬂation rates
are evaluated depending on two parameters, which are; the traveling
distance rate (D) and the wormhole existence probability (Wp).

Black holes: its concept is opposite to the white holes. Black holes
have a high gravitational force that attracts anything and its concept is
used in the exploration stage. Then the best universe is found from
randomly generated populations, as shown in equations (10) and (11).
If R2 < Wp and R3 < 0:5 then Uij is calculated from the following
equation:
Uij ¼ Ub

(11)
Where Ub
j is the best universe of the j-parameter. R2, R3 and 4 are random
numbers ranges between [0,1]. WPmax and WPmin are the maximum and
minimum (WP) values. t is the current iteration, tmax represents the
maximum iterations. Besides, p is a parametric value, which decides the
universe, shifting on the sides of the best-found universe. Then, the
exploration and exploitation phases are repeated until the convergence is
attained. Here, the convergence criterion is made equal to the maximum
iterations/generations set to the optimization algorithm. Also, the above
solution steps are explained in a detailed ﬂowchart shown in Fig. 5.
3.2.1. Sine Cosine Algorithm
SCA is an innovative optimization methodology developed in Refs.
[21] by Mirjalili’s, where its function update depends on cosine and sine
function rules. Through the lookup for the optimization problem, the
algorithm randomly begins the ﬁrst population (the optimization prob-
lem vectors, which are DG type, location, size and operating power factor
during the optimization) with random search agents/solutions. Then, the
searching agents are directed to the best position Pi in the searching area
according to the deﬁned ﬁtness function, which consists of minimizing
total active power losses, enhancing the FVSI and minimizing the new
cost of investment. That assesses and evaluates each search agent.
Therefore, the algorithm tracks the P position obtained for each iteration
by evaluating all search agents in the population. The SCA algorithm
numerical model is based on updating Xi search agents [22], as shown in
equation (12).

R2,R3 and k are random numbers which are updated randomly, be-
sides R1 is calculated from the following equation.
R1 ¼ S � t S

t, tmax are the current iteration, and the maximum iterations number
and S is a constant.
The SCA pattern illustrated in Fig. 3. It is a circular pattern method-
ology, where the best P solution exists in the middle of a circle and the
solutions outside it are feasible solutions. The circle search area repre-
sents the above-mentioned system’s operational constraints, which are
determined by upper and lower boundaries for each variable vector
(search agent). In addition, this circle is divided into sub-areas that are
considered possible discovery areas for Xi solution.
R1 is a control parameter which determines the Xi direction of
movement (towards P in case its value > 1 and outward if it is < 1). In
addition, R2 determines the distance of Xi movement outward or inward
P according to R1 and R2 values which are ranging between 0 to 2π. R3 is
giving random weights to P. k is randomly switching between the cosine
and sine parts of Equation (12).
When the sine–cosine function range inside the interval of [-1, þ1],
then Xi movement is towards P and the algorithm is exploiting the search
space. Nevertheless, when the range out of the interval [-1, þ1], then Xi
is deviating the P position and the algorithm is exploring the search
space. The major solution steps of the SCA algorithm are explained in a
detailed ﬂowchart in Fig. 6.
4. Problem formulation
The optimization problem is given by equation (14) and it is a
minimization problem that includes Ploss, total investments cost and FVSI
[23]:
O:F ¼ w1*
� ploss
ploss0
�
þ w2*
� FVSIm
FVSIm0
�
þ w3*
� costDG
costDGmax
�
(14)
Where;
O.F: The objective function; Ploss0: The total active power losses
before installing DG units in (MW); Ploss: The total active power losses
after installing the DG units in (MW); costDG: Total additional cost
required for installing DG units in Million United States Dollar (MUS$);
costDGmax: Maximum DG units cost in MUS$; FVSIm0: Maximum FVSI
before installing DG units; FVSIm: Maximum FVSI after the installing
DGs; W1, W2 and W3: the weighting factors. In addition, W1þW2þW3
¼ 1.
In the previous studies, the ﬁtness function weighting coefﬁcient
values were determined according to the researcher ‘s vision. However,
in this study, the weighting coefﬁcient values are obtained using an
analytical test performed on the benchmark IEEE 33-bus test system to
Fig. 8. A realistic part of the Egyptian distribution Grid.

evaluate their most effective values, which will verify the O.F ‘s optimum
values. When the possible values of W1, W2 and W3 (36 possibilities) are
applied to the test system, the changes in the ﬁtness function components
are monitored and recorded. Fig. 7 illustrates the full effects of the
changes in the weighting factors values on the ﬁtness function elements
namely O. F, Ploss, optimization time and FVSI. Consequently, possibil-
ities from 15 to 36 must be dismissed, as they have no impact on Ploss or
FVSI. Although the ﬁrst option classiﬁcation is the best O.F, its
signiﬁcant effect is on Ploss. It is therefore advised to select the third
alternative that ranks the second optimal O.F value, in which the values
of W1, W2 and W3 are 0.6, 0.3, and 0.1 respectively since they have a
clear effect on both Ploss and FVSI.
4.1. Objectives
The main objectives of this study are enhancing FVSI, minimizing
Ploss as well as minimizing the total additional costs while employing
multi DG units mix at a time.
4.1.1. Fast Voltage Stability Index (FVSI)
Stability is a key factor in the study of distribution systems. This was
explored in several publications by multiple methodologies. Due to
changes in power generation, the voltage stability of the systems in this
study is advised to prevent the collapse of voltage.
The line stability index can be calculated using the fast and accurate
formula shown in equation (15) for the determination of FVSI [24]. FVSI
results for all lines ranges between zero and one, where this value must

4.2.1. Power factor constraints
In the framework of the multiple types of DGs, the power factor of the
DG units (PFDG) is deﬁned according to their operating conditions as
follows:

This research suggested that DG’s penetration levels ranges from zero
to 30% of the total network demand to preserve the feeders’ ANSI Range
protection constraints [27,28].

5. Study cases
The research presents the application of the three proposed algo-
rithms to different IEEE benchmark systems (33-bus and 118-bus) as
medium and large-scale models to conﬁrm the efﬁciency of the proposed
optimization methodologies in determining the optimal O.F [29–32].
IEEE 33-bus is an RDS consisting of 33-buses, 32 branches, one
central generator, one substation, with a total active and reactive load of
3.71 MW and 2.3 MVAR, respectively. Simulation studies are carried out
on this widely used distribution system to verify the effectiveness of the
proposed optimization techniques in solving the problem of the optimal
placement and sizing of DGs. The key driver of selecting this test system
arises from the fact that the IEEE 33-bus test system has large losses of
power compared to its total capacity, which makes it a suitable selection
to prove the capability of DGs for reducing power losses signiﬁcantly.
IEEE 118-bus is a large scale power system consists of 118-bus, 54
generators and 186 branches with an active and reactive load of 4242
MW and 1438 MVAR, respectively. Therefore, this system is chosen to
perform the study cases, to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed
techniques to larger systems. This system is conducted in light of the
survey, which indicates that few studies are applied to such complex
networks and to check the remarkable performance of the algorithms in
solving such large-scale systems.
Fig. 8 displays a single line diagram of the realistic part of the
Egyptian EDNs from the Canal Electricity Distribution Company (CEDC).
It consists of 171-bus, two 66/11 kV main step-down transformers each
of a 25 MVA rated capacity, and a number of 87 different ratings step-
down transformers (11/0.4 kV) connected directly to loads. The
maximum active and reactive loading of the grid is 15.68 MW and 8.63
MVAR, respectively [33].
6. Algorithms’ validation
The proposed methodologies with the pre-mentioned objectives and
constraints are validated by installing a single DG test (of the ﬁrst and the
third category), this test is applied on the IEEE 33-bus test system. The
obtained outcomes are compared to other existing works. Table 1 sum-
marizes the ﬁndings for both power loss and voltage magnitudes. Where,
it is reported that the single DG of ﬁrst type achieves an improved per-
formance compared to existing approaches. However, it is a DG with
minimal capacity that needs fewer additional costs. It is also noticed that
promising results are obtained while applying a single DG of the third
category for both voltages and power losses with a limited DG’ capacity.
7. Results and discussion
The multi-objective DG siting and sizing algorithms for the four DG
mentioned above types are implemented using Hadisaadat and Mat-
power load ﬂow toolboxes on many benchmark IEEE test systems (33-bus
and 118-bus). Studies are also conducted on a realistic part of the
Egyptian EDNs (171-bus). The Optimal DGs sizing and siting effects on
the system’s Ploss, FVSI, voltage proﬁle and the total additional invest-
ment cost are summarized in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. Table 2 il-
lustrates the base case load ﬂow results, where the attained results are
validated by comparing with Hadisaadat, Matpower and ETAP12.6 re-
sults for the same test systems under the same operating conditions.
Table 3 describes the results achieved by applying the proposed
optimization techniques for each system. The optimal sizes and locations

of DG types mix are determined for each case study using the three-
optimization algorithms. In addition, the third and the fourth DG-type
optimal operating power factor is determined. Furthermore, the ob-
tained results from WOA, MVO and SCA are compared and summarized.
Where it is noticed that MVO scored the optimal results regarding the O.F
value for the three introduced networks. However, there is symmetry
between the obtained results from MVO and WOA in the case of IEEE 33-
bus in addition to another similarity between results of MVO and SCA in
the case of the realistic system.
Furthermore, for the IEEE 33-bus system, it is found that the three-
optimization techniques almost scored the same system’s enhancement
in terms of FVSI and SCA scored the maximum enhancement in terms of
Ploss. Moreover, for the IEEE 118-bus system, WOA scored the maximum
enhancement in terms of Ploss and FVSI, but unfortunately, it was
accompanied by increases in DG type’s number and capacity. In addition,
for the realistic case study, it is reported that both MVO and SCA scored
the optimal enhancement regarding both FVSI and SCA.
7.1. For IEEE 33-bus system
Fig. 9 reﬂects the convergence curves resulted from applying the
three-optimization methodologies into the IEEE 33-bus system. The re-
sults demonstrate that with the same iterations number and at the same
search agents’ dimension, MVO and WOA converge at almost the same
iterations number. However, MVO achieved the best O.F value with a
very slight difference compared to WOA.
From Fig. 10, it is concluded that MVO and WOA almost give the
optimal O.F value. However, Fig. 18 shows that MVO is converged in less
time. Fig. 11 shows that the three-optimization techniques give almost
the same enhancement regarding the system’s FVSI. However, Fig. 13
illustrates that SCA provides a very slight enhanced result in terms of loss
minimization, but this technique is selecting a higher DG capacity of type
I to be installed at bus 12, which leads to a higher O.F value (see Fig. 12).
Fig. 14 shows a comparison between the voltage magnitudes at base
case (without installing any DGs) for each bus (v0) of the IEEE 33-bus test
system and the new voltage magnitudes after applying the optimization
problem. From Fig. 20, it is noted that WOA, SCA and MVO almost
achieved a typical efﬁcient improvement in the overall system’s voltage
proﬁle where the maximum voltage improvement ratio reaches about
5.5% at buses 32 and 33, which are the buses at and near to the location
of the installed DG unit from the third type category.
7.2. For IEEE 118-bus system
The convergence curves are shown in Fig. 15; results showed that for
the same number of iterations (300) and the same number of search
agents (100), MVO converged in the minimum iterations number with
the best O.F value.
From Fig. 16, it can be noticed that MVO scored the best objective
function value, and Fig. 18 illustrates that MVO is also converging at the
minimum running time. However, it is concluded from Figs. 17 and 19
that WOA scored the maximum loss reduction (6.86%) and best FVSI

enhancement, but this improvement was combined with the disadvan-
tage of increasing the DG types mix and capacities.
Fig. 20 shows the voltage proﬁle enhancement of the IEEE 118-bus
system after applying the proposed optimization techniques. The pro-
posed techniques resulted in achieving a voltage proﬁle enhancement in
certain areas of the system. However, MFO achieved a voltage proﬁle
improvement in certain regions of the system, where the maximum
improvement ratio of up to 4.8% regarding the base case at bus 88, where
the DG of the second type is installed.
7.3. For the realistic system
Fig. 21 shows the convergence curves for the realistic system and
results show that the MVO and SCA gave the same optimal value of the
O.F. However, MVO converges in the minimum iterations number.

From Figs. 22, 23 and 25, it is reported that both MVO and SCA scored
almost the same optimal results in terms of O.F, FVSI enhancement and
Ploss reduction that reached about 15.1%. However, WOA converged in
the minimum running time, as shown in Fig. 24.
A promising improvement of the realistic grid voltage proﬁle is shown
in Fig. 26. In addition, it is deduced that the MVO technique resulted in
the best improvement in voltage magnitudes at the busses or near those
to which the third type DG is installed. The maximum voltage improve-
ment occurred at busses 158, 161 and 162 with an improved ratio of up
to 6.3%.
8. Conclusion
This paper has developed a techno-economic multi-objective opti-
mization framework for the multi-distributed generation of different
categories siting and sizing. Three modern optimization algorithms
which are; Whale Optimization Algorithm, Sine Cosine Algorithm and
Multi-Verse Optimization Algorithm are employed to solve objective
function which aims at minimizing the power losses, improving the
systems’ voltage stability and decreasing overall additional costs. This
work considered an allowable margin for the DG units’ penetration level,
operating power factor and the systems’ voltages proﬁle boundaries. The
proposed algorithms are applied on two benchmark test systems IEEE
(33-bus and 118-bus) in addition to a realistic distribution network (171-
bus) in the region of Canal Electricity Distribution Company-Egypt.
The outcomes have proved the effectiveness of the Multi-Verse opti-
mization algorithm, Whale optimization algorithm and Sine Cosine al-
gorithm in addressing the optimization problem compared to other
existing researches. In addition, the proposed algorithms’ have attained
almost the same signiﬁcant results while solving the medium-sized
network IEEE 33-bus system; meanwhile, the MVO has reached the
optimal solution in less time and iterations number. However, for both of
the two large scale systems (IEEE 118-bus system and the realistic
network), the MVO has proved its superiority compared to the proposed
algorithms in addressing the optimization problem with higher results’
accuracy in less time and iterations number. The attained results appli-
cation into the proposed systems (IEEE 33-bus, 118-bus and the realistic
system) have demonstrated that the voltage proﬁles are improved
simultaneously as the system’s voltage stability is enhanced by 19.7%,
15.3% and 21.2%, respectively, whereas, the base cases have failed in
keeping the voltage values boundaries at all busbars. Furthermore, the
active power losses are signiﬁcantly reduced for the above-mentioned
systems by 43.7%, 5.22% and 15.1%, respectively. This work shall be
extended to considering the customer’s hourly demand according to the
Fig. 20. IEEE 118-bus system voltage proﬁle enhancement.
