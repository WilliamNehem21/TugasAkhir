Millions of Muslims come to Makkah in Saudi Arabia annually to perform Hajj, an Islamic pilgrimage
ritual. Many government, private companies, and individuals provide various services and facilities to
overcome difﬁculties that may be encountered by pilgrims. Currently, technology has gained increasing
attention as a major means to provide services. In particular, mobile applications (apps) are contempo-
rary technologies used provide various services. Several organizations and individuals developed a num-
ber of Islamic apps that can be used on smart mobile devices to assist pilgrims to comfortably perform
their Islamic rituals. This paper presents an analytical study of Hajj-related mobile apps offered by
Google Play. The collected apps are analyzed using four main criteria, namely, services offered, languages
supported, installation rates, and repetition of services and names of the app. The ‘‘Hajj ritual” service is
found in 68.7% of the target apps, with English as the main language (51.7%). Apps supporting live video
services are the most downloaded, with frequency exceeding one million times. Results also reveal a
number of repetitive apps in terms of application names and services; for example, 12 apps use the same
label ‘‘Hajj Guide,” and 11 application versions issued by the same publisher are found. Finally, a case
study is performed to rate the quality of 10 apps selected based on ﬁve basic criteria, namely, engage-
ment, functionality, aesthetics, information, and subjective quality. ‘‘Mutawef” and ‘‘Manasikana” apps
have achieved the highest average scores, with 2.69 and 2.62 out of 3 acceptance rates, respectively.

1. Introduction
In Islam, all Muslims worldwide are requested to perform Hajj
once in their lifetime as long as they have the capability to do so.
Hajj is a ritual journey to Makkah and considered the ﬁfth essential
pillar in Islam. This ritual is conducted on the 12th month of the
lunar Islamic calendar, namely, ‘‘Dhul Hijjah.” Hajj includes many
rites, which must be performed according to the sequence of
events. The rituals start by making intentions and wearing Ihram
at Miqats before arriving in Makkah. Pilgrims then wait for the
eighth day of Dhul Hijjah to move to Mina. On the ninth day of
Dhul Hijjah, all pilgrims proceed to Arafat and stay until sunset
before moving to Muzdalifah. Throwing of stones is performed in
Al-Jamarat the 10th to 13th days of Dhul Hijjah. Finally, Hajj ends
by performing farewell circling (Tawaf al-Wadaa) around the holy
house (Ka’bah) and leaving Makkah. During this holy journey,
many rituals must be performed in different places at a speciﬁc
time. Fig. 1 shows a map of places where the Hajj rituals should
be performed.
Many pilgrims also aim to visit Al-Madinah (the city of the pro-
phet Mohammed, peace be upon him) before or after performing
Hajj. The Umrah, another ritual related to Hajj, can be performed
anytime through the year; however, many pilgrims perform this
ritual directly before Hajj.
Many services, such as guidance, awareness, transportation, and
accommodation, are required during Hajj and Umrah seasons
because of the huge number of pilgrims and the diversity of rituals
that they have to perform. Government and private agencies and
individuals compete to provide services in different ways. Every
year, new services are developed by exploiting advances in tech-
nologies and service industries.
One of the modern technologies evolving is software applica-
tions, commonly known as ‘‘apps,” for mobile devices. Hundreds
of apps are available online on iPhone and Android platforms to
help people who are planning to perform Hajj or Umrah. These
apps should be studied and evaluated using speciﬁc criteria to
maximize their beneﬁts. However, different criteria of Islamic apps
have been rarely investigated and are thus the focus of the present
research.
This paper is organized into two major parts. In the ﬁrst part, all
apps designed for Hajj and Umrah services and published by ‘‘Goo-
gle Play,” are surveyed and analyzed. In the second part, the criteria
of 10 apps selected are evaluated using a recently developed
method, namely, mobile app rating scale (MARS) [15].
The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 dis-
cusses previous related works. Section 3 presents the proposed
methodology. Section 4 provides an analysis and comparison of
apps dedicated for Hajj and Umrah. Section 5 displays the results
of the assessment of the apps. Section 6 concludes the paper.
2. Literature review
Scholars have designed and evaluated a number of mobile
applications. Delikostidis et al [26] study the usability of mobile
applications in virtual environments according to some criteria,
such as efﬁciency and effectiveness of task completion, number
of errors made by the users, and satisfaction while using the appli-
cation. Moumane et al [27] performed an empirical study using a
set of measures to evaluate the usability of mobile applications
running on different mobile operating systems. A previous study
by Harleen et al [28] elucidated key characteristics that deﬁne
mobile applications to facilitate the delivery of exceptional, valu-
able, and user-friendly mobile apps that satisfy the requirements
of users.
A systematic literature review was conducted by Méndez et al
[30] to identify and accumulate evidence regarding automated
testing of mobile applications. Usability is measured in terms of
three attributes, namely, effectiveness, efﬁciency, and satisfaction;
as such, other attributes, such as cognitive load, may be disre-
garded. To address the limitations of existing usability models
when applied to mobile devices, Rachel et al [31] proposed a
usability model, namely, people at the center of mobile application
development.

Scholars also reviewed mobile applications for a speciﬁc ﬁeld.
Various mobile applications have been developed for health ser-
vices, such as cardiology [24], heart failure symptoms [25], and
diabetes [35]. Another study conducted by Boudreaux et al [29]
where seven strategies for evaluating and selecting health-
related applications are proposed.
Mobile applications are also used in education, particularly in
language learning [38,39], m-learning [41,42], and use of smart-
phone applications by undergraduate students [40]. These applica-
tions are also used to support children diagnosed with autism
spectrum disorders to enhance their abilities to understand, inter-
act, and communicate with other people by using the Arabic lan-
guage [34].
Studies investigated mobile applications for tourism [32,33]
and for religious and spiritual services [36,37]. However, no study
has reviewed mobile applications for pilgrimage.
Some researchers developed mobile applications for different
Hajj and Umrah services. A number of master theses were con-
ducted to build mobile applications to guide Malaysian pilgrims
[1,11–14]. In another MSc thesis by Mayada [9], augmented reality
was proposed to guide pilgrims. Ahmed et al [2,3] developed a
mobile applications to help pilgrims read Hajj and Umrah prayers
and understand their meanings by translating them into the lan-
guage of the pilgrims. Akhlaq et al [4] proposed a framework that
serves as a crowd-sourcing platform to deﬁne the requirements of
pilgrims for services. The proposed framework uses mobile sensory
data to deﬁne the context of the users. This framework was used to
develop a mobile application for many spatio-temporal services.
Also, a mobile application was proposed in [5] to serve as a dic-
tionary for pilgrims who speak the Malay language. This applica-
tion can translate among languages, namely, Malay, Arabic, and
English.
In another study, Aladdein and Qasem [6] proposed the use of a
mobile phone as a tracking device. This strategy can be used by the
guide (Mutawwif) of a group of pilgrims to recognize their
movements and determine their location. Fathi and Christian [7]
developed a dynamic signage system implemented as a mobile
application to inform pilgrims about the crowd status around the
Holy Ka’bah. This system can also be used as an automatic counter
for the number of Tawaf rounds. Hasimah [8] proposed another
mobile application that can be used to guide pilgrims when per-
forming Hajj and Umrah services. The application also functions
as location tracker and Tawaf counter. Location identiﬁcation
service for Hajj was proposed by Mohamed et al [10]. This mobile
application service was developed to collect information about the
location of pilgrims to identify and track them.
A recent study by Abdelazeez and Shaout [21] developed a
mobile translation application to facilitate the communications
between pilgrimages. This application is available in many lan-
guages and employs text and voice recognition technologies to
assist pilgrims in ﬁnding and displaying the translation of the tar-
get words. Shaout and Khan [22] introduced the ‘‘Al-Hajj” mobile
application to allow pilgrims to understand Hajj-related activities.
The supported application exhibits four interactive features,
namely, checklist, map, contact list, and motivational messages.
The possibility of using smartphone apps to conduct surveys is
studied by Alqahtani et al [23]. The study focused on collecting rel-
evant data and information during mass gatherings, which play an
important role in improving public health by reinforcing knowl-
edge associated with disease prevention.
Based on this literature review, no study has evaluated and ana-
lyzed mobile applications for Hajj and Umrah services. Hence, this
study is of considerable importance.
3. Methodology
The research methodology used in this study consists of two
parts as illustrated in Fig. 2. The ﬁrst part presents a review of
the properties of the Google Play apps. This part starts by review-
ing the literature about the apps that are directed to Hajj and

Umrah rituals. Then, the apps that include the word ‘‘Hajj” in the
title or description of the apps are studied during the period
September 9–30, 2016. Afterward, data collection is built based
on the app features where each app has its own record, including
access date, app names, supported services and languages, pub-
lisher name, the frequency of installation, and the reference that
offered the apps. After the data collection, a statistical analysis is
performed on four main criteria, namely, services provided, lan-
guages supported, installation rates, and repetition cases. Finally,
an analysis study of the collected app records is performed, and
the results are reported.
The second part presents a case study for ten apps selected
according to particular criteria. A questionnaire based on mobile
app rating scale [16] evaluation criteria is prepared and sent to a
number of contributors. The contributors who participated in this
study have different experiences, backgrounds, and educational
levels, thus enriching this evaluation study. Then, the question-
naire data are collected to perform a statistical analysis. Finally,
the achieved results are reported.
4. Hajj and Umrah mobile apps
A survey was conducted, during Hajj season (2016), for all apps
supported by Google Play during the period September 9–30, 2016.
The number of apps covered in this survey was 246, and the
observed apps reached 51 services. Table 1 displays the various
services provided by the apps targeted in this study and the num-
ber of apps that share the same service.
4.1. Offered mobile application services
The results show that the ‘‘Hajj ritual” service has the largest
portion compared with other services provided by the apps where
the ‘‘Hajj ritual” service is found in 68.7% of targeted apps, followed
by ‘‘Umrah ritual” and ‘‘supplications” with 47.5% and 32.5%,
respectively. Moreover, ‘‘funeral provisions,” ‘‘Hajj portal,” ‘‘statis-
tics,” and ‘‘crowd status” have the lowest portion of 0.4% for each.
Each mobile application can contain one or more services, up to 23
services as found in the ‘‘Mutawef” apps. Fig. 3 shows the relation-
ship between the numbers of apps that share a speciﬁc service.
4.2. Languages supported by mobile applications
The studied apps support 24 languages in total, covering the
languages used by most of the Muslims around the world. In
Fig. 4, more than 51.7% of the apps support the English language.
Most of the apps support a single language. The results show that
87.4% of apps support only one language, 7.3% of apps support two
languages, and 5.3% of apps support three to sixteen languages. The
observed apps, the number of services supported, and languages
supported are indicated in Appendix A, Table A.1. (Note that the
keyword ‘‘multi” in the languages column means supporting more
than two languages.)
4.3. Installation rates of mobile applications
A good indicator of the usability of a mobile application is the
number of downloads, which is mainly due to providing a variety
of services and languages. Fig. 5 shows the number of apps catego-
rized by the number of downloads. This ﬁgure shows that most
apps were downloaded between 10,000 and 50,000 times. We
found that the least downloaded apps are non-free apps, such as
the ‘‘Hajj player I URDU-INDIA” app.
Moreover, the results show that apps supporting live video ser-
vices are the most preferred by users. The application ‘‘Watch Live
Makkah 24 Hours HD,” which supports live video services, has
been downloaded for over one million times. Furthermore, apps
supporting images and wallpaper services are widely used and
downloaded by over 100,000 times.
4.4. Repetitive apps
The results show that a number of apps that provide the same
services and emerge from the same publisher are presented in
Table 2. In addition, some apps have the same name (i.e., exact
names) as depicted in Fig. 6. The phrase ‘‘Hajj Guide” is the most
frequent application name used, reaching 12 times with different
publishers and supported services. We consider that the matched
phrases, such as ‘‘Hajj and Umrah,” ‘‘Hajj o Umrah,” and ‘‘Hajj &
Umrah,” are different phrases.

4.5. Observation notes
In preparing this study for the apps offered in the Google store,
we found a number of apps that are no longer available in the store
during Hajj season 2016 (Table 3) despite some of these apps, such
as ‘‘Mecca Hajj live wallpaper” app, having a high application
download frequency. We found that some of the missed apps con-
tain special and interesting modern services, such as ‘‘augmented
reality.” ‘‘Augmented reality” is not available in all studied apps.
Moreover, the study relived a weakness in presenting interactive
features, such as virtual communicating system (e.g., fatwa chat-
ting), pilgrim crowd management, and real-time map updating.

Another important missed service is that no app can offer services
to blind or low-vision users.
5. Case study: assessment of Hajj mobile apps
This section is directed to study and to evaluate some of the sur-
veyed apps. A questionnaire is prepared to collect data from users
for the selected apps. The criteria for selecting particular apps are
discussed in the following subsection.
5.1. Mobile application selection criteria
Ten apps were selected as the case study. We selected the apps
that ﬁt the two criteria as follows:
� Providing at least two services,
� Published by governmental or private organizations; i.e., we
exclude apps published by individuals and non-organizational
agencies.
The selected apps and their relative information are presented
in Table 4. As can be seen in the table, four out of ten apps pub-
lished their last updated versions after starting Hajj activities in
Hajj season 2016, and two apps published their last updated ver-
sions during Hajj season 2015. The apps discussed in this study
do not mean that they are the best among other offered apps.
5.2. Questionnaire design and data collection
After we determined the target apps, we prepared a survey to
evaluate the quality of the selected apps. A number of methods
are designed to evaluate different special purpose apps.

One of the useful methods used to assess apps is the MARS pro-
posed by Stoyanov et al. [15]. The criteria deﬁned in the MARS
evaluation method can cover the main dimensions of the app qual-
ity in our study. However, the MARS method is originally designed
to rate the quality of mobile health apps and has been used in
many recent studies [17–20].
The MARS method contains four categories, namely, engage-
ment, functionality, aesthetics, and information quality, for assess-
ing the quality of apps. Rating the apps according to these
categories will provide better app evaluation compared with the
user ratings in the app store. The subjective quality of each cate-
gory contains a number of items as shown in Table 5.
The study is regarding the accuracy of the evaluation apps;
therefore, the sample of this study is nominated according to their
prior knowledge and experience in using different apps in general
and for Islamic apps in particular.
Two groups of expert users were involved in evaluating the
selected apps. Group A comprises of 10 specialists working as the
custodians of the Two Holy Mosques Institute for Hajj and Umrah
Research, whereas Group B consists of 11 specialists working in the
Information Technology Center of the General Presidency of the
Affairs of the Holy Mosque and the Prophet’s Mosque. The partici-
pants of the questionnaire hold different academic degrees and
practical experiences in their ﬁelds.

5.3. Analysis and discussion
We averaged the scores of the collected application surveys
according to the MARS categories. Each MARS item uses a three-
point scale, a score for each category is calculated as the mean of
all belonging items, and the overall score is calculated as an aver-
age across the categories.
Fig. 7 illustrates the total average score of each MARS category
(engagement, functionality, aesthetics, and information) for the
selected app. The results demonstrate that the ‘‘Mutawef” app
has the highest rank MARS scores with 2.73, and then ‘‘Mana-
sikana” and ‘‘Salam” apps with 2.66 and 2.42, respectively. More-
over, the results show that the ‘‘Smart Hajj” app has the lowest
rank among others (1.02) because of disabling all its functions dur-
ing the period of this study.
Fig. 8 depicts the average score of the ‘‘subjective quality” MARS
score; the highest average is observed for ‘‘Mutawef” app with
2.55, then ‘‘Manasikana,” ‘‘Tarwiah,” and ‘‘Salam,” which reﬂects
the overall satisfaction and acceptance of a user while using the
app. The results also show that the average score of 4 out of 10
apps is below 1.5, indicating that the users are not feeling enjoy-
able while using the app features.
6. Conclusion
In this paper, we conducted a survey for the available Islamic
apps related to Hajj and Umrah. The paper provided a detailed
study of all features and services of the surveyed apps.
The behavior trends of the mobile application providers and
users are studied. The results showed that most of the app provi-
ders focused on developing Hajj and Umrah ritual services in a
basic and non-interactive manner, whereas the attitudes of the
users are directed toward the visualized app services.
The result demonstrated that the most downloaded mobile
application is for the live video service application, namely, ‘‘Watch
Live Makkah 24 Hours HD,” with more than one million download
times. Furthermore, the results for the popular downloaded apps
(apps that were downloaded more than 100,000 times) showed that
apps supporting images and wallpaper services are the most widely
used apps and are preferred by users. Furthermore, the least down-
loaded apps are the non-free apps, such as ‘‘Hajj player I URDU-
INDIA” app. Also, more than 87% of studied apps support only one
language even though some of them include interesting features
such as ‘‘Mutawef” and ‘‘Virtual Hajj & Umrah Guide 3D” apps.
This study also performed a case study for some apps selected
according
to
speciﬁc
criteria.
The
results
showed
that
the
‘‘Mutawef” mobile application had the best average MARS score
among the other apps with 2.73 out of 3, followed by ‘‘Mana-
sikana” mobile application with 2.66 average MARS score. In addi-
tion, the observed results revealed important issues regarding the
overall satisfaction of the users in using the selected apps, where
the average subjective quality score for some of the studied apps
does not reach the mid-average score (1.5), which should be con-
sidered in improving the provided services and functions in the
future.
Finally, we expect that this study can provide good directions to
researchers and application developers in improving the services
provided for Muslim pilgrims and visitors and consider the most
desirable features targeted and desired by users.
