A reliable and accurate forecasting model for crop yields is crucial for effective decision-making in every agricul-
tural sector. Machine learning approaches allow for building such predictive models, but the quality of predic-
tions decreases if data is scarce. In this work, we proposed data-augmentation for wheat yield forecasting in
the presence of small data sets of two distinct Provinces in Algeria. We ﬁrst increased the dimension of each
data set by adding more features, and then we augmented the size of the data by merging the two data sets.
To assess the effectiveness of data-augmentation approaches, we conducted three sets of experiments based
on three data sets: the primary data sets, data sets with additional features and the augmented data sets obtained
by merging, using ﬁve regression models (Support Vector Regression, Random Forest, Extreme Learning
Machine, Artiﬁcial Neural Network, Deep Neural Network). To evaluate the models, we used cross-validation;
the results showed an overall increase in performance with the augmented data. DNN outperformed the other
models for the ﬁrst Province with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.04 q/ha and R_Squared (R2) of 0.96,
whereas the Random Forest outperformed the other models for the second Province with RMSE of 0.05 q/ha.
The data-augmentation approach proposed in this study showed encouraging results.

1. Introduction
The estimation of crop yield is a crucial task for decision-makers as it
enables efﬁcient planning of resources (Chergui et al., 2020; Gyamerah
et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2019). Economically, yield prediction can help
decision-makers react in the right way on how much to export in the
case of a surplus or make early decisions about quantities, contracts,
agreements and planning of imports in the case of shortage. It can also
help determine the optimal proﬁle of crops to plant and appropriately
allocate government resources. On the other hand, it can help farmers
decide on what and when to grow and plan their harvest and storage
(Chergui et al., 2020). Besides, cereals are considered the most impor-
tant crops in Algeria and play a crucial role in maintaining the food sup-
ply. According to ofﬁcial reports, the estimated need of Algeria for
cereals is around 15 million tons per year. In 2019, production for the
harvest season was estimated at 6 million tons, while it imported nearly
12 million tons. Consequently, timely and accurate yield information is
fateful to decision-makers and sustainable developments. Moreover,
crop yield prediction permits studying factors that inﬂuence and affect
production, such as climate and weather, irrigation and fertilisation
practices, agricultural policies, etc.
Advanced information and communication technologies have
emerged together with machine learning (ML) to create new opportu-
nities to understand processes in agricultural systems where crop
yield prediction is one of their crucial tasks that consists of several
complicated steps. ML is a practical approach that can provide better
yield prediction based on several features (Klompenburg et al., 2020);
ML can determine patterns and correlations and discover knowledge
from data sets. (Klompenburg et al., 2020) present a systematic review
of the literature on crop yield prediction using ML techniques, where it
extracts the major ML algorithms, features and evaluation metrics used
for this task. Several models from traditional ML models (Gyamerah
et al., 2020; Guo et al., 2021; Shahhosseini et al., 2020) to complex
deep learning (DL) models (Alibabaei et al., 2021; Shook et al., 2021;
Schwalbert et al., 2020; Wolanin et al., 2020; You et al., 2017) have
been successfully developed and proven their efﬁciency.
However, a good and powerful ML model requires equally good data
quality to generate quality predictions, where the data quality can be
affected by two factors, impurities and size. In our case, regrettably,
directorates and agricultural services in Algeria became aware of the im-
portance of recording the farming data, farmers' knowledge and
practices (including seeding, irrigation, fertilisation, soil components,
etc.), and their signiﬁcant role in enhancing the production and food
sustainability till the last few years. Therefore, the prediction process
in such a situation is challenging.

Fortunately, impurities in data, including noise, outliers, missing
data, duplicate data or any other anomalies, can be handled using data
cleansing methods. While one possible solution to solve the problem
of small data sets is data augmentation. This latter includes techniques
of increasing training data diversity without explicitly collecting new
data (Feng et al., 2021), in an attempt to improve the generalisation
ability of training models. For real-world data, generalisation is signiﬁ-
cant because it can help networks overcome small data sets (Olson
et al., 2018), and it is used to regularise and reduce over-ﬁtting when
training ML models (Shorten and Khoshgoftaar, 2019). The most widely
used data augmentation techniques involve either adding slightly mod-
iﬁed copies of existing data or creating synthetic ones (Shorten and
Khoshgoftaar, 2019).
Several artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) applications apply data augmenta-
tion in the case of small training data. In computer vision and pattern
recognition for generating more labelled data, where techniques like
cropping, ﬂipping, and colour jittering are standard components of
model training (Feng et al., 2021). In natural language processing
(NLP), in this case, techniques of interpolation and rule-based are
applied to augment patterns (Feng et al., 2021). In addition to time se-
ries classiﬁcation based on techniques of random transformation
(Iwana and Uchida, 2021).
Agricultural applications based on computer vision like crop classiﬁ-
cation, diseases and weed detection also used data augmentation based
on techniques to artiﬁcially increase the number of images in hand
based on ideas of (rotation, light shade's variation, colour inversion,
translation, improving the resolution and changes in intensity and so
on) (Arsenovic et al., 2019; Aravind and Raja, 2020; Chen et al., 2019;
Kamal et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2017; Sladojevic et al., 2016; Yamamoto
et al., 2017). Yet, this solution is not applicable to crop yield forecasting.
Transfer learning is another alternative solution for increasing small
data set, where the knowledge obtained from solving a task in a given
domain is transferred to the target domain (Aravind and Raja, 2020;
Barbedo, 2018; Cruz et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2018). But, this solution
can be effective if the source and target domains share certain similari-
ties; and if we initially have a good model for the source domain, which
is not always possible.
In this work, we address the problem of crop yield forecasting and
the performance of ML methods in the presence of small data sets
where we use data augmentation techniques to increase the data sets
and enhance the performance of ML models. In which we conduct a
comparative study using ML regression models, such as Support Vector
Regression (SVR), Random Forest regression (RF), Artiﬁcial Neural
Network (ANN), Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and Deep Neural
Network (DNN), under three experimental scenarios by evaluating the
performances achieved by the different methods.
2. Related works
ML and DL techniques are of increased use to estimate different crop
yields. (Elavarasan et al., 2018) discuss the yield estimation by integrat-
ing agrarian factors in ML techniques. Besides, several works have been
proposed to estimate crop yield using ML (Abbas et al., 2020; Guo et al.,
2021; Ji et al., 2021; Piekutowska et al., 2021; Rahman and Robson,
2020; Rezapour et al., 2021; Shahhosseini et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020)
and others have been used DL models (Alibabaei et al., 2021; Cao
et al., 2021; Gong et al., 2021; Nevavuori et al., 2020; Shook et al.,
2021; Schwalbert et al., 2020).
(Chergui et al., 2020) demonstrate possible applications of ML and
DL for crop management, including crop yield forecasting. They distin-
guish two trends for crop estimation; the ﬁrst one is related to data
sources that directly affect the crops(soil data, weather data, environ-
mental parameter data). These are typically used to offer a pre-season
estimate of crop yield (Crane-Droesch, 2018; Ehret et al., 2011;
Fukuda et al., 2013; Gonzalez-Sanchez et al., 2014; Gyamerah et al.,
2020; Kouadio et al., 2018). The second trend is related to the data
sources' collected using advanced technologies and tools such as
multi-spectral and hyper-spectral satellite images, remote sensing and
sensors. These are usually applied to provide in-season predictions of
crop yields (Ji et al., 2017; Maimaitijiang et al., 2020; Pantazi et al.,
2016; You et al., 2017). Where other studies use both types of data
sources (Abbas et al., 2020; Filippi et al., 2019; Han et al., 2020; Jeong
et al., 2016; Kim et al., 2019; Kamir et al., 2020; Oliveira et al., 2018;
Schwalbert et al., 2020; Sakamoto, 2020).
Other proposed studies used data augmentation via the aggregation
of different small data sets for crop yield forecasting. Among others, we
found the work of (Meroni et al., 2021) which predicted the monthly
yield of three types of cereals at the national level, where it integrated
data sets by crop from all provinces and added an identiﬁer for each
Province as an additional predictor variable. (Filippi et al., 2019) com-
bined data on three types of cereals over multiple ﬁelds and years into
one data set. Then they created three separate models based on factors
like (pre-sowing, mid-season and late-season conditions); to study the
effect of the availability of within-season information on the predictive
ability of their models. They created a single model for the three crops
and included the crop type as a predictor variable. In our study, we inte-
grate small data sets from two Provinces to form a more considerable
base for training. Rather than creating a single predictor for the two
Provinces, we seek to construct a speciﬁc predictor for each one that
better corresponds to its speciﬁcity.
In Table 1, we resume and compare recent works on forecasting crop
yield, where we focus on the ﬁrst trend that used to offer a pre-season
estimate of crop yield.
3. Material and methods
3.1. Region and crop selection
The study was carried out in two sites: the Province of Constantine
and the Province of Setif 1 (see Fig. 1). Constantine is located in the
northeast of Algeria; at latitude: 36.2833 and Longitude: 6.61667, 36∘
16′ 60” North and 6∘ 37′ 0″ East, and it has a Mediterranean climate.
Setif's latitude: 36.15 and longitude: 5.43333, 36∘ 11′ 28.03” North and
5∘ 24′ 49.43″ East, it has a semi-arid climate.
These regions are known for the cultivation of cereals. The crop cho-
sen for this study is durum wheat because it presents the most impor-
tant crop and occupies the amplest agricultural area. The cropped
wheat in both regions is rainfed or not irrigated.
3.2. Data sources
We have obtained historical data on durum wheat yields from the
Department of Agricultural Services of the Province of Constantine1
and the Province of Setif,2 data is not available online. The yield data ob-
tained for the Province of Constantine covers the seasons from 1991 to
2019 and starting from 2005 to 2020 for the Province of Setif. The two
data sets contain information on the recorded annual yields and the
acreage; they present the crop yield as the harvested production of a
crop per unit of the harvested area, measured in metric quintals per
hectare (q/ha). However, they do not provide information on geo-
graphic identiﬁcation, soil nature and components or fertilisation pro-
grams.
Additionally, we used climatic data obtained from different sources,
initially from the principal used source,3 that archives meteorological
data at airports of the provinces of Constantine and Setif. However,
this site offers downloadable data only from February 2005; therefore,
we have got the weather data from 2005 to 1996 from a second source.4

Due to the scarcity of meteorological data for the pre-1996 period,
we have reduced the study interval for the province of Constantine
from 1996 to 2019.
The climatic data from the ﬁrst source is rich and downloadable; it
offers daily-level records (at least three records per day). The second
source provides data from 1945 at the daily level, but it was hard to
reuse because it was not downloadable. Additionally, it includes only a
few features (air temperature, precipitation, wind and pressure); it con-
tains missing records for a few months. Thence, we selected attributes
in common between the two data sources (the monthly mean temper-
ature and the monthly mean precipitation) as predictor variables from
November to June for each year. It exists a national climate centre that
provides more detailed data and includes more expanded information
on solar radiation, humidity, pressure, wind, etc. Because of the absence
of agreements between the institutions, this data was helpless.
We used a third data source5 for the following purposes: to complete
the data for the missing months and to extract the relative air humidity
for the period before February 2005 to construct the data set used for
the second experiment. Data from this source is not directly download-
able.
Durum wheat is sown in autumn (from late October to November,
subject to autumn rainfall); harvesting acquires at the beginning of
summer (from June to July). Therefore, we collected climatic data
from November to May.
3.3. Data pre-processing
The historical yield data was complete with no missing data.
We obtained climatic data from different sources; therefore, we ﬁrst
extracted all the needed features and transformed them into a single
form. Next, we cleaned up the data from some redundant records.
Then, we imputed the rest of the missing records by using the median
approach. After that, we gathered and calculated the monthly means
of temperature, precipitation and relative humidity.
Later, we calculated the standard deviation (SD) of the yield time se-
ries in each zone and then deﬁned the observed values as outliers and
removed them if they were not within the range of ±3SD.
Finally, we normalised the data and deﬁned it into an identical scale
in the interval [0,1] using the min_max normalisation function.
3.4. AI models and evaluation metrics
To investigate how the data augmentation approach proposed in
this work can improve the accuracy of yield prediction, we conduct a
comprehensive set of experiments using the main types of AI regression
models for crop yield modelling. Based on the study by (Klompenburg
et al., 2020), which claimed that neural networks were the most used
and accurate tools for crop yield estimation, we selected the Extreme
Learning Machine (ELM), Artiﬁcial Neural Network (ANN) and Deep
Neural Network (DNN) as predictive models. In addition, we also test
the accuracy of the approach using some algorithms commonly used
for small data set: Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Regression
(SVR) (See Table 2).
We adjusted the hyper-parameters of each model by experiments;
the properties of neural network models like their structure, learning
rate and activation functions, in addition to those of RF and SVR.
Finally, we normalised the data and deﬁned it into an identical scale
in the interval [0, 1] using the min_max normalisation function.
Root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error
(MAPE), coefﬁcient of determination (R-squared or R2), mean absolute
error (MAE), and mean biased error (MBE) were the statistical parame-
ters used for evaluating the accuracy of the forecast.

3.5. Methods
ML algorithms, especially neural networks, are known to be
data-hungry; small data sets degrade their performance. Therefore,
forecasting crop yield using small data sets may not achieve high
accuracy.
After pre-processing the data, we obtained a data set containing 23
samples for the Province of Constantine and 14 samples for the Province
of Setif.
We are going to conduct three experiments under three different
data sets where the component of each one is as follows:
•
We ﬁrst refer by data-sets1, data-sets2 and data-sets3 to the data
sets used respectively for experiment1, experiment2 and experiment3;
•
We respectively refer by (data-set1A, zone-A) and (data-set1B,
zone-B) to the Province of Constantine and its data and the Province
of Setif and its data. Both data sets contain the mean monthly precipita-
tion and the mean monthly temperature;
•
Data-sets2 used for experiment2 is the data-sets1 enhanced by
an additional feature (the relative humidity) to improve the prediction's
accuracy by ﬁrst adding a new feature to data-sets. We built data-set2A
for zone-A and data-set2B for zone-B;
•
In experiment3, we merged data-set2A with data-set2B to build
data-set3 (data-set3A for zone-A and data-set3B for zone-B), the merg-
ing process will be discussed later (see Fig. 2).
We divided data sets into training data (70%) and test data (30%).
We chose this partition to obtain more cases to test the generation abil-
ity of the ML algorithms, therefore, to get more accurate results because
too little test data can lead to an optimistic estimation of the model's
performance. Then, we used three-fold cross-validation to train the
ML algorithms.
3.5.1. Data augmentation through merging of data sets
To increase the performance of models' predictions when only small
data sets are available, we augment raw versions of data-sets2 (with
humidity) used to train/test ML algorithms for the two zones (A and
B) by merging them to build a larger one (data-set3).
Then, we pre-processed the resulting data set (data-set3) by remov-
ing the outlier using ±3SD. After that, we normalise it using the
min-max function.
To get a more transparent comparison between the three
experiments, we keep the same test sets used for experiment1 and ex-
periment2. Therefore, we split data-set3 into three subsets: test-setA for
zone-A, test-setB for zone-B and train-setAB, and the training set for the
two zones, which means that we exclude test-setA and test-setB from
train-setAB.

Cross-validation is applied to train ML algorithms. To train models
for zone-A, we exclude the validation records of zone-B from its training
set and the same for training zone-B. In another sense, we adjust the
learning of the ML algorithm according to the target zone. Fig. 2 presents
the data augmentation process.
4. Results and discussions
4.1. Results
After implementing the ML models in Python using existing libraries
like the Scikit-Learn library, we obtained the results presented in Table 3
where the text in bold font indicates the best results for each metric in
each experiment. Generally observed, each of the regression methods:
ANN, DNN, ELM, RF and SVR, exhibited better performance for experi-
ment3 over the two other experiments for both zones in most cases.
Besides, they also showed better-to-comparable performance with
experiment2 and experiment1, while experiment2 (data with the addi-
tional feature) was favourable. Algorithms known to perform well with
larger data sets (ANN, DNN, RF, ELM) performed very well with exper-
iment3 for both zones. However, SVR showed weaknesses in
generalising high-quality estimates for all three experiments, especially
for experiment3 (zone-A). It is because SVR does not perform well with
high-dimensional data sets.

Furthermore, the best performance for durum wheat yield
prediction was observed when using augmented data (experiment3)
for both zones, achieving a (RMSE = 0.037 q/ha, MAPE = 5.9%, R2=
0.965) with DNN algorithm for zone A, and a (RMSE = 0.051 q/ha,
MAPE = 24.879%, R2= 0.835) with RF for zone-B, as shown in Table 3.
On the other hand, when increasing the number of input features
(experiment2), the evaluation metrics gradually improved (RMSE,
MAPE, MAE, MBE, R2) for almost all methods, especially for zone-B.
Indicates that all tested regression methods, to some extent, were able
to beneﬁt from the additional input feature. In addition, the relative
humidity feature has helped improve the prediction accuracy in many
cases.
However, ML methods such as ANN, RF and ELM outperformed DNN
regression when fewer input variables were available (experiment1
and experiment2). Conversely, DNN achieved higher performance
than other methods when a more signiﬁcant number of input variables
were available (augmented data of experiment3). It is because deep
learning often goes beyond ordinary machine learning models for larger
data sets (Maimaitijiang et al., 2020).
Bar chart that visualises performance of the evaluation metrics
(RMSE, MAPE, R2, MAE and MBE) of the ﬁve methods using the test
data are given in Fig. 3 for zone-A, and Fig. 4 for zone-B. When
predicting the yield of durum wheat using data sets of experiment1,
comparative to the ﬁve benchmark methods, it is evident that for
zone-A, ELM performed better in terms of RMSE, MAPE, MAE and R2.
Yet RF outperformed all the other models in terms of all metrics for
zone-B.
Moreover, we can observe that ANN, DNN and ELM performed very
well concerning all evaluation metrics when predicting the durum
wheat yield using data-set3A from experiment3 compared to RF and
SVR. In addition, we perceive that for zone-B, almost all methods
reached a high level of precision for RMSE, MAE, MBE and R2 (except
the DNN showed a bit of degradation with R2). RF outperformed other
methods in RMSE, R2 and MAE, while DNN surpassed them in MAPE
and MBE.
On the other side, if we take the MBE metric that explains the aver-
age amount by which the observation is greater than the prediction, and
allows us to see how much the model overestimates or underestimates.
We can perceive that the DNN model outperformed all the other models
for both zones. Also, there is an improvement in the value of MBE from
an underestimation in experiment1 to a slight overestimation in exper-
iment2. Besides, it reached a neglected level in experiment3 for both
zones, indicating that the DNN model in experiment3 for both zones is
not biased. If we look at an overview of all evaluation metrics; we can
observe that using data-set2A from experiment2 (with the additional
feature) does not improve the prediction accuracy for zone-A compared
to experiment1 regarding ANN and SVR methods, where DNN recorded
better performances but still exceeded by ELM.
However, for zone-B in experiment2, all methods performed better
than those in experiment1 in terms of all metrics. RF outperformed
other methods considering RMSE and MAE, and DNN performances'
surpassed those of the remaining algorithms in terms of R2, MAPE and
MBE. This fact conducts us to understand that the impact of the relative
humidity feature is more signiﬁcant for forecasting wheat grown in
zone-B (characterised by semi-arid climate) than zone-A (characterised
by Mediterranean climate).
5. Discussions
For a clearer vision, we further investigate the relationship between
relative humidity and yield using the Partial Dependence Plots (PDP)
along with the Individual Conditional Expectation plots (ICE) to visual-
ise the marginal effect of relative humidity on yield prediction and the
dependence between them for both zones.
But since there is an average correlation between the relative
humidity and rainfall (knowing that correlation = 0.37 for zone-A,
correlation = 0.43 for zone-B), PDP may become a misleading. To
overcome this limitation, we used the Accumulated Local Effects (ALE)
plot, an unbiased model that describes how much the feature inﬂuences
the prediction of an ML model.
The Figs. 5, 6 show two PDP, ICE and ALE plots for zone-A and zone-
B, with a RF regressor.
The PDPs in Figs. 5a and 6a respectively depict the average effect of
the relative humidity on the yield for zone-A and zone-B. We can ob-
serve that an increase in the relative humidity increases the yield
value until reaching some levels where it becomes steady (from 0.55
for zone-A and 0.68 for zone-B). Besides, the effect of relative humidity
on zone-B is more signiﬁcant than its inﬂuence on zone-A; this is evi-
dent when we look at the size of the change in the yield. Through the
curve of zone-A, we notice that the amplitude of variation is equal to
0.035, which is considered negligible compared to 0.20 of zone-B.
The ICE plots are presented in Figs. 5b and 6b, in which the dashed
lines in the plots correspond to the PDP line that overlaid on ICE lines
(each sample of the feature has a separate line). These plots highlight

the dependence of the prediction on a feature for each entry separately.
These ICE plots conﬁrm the previous observation where we can see that
in zone-A, several samples have ﬂat shapes to little curved, whilst in
zone-B, all instances have curved shapes. This indicates that relative hu-
midity is more relevant for predictions of zone-B than zone-A.
Figs. 5c and 6c showed the ALE plots for zone-A and zone-B. These
plots are zero-centred which signiﬁes the mean prediction, and then
the value at each point of the ALE curve is the difference from this
mean. The higher the difference is, the higher the effects of the feature
on the yield prediction. Accordingly, we conclude that the inﬂuence of

relative humidity on yield prediction of zone-B is more signiﬁcant than
for zone-A.
6. Limitation and perspectives
The data augmentation approach has remarkably helped improve
the quality of predictions for many models. This fact is not due only to
larger data sets, but the latter may contain additional information and
varieties in weather conditions with different intrinsic yield potential,
and this variety would be a necessary predictor variable (Filippi et al.,
2019). The drawback of this study is that we used the entire Province
(an aggregation of several scattered ﬁelds and farms) without consider-
ing sub-regional spatial variability (Pham et al., 2022), resulting from
climatic factors, the different topography and soil nature. In addition,
various farmers manage these ﬁelds following different technical
paths for seeding, harvesting and so on. Therefore, although we did
not use most of this information in this study because of their unavail-
ability, weather data taken at one station per Province are irrelevant
for some ﬁelds and may affect the models' output. Therefore, if we
had accurate climate variable information and ground-truth data at
the ﬁeld level within each Province, we could likely get more data points
that would automatically increase the data set and possibly improve the
accuracy of results.
Furthermore, the ﬁeld-level information would allow us to use
remote sensing images derived from satellite sensors like sentinel-2. It
would make it possible to provide temperature values closer to the ac-
tual one on the farm compared to the employed values, which describe
a sensed temperature that may be very far from several ﬁelds and farms
within the same Province.
On the other hand, it would permit us to use additional variables like
vegetation indices which have proven their efﬁciency in enhancing pre-
diction accuracy (Maimaitijiang et al., 2020; Abbas et al., 2020; Filippi
et al., 2019; Han et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2019; Kamir et al., 2020;
Oliveira et al., 2018; Schwalbert et al., 2020; Sakamoto, 2020).
Another potentially obtained beneﬁt from the availability of ﬁeld-
level information is the exploration of other deep learning models like
CNN for yield forecasting using the sensed images. Additionally, the
exploitation of data augmentation techniques used for image classiﬁca-
tion purposes to augment the data size of samples if needed (Arsenovic
et al., 2019; Aravind and Raja, 2020). Besides, image-based deep learn-
ing approaches can employ spectral, spatial, and temporal information
from satellite data and may reduce the need for feature engineering
(Sagan et al., 2021).

7. Conclusion
To solve the problem of crop yield estimation in the presence of data
scarcity and its impacts on forecasting quality, we conducted an ap-
proach to predicting the yield of durum wheat using only two climatic
variables for two different provinces in Algeria.
The method was to increase the size and dimension of the data.
Firstly, we increased the dimension of the initial data by adding a new
climatic feature. Secondly, we augmented its size by merging data sets
from the two provinces to create a more signiﬁcant input. Next, we per-
formed extensive experiments to study the effects of data size and select
the best model, particularly to examine and test the effectiveness of the
data augmentation-by-merging approach. We carried out a comprehen-
sive comparison of ﬁve major AI regression models based on the three
different data sets for the two provinces. Then, we proposed a cross-
validation training/test process to learn algorithms to develop the best
model for crop yield prediction. As a result, we achieved the best perfor-
mance when utilising data augmentation-by-merging data sets for both
Provinces. While the DNN model employed for the ﬁrst Province
outperformed the other four AI models, the RF model outperformed
the related models for the second Province.
The data augmentation approach proposed in this study has shown
promising results and can be adopted in other regions or for other
crops. In addition, the suggested method is generic, allowing it to be ap-
plied to other agricultural applications or for other ﬁelds where data is
scarce.
