Abstract 
Large coal-fired power generation is a complex process characterized as nonlinear and coupling 
correlation between the levels of equipment, subsystems and function modules. It is therefore difficult to 
describe the energy-consumption behaviour and optimize the operation parameters under different operation 
conditions and boundary conditions with conventional methods. With data mining methods such as Support 
Vector Regression (SVR) and Genetic Algorithm (GA), a huge amount of practical operation data stored in 
the plant-level Supervisory Information System (SIS) were used to model the energy consumption and 
optimize the operation parameters for less coal consumption.  The results show that the power coal rate 
reduced significantly under the combination of SVR and GA. The optimal operation program has a practical 
feasibility, and the whole optimizing process can supply model basis for large coal-fired power units.

1  Introduction 
Large coal-fired power unit is a complex nonlinear system with more uncertainties to describe the 
energy-consumption behaviour, evaluate the coal rate for power generation and optimize the practical 
operation. The operation optimization problem can be described as Model (1), which consists of two parts: a 
optimum target such as the highest power efficiency or the minimum coal consumption, and a couple of 
constraints such as the power load, coal quality, ambient factors and operation conditions. The expression of 
such optimization problem is explicit but it is difficult to determine the optimal targets in operation 
optimization of power units, especially considering the varying boundary constraints, operation conditions 
and system features.

 are the constraint conditions demonstrating the ambient and operation

Commonly used optimal targets mainly cover the designed values from the fabricants of power 
equipment, the test benchmark conducted on site and the calculation results based on mathematic modelling 
of power units. There are several limitations of these methods such as low efficiency, inexplicit description 
and local optimization features; in addition, they are frequently impracticable, costly and time-consumed, for 
a power unit is a complex nonlinear system with more uncertainties to describe, evaluate and optimize for 
different boundary and operational conditions.  
The increasing development of measuring, monitoring and information technologies strive a highway for 
the operation optimization of power units including data processing, uncertainty measuring, intelligent 
modelling and expert system building[2~5]. Clustering and fuzzy associated rules-based methods are used in 
process control and individual parameter optimization such as excessive air flow and boiler efficiency[2,5]; 
neural network (NN) and SVR methods are introduced to model the NOX emission of the coal-fired boiler and 
the operation parameters are optimized with ant colony optimization algorithm (ACO) and GA method. This 
made a reference for the operation optimization of power plants. 
In this paper, SVR and GA are used to model the coal consumption behaviour and determine the 
optimum value of operation parameters. GA shows its priorities in two sides: to select the modelling 
parameters of SVR[4] and to optimize a set of key operation parameters to obtain the optimum values, at which 
the coal rate for power generation falls into the least under different operation conditions.

2.1   Overview on Support Vector Regression  
As an emerging technology of data mining, support vector machine (SVM) was originally proposed by 
Vapnik in 1990s to solve the classification problem, which is based on the VC principle and structure risk 
minimization principles[3]  With a substantial foundation and systematic reasoning; SVR is of the favourable 
features in unique solution, global optimization and strong generalization. SVR   problem is described as:

 In SVR model, there are three factors, i. e. the type of kernel function, kernel function parameter and 
punish coefficient, dramatically affecting the accuracy, complexity and generalization ability of the model 
built with SVR. For this, it is important to select and optimize the above parameters[4]. 
2.2   Overview on Genetic Algorithm 
GA is one of the optimization algorithms, which is derived from Darwin's genetic choice and biological 
evolution process of natural selection. GA is a global optimization algorithm with strong commonality, 
robustness and promising applications in machine learning, process control, economic forecast and 
optimization[9~10]. It consists of the following 7 main components: string coding, initialization, fitness function, 
selection operation, crossover operation, mutation operation and stop criterion.  
2.3 GA-based  model parameter selection and operation optimization 
As shown in Figure 1, GA is introduced in this paper for both the parameter selection of SVR model and 
the optimization of operation parameters. The optimization process includes the following six steps: 
Step 1
Initial parameter Settings. Preset GA algorithm population scale, selection operation, crossover 
operation and mutation operation and termination evolution algebra. Choose operation selection scale 
selection operator, crossover operation using single point crossover operator, mutation operation use basic for 
mutation operator. 
Step 2
Coding and the generation of initial population. According to stay optimization parameter , C, 
 and operation parameters of the optimal interval and precision requirements, to determine to optimize 
parameters of the chromosome length, the parameters are binary coding.
