Abstract
The ability to control data and information through the Internet can be challenging. Pre-
liminary analysis showed that some tampering and forgery may occur to some words of the Quran
in the electronic versions that span the Internet. Such small modiﬁcations may not be noticed by
public audience. The holy book of Quran includes a unique feature in that its worldwide copies
are all identical. The 114 chapters (Suras) and all their verses and words are preserved in the exact
form. As such, we designed and evaluated a model and a tool to evaluate the integrity of the word-
ing in the e-versions of the Quran through generating a Meta data related to all words in the Quran
preserving the counts and locations. Such Meta data can be used in the same way hash algorithms
are used in security to check the integrity of a disk and its data ﬁles where any small change in the
data will result in a different hash value. We conducted several experiments to evaluate the different
parameters and challenges that can impact the automatic authentication process of Quranic verses
based on information retrieval and hashing algorithms.

1. Introduction
With the huge amount of information uploaded by users all
over the world, internet is the central library that all humans
in the world are using to exchange information. However,
one of the major problems with the current web is that there
is no control on the type, nature or details of information
uploaded to the web by any user. Accordingly, credibility
and accuracy are the foremost concerns when reading informa-
tion from the web. Credibility can be linked to the website,
hosting the information, author of uploaded data and the type
of data or information itself. For example, in social networks
or even news websites the same story can be told in exactly
opposite versions given by two different websites or authors.
Authenticity and integrity of online documents is increas-
ingly getting crucial as many organizations put their docu-
ments online. Providing facilities that allow both documents’
owners and viewers to be able to ensure that their documents
are authentic and not tampered is extremely important.
Currently two major techniques or approaches are used to
authenticate documents, or users online: Document control

and digital signatures. Document control is related to permis-
sions before and after publishing the document online. Docu-
ment control then is needed to be dynamically applied in a
manner that document can be tracked even after publishing
it online. Integrity is about making sure that the document is
not altered by any unauthorized person and hence is authenti-
cated. In digital signatures, signed documents should be veri-
ﬁed by the people who signed it (i.e. non-repudiation).
Nowadays, many multilingual copies of the holy Quran are
available online. The holy Quran is originally written in Arabic
language. The exact wording and statements in Quran verses
are identical for all Arabic versions of the Quran.1 However,
one problem with translation is that it may change, intention-
ally or unintentionally the meaning of some verses when trans-
lated to another language. This is a general problem when
dealing with translation. On the other hand, for the same lan-
guage, it is possible that the same verse be written in different
words due to intentional fraud or due to language translation
issues.
Due to the sensitivity and the nature of Quran verses there
is a vital need to continuously monitor Quran verses and chap-
ters written through the Internet websites and pages to make
sure that they are authenticated and not changed or fraud.
Hashing algorithms or checksums are used to verify the
integrity of data in ﬁles, disks and databases. The hashing
algorithms or tools take ﬁle or data as inputs and generate a
unique decimal or hexadecimal number in a way where any
small change that may occur to the data in the ﬁle will cause
the hashing algorithm to produce a new random number that
is different from the previous number that was generated
before the modiﬁcation. The Holy Quran is reserved and inte-
grated in all its chapters and verses word by word and letter by
letter. Hence using hashing algorithms to check automatically
and frequently whether there is any possible modiﬁcation can
be an effective tool to authenticate Quran electronic versions
either for the whole Quran version or in parts: chapters or
verses. Accordingly, Hashing can be generated for the whole
Quran as one unit, chapter by chapter or even verse by verse.
Fig. 1 below shows an example for hashing codes using the
verse:
Removing one letter from the verse may cause all hash val-
ues to be changed to totally new values.
As shown in Fig. 1, different hashing algorithms generate
different hashing values for the same verse. Moreover, hashing
algorithms do not differentiate between small and large modi-
ﬁcation. Any tiny modiﬁcation will change the hash codes just
like a large modiﬁcation.
The identity and integrity of the data must be periodically
and systematically veriﬁed through mechanisms such as Secure
Hash Standard (SHS) and Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) [1].
Quran verses can be considered plagiarized or unauthenticated
even for one letter change. Hence, hash algorithms are good
option as such algorithms are very sensitive even for a very
small change in data or documents.
In this paper, an online integrity and authentication system
for the Quran is proposed. The goal of such system is to con-
tinuously traverse and search information and web pages
throughout the Internet for any possible intentional and unin-
tentional Quran verses fraud or change.
It should be mentioned that in this research we are not
focusing on encryption but rather integrity checking. The prob-
lem is that in our scenario for Quranic documents online, the
relation between information providers and readers is not a
typical e-commerce one-to-one relation in which typical hash
or encryption algorithms can be sent to the known receiver or
customer. Accordingly, private keys intended for a particular
receiver will not be applicable in our scenario where the tool
is expected to check quickly through the Internet that Quranic
documents are authentic and do not contain tampering.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 dis-
cusses the related work to this research ﬁeld followed by a dis-
cussion of the adopted methodology in Section 3. Section 4
discusses the developed authentication system, while the exper-
iments are presented and discussed in Section 5. Section 6 pre-
sents the conclusion and future work.
1.1. Tashkeel, Harakat, or Diacritic marks
A unique aspect in Arabic is the addition of Diacritic marks or
Tashkeel symbols (smallﻭ, smallﺃ, smallﻱ, Tanween:
,
stress or shaddah). Those are added to letters to give different
meanings or ways of spelling letters. They may cause problems
to indexing and querying of data in cases whether those
Diacritics are added or ignored. We will present few of the
proposed solutions to handle Tashkeel in Arabic.
Papers that tried to detect Diacritics proposed morpholog-
ical rules to do that. Known patterns and an initial training set
are used to match subject word for one of the morphological
rules. Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is used where the hid-
den states are the possible diacritized selections of the words.
In Arabic text, Diacritic marks can be challenging whether
they exist or not in the Arabic text. If they exist, the challenge
will be to read or parse them correctly especially as they need
extra resources in addition to typical letters parsing in all other
languages. On the other hand, Diacritic marks are necessary to
Arabic words to clarify words and statements from ambiguity.

impact the integrity checking process and hence we either use one
reading or have different integrity datasets for the different readings.
Experiments in this papers use ‘‘Hafs” reading.

Letters in Arabic have different forms based on their loca-
tion, accordingly, indexer needs to understand that: (ﺇ,ﺃ,ﺁ) are
all forms of the same letter. Fig. 2 shows a sample of a Sphinx
table of Unicode character set that can be used as part of an
indexer to guide the indexer for letters of different forms.
The goal here is to acknowledge that many Arabic letters have
different forms and hence a Unicode character table needs to
have equivalent forms of similar letters. As mentioned earlier
such issues are solved technically once the right encoding
scheme is used.
2. Related work
While the subject of data or information integrity is not new,
few research papers are published in the area of web docu-
ments integrity veriﬁcation. This is particularly true if we want
to exclude papers discussing encryption approaches.
The removal of online documents’ replication is discussed
in [2]. In many cases, the exact document is published in more
than one website. This may not be related to plagiarism but to
copies replication. This is actually quite common in the Inter-
net world. The work presented in [2] used hashing comparison
to discover and remove possible replication in web documents.
The aim was to improve indexer optimization where one copy
of the document will be stored if many documents have the
exact same hash value.
The digital Quran veriﬁcation and authentication is very
rare; an algorithm to verify the fundamental text for Quranic
quotes is presented in [3]. In order to generate a standard form
of Quran verses, the algorithm is stemming some of the special
Arabic characters [3] that may make the comparison process
difﬁcult. This includes Harakat or Tashkeel that can change
the letters’ spelling and the different shapes for some letters
as well. While removing such symbols can facilitate the infor-
mation retrieval processes, they may cause false alarms where
some plagiarism may only occur in those parts which will then
be missed or not detected. The work in [3] did not specify any
limit or range to consider verses as not authenticated. It used
Information retrieval and language processing methods with
no utilization of security such as hashing methods.
A system to verify the authenticity of Quranic verses based
on Unicode comparison is presented in [4]. The algorithm
adopted in this system uses the Unicode representation of
the characters to verify the fundamental text against the orig-
inal Unicode text of the Quran in order to authenticate the
fundamental text of the Quranic quotation, and then the posi-
tion of diacritics and Tashkeel are veriﬁed. A similar study that
used unicode centric string matching approach is presented in
[8].
Sbbah and Selamat [9] have developed a framework for
Quranic verses authenticity detection in online forum. They
used a numerical approach to detect Quran quotes. The
numerical approach calculates the diacritical ratio (DR) of
each word in the text. Their authentication system depends
on deﬁning the weights of Quranic letters and diacritics and
calculate the identiﬁers of distinctive Quranic words.
Yusoff et al. [5] discussed authentication in Hadeeth and
used the historical traditional methods used to authenticate
Hadeeths in current digital evidence authentication. Writers
and collectors of Hadeeths used to follow the sequence or
chain of Hadeeths authors and check their authenticity one
by one. A deﬁciency in one member of the chain may weaken
the whole chain and the Hadeeth itself.
In order to protect the digital Quran from any distortion or
tampering, the work presented in [6] used the meta-codiﬁcation
where an ‘‘atomization structure” and Unicode codiﬁcation is
used on the Quran in terms of the number of verses in each
chapter, the number of characters in each verse and so on.
Other research works as in [7] discussed the usage of digital
signatures to authenticate information or documents through
the web. This can work in e-commerce applications and emails
where the typical two ways of communication exists between
either sender and receiver or client–server. However, in our
case, such architecture does exist and hence such methods can-
not be used to check whether the information or the document
was tampered or not. In Quran verses veriﬁcation system, an
authenticated copy of content is preserved and web content
is surveyed for possible – different copies. It is also important
to distinguish some changes related to Tashkeel, fonts, etc.
that should not be classiﬁed as tampering. In particular we
mean that some versions of the Quran include Tashkeel or
Dialects and others do not. Hence comparison should take this
into consideration.
In another but related domain, speech recognition tech-
niques are used to verify Quran recitation as we started seeing
many recitation applications which require new techniques to
verify the validity of the recitation, see for example [10–12].
In our case, the goal is to use information retrieval tech-
niques to look for documents that include unauthenticated
Quranic verses. Authentication algorithms are then required
to check whether these millions of documents online have
the same – literally authenticated versions of the Quran. Of
course such algorithms have two possibly contradictory
requirements: performance and accuracy. Algorithms should
be able to search through the Internet for possible frauds with
a high accuracy and quick speed. False alarms may also arise
due to issues such as different readings of the Quran where
some speciﬁc letters or words are different from one reading
to another.

Quran verses. Since Quran verses are literally identical, we
developed an authentication system that will index verses
one by one in its indexer and will frequently search any possi-
ble – mutation in the verses. The authentication system will be
able to frequently search the Internet for web pages that may
include such fraud verses and index them for monitoring, alert,
logging and veriﬁcation.
Similar to the concept of kids safe search that some search
engines used to limit or focus kids search on kids related web-
sites and eliminate websites that may present or contain harm-
ful content to kids, our proposed system should be able to
retrieve results for only authenticated versions of Quran verses.
Our research methodology consists of three main steps (see
Fig. 2):
1. Selecting a hashing algorithm: MD5 hashing algorithm has
been chosen as it is a common and reliable one (see section
experiments and discussions).
2. Developing of the authentication system: the authentica-
tion system has been developed using C# programming lan-
guage, ASP.NET. This can be classiﬁed as a customized
information retrieval or crawling system.
The details of developing the authentication system are dis-
cussed in more detail in Section 4. The goal of this research is
to design a search engine or authentication system that is able
to retrieve results based on a search query. A customized
Quran search engine or information retrieval system should
focus on parsing and indexing Quran verses from all over
the web. For proposed program search user interface and
queries will then represent verses or part of verses.
The proposed Quranic search engine website allows the
search through the whole internet and retrieves links where
the searched verses are located. The focus in this paper is to
propose and design a system that can search for and index cor-
rect and incorrect versions of Quranic verses that may exist
throughout the Internet.
The algorithm to develop the authentication system is
shown in Fig. 3. The authentication system will start by check-
ing whether the verse is written with Harakat and Tashkeel or
not to decide which version of the Quran to search. Then the
algorithm will look for the verses that are similar to the verse
in question; some verses or part of them can be replicated in
the Quran. The verses that have perfect match (similar-
ity = 100%) or verses that are partially match (similar-
ity P 70%) are selected to authenticate the verse in question.
Then, the hash code for the verse in question is generated
and compared to the selected verses. If the hash code of one
or more verses is identical to the hash code of the verse in ques-
tion then the verse is authenticated, otherwise the verse is
tampered.
4. Quran authentication system development
We have conducted an experiment to evaluate the top websites
that are used to search for Quranic verses. This is based on the
popular search engine Google. We built a customized crawler
to search through Google for Quran verses one by one from
the ﬁrst to the last verse. For each verse, we collected informa-
tion related to the approximate number of index pages in Goo-
gle for the verse. This represents the approximate number for
web or Internet links that include the queried verse. The devel-
oped crawler uses Quran verses as search queries. Results are
retrieved from embedded information in search web pages.
Meta data related to the retrieved web pages are collected
and saved in a dataset. Google ranks retrieved results based
on its popularity page rank algorithm.
Fig. 4 shows a small sample of the collected data. We col-
lected the ﬁrst 10 links that are retrieved from Google search
which indicate the most visited websites for the speciﬁc verse.
The number of indexed pages in Google is approximate, see
Fig. 5, where this can be a direct indicator of the verse popu-
larity. Quranic digitally published verses can be indexed as part
of the whole Quran in some websites that include the whole
Quran chapters and verses. In some other cases, some chapters
or verses of the Quran may be indexed or included in some
pages as part of non-Quranic text.
In order to deal with the verses having Harakat and Tash-
keel, we have considered two versions of the Quran: one that
considers Harakat or Tashkeel and one that does not. Quran
indexed in the web can be with or without Tashkeel. In many
cases, search engines and their queries can be sensitive to these
symbols that are unique in Arabic language; hence a search for
verse that does not include Tashkeel in the query may not
retrieve results for verses that include Tashkeel symbols.
While there are some authentic websites such as www.is-
lamweb.net, www.alro7.net, www.alhawali.com, many of the
popular websites in the ﬁrst search page or the top 10 pages
are either from non-Islamic resources, or from some websites
that do not represent the main stream of Islam and that may
include inaccurate information, content or interpretation of
these verses. We consider that the Internet is now the main
source for searching for Quran verses and their interpretation
not only for Muslims, but also for non-Muslims. Popular
social network websites such as Facebook and YouTube are
listed frequently as sources for Quranic verses. It is not clear
however why Google is presenting them in the top 10 retrieved
results. It is possibly that such high rank is not based on the
popularity of the speciﬁc Facebook personal page or the speci-
ﬁc YouTube video, but rather based on the popularity of the
mother website (i.e. YouTube or Facebook).
Fig. 5 shows top 20 verses based on Google indexed pages
that are popular. This is accomplished after indexing almost
the ﬁrst half of the Quran. Fig. 5 shows that the number of
Quran indexed verses may vary from one verse to another
and from one chapter to another. The ﬁrst most popular verse
of the Quran is AlBasmalah (ﺑﺴﻢﺍﻟﻠﻪﺍﻟﺮﺣﻤﻦﺍﻟﺮﺣﻴﻢ). In fact this
verse can be used in many contexts not necessary part of citing
Quranic verses. People may use it to start a book, a chapter or
a process. The verses in the ﬁrst chapter are also popular for
almost the same reasons. Some short verses can get a large
number of indexed links as such short verse may be used in
non-Quranic contexts (see Fig. 6).

For the Quran authentication system to work properly, we
built an indexer that includes all Quran verses (based on the
version available on the Islamweb website) where each line
or row in the indexer includes one verse. Information about
each verse should include its chapter, sequence number, con-
tent and number of characters and MD5 hash value. MD5
hash value is saved as the hash table value besides the verse
as a key object, see Fig. 7.
Total hash items are 6236 to represent total Quran verses.
Fig. 8 shows a small screenshot from Quran indexer includ-
ing the attributes described earlier.
5. Experiments and discussions
In this section, several experiments are discussed, some of them
helped us in making decisions related to the hashing algorithm
in developing the authentication system and at the end we have
conducted some experiments to test our authentication system.
As mentioned earlier, there are several challenges that may
face the process of authenticating automatically electronic
verses and chapters of the noble Quran. Such challenges are
related to different languages, fonts, styles, and Quranic read-

ings. Accordingly, we want ﬁrst to evaluate whether such dif-
ferences can be handled by hashing algorithms or not.
In the ﬁrst study, we have selected an experimental case
study of several different verses, different fonts, colors, and
occurrences of small editing or changes and see their hashing
values using different hashing algorithms.
We want to see ﬁrst whether Tashkeels may impact hashing
algorithms. Fig. 9(a and b) shows different hash algorithm val-
ues for the same small part of Tashkeel
Bytes conversion gave the same value for the part of the
verse with and without Tashkeel as Tashkeel values are not
recognized by the conversion. This byte value can be then used
for veriﬁcation if Tashkeel is to be ignored. All the evaluated
hashing algorithms including the following: Alder32, CRC32,
Haval, MD2, MD4, MD5, RipeMD128, RipeMD160, SHA-
1, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, Tiger, and Whirlpool gave
different values for the verses with and without Tashkeels.
We repeated the process several times and noticed that all
hashing algorithms for all evaluated verses show different hash
values comparing with and without Harakat or Tashkeel. We
noticed however, that different implementations for the same
hashing algorithm may give different hash values for the same
text. As such, the system should use the same algorithm imple-
mentation for initial and consecutive authentications or veriﬁ-
cations. This is what we have done in developing the
authentication system where we used the MD5 hashing algo-
rithm for hashing purposes.
We also tried some small changes related to using for exam-
ple (ﻩ) instead of (ﺓ) and all hashing algorithms showed
different values.
This simple experiment showed that if we want to check
correctness or authenticity of verses with Tashkeel and exact
form, hashing algorithms can be used. However, if we want
to stem those parts, hashing algorithms will not be then effec-
tive unless those additions are stemmed from all verses. In the
second experiment and in order to check whether same hash
functions can produce same hash codes, we tried different
implementations for the same hashing algorithm and check
hash values for several verses. We believe that verse should
be the standard unit to measure with. Sizes of smaller or larger
than a verse can have several issues and challenges specially
related to false alarms.
In this experiment we have ﬁxed the source of Quran text to
one website, in this case, (http://quran.com). First, we evalu-
ated using MD5 hashing from three websites: http://www.ﬁle-
format.info referred to (Hash1), http://www.hashemall.com
referred to (Hash2) and http://www.md5hashgenerator.com
referred to (Hash3). Table 1 shows results of three samples
using verses with Tashkeel.
Results showed inconsistent ﬁndings where two algorithms
gave exact hash values (ignoring letter cases) unlike the third
one.
Table 2 shows same verses and same implementations for
the verses but without Tashkeel. All values are different from

those of Table 1 as Tashkeel changed hash values. On the other
hand, Hash 2 and 3 gave same values (ignoring letter cases).
This experiment shows that not all hashing functions are
identical or should always produce same hash values for same
text. Nonetheless, this is not due to reliability issue with hash-
ing algorithms. Rather, it has to do with the detail implemen-
tation of the hashing algorithm. Hashing values for the same
algorithm implementation for the same text should always pro-
duce same hash values.
Table 3 shows results of changing text size and font. All
three MD5 implementations gave same results and were not
impacted with changing verse font type or size.
As a summary of hashing experiments, we found that the
authentication systems including the indexer should be devel-
oped using the same hash function. This is since values of dif-
ferent hashing algorithms for the same exact verse may result
or display different hashing values.
We decided to consider MD5 hashing algorithm due to its
popularity and reliability. As mentioned earlier, it was impor-
tant to select only one hashing algorithm as each algorithm
produces different hashes in comparison with the others for
the same verses (see Tables 4 and 5).
We have used our authentication system to check one of the
online copies of the Holy Quran available in one of the Arabic
websites that index Arabic books and documents (The compre-
hensive library: http://shamela.ws/), and we noticed that there
are records of some Quranic distortion in some verses. The risk
is that such versions may be exposed to non-Muslims or Mus-
lims who have little experience of the exact wording of Quran
verses.
One popular example of this is a popular program called
(Qaloon). At least one version of this program is discovered
with examples of incorrect verses’ wording. Following are
examples of the incorrect wording of some verses and their
correct ones. We also included hashing values for both cases
to simply show that an automatic hash based algorithm can
easily detect such distortion.
Things to notice in the results:
1. Hash can detect distortion even in dialects or Tashkeels.
2. Hash values are randomly generated. Hence one difference
may result in a completely different hash. Hence the idea is
not to see how much the text is far from the actual text. The
idea is to come up with a Boolean decision: Version is iden-
tical relative to the original authenticated copy or not.
3. One of the serious issues through the Internet is that if we
search using the incorrect versions that Qaloon program
used, you will see thousands of websites indexing these
incorrect versions.
Qaloon is not the only program that had such incident.
Another program called ‘‘ﺍﻟﺒﺎﺣﺚ”
included some incorrect
verses. Results showed that both showed completely different
hashes.

6. Conclusion and future work
With the current continuous expansion of Internet information
and services, authentication and credibility of users and infor-
mation through the web is vital. For the holy Quran book in
particular, authentication is very critical. The authenticity
and originality of verses in the digital media can be challenging
especially as it is required to be accomplished in high agile and
quick manners. In this paper, we proposed an approach to
implement Quranic authentication system based on informa-
tion retrieval techniques and hashing algorithms. We con-
ducted
several
experiments
to
evaluate
the
different
characteristics that may impact the accuracy of the authentica-
tion process. Results showed that hashing veriﬁcation can be a
good candidate for the automatic authentication process with
high conﬁdence. Some exceptional cases such as the different
Quranic readings are yet to be investigated and evaluated.
Combining hashing methods with typical text plagiarism meth-
ods can be also another alternative approach for the automatic
authentication process. We believe however, that such process
is very important as well as applicable. A typical Quran indexer
can include one table of verses in rows. Content of the verse, its
number, chapter and character size can be the major attributes
to include in the table or the Quran indexer.
A customized Quranic crawler is developed to search for
Quranic verses through the Internet and index pages and infor-
mation about websites that include those verses. We developed
a case study to analyze Google top 10 search results for Quranic
verses where we retrieved results for the verses one by one for
the whole Quran. This was part of an initial assessment to eval-
uate the credibility of websites that include Quranic verses and
that are most popular according to Google ranking algorithms.
Results showed that while some of the most frequently vis-
ited websites for verses search are authentic and credible, how-
ever, in many other cases, some verses are indexed by less
credible websites according to some subjective metrics that
we deﬁned or according to the fact that some of those pages
are related to personal or social networks that are managed
by individuals without any ofﬁcial entity or establishment.
While we only conducted the current experiments on Quran
verses, we believe that same process and tasks can be applied
to evaluate Hadeeths as well. The case of Quranic verses can
be considered easier as Quranic verses are literally identical
even in the different Quran readings (with some few and minor
exceptions).
However,
for
the
case
of
Hadeeths,
some
Hadeeths are mentioned in different wordings where this needs
to be considered in the authentication evaluation process.
As a consequence of this study another research work will
be conducted in future to rank the websites that cite or docu-
ment the Quran verses based on their authenticity and provide
the readers with the top most websites that document the
authenticated Quran verses.
