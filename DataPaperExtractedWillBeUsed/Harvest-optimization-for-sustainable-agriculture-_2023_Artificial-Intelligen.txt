To ensure sustainability in agriculture, many optimization problems need to be solved. An important one of them
is harvest scheduling problem. In this study, the harvest scheduling problem for the tea is discussed. The tea
harvest problem includes the creating a harvest schedule by considering the farmers' quotas under the purchase
location and factory capacity. Tea harvesting is carried out in cooperation with the farmer - factory. Factory man-
agement is interested in using its resources. So, the factory capacity, purchase location capacities and number of
expeditions should be considered during the harvesting process. When the farmer's side is examined, it is seen
that the real professions of farmers are different. On harvest days, farmers often cannot attend to their primary
professions. Considering the harvest day preferences of farmers in creating the harvest schedule are of great
importance for sustainability in agriculture. Two different mathematical models are proposed to solve this
problem. The ﬁrst model minimizes the number of weekly expeditions of factory vehicles within the factor
and purchase location capacity restrictions. The second model minimizes the number of expeditions and aims
to comply with the preferences of the farmers as much as possible. A sample application was performed in a
region with 12 purchase locations, 988 farmers, and 3392 decares of tea ﬁelds. The results show that the compli-
ance rate of farmers to harvesting preferences could be increased from 52% to 97%, and this situation did not
affect the number of expeditions of the factory. This result shows that considering the farmers' preferences on
the harvest day will have no negative impact on the factory. On the contrary, it was concluded that this situation
increases sustainability and encouragement in agriculture. Furthermore, the results show that models are
effective for solving the problem.

1. Introduction
Organizing activities in the agricultural sector are the activities
carried out to develop the decision-making mechanism of the producers
directed towards the same purpose. The sustainable conduct of these
organizational activities increases social and economic efﬁciency (Karlı
et al., 2018). Andrei et al. (2020) argued that agricultural export
competitiveness can only be achieved with increasing productivity.
They mentioned that one of the elements that increase this productivity
is policies aiming to expand relations in the agricultural sector. For these
reasons, social optimization studies to be applied in agriculture are
valuable.
Many plant species can be considered in the social optimization
studies to be applied in the agricultural sector. These plant species
vary according to region. Considering the Black Sea Region in Turkey,
it is seen that social optimization studies can be carried out for
agricultural products such as tea, hazelnuts, corn, and kiwi. When the
tea production is examined, it is noteworthy that Turkey ranks seventh
in the world regarding the width of tea agricultural areas and ﬁfth in dry
tea production. Turkey is located in ﬁrst place according to the world's
statistics of tea consumption per capita (Çaykur, 2019). For these
reasons, the importance of tea in the Turkish agricultural sector is
quite signiﬁcant. Harvest scheduling, vehicle routing, and personnel
scheduling problems in tea farming can be discussed. Optimization
work can be performed for many objectives, such as complying with
the farmers' preferences, minimizing the number of expeditions to pur-
chase locations, collecting the tea harvested with the shortest route, and
scheduling drivers.
The production journey of tea, which is harvested three times a year,
starts with the tea collection process of the farmer. Farmers usually
enter the tea ﬁeld at sunrise and harvest the tea until the afternoon.
The tea is transported to the so-called purchase location for the sale
process of the farmer-factory. Tea is weighed, and the sales process is
completed in the purchase locations. The purchase location and factory
capacity constraints are important in the harvesting process. The

intensities in the purchase locations may cause the tea to remain in the
sun instead of in shaded areas. Tea can be affected by the sun. If the tea is
sunburnt, it is not accepted by the factory. This causes the tea to be
waste. Considering the purchase location capacity is essential to elimi-
nate such grievances. The aim of the minimization of truck expeditions
during harvest scheduling is signiﬁcant to use the resources of the facto-
ries efﬁciently. In addition, it is important for social development and in-
centive to agriculture to consider the harvest day preferences in the
creation of the harvest schedule. Considering these parameters in the
harvest process increases national efﬁciency in tea farming.
In this study, the tea harvest scheduling problem is discussed. Math-
ematical models have been proposed for farmers and factories. These
models consider the weekly harvest day preference constraints, location
constraints, the purchase location capacity, and the factory capacity
constraints. These problem-speciﬁc models offer an innovative ap-
proach to the tea harvesting process and contribute to the literature
on harvest optimization. Most of the tea production in Turkey takes
place in Rize (Çaykur, 2019). Exemplary applications have been carried
out in a region with 988 farmers, 3392 decares of tea ﬁelds, and 12 pur-
chase locations in Rize. With these applications, the performances of the
recommended models were evaluated. This study is a new starting
point in the literature, as it is the ﬁrst work that deals with tea harvest-
ing with the unique constraints mentioned.
The plan of the study is as follows: In the second section, the harvest
scheduling problem is mentioned. In the third section, the studies in the
literature are examined. In the fourth section, a sample application was
performed. The result of the study is in the ﬁfth section.
2. Harvest scheduling problem
In the production and service sectors, schedule problems are fre-
quently encountered. The solution to these problems includes allocating
certain resources to certain tasks. During the allocation, many problem-
speciﬁc criteria can be found (Ceylan et al., 2019). Some issues exam-
ined in the scheduling studies are as follows: personnel scheduling
(Eren and Ünal, 2016; Varlı and Tamer, 2017), job scheduling (Fanjul-
Peyro et al., 2019; Lei et al., 2021; Lei and Liu, 2020), syllabus scheduling
(Çolak and Yiğit, 2021; Eren et al., 2018; Yurtsal and Kaynar, 2022),
maintenance scheduling(Cullum et al., 2018; Dündar and Sarıçiçek,
2021; Özcan et al., 2020). Some of the methods used are as follows:
Goal programming (Ceylan et al., 2019; Eren and Ünal, 2016), artiﬁcial
bee colony (Lei et al., 2021; Lei and Liu, 2020), genetic algorithm
(Yurtsal and Kaynar, 2022), particle swarm optimization(Yurtsal and
Kaynar, 2022).
Harvest optimization problems are the problems that are interested
in ﬁnding the answers to the following questions: i. Which plant should
be planted? ii. When should the harvest be done? iii. Which machines
should be used? iv. Which system or which route should be taken? v.
In which ﬁeld should the product be planted? vi. What should be the
size of the labor force to carry out the harvest? The location of harvest
scheduling problems in the harvest optimization literature is shown in
Fig. 1.
Harvest scheduling applications contain objectives such as efﬁcient
use of resources and maximizing the amount of harvest. With these ap-
plications, factory resources can be used more efﬁciently. In addition,
considering the preferences of farmers can encourage communities to
agriculture. In today's world, where agriculture is increasing day by day
(Kirmikil and Ertaş, 2020), these studies that can increase the efﬁciency
of both farmers and factories are important. Some harvesting processes
are implemented in cooperation with farmers and factories. In these pro-
cesses, both sides have beneﬁt value. The beneﬁt values are optimized by
using resources efﬁciently within the problem's constraints. The optimi-
zation can only take into account farmers or factories. In addition, opti-
mization studies that are interested in both can be carried out. These
studies are handled to increase sustainability in agriculture.
3. Literature review
Harvest optimization in the literature is referred to by various
names: Planting decision optimization (Rollan et al., 2018; Sajid and
Hu, 2022), harvest scheduling (Thuankaewsing et al., 2011), scheduling
of the machines to be used in harvesting (Edwards et al., 2015; He et al.,
2018a, 2018b), labor optimization in agriculture (Busato and Berruto,
2016). Studies have different qualities regarding plant species, the ob-
jective of optimization, and the methods used. The examination of the
studies according to these qualiﬁcations is shown in Table 1.
When the subjects of the literature studies given in Table 1 are exam-
ined, harvest optimization was performed for many objective, such as
planting time optimization (Sajid and Hu, 2022), plant species selection
optimization (Poltroniere et al., 2021), agricultural machine scheduling
and routing (He et al., 2018a). Sarımehmet et al. has done one of the
most recent studies on tea harvest optimization (Sarımehmet et al.,
2023). The GP model is developed in the study and a real case study re-
alized in Turkey. There was no study that optimizes the gains of farmers
and factories for sustainable agriculture by taking the preferences of the
farmers. Our study contributes to the literature in this respect.
It is seen that the mathematical programming method is frequently
used in harvest optimization studies (Grunow et al., 2007; He et al.,
2018b; Poltroniere et al., 2021; Rollan et al., 2018), Artiﬁcial neural net-
works (Sajid and Hu, 2022), the tabu search method (He et al., 2018a)
and statistical methods (Badi et al., 2004) are also used. In this study,
mathematical programming, which is the most preferred method in
the literature, is used.
Fig. 2 depicts the distribution of the studies according to the plant
species discussed. The most discussed plants in the literature appear
to be sugar cane (Grunow et al., 2007; Poltroniere et al., 2021;
Thuankaewsing et al., 2011) and rice (Busato and Berruto, 2016; He
et al., 2018b) respectively. Afforestation (Rollan et al., 2018), wheat
(He et al., 2018a), and thyme (Badi et al., 2004) are also available for
harvest optimization. According to the literature research, tea harvest-
ing scheduling has not been handled before. In this respect, our study
ﬁlls the gap in the harvest optimization literature. Harvest optimization
is discussed in the literature for many plant species for different

objective. The contributions of harvest optimization in this study to the
literature are as follows:
• A Mathematical model has been developed that optimize the beneﬁt
values of the factories (the number of expeditions of the factory
vehicles) in the tea harvest scheduling problem.
• A Mathematical model has been developed that optimize the beneﬁt
values of the farmers (harvesting day preferences) in the tea harvest
scheduling problem.
• In mathematical models developed, there are problem-speciﬁc
constraints like the number of weekly harvesting days and purchase
location capacities preferred by farmers.
• The study contributes to the literature on harvest optimization as it
provides an innovative and sustainable approach by looking at the
tea harvesting process in terms of both a farmer and the factory.
• The problem has been tested by a case analysis using real-life data.
4. Application
Real case study and the method used are mentioned in this section.
4.1. Goal programming
Goal Programming (GP) emerged in 1955 with a study by Charnes
et al. (Charnes et al., 1955) GP is one of the techniques used in the
ﬁeld of multi-objective decision making and scheduling (Dağdeviren
and Eren, 2001). The GP helps to turn all the objectives of the problem
into a constraint and to transfer them to the mathematical model. Linear
programming helps to decide to optimize only one objective. GP mini-
mizes deviations from multiple goals and helps users to manage contra-
dictory objectives more accurately (Leung et al., 2003). Also, GP models
are used for harvest optimization (Rollan et al., 2018). The basic repre-
sentation of the GP method is as follows:

Eq. (1) refers to the minimization of deviation variables, which is the
objective of the GP method. The constraint that constitutes the devia-
tion variables is shown in Eq. (2). Deviation variables in the GP method
are variables that express deviations from speciﬁc targets(s). The aim is
to minimize these variables in the subject function. This is the most sig-
niﬁcant difference from GP's linear programming. With deviation vari-
ables, a GP model has a feasible solution. For example, a deviation

variable may mean that a personnel is not appointed to the day he
wants. With a GP model, personnel preferences can be followed as
much as possible. Eq. (3) refers to the constraint that makes the
deviation variables only in one direction. Eq. (4) is a constant of the
negative of decision variables and deviation variables. This basic GP
model minimizes positive and negative deviations from a goal. With
the GP method, only negative or only positive deviations can be mini-
mized, as well as deviations from multiple goals can be minimized.
The importance of deviations with the coefﬁcients to be given to the de-
viation variables can be indicated. Thus, the priority GP model can be
installed.
4.2. Tea harvest scheduling
In the study, a harvest optimization was performed on tea harvest
scheduling. The ﬂow chart of the application is shown in Fig. 3.
4.3. Problem description
Efﬁcient use of resources is one of the most critical elements affect-
ing the earnings of the factories. The minimum number of truck expedi-
tions required (MNOTER) for each day according to the amount of tea to
be harvested by farmers varies. Considering the truck capacities during
harvest scheduling, it is essential to reduce the number of expeditions
and use the factories' resources efﬁciently. For this reason, a tea harvest
scheduling was made in our study and aimed to minimize the total
weekly MNOTER of the factory.
Tea harvest is performed on average three times a year. Procedures
to be carried out except harvest: Fertilization, pruning, and cleaning of
herbs. The tea does not need irrigation because it grows in wetlands.
Therefore, the tea does not require constant attention and follow-up.
Because of they plan their daily lives accordingly, it is important to pre-
fer harvest days for the farmers. Farmers who can harvest on the day
they prefer will be enthusiastic about tea harvest. This will allow the
use of land that is not planted and harvested for tea harvesting. For
these reasons, a schedule created by considering the farmer's
preferences will directly contribute to sustainability in agriculture. For
this reason, a tea harvesting scheduling that considered the farmers'
preferences was performed.
Each farmer belongs to a purchase location according to where he
resides. Exposure of teas to sunlight burns teas, and some or all of
them lead to the rejection of the factory. Because tea became useless
for factories. The rejection of these teas, which are fertilized, cleaned
from wild herbs, harvested when the time comes, and transported to
the purchase locations causes wastage. For this reason, in this study,
the capacity of purchase location is considered in the tea harvest
scheduling.
4.4. Problem data
The case study was implemented in a region with 988 farmers and
3392 decares of tea ﬁelds in Rize. There are 12 purchase locations in
this region, and all purchase locations are linked to the same factory.
The data were taken from this factory. Each farmer harvests the same
amount of tea on their harvest days. The capacity of the factory for
the area discussed is 288.000 kg per day. The capacity of the vehicles
between the purchase location and the factory is 20.000 kg. The
capacity of the purchase location is the same every day and is as given
in Table 2.
Decare information on the lands of farmers was obtained. Although
the quota varies from period to period, the weekly quota was deter-
mined by the expert opinion that it was 500 kg per decare. The weekly
quota is essential in terms of fair sales of farmers. Tea can be sold six
days a week. In the case study, the number of harvesting days of farmers
was taken into consideration. However, these values were not taken
from farmers and were determined according to expert opinion and
farmer quotas. During the creation of preferences, a variable called nor-
malized value was calculated ﬁrst. This normalized value consists of the
division of the weekly quota of each farmer into the maximum quota.
According to this normalized value, the intervals to be used to
determine the number of harvesting days was created with the support
of expert opinion. Table 3 shows these intervals.

The distribution of farmers according to the number of harvesting
days is as in Table 4.
Day preferences of farmers were randomly made according to the
number of weekly harvest days. In order to measure the determination
of the model, many preference matrices were created in Section 4.6.3
and the effectivity of the model was tested.
4.5. Mathematical models
Two different mathematical models have been developed to pro-
duce solutions for farmers and factories for the tea harvest scheduling
problem. The features of the models are shown in Table 5. The notations
used in mathematical models are given in Table 6.
4.5.1. The model aimed to minimize the weekly MNOTER
This model minimizes the MNOTER complying with farmers' total
number of harvesting days, purchasing place, and factory capacity con-
straints. Minimizing the number of expeditions is essential in terms of
the efﬁcient use of factory vehicles. In this model the day preferences
of farmers are not taken into consideration.

Eq. (5) is the objective function that minimizes the total number of
expeditions weekly. Eq. (6) ensures that farmers are assigned as much
as they should be assigned according to the number of days they want
to harvest. For example, for a farmer who wants to harvest 3 days a
week, the ∑

weekly harvesting days of the farmer by making the ∑

ities. Eq. (8) is the capacity constraint of the factory. It contains the ca-
pacity of the factory for the region discussed daily. Eq. (9) refers to the
constraint of the minimum number of daily expeditions to be done de-
pending on vehicle capacities (β). Eq. (10) refers to the domains of de-
cision variables.
4.5.2. The model that considers the preference of the farmers and the weekly
MNOTER
This model is a multi-objective optimization model. The number of
weekly expeditions is minimized, and it is aimed to comply with the
farmers' preferences as much as possible. The subject function of the
ﬁrst model was brought to Eq. (11) instead of 5. Eq. (12) and Eq. (13)
were included in the model. In this way, the multi-objective optimiza-
tion model has been created.

According to the expert opinions received, k1 is determined as 2 and
k2 as 5. So, the minimization of the number of expeditions is 2.5 times
more important than the deviation
minimization
of
farmers'
preferences. In other words, increasing the total number of weekly
expeditions by two is equivalent to the farmers deviating from the
preference of 5 days.
When determining these values by the experts, the extent to
which both parameters beneﬁt the tea harvest scheduling problem
has been taken into account. Eq. (11) is the objective function,
which minimizes the number of weekly expeditions and the devia-
tion of farmers from their preferences. Eq. (12) constitutes the devia-
tion variable from farmers' day preferences. If the farmer prefers for a
day but is not assigned, the dcg variable takes on a value of 1 and
worsens the object function. Eq. (13) refers to the domains of
decision variables.

Studio 12.8.0 (COS) and Python 3.7.7 using COS's application program-
ming interface (API).
4.6.1. The solution of the model aimed to minimize the weekly MNOTER
The solution with COS took 1.88 s. It was seen that the object func-
tion value of the model was 87, which is the total number of expeditions
weekly. According to the result, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, 15
vehicles; other days 14 vehicles were needed. Although this model did
not aim to adapt to the farmers' harvest day preference, when the solu-
tion result was examined, it was observed that the farmers' preference
matrix was complied with by 52.13%. The assignment of 116 farmers
to the day preferences of the ﬁrst purchase location is shown in
Table 7. The green cells in the table mean that the farmer preferred
that day and was assigned. Red cells mean that the farmer was not
assigned even if he preferred. Empty cells mean that the farmer does
not prefer that day.
There 267 preferences of the farmers who will sell at the ﬁrst pur-
chase location. The created schedule complies with the 129-day prefer-
ence. According to this result, the rate of compliance to the day
preferences of the farmers is 48.31%. The rate of compliance of all pur-
chase locations to day preferences is shown in Table 8.
When Table 8 is examined, it is seen that the purchase location with
the lowest compliance rate is the 11th purchase location with 41.73%,
and the purchase location with the highest compliance rate is the
sixth purchase location with 84.06%. Another value that needs to be an-
alyzed is the capacity utilization ratio (CUR) of the purchase location.
The daily capacity of the ﬁrst reception site is 32,827 kg. Table 9
shows the quantities of tea sold at the ﬁrst purchase location and the
CUR values.
When Table 9 is examined, it is seen that the daily purchase location
capacity is complied with every day at the ﬁrst purchase location.
Analysis of the CUR values of all purchase locations are shown in
Table 10.
Table 10 shows that capacity constraints were observed at all pur-
chase locations on harvest days. This means that the harvested teas
will not be exposed to the risk of being left outside and burned.
4.6.2. The solution of the model that considers the preference of the farmers
and the weekly MNOTER
This model is a multi-objective optimization model. It is aimed to
minimize deviations from farmers' harvest day preferences and the
number of weekly expeditions. The solution with COS took 7.91 s. The
object function value of the model was found to be 541. According to
the schedule, the total weekly MNOTER value is 87. It was seen that
53 of the farmers' preferences is not assigned. The value of 541 is formed
by multiplying 87 by a coefﬁcient of 5, 53 by a coefﬁcient of 2, and then
summing up. According to the result, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Satur-
day, 15 vehicles, other days 14 vehicles were needed. Different results
can be obtained by changing the coefﬁcients in the mathematical
model. According to the schedule, 2201 out of 2254 days preference
were complied with. Accordingly, the adaptation rate to farmers' prefer-
ences was calculated as 97.65%. The assignment of 116 farmers to the
day preferences of the ﬁrst purchase location for examination is
shown in Table 11. The green cells in the table mean that the farmer pre-
ferred that day and was assigned. Red cells mean that the farmer prefers
but is not assigned. Empty cells mean that the farmer does not prefer
that day.
There are 267 preferences of the farmers who will sell at the ﬁrst
purchase location. The created schedule complies with the 263 days
preference. According to this result, the rate of compliance to the day
preferences of the farmers is 98,5%. The rate of compliance of all pur-
chase locations to day preferences is shown in Table 12.
When Table 12 is examined, it is seen that the purchase location
with the lowest compliance rate is the 12th purchase location with
95.3%, and the purchase location with the highest compliance rate is
the sixth purchase location with 100%. Another value that needs to be
analyzed is CUR. The daily capacity of the ﬁrst reception site is
32,827 kg. Table 13 shows the quantities of tea to be sold at the ﬁrst pur-
chase location and the CUR values.
When Table 13 is examined, it is seen that the daily purchase loca-
tion capacity is complied with every day at the ﬁrst purchase location.
Analysis of the CUR values of all purchase locations are shown in
Table 14.
Table 14 shows that capacity constraints were observed at all pur-
chase locations on harvest days. This means that the harvested teas
will not be exposed to the risk of being left outside and burned.
4.6.3. Sensitivity analysis and managerial insights
In this section, sensitivity analysis was performed to measure the ef-
fectiveness of the developed mathematical models in different prefer-
ence matrices. In the model aiming to minimize the MNOTER, the
effect of the number of weekly harvest days of farmers on the model's
success was examined. In the model, which takes into account the pre-
ferred days of the farmers and the weekly MNOTER, the effect of the
farmers' day preferences on the model's success was examined while
the weekly harvest day numbers were ﬁxed.
In the model aimed at minimizing the weekly MNOTER, some of the
harvest day numbers of farmers were modiﬁed to examine the effect of

the number of weekly harvest days on the model's success. The farmers
to be modiﬁed were randomly selected. The weekly harvest day num-
bers of the selected farmers were again randomly changed by one day
in the upward or downward direction. There has been no change in
the upward direction for those whose number of harvest days is six
and downward for those who have one. The reason for changing only
one day is to maintain the reasonableness of the number of harvest
days established by considering the farmer's weekly quota. For example,
it would not be reasonable for a farmer who harvests a large amount of
tea six days a week to change the number of harvest days per week to
one. In this way, 100 preference matrices were produced with Python.
Solutions have been implemented through Python and COS. When the
results were examined, it was seen that the weekly MNOTER was 87
in all of the solutions, and changing the number of harvest days did

fectiveness in different matrices.
In the model, which considers the preferred days of farmers and the
weekly MNOTER, the farmers' harvest day preferences were randomly
changed without changing the number of harvest days. In this way,
100 preference matrices are produced with Python. Solutions have
been implemented through Python and COS. When the results were ex-
amined, it was seen that the weekly MNOTER was 87 in all solutions.

The fact that the value is 87 again shows that the change in farmers' har-
vest day preferences does not affect the weekly MNOTER. The average
rate of adaptation to farmers' preferences was calculated as 97.12%.
Fig. 4 shows the compliance rate of 100 solutions to farmer preferences.
When Fig. 4 is examined, it is seen that the preference compliance
rate is the worst 95.96% and the best 98.05%. Therefore, it was concluded
that farmer preferences could not be fully complied with, and in the
worst case, farmer preferences could be complied with 95% of the
time. Therefore, the absence of a value lower than 95% in the sensitivity
analysis proves the model's effectiveness.
The two mathematical models developed were examined according
to the parameters of adaptation to the farmers' day preferences and the
weekly MNOTER of the factory. This review is shown in Table 15. The *
symbols in the table indicate that the model is intended to optimize the
value in question.
When the models are examined in terms of adaptation to farmer
preferences, it is seen that the model aiming at minimization of the
weekly MNOTER has lower success. This is because the model does
not consider farmer preferences. When the MNOTER is examined, it is
seen that the consideration of farmer preferences does not affect this
value. Although the weekly MNOTER is the same, the second model of-
fers a dominant solution compared to the ﬁrst model because the sec-
ond model is better at adapting to preferences. This proves that while
considering farmers' day preferences, the weekly MNOTER of the facto-
ries can also be minimized. Subjecting the models to sensitivity analysis
and deciding their consistency shows they will succeed in different pref-
erence matrices.
According to the results obtained, the following predictions are
made to the managers:
• By considering the weekly MNOTER during tea harvest scheduling,
the competitiveness of tea producers in sales prices will increase as
factory resources will be used more efﬁciently.
• Considering the capacities of the purchase location is important for
the sake of not losing the harvest, efﬁcient use of the receiving places,
and the sustainability of the farmer-factory relationship. In addition,
as a result of analysing the occupancy rates of the reception place, it
may be considered to make the purchase locations with low CUR
value inactive on certain days. In this way, the shipping program can
become more efﬁcient.
• The case study proven that considering the farmers' harvest day pref-
erences during harvest scheduling will not create any cost to the fac-
tory. On the contrary, considering farmers' preferences is important to
increase sustainability in agriculture.
• Compliance with farmers' harvest day preferences and accordingly
purchasing the farmers' harvest from the purchase locations will in-
crease the preferability of tea-producing companies. As a result, com-
panies will increase their competitiveness and get one step ahead in
the market.
5. Conclusion
In the study, a harvest optimization for sustainable agriculture was
carried out. Two mathematical models have been developed for tea har-
vest scheduling. One of these models only optimizes factory resources,
while another aims to comply with factory resources and farmer prefer-
ences as much as possible. A case study was conducted in a region with
3392 decares tea ﬁelds, 12 tea receiving places and a factory. The sched-
ule created with the models is compared in terms of the number of ex-
peditions made by the factory vehicles and the adaptation to the day
preferences of the farmers. According to the mathematical model,
which only considers the number of expeditions of factory vehicles, it

is seen that 87 expeditions per week are required and the rate of adap-
tation to farmer preferences is 52.13%. In the model, which considers
the day preferences of farmers and factory vehicles, it was seen that
while the number of expeditions remained the same, the rate of adapta-
tion to farmers' day preferences increased from 52.13% to 97.65%. This
result shows that considering the farmers' day preferences does not
negatively impact the factory and can increase sustainability and incen-
tives in agriculture. Companies can increase their preference by consid-
ering the farmers' harvest day preferences and get one step ahead in the
market.
In future studies, vehicle routing and personnel scheduling prob-
lems may also be included in the tea harvest scheduling problem. It
can be decided which days the farmers will harvest, which route
the factory's vehicles will follow, and which purchase locations will
stop. Staff scheduling studies can be carried out for drivers and pur-
chase location ofﬁcers. The effect of making farmers' buying places
ﬂexible on the rate of adaptation to their day preferences can be ex-
amined. Larger problems can be addressed, and scheduling can be
carried out for all reception locations connected to the factory. As
the complexity of models increases, solutions can be realized with
heuristic methods.
