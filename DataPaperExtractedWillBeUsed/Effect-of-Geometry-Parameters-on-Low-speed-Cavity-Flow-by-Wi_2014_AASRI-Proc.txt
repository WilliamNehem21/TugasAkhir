Abstract 
In this paper, experiment platform for cavity flow is built in low-turbulence wind tunnel. based on the measurement of 
wall static pressure and sound pressure with microphones, the basic flow oscillation characteristics of different type cavity 
in low speed are studied. The effect of geometry parameters of length to depth ratio and width to depth ratio on cavity 
flow pattern and noise characteristics is obtained. The results show that in the incompressible flow state, the basic flow 
pattern of cavities is not affected by flow velocity; length-to-depth ratio of 1 to 12 covers the flow pattern from open to 
close, and with the length-to-depth ratio increase, the cavity radiation SPL increases; with aspect ratio increase, the sound 
pressure energy of cavity also increase.

1. Introduction 
Cavity flow is a problem often encountered in practical engineering, and is currently a hot aerodynamics 
research field internationally. there are a variety of complex unsteady cavity flow such as aircraft landing gear, 
weapons bay, car sunroof and so on. When the flow passes over the cavity, flow oscillation will be produced 
and radiate noise. The research of cavity flow typically involving complex flow-sound-vortex interference, 
unsteady character and shear layer instability problems, which has great research significance. 
For the study of cavity flow, since the 1950s, more tests have been carried out, and since the 1980s, 
numerical simulation was widely used in cavity flow study on mechanism and flow control design. Certain 
Studies [1-8] showed that the geometric parameters such as the length to depth ratio L/D, the aspect ratio W/D, 
flow parameters such as Mach number affect the cavity flow pattern and the acoustic characteristics. 
In this paper, experiment platform for cavity flow studies was built in low-turbulence wind tunnel, with the 
use of wall pressure sensors and microphones, the effects cavity geometry on low-speed cavity flow 
oscillation characteristics were studied experimentally and provide reference for cavity noise suppression 
research. 
2. Experimental Method 
2.1. Experimental Model 
The Cavity model is structured by wood and the model blockage in wind tunnel is about 8%.  
The maximum depth of the cavity 116mm, maximum length 700mm, and the maximum width 120mm.. 
Figure 1 shows the parameter definition of cavity geometry. The contact surface of cavity with wind tunnel is 
filled with soft foam padding to avoid local airflow crossing up and down and reduce the effects of wind 
tunnel vibration on the flow structure of cavity.  
Length to depth ratio and width to depth ratio of Cavity vary by adding blocks in cavity or adjusting the 
cavity depth while the maximum width of the cavity remains unchanged. The effect of geometry changes on 
the aeroacoustic characteristics of cavity flow were discussed, and specified programs are shown in Table 1.

2.2. Wind tunnel 
The wind tunnel test is carried out in low turbulence wind tunnel (LTWT) of Northwestern Polytechnical 
University. The test section of LTWT has two different layouts: three dimensional-only and three dimensional 
connected with two dimensional. In this paper, the cavity is tested in two dimensional test section which has 
the cross-sectional dimension of 1.0m × 0.4m. The wind speed operation range in wind tunnel is 5m/s~75m/s. 
2.3. Experimental Equipment  
The static pressure data are acquired using DSY 104 electron scanning micro-pressure measurement 
system, which has 192 channels with the channel scan rate of 50,000/ sec and the system accuracy is 
±0.1%FS. Dynamic pressure measurement and spectrum acquisition are obtained by Belgian LMS dynamic 
measurement system. The system has LMS SCM01 Mobile 8-channel data acquisition front, PCB acoustic 
sensors, model 130P10/D10, and frequency range is 10-15KHz.

2.4.  Experimental conditions  
Experimental wind speed range is V=10~50m/s, � V=10m/s, the angle of attack α=0°. The Reynolds 
number based on the cavity depth D is between 0.397×105 ~ 3.97×105.  
3. Effect of length to depth ratio  
Figure 3 and Figure 4 give out the averaged pressure distribution on cavity bottoms and 1/3 octave curve 
for sound pressure level measured at the center point of cavity bottoms under the same cavity inlet and wind 
speed of 30m/s. 
Figure 3 shows that when the flow stream conditions is consistent, with length to depth ratio L/D varies 
from 1 to 12 , the pressure on cavity bottoms goes gently through the development from flat to step, covering 
four basic flow pattern from open to close, and the corresponding length to depth ratio L/D is2, 4, 8 and 12 
respectively. For cavity of L/D=2, the pressure distribution is changed gently with the low pressure in middle, 
for L/D=4, the spoon-shaped distribution is formed, i.e., the front part pressure is high and flattening, and the 
rear part pressure decreases. As the ratio of length to depth continues to increase, the front pressure decreases, 
the rear end of the bottom pressure rise, till to L/D=12, the middle pressure forms a platform.

Fig.3. pressure distribution on cavity bottom for L/D                        Fig.4. Noise spectrum for cavities measured at bottom center 
Figure 4 shows that the noise in the cavity exhibits broadband characteristics, mainly due to low frequency 
radiation caused by the flow oscillations. When the flow velocity is 30m/s, with decreasing of length to depth 
ratio, sound pressure level radiated from cavity is reduced. For L/D=2, the maximum sound pressure level is 
90dB, which is lower than L/D=12 by 15dB. Open cavity flow can generate oscillations which appear that 
certain frequencies amplified and sound pressure level forms peaks at some frequency. 
4. Wind speed effect  
Figure 5 shows the static pressure distribution comparison within wind speed range of 10m/s~50m/s for 
cavity L/D=4,12. The results denoted that in the low speed (M <0.2) incompressible flow, the wind speed has 
less affect the averaged pressure distribution in a small magnitude, i.e., with the flow velocity increased, the 
cavity internal flow increase, but does not change the basic flow type of cavity. 
Figure 6 gives out the noise characteristics on bottom center at different wind speeds for L/D=4, 12. As 
seen from the figure that for the same geometry, with the  flow velocity increases, the radiated noise pressure 
48  
 Guangjun Yang et al. /  AASRI Procedia  9 ( 2014 )  44 – 50 
increases. For L/D=12, the maximum SPL reach to 109dB at 50m/s, 26dB more than that at 10m/s. This 
indicates that with the flow velocity increasing, the cavity pressure and density largely oscillate, which greatly 
increase the amplitude of noise, but the affect little on the oscillation frequency.

5. Effect of width to depth ratio

Fig.8. Effect of aspect ratio W/D on noise spectrum measured at bottom centre 
Figure 7 shows that with the aspect ratio W/D increases, the spanwise flow enhanced which can effectively 
alleviate adverse pressure gradient on bottoms, so that the pressure distribution tends to be flat. For L/D=4, 
there are changes trends to the open flow type. Noise spectrum in Figure 8 shows that the changes of width to 
depth ratio greatly affect the cavity radiated noise, namely, with the aspect ratio increasing, the sound pressure 
peak is eliminated, but the maximum sound pressure level increases by at least 10dB. 
6. Conclusions  
By low-speed and low-turbulence wind tunnel experiments, aerodynamic and acoustic property of cavities 
with various geometries was achieved. The basic conclusions are as followings:  
(1) with the same velocity, as length to depth ratio increases, radiated noise by the cavity flow increase, 
and for flow in cavities of L/D≤4, the acoustic spectrum appear as sound pressure peak at some frequencies.  
(2) at low speed incompressible flow state, when the cavity geometry is unchanged, with the velocity 
increases, little effect on the basic flow patterns and the noise frequency, but the noise amplitude increases 
greatly.  
(3) when aspect ratio W/D increased, there is a transform tendency for the cavity flow to open pattern, but 
noise radiation greatly increases at the meanwhile.
