Abstract 
In order to realize the intelligent of computer based training system, this paper puts forward a knowledge form retrieval 
method based on information entropy. Through analyze the inner link which existing between the knowledge forms, we 
can build knowledge base, and can find the knowledge forms which cause the failure of training through information 
entropy calculation. Use information entropy and combination entropy calculation formula, we can retrieval and 
construction the knowledge chains which cause training failure, and regroup into learners training knowledge base.

practice and test repeatedly, but it is the new hot technology for CBT research that is how to setting up 
reasonable training knowledge base for different training phase, especially use computer intelligent  
technology to eliminate the knowledge points which the student have mastered and realize the intelligent 
organization for training knowledge base. 
The intelligent organization of knowledge base is based with the people's cognitive research. The professor 
Chen Qing-quan who is academician of Chinese academy of engineering summarize the current age with 
BINC, BINC namely biological technology, information technology, nano technology and cognitive 
technology[1]. Cognitive science is interdisciplinary combination with philosophy, psychology, linguistics, 
anthropology, and neuroscience and computer science [2]. Yu Sheng-quan has pointed out that the third time 
digital learning has already "from transmission and behavioral paradigm to the constructiveness cognitive 
paradigm, and then turned to the situation cognitive paradigm [3]". 
From the perspective of cognitive science, the strengthen training is the best way and important method of 
learning to improve memory ability and ultimately effect. For the intelligent of CBT system, the purpose is 
strengthen training, through evaluating the student's training effect which have finished on the prior stage of 
learning, the system can automatically analyze the student forgotten knowledge (namely knowledge element 
which lead to the training failure), search the related knowledge chain, and constructs the secondary training 
knowledge base, so can make the student have effective strengthen memory training with specific aim and 
achieve economic and efficient training purpose. 
2. The intrinsic cognitive mechanism of knowledge base 
The training knowledge base of CBT system is constructed by much basic knowledge form. From the view 
of cognitive, there are some certain order and hierarchical relationships for knowledge forms between each 
other in the knowledge learning and memory, and the knowledge forms link to mesh structure. The 
knowledge base chains relationship can be divided into order chain and support chain, order chain is the most 
basic relations between knowledge forms which express the progressive of information accepted, support 
chain express the interaction support relationship between each other, as shown in figure 1 below. 
 
Fig. 1. the connectionism network model of information point (knowledge element) 
Based on cognitive thinking and decision-making principle, the first step of training plans intelligent 
organization is knowledge element detection, it is a related illation realization process that the knowledge 
element is examined. For the knowledge element search of CBT system, it is sure that the knowledge element 
279
 Hemin Du /  AASRI Procedia  3 ( 2012 )  277 – 283 
 
which leads to the failure of training existed in the training knowledge base, so the reasoning process of 
knowledge element detection is a kind of typical certainty reasoning. 
In the knowledge base system of CBT, we can regard it as a figure for knowledge network, it is a process 
which search for the knowledge in the figure that the related knowledge element is searched, the process can 
be form a figure search strategy, and we can express the basic figure search strategy as the flow description in 
figure 2 below: 
 
Fig. 2. reasoning process diagram of CBT knowledge element search 
The secondary scheme of CBT system intelligence organization for training results which shown in figure 
2 can be described as follow: the knowledge base which formed by the basic knowledge can be regarded as 
the whole search figure, the knowledge element storage container which retrieved and cause the failure of 
training can be regard as OPEN list, the eventually retrieved knowledge element storage container can be 
regard as CLOSE list. For the current training results, we can score points as hundred when processing 
intelligent illation retrieval. If the score of current training result is 100 points, it shows that the training 
entirely correct, and knowledge element has completely mastered, there does not exist searchable contents, 
namely the OPEN list is empty, search failure, end the search; If the score of current training result is not 100 
points, it shows that there exist some knowledge element in OPEN list, choose the knowledge element which 
caused the training failure, mark it as n, and move it from OPEN list to CLOSE list. We can know from 
connectionism network model that there maybe exist support chain in knowledge element (show that n is a 
expanded node), the expanded node will also be corresponding detection, and moved to CLOSE list; Now, the 
rest of contents (the successor node of n, which be put at the end of the OPEN list) would be rearranged in the 
OPEN list and form a new OPEN list. The system would continue to illation with the above reasoning rule 
until the end of illation, so the search illation for knowledge element which would be all may lead to failure of 
training is over.

3. Knowledge base information entropy 
The figure search strategy which based on cognitive reveals the reasoning principle and process which can 
find the cause training failure knowledge element in knowledge base. We can use it to realize the knowledge 
reasoning through the information entropy algorithm.  
For example, in the aircraft maintenance CBT training system, it constitute a complete knowledge base by 
each part of the basic knowledge, assembly knowledge and fault detection knowledge, when the student detect 
whose learning effects, the reasons that led to the training failure are various, there are not only due to the 
learn reasons, but also because of some unexpected reasons. However, the system be only able to detect the 
knowledge element factor, in other words, it only find which knowledge element cause the training failure, 
because there are the complex relationship between the knowledge elements, therefore, there maybe exist the 
uncertainty of information target. 
In the 1960s, the United States cybernetics scholars L.A.Zadeh put forward and development the fuzzy 
mathematics method; in the 1980s, the polish mathematician Z.P awlak put forward the rough set theory; in 
addition, there is gray system, and so on[4]. Though these methods showed very good performance in 
uncertainty, indeterminacy and imprecision for processing information[5], and have made great achievements 
in intelligent information processing, but in the perspective of CBT system knowledge reasoning, it's difficult 
to connect them with the retrieval of knowledge element, it is mainly because of the complexity of the joined 
knowledge network which make the relationship of relevant knowledge element are unlikely to quantitative 
description. However, Claude Elwood Shannon put forward the information entropy which shows the huge 
potential in this problem. 
Shannon puts forward the concept of information entropy in a mathematical theory of communication in 
1948, which is regarded as the foundation of modern information theory. Entropy theory establishes the 
mathematical model for the communication process [6]. Shannon's entropy theory is limited to the 
mathematical theory of communication system, so it is called narrow sense information theory. However, the 
application of information theory far more than communication theory, it has cross with physics (statistical 
mechanics), mathematics (probability theory), electronic engineering (communication theory) and computer 
science (algorithm complexity) [7]. 
4. The information entropy algorithm for secondary organization of knowledge base  
In the aspect of mathematics (include probability theory and statistics), the basic concepts of the 
information theory which include entropy, relative entropy and mutual information can be defined as a 
probability distribution function, any one of them can depict and expression the behavior characteristic of long 
sequence random variables, them can be used to estimate the probability of rare events, and find the best of 
index error in the hypothesis. Based on this, we can use the concept of information entropy as the foundation 
of implementing knowledge element intelligent search in the CBT system construction. 
4.1. Information Entropy 
A system more orderly, the information entropy is lower; conversely, a system more chaos, the information 
entropy is higher. Therefore, from the perspective of the information theory, the information entropy is a 
measure degree of system orderly. 
The basic concept of information entropy includes self-information, information entropy and combination 
entropy. 
281
 Hemin Du /  AASRI Procedia  3 ( 2012 )  277 – 283 
 
Self-information: used for information measure, when the information source sent out a signal
x0
, the 
provided amount of information is called of x0 self-information, record as I(x0), it is the measurement values 
of uncertainty of signal x0. In the knowledge element searching, the probability of knowledge element x0 
which affect some training failure is recorded as P(x0). For x
, the greater the probability x
, the greater 
the chance of the occurrence, and the smaller the value uncertainty I(x).  
For I(x), there is formula 1: 
1
( )
log
( )
I x
c
p x
 
. (1) 
C is constant, the base number of logarithm is 2, and the unit of self-information is bit.  
Information entropy: it is for the entire source, express the amount of average information for each one of 
these signals. If use random variable represents an information source, the entropy is its measurement of the 
average uncertainty. In the CBT system, set X is random variables between the value and knowledge element, 
the probability distribution function is

Combination entropy: in the CBT system, the knowledge element which influences the training result may 
be transverse, multidimensional, so we import the concept of combination entropy. Set the joint distribution of

4.2. The intelligent organization algorithm of knowledge base information entropy 
We can put forward the concept of knowledge base information entropy that connects knowledge base with 
information entropy to constitute the secondary training scheme organization for CBT system.  
The basic theory of knowledge base information entropy: the all knowledge in the CBT training library 
constitute knowledge base in the form of knowledge element, if there is any errors or failures in training, then 
show that there are knowledge element is active state which related the training content, and whose 
information entropy tends to maximize, in other words, the more information entropy of any knowledge 
element, the larger influence to the training result. 
The mathematics representation of knowledge base information entropy: set have k knowledge element in 
anyone training knowledge base. According to contain a combination mathematics knowledge element whose 
item amount is 
i
k
C  (means different i items have
i
k
C , i
 k). So there have the possible different knowledge 
element (item sets) of 2

k
kinds. Set every different item sets expressed by random variable 
(
1,2,...,2

k

X i
, 
suppose 
iP  express appear probability of random variables Xi (it is the i item sets), there is

Through the above analysis, we can obtain the related definition of knowledge base information entropy:  
Define: set any knowledge base A , there has k kind of different knowledge element, the k kind of 
knowledge element form 2

kind of different item sets. Set the real probability of each item

I A is the information entropy of knowledge base A . 
The information entropy of knowledge base ( )
I A  has the nature properties 0

. The information 
entropy is smaller, express the effects of learning for knowledge base is good, and there are less that the 
 mastered knowledge element, in other words, ( )
I A  more close to 0 shows that the training effect 
more better, ( )
I A  more close to 1 shows that the training effect more worse, there are more active knowledge 
element in knowledge base, and there are larger workload which need to strengthen training, based on this, the 
system can automatically rearrange the knowledge element, excluding the mastered training knowledge, and 
the secondary training knowledge base generated automatically. 
5. Conclusion 
The key of secondary intelligent organization for CBT training is to look for the knowledge base which 
leads to the failure of training. This paper start from the perspective of cognitive science, puts forward the 
concept of knowledge base information entropy, and built the knowledge element search algorithm which can 
realize the intelligence of CBT system; it has important meaning for improving availability and efficiency of 
the CBT system. As the specific application test, we have developed the intelligent computer based aircraft 
maintenance training system which proved the feasibility of this algorithm. Now, in the aspect of the system 
perfection, there are some details problem (such as the division of the knowledge element particle size and 
weight coefficient between knowledge elements) need to be solve in the next work.
