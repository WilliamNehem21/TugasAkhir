Compositional reservoir simulation is an important tool to model ﬂuid ﬂow in oil and gas reservoirs. Important
investment decisions regarding oil recovery methods are based on simulation results, where hundred or even
thousand of different runs are performed. In this work, a new methodology using artiﬁcial intelligence to learn the
thermodynamic equilibrium is proposed. This algorithm is used to replace the classical equilibrium workﬂow in
reservoir simulation. The new method avoids the stability test for single-phase cells in most cases and provides an
accurate two-phase ﬂash initial estimate. The classical and the new workﬂow are compared for a gas-oil mixing
case, showing a simulation time speed-up of approximately 50%. The new method can be used in compositional
reservoir simulations.
1. Introduction
Compositional reservoir simulation is a numerical model used to
solve the ﬂuid transport in porous media coupled with thermodynamic
phase equilibrium (Fussell and Fussell, 1979; Coats, 1980). To describe
the reservoir accurately, numerical grid may be composed of millions of
cells, and along a compositional simulation the phase equilibrium is
solved for each cell every time-step. Thus, most part of computational
effort is spent in ﬂash calculations. There are cases where equilibrium
calculations reach more than 50% of simulation time (Okuno et al., 2009;
Wang et al., 2019a,b).
Incipient compositional simulators used a K-value approach, where
the thermodynamic equilibrium was calculated a priori and stored in
tables or correlations of K-values, where Ki is the ratio between the mole
fraction of component i in gas and in oil phases (Ki ¼ yi/xi) (Kniazeff and
Naville, 1965; Price and Donohue, 1967; Culham et al., 1969; Roebuck
et al., 1969). This approach does not require much memory or processing
capacity. The main problem of such model is that K-values may lead to
phase composition errors, specially near to critical points.
The increase of computers processing capacity allowed a new
compositional simulation technique, based on equations of state (EOS).
In this case, the phase equilibrium is solved rigorously, using cubic EOS
(Fussell and Fussell, 1979; Coats, 1980; Thele et al., 1983; Okuno et al.,
2009; Moortgat and Firoozabadi, 2013; Schmall et al., 2013). This
approach is accurate, and does not cause numerical instability near the
critical point. However, 2Nc þ 1 equations for each grid cell must be
solved every time step, where Nc is the number of components. Then, for
large reservoir grids, computational cost becomes very expensive (Todd
and Longstaff, 1972; Wong et al., 1987; El-Banbi et al., 2000). To over-
come this limitation, lumping techniques may be used to reduce the
number of components in ﬂuid description (Joergensen and Stenby,
1995; Jessen and Moghadam, 2009; Alavian et al., 2014).
For every time-step, appearance and disappearance of a phase must
be evaluated in all cells. The phase disappearance is a simple problem
(Whitson and Michelsen, 1989; Li and Firoozabadi, 2012), but phase
appearance

time-consuming process.
In the phase appearance algorithm, the stability of a single-phase cell
is checked. One technique compares the saturation pressure of the ﬂuid
in the cell with the cell pressure (Fussell and Yanosik, 1978; Fussell and
Fussell, 1979; Coats, 1980). Modern simulators use the tangent plane
stability test to determine if a given single-phase composition is stable
(Baker et al., 1982; Michelsen, 1982a; Sun and Seider, 1995; Firoozabadi
and Pan, 2000; Li and Firoozabadi, 2012). In both cases we must solve a
system of non-linear equations by iterative methods. If the phase is not
stable, a two-phase ﬂash calculation is performed to determine the phase
composition and saturations in each cell (Fussell and Yanosik, 1978;
Boston and Britt, 1978; Hirose et al., 1978; Michelsen, 1982b; Abhvani

and Beaumont, 1987; Li and Johns, 2006).
A technique called Compositional Space Adaptive Tabulation (CSAT)
was proposed to decrease the number of stability tests and two-phase
ﬂash calculations during reservoir simulations. In this approach, ther-
modynamic equilibrium data is stored in tables. During the simulation,
initial estimates for ﬂash calculations are obtained interpolating the
stored data (Voskov and Tchelepi, 2009b,a). This approach provides
accurate initial estimates for ﬂash algorithms, decreasing the number of
iterations. However, the more components are used in ﬂuid description,
the more computational time is spent to interpolate the data, decreasing
the method efﬁciency (Rezaveisi et al., 2014).
In this work we propose a similar technique to provide initial esti-
mates for ﬂash calculations, using artiﬁcial neural networks instead of
tie-line interpolation. A neural network model is based on the human
brain and is applied in recognition and classiﬁcation problems. Mathe-
matically, the neural network is known as a universal function approx-
imator, able to adjust any continuous multivariate function (Ojha et al.,
2017). There are many applications of artiﬁcial intelligence in thermo-
dynamic equilibrium problems. Goda et al. (2003) trained a neural
network to predict black-oil type ﬂuid properties with data from more
than 160 different ﬂuids from Middle East reservoirs.
Neural network was also applied to predict CO2 solubility in ionic
liquids (Baghban et al., 2015). Using 728 experimental data from 14
different ionic liquids, a solubility model was built as a function of the
critical properties of the pure components, pressure and temperature.
The network correlation coefﬁcient was R2 ¼ 0.9336, better than the
ones obtained using PR-EOS (Robinson and Peng, 1978) (R2 ¼ 0.7323)
and the SRK-EOS (Soave, 1972) (R2 ¼ 0.6989). Baghban et al. (2016a,b)
developed several models to predict air dew point and hydrate formation

in different scenarios. The enthalpy of vaporization of pure substances
based on its boiling temperature, speciﬁc gravity and the molecular
weight was also modeled using neural networks (Eghtedaei et al., 2019).
Artiﬁcial intelligence can be trained with a particular numerical
reservoir model generating a proxy that is much faster to evaluate. This
proxy model is used to optimize production alternatives and to evaluate
uncertainty through Monte Carlo simulations, where thousands of runs
are needed to achieve satisfactory results (Mohaghegh et al., 2012; Ala-
keely and Horne, 2021b). Multiphase ﬂow rate in producing wells can be
estimated using deep learning techniques (Tian and Horne, 2017; Li
et al., 2019; Alakeely and Horne, 2021a). These artiﬁcial intelligence
methods are trained using the production history, and are accurate
enough to be used in real-time monitoring tools. A Physics-Informed
Neural Network (PINN) can be used to create a meshless reservoir
model that can provide accurate results in higher dimensional problems
when compared to traditional simulation techniques (Cheung et al.,
2018; Coutinho et al., 2021, 2022; Almajid and Abu-Alsaud, 2022).
Wang et al. (2019a,b) created a neural network model to predict the
bubble point of hydrocarbon mixtures and provide an initial guess for the
two-phase ﬂash algorithm. The total reservoir simulation time was
reduced in 30%, mainly because the stability test algorithm was replaced
by the comparison between the cell pressure and the bubble point pre-
dicted by the neural network.
In this work we present a neural network method to provide accurate
initial estimates for ﬂash calculations instead of the phase stability test.
This procedure may be applied to compositional reservoir simulation
saving computational time. The proposed method tests the phase stability
and classiﬁes it as a liquid or vapor in the single phase case. In Section 2
we discuss the thermodynamic equilibrium routines, and compare the
classical simulation workﬂow with a new one, based on neural network.
Then, in Section 3 the new technique is evaluated, checking the accuracy
of the predicted thermodynamic calculations and comparing the
computational time between the classical approach and the one proposed
in this work. Finally, some conclusions are addressed in Section 4.
2. Two-phase equilibrium
This section presents the mathematical description of the ﬂash equi-
librium problem and describes how artiﬁcial intelligence can be used to
improve these routines.
A closed system at constant pressure, temperature and global
composition is at equilibrium if the total Gibbs free energy (G) is
minimal:

2.1. Phase identiﬁcation workﬂow
In compositional reservoir simulation, the phase stability test
(Michelsen, 1982a; Firoozabadi and Pan, 2000; Li and Firoozabadi,
2012) is performed in single phase cells to evaluate if the Gibbs free

energy is minimal (stable) or if the phase splits in two (unstable). The
difference of the Gibbs free energy between a two phase system and a
reference phase is given by:
ΔG ¼ ðGI þ GIIÞ � G0
(2)
where GI and GII are the Gibbs free energy of phases I and II, and G0 is the
Gibbs free energy of the reference phase with composition Z!. Consid-
ering that the reference phase splits in two, where the new phase has an
inﬁnitesimal mole number (ε) and composition ζ!, Equation (2) can be
rewritten in molar basis as:

it is known that if F � 0 for any possible ζ! composition, then the
reference phase Z! is stable as a single-phase mixture. Instead of evalu-
ating this equation for all possible ζ! compositions, the stability test
searches for critical points, where the Gibbs free energy is a local mini-
mum. A critical point can be found using a direct substitution method

(6)
where pc,i, Tc,i and ωi are the critical pressure, critical temperature and
acentric factor of component i. The K-value relates the vapor (yi) and
liquid (xi) molar fractions:
Ki ¼ yi

(7)
then, if a liquid-like phase is evaluated the initial trial composition is
given by ζi ¼ Zi
Ki, and if a vapor-like phase is tested the initial trial
composition is ζi ¼ KiZi.
If the phase is stable a phase identiﬁcation algorithm to determine if it
is a liquid or gas must be performed. When the system temperature T is
greater than the mixture critical temperature (T > Tc) the phase is labeled
as a vapor, otherwise as a liquid. The critical temperature depends on the
mixture composition and requires great computational effort. In
compositional reservoir simulation, the critical temperature is usually
approximated by the modiﬁed Li mixing rule (Li, 1971):
Tc ¼ r1
PNc
i¼0xiVc;iTc;i
PNc
i¼0xiVc;i
(8)
where Vc,i is the critical volume of component i and r1 is an adjustable
parameter used to tune this algorithm.
The previously described process will be called classical phase equi-
librium algorithm, which is used in EOS based compositional reservoir
simulators (Fig. 1). Note that the ﬂuid is only considered single-phase
after two stability tests, for both liquid and vapor initial estimates, and
then performing a phase identiﬁcation algorithm. Along a full ﬁeld
compositional reservoir simulation, this routine is called for each grid
cell every time step, making this algorithm responsible for about 50% of
processing time, where the stability test is the most consuming part
(Wang et al., 2019a,b).
2.2. Neural network applied to phase identiﬁcation
To decrease the number of calls of the stability test and phase labeling
algorithms we developed a neural network specialized in phase identi-
ﬁcation (Fig. 2). The Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) was the network
layout chosen. In Fig. 2, each circle is a perceptron neuron and each layer
is directly connected with the next (Haykin, 1999). For the phase iden-
tiﬁcation network, all neurons have the same sigmoidal activation
function, given by:
Nð x! ¼
1
1 þ e�ð x!� w!�bÞ
(9)
where x! is the neuron input vector (lines in Fig. 2), w
! is the neuron
weight vector and b the constant bias. Note that the neuron output is
limited by the interval Nð x! 2 ð0; 1Þ. So, training a network is an opti-
mization problem to deﬁne the values of w
! and b of each neuron that
minimize the error between the network response and the output for a
given training data-set.
For the phase identiﬁcation network, deﬁning as input the pressure,
temperature and global composition ðp; T; Z!Þ, this algorithm returns
three real numbers in the interval ð0; 1Þ: liquid (L), vapor (V) or two-
phase (TPH). The phase identiﬁcation (PhID) is performed through a
voting system, in which the neural network response is the greatest value
among the three outputs:
PhID ¼ maxðL; V; TPHÞ
(10)
To check if the network response is valid we estimate the conﬁdence
of PhID by:
Fig. 11. Phase envelope for different gas fractions (αg).
W.Q. Barros, A.P. Pires
Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Geosciences 2 (2021) 202–214
207
CðPhIDÞ ¼ maxðL; V; TPHÞ
ðL þ V þ TPHÞ
(11)
The phase identiﬁed by the neural network is accepted if its conﬁ-
dence is greater than 95%, otherwise the traditional phase identiﬁcation
workﬂow is used (Section 2.1).
The introduction of the conﬁdence concept and labeling it as a liquid
or vapor in the single phase case are some improvements of the technique
presented in this work when compared with other methods reported in
literature (Wang et al., 2019a,b). Its importance raises when miscible
processes are simulated, because the ﬂuid phase may change from liquid
to vapor without crossing the two phase boundary or even crossing the
two-phase envelope. Thus, the use of the proposed method reduces the
number of stability tests calls.
2.3. Two-phase ﬂash algorithm
The phase equilibrium conditions for a two-phase system is given by
(Prausnitz et al., 1998; Sandler, 2006):

where φc is the fugacity coefﬁcient of a component in a mixture, calcu-
lated using any equation of state and the superscripts l and v relate the
liquid and vapor phases. The fugacity condition equation for each
component can be rewritten in a residual form:
logðφiðp; T; y!Þ Þ � logðφiðp; T; x!Þ Þ þ logðKiÞ ¼ Ri; i ¼ 1; …; Nc
(13)
and solved using the Newton-Raphson's method. Usually the K-values
obtained at the end of the phase stability test (Equation (5)) are used as
the initial estimate. After convergence the vapor phase mole fraction (V)
is determined solving the Rachford-Rice equation (Rachford and Rice,
1952):

2.4. Neural network to estimate initial ﬂash calculations
When the phase identiﬁcation neural network is used to determine
the number of phases in the system, the phase stability algorithm is not
run and initial estimates for the two phase ﬂash algorithm are not
available (Equation (13)). To overcome this limitation, artiﬁcial intelli-
gence is used to generate initial estimates to Equation (13).
For this problem, one MLP network is trained for each ﬂash variable
(V, logðK1Þ, …, logðKNcÞ) (Fig. 3). The input is the same of the stability
test and phase identiﬁcation ðp; T; Z!Þ and there is one output neuron in
each network. The output neuron uses the linear activation function:
Nð x! ¼ x!� w
! � b
(16)
while all other neurons of the input and hidden layers use the rectiﬁed
Fig. 12. Vapor mole fraction calculated by an EOS and estimated by the neural network and by Wilson correlation for three different (p, T) conditions and
gas fractions.

linear activation function:
Nð x! ¼ maxð0; x!� w
! � bÞ
(17)
It should be noted that a different neural network for each ﬂash
variable (V, logðK1Þ, …, logðKNcÞ) must be built. This architecture is based
on the specialization concept, where the reduction of the number of
output variables decreases the size of the optimization problem and in-
creases its accuracy (Haykin, 1999).
2.5. Improved two-phase equilibrium model
Fig. 4 shows the proposed phase equilibrium workﬂow that uses
artiﬁcial intelligence to replace part of the classical ﬂash calculations
(Fig. 1). The ﬁrst step uses the phase identiﬁcation network to generate
an estimate of the conﬁdence and identify the ﬂuid phase (Equation
(11)). If CðPhIDÞh95% the result is not considered and the usual stability
test is performed. Otherwise, the ﬂash parameters using the estimate
network for the two-phase region are generated (Fig. 3).
The proposed methodology does not replace completely the ﬂash
calculation in compositional simulators. It avoids stability tests and
provides initial estimates very close to the solution of the ﬂash. As it will
be discussed in the next section, the neural network workﬂow, combined
with the conﬁdence calculation, ensures that the exact solution of two-
phase equilibrium will be found.
3. Results and discussion
The new phase equilibrium workﬂow (Fig. 4) was compared with the
classical workﬂow (Fig. 1) for the SPE3 mixture (Kenyon and Behie,
1987; Haugen and Beckner, 2013). Table 1 presents the SPE3 ﬂuid
characterization and Fig. 5 shows its phase envelope, simulated with the
Peng-Robinson equation of state (Robinson and Peng, 1978). The ki value
is the binary interaction coefﬁcient between the row component and i
component. This ﬂuid can be characterized as a light oil with 51� API and
850 sm3/sm3 solution gas-oil ratio.
This section is divided in three parts: in the ﬁrst two sub-sections we
check if the artiﬁcial intelligence algorithm learns two-phase thermo-
dynamic equilibrium results from constant global composition calcula-
tions and from a gasﬂooding recovery process. Last section compares the
computational time between the proposed neural network workﬂow and
the classical workﬂow.
3.1. Constant composition
For the constant composition case 10,000 classical ﬂash calculations
for SPE3 ﬂuid (Table 1) were performed changing pressure in the interval
p 2 ½2; 27� MPa and temperature in the interval T 2 ½240; 620� K. These
results were used as the training data set.
3.1.1. Phase identiﬁcation network
The best phase identiﬁcation network topology is composed by 4
layers with a total of 43 neurons, whose structure is ð8; 16; 16; 3Þ, where
each number indicates the number of neurons per layer. This optimum
topology was found by testing different architectures to maximize the
network accuracy using the minimum number of layers and neurons.
Fig. 6 compares the phase identiﬁcation envelope generated by the
classical workﬂow (used as training data) and the envelope obtained by
the neural network after training. Note that the uncertainty points (red)
appear in the phase transition region, and are less than 5.23% of total.

3.1.2. Two-phase ﬂash initial estimate network
The topology of the network that generates initial estimates for ﬂash
calculations is similar to the topology of the phase identiﬁcation network,
with 41 neurons distributed in 4 layers ð8; 16; 16; 1Þ. The Newton-
Raphson method depends on the initial estimates. So, to reduce the
number of iterations of the ﬂash algorithm (Equation (13)), it is impor-
tant to provide an estimate of logKi for each component as close as
possible to the solution. As an example, we compare the logKCO2 and
logKC71 obtained after equilibrium by the classical workﬂow, and esti-
mated by the proposed neural network method, the stability test
(Equation (5)), and the Wilson correlation (Equation (6)) (Figs. 7 and 8).
The neural network can learn the K-values of all components,
generating initial estimates for the ﬂash problem very close to the exact
solution, and reducing the number of ﬂash iterations. On the other hand
Wilson correlation provides poor estimates at high pressures causing
divergence when applied directly in the ﬂash algorithm. Note that there
is a discontinuity in the calculations using the stability test.
The discontinuous region in stability calculations is related with the
local minima in Equation (4). Depending if the algorithm starts the tests
with liquid like or vapor like composition ( Z! ¼ x! or Z! ¼ y!), the sta-
bility algorithm may converge to different logKi (Fig. 9). Fig. 9 presents
log KC71 after the convergence of liquid like and vapor like stability tests.
Note that there is an area where both algorithms result in unstable phases
with different compositions. Choice of vapor like composition in the
region of high liquid fractions (low temperature) can result in poor initial
estimates for Newton-Raphson algorithm. Note that the unstable region
for either liquid or vapor like stability tests are always smaller than the
phase envelope region, the main reason it is necessary to run both tests in
the classical workﬂow (Fig. 1).
Finally, Fig. 10 compares the vapor mole fraction calculated by the
EOS and the initial guess provided by the neural network. The initial

guess is close to the ﬂash by the EOS, an excellent approximation for the
ﬂash calculation even in regions close to the critical point.
3.2. Variable composition
Gas injection is a recovery process of liquid hydrocarbons that
changes the global composition of the reservoir ﬂuid. It increases nu-
merical simulation complexity because of the mass transfer. For example,
the composition and pressure variation in small cells close to injection
well may change the phase from oil to gas in one time step. So, it is
necessary to perform the stability test every time step using liquid-like
and vapor-like estimates.
To train the proposed neural network workﬂow for gasﬂooding
simulations scenario a numerical swelling test was created. This test
consists of mixing gas and oil at ﬁxed ratios, and measuring the volume
and composition of each phase after equilibrium.
The training data-set for the variable composition case was the
mixture of SPE3 oil (Table 1) with its own dissolved gas after a ﬂash
separation at standard conditions (Table 2). We created 11 different gas
fractions (αg), from pure oil (αg ¼ 0) to pure gas (αg ¼ 1) at constant steps
of αg ¼ 0.1 (Fig. 11). The same pressure and temperature regions
(p 2 ½2; 27� MPa and T 2 ½240; 620� K) were used for each mixture. Note
that for a ﬁxed gas fraction, the global composition is calculated by:
Z! ¼
�
1 � αg
�
x! þ αg y!
(18)
where x! and y! are the liquid and gas compositions (Table 2). The best
network topology for the swelling case is a ð9; 27; 27; 3Þ structure for the
phase identiﬁcation network and ð9; 27; 27; 1Þ for each initial estimate
for ﬂash calculation. These networks require more neurons when
compared with the constant composition case because of the variation of
the global composition input.
First we compare the vapor mole fraction (after the convergence of
the ﬂash algorithm using an EOS) with the estimates given by the neural
network and the result of the Rachford-Rice equation using Wilson cor-
relation (Equations (14) and (6)) for three different pressure and tem-
perature, changing the gas fraction (Fig. 12). As the system pressure
increases, Wilson correlation results are poorer, increasing the number of
iterations of the stability algorithm (Equation (5)). On the other hand, the
neural network avoids the stability test and provides excelent initial es-
timates for the two-phase ﬂash algorithm. The missing points in the
neural network curve for αg > 0.9, p ¼ 15 MPa and T ¼ 350 K are caused
by the low conﬁdence in the phase identiﬁcation network.
Fig. 13 presents similar results for logKCO2 and logKC73 and Fig. 14
shows all logKi values for a single p, T condition. For CO2 Wilson corre-
lation can generate good results, however it fails for heavy components,
like C73. The neural network provides good estimates for logKi in all
temperatures and pressures for all components. In many cases the ﬂash
calculations can be replaced by the neural network estimates. For αg >
0.6 at p ¼ 20 MPa and T ¼ 400 K, the mixture becomes single phase.
Figs. 15 and 16 compare V, logKCO2 and logKC73 for three different (αg,
T) conditions changing system pressure, while Figs. 17 and 18 compare
the same variables for three different (αg, p) conditions changing system
temperature. It is clear that Wilson correlation does not provide good
estimates for high (p, T) systems, leading to many iterations until
convergence of stability tests in the classical workﬂow, and slowing
compositional simulations. Use of proposed technique avoids the stabil-
ity test for almost 95% of the cases, and generates an initial estimate for
the ﬂash algorithm very close to the solution.

3.3. Speed-up results
The ﬁrst two sections showed that it is possible to use artiﬁcial in-
telligence to learn thermodynamic equilibrium variables. As discussed,
the proposed equilibrium workﬂow avoids the stability test for most
cases and provides initial estimates for the ﬂash calculation very close to
the solution. For the tested cases, the computational time spent in sta-
bility test is reduced by approximately 75%, and in the ﬂash algorithm by
50%.
Table 3 shows the number of iterations for some cases. These cases
where generated changing system pressure and temperature (grid size)
and calling both workﬂows for each one. The processing time reduction
was greater than 40% in all cases. For the ﬂash algorithm, the neural
network generated initial estimates so close to the ﬁnal result that in
some cases the solution was obtained after one iteration.
4. Conclusions
In this work we propose a new phase equilibrium workﬂow using
artiﬁcial intelligence to decrease the number and in most cases avoid the
stability test and speed-up the traditional ﬂash algorithm. The developed
technique generates initial estimates for the ﬂash calculation close to the
solution. This workﬂow may be applied in compositional reservoir sim-
ulators, where the classical ﬂash equilibrium calculations are performed
for each cell every time-step.
It was shown that small neural networks are necessary to learn the
phase equilibrium parameters, and the time spent to evaluate this
network is much smaller than the reduction of the ﬂash iterations and
avoiding stability calls. The neural network and the ﬁnal ﬂash results are
so close that in many cases the ﬂash routine is not necessary. However,
we built a robust workﬂow where the accuracy of equilibrium equations
is achieved in every run, avoiding error propagation in reservoir simu-
lation. We compared the processing time between the classical and the
neural network workﬂows, the use of artiﬁcial intelligence decreased the
time around 50%.
