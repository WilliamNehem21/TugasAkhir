Abstract 
In view of using only the intensity information of retroreflection wave and poor capacity of anti-interference in laser 
short-range detection, this paper analyzes the polarization characteristics of laser beam on the metal surface and 
establishes reflection model of polarized laser. A target detection method based on polarization characteristics of 
reflection laser is putted forward and the simulation of polarization characteristics on the surface of several typical metal 
targets is implemented at last.

1. Introduction 
Short-range detection with laser usually irradiates target by using laser beam and obtains target distance 
according to the intensity information of retroreflection wave. However, target and background objects usually 
intermix together in complex battlefield environment, and the laser reflected by background objects cause 
false alarm frequently when detecting target. Because of using only the intensity information of laser for 
detection, it is difficult for the detector to effectively distinguish between target and background objects, and

the anti-interference capability of detection system is low. As an important attribute of laser as well as 
intensity, frequency and coherent, polarization effectively expand the laser detection information dimension 
and has attracted great attention widely in the world, and research focus distributes in military target detection 
[1] [2] [3], remote sensing [4] [5], medical imaging [6] and other fields. Domestic research on laser 
polarization is also mainly focused on these fields and pays little attention to short-range detection, especially 
detection model, of ground objects. This paper mainly models and analyzes the laser polarization 
characteristic on the surface of metal target, and the simulation of polarization characteristics on the surface of 
several typical metal targets is also implemented. 
2. The stokes polarization parameters 
Any polarization state of light, including completely polarized light, unpolarized light and partly polarized 
light, can be completely described by stokes parameters [S0;S1;S2;S3]. Because of monochromatic 
approximation for a plane wave, the Stokes parameters of polarized laser are obtained from the formulas:

3. Polarization reflection characteristics of metal target 
The surface of metal target is quite smooth, and the echo consists mainly of low-order reflection 
component. Thus, this paper only considers polarization reflection characteristics, without considering higher-
order scattering caused by rough surface. 
3.1. Polarization reflection model of metal target 
Because of conductivity 
0, metal is lossy dielectric. Part of the electromagnetic energy is transformed 
to heat and consumed. Therefore, Fresnel s equations for reflection becomes [8]

3.2. Muller matrix description of reflection on metal surface 
According to the above analysis of reflection characteristics on metal surface, both the reflectivity and the 
phase of s and p components change in different degrees. In general, incident linear polarized laser beam 
becomes elliptically polarized on reflection from metal. According to the definition of stokes parameters, the 
changes of polarization on reflection from metal can be described by Muller matrix which can represent the 
process of reflection. Assuming that the Stokes vector of the incident light is

3.3. Detection principle using polarization 
Due to the differences in object material, roughness of surface, laser wavelength and incident angle, the 
polarization of reflected light changes in different degrees. By detecting the Stokes parameters of reflected 
light, the information of target can be extracted and the target can be detected from background objects.

Figure 2 Principle of short-range detection using polarization laser 
As shown in Figure 2, linearly polarized laser irradiates the surface of metal, and the detector receives the 
reflected light. The transmission axes of polarizer s and p are orthogonal. Therefore, the detectors s and p 
receive s and p components of reflected light respectively and output voltage signals. According to the signals, 
332  
 Yu-ying Yang et al. /  AASRI Procedia  3 ( 2012 )  328 – 334 
 
the reflectivity of s and p components can be calculated and then different materials, including metal and 
nonmetal, will be distinguished.  
4. Simulations for polarization reflection characterize of typical metal 
The formula (5), which represents the reflectivity and the phase changes of reflected polarized light on the 
surface of metal, only has one variable 
1. As the 
1 changes, the reflectivity and the phase on s and p 
direction also change. According to formula (5), the reflectivity and angle changes of reflected light on copper, 
aluminum, iron, steel and water can be calculated, and the related optical parameters are shown in table 1.

Figure 3 shows plots of reflectivity variations. When 
1=0
or 
1=90
the reflectivity on s and p 
directions of each material have the same value. Because of different materials, the initial values of these 
materials are not the same, and the initial reflectivity of metal is obviously higher than the water s. Meanwhile, 
initial values of these metals are not the same, and aluminum has the highest while iron has the lowest. All of 
the values of s component increase until unity with the incident angle increases, and the curve of water is the 
most violent in the five. As the incident angle increases, the values of p component decrease at first, and 
subsequently increase after some angle; the curve of water is also the most violent in the five.

When the laser beam irradiates onto the surface of target, the energy is redistributed on the s and p 
directions. The energy of s and p components is different because of different materials, and the difference 
between s and p component is also not the same. As shown in figure 4(a), Y-axis is the value of Rs minus Rp, 
and the differences increase with the incident angle increases, and the order of differences from largest to 
smallest is iron, steel, cooper, aluminum and water. As shown in figure 4(b), Y-axis is the ration between Rs 
and Rp, and the ratios of different materials become more obvious with the incident angle increases. The 
maximum ratio of iron is nearly six times the size of the maximum ratio of aluminum.

5. Conclusions 
From the simulations for polarization reflection characteristics of different materials, two conclusions can 
be reached without considering the scattering components on the smooth surface of metal: 
334  
 Yu-ying Yang et al. /  AASRI Procedia  3 ( 2012 )  328 – 334 
 
(1) The reflectivity and the phase on s and p directions will change and the degrees of changes are different 
because of materials when the polarized laser irradiates the surface of metal.   
(2) From figures 3, 4, 5, the polarization reflection characterizes of magnetic metal, nonmagnetic metal and 
nonmetal can be used to distinguish the material of the object. Combined with the reflected light intensity 
information, the detector can be more effective to distinguish different objects.
