Abstract 
Low quality rubies are usually undergone heat treatment to improve their color and clarity. Some chemical 
additives may have been added during the treatment. Consequently, some toxic elements, particular lead, have 
been concerned as well as durability of the treated stones. Lead leachates from treated ruby have therefore 
been investigated; besides, changes of color and clarity have also been observed throughout the experiment. 
Three-Stage Sequential Extraction Procedure (BCR) was applied for leaching experiment. This process 
consists of 3 steps including BCR1 (exchangeable step), BCR2 (reduction step) and BCR3 (oxidation step). 
This procedure has been suggested to represent natural processes that may altered materials including 
hazardous one. Apart from regular procedure, we also rearrange the step orders. This aims to find out the most 
effective condition of lead leaching. The results indicate that the most effective step seems to be BCR 3 which 
is an aggressive reaction compared to the other steps. However, BCR 2 also yields the highest lead 
concentration after activating initially by BCR I in series I. On the other hand, BCR1 is unable to extract lead 
from the treated ruby. Moreover, the appearances of rubies in each series have been altered towards the 
experimental steps and well corresponded to the concentrations of lead in leachate.

1. Introduction 
Thailand is a world famous market of colored stone. This is because of the good quality of natural 
gemstones sources, especially ruby and sapphire, together with the skilled craftsman for gem cutting as well 
as professional jewelry design and setting. Recently, good quality gem materials have reduced against 
increasing of price. This situation makes the lower quality gem material attracted the suppliers since their 
quality can be improved by heating process. According to the process heating with gas feeding, the changes in 
chemical structure of trace elements inside the stone may improve their color and clarity; this process is then 
so-
classical 
 [Chucharuwong, 1999]. This process has been widely accepted in 
the international gem markets, although a few chemical additives such as borax may also be added during the 
heat treatment for crack healing and consequent clarity improvement. However, heat treatments have been 
modified for a few decades; some chemical additives may have been added in the process with trial and error 
by the gem treaters. These also include lead glass which may lead environmental impact, particular human 
health, in case they can be altered by natural process and/or daily chemical reactions.   
Up to date, none of organization has paid attentions to the harmful of the chemical residue left in these 
treated gemstones. Normally, these chemicals are possibly leached out during human daily life such as 
slightly acidic conditions (pH less than 7) when exposure to lime and lemon juices (pH 2.0-2.5), beer (pH 4.5-
5.0), orange juice (pH 3.0-3.5) [Nueanuansuwan, 2006] cow milk (pH 6.4-6.8) [Chuanchuen and Amonsin, 
2006]. Moreover, human skins may also change slightly to acidic condition when sweat is excreted. Reducing 
conditions on skin can be happened by surrounding hydrogen and carbon dioxide. Utilities of toxic or 
corrosive chemicals in everyday life , such as calcium hypochlorite (Ca(OCl2)2) in cloth bleaching, sodium 
chlorate (NaClO3) in paper bleaching,  disinfectant in tap water or swimming pool as well as oxygen gas in 
atmosphere, may leach oxidizing condition.  
In this study, Three-Stage  Sequential  Extraction  Procedure or  BCR test which has been suggested by   
the Standard, Measurements  and Testing program (SM&T),  formerly  called  the  
 [Rauret et al., 1999] was applied for the leaching procedure of treated rubies claimed as classical heat 
treatment.  This method has been used to determine heavy metal concentrations, especially cadmium, 
chromium, copper, lead, manganese, nickel, vanadium and zinc in soil or sediment. BCR three stages
composed of exchangeable, reduction, and oxidation steps. Kanjanabut et al., [2010] investigated the lead 
contents in lead glass-treated ruby from two companies and found that the lead contents increased towards 
steps of testing due to more corrosion of gems. However, in natural conditions, these three steps of leaching 
do not continuously occur in order. Therefore, this study was planned to alternate steps of the suggested 
sequences and investigated the effect of leaching steps to the lead content obtained.  
2. Material and Method 
2.1. Sample Source 
Treated rubies were collected from 7 factories, nine stones of each factories which they announce classical 
heat treatment. 
2.2 Three-Stage Sequential Extraction Procedure (BCR)  
Each treated ruby was followed the leaching procedure of three-stage sequential extraction procedure 
(BCR), including: 1) Exchangeable step (BCR 1), 40 ml acetic acid (0.11 mol/l-1) was added, followed by16 h 
shaking; 2) Reduction (BCR 2), 40 ml hydroxylamine hydrochloride (0.5 mol/l-1) was added, followed by16 h 
shaking  and 3) Oxidation (BCR 3), 10 ml hydrogen peroxide (8.8 mol/l-1) was added, followed by heating at 
80±2ºC using hotplate until volume reduced to 3 ml, then 10 ml hydrogen peroxide (8.8 mol/l-1) was added 
396  
 Patcharin Lekkar et al. /  AASRI Procedia  3 ( 2012 )  394 – 401 
and further heating at 80±2ºC until 1 ml of solution remained, ammonium acetate (1.0 mol/l-1) was finally 
added to adjust the volume to 50 ml followed by 16 h shaking.   
2.3 Sequential Orders 
Sequential orders of BCR procedures were divided into 3 series as shown in Table 1 
Table 1 Experimental series of BCR step procedures 
 
 
 
2.4. Lead Concentration 
All solutions obtained from leaching steps were analyzed for lead concentration using Atomic Absorption 
Spectrometer (Perkin Elmer, Analyst 800). 
2.5. Ruby Appearance 
Observations of the gemmological appearance were carried out and photographed before and after all 
leaching steps. 
3. Results and Discussion 
The results of lead concentration (Tables 2-8) extracted from each series are described below. 
3.1. Series I (BCR 1, BCR2 and BCR 3) 
According to Series I, the highest lead concentrations leached from treated ruby seems to be extracted from 
BCR 2 (reduction step) except samples from factories 5 and 6 which BCR 3 gave more effect. The amounts of 
lead extracted from each step agreed well with the gemmological appearance which number of cracks was 
clearly appeared after passing BCR 2. 
3.2. Series II (BCR 2, BCR3 and BCR 1) amount of lead leached 
BCR 3 (oxidation step) yielded significantly the highest lead concentration among the other steps. In 
addition, cracking in rubies is clearly seen in this step. However, samples from factories 1 and 7 seem to be 
exception.  
BCR extraction appear to have no effect to treated rubies from factory 7 which lead concentration and 
cracking could not be observed throughout the tests.

Fig.1 Comparison of gemological appearance of ruby and lead leached from BCR step (represented by samples of factory 2) 
3.3. Series III (BCR 3, BCR1 and BCR 2) a 
BCR 3 (oxidation step) usually yielded the highest effect on extraction. Except samples from factories 1 
and 7, BCR 1 obtained higher lead concentrations than those of BCR3. For samples of factories 2 to 6, cracks 
of rubies were appeared significantly by BCR3 step which they are compatible to lead concentrations in 
leachate. On the other hand, samples of factories 1 and 7 were clearly cracked after BCR1 test. 
The extraction of lead and cracking can be representatively shown and compared by samples from factory 
2 (Fig. 1). 
4. Conclusions 
(1) It is noticeable that ruby undergone classical heat treatment process, which were claimed to have no  
lead compound, may yield lead contents ranging from  0-162 mg/kg 
(2) According to series I, treated rubies yield the highest lead content in BCR 2. For series II, BCR 2 has 
been carried out initially but it yield lower lead contents than that obtained from series I. This can suggest that 
BCR 2 may yield higher efficiency after activated by other BCR steps. 
(3) Results from all experimental series suggest that the most effective step seems to be BCR 3.  
(4) On the other hand, BCR1 has the least efficiency.
