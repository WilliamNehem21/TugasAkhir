To improve the low transplanting efﬁciencies and simplify the complex structures of current automatic trans-
planters, a mechanical high-speed transplanter for picking plug seedlings that is suitable for planting on plastic
ﬁlms was designed. The main components were an automatic seedling picking system and a basket-type planting
system, which were used for the following processes: automatic picking, planting, soil covering, and suppression
of plug seedlings. The performance test was performed on the automatic transplanter with 60-day-old pepper
seedlings. The transplanting efﬁciency was tested at speeds of 40, 60, 90, and 120 plants·min−1. The results
showed that the coefﬁcient of variation (CV) of the plant spacing and the missed transplanting rate increased
with the planting frequency, whereas the qualiﬁed rate of planting perpendicularity and the qualiﬁed rate of
planting decreased with the increase in the planting frequency. All planting indices met the JB/T 102912013 stan-
dards. The results of this study showed that the auto-transplanter could perform high-speed transplanting on the
basis of completing the following functions: automatic picking, planting, soil covering, and suppression of plug
seedlings.

Transplanting seedlings is an important task in crop production.
Using transplants rather than direct seeding can avoid natural disasters,
such as low temperatures and cold in spring, improving the survival rate
of seedlings and the quality of crops (Brewer, 1994; Syed et al., 2019). At
present, the transplanting machinery in China is still based on semi-
automatic transplanting technology. The seedling planting mainly
depends on manual processes (Choi et al., 2001; Han et al., 2019a),
which suffer from low efﬁciency and high labor requirements and
costs. Thus, it is urgent to design an automatic transplanting machine
to replace the manual picking and discharging of seedlings (Han et al.,
2019b; Yu et al., 2012).
Research on automatic transplanting machines has been previously
reported (Yu et al., 2014). The Ferrari company in Italy developed the
Futural series automatic transplanter based on the domestic agronomy,
and it can automatically complete the picking and planting of ﬁve
rows of plug tray seedlings with a planting frequency of 130
plants·row−1·min−1 (Ni et al., 2015; Prasanna Kumar and Raheman,
2011). The automatic transplanting machine developed by the British
Pearson company takes the seedlings out of the seedling trays using
the seedling needles and places them horizontally on a conveyor belt.
The plug seedlings are sequentially sent to the soil through the conveyor
belt. The planting frequency is 100–135 plants·row−1·min−1 (Wang
et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2013). The HDl44 automatic transplanter devel-
oped by the Transplant Systems in Australia can complete the trans-
plantation of six rows of plug seedlings with a planting frequency of
100 plants·row−1 min−1 (Kutz et al., 1987). The three aforementioned
transplanters perform ditched transplanting. In Japan, plots are small,
and most of the transplanters developed there punch holes in a plastic
mulch ﬁlm (Shaw, 1993), such as the PA1A developed by Yanmar and
the SKP-100 T automatic transplanter developed by Kubota, which
pick up the plug seedlings with an end effector and cooperate with
the planter to push the plug seedlings into the soil. This machine has a
compact structure, precise movement, and a planting frequency of up
to 50 plants·row−1·min−1 (Hu et al., 2016; Han et al., 2018; Han
et al., 2016a). However, the transplanter has only two rows of opera-
tions and the mechanism is complex; thus, it is less efﬁcient than the
three types of automatic transplanters mentioned above (Han et al.,
2013; Yang et al., 2018; Tian et al., 2010).
Presently, the use of automatic transplanting machines is not popu-
lar in China, mainly due to the complicated mechanical structures and
high production costs, and it is difﬁcult to combine agricultural machin-
ery and agronomics effectively (Yu et al., 2011). Therefore, the
transplanting frequency of transplanting machines is generally low.

An automatic transplanter was designed by Yan of Jiangsu University
with a maximum transplanting efﬁciency of 60 plants·row−1·min−1
(Yan et al., 2013). The structure of the seedling pick-up component is
mainly driven by CAM, which wears out over time, thus reducing the
precision of the whole machine (Han et al., 2015; Han et al., 2016b).
The automatic transplanting machine developed by Han of Jiangsu Uni-
versity has a transplanting frequency of 60 plants·row−1·min−1. Be-
cause most of the seedling-picking devices use electrical control
systems, electrical problems occur during transplanting, which cannot
be solved in a timely manner by farmers, so the adoption of these
devices is limited (Liu et al., 2016). The transplanting efﬁciency of
the 2ZXM-2 automatic plastic ﬁlm mulching plug seedling trans-
planter for vegetables developed by Li of Shi Hezi University is 62
plants·row−1·min−1 (Li et al., 2017). Due to the limited number of ma-
nipulators used to pick seedlings, it cannot meet the supply require-
ments of 90 plants·row−1·min−1 for high-speed transplanting (Tai
et al., 1994; Xu and Tang, 2019).
Based on the above analysis, to achieve high-speed transplanting of
plug seedlings, a mechanical high-speed transplanting machine for plug
seedlings is designed in this paper that can operate on a plastic ﬁlm
mulch, which can complete the functions of automatic picking, deliver-
ing, planting, soil covering, and suppression of plug seedlings during
transplanting operations.
1. Materials and methods
1.1. Overall structure
The high-speed seedling auto-transplanter is mainly composed of
an automatic seedling picking system and the basket-type planting
system (Fig. 1). A ground wheel drives the basket-type planting sys-
tem, which completes the transplanting process, and the automatic
seedling picking system is responsible for continuously supplying
plug seedlings to the basket-type planting system. The automatic
seedling picking system is symmetric on both sides, which allows
for ﬁlm and double line reciprocating seedling picking. There is a
ﬁxed transmission ratio between the planting system and the auto-
matic seedling picking system to ensure that the seedlings are accu-
rately fed into the seedling cups. Its speciﬁc design parameters are
presented in Table 1.
1.1.1. Structural schematic of automatic seedling picking system
The main parts of the automatic seedling picking system include
the lifting rod, seedling guide, locking mechanism, manipulator,
frame, pressure plate, adjusting bolt, feeding mechanism, and trans-
mission mechanism, which have a left–right symmetric arrangement.
When the assembly of the manipulator moves to the discharge
position of the plug seedling, the pressure plate presses the seedling
rod to the bottom of the locking mechanism, and the manipulator
opens and disperses with the guide groove of the seedling guide.
When the manipulator returns to the seedling picking position, it
closes with the guide groove of the seedling guide until the adjusting
bolt and the locking mechanism touch, causing the lifting rod to lose
the restriction of the locking mechanism; at this point, the lifting
rod drives the manipulator to pick up the seedlings. The seedling feed-
ing mechanism moves step by step, waiting for the next picking step
(Fig. 2).
1.2. Manipulator
The structure of the manipulator is shown in Fig. 3. A compression
spring is installed between adjacent clips, and one end is hinged to the
slider. The slider can be moved up and down along the slide bar.
When the slider moves upward, the clip is driven to move upward
along the guide rod. At this time, the clips overcome the elastic force
of the compression spring and the pressing force of the limit bearing,
forcing the clips to close and completing the clamping of the plug seed-
ling. When the slider continues to move upward along the guide rod,
the two clips maintain a balanced force under the action of the compres-
sion spring and the limit bearing, and the clamping force remains un-
changed until the slider moves up to the top of the ﬁxed base. When
the slider moves down to the bottom of the ﬁxed base, the limit bearing
is exactly tangent to the depression of the clip. At this time, the clip loses
the limitation of the limit bearing and is bounced off by the compression
spring. Finally, the plug seedlings are accurately put into the basket-type
planting system.
1.2.1. Analysis of manipulator
The force analysis is conducted when the manipulator clip is closed
to pick seedlings (Fig. 3a). The spring force of the compression spring,
the extrusion force of the limit bearing, and the reaction force of the
stem work together to reach a force balance, and the force analysis is
as follows:

A to E (mm), G is the gravitational force of the plug seedlings (N), Ffr is
friction between the clamp and seedling stem (N), and Fft is the friction
between the matrix and acupoint disc (N).
When discharging the seedlings (Fig. 3b), the force analysis of the
gripper of the manipulator is as follows:

where FS´ is the reaction force of the compression spring on the clip (N),
μN is the coefﬁcient of friction between the clip and limit bearing, Ff is
the force of friction between the clip and limit bearing (N), and FP is
the lifting force of the clips (N).
When the manipulator grips the seedlings, FC and FC´ are a pair of
opposing forces, the force of the plug seedling is as follows:
2 � Ffr≥Fft þ G
Fft ¼ η � S
�
ð3Þ
where η is the viscosity coefﬁcient of matrix and plug tray hole (Feng
et al., 2013), and S is the contact area between the matrix and plug
tray hole.
The clip dimensions are deﬁned as follows: lAB was 22 mm, lAD was
98.3 mm, and lAE was 120 mm. The other measurable parameters
were as follows: FC was 23 N, G was 0.3 N, S was 34.2 cm2, and η was
0.04 N·cm−2. Based on Eq. (1), the pulling force of the manipulator on
the plug seedlings FP was 3.34 N, and elastic force FS was 6.5 N.
1.2.2. Compression spring design
When the manipulator reaches the position to pick and discharge
the seedlings, the compression spring acts quickly to achieve the pre-
cise clamping and discharging of the plug seedlings. If the spring stiff-
ness is too small, the clips cannot be opened in time when the
manipulator discharges the plug seedlings. As a result, plug seedlings
cannot be fed into the basket-type planting system accurately. If the
spring stiffness is too large, when the manipulator is used to clamp
the plug seedlings, a greater lifting force is required to remove the
plug seedlings. Therefore, the design of a reasonable spring structure
parameters is important to improve the precision of the manipulator
plug seedlings. Considering that the compression spring must exhibit
a high strength and good performances, a C-grade carbon spring
steel wire was selected. According to the mechanical design manual,
the diameter of the compression spring wire d0 was estimated to be
1 mm, so the bending stress σB was 1800 MPa, and the spring index
C was 10. The speciﬁc structural parameters of the compression spring
can be calculated as follows:

where the shear modulus G was 80,000 MPa, the maximum deforma-
tion λmax was 20 mm, and Δ was 0.29 mm. Eqs. (4)–(6) show that the
diameter d of the compression spring wire was 0.5 mm, the mean
diameter D of the spring was 6 mm, the pitch t of the spring was
2.13 mm, and effective working circle n was 15.
1.3. Locking mechanism
The opening and closing of the manipulator is determined by the
locking mechanism, which is composed of a tension spring, slide panels,
a separation rod, a return spring, and closed bearing bases (Fig. 4a).
After the manipulator picks up seedlings at point C, the locking mecha-
nism can keep the manipulator always closed during the C → A process.
When the manipulator moves to point A, the pressure plate presses the
lifting rod to the bottom of the slide panels, then the return spring resets
the separation rod. The manipulator will open all the way during the
A → C process, until the adjusting bolt touches the separation rod at
point C. At this time, the seedling lifting rod loses the restriction of the
separation rod, then the lifting rod will be dependent on the tension
spring to complete the picking of the plug seedling (Fig. 4b).
1.4. Seedling guide
When picking seedlings, each plug seedling is required to be within
the gripping range of the manipulator. When seedlings are discharged,
each plug seedling can be aligned with the center of the rotating seed-
ling cup. According to the plug tray parameters, the center distance of
the guide groove at the end of picking and the spacing of guide grooves
at the end of discharging can be determined, that is, h = 63.5 mm and
H = 127 mm (Fig. 5).
The center lines of the guide grooves aO, bO, cO, and dO extend from
point O. The seedling guide uses OO’ as the axis of symmetry to separate
the guide grooves with a certain inclination angle. It is known from the
geometric relationship in Fig. 5 that
lO0d ¼ 1
3 lO0c ¼ 1
5 lO0b ¼ 1
7 lO0a
ð7Þ
Therefore, to realize the equidistant expansion and closing of the
seedling picking manipulator, the inclination angle of the guide groove
must satisfy the following:
tan θ1 : tan θ2 : tan θ3 : tan θ4 ¼ 1 : 3 : 5 : 7
ð8Þ
1.5. Transmission mechanism
The transmission mechanism is mainly composed of the manipula-
tor reciprocating mechanism, the gear train, the transmission case,
and the support frame (Fig. 6).
The gear train is installed on the support frame, and the transmission
ratio is 1:2. One end of the manipulator reciprocating mechanism is con-
nected to the manipulator, and the other end is connected to the gear
train and the output shaft of the transmission case. When the manipu-
lator picks up the plug seedlings, the transmission case drives the
crank to rotate, so that the manipulator picks up and discharges the
plug seedlings back and forth.
1.5.1. Kinematic analysis of manipulator reciprocating mechanism
The essential component of the manipulator reciprocating mecha-
nism is the crank slider mechanism. The crank rotates around point A
to C′, the manipulator picks seedlings at point C, and the crank rotates

around point A to point B′. The manipulator then moves to point C′ to
discharge the seedlings (Fig. 7).
The travel velocity-ratio coefﬁcient K was 1, the extreme position
angle was 0°, and there was no sharp return phenomenon. According
to the movement and installation requirements of the mechanism
(Sun et al., 2015), the slider motion stroke LCC′ was 635 mm. To ensure
that the mechanism provided good transmission and had a minimum
structural size, the transmission angle γmin was 40°. The length of the
connecting rod can be obtained from the following formulas:
LCC ¼ 2LAB
ð9Þ
LBC ¼
LAB
cos γ min
ð10Þ
λ ¼ LAB
LBC
ð11Þ
where LAB was 318 mm, LBC was 415 mm, and λ = 0.8 is the connecting
rod transmission ratio.
From the geometric relationship in Fig. 7, the displacement expres-
sion between the slider's movement position and the farthest extreme
position at any time can be obtained by the following formula:

1.5.2. Simulation analysis
To determine the output torque of the transmission case, the maxi-
mum transplanting frequency was set to 120 plants·min−1, and the
crank speed was 1.57 rad·s−1, which were substituted into Eq. (14) to
simulate the motion state of the slider (Su, 2014). MATLAB was used
to calculate the motion state of the slider at any time (Pan, 2015).
In the interval (0, π), the slider moved away, and when the crank
was turned to π, the movement speed dropped to 0 m·s−1. At this
time, the manipulator picked multiple seedlings. In the interval
(π, 2π), the slider reversed movement, and when the crank was turned
to 2π, the movement speed dropped to 0 m·s−1 from Fig. 8(a). At this
time, the manipulator discharged multiple seedlings.
As shown in Fig. 8(b), the acceleration of the slider was greater than
0 m·s−2, and the force of the connecting rod on the slider was greater
than the force of friction on the slider. When the crank angle θ1 was π
3,
the maximum slider acceleration was 1.25 m·s−2. It is known that the
mass of the crank slider mechanism driving part was 18 kg, and the slid-
ing friction coefﬁcient μ was taken as 0.2. Thus, the minimum output
torque of the transmission case satisﬁed the following:
F � sinθ1‐f ¼ m � a max
f ¼ m � g � μ
Mmin ¼ F � LAB
8
<
:
ð15Þ
where F is the driving force of the crank (N), f is the frictional force on
the slider (N), and Mmin is the minimum driving force of the transmis-
sion case (N·m). According to Eq. (15), because the crank slider mech-
anism was symmetrically distributed on the left and right sides, the
minimum torque required by the transmission case was 42.4 N·m.
1.6. Feeding mechanism
The seedling tray conveying mechanism is mainly composed of a
pallet, chain cross rod, pressure plate, ratchet, and underframe (Fig. 9).
The pallet is ﬁxed on the underframe to support the plug seedling
tray. The power is input by the ratchet, and the drive shaft is driven by
the ratchet for intermittent rotation. The drive shaft drives the chain
cross rod to move, making the plug seedling tray step shift. The platen
above the ratchet is used to keep the seedling tray tightly attached to
the pallet to prevent the seedling tray from shifting when the machine
shakes. The seedling tray is placed between the pallet and the platen,
the V-shaped gap of the seedling tray is stuck on the chain cross rods,

68
and the seedling tray can be stepped on the pallet with the chain
cross rods.
1.6.1. Ratchet
The stepping movement of the seedling tray is controlled by a
ratchet, and the power is input by the pawl support, which drives
the coaxial sprocket to rotate stepwise, and the chain cross rod drives
the seedling tray to feed longitudinally (Fig. 10). The distance that the
plug tray moves is equal to the arc length of the sprocket, and the central
angle of the sprocket is equal to the central angle α of the ratchet. The
plug tray has eight holes longitudinally, and the distance between adja-
cent holes l is 31.75 mm. The number of ratchet teeth n is 8, and the
modulus m is 6. The driving sprocket radius R and sprocket rotation
angle θ satisﬁes the following conditions:
1
n � 2πR ¼ l
ð16Þ
θ ¼ 360∘
n
¼ 45∘
ð17Þ
From Eqs. (16) and (17), the radius R of the sprocket is 40.45 mm.
Each time the ratchet moves, the sprocket rotates 45°, and the plug
tray feeds 31.75 mm intermittently.
2. Performance test
To evaluate the working performance of the automatic transplanter,
performance tests were conducted in Ningjin County, Shandong Prov-
ince, China, in June 2019. Before the ﬁeld experiments, the land was re-
quired to be ploughed completely ﬂat without large soil blocks, stones,
straw, or weeds. The quality of the cultivated land met the requirements
of planting agronomy, and the soil moisture content was about 15%. The
transplanted object was a 128-cell-type pepper plug seedling tray, and
the growth characteristics met the standards in Table 2.
The planting mode of this machine was “one ﬁlm double rows,” the
plant spacing Xr was adjusted to 0.25 m, and the row spacing was
0.43 m. During the whole operation, one operator was needed to install
the plug seedling tray (Fig. 11).
2.1. Evaluation indices
According to the JB/T 10291–2013 standard, the machine was
transplanted at a low speed at planting frequencies of 40, 60, and 90
plants·min−1 to verify the basic performance. It was then increased to
120 plants·min−1 to observe the operation effect during high-speed
transplanting. Each time 128 plants were transplanted in a single row,
the ﬁrst 8 plants were removed, and the next 120 were continuously
tested. The number of missed, replanted, lodging, exposed, buried, and
injured seedlings were then counted, and the main performance indices
were calculated, such as the coefﬁcient of variation (CV) of the plant
spacing, missing transplanting rate, qualiﬁed rate of planting perpendic-
ularity, and qualiﬁed rate of planting.
2.1.1. Coefﬁcient of variation (CV) of plant spacing
The distance Xi of two adjacent seedlings on the ground intersection
Xi was measured, and the difference between the actual measured plant
spacing Xi and the designed plant spacing Xr was calculated. The coefﬁ-
cient of variation for the plant spacing (CVX) is determined as follows:

where SX is the standard deviation of the plant spacing (cm), and X is
the average value of the plant spacing (cm).
2.1.2. Missing transplanting rate
When the projected distance Xi between two adjacent seedlings and
the intersection point of the ground was within the range of
1.5Xr < Xi ≤ 2.5Xr, one seedling was recorded as missing; when
2.5Xr < Xi ≤ 3.5Xr, two plants were missing, and so on. The evaluation
indices of the degree of missing seedlings was the rate of missing seed-
lings M:

where NLZ is the number of missed plants, and N´ is the number of
designed plants in the measurement section.
2.1.3. Qualiﬁed rate of planting perpendicularity
The angle between the main stem of the seedling and the ground
was less than 30°. The lodging was evaluated as follows:

relative to the number of designed plants was the qualiﬁed rate of
planting Q, which can be calculated as follows:
NHG ¼ N− NLZ þ NCZ þ NDF þ NMM þ NLM þ NSM
ð
Þ
Q ¼ NHG
N0 � 100%
(
ð21Þ
where NHG is the number of successes in planting the seedlings, N is the
total number of planted seedlings, NCZ is the number of repeated
planted seedlings, NMM is the number of covered planted seedlings,
NLM is the exposed number of planted seedlings, and NSM is the damaged
number of planted seedlings.
3. Results and discussion
When
the
planting
frequency
increased
from
40
to
90
plants·min−1 for low-speed transplanting, the CV increased from
6.5% to 6.7%, which was less than the national standard value of
15%. The highest missed planting rate was only 2.5%, which was
less than the national standard value of 5%. The minimum qualiﬁed
rate of planting perpendicularity was 98%, which was higher than
93%. The minimum qualiﬁed rate of planting was 97.2%, which
was higher than 90% It can be seen from Table 3. Thus, the low-
speed transplanting process of this machine had a good effect and
could meet the pre-set working requirements.
When the machine was transplanted at a high-speed of 120
plants·min−1, the CV was 9.4%, M was 3%, L was 97.5%, and Q was
97.5%. Compared with low-speed transplanting, the CV and M increased
slightly, and L and Q decreased. However, all the indices met the JB/T
10291–2013 standard. This showed that in the process of high-speed
planting, the automatic transplanter could achieve high speeds in
terms of picking, planting, and soil covering of the plug seedlings.
4. Conclusions
The aim of this study was to solve the problems of a low
transplanting efﬁciency and complicated seedling picking mechanisms
by designing a mechanical high-speed transplanter for picking seedlings
suitable for plastic ﬁlm transplanting. The machine consists of an auto-
matic seedling picking system and a basket-type planting system, which
can automatically complete the functions of picking plug seedlings,
planting, and covering soil.
By analyzing the force when the manipulator picked the plug seed-
lings, the structural parameters of the compression spring were deter-
mined. The kinematics and dynamics of the reciprocating mechanism
were analyzed, and the relationship between the velocity and accelera-
tion of the manipulator was obtained using MATLAB when the planting
frequency was 120 plants·min−1. The minimum output torque of the
transmission case was 42.4 N·m−1.
The mechanical high-speed transplanter for picking seedlings at
low speeds veriﬁed the basic performance. We then attempted to in-
crease the planting frequency to 120 plants·min−1 for high-speed
transplanting, under which the coefﬁcient of variation for the plant
spacing was 9.4%, the rate of missed planting was 3%, the qualiﬁed
rate of planting perpendicularity was 97.5%, and the qualiﬁed rate of
planting was 97.5%. All indices met the JB/T 10291–2013 requirements.
The results showed that the auto-transplanter could achieve high-speed
transplanting based on the completion of the basic functions of auto-
matic picking, planting, soil covering, and suppression.
