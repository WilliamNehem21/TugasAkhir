Food quality assessments
Background: An e-nose or an e-tongue is a group of gas sensors or chemical sensors that simulate human nose or
human tongue. Both e-nose and e-tongue have shown great promise and utility in improving assessments of food
quality characteristics compared with traditional detection methods.
Scope and approach: This review summarizes the application of e-nose and e-tongue in determining the
quality-related properties of foods. The working principles, applications, and limitations of the sensors employed
by electronic noses and electronic tongues were introduced and compared. Widely employed pattern recognition
algorithms, including artiﬁcial neural network (ANN), convolutional neural network (CNN), principal component
analysis (PCA), partial least square regression (PLS), and support vector machine (SVM), were introduced and
compared in this review.
Key ﬁndings and conclusions: Overall, e-nose or e-tongue combining pattern recognition algorithms are very pow-
erful analytical tools, which are relatively low-cost, rapid, and accurate. E-nose and e-tongue are also suitable for
both in-line and off-line measurements, which are very useful in monitoring food processing and detecting the
end product quality. The user of e-nose and e-tongue need to strictly control sample preparation, sampling,
and data processing.

1. Introduction
A e-nose or e-tongue is combination of gas sensors or chemical sen-
sors which mimics human nose or human tongue. Gas sensor arrays are
deﬁned as ‘electronic nose (e-nose),’ while chemical sensor arrays are
referred to as ‘electronic tongue (e-tongue)’. (Orlandi et al., 2019). Typ-
ically, rapid sensing can be achieved by those sensor arrays, and the
price of a sensor array is relatively lower than the standard analytical
equipment, such as gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–
MS), laser scatting analyzer, and high-performance liquid chromatogra-
phy (HPLC). Sensor arrays have broad applications in determining food
quality-related properties, such as sensory attributes, microbiological
properties, and processing quality (Matindoust et al., 2016). Those ap-
plications are achieved with the help of sensor arrays combined with
corresponding data pattern recognition approaches and classiﬁcation
algorithms.
Many attentions have been focused on the applications of e-nose
and e-tongue in food quality determination. In previous review and re-
search publications, the working principles of e-nose and e-tongue, and
their applications in determining the quality of foods were introduced
(Ali et al., 2020; Matindoust et al., 2016). However, detailed information
on each commonly used sensor and its working principles were not
discussed. The working principles of pattern recognition algorithms
employed by e-nose and e-tongue were mentioned in many previous
studies (X. Wu et al., 2020; Zhang and Zhang, 2018). However, there
is no review paper that has summarized commonly used pattern
recognition algorithms for e-nose and e-tongue, and compared their
performances in determining food quality. No review article has
discussed e-nose and e-tongue together. In addition, future trends, lim-
itations, and implementation guild of e-nose and e-tongue were not
discussed together in any review manuscript. In this review, the appli-
cations of e-nose and e-tongue in determining food quality were sum-
marized, and the working principles of each commonly used sensor
were discussed. The review paper also summarized the pattern recogni-
tion algorithms used for e-nose and e-tongue, introducing the working
principles and their applications. The future trends, limitations, and im-
plementation guild of e-nose and e-tongue were also discussed.
2. Electronic nose
In daily life, the human nose is a useful analytical tool to evaluate the
quality of foods before consuming and identifying potentially hazardous
gas in the environment. In many industries, the quality of drinks, food,
perfumes, cosmetic, and volatile chemical products are accessed by sen-
sory panels, which are groups of trained or untrained peoples who ﬁll
out evaluation questionnaires based on the smells of the products. It
has been reported that the human nose has around 400 scent receptors
and can detect at least one trillion odors (Bushdid et al., 2014). Although
the human nose can rate a smell, individuals' judgments may be bias,
and human nose cannot be used to sense toxic gases. In addition,
human nose has detection limits for difference gases. Those limitations
prevent the human nose from being a universal tool for all smell-related
discrimination and classiﬁcation.
An electronic nose (e-nose) is a gas sensor array that gives ﬁnger-
print response to speciﬁc volatiles, which then can be used by pattern
recognition algorithms, such as artiﬁcial neural network (ANN), to
perform discrimination and classiﬁcation. The sensing-interpreting-
discriminating process of an electronic nose is a mimic of human olfac-
tion (Fig. 1).
Typically, the volatile molecules react with the sensing materials of
the gas sensor and cause irreversible changes in electrical related prop-
erties, such as conductivity. These changes are then detected and char-
acterized by pattern recognition algorithms to perform discrimination
or classiﬁcation. Compared with traditional gas analytical equipment in-
cluding, GC–MS, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and
Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometry, e-nose is a relatively
inexpensive and less time-consuming approach. Compared with sen-
sory panels, e-noses are less biased and give more consistent measure-
ments between devices. Therefore, e-noses have broad applications in
monitoring smell related processing, including cocoa bean/tea fermen-
tation (Tan and Kerr, 2019; Yang et al., 2018), cocoa/coffee bean
roasting (Dong et al., 2019; Tan, 2017; Tan and Kerr, 2018b), and choc-
olate conching time (Tan and Kerr, 2019). E-noses can also be used to
determine the smell related quality of food, such as the varieties of vin-
egar (X. H. Wu et al., 2020), the freshness of meat (Chen et al., 2019),
meat spoilage (Kodogiannis, 2018).
2.1. Sensors of e-nose
Depending on the sensing materials, gas sensors can be classiﬁed
into several types including, conducting polymers (CP), metal-oxide-
semiconductor (MOS), quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), and surface
acoustic wave (SAW) sensors (Wilson, 2012). The target gases react
with the sensing materials, causing reversible electrical properties,
such as conductivity. The measurement of conductivity is typically ob-
tained by measuring the output voltage of the sensor and characterizes
the output voltage pattern by parameters such as voltage peak, response
time, and recovery time (Fig. 1).
2.1.1. Metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) sensors
MOS is the most widely used technology for electronic noses, and
the most common sensing materials of MOS are metal-oxides or semi-
conducting including, tin dioxides, zinc oxides, iron oxides, titanium di-
oxide, nickel oxide, cobalt oxide. The sensing materials are coated onto a
ceramic substrate, such as alumina. Typically, the device also has a
heating element (Burgués and Marco, 2018). Depending on the types
of the sensing materials (reduction or oxidization), there are two
types of gas sensors, n-type sensors (made from oxides of zinc, tin or
iron) which respond mainly to reducing compounds (e.g., H2, CH4, CO,
C2H5 or H2S), and p-type sensor (made from oxides of nickel oxides or
cobalt oxides) which respond mainly to oxidizing compounds (O2,
NO2, and Cl2) (Nazemi et al., 2019). The working principle of MOS sen-
sors is summarized in Fig. 2. The reactions occurring between sensing
materials and gases are described in Eqs. (1)–(2):

where e is an electron from the oxide, R(g) is the reducing gas, g is the
sensing materials, and s is gas. In the ﬁrst step, oxygen from the environ-
ment is incorporated in the surface semiconductors' lattice of the
105

sensor, setting its electrical resistance to a stable state. During the mea-
surement, target volatile molecules near the surface of the sensing ma-
terial react (oxidation/reduction) with the incorporated oxygen species
causing a change of the electrical properties, such as capacitance and re-
sistance of the device (Liu et al., 2012; Tan and Kerr, 2017, 2018a).
It was reported that MOS gas sensors are sensitive to hydrogen and
unsaturated hydrocarbons or solvent vapors containing hydrogen
atoms (Dey, 2018). Some food-derived volatile compounds that can be
detected by MOS sensors include alcohols, (e.g., ethanol and1-
Hexanol), organic acids (e.g., acetic acid and butyric acid), sulﬁde
(e.g., dimethyl sulﬁde), alkanes (e.g., hexane), esters (e.g., ethyl ester),
aldehyde (e.g., benzaldehyde and nonanal) and ketones (e.g., acetone,
butanone, and propyl decanoate) (Pacioni et al., 2014; Tan and Kerr,
2018b). The detection threshold of commercial MOS sensors varied be-
tween 1 ppm–1000 ppm based on the speciﬁcation provided by some
major MOS sensor producers, including Figaro, and Nemoto.
The main disadvantage of the MOS sensor array is that the devices
require to operate at temperatures between 150 and 400 °C (Nazemi
et al., 2019). Therefore, they consume a signiﬁcant amount of energy
and need a relatively long time for heating before they are ready to
take measurements.
2.1.2. Conducting polymers (CP) sensors
CP (also called intrinsically conducting polymer, ICP) composites
consist of conducting particles such as polypyrrole, polyaniline, and
polythiophene interspersed in an insulating polymer matrix (Megha
et al., 2018). According to a previous study, CP gas sensors might be
the second widely used gas sensor after MOS sensors (Dey, 2018).
When the sensing materials are exposed to chemical vapors, the reac-
tions between the sensing materials and the chemical vapors introduce
impunity into the sensing materials (doping). The doping level in CPs
transfers electrons to or from the analytes, causing a change in
conductivity (Bai and Shi, 2007). CPs have good sensitives (thresh-
old b 10 ppm) to many food-derived volatile compounds including al-
dehyde (e.g., act aldehyde), acetates, and alcohols (e.g., butanol) from
pears, ammonia from food spoilage (Matindoust et al., 2017), alcohols
from drinks (Péres et al., 2012), and alcoholic volatile organic com-
pounds (VOCs) associated with spoiled beef (Khot et al., 2011).
CP gas sensors can operate without extra heating; thus, they exhibit
a considerably lower power consumption than metal-oxide gas sensors.
In addition to that, conducting polymers are easily synthesized through
chemical or electrochemical processes. The structure of CP molecular
chains can be modiﬁed by copolymerization or structural derivations.
Furthermore, CPs have good mechanical properties, which make them
more durable and easier to be shipped (Megha et al., 2018).
The major disadvantage of CP sensor arrays is that they are suscepti-
ble to humidity and similar to MOS sensors, they also require high oper-
ating temperatures to ensure the chemical reaction between sensing
materials and the target gases (Megha et al., 2018). Therefore, it is nec-
essary to control humidity between each measurement. The vapor pres-
sure can also affect the response of the sensing ﬁlm, which requires the
ﬁlm being placed in a chamber when the environment is controlled,
such as a reaction chamber of an e-nose.
2.1.3. Acoustic wave sensors
An acoustic wave sensor typically consists of a piezoelectric sub-
strate such as (quartz crystal, ZnO, lithium niobite), coated with sensing
material (polymeric ﬁlm), and two interdigital transducers (one input
and one output) (Go et al., 2017). Voltage induced shear or compression
deformation of the piezoelectric substrate generates acoustic waves,
and the waves propagate through the substrate. Upon reaction between
compatible analyte and sensing material, the mass of the gas-sensitive
membrane of the sensor is changed, causing the change in SAW velocity
and attenuation. The effect of mass change (Δm) on the SAW along with
Fig. 1. Sensing-interpreting-discriminating process of an electronic nose.
106

other factors including the change of mechanical (Pmec) factors
(e.g., viscosity and elasticity), electric (Pele) factors (e.g., conductivity
and permittivity), and environmental (Penv) factors (e.g., temperature
and humidity). is given by Eq. (3):

where γ is the complex propagation coefﬁcient of the propagating wave
and k0 is the wave number in unperturbed state (Devkota et al., 2017).
There are two types of acoustic wave gas sensors, bulk acoustic wave
transducers (BAW) sensor, and surface acoustic wave transducers
(SAW) sensor (Go et al., 2017). The acoustic wave propagates on the
surface of the substrate is called SAW, while the wave propagates
through the substrate is called BAW. The schematic diagram of a SAW
gas sensor and a BAW gas sensor (quartz crystal microbalance (QCM)
gas sensor) were shown in Fig. 2a and b, respectively. Both types of sen-
sors exhibit frequency shifts related to absorbed analytes by their sens-
ing materials.
SAW gas sensors had been used for the rapid detection of food path-
ogens and spoilages (Kordas et al., 2016; Lamanna et al., 2020; Xu and
Yuan, 2019). The volatiles from olive oils, vegetable oil, and coconut
oil, including organic acids (e.g., acetic acid, propanoic acid, pentanoic
acid, and hexanoic acid), ethyl acetate, and hexanal were quantiﬁed
by using SAW gas sensor coupling with Solid Phase Microextraction
(SPME) (Marina et al., 2010). Similar to SAW sensors, BAW gas sensors
also have broad applications in determining food volatiles. QCM sensors
were used to detect tea aroma (e.g., linalool, geraniol, linalool oxide,
Methyl salicylate, and Trans-2-hexenal) from the process of black tea
fermentation (Sharma et al., 2015). The sensor was also used to deter-
mine the freshness of Chinese Quince and kiwifruits (Yen and Yao,
2018; Zheng et al., 2016).
Although both QCM and SW have good precision, high sensitivity,
and diverse target gases, there are still some limitations to the sensors.
For example, QCM sensors have complex circuitry, poor signal-to-
noise ratio, and can be inﬂuenced by humidity (Länge, 2019).
2.2. Electronic nose system
The physical part of a typical e-nose system that consists of gas sen-
sor arrays, reaction chamber, valves, air pumps for sampling and
cleaning, control devices, and data acquisition (DAQ) devices (Tan
et al., 2019). One example of a typical e-nose system is shown in Fig. 3.
The design of an e-nose system can be varied depending on the pur-
pose of the application. A commercial e-nose is typically handy and
compact. However, there is no commercial e-nose that can test all
food volatiles. Therefore, some researchers customized their e-nose to
obtain unique functions for different samples. In a previous study, the
volatile compounds of cocoa beans were captured by placing heated
cocoa beans in a syringe and injected into the reaction chamber by a sy-
ringe pump (Tan and Kerr, 2018b). In another e-nose design, a sensor
array was placed directly at the headspace of the sample instead of in
a reaction chamber (Tan and Kerr, 2019). Multiple reaction chambers
were used in an e-nose system to achieve mobile sensing (Arroyo
et al., 2020; Fan et al., 2019).
2.3. Pattern recognition algorithms and classiﬁcation methods for e-
nose data
Signals obtained by an e-nose system combined with pattern-
recognition algorithms or pattern classiﬁers such as Principal Compo-
nent Analysis (PCA), support vector machines (SVM), artiﬁcial neural
networks (ANN), random forest (RF), and other machine learning clas-
siﬁers enable the recognition of different sample types via aggregation

107

of similar emissions into clusters representing compounds from related
food volatiles.
2.3.1. PCA
PCA is a widely used basic classiﬁcation technique, which had been
successfully used gas sensor applications. It is a linear and unsupervised
pattern-recognition method. Data collected by e-noses are typically in
high-dimensional space due to the relatively high number of employed
gas sensors and multiple extracted signal characters. PCA reduces the
dimension of high-dimensional data to lower-dimensional space
(Hong et al., 2018).
The signals data obtained from an e-nose is represented by an M by
N matrix, A. The goal of PCA is to project A to x (x b N) linearly uncorre-
lated (orthogonal) vectors, PC1, PC2, …, PCx, also known as principal
components with maximum variance, in another word, data is most
spread out when projected onto it. Statistically, the principal compo-
nents are the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of A (Ripley,
2014). After PCs were selected, the signals data are projected to the
PCs, and classiﬁcation or pattern recognition are conducted based on se-
lected criteria, such as the Euclidean space between each data set.
2.3.2. SVM
SVM is another widely used classiﬁcation and pattern recognition
technology based on statistical learning theory (SLT). Its applications
were reported in previous studies, including face identiﬁcation, chemi-
cal classiﬁcation, text categorization, bioinformatics, data mining
(Chauhan et al., 2019). The SVM approach places the original data points
from their input space into a higher dimensional feature space using a
kernel function. The commonly employed kernel functions include lin-
ear, nonlinear, polynomial, Gaussian kernel, Radial basis function
(RBF), and sigmoid (Papadopoulou et al., 2013). Based on that, the
working principle of SVM is to separate the data with known categories
or groups with a particular hyperplane, which maximizes the distance
from a hyperplane to the nearest point in the separated dataset or max-
imize the margin. The search for the hyperplane is typically achieved by
solving objective function (margin) with inequality constraints, using
the Lagrange multiplier method and applying Karush-Kuhn-Tucker
(KKT) conditions (necessary and sufﬁcient for the solution) (Keﬁ-
Fatteh et al., 2019). In this step, the SVM is trained. Once the hyperplane
is determined, in this next step, unclassiﬁed data were projected to the
realm of SVM and classiﬁed based on their location to the hyperplane.
SVM had been intensively reported to classify food materials based
on e-nose signals. The microbiological quality and freshness of beef ﬁllet
(Kodogiannis, 2017; Mohareb et al., 2016) were determined by using
SVM-electronic nose methods. Strawberry juice processed microwave
pasteurization, steam blanching, high-temperature short-time pasteur-
ization, frozen-thawed, and freshly squeezed were discriminated by
SVM-electronic nose (Qiu et al., 2014). In one other study, food addi-
tives, including benzoic acid and chitosan were detected by e-nose
using the SVM classiﬁer (Qiu and Wang, 2017). The ripeness of banana
(Sanaeifar et al., 2014), olfactory information of beer (Shi et al., 2019),
variety and geographical origin of apples (Wu et al., 2018), and detec-
tion of moldy apple (Jia et al., 2019), were also reported can be deter-
mined through SVM-electronic nose approach. In the mentioned
studies, the performance of SVM was also compared with other classi-
ﬁers including, PCA, extreme learning machine (ELM), linear discrimi-
nant analysis (LDA), partial least squares regression (PLS), and RF.
2.3.3. ANN
ANN is a powerful machine learning-based classiﬁer, which has non-
linear mapping capability. Various types of ANN, such as multi-layer
perceptron (MLP), learning vector quantization (LVQ), and Kohonen
networks,
have
been
employed
for
e-nose data
classiﬁcation
(Sanaeifar et al., 2017). An ANN classiﬁer consists of interconnected
layers of artiﬁcial neurons, and it is trained to perform a classiﬁcation
by adjusting the weight and biases of the connections between the neu-
rons. The structure of the neuron pattern, the learning process, and the
activation function of the neurons determine the functions of an ANN. A
schematic of an ANN is shown in Fig. 4a.
In the training step of an ANN, input, and corresponding target (out-
put) pairs are required. The weights of the connections are adjusted
based on a comparison of the output and the target. The training will
be continuously repeated until the network outputs match a termina-
tion criteria (Kumar et al., 2015). Typically transfer functions for train-
ing ANNs include the sigmoid function, step function, linear
combination, and the rectiﬁer. The performance of an ANN depends
on many factors, such as the number of training pairs, the structure of
the ANN, the selection of a transfer function and activation function,
and training termination criteria.
In earlier studies on ANN-electronic nose, ANNs trained by
backpropagation errors were often used to determine the beer quality
(Gonzalez Viejo et al., 2020), the sensory attributes of foods (Zhong,
2019), aging of rice (Rahimzadeh et al., 2019), types of French cheese
(Ghasemi-Varnamkhasti et al., 2019), and the presence of foodborne
pathogens in foods (Bonah et al., 2019). In more recent studies, diversi-
ﬁed training methods were employed, and multiple classiﬁers were

108

combined with ANN to process data obtained by e-noses. Quadratic
polynomial step regression (QPSR) and multiple linear regression
(MLR) were used to determine the ﬁrmness of fruits based on e-nose
data as a comparison of using backpropagation ANN (Zhang et al.,
2008). ANN, combined with PCA, was used to determine the freshness
of chicken meat (Timsorn et al., 2014) and the roasting degree of
cocoa beans (Tan and Kerr, 2018b). PCA reduces the dimension of the
data before an ANN was trained, which signiﬁcantly decreases the num-
ber of inputs (Ordukaya and Karlik, 2017). In another study, a
probabilistic neural network (PNN) was trained to classify the quality
of Orange, Lemon, Sweet Lime, and Tomato (Narendra and Govardhan
Hegde, 2019). The general regression neural network (GRNN) is an-
other type of ANN that had been used to determine food authenticity
based on e-nose (Peris and Escuder-Gilabert, 2016).
2.3.4. Convolutional neural network (CNN)
CNN is a type of deep learning neural network that has been widely
used for image recognition. Brieﬂy, the image data (e.g., intensity and
RGB value) is passed through a series of convolutional layer contains ﬁl-
ters (or neuron, or core), pooling layers, and fully connected layers, and
then generates the output. A schematic diagram of a basic form of CNN
architecture is shown in Fig. 4b. In short, the ﬁlters carry out
convolutional operations to the input data and extract the high-level
features such as edges, from the input image. Then the pooling layers
continuously reduce the image size and the computation in the network
by approaches such as max pooling and average pooling. After input
data going through the above processes, the data are feed to regular
ANN (fully connected layers) for classiﬁcation (Phung and Rhee,
2019). In a previous review paper, CNN was identiﬁed as a good tool
for recognizing foods, estimating food calorie, and detecting fruit, vege-
table, and meat quality (Zhou et al., 2019).
2.3.5. Decision tree and RF
A decision tree is a tree structure classiﬁer consists of layers of inter-
nal and external nodes connected by branches. Each internal node has a
selected decision function, which determines which node to be trans-
ferred to (Cho and Kurup, 2011). External nodes indicate the output cor-
responding to an input vector.
The ID3 (by Quinlan) algorithm is the most used training algorithm
for a decision tree. The ID3 algorithm builds the decision tree using a
top-to-bottom and greedy approach. In the ﬁrst step, it selects one attri-
bute, N, as the ﬁrst node. N has the most information gain, which

109

indicates how well the attribute classiﬁes the data. In the next step, it
creates a new descendant of the node for each N. After that, ID3 sorts
the training samples to the appropriate descendant node leaf. If all the
training samples were successfully classiﬁed, then iteration is termi-
nated. Otherwise, the iteration continues until other termination
criteria met.
A RF is a collection of multiple trained decision trees, and when a
sample is to be classiﬁed, each decision tree will “vote” for the class
of the sample. The sample is then assigned based on the majority
vote (Schroeder et al., 2019). Due to the relatively large number of
decision trees, the attributes for training the decision trees can be
randomly selected from all the attributes without necessarily choos-
ing the one with most information gain. The training of a RF can be
achieved by many different approaches. For example, m random
samples are selected from the training sample pool with replace-
ment to train the decision trees (bootstrap RF). Alternatively, train-
ing can be conducted by maintaining a set of weights over the
original training set S and adjusts these weights based on successful
classiﬁcation. The weights of examples that are misclassiﬁed are in-
creased, and the weights of examples that are correctly classiﬁed
are reduced (Elith et al., 2008).
2.3.6. Selection of classiﬁer algorithms
The selection of a classiﬁer depends mainly on the type of dataset
(continuous, categorical, or binary), the number of the features of each
dataset, number of the dataset, and supervised or unsupervised learn-
ing. For most of the cases, supervised machine learning classiﬁers
were employed. Unsupervised training is typically designed to discover
unknown, but useful, classes of items (Kotsiantis, 2007). In many cases,
hybrid approaches such as PCA coupled with ANN, was used because
the number of features is relatively big. In Table 1, the performance of
some typical classiﬁer algorithms was summarized based on a previous
review paper (Kotsiantis, 2007):
2.4. Limitations and future trends of e-noses in determining food qualities
It is well-known that sample preparation and sampling are error-
prone steps for e-nose measurements. Gas sensors are very sensitive
to temperature, humidity, pressure, gas velocity, and vapor concen-
tration. Sample preparation of e-nose sensing is also very challeng-
ing since the amount of volatiles released from foods depends on
many factors such as temperature, pressure, and humidity. High re-
peatability and precision of e-nose measurement require strict con-
trol of sample preparation and sampling environment (Kiselev
et al., 2018). Therefore, it is difﬁcult to use e-noses in an open ﬁeld
or mobile sensing. A great number of sample size (typically N10)
for each type of sample is often required for training and validation.
In some cases, the sample size needs to be even greater. Some types
of gas sensors, such as MOS sensors, required heating to reach an
equilibrium state before measuring, which is both time and energy
consuming. Also, high energy demands also limit the portability of
the e-noses. Unlike the human nose where hundreds of scent recep-
tors reside, one e-nose typically employs a few numbers of sensors
(less than 20); thus, their capability to discriminate different
aroma is hampered. Techniques, such as ANN and PCA, employed
to process e-nose data were developed for classifying static features.
Therefore, only time-invariant information from the e-nose can be
used. Comparing e-nose measurements from literature is another
challenge. The difference in sensor array selection, sampling prepa-
ration, sampling approach, pattern recognition algorithm, and train-
ing data pool resulted in incomparable published works.
One direction for future e-nose development is to minimize sample
handling procedures and reduce the inﬂuences of the sampling environ-
ment. This requires the development of new sensing materials that are
insensitive to environment variation while having high speciﬁcation to
some volatiles. E-nose will also employ nano gas sensors so that the
number of gas sensors employed by an e-nose will be close to the num-
ber of scene receptors in the human nose. This will expand the capabil-
ity of e-nose to differentiate different aroma. Another trend for e-nose is
the employment of big data and artiﬁcial intelligence. For example, the
development of a shared online library where data obtained from users
all over the world using standardized e-noses can be used by other users
to train their e-nose. In summary, e-noses will have more universal ap-
plications, smaller size, more user-friendly, and invariant to measuring
the environment.
3. Electronic tongue
The human sense of taste consists of ﬁve basic tastes, including
sweetness, sourness, bitterness, saltiness, and umami. Human sensory
panel (trained or untrained) has been employed to conduct taste evalu-
ations on many food products (Jiang et al., 2018). However, running and
training a sensory panel is relatively time-consuming and expensive. In
some cases, sensory panels may introduce biases if the panelists were
not well-trained. Therefore, e-tongue, a rapid-sensing, unbiased, and in-
expensive alternative for the human tongue were employed by many
researchers (Schlossareck and Ross, 2019).
3.1. Taste sensors
The chemical sensors commonly employed for an e-tongue include
electrochemical sensors, biosensors, and optical mass sensors (Jiang
et al., 2018). Similar to gas sensors of e-nose, the chemical sensors
employed by e-tongue react with analytes, creating reversible changes
of electrical properties. Measurable electrical signals are then being
used to do pattern recognition and classiﬁcation.
3.1.1. Potentiometric chemical sensors
Potentiometric chemical sensors are the most commonly used sen-
sors for e-tongue. Potentiometric sensors measure the voltage differ-
ence between the working electrodes and the reference electrode. The
reference electrode is submerged in an electrolyte solution, and the
voltage of the reference sensor is constant. The voltage of the working
electrode, on the other hand, depends on the concentration of the ana-
lyte in the solution phase (Winquist et al., 2002). The potential of the
electrode (E) as a function of the concentration of ratio of the oxidized
(Co) to the reduced form (Cr) of the analyte can be expressed by Nernst
equation:
E ¼ Eo þ

where Eo (V) is the potential of the electrode at standard conditions, T
(°C) is the temperature. One example of a two-electrode potentiometric
chemical sensor was shown in Fig. 5a. The electrode has an ion-selective

membrane, which allows the uptake of only one speciﬁc ion. Some po-
tentiometric chemical sensors have three electrodes, and in some cases,
membranes were not used.
Commonly used membranes for potentiometric chemical sensors
are glass membrane, crystalline/solid-state membrane, liquid mem-
brane, and polymer membrane (e.g., polyvinylchloride) (Moreno
et al., 2018). Glass membrane electrodes are made from silicate
glass, which is typically used for the determination of H+ or pH
and Na+. Crystalline/solid-state membrane is composed of inorganic
salts, such as AgCl, Ag2S, and LaF3. Crystalline/solid-state membrane
sensors are used to determine Cl− and F−. A liquid membrane is
made by dissolving one ion-exchanger or ionophore in a viscous or-
ganic membrane. Liquid membrane electrodes are widely used for
determining Ca2+. A polymer membrane is typically composed of
PVC, plasticizers, and the ion carrier or exchanger. Polymer mem-
brane electrodes have been used to determine ions such as K+, Ca2
+, Cl− and NO3− (Ding et al., 2017).
Potentiometric electronic tongues have been used for classifying
olive oils obtained from single olive cultivars (Dias et al., 2014), differen-
tiating honey produced from different states in the United States
(Escriche et al., 2012), discriminating different commercial beers and
wines (Nery and Kubota, 2016), and quantifying sugar content in solu-
tions (Arca et al., 2019). Those studies have shown good accuracies,
comparing to standard analytical methods.
The main advantage of using potentiometric sensors is they can se-
lect many different, both speciﬁc and less speciﬁc, membranes for its
electrodes. Therefore, potentiometric sensors can measure a very
broad range of chemical compounds in solutions (Winquist, 2008).
One of the main disadvantages of potentiometric sensors is that they
are sensitive to temperature. The membrane may adsorb the solution
components, which can affect the nature of the charge transfer. There-
fore, the temperature needs to be controlled, and the electrodes need
to be washed by solvents to minimize the effect (Ciosek and
Wróblewski, 2011).
3.1.2. Voltammetric chemical sensors
Similar to potentiometric sensors, a voltammetric sensor consists of
one working electrode and one reference electrode. Upon measuring, a
potential (voltage) is applied to the working electrode and the resulting
current generated due to the reduction and oxidization of the analytes
(Winquist, 2008). The value of the current is related to the concentra-
tion of the target analytes. The relation between E and resulting current
(I) follows:
I ¼ Ee
−
t
ðBRs
Þ
�
�
RS
ð5Þ
where RS is the resistance of the analyte solution, t is the time elapsed
after the onset of a voltage pulse, and B is an electrode related equiva-
lent capacitance constant. Typically, pulse voltammetry is used for
voltammetric e-tongue. The most widely used pulse voltammetry are
large amplitude pulse voltammetry (LAPV) and small amplitude pulse
voltammetry (SAPV). In some cases, staircase voltammetry has also
been used (Alcañiz et al., 2012).
In previous studies, voltammetric e-tongues were used to detect
the percentages of adulteration of argan oil with sunﬂower oil
(Bougrini et al., 2014), monitor the quality and storage time of un-
sealed pasteurized milk (Wei et al., 2013), discriminate honey sam-
ples based on their ﬂoral types (Tiwari et al., 2013), and conduct a
quantitative analysis of quality parameters in spring water (Carbó
et al., 2018).
3.1.3. Bioelectric sensors
Bioelectric sensors are electronic sensors employing biomaterials as
their sensing materials. Biological materials, including enzymes, whole
cells, tissues, receptors, or antibodies, were widely used to construct
sensors, such as voltammetric sensors, impedimetric sensors, potentio-
metric sensors, and conductometric sensors, for the application of e-
tongue. The working principle of a sensor typically involves a series of
biochemical reactions, such as enzyme-substrate reaction, leading to
the transport of electrons, ions, or molecules. The working principle of
bioelectric sensors was summarized in a schematic diagram shown in
Fig. 5b.
Sweeteners and acids are important ingredients for foods, which

The
voltammetric bioelectric sensors are typically employed to deter-
mine sweeteners such as glucose, lactate, sucrose, or acids such as
lactic acid, acetic acid, and sialic acid. In previous studies, glucose
was determined based on glucose oxidase, which consumed oxygen
and produced hydrogen peroxide. The quantity of the hydrogen

peroxide was then determined by voltammetric bioelectric sensors
(Hong Wu et al., 2009). The reactions can be summarized as

nase (FDH) using an electron acceptor serving as an electrochemical
mediator (Monosik et al., 2012):

Sucrose and galactose were determined by quantifying the glucose
obtained from the enzymatic hydrolysis of sucrose and galactose. The
enzymes used to hydrolyze sucrose and galactose were invertase and
galactosidase, respectively. Similar working principles were also
employed to enzymatically determine citric acid, lactic acid, malic
acid, ascorbic acid, and acetic acid (Monosik et al., 2012).
An impedimetric biosensor typically includes two to three elec-
trodes with applied sinusoidal voltage. It measures the change of im-
pedance (Z) due to the result of the analyte binding to the electrodes:
Z2 ¼ R2 þ XC
2
ð9Þ
where R and XC is the components resistance and the capacitive reac-
tance, respectively. The biomaterials commonly used to immobilize
analytes on the surface of the electrode include antibodies, nucleic acids,
bacteriophages, and lectins. Therefore, impedimetric biosensors were
generally classiﬁed into four categories, including antibody-based sen-
sors, nucleic acid-based sensors, bacteriophage-based sensors, and
lectin-based sensors.
Impedimetric biosensors had been used to determine herbicide and
pesticide residues in food (Malvano et al., 2017) and detect food toxins
(Solanki et al., 2010; Srivastava et al., 2014). Impedimetric biosensors
are also widely used to detect microbial growth through direct binding
of the target bacteria or immobilizing the conductive metabolites of the
target microorganisms (Rengaraj et al., 2018). In previous studies, food
pathogens, including E. coli O157: H7 (Lin et al., 2019), Salmonella
Typhimurium (Sheikhzadeh et al., 2016), Staphylococcus aureus, and Ba-
cillus cereus (Reich et al., 2017).
3.2. Electronic tongue system
A typical e-tongue system consists of a chemical sensor array, a reac-
tion vessel, measuring devices, transducers, and data acquisition de-
vices, and data processing and pattern recognition algorithms (Fig. 6).
The functions of an e-tongue system can be changed by using different
types of sensors, different data processing strategies, and pattern recog-
nition algorithms.
3.3. Pattern recognition algorithms and classiﬁcation methods for e-
tongue data
Electronic tongue signals are typically processed by the same classi-
ﬁers, including RF, PCA, PLS, ANN, and SVM, to conduct pattern recogni-
tion. In Table 2, some examples of the classiﬁers used for e-tongue
within ten years are summarized.
3.4. Limitations and future trends of e-tongues
A sensor employed by an e-tongue presents a speciﬁc response to-
ward the target analyte. However, most of the chemical sensors
employed by e-tongue encountering signiﬁcant matrix effects when
dealing with real food samples (Cetó et al., 2016). Therefore, a sample
pre-treatment step is typically added so that the sensors are designed
to work toward speciﬁc analytes in certain types of samples. This pre-
treatment step is time-consuming when multiple analytes are analyzed
at a time. Another limitation of e-tongue is the relatively short lifetime
of the sensing materials, especially biomaterials, of the sensors. It re-
quires the users to frequently examine the performances of the e-
tongue. In addition, a great number of sample size (typically N10) for
each type of sample is often required for training and validation. In
some cases, the sample size needs to be even greater.
One trend of e-tongue is the employment of biosensors with high se-
lectivity and speciﬁcity, which reduces the impact of a complex and
interferents. More biomaterials, including nucleic acids and aptamers,
antibodies, cells, phages, and, namely, enzymes, will be used as recogni-
tion elements for those sensors. The development of standardized uni-
versal functions e-tongues will be very useful for food processors to
determine the quality of their products. Similar to e-nose, the develop-
ment of a shared online library where store pattern classiﬁers trained by
data obtained from standardized e-tongue. This can signiﬁcantly

4. Conclusion
This review summarized the applications of e-nose and e-tongue in
determining the quality-related properties of foods. The working princi-
ples of various sensors were introduced, and electronic devices
employed those sensors, including e-noses and e-tongues were also
discussed in this review. The working principles of commonly used pat-
tern recognition algorithms and classiﬁcation methods, such as ANN,
CNN, PCA, PLS, and SVM were introduced and discussed. Overall, e-
nose and e-tongue combing pattern recognition algorithms are very
powerful analytical tools, which are relatively low-cost, rapid, and accu-
rate. E-nose and e-tongue are also suitable for both in-line and off-line
measurements, which are very useful in monitoring food processing
and detecting the end product quality. The user of e-nose and e-
tongue need to strictly control sample preparation, sampling, and data
processing. Relatively poor repeatability and comparability of e-nose
and e-tongue measurement and data processing are still two challenges
that need to be proper addressed. For e-nose and e-tongue approaches,
great number of sample size (typically N10) for each type of sample is
often required for training and validation. In some cases, the sample
size needs to be even greater. Online shared library for training data
pool, standardized device with multiple functions, mobile sensing, and
smartphone interface will boost the power of e-nose and e-tongue in
the future.
