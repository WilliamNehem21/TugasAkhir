The critical slip distance in rate and state model for fault friction in the study of potential earthquakes can vary
wildly from micrometers to few me-ters depending on the length scale of the critically stressed fault. This
makes it incredibly important to construct an inversion framework that provides good estimates of the critical
slip distance purely based on the observed ac-celeration at the seismogram. To eventually construct a frame-
work that takes noisy seismogram acceleration data as input and spits out robust estimates of critical slip
distance as the output, we ﬁrst present the performance of the framework for synthetic data. The framework is
based on Bayesian inference and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. The synthetic data is generated by
adding noise to the acceleration output of spring-slider-damper idealization of the rate and state model as the
forward model.
1. Introduction
Inversion of seismogram data to infer subsurface properties is one of
the most critical aspects of geophysics research. In a nutshell, the ac-
tivity at and around discontinuities called faults in the subsurface
spawn off seismic waves which are recorded at the surface on a seis-
mogram. Some of these recordings are too weak to enable any inference
of subsurface properties, while some are too rich in terms in seismic
signatures. The ﬁeld of waveform inversion deals with the aspects of
inference for the latter. The core set of mathematical operations for
waveform inversion are going back and forth between the time domain
and the frequency domain. To the naked eye, these operations and al-
gorithms to implement them can get a little complicated to the com-
munity of researchers who do not have a ﬁrm background in inversion
geophysics. Over the past few years, Bayesian methods to infer prop-
erties from seismogram data have become popular because of the
advent of high performance computing and the ability to construct
reduced order models of the high ﬁdelity physics using deep learning.
At the heart of the Bayesian inversion framework lies the feasibility to
perform a lot of fast forward simulations to eventually arrive at robust
estimates of the model parameter. Before stepping into any inversion
framework, two questions are critical (1) What is the forward model?
and (2) What are we infering? In the geophysics realm, the connection
between the physics of what happens around the fault and what hap-
pens at the fault is achieved using the rate- and state- model for friction
evolution, which is considered the gold standard for modeling earth-
quake cycles on faults (Ruina, 1983; Scholz, 1989; Marone, 1998; Meng
and Shi, 2021; Jia et al., 2021; Zhu et al., 2020)

where V ¼ j_dj is the slip rate magnitude, a ¼ _V which we hypothesize
is of the same order as recorded by seismograph, μ0 is the steady-state
friction coefﬁcient at the reference slip rate V0, A and B are empirical
dimensionless constants, θ is the macroscopic variable characterizing
state of the surface and dc is a critical slip distance over which a fault
loses or regains its frictional strength after a perturbation in the
loading conditions (Palmer and Rice, 1591). In principle, it determines
the maximum slip acceleration and radiated energy to such an extent
that it inﬂuences the magnitude and time scale of the associated stress
breakdown process (Scholz, 2019). Regardless of the importance, it is
paradoxical that the values of dc reported in the literature range from a
few to tens of microns as determined in typical laboratory experiments

mological estimates based on geophysical observations (Kaneko et al.,
2017), and further to several meters as determined in high velocity
laboratory experiments (Niemeijer et al., 2011). Understanding the
physics that controls the critical slip distance and explains the gap
between observations from experimental and natural faults is thus one
of the crucial problems in both the seismology and laboratory com-
munities (Ohnaka, 2003). With that in mind, we provide a framework
in which synthetic earthquake data is used to quantify uncertainty in
critical slip distance. While the resolution and coupled ﬂow and
poromechanics (Dana and Wheeler, 2018a; Dana and Wheeler, 2018b;
Dana et al., 2018; Dana et al., 2021; DanaJoel Ita and Wheeler, 2020;
Dana et al., 2020; Dana, 2018; Dana and Reddy, 2021; Dana and
Reddy Lyathakula, 2021) associated with subsurface activity in the
realm of energy technologies and concomitant earthquake quantiﬁ-
cation is a hot topic, in this work, we focus on the effect of a standard
trigonometric perturbation with exponentially decreasing amplitude.
In section 2, we explain the spring slider damper idealization to infer
the inﬂuence of critical slip distance on RSF without recourse to
complicated elastodynamic equations. In section 3, we explain the
Bayesian inference framework to inversely quantify uncertainty in the
estimation of critical slip distance. In section 4, we present the results
from our investigation. In section 5, we present conclusions and
outlook for future work.

As shown in Fig. 1, we model a fault by a slider spring system (Rice
and Gu, 1983; Gu et al., 1984; Dieterich, 1992). The friction coefﬁcient of
the block is given by
μ ¼ τ
σ ¼ τl � kδ � ηV
σ
(3)
where σ is the normal stress, τ the shear stress on the interface, τl is the
remotely applied stress acting on the fault in the absence of slip, -kδ is the
stress relaxation due to fault slip and η is the radiation damping coefﬁ-
cient (Kanamori and E Brodsky, 2004; McClure and Horne, 2011). We
consider the case of a constant stressing rate _τl ¼ kVl where Vl is the load
point velocity. The stiffness is a function of the fault length l and elastic
modulus E as k � E

stiffness and damping are obtained as k0 � 10�2(μm)�1 and k00 ¼ 10�7 s/

point perturbation of the form

is shown in Fig. 2. Before feeding the data to the Bayesian inference
framework, we add synthetic noise to the data, because we would al-
ways expect some noise to come with the data in a real scenario, and we
would want to test the robustness of the inference framework to provide
good estimates in such a realistic scenario. The reason for choosing Vl to
be varying in time as a sinusoid with an exponentially decreasing
magnitude to best replicate the quality of the seismogram velocity
reading in V.
3. The formalism of Bayesian inference with Markov chain
Monte Carlo sampling
The Bayesian inference framework works on the basic tent of
uncovering a distribution centered around the true value and starts off
with an initial guess for the distribution also called “prior” D to
eventually get to the most accurate distribution possible also called
“posterior” P through a likelihood L. The Bayes theorem in a nutshell
is:
P ¼ D � L
R
D � L
(7)
The prior is typically taken to be a Gaussian distribution and the
likelihood carries information about the forward model. The quantity
that makes evaluation of the posterior difﬁcult is the integral term in
the denominator. Since direct evaluation of the integral using quad-
rature rules is expensive, sampling methods like Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) (Shapiro, 2003; Keith Hastings, 1970; Haario et al.,
2001; Mueller, 2010) are used. To put it mathematically, if we were
evaluating an integral, then the sampling would apply to points at
which we know the value of integrand, and then proceed to evaluate
the integral. But if the integrand at each of those points is a distri-
bution rather than a value, it makes the sampling and subsequent
averaging signiﬁcantly more complicated. By constructing a Markov
chain that has the desired distribution as its equilibrium distribution,

one can obtain a sample of the desired distribution by recording states
from the chain. The more steps are included, the more closely the
distribution of the sample matches the actual desired distribution.
3.1. Applied to our problem
In this particular inverse problem, the acceleration response of the
model is known and the goal is to ﬁnd the critical slip distance parameter
dc. To formalize the problem, consider the relationship between accel-
eration a(t) and the model response by the following statistical model
aðtÞ ¼ f ðt; θ; μ; A; B; dcÞ þ ε
(8)
where ε is the noise. Assuming the ε ~ N(0, σ2) as unbiased, independent
and identical normal distribution with standard deviation σ allows us to
conveniently generate the synthetic data as shown in Fig. 2. The goal of
the inverse problem is to determine the model parameter distribution as
follows
πðdcjaðt1Þ; …; aðtnÞÞ ¼
πðaðt1Þ; …; aðtnÞjdcÞπ0ðdcÞ
R
dcπðaðt1Þ; …; aðtnÞjdcÞπ0ðdcÞddc

where π0(dc) is the prior distribution and π(a(t1), …, a(tn)|dc) is the
likelihood given by

3.2. Adaptive metropolis algorithm
The adaptive Metropolis algorithm (Haario et al., 2001) explores the
parameter space with speciﬁed limits ranging from a high of du
c to a low
of dl
c and starts from a random initial guess of the model parameter dm
c ,
where m is the iteration number. The initial covariance matrix in the
adaptive Metropolis algorithm is constructed using the initial parameter

dm¼0
c
. At each iteration, the steps are
● A random parameter sample d*
c is generated from the proposal
distribution
● If d*
c is not within the speciﬁed limits, d*
c 62 ðdl
c; du
cÞ, the iteration is
passed without moving to the next steps, and the previous sample is
considered as the new sample, dmþ1
c

c
● If d*
c is within the speciﬁed limits, d*
c 2 ðdl
c; du
cÞ, a new value of stan-
dard deviation associated with d*
c is generated using the inverse-
gamma distribution
● d*
c is accepted as the new sample dmþ1
c
¼ d*
c if a criterion which in-
volves the standard devation is met
● The covariance matrix is updated if the iteration number is an exact
multiple of m0 using the previous m0 model parameters (Smith, 2013)
The simulation is repeated for n iterations and the parameter samples
resulting from all these iterations represent the parameter posterior
distribution. The construction of the d*
c is only based on the current
parameter, dm
c , which is the Markov process. The computational time of
the MCMC sampling method is proportional to the number of generated
samples n. To put it more succinctly, the algorithm is elucidated in Al-
gorithm 1.
4. Results
Figs. 3 and 4 show a gradual improvement in the estimated model
parameter as the number of samples is increased. It is evident that the
framework has a lot more difﬁculty converging to the true value if the
initial guess is far away from the true value. In reality, it is not really
known what the true value is, and arbitrary initial guesses will lend a
solution that is way off target regardless of the number of sampling
points. We observe from Fig. 3 that the response is not necessarily
monotonic, in the sense that the estimated value with the maximum
probability does not necessarily monotonically converge to the true value
as the number of sampling points is increased. In all of the simulations,
we observe in all the simulations that the Bayesian framework does an
excellent job of dropping to the ballpark of the expected true value within
the ﬁrst few samples.
4.1. With burn-in
As an MCMC algorithm is rarely initialized from its invariant distri-
bution, there might be some concern that its initial values might bias
results even if it does approach this equilibrium distribution later on. To
compensate for this, a burn-in period is often implemented: the ﬁrst N
samples being discarded, with N being chosen to be large enough that the
chain has reached its stationary regime by this time. We take that burn-in

175
number to be half the number of samples. A comparison between Figs. 3
and 5 as well as Figs. 4 and 6 clearly demonstrates the improved accuracy
of the estimate when a certain number of samples are burnt-in.
5. Conclusions and outlook
The rate and state model for fault friction evolution is a piece of the
puzzle in which forward simulations are used to arrive at the seismic
impact of fault slip on earthquake activity. Typically, the earthquakes are
measured with seismograms and geophones on the surface as P-waves
and S-waves, and then these readings are used to calibrate the seismic
activity for constant monitoring. The acceleration ﬁeld around the fault
slip activity translates to these waves recorded on the surface, and for-
ward simulations with wave propagation bridge that gap. That being
said, a seismic recording on the surface cannot easily be backtraced to
acceleration around the fault, and ﬁnally to the source of the fault slip.
That is precisely inverse modeling, and the Bayesian framework coupled
with MCMC allows us to put such a framework in place. The accelerations
are ﬁeld quantities, and the inverse estimation of the ﬁeld around the
fault from the time series at the seismogram and/or geophone is not a
trivial task. With that in mind, we test the robustness of the Bayesian/
MCMC framework to inversely estimate a value instead of a ﬁeld. The
thing is that any inversion framework works on data as the input, and
since subsurface data is not available other the sensors at the wells, the
forward simulations are used to generate this data with all the compu-
tational physics put in place. This generated data is then used to inversely
estimate the acceleration ﬁeld from the data at the surface. Although
such forward simulations to generate data are infeasible in real-time
scenarios where we need estimates of what is happening in the subsur-
face from the reading on the surface almost immediately, the framework
robustness would eventually lend itself to that scenario. The scenario is
that the recording at the seismogram and/or geophone would be fed into
the Bayesian/MCMC fraemwork as an input, and the framework would
provide an estimate of the acceleration ﬁeld around the fault as the
output. In this work, we work on arriving at estimates of critical slip
distance in the rate and state model by running a spring-slider-damper as
the forward model instead of using a full-ﬂedged forward simulator. In
the future, we will be deploying the coupled ﬂow and geomechanics
simulator as the forward model, and gradually arrive at the aforemen-
tioned scenario.
