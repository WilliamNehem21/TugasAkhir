Natural products 
a b s t r a c t 
Natural products are attractive for drug discovery applications because of their distinctive chemical structures, 
such as an overall large fraction of sp 3 carbon atoms, chiral centers (both features associated with structural 
complexity), large chemical scaﬀolds, and diversity of functional groups. Furthermore, natural products are used 
in de novo design and have inspired the development of pseudo-natural products using generative models. Public 
databases such as the Collection of Open NatUral ProdUcTs and the Universal Natural Product database (UNPD) 
are rich sources of structures to be used in generative models and other applications. In this work, we report 
the selection and characterization of the most diverse compounds of natural products from the UNPD using 
the MaxMin algorithm. The subsets generated with 14,994, 7,497, and 4,998 compounds are publicly available 
at https://github.com/DIFACQUIM/Natural- products- subsets- generation . We anticipate that the subsets will be 
particularly useful in building generative models based on natural products by research groups, particularly those 
with limited access to extensive supercomputer resources. 
1. Introduction 
Natural products and fragments derived from natural products have 
been attractive in drug design and development because of their distinc- 
tive chemical structures. For example, natural products have, in general, 
an overall larger diversity of functional groups and larger structural 
complexity than synthetic molecules [1–4] . However, a drawback for 
some natural products, particularly those with sizeable structural com- 
plexity, is that they can be challenging to synthesize. A workaround for 
this issue is the so-called pseudo-natural products which are syntheti- 
cally feasible compounds generated through a de novo combination of 
natural product fragments [3] . Pseudo-natural products allow the explo- 
ration of uncharted areas of biologically relevant chemical space that 
are diﬀerent from the chemical space covered by the compounds from 
which they are generated. 
The Collection of Open NatUral ProdUcTs (COCONUT) and the 
Universal Natural Product Database (UNPD) are two large compound 
databases. COCONUT [5] is arguably the most extensive public natu- 
ral product database, with 389,184 unique structures. UNPD [6] , with 
153,375 natural products, is the second-largest public natural prod- 
uct database. A distinctive feature of UNPD compared to COCONUT is 
that compounds in UNPD contain chirality information. In Latin Amer- 
ica, several public natural products databases compile the compounds 
isolated and characterized from the country of origin. Examples are

NuBBE DB [ 7 , 8 ], SistematX [ 9 , 10 ] from Brazil; CIFPMA [ 11 , 12 ] from 
Panama; PeruNPDB [13] from Peru; and BIOFACQUIM [ 14 , 15 ] from 
Mexico. The latter database contains the structures of 531 natural prod- 
ucts. 
De novo design generates virtual molecules from scratch. It ﬁlters 
structures generated using several scoring functions and assesses syn- 
thetic chemical feasibility to remove reactive and unrealistic compounds 
[16] . De novo design based on generative algorithms such as deep learn- 
ing involves using neural networks [ 17 , 18 ] and databases with many 
compounds [19] . In the source compound databases, many compounds 
with three-dimensional information ( e.g. , stereochemistry) are relevant 
to build robust generative models [20] . However, for several research 
groups, it is diﬃcult to access supercomputer resources to handle many 
compounds to obtain appropriate subsets that impact the model predic- 
tion [ 21 , 22 ]. 
This Communication reports the selection and characterization of the 
most diverse compounds from UNPD. The subsets were selected using a 
dissimilarity-based compound selection (DBCS) method, the MaxMin al- 
gorithm [23] . The compound subsets were characterized by the Natural 
Product Likeness (NPL) score [24] , structural diversity, and distribution 
in chemical space. The structural diversity was assessed with the Tani- 
moto coeﬃcient and molecular ﬁngerprints of diﬀerent designs. Chem- 
ical space analysis was performed through the visual representation of 
the chemical multiverse [25] using T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor

Fig. 1. MaxMin algorithm implemented in this work. A database 
(UNPD) was split into a given number of subsets. From each sub- 
set, a random compound (X) was selected. The molecular similar- 
ity was calculated between X and each compound (A, B, C, D, and 
E) from the subset using the Tanimoto coeﬃcient and the ECFP4 
ﬁngerprint. In this ﬁgure, only a subset (that contains the com- 
pounds A, B, C, D, and E) is shown for illustrative purposes. The 
compound with the smallest molecular similarity was chosen and 
deleted from the original subset. The process was repeated to gen- 
erate a new subset with the number of compounds desired. 
Embedding t-SNE [26] and the recently proposed Tree MAP (TMAP) 
[27] . We anticipate that the natural product subsets generated and thor- 
oughly characterized in this work will be helpful to the scientiﬁc com- 
munity in a variety of tasks including building generative models, in 
particular to those research groups with limited access to large super- 
computer resources. 
2. Materials and methods 
2.1. Data sets 
For this study, diﬀerent types of databases with compounds from var- 
ious origins were used including three data sets of natural products, and 
a data set focused on a speciﬁc molecular target of pharmaceutical rele- 
vance. Natural product databases from diﬀerent sources were employed 
to compare the NPL score of the UNPD subsets (described in the Natu- 
ral product-likeness section). The data set focused on a speciﬁc molecu- 
lar target and the natural products from diﬀerent sources were used to 
evaluate and compare the molecular diversity of UNPD subsets. Using a 
focused database gives a value of low structural diversity, which serves 
as a reference to compare the structural diversity of the UNPD subsets. 
Likewise, the chemical structures from other natural product databases 
served as reference compound collections to evaluate the diversity of 
the data sets newly generated. Each type of data set and its contents are 
described below. 
Three data sets of natural products were used, namely, COCONUT, 
UNPD, and BIOFACQUIM. COCONUT [5] had 389,184 unique struc- 
tures, not including chirality information. UNPD [6] with 153,372 
natural products, encoding their chirality. BIOFACQUIM [ 14 , 15 ] is a 
database with 531 natural products isolated and characterized in Mex- 
ico, and the chirality of the compounds is included. A data set with 715 
compounds focused on DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) inhibitors. 
DNMT1 is an epigenetic target relevant to drug discovery [ 28 , 29 ]. The 
data set of DNMT1 inhibitors was obtained from the ChEMBL database, 
release 31 [ 30 , 31 ]. 
2.2. Data set standardization 
The preparation of compounds, encoded in SMILES strings [32] was 
performed using the open-source cheminformatics toolkit RDKit 
[33] and MolVS [34] . Compounds with valence errors or any chemi- 
cal element other than H, B, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Se, Br, and I, were 
removed. Stereochemistry information, when available, was retained. 
Compounds with multiple components were split, and the largest com- 
ponent was retained. The remaining compounds were neutralized and 
reionized to generate the corresponding canonical tautomer. 
2.3. Natural product-likeness 
The NPL score, introduced by Ertl et al. [24] , was computed for 
all compounds in COCONUT, UNPD, and BIOFACQUIM. The NPL score

ranges between − 5 (if the compound is more similar to a synthetic com- 
pound) and 5 (if the compound is more similar to a natural product). 
2.4. Selection of sets of diverse compounds 
Dissimilarity-based compound selection (DBCS) methods allow the 
identiﬁcation of diverse compound data sets by directly calculating dis- 
tances or dissimilarities between the chemical structures [23] . Among 
the DBCS methods, the MaxMin algorithm reduces the number of com- 
pounds choosing the molecules with the largest diversity from the origi- 
nal databases. Three subsets of UNPD were generated using the MaxMin 
algorithm as follows ( Fig. 1 ): The initial 153,372 compounds from UNPD 
were split into three ways: (A) thirty random subsets of 5,000 com- 
pounds each; (B) ﬁfteen random subsets of 10,000 compounds each; and 
(C) ten random subsets of 15,000 compounds each. A new diverse set 
with 500 compounds was selected from each one using MaxMin [23] . 
First, a random compound was picked from each subset. The binary 
similarity between the compound selected (query set) and the remain- 
ing compounds (target set) was calculated. A new compound was se- 
lected from the target set if this had the lowest similarity value and 
then removed from the target set. The iteration process continued un- 
til the number of compounds desired set to 500 was reached. In total, 
three diverse subsets from UNPD were generated: UNPD-A (15,000 com- 
pounds), UNPD-B (7,500), and UNPD-C (5,000). For the diversity selec- 
tion, we used the Tanimoto coeﬃcient and the extended connectivity 
ﬁngerprint (ECFP) [35] of 1024-bits and diameter 4 (ECFP4). For the di- 
versity set calculations, we used an E5–2670v1 processor, 16 cores, and 
64 Gbytes of RAM). The maximum calculation time for each initial sub- 
set of the natural product subsets were: UNPD-A (15,000 compounds), 
19,989.21 s; UNPD-B (7,500 compounds), 102,569.61 s, and UNPD-C 
(5,000 compounds), 209,241.25 s. 
2.5. Structural diversity 
The structural diversity of three UNPD subsets, UNPD, BIOFAC- 
QUIM, and DNMT1, was compared through the distribution of the pair- 
wise similarity values generated with the Tanimoto coeﬃcient using 
three molecular ﬁngerprints Molecular ACCes System (MACCS) Keys 
(166-bits) [36] , extended connectivity ﬁngerprint (ECFP) [35] of 1024- 
bits with diameter 6 (ECFP6) and diameter 4 (ECFP4). 
2.6. Chemical multiverse visualization 
The chemical multiverse [25] of the three UNPD subsets was com- 
pared to the chemical multiverse of the entire UNPD collection. A chem- 
ical multiverse is a group of numerical vectors that diﬀerently describe 
a set of molecules depending on the molecular representation [25] . So, 
each chemical space is an M-dimensional cartesian space in which com- 
pounds are located by a set of M descriptors. Each type of molecular

colors, UNPD-A (pink), UNPD-B (green), UNPD-C (red), and UNPD (blue). Black diamonds represent outliers. 
ﬁngerprint generates a distinct chemical space, and the sets of chem- 
ical spaces comprise the chemical multiverse. For this work, the vi- 
sual representation of the chemical multiverse was done using t-SNE 
[26] and TMAPs [27] as visualization methods, and MACCS keys (166 
bits), ECFP4, and ECFP6 as molecular representations. 
The t-SNE generates plots that organize compounds. Similar com- 
pounds form clusters and dissimilar compounds are distant from each 
other. TMAP allows visualizing of many chemical compounds through 
the distance between clusters. Local Sensitive Hashing (LSH) allows each 
compound to be grouped hierarchically according to common substruc- 
tures using molecular ﬁngerprints. The number of nearest neighbors, 
k = 50, and the factor used by the augmented query algorithm, kc = 10, 
were used to develop the TMAP graphs. In previous studies, we used 
TMAP to describe the molecular diversity of natural products such as 
COCONUT [2] , BIOFACQUIM [15] , and a focused library of HIV-1 pro- 
tease inhibitors using natural fragments from COCONUT [37] . 
3. Results and discussion 
3.1. Natural-product-likeness 
Table 1 summarizes the descriptive statistics for NPL scores calcu- 
lated for BIOFACQUIM, UNPD, and COCONUT. The COCONUT, UNPD, 
and BIOFACQUIM had NPL score values in the range of [ − 3.53,4.08], 
[ − 2.51,4.08], and [ − 0.36,3.87], respectively. As anticipated, natural 
product compounds from COCONUT, UNPD, and BIOFACQUIM had 
NPL scores ca. 4. Only 25% of COCONUT´s compounds (min = − 3.53, 
Q1 = − 0.32) had NPL scores ca. − 3.53, and 25% of UNPD´s compounds 
(min = − 2.51, Q1 = 1.14) had NPL close to − 2.51 meaning that COCONUT 
had compounds with more chemical structures similar to synthetic com- 
pounds regarding the UNPD because of NPL scores ca. − 5 is associated 
with compounds derived from the synthetic origin [24] . In general, nat- 
ural products (COCONUT, UNPD, BIOFACQUIM) had NPL values closer 
to 5. 
3.2. Molecular diversity 
Three subsets of UNPD (A-C) were generated using the MaxMin al- 
gorithm, as described in Section 2.4 . UNPD-A, UNPD-B, and UNPD- 
C had 15,000, 7,500, and 5,000 compounds, respectively. Then, the 
new subsets were curated, as described in Section 2.2 . Table 2 shows 
that six, three, two, and one duplicated compounds were found in 
UNPD-A, UNPD-B, and UNPD-C, respectively (between 0.04% and 
0.02%). Fig. 2 shows the cumulative distribution functions (CDF) of 
the pairwise Tanimoto similarity using MACCS keys (166-bits), ECFP4, 
and ECFP6, as molecular representations. The UNPD subsets (A-C) 
are represented in continous line as UNPD-A (pink), UNPD-B (green), 
and UNPD-C (red); UNPD (blue); BIOFACQUIM (yellow); and DNMT1 
(cyan). The CDF with ECFP4 and ECFP6 shows that UNPD subsets 
(A-C) were the most diverse data sets (median = 0.09); followed by 
the UNPD (median = 0.1), BIOFACQUIM (median = 0.12), and DNMT1 
(median = 0.12). The CDF with MACCS keys shows that UNPD subsets 
(A-C) were the most diverse (median = 0.3) and UNPD (median = 0.4), 
followed by DNMT1 (median = 0.4) and BIOFACQUIM (median = 0.43). 
Likewise, Table 2 shows that UNPD subsets were more diverse than 
UNPD, DIFACQUIM, and DNMT1. The UNPD-A was the most di-

verse dataset and had the lowest median similarity value (0.091, 
0.077) calculated with ECFP4 and ECFP6, respectively, followed by 
the UNPD-B (0.094, 0.08), and UNPD-C (0.092, 0.079); and the refer- 
ence databases: UNPD (0.111, 0.094), BIOFACQUIM (0.119, 0.099) and 
DNMT1 (0.119, 0.1). The structural diversity calculated with MACCS 
keys ( Table 2 and Fig. 2 ) indicated that UNPD subsets had the same 
trend, being the UNPD-A the most diverse (median = 0.341) followed 
by UNPD-B (median = 0.346), and UNPD-C (median = 0.356); followed 
by UNPD (median = 0.43), BIOFACQUIM (median = 0.447), and DNMT1 
(median = 0.417). For UNPD, the data set generated from a larger num- 
ber of subsets (thirty versus ﬁfteen or ten subsets) was the most diverse, 
i.e. , UNPD-A according to the ECFP4, ECFP6, and MACCS keys ﬁnger- 
prints. 
3.3. Properties of pharmaceutical relevance 
The natural products subsets were further characterized by means 
of the distribution of six properties of pharmaceutical relevance: hy- 
drogen bond donors (HBD), hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA), topo- 
logical polar surface area (TPSA), number of rotatable bonds (RB), 
molecular weight (MW), and partition coeﬃcient octanol/water (LogP). 
Fig. 3 shows box-whisker plots of the distribution of the property 
values calculated for the three UNPD subsets and the entire UNPD 
(UNPD-A (pink), UNPD-B (green), UNPD-C (red), and UNPD (blue)). 
Tables 3-5 summarize the descriptive statistics. Fig. 3 and Tables 3- 
5 show that 75% of compounds of UNPD subsets and UNPD had 
the same range of LogP values, namely UNPD-A: LogP < = 4.32, UNPD-

polar surface area, number of rotatable bonds, molecular weight, and partition coeﬃcient octanol/water. The datasets are represented in scatter points as UNPD-A 
(pink), UNPD-B (green), UNPD-C (red), and UNPD (blue). Panel A shows the UNPD subsets (A-C), and panel B shows the entire UNPD. 
B: LogP < = 4.24, UNPD-C: LogP < = 4.45, and UNPD: LogP < = 4.58. Re- 
garding MW and TPSA, 75% of UNPD’s compounds (TPSA < = 145.91 
and MW < = 534.66) were more diverse than 75% of UNPD subsets 
(A-C): UNPD-A’s compounds (TPSA < = 112.05, MW < = 445.60); UNPD- 
B’s compounds (TPSA < = 116.20, MW < = 444.48), and UNPD-C’s com- 
pounds (TPSA < = 116.61, MW < = 466.74). Regarding RB, UNPD’s com- 
pounds (RB < = 8.0) and UNPD-B’s compounds (RB < = 7.0) were more di- 
verse than UNPD-A’s compounds (RB < = 6.0) and UNPD-C’s compounds 
(RB < = 6.0). Regarding HBA and HBD, UNPD’s compounds (HBD < = 4.0, 
HBA < = 9.0) and UNPD-C’s compounds (HBD < = 4.0, HBA < = 8.0) were 
more diverse than UNPD-A (HBD < = 3.0, HBA < = 7.0) and UNPD-B 
(HBD < = 4.0, HBA < = 7.0). Overall, the UNPD-C dataset was the most di- 
verse in terms of the properties of pharmaceutical relevance after the 
entire UNPD. 
3.4. Visualization of the chemical space and chemical multiverse 
As described in Section 2.6 , a chemical multiverse is conceptualized 
as a group of molecular representations that each describe a compound 
dataset (in contrast to a chemical space that is deﬁned by only one set of 
descriptors). Fig. 4 shows a visual representation of the chemical mul- 
tiverse of the UNPD datasets using TMAPs and MACCS keys (166-bits), 
ECFP4, and ECFP6 as molecular representations. In this study, the chem- 
ical multiverse is comprised of three molecular ﬁngerprints: one based 
on structural keys, MACCS keys ( Fig. 4 A); and the hashed molecular 
ﬁngerprint, ECFP4 and ECFP6 ( Figs. 4 B and C). The data sets are repre- 
sented in scatter points with diﬀerent colors as UNPD-A (pink), UNPD-B 
(green), and UNPD-C (red). The overlap between diﬀerent data sets is 
depicted in gray. The TMAP generated with MACCS keys shows fewer 
clusters with more compounds than ECFP4 and ECFP6. For natural prod- 
ucts, the TMAP generated with ECFP6 shows that the compounds of the 
UNPD subsets are more evenly distributed with respect to the TMAPs 
constructed with ECFP4 and MACCS keys. The chemical multiverse rep- 
resented by ECFP6 is more accurate in describing the structural diversity 
than ECFP4 because ECFP6 encodes molecular fragments in more detail 
than ECFP4 [35] and thus has an impact on quantifying structural di- 
versity. 
We also visualize the chemical space of the datasets using t-SNE 
based on the six physicochemical properties of pharmaceutical inter- 
est discussed in Section 3.3 . Fig. 5 A shows the chemical space of UNPD 
subsets (A-C). Each data point represents a compound: UNPD-A (pink), 
UNPD-B (green), and UNPD-C (red). As reference, Fig. 5 B depicts a vi- 
sualization of the chemical space of the entire UNPD (blue data points). 
t-SNE in Fig. 5 A shows that the three UNPD subsets overlap with diverse 
regions of the chemical space of UNPD ( Fig. 5 B). UNPD-C was the most 
diverse regarding the six physicochemical properties of pharmaceutical 
interest, as described before in Section 3.3 . 
3.5. Applications of selection of subsets in drug discovery 
The herein diverse subsets derived from natural products annotated 
with chirality information can be used in several diﬀerent ways. For 
example, they can be used as reference sets for diversity analysis and 
coverage of chemical space of other compound libraries. For instance, 
Vivek-Ananth et al. recently reported a comparative analysis of more 
than 1800 secondary metabolites of medicinal fungi [38] . In that work, 
the authors included nine reference databases including natural prod- 
ucts datasets. The same research group has reported and characterized 
an extensive database of Indian Medicinal Plants, Phytochemistry, and 
Therapeutics [39] . Having diverse subsets from UNDP included herein 
would further expand the outcome of such diversity studies. Other ap- 
plications of the diverse subsets include its use in the development of 
generative models, such as de novo design. This approach generates new 
chemical entities with the properties desired, and recently uses algo- 
rithms of deep learning [16] . Deep learning algorithms require a large 
number of compounds, but it means more computer resources. The ra- 
tional design of drugs involves quality data [40] to develop good models 
with the best predictions [21] , and computer scientists advise the use of 
algorithms that can detect meaningful patterns in small data sets char- 
acteristics of the early stage of drug discovery can generate prospective 
studies [41] . For instance, a ﬁrst approach to de novo design is to start 
7

from small data sets of compounds with diverse structures and diverse 
properties of pharmaceutical relevance herein generated; and add to the 
distinctive structural complexity and diversity of the natural products as 
a larger fraction of sp 3 carbon atoms and chiral centers [ 3 , 4 ]. 
4. Conclusions 
We report the selection and characterization of the three subsets 
with the most diverse compounds from UNPD using the MaxMin algo- 
rithm. Three subsets with 14,994, 7497, and 4998 compounds selected 
from the UNPD contain the most structurally diverse natural products. 
Unlike compounds in the COCONUT database, molecules in UNPD are 
annotated with chirality. The structural diversity of compounds is not 
aﬀected by the number of subsets derived from the original database 
from which a new database is generated, and an analysis of the chem- 
ical multiverse supports that UNPD subsets contain the most diverse 
molecules. During the study, we also concluded that the visualization 
of the chemical space described with ECFP6 is more accurate to de- 
scribe the structural diversity of compounds compared with ECFP4 and 
MACCS keys (166 bits). The natural product subsets had a large diversity 
of chemical compounds with diﬀerent structural features and properties 
of pharmaceutical relevance. The NPL score supports that the chemical 
structures of natural products are very diﬀerent and diverse as deﬁned 
by the threshold of the NPL score, and as expected, natural products 
(COCONUT, UNPD, and BIOFACQUIM) had NPL scores values close to 
5. 
A signiﬁcant perspective of this work is that the natural product sub- 
sets derived from the UNPD can be used to develop generative models 
that use deep learning algorithms and require the most diverse com- 
pounds, such as de novo design. The natural products subsets can also 
be used to develop predictive models; for virtual screening; and refer- 
ence databases for evaluating the structural diversity or similarity to 
a speciﬁc subset, among other applications. The public availability of 
the natural product subsets can save costly computational resources for 
research groups with limited accessibility to supercomputer means.
