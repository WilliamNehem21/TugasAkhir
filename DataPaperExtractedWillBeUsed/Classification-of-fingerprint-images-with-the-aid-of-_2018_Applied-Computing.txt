The uniqueness, public recognition, ﬁrmness, and their least jeopardy of ﬁngerprints made an extensively
and proﬁciently utilized personal authentication metrics. Fingerprint technology is a biometric method
that is used to recognize persons on the basis of their physical traits. These physical forms comprise of
ridges and valleys prevailing on the surface of ﬁngertips. Fingerprint images are direction-oriented pat-
tern fashioned using ridges and valleys. The reputation of the ﬁngerprint image regulates the durability of
a ﬁngerprint authentication scheme. For enhancing the restrictions of prevailing ﬁngerprint image aug-
mentation approaches we have proposed an effectual method to pact with various ﬁngerprint images.
The proposed methodology alienated into three modules. Primarily, the ﬁngerprint image is endangered
to denoising procedure where Wave atom transform is used. Once this procedure is accomplished the
image augmentation is achieved for improving the classiﬁcation rate. The morphological operation is
used in our proposed technique in order to augment the image. The morphological operators such as dila-
tion and area opening are used here for improvement. Finally the ordering of ﬁngerprint image is done.
Adaptive Genetic Neural Network (AGNN) is used for classiﬁcation of images efﬁciently.

1. Introduction
In this extremely electronically harmonized society, authentic
appreciation is crucial in numerous arenas of life. An entity’s phys-
iological and behavioral features, acknowledged as biometrics, are
important tools utilized for documentation and authentication [7].
Biometric schemes have been extensively utilized in numerous
implementations namely access control, law enforcement schemes
and border management schemes to human empathy grounded on
biological traits like face, ﬁngerprints, iris, etc. Currently, an exten-
sive variability of methods has been established to accomplish the
rising demand for safety [8]. In today’s atmosphere of augmented
prominence of safety and association, documentation and authen-
tication approaches have industrialized into a key technology. Such
obligation for dependable personal empathy in electronic access
control has occasioned in the augmented awareness in biometrics
[10].
The uniqueness and perseverance of ﬁngerprint images and its
technology, become the most mature biometrics and is extensively
implemented to ID conﬁrm scheme. Fingerprint image quality sig-
niﬁcantly affects the presentation of ﬁngerprint identiﬁcation
scheme, so it is beneﬁcial and essential for assessing the composed
ﬁngerprint images quality in the ﬁngerprint recognition system
[1]. Currently, the ﬁngerprint is the most frequently utilized bio-
metric identiﬁer in authentication schemes [4]. Natural ﬁnger-
prints are unevenly characterized into three generic patterns
rendering to the complete ﬂow of ridgelines: Arch, Loop, and
Whorl. Considering more details like the presence and comparative
positions of core and delta in ﬁngerprint images, ﬁngerprint exam-
iners further distribute each generic pattern into two or four sub-
groups [2].
The uniqueness of ﬁnger print identiﬁcation scheme needs an
assessment of his/her ﬁngerprints with all the ﬁngerprints in the
database to designate individuals in the storage. Selection of clas-
siﬁcation method signiﬁcantly decreases the number of compar-
isons throughout ﬁngerprint recovery and therefore decrease the
response time of the identiﬁcation procedure [3]. Fingerprint

characteristic features. There are principally two types of features
utilized in ﬁngerprint matching: local features and universal fea-
tures. Two greatest pertinent local features, known as minutiae,
are ridge ending and ridge bifurcation, while universal features
are distinctiveness points, speciﬁcally core and delta [5]. The minu-
tia set is the most extensively utilized ﬁngerprint feature. Current
development in ﬁngerprint reconstruction has illustrated that,
from the minutia set only, we attain much data about a ﬁngerprint
[6]. The procedure of ﬁngerprint documentation is usually done in
two stages: a coarse mapping with the help of classiﬁcation and by
ﬁltering the local singularities mapping [9].
The paper is summarized as follows. In Section 2 provides a
brief account about the current research work that is performed
in the ﬁeld of face acknowledgment. Section 3 elucidates the pro-
posed system of ﬁngerprint image organization by proposed Adap-
tive Genetic Neural Network (AGNN). Section 4 provides the
results and discussion of our anticipated technique and Section 5
lastly concludes our proposed technique.
2. Related work
Abundant research works are performed in the ﬁeld of ﬁnger-
print image organization recently. Some of the current investiga-
tions done in the ﬁeld of ﬁngerprint image organization are
deﬁned in this section, ﬁngerprint classiﬁcation refers to conveying
a ﬁngerprint image into a number of pre-speciﬁed classes, gives an
achievable indexing mechanism. In the area of criminal exploration
the mission of classifying ﬁngerprints consumes much time and
labor. Frequent attempts have been made to systematize the clas-
siﬁcation procedure with the help of conventional image process-
ing methods but very few have been comprised with the help of
law implementation agencies because of their restricted achieve-
ments in resolving the issue. The repetition of curiosity in neural
networks in current years has wedged the courtesy of those convo-
luted in ﬁngerprint recognition as they begin to distinguish the
potential recompenses of a neural network method. Ebtesam
Najim Abdullah AlShemmary [11] deﬁned a method to ﬁngerprint
classiﬁcation on the basis of both individualities and neural net-
work investigation. As noise occurs in many of the ﬁngerprint
images comprising those in the NIST databases that are utilized
by numerous investigators, it was challenging to acquire the cor-
rect number and situation of the singularities like core or delta
points that are extensively utilized in current structural classiﬁca-
tion methods.
A few transitional solutions on ﬁngerprint organization adopt-
ing a neural network as decision stage were given by Patil and Sur-
alkar [12]. The neural network was equipped to accomplish
matching procedure and was effectively industrialized to recognize
and categorize the ﬁngerprint by back propagation algorithm. The
investigational solutions presented the technique proposed could
progress ﬁngerprint image quality classiﬁcation accuracy more
efﬁciently than others.
The themes of ﬁngerprint cataloguing, indexing, and reposses-
sion have been premeditated broadly in the previous ten years.
One issue faced by investigators was that in all publicly accessible
ﬁngerprint databases, only some ﬁngerprint sections from each
individual are accessible for training and testing, creating it unsuit-
able to usage urbane statistical approaches for recognition. C.
Leung and C. H. Leung [13] attempted the issue by chief affectedly
intensifying the group of training samples with the help of our pro-
posed spatial modeling method. With the prolonged training set,
they were capable to engage a more urbane classiﬁer like the Bayes
classiﬁer for recognition. They implemented the proposed process
to the issue of one-to- ﬁngerprint documentation and retrieval.
An algorithm to perceive and remedy skin distortion grounded
on a single ﬁngerprint image was presented by Si et al. [14]. Distor-
tion recognition was regarded as a two-class classiﬁcation issue, for
that the enumerated ridge orientation map and epoch map of a ﬁn-
gerprint are utilized as the feature vector and a SVM classiﬁer was
skilled to accomplish the organization mission. Distortion rectiﬁca-
tion was observed as a regression issue, where the input was a mis-
leading ﬁngerprint and the output was the distortion ﬁeld. To
resolve this issue, a database (known reference database) of numer-
ous distorted reference ﬁngerprints and consistent distortion ﬁelds
was manufactured in the ofﬂine stage, and then in the online stage,
the adjacent neighbor of the input ﬁngerprint was instituted in the
reference database and the consistent distortion ﬁeld was utilized
to transmute the input ﬁngerprint into a usual one.
Raid Al-Nima et al. [15] proposed human authentication
method in which Finger Texture (FT) patterns was used to make
it efﬁcient. To differentiate the ﬁngers from the hand images, a
robust
and
automatic
ﬁnger
extraction
method
was
used.
Enhanced Local Line Binary Pattern (ELLBP) was used to extract
new features. The information embedded within the poorly imaged
regions of the FTs a method is suggested to salvage missing feature
elements. Classiﬁcation was done by performing Probabilistic Neu-
ral Network (PNN).
Al-Nima et al. [16] deﬁned an approach which authenticates
based on their ﬁnger textures. Finger Texture (FT) features of the
four ﬁnger images (index, middle, ring and little) are extracted
from a low resolution contactless hand image. To enhance the
FTs, new Image Feature Enhancement (IFE) was used method to
enhance the FTs. The resulting feature image is segmented and a
Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) is employed to classify intelli-
gently for recognition.
Fingerprint image improvement was one among the greatest
crucial stages in an automated ﬁngerprint identiﬁcation scheme.
Wang et al. [17] deﬁned an operative algorithm for ﬁngerprint
image quality enhancement. The algorithm involves of two phases.
The primary stage was disintegrating the input ﬁngerprint image
into four subbands by implementing two-dimensional discrete
wavelet transform. At the secondary phase, the remunerated image
was fashioned by adaptively procurement the compensation coef-
ﬁcient for each subband on the basis of the mentioned Gaussian
template. The proposed algorithm could progress the clarity and
continuity of ridge ediﬁces in a ﬁngerprint image.
3. Proposed methodology
Fingerprints are a consistently individual identiﬁcation biomet-
rics because of the singularity, dependability through life, unique-
ness among individuals, public acceptance and their minimum risk
of intrusion. Because of its uniqueness among people ﬁngerprint
authentication is generally acknowledged in all method for efforts
to establish safety. Unique ﬁngerprint images are bearing focused
example framed by ridges and valleys where the physical patterns
comprise of ridges and valleys existing on the surface of ﬁngertips.
Fingerprints ridges assume a vital part in the enhancement of ﬁn-
gerprints. An effective strategy to manage unique ﬁngerprint
images and the enhancement of such images with better quality
yield in our proposed work.
In order to enhance the limitations of existing unique ﬁnger-
print image enhancement methods we proposed an effective
method to manage ﬁnger impression pictures. The proposed
methodology can be classiﬁed into three modules. To begin with,
the ﬁngerprint image is subjected to denoising process where
Wave Atom Transform is used. When this procedure is ﬁnished
the image enhancement is performed in order to improve the
classiﬁcation rate. The morphological operation is used in our pro-
S.R. Borra et al. / Applied Computing and Informatics 14 (2018) 166–176
167
posed method in order to enhance the image quality. The morpho-
logical operators like dilation and area opening are used here for
improvement. The last stage of proposed method is the classiﬁca-
tion of ﬁngerprint image. Here we have used Adaptive genetic neu-
ral system (AGNN) for ﬁngerprint classiﬁcation (see Fig. 1).
3.1. Wave atom transform
The wave Atom Transform is utilized for denoising the images
where the images that are to be processed in system have to be ﬁn-
ished noise free. To de-noise the image by the Wave Atom Trans-
form executes the consequent stages:
Step 1: Apply the right circular movement process to the input
image. This is the initial step utilized for noise removal utilizing
the wave atom transfer.
Step 2: At the point when the right circular movement is ﬁn-
ished, we initiate the forward 2D Wave atom transform.
Step 3: The wave atom coefﬁcients obtained using 2D Wave
atom transform is subjected to hard thresholding inorder to
improve the image quality
Step 4: Inverse 2D wave atom transform is applied to the above
result for reﬁning the process of waveatom transform.
Step 5: The ﬁnal stage in the denoising process is the applica-
tion of left circular shift to the result obtained at the step 4,
which completes the denoising process.
Wave molecule changes are utilized with the directional casing
to expel noise in ﬁnger print images. Once the denoising is done,
the following stage in our proposed framework is the image up
gradation where we use morphological operation for improving
the ﬁngerprint images.
3.2. Image enhancement using morphological operation
In the wake of denoising of the images by modifying the con-
trast and intensity of the image utilizing waveatom change, mor-
phological operation is performed on the image. In morphological
operation, the estimation of every pixel in the yield image depends
on a correlation of the comparing pixel in the output with its
neighbors. By picking the size and shape of the area, we develop
a morphological operation that is delicate to particular shapes in
the input image. Here two morphological operations, for example,
dilation and area opening.
� Dilation:
In dilation, the estimation of the output pixel is the most
extreme estimation of the considerable number of pixels in the
input pixel’s neighborhood. In a binary image, if any of the pixels
is set to the level 1, the yield pixel is set to 1. It is utilized to build
the object in the image. It has the condition,
gSðIÞ ¼ fijSi \ I–/g
ð1Þ
where Si means S translated with i, I is the image and S is the struc-
ture element.
� Area opening:
From a binary image the ﬁlter that its connected components
with area smaller than a parameter q is called area opening. From
a morphological perspective, this ﬁlter is an algebraic opening, and
it can be extended to grayscale images. In particular, the area open-
ing of parameter q of an image I is the supremum of the grayscale
images that are smaller than I and whose regional maxima are of
area greater than or equal to q .It can be deﬁned as:
Let I � Q and q � 0: The area of opening of parameter q of I is
given by
n g
qðIÞ ¼ fi 2 IjAðHiðIÞÞ � qg
ð2Þ
Apparently, if ðInÞn2N denote the connected components of
N; n g
qðIÞ is equal to the union of Nn’s with area greater than or equal
to q:
n g
qðIÞ ¼ [fInjn 2 N; AðInÞ �g
ð3Þ
By using these morphological operation maximum intensity
pixels of the image alone is selected. Thus, the operation employed
contrast and intensity adjusted image is further enhanced by uti-
lizing the morphological operation. After morphological operation
stage, the ﬁnal stage is the classiﬁcation of ﬁngerprint image with
the aid of AGNN.
3.3. Classiﬁcation using Adaptive Genetic Neural Network (AGNN)
The Adaptive Genetic Neural Network is used to determine the
ﬁnger print classiﬁcation and it is skilled by engaging the features
values that are extracted from each and every image. The Adaptive
Genetic Neural Network is well skilled by the way of the extracted
features. The Adaptive Genetic Neural Network is home-based to
three input units, n unseen units and one output unit. The input
of the neural network is the feature vector we have abstracted
from the images. The network is qualiﬁed under a great group of
dissimilar ﬁngerprint images to permit them to efﬁciently catego-
rize the exact query image in the testing stage. The neural network
works making usage of two stages, one is the training phase and
the further is the testing phase.

Training phase
In the training stage, the input image is subjected to feature
extraction and this feature vector is given as the input to the neural
system. Primarily, the nodes are speciﬁed with random weights. As
the output is previously recognized in the training phase, the out-
put attained from the neural network is associated with the origi-
nal and weights are diverse so as to decrease the error. This
procedure is performed for a great number of images so as to pro-
vide a stable scheme having weights allocated in the nodes.
Multilayer feed forward neural network is used in our proce-
dure. The structure is portrayed in Fig. 2. The input layer has N
neurons i.e. number of matrix elements, the unseen layer has Nsl
neurons and the output layer has N neurons i.e. the number of
typescripts ranging from A to Z and letters 0–9. Back propagation
algorithm is utilized to train the neural network that is designated
as follows.
Step 1: Produce arbitrary weights between the interval [0, 1]
and dispense it to the hidden layer neurons and also the output
layer neurons. Preserve a unity value weight for all neurons of
the input layer.
Step 2: Input the training dataset D to the classiﬁer and regulate
the BP error as trails
BPE ¼ OT � ONN

that can be dogged as ONN ¼ ½oð1Þ

ð6Þ
Eqs. (5) and (6) signiﬁes the activation performance achieved in
the output layer and hidden layer correspondingly.
Step 3: Regulate the weights of all neurons as we ¼ we þ Dwe,
where, Dwe is the change in weight that can be dogged as
Dwe ¼ r:O2:BPE
ð7Þ
In Eq. (7), r is the learning rate, frequently it ranges from 0.2 to
0.5.
Step 4: Reprise the procedure from step 2, till BP error gets
diminished to a least value. Virtually, the standard to be grati-
ﬁed is BPE < 0:1.
Testing phase
In the testing stage, the input image is applied to the trained
neural network having speciﬁc weights in the hubs and the yield
is ascertained to classify the images taking into account the trained
dataset. In common neural network the procedure will be halted in
the wake of testing. In the proposed modiﬁed neural network, for
testing process we have consolidated the optimization technique
inorder to enhance the weight utilized for testing. In our proposed
strategy the weights are improved with the assistance of the
Genetic algorithm. By integrating optimization procedure the clas-
siﬁcation accuracy will be enhanced there by giving improved
recognition of the images. The assembly of the artiﬁcial neural net-
work is demonstrated in Fig. 2.
3.3.1. Weight optimization using genetic algorithms
With a speciﬁc end goal to keep up assortment over the span of
optimization process the components are isolated into chromo-
somes in the suggested ﬁngerprint classiﬁcation technique by
means of adaptive GA. Till the most incredible solution are got past

somes raced using the implementation of genetic operators end in
the production of fresh individuals. To accomplish the level of vari-
ety the rate of migration authorities the algorithm and is sustained
privileged the chromosomes.
Step 1: Generation of chromosome
The input for AGA is the random weights which are used for
training phase in neural network. The generation of chromo-
some for the optimization is the initial phase of GA. Here, ‘N’
numbers of chromosomes are generated from the solution
space. The initial chromosome are indicated using the below
expression,
Ci ¼ ½cðnÞ
0 cðnÞ
1 . . . cðnÞ
Q�1�; 0 6 n 6 Q � 1; 0 6 k 6 P � 1
ð8Þ
where, cðnÞ
k
is the k
th gene of the chromosome, Q is the population
pool, P is the length of the chromosome.
Step 2: Fitness function
A type of objective function is the Fitness function that is the
top target parameter to the optimized value. With the help of
the subsequent formula the ﬁtness performance is assessed.
Fn ¼
X
p
n¼1
wn=p
ð9Þ
On the basis of the threshold weight values the ﬁtness of every
chromosome is considered here. By picking the result and pro-
ceeding to step 5 or moving towards the succeeding step 3 is
done after scheming the ﬁtness values.
Step 3: Crossover operation
To attain a latest chromosome termed offspring, the crossover
operation is accomplished among two parent chromosomes.
The genes are selected and a latest child chromosome is fash-
ioned on the basis of the crossover rate COR. The ﬁtness function
is utilized to the lately fashioned child chromosome after con-
structing a new chromosome. The formula for calculating the
crossover rate is set as,
COR ¼ Gco
CL
ð10Þ
where,
COR – Crossover rate
Gco – Genes Crossover
CL – Chromosome length
The implemented crossover operation make sure that the
weights chosen for training the image, are supergenes endure
unbroken via the crossover operation that means no liability
can be go down out of the scheme or can be swapped. By treat-
ment a one-point crossover the crossover operation seams two
subsets of duties with their applicable values.
Step 4: Adaptive mutation operation
The recommended technique is based on GA by Adaptive Muta-
tion so that the union of the solution is quickened. On the basis
of the mutation rate ðMrÞ the mutation operation is conveyed
out. On the basis of the quantiﬁed mutation rate genes are
transformed individually here. The formula for mutation rate
is set as,
MUR ¼ MUPt
CL
ð11Þ
where MUPt is the mutation point, CL is chromosome length.
By changing the mutation point actively the mutation is accom-
plished adaptive in the recommended method as professed for-
mer.
With
respect
to
the
ﬁtness
of
the
accomplished
chromosome, the mutation point is accomplished to alter
dynamically. The mutation rate is designated on the basis of
the ﬁtness intended. At this time the ﬁtness is on the basis of
the errands and dependencies.
The vector that embodies the possible mutation points is pro-
vided as follows
MUPt ¼ fmu1; mu2; . . . ; muLg;
ð12Þ
At this point L signiﬁes the chromosome length. The mutation
rate will be recognized based on Fn.
MUn
R ¼
1; if Fn � T
0; else
�
ð13Þ
At this time T is intended on the basis of the average responsi-
bility value. The mutation is performed in the position consid-
ered in Eq. (7). It will be adaptively altered on the basis of the
ﬁtness value of every chromosome in iterations.
Step 5: Selection
At the time of the selection process, the Q comprehensively pro-
duce chromosomes and the Q novel chromosomes are situated
in a selection pool based on their ﬁtness values. The chromo-
somes that encompass good ﬁtness lodge the top positions of
the pool in the selection pool. The primary Q chromosomes that
are at the top of the selection pool are designated for the subse-
quent generation among the 2Q chromosomes. At this time the
selection is grounded on the ﬁtness and implementation time
for each task.
4. Results and discussion
The experiment was carried out in MATLAB (2015a) by applying
the proposed approach and Image Processing Toolbox was used to
produce the improved ﬁnger print image. Proposed methodology
was validated against FVC2000 dataset. The ﬁngerprint and fake
images are collected using the Fingerprint Veriﬁcation Competition
or FVC2000 [18] as well as from the samples that were drawn from
SFinGE. Different sensors are applied on FVC2000 to collect almost
four databases from this FVC2000 database. As the function of opti-
cal sensor is different for every individual, the samples collected
are different from each other. Low cost Optical sensor was used
to collect images for DB1. Low cost Capacitive Optical sensor was
used to collect images for DB2. DB3 is collated using a fairly size-
able quality of optical sensors. At last, databases DB4 is syntheti-
cally generated using SFinGE. These data base speciﬁcations are
given in Table 1 and the ample images are shown from Figs. 3–10.
Fig. 11 speciﬁed below displays the processed output for the
input ﬁngerprint images. Dissimilar query ﬁngerprint images are
implemented to our proposed scheme and are classiﬁed accord-
ingly and is portrayed in the below ﬁg.
As publicized in above ﬁgure, the input image is substance to
noise reduction and then improved by the morphological operation

such as dilation and opening. The improved images are then clas-
siﬁed on the basis of the input query image with the help of Adap-
tive genetic neural network. The categorized images are then
stowed for empathy. The presentations of proposed technique in
organization of exact images are then assessed and are associated
with that of available neural network.
4.1. Performance evaluation
The evaluation metrics like Precision, sensitivity, speciﬁcity,
accuracy and F-Measure are estimated in order to evaluate the per-
formance of the proposed system. These metrics are assessed for
different training testing percentages and are tabularized. Similar

metrics for the existing methods are also evaluated and tabulated
for comparing with proposed method. In our proposed scheme
we have utilized neural network which is one of the existing
method for classiﬁcation. The performance metrics are deﬁned in
Table 2.
� Precision shows the class agreement of the data labels with the
positive labels given by the classiﬁer.
� Sensitivity shows the effectiveness of a classiﬁer to identify the
positive labels.
� Speciﬁcity shows how effectively a classiﬁer identiﬁes the neg-
ative labels.
� Accuracy shows the overall effectiveness of a classiﬁer.
� F-measure shows the relation between data’s positive labels
and those given by a classiﬁer.
In [19] the author’s deﬁned non neural network approach for
classiﬁcation of images. Here they deﬁned threshold between the
values of the real data and the fake ones for the various non-
reference image quality measures (NR-IQM). Afterwards, in the
second stage, used the quality scores for a leave-one-out cross val-
idation to get an exact assertion about the classiﬁcation possibility
with NR-IQM. To classify data used k-nearest neighbors (kNN) clas-
siﬁcation. This method allowed testing all possible combinations of
IQM in a simple way. Finally the classiﬁcation accuracy for discrim-
inating real from fake images is calculated.
Tables 3and 4 given below illustrates the performance metrics
values such as Precision, sensitivity, speciﬁcity, accuracy and F-
measure attained by the proposed and NR-IQM with kNN approach
for different training and testing percentages. From the values
attained it is evident that proposed scheme has outdone the avail-
able technique.
Fig. 12 below depicts the graphical illustration of Precision
attained for the proposed and prevailing technique. The graph val-
idates that the planned scheme displays better Precision when
associated with available neural network technique.
Fig. 13 below indicates the graphical illustration of Accuracy
attained for the proposed and available technique. The graph vali-
dates that the proposed scheme exhibits better Accuracy when
weighed against the available neural network technique.
Fig. 14 indicated below presents the graphical view of Sensitiv-
ity accomplished for the proposed and existing strategy. The chart
conﬁrms that the proposed system shows better Sensitivity when

The training time and testing time required for the proposed
approach AGNN and other neural network approach along with
the non neural network approach NR-IQM with kNN are calculated
for various image quantities are given Figs. 17 and 18. Although the
time required to preprocess and classify the images correct or fake
by neural network takes more time than the proposed approach,
but the training and testing approaches in proposed approach
takes very minimum time and are efﬁcient than other methods.
5. Conclusion
In this work, in order to overcome the disadvantage of various
ﬁngerprint images an efﬁcient and productive procedure for
unique ﬁngerprint image classiﬁcation method was proposed.
The proposed technique uses Wave atom transform for denoising,
morphological operation for image upgradation and Adaptive
genetic neural system for image classiﬁcation. The proposed strat-
egy helped in classifying the images precisely in view of the image
under question since the images are upgraded and classiﬁer is
altered utilizing the enhancement systems. The outcomes acquired
demonstrates the adequacy of proposed AGNN based ﬁngerprint
classiﬁcation method as it conveys better parameter values like
Precision, sensitivity, speciﬁcity, accuracy and F-Measure when
contrasted with existing system neural network and non neural
network method NR-IQM with kNN approaches.
