Abstract 
An algorithm of multi-axis NC tool-path generation for subdivision surfaces is proposed. The algorithm includes two steps: 
model building and tool path generation. In the section of model building, in order to obtain the deformed surface, the 
deformation vector is computed which is associated with the curvature and the slope of cutter location surface. In the  
procedure of tool path generation, the slicing procedure is adopted to get the CL points. In addition, the inversely 
converted method is used. The method is tested by some examples with actual machining. The results show that the 
method can effectively reduce the error of the scallop height for subdivision surface and obtain the better shape and 
quality. In addition, the computational complexity and is scalable and robust.

1. Introduction 
Free-form surface design and manufacturing are important steps in product developments for free-form 
surface. Current CAD/CAM systems often defined objects by parametric surfaces, such as B-spline, Bezier, 
and NURBS representations. When the gouge free tool-path is calculated, these models are not ideal because 
the surface is not smooth. For example, when a surface is composed with multi-patches it can cause gaps 
especially when the model is complex. In order to solve this problem it needs splicing and trimming which are

not only time-consuming but also expensive[1]. The model is so bad so we can not generate NC data, because 
the machining quality may be affected. 
Recently, subdivision schemes are becoming common in the field of geometric modelling because it can 
use simple patch to represent multi-surface. At the same time, it also combines the parametric surfaces and 
polygon mesh. These properties make subdivision surfaces become the best choice when the model for design 
and manufacturing needs to be unified. So far there are some studies are focused on 3-axis machining 
subdivision surfaces. Joe Kurgano etc. first prove that subdivision surfaces can be applied to CAM [2]. Later, 
the algorithm of tool-path generation based on Loop subdivision is discussed [3]. In this research we choose 
Catmull-Clark subdivision surface [4] as our target subdivision surface because of Catmull-Clark surface 
quadrilateral-based advantages symmetry objects than the triangular mesh in the expression.   
The method of model building is discussed in section 2. The algorithm of the multi-axis tool path 
generation is investigated in section 3. The implementation and machining results are demonstrated in 
section4. Finally we discussed the conclusions. 
2. Model Building  
2.1. Interval of slicing plane 
From Fig.1.(a),we can see the parameter
w
d which describes the distance between the two adjacent paths. 
In addition, the parameter is depends on the tool radius r and cusp height error h . By using the radius of  
curvature of the are
to approximate the surface in the middle of two adjacent tool-paths, the surface 
step-over
w

Because of the complexity of calculating of

A constant interval of slicing plane will result in a high degree of value of cusp height error and surface 
step-over. In this section, the deformed method of triangle mesh is discussed in Ref [6] is extended to 
subdivision surface. 
2.2. Approximate of surface deformation 
Set the two mutually perpendicular axes, one of them as x -axis and perpendicular to the slicing plane, and 
the other as y -axis. The interval dx and dy are set on a horizontal grid xy -plane. The Z value for each offset 
vertex [ , ]
v p q is defined [ , ]
z p q , therefore, the slope angle

Based on Eq.(5), the parameter
is related to some parameters, such as the tool radius, the slope angle and 
the normal curvature. Therefore, the deformation ratio for
i

relationship between them.

Assuming the tool-path direction is parallel to the y -axis, we may calculated the deformed coefficient based 
on  Eq.(7). In multi-axis NC machining the share deformation should be considered. The share angle can be 
computed in Eq.(8).

The calculation method of

Set the slicing plane which is parallel to yz -plane intersects with deformed offset surface. At the same time, 
the tool-path is generated on the equidistant surface deformation space and the tool-path in parallel to yz -
plane. After an inverse deformation, the tool-path can be changed to the original space. Set

3.2. Calculation for tool axis normal vector 
The mean area method is adopted to calculate the normal vector of CL points. The method is based on the 
coordinates of CL points looking for special triangle which the distance to CL point is less than
, where
is 
the threshold. Each triangle facet area times their unit normal and cumulative summation, the results 
are divided by the area of triangular facets and thus the normal vector of CL points. Base on Fig.3., 
assuming there are m triangle facet which the distance to the point
CL
P is less than
, than we calculate 
the normal vector
ln  and area

obtained as follows:

Based on the above analysis and calculation, we can get the tool-path of the original space. 
4. Examples 
All proposed algorithm has been validated in the development of the prototype system which based on the 
OpenGL library and C++ language. In addition, some actual machining parts are accomplished to verified the 
algorithm. A model for a bicycle seat which the size is
3
17.67 11.02
4.23mm is designed with a 0.005mm 
allowance between the subdivision mesh and the limit surface. We subdivide the initial mesh one time to get 
the subdivision mesh. Fig.4.a shows the initial mesh. Move vertices along the corresponding vertex normal 
vector direction resulting offset surface, where the moving distance is the tool radius. The iso-plane tool path 
is accomplished based on the offset surface and the slicing plane parallel to each other. Fig.4.b shows the 
deformed CL surface. Fig.4.c described the deuced tool-path which located in deformed space. Fig.4.e shows 
the actual machining parts on our machining center. 
5. Conclusions 
In multi-axis machining a new approach constant scallop method is proposed and implemented. The 
experiments prove that the algorithm in a steep area pass spacing becomes smaller, the tool-path variable 
density. The method can effectively control the machining accuracy. The method of Catmull-Clark 
subdivision surface may be extended to other surfaces clearly. This paper described the subdivision surface

method of multi-axis machining. In fact, some technical problems, such as interference, collision, changing of 
tool-axis vector and cutter tracks discontinuous are still exist. So the multi-axis machining tool-path 
generation algorithm remains to be further explored for subdivision surface.
