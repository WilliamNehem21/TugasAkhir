In this work, we propose a 3-tiered architecture running the Linux, Apache/Nginx, MariaDB and PHP (LAMP) 
stack on a 64-bit Operating System (OS) and a Solid-State Disk inside a Raspberry Pi (RPI) for performance 
evaluation. The relative response time and Application Performance Index (Apdex) for a 32-bit OS were 
measured and compared against an increasing load with Moodle as the application. Our choice of Moodle as a 
testbed is influenced by, amongst others, the 3-tiered LAMP architecture of MoodleBox as an image for the RPI, 
the relatively large database underlying Moodle (with more than 200 relational tables), the convenience offered 
by its sample tests courses and test plans in developing performance tests. Moodle can be easily substituted from 
the environment to create portable LAMP-based applications. The relative response time improved by 11.9 s for a 
medium-sized course with 100 users with the upgrades. The Apdex showed that the CPU of the RPI was the 
limiting factor that prevented the web application from scaling to beyond 40 users for medium-sized courses. 
This work’s methodology, tests, and findings are important to administrators, educators, and users in general 
involved in capacity planning for the use of portable applications running under the LAMP stack. A ready for use 
image of the portable 64-bit LAMP stack is available for download. For a video summary of this paper, please

1. Introduction 
In this paper, we aim to improve the performance of a portable 
Raspberry Pi (RPI) [1,2] 3-tiered architecture running the LAMP stack 
by taking advantage of the availability of (1) a 64-bit Operating System 
and (2) a Solid-State Disk (SSD). The LAMP stack [3], which initially 
stood for Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP (LAMP), represented software 
for the 3-tiered architecture and the Operating System (OS). The 3-tiers 
is a type of architecture consisting of three tiers, or layers, designed to 
modularise different aspects of logical computing to facilitate updating 
any specific part of an application independently of the rest. The LAMP 
stack is one of the most widely used server architectures [4–6], and its 
usage with RPI opened new possibilities that previously did not exist. An 
excellent application use case is MoodleBox, used in the Penitentiary 
Centre of Caen [7]; it enabled incarcerated students to benefit from a 
digital environment to follow courses at the University of Caen in Nor-
mandy. The MoodleBox project inspires the creation of other portable 
web applications by replacing the Moodle [8] present in the 3-tiered 
architecture with other available LAMP stack applications. The LAMP 
stack of RPI gives rise to the portability of existing web applications. For 
capacity planning purposes, it is essential to know how many users such 
a portable system can support and the user experience in terms of the 
Application performance index (Apdex) [9,10]. This work also aims to 
present a simple method that can be applied to test the performance of 
3-tiered LAMP architecture through Moodle as an application testbed. 
The MoodleBox project [11] primary offering is a disk image trans-
ferred to an SD Card to boot an RPI. MoodleBox converts the Wi-Fi of the 
RPI into a portable hotspot and makes available via wireless Local Area 
Network (WLAN) a Moodle through a LAMP stack. Within Moodle 
administration area from MoodleBox, Moodle requests administrators to 
upgrade the OS and PHP versions to 64-bit for future compatibility, as 
displayed in Table 1. In other words, the system is itself requesting ad-
ministrators to upgrade the OS. 
MoodleBox uses the official OS from the company designing the RPI, 
which is Pi OS, a 32-bit Debian-based kernel [12]. Pi OS has a 64-bit 
version, which is still experimental and is a work in progress. Ubuntu

Server for ARM [13] is another OS distribution available for RPI in 
64-bit. Some previous benchmarking done on RPI version 4 (RPI4) [14] 
showed that 64-bit OS could improve the system’s performance in spe-
cific areas [15–17]. The RPI was designed to boot and run its OS from a 
Secure Digital (SD) Card. SD Cards are slower than Solid-State Disks 
(SSD), impacting performance. As of October 2020, RPI4 did not 
natively support booting from USB 3.0 or a faster disk like an SSD. Some 
known hacks could force the RPI to operate the OS from an SSD [18]. 
The official MoodleBox website estimates a maximum number of users 
to be between 20 and 30 [19] when it runs on a 32-bit OS, Wi-Fi and 
from an SD Card. 
Given the relatively sizeable relational database underlying Moo-
dle, the convenience offered by its sample test courses and test plans in 
developing performance tests, Moodle influenced our choice for a 
testbed application for performance evaluation of a 3-tiered LAMP 
stack. There are some previous performance tests done with Moodle on 
RPI. Henriette [20] measured a maximum of 20 possible connections 
with MoodleBox when tested with Apache JMeter [21]. Unfortunately, 
the detailed results for the tests were not published. Using a similar 
performance evaluation, Basuki et al. [22] observed that 30 users could 
be handled by a Pi-Box running Moodle with a score of 0.414 on Apdex. 
However, when rated, this score is considered an unacceptable user 
experience. MoodleBox was also reviewed as a platform for mobile 
learning by Mustapha & Said [23] to solve Learning Management 
System (LMS) problems related to internet coverage in parts of 
Morocco. The mobile learning platform included a maximum of 30 
trainees to participate simultaneously. The three previously cited 
works were carried out on an older version of Raspberry Pi, the version 
3 (RPI3). 
In a load testing experiment conducted by Manchanda [24], seven 
optimisation techniques were used to improve the user response time 
for web applications through Moodle on a Quad 2.9 GHz processor 
computer. In one test, 50 concurrent users were accessing Moodle 
from a hard disk for which a throughput of 7.8 requests per minute 
was observed while the average response time was 364.48 s. When an 
SSD was employed for the LAMP stack, the average response time 
drastically reduced to 5.27 s, but there was no indication of the 
throughput. 
The University of Merce Buana [25] implemented a load balancing 
clustering (LBC) to overcome performance issues to serve more than 
30,000 users in total and up to 1371 users/minute. The Apache ab 
benchmarking tool [26] was used to perform load testing. As part of 
the Apache ab benchmarking results for the LBC Design & Imple-
mentation, around 6–7 requests/second were to be served by one 
single server or a throughput of 420 users/minute. The two previous 
works indicated the throughput expected from a dedicated server 
under load tests. 
In this work, we built a 3-tiered LAMP stack on a 64-bit version of 
Ubuntu while maintaining the same environment as MoodleBox and 
labelled it as RPI64Box for comparative purposes. MoodleBox and 
RPI64Box were run from SD card and SSD to measure performance 
differences. To our knowledge, this work is the first port of MoodleBox 
to a 64-bit Ubuntu version of Linux. 
The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 details the setup, test 
environment, the dataset used for the 3-tiered architecture, and the 
application used as a testbed. We present the test in section 3. Section 
3.1 presents the Disk I/O performance; section 3.2 presents the System 
Benchmark for the 3-tiered architecture; section 3.3 presents the Apdex 
rating for performance tests and section 3.4 the server’s Resource Usage 
under load. The results for the previous tests are presented in section 4. 
The conclusion is proposed in section 5. 
2. Materials and methods 
2.1. The setup 
Two RPI4 with 4 GB of memory were used in the experiments. The 
RPIs were operated at a clock speed of 1.5 GHz when not overclocked. 
Both RPIs were powered with USB adapters capable of providing above 
3.1A, and CPU fans were installed to keep the temperature below 60◦
Celsius. The first RPI4 was set as the Web, Application and Database 
server, and the other acted as the client sending page requests to the 
server. The server was configured to provide a Wi-Fi access point, and 
the client connected through the Wi-Fi access point, creating a WLAN, as 
shown in Fig. 1. 
The software and hardware environment of the RPI4 with the access 
point in Fig. 1 were varied with a combination of 32-bit and 64-bit OS. 
The other variation was faster disk access through the use of SSD instead 
of SD card. A 32-GB SanDisk SD and a 128 GB SanDisk SSD Plus were 
used for all tests. The OS and disk storage variation produced four 
combinations labelled as 32SD, 32SSD, 64SD and 64SSD to represent the 
differences. The SSD versions were later overclocked to 2 GHz, and ’-OV’ 
was added to the label. 
For the 32-bit OS, a version of MoodleBox 3.9 containing Moodle 
version 3.10 running on Raspberry Pi OS (32-bit) was used. For the 64- 
bit OS, a Ubuntu 20.04.1 running Moodle with the same configuration 
was created by porting the MoodleBox ansible script to Ubuntu-64 [27]. 
The four environments were named: p32SD, p32SSD, u64SD and 
u64SSD. The first two used MoodleBox. The u64SD and u64SSD used 
RPI64Box, which represents a significant contribution to this work. A 
short video depicting the setup, environment and tests is available at 
https://rpi64box.com [28]. 
2.2. Test environment 
All four environments contained identical versions of Nginx, 
MariaDB and PHP on the servers. On Ubuntu, PHP version 7.3 was not 
available, and the closest and most recent update representing version 
7.4 was used. All other parameters were kept the same. 
Given that many variables can affect the overall software perfor-
mance of the servers, the same were maintained constant across the 
tests. The values are listed under Code snippet 1 and Code snippet 2. 
For PHP, the php-fpm library was used and the variables were 
maintained to their MoodleBox original values as shown in Code snippet 
1. The values represent a maximum of 5 server requests per unit time for 
PHP. This value is closely linked to the throughput of the server. 
For MariaDB, enabling the query cache of the database is recom-
mended by Moodle. The database variables were adjusted in/etc/mysql/

my.cnf as per Code snippet 2. 
The innodb_log_file_size (Code snippet 2) was maintained to 64 M 
across to compare the results of a standard MoodleBox with the 
RPI64Box. This value can be further increased to take advantage of 
available RAM. 
The filesystem table of Linux was also modified to create 64 MB 
temporary filesystem caches for/var/cache/moodle and/var/www/ 
moodledata/temp folders. A 16 MB cache for sessions was also created 
in/var/www/moodledata/sessions. The modifications were added to/ 
etc/fstab as tmpfs, which made use of available RAM to create the 
caches. 
2.3. Dataset 
Test courses were built in Moodle, and test plans that added different 
users to the test courses were built. This section describes the test 
courses and test plans used. 
Moodle standard test courses were built using Moodle’s test script, 
and three sizes were created as per Table 2. 
Moodle JMeter test plans were created using the JMeter test plan 
generator in Moodle. Test plans were created for extra small (xs), small 
(s) and medium (m) class sizes:  
• Extra small uses a maximum of 10 concurrent users with a ramp-up 
of a period of 1;  
• Small uses a maximum of 30 concurrent users with a ramp-up of a 
period of 6;  
• Medium uses a maximum of 100 concurrent users with a ramp-up of 
a period of 40. 
The test plans were created for the courses in Table 2 with a 
maximum number of concurrent users as displayed in Table 3. Each test 
was provided with a unique test plan label. 
The m3 – m9 test plan labels of Table 3 represent test plans for m3, 
m4, m5, m6, m7, m8 and m9, where the users were incremented by 10 
for each test. 
3. Tests 
In order to evaluate the performance of the RPI4, four distinct tests 
were carried out, namely a device storage performance test, a compre-
hensive performance test of the LAMP stack, an evaluation of the overall 
response time of generated pages and a monitoring of the server 
resource usages. All the tests are based on existing available scripts, as 
detailed in sections 3.1 to 3.4. 
3.1. Disk I/O performance test 
The disk I/O performance in terms of writing and reading speed can 
be measured from the Unix/Linux shell using HDParm, DD, FIO and 
IOZone commands. Furthermore, James Chambers came up with a 
benchmark script [18] which provides a unique score after executing the 
previous commands to indicate the performance of the storage media 
under test. The advantage of the benchmark is that it already has the 
vast majority of disk makes that were rated against the script, and their 
scores are listed online. This list makes the selection of storage media for 
an RPI4 easier, especially when planning ahead for performance 
improvements. 
3.2. System benchmark test 
The overall time it takes for a web server to respond to a query de-
pends on several factors, namely, the disk’s read and write performance, 
processor performance, processing speed for database queries, and 
network latency. One simple benchmarking approach would be to 
measure the execution time of these specific server areas. For example, 
the processor speed could be measured by counting the time it takes for a 
10 million loop to complete. The database performance could be eval-
uated by measuring the time to execute a specific Structured Query 
Language (SQL) operation. Moodle has a plugin called the System 
benchmark tool [29] which carries a similar performance check on 
various components of the 3-tier architecture. Although this method 
uses a simplistic approach to measure server performance, the System 
benchmark is ideal because of the different elements tested. The values 
are not definite measures representing the performance of a server but 
rather an indicative overview of performance in various areas. The

System benchmark’s output result is a score based on the average 
amount of time several scripts were executed; hence, a lower score is 
better. 
3.3. Apdex measurement 
Apdex measures the user’s satisfaction with the response time of the 
application. For instance, suppose a server is expected to respond within 
500 ms (ms) for a user to be satisfied, and the user’s frustration threshold 
is up to 1500 ms. In that case, this value can be expressed as a ratio of 
1:3. This ratio represents a user capable of waiting only three times 
longer than expected. 
To generate an application index, the response time for a satisfied 
user is required, from which a frustration time can be calculated. A ratio 
of 1:3, 1:4 and 1:5 between the two thresholds of satisfied and frustrated 
user response time is often used [9]. This work uses a threshold ratio of 
1:3 to maintain high exigencies from the RPI4. 
Apdex is defined as the number of satisfied samples plus half of the 
tolerating samples divided by all the samples. Apdex is calculated as 
below, where Time represents the Target Time for a satisfied user. 
ApdexTime = Satisfied samples + Tolerating samples/2
Total samples 
The Apdex results range from 0 to 1, where 1 is considered the best 
and 0 the worst-performing [9,10,30]. 
The Apdex values are also rated to represent the application 
responsiveness. Table 4 [30] shows how the Apdex range is mapped into 
a user experience rating labelled as Apdex Rating. 
The generated JMeter test scripts by Moodle, as mentioned in 2.3, 
already include Apdex values in their reports. Apart from Apdex, it is 
also possible to compare the average response time of the pages. 
3.4. Resource usage monitoring 
In order to plan ahead for any optimisation of the 3-tiered archi-
tecture, it is important to know which hardware resource is in scarcity. 
While it is feasible to directly collect these values when the tests are 
executed inside JMeter through the PerfMon plugin [31], the output for 
some hardware resources is simply a numeric value. Converting the 
values into a percentage usage produces more meaningful real-time 
information. Consequently, in order to convert the values into per-
centages, the maximum limit that each measurement can reach is 
required and was obtained as follows:  
• The total RAM values were acquired from the Linux shell ‘Free’ 
command.  
• The disk activity values were collected from ‘iostat %util’ command 
[32]. This represents the CPU time during which I/O requests were 
issued values close to 100%, indicating device saturation. It is worth 
noting that the percentage of disk utilisation from iostats tries to 
calculate the average close to the nearest second. At times minor 
delays in computing provide results of more or less than 1 s, leading 
to a percentage higher than 100%, which can be safely rounded to 
100% [33,34].  
• Iperf3 [35] measurements provided 57.0 Mbps as the maximum 
transmission rate for the wireless network. Periodically, the 
transmission rate would exceed the 57.0 Mbps threshold and be 
represented on graphs to exceed 100%. 
After converting the CPU, RAM, Network transmission and disk read 
values into percentages; these values were monitored and plotted. 
4. Results 
The results of the previously mentioned tests are displayed in sec-
tions 4.1 to 4.4; where appropriate, graphs or bar charts are also 
available. 
4.1. Disk I/O performance results 
The results as provided by the James Chambers script [18] repre-
senting the different disk transfer speeds in MB/s under the different OS 
environments and a James Chambers score were noted in Table 5. 
The SSD environments were found to be at least 3.4 times better in 
terms of the score when compared to their SD card equivalent, as dis-
played in the last row of Table 5. 
4.2. System benchmark results 
The results obtained from the Moodle System benchmark tool 
running for the different OS environments are displayed in Table 6. 
The results represent the time in seconds to execute each of the 
described tests and the acceptable limit and critical limit by which a 
script should be executed. The last two rows contain an average time in 
seconds it takes for all the scripts to run and a score for comparative 
purposes as provided by the benchmark tool. 
From Table 6, when comparing the impact of the storage media, SSD 
constantly improved the system’s performance. For the 32-bit OS 
(p32SD vs p32SSD), the score improved by 7 points or by 0.077s and for 
the 64-bit OS (u64SD vs u64SSD), the improvement was by 11 points or 
0.11s. 
The main areas where the SSD improved the overall system are 
‘Writing course performance – Speed of Database’ and ‘Login time per-
formance for guest/fake account’. The values were graphed in Fig. 2, 
and it can be observed that the response time for the Speed of Database 
improved by at least 1.6 times with SSD. 
The most impacted areas by the OS bit depth were graphed in Fig. 3. 
The ‘processor processing speed’ significantly improved from 0.361 
to 0.187, representing a gain of 1.9 times when moving to 64-bit. In 
contrast, it was observed that the ‘reading and writing file performance – 
Temporary Folders’ took longer. 
Finally, only moving to 64-bit did not improve the overall Bench-
mark score. The p32SD score is better than the u64SD (Table 6).

their throughput settings capped to 180 requests/minute. The Apdex 
and response time available from the tests are published in Table 7 and 
Table 8. Apdex values below 0.500 are considered unacceptable as per 
the Apdex rating. 
Initially, the four server environments were evaluated: p32SD, 
p32SSD, u64SD and u64SSD. The Apdex rating was unacceptable for 
p32SD, u64SD and p32SSD when 40 or more concurrent users were 
online, as shown by m4 in Table 7. However, the u64SD Apdex rating 
was 0.494, representing a score close to moving out of the unacceptable 
range. On the other hand, the 64-bit OS and the SSD allowed the u64SSD 
to move out of unacceptable range for m4. 
The outcome of the resource usage monitoring exercise of section 3.4 
provided insightful graphs [28] showing that the CPU usage was grad-
ually reaching close to 100% for more extended periods for tests m4 and 
onwards. To further evaluate if the RPI4 with an SSD upgrade could 
perform better with a more powerful processor, the CPU was over-
clocked to 2.0 GHz. The two resulting environments for the overclocking 
were labelled as p32SSD-OV and u64SSD-OV, as shown in Table 7. The 
overclocked versions of the environment, when operated with SSD, 
made it possible for the test environment to score more than 0.5 on the 
Apdex rating and confirmed that CPU access was scarce. 
In order to filter out all the test results for the environments below 
the acceptable mention per Apdex rating, Table 7 was graphed for Apdex 
values above 0.5 and displayed in Fig. 4. The resulting graph (Fig. 4) 
represents only test environments, the size of courses, and the number of 
concurrent users that an RPI4 can withstand as per the Apdex rating. The 
RPI4 can support between 50 and 100 users for medium-sized courses 
with CPU overclocking. However, the quality of the Apdex rating will be 
poor. 
The size of a course in Moodle impacts the server’s ability to support 
many concurrent users. MoodleBox, which runs a 32-bit Pi OS, is 
appropriately optimised to use the RPI hardware to its full potential. The 
stated number of users supported by MoodleBox being 20–30 is appro-
priately justified. RPI64Box on SD card (u64SD) helps improve course 
Apdex value for course sizes below 30 users or if the CPU usage is not 
saturated. 
Another way to compare the results of the JMeter tests apart from 
Apdex is to go through the average response times of the tests carried 
out. The response time in seconds for the different tests and environ-
ments is displayed in Table 8. 
When comparing the original MoodleBox, which runs on an SD card 
(p32SD), to an RPI64Box on an SSD with CPU overclocking (u64SSD- 
OV), the response time did improve by a range of 0.1s–11.9s (Table 8). 
The average response times of the pages were placed on a bar chart, as 
shown in Fig. 5, to make visible the time difference. 
Overall, RPI64Box improves the average response time for medium 
course sizes but does not significantly support more users as the scarce 
resource is the CPU itself. Overclocking is an excellent option to get the

maximum out of an RPI for medium-sized courses with more than 30 
users. 
4.4. Resource usage 
The results from the resource usage monitoring process for the CPU, 
RAM, network transmission and disk read were plotted as a percentage 
against time for each test resulting in 66 charts. Omitted here, these 
charts can be consulted as supplementary online materials, together 
with the detailed JMeter HTML reports [28]. These charts are accessible 
on rpi64box.com [28], where a table similar to Table 7 is published with 
individual report links on each cell as additional information. Each link 
leads to a JMeter HTML report for the specific test. From each JMeter 
HTML report, the resource usage for each test can be accessed under the 
following navigation menu, Custom graphs → Over Time → Resource 
Usage & Temperature of System. From these graphs, it was observed that 
the reduction in CPU and RAM Usage percentage coincided with an 
increase in Apdex value. 
The resource usage values of the previously mentioned charts were 
averaged to obtain a single value for each test and plotted to identify 
resource consumption trends. The average CPU usage for the different 
test plans from ss to mm is shown in Fig. 6. 
When the bit depth of OS was compared, 64-bit OS provided a gain of 
CPU usage between 1.3 and 4.8%. For disk storage, the use of SSD frees 
the CPU by a range of 0.2–6.6%. The 64-bit OS, SSD, and CPU over-
clocking reduce CPU usage by 9.6–18.1% for the 3-tier architecture. 
The Average RAM usage for the test plans from ss to mm is shown in 
Fig. 7. 
In terms of volatile memory usage, it can be observed from Fig. 7 that 
the u64SD consumes 15.1–17.4% more RAM than p32SD, and the 
u64SSD consumes 13.1–15.9% more RAM than the p32SSD. It is 
observed that the overclocked version of Ubuntu 64 on an SSD (u64SSD- 
OV) consumes 10.8–15% of RAM less than a Pi OS 32-bit on an SD card 
(p32SD). 
The average resource usage graphs present in Figs. 6 and 7 provide 
an insight into how the resources are being used. However, they do not 
portray the actual situation at specific points in time for resource usage. 
When executed, the tests contain a ramp-up period during which the 
number of concurrent users is gradually increased or decreased. These 
variations affect the average resource usage. For this reason, the 
maximum CPU usage of Fig. 6 never reaches 100%. 
Though it required some extra steps to be converted into a percent-
age and plotted as a graph, the real-time resource usage graphs of the 
tests provided additional insight into the resource usage that would not 
have been visible only with the average of the resource usage values. For 
instance, the graphs which are available as supplementary materials 
showed that the CPU usage peaked close to 100% for a subsequent 
amount of time for some test plans. 
5. Conclusion 
Even though the Apdex improved marginally when comparing a 32- 
bit OS environment against a 64-bit one, it remains the way forward due 
to the limitation of the 32-bit OS to use a maximum of 3 GB of RAM for a 
process and that RPIs are available now with more than 4 GB of RAM. 
The usage of SSDs did further improve the Apdex rating marginally. 
Given that different disk storage speeds are available on the market, the 
results depend on the SSD speed used. The SSDs used for the tests were at 
least 3.4 times better than the SD card per the James Chambers 
benchmark. This benchmark is helpful as it compares and publishes the 
score for different disks available on the market. Faster SSDs than those 
used in previous tests may yield a better performance gain and require 
further tests. The system benchmark tool, a simplistic benchmark to

compare the 3-tiered LAMP environments, showed that 32-bit and 64-bit 
OS on SSDs had the same performance score and outperformed the SD by 
less than 10% as score. 
The resource usage graphs of Figs. 6 and 7 showed that the average 
CPU consumption was 1.3–4.8% lower in 64-bit OS but used between 
13.1 and 17.4% more RAM on average. During the JMeter tests, for 
medium-sized courses, which contain quite some content, as displayed 
in Table 2, the real-time CPU usage peaked for extended periods when 
more than 40 users were connected, which affected the Apdex rating. 
The Apdex for m4 on u64SSD is 0.537, which is considered poor but 
acceptable. The Apdex rating indicates that a portable 3-tiered LAMP 
stack on a Pi can support 40 simultaneous users expecting a response 
from the server within 1.5 s. With CPU overclocking to 2Ghz, up to 100 
users could be supported by the portable RPI with an acceptable but 
poor Apdex rating as per Table 7. CPU overclocking also reduced the 
average percentage of RAM usage, which was initially above 60% for 
u64SD and less than 41% for the overclocked u64SSD-OV, as shown in 
Fig. 7. 
In terms of capacity planning, if less than 30 users were to be sup-
ported by a portable RPI or the RPI has a maximum of 2 GB of memory, 
there is no real need to move to the u64SSD as the Average CPU usage is 
less than 60% and average RAM usage is less than 50% on p32SD. This is 
reassuring for MoodleBox users. Overclocking should be considered first 
to support more users, followed by SSD and 64-bit OS. In the best sce-
nario, the CPU performance improved by 18.1% from 32-bit OS on SD 
card (p32SD) to 64-bit overclocked OS on SSD (u64SSD-OV). The rela-
tive response time improved by 11.9 s for a medium-sized course with 
100 users. 
The automated script for installing necessary software for creating 
the RPI64Box environment is based on MoodleBox and is available as an 
ansible script on GitHub [27]. The ready for use Disk image is also 
available for download online [28]. This is useful for users who want to 
be exempted from the manual process of setting up and configuring the 
LAMP stack on a Ubuntu 64-bit ARM OS to make it portable. 
Finally, the significance of the experiments is of multiple folds. (1) It 
provides real-world performance information of the RPI4 as a portable 
3-tiered web server, including the responses’ quality. (2) It shows that 
the choice of the OS can impact the overall throughput. (3) It provides 
insight into the use of faster disks through USB 3.0 Bus in the overall 
performance of the web server and a simple way to evaluate and 
compare storage devices. (4) The experiments pushing the RPI4 hard-
ware to its limits and CPU overclocking confirmed that the scarce 
resource is the CPU itself. This information provides a significant hint for 
future works related to performance improvement of 3-tiers for IoT 
Devices like RPI4; for example, optimising CPU intensive operations can 
further improve throughput and response times. (5) The whole web 
server environment is available as a disk image that can be transferred to 
a disk and booted from an RPI or similar IoT devices. The Disk image can 
be used as a benchmark to evaluate how other RPI alternatives like the 
RockPi 4 [36], Orange Pi 4 [37] and upcoming versions of RPI devices 
perform as a 3-tiered web server compared to the RPI4.
