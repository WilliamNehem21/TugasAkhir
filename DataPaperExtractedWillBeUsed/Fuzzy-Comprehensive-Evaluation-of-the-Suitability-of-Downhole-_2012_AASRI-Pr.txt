Abstract 
The downhole inflow control device (ICD) could control the production profile of every section in horizontal well and  the 
edge and bottom water coning, so it is important in enhancing oil and gas recovery. To quantitatively depict ICD’s 
suitability in horizontal wells requires analyzing reservoir parameters like permeability variation coefficient, average 
permeability, the ratio of vertical permeability to horizontal permeability and the technology parameters like tube string 
size, horizontal section length, segment number and the pressure loss ratio between ICD and reservoir. With fuzzy 
mathematical method, this work has analyzed these factors through relative subordinate function and established the fuzzy 
comprehensive evaluation model to study the suitability of ICD in sandstone reservoirs by the weight of each factor and 
fuzzy relationship matrix. The fuzzy evaluation and simulation results prove this method could well evaluate the 
suitability of ICD in sandstone reservoirs and it is significant for the application of ICD in horizontal well development.

As a new technique, the intelligent completion system is basic for intelligent oil field establishment. With 
its application, the downhole inflow control device (ICD) also becomes more prevalent. ICD in horizontal

wells can effectively slow down the water cone and gas cone, increase the sweep area of gas drive or water 
drive, promote single well productivity and then enhance oil recovery. The choke flow of ICD can control the 
flow in the downhole production layer and adjust the production profile to get the balancing development and 
optimized production of oil and gas. But many elements would affect the horizontal well productivity with 
ICD and to describe, analyze and evaluate them is hard because of their vagueness and uncertainty. Therefore 
this work introduces the fuzzy mathematical method, an evaluating method with theory of fuzzy set which 
integrates evaluating matrix and the objective fuzzy matrix. It could tell the quality of many factors 
objectively and make quantitative evaluation correctly. The key point in establishing optimized evaluation 
model with fuzzy mathematics is in determining the evaluating index factor, index weight, and subordinate 
function matrix affecting the suitability of ICD and then establishing the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation 
model.

2. Univariate analysis 
ICD limits the production of high permeability zone and balance the horizontal section inflow profile by 
generating an additional resistance between reservoir and pipe. The dominating factors influencing the 
301
 Quantang Fang et al. /  AASRI Procedia  3 ( 2012 )  299 – 306 
 
suitability of ICD can be summarized as in two parts: (1) the inflow part relating to reservoir properties, 
including reservoir heterogeneity, permeability, reservoir thickness and Kv/Kh; (2) the outflow part mainly 
relating to technology like tube string size, segment number, horizontal section length and PICD/ Preservoir 
(Birchenko et al., 2008).  
Further analyses (Shuai, 2012 ) indicate that: 
 The technological factors influencing ICD completion meet the following order, segment 
number > PICD/ Preservoir > horizontal section length >tube string diameter. The first two factors can 
significantly influence the experiment result while the latter two’s influences are relatively small. 
 The reservoir factors influencing ICD completion meet the following order, variation coefficient > average 
permeability > reservoir thickness > Kv/Kh . Also the first two factors can greatly influence the experiment 
and the latter two’s influences are small. Given the poor water control effect in thin layer bottom water 
reservoir, the thickness is not included in comprehensive evaluation.

3. Fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model 
3.1. Establishing factors set 
The factors are classified as follows: U= {reservoir parameters, technology parameters} is used as the 
second level of ICD completion suitability factor set. Reservoir parameter U1 = {permeability, permeability 
variation coeffient, Kv/Kh} and U2 ={horizontal section length, tube string diameter, PICD/ Preservoir, segment 
number} are the first level factor set. 
3.2. Establishing weight matrix of influencing factors 
The affecting factors are of different significance. The single factor subordinate function determined by 
subordinate function could only reflect the suitability of single factor and is still univariant analysis (Fang et 
al, 2010). Therefore, to present the importance of different factors, certain weights 
 are given to them as 
follows:

The analytic hierarchy process is used to determine the weight of first level parameters and subjective 
assignment method is used for the second level parameters.

The fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model for different cases of ICD completion is as follows:

(4) 
where, W is the weight matrix, R is the single factor fuzzy evaluation matrix of each influencing factor and V 
is the comprehensive evaluation matrix of factors influencing ICD application.  
3.4. Establishing subordinate function 
The subordinate function of the factors is the basic for comprehensive evaluation of ICD completion 
suitability. For convenience, the function adopted here is relative subordinate function as follows: 
wj
oj
wj
ij
ij
X
X
X
X
r
 
 
(5) 
where, Xij is the evaluation parameter number j in case i, Xoj is the correspondent parameter of the best 
suitability, Xwj is the correspondent parameter of the worst suitability and rij is the fitness of the evaluation 
parameter with respect to the optimal value. 
Xoj and Xwj are determined by univariant analysis of ICD completion suitability and the range of reservoir 
and technology parameters in China. The correspondent evaluation parameter rij can then be calculated by 
Equation (5).  
The relative fitness rij varies from 0 to 1 when comprehensively evaluating ICD suitability with different 
cases. The larger value of rij means the higher suitability of ICD completion. The matrix of all rij values is the 
fuzzy comprehensive suitability matrix of ICD completion R(x).

According to the sensitive analysis of different influencing factors, we can give relative importance order 
for each factor as shown in Table 1.

 Second level weight matrix  
Technology parameters in ICD completion are usually artificially set according to reservoir parameters and 
production requirements. Since it is controlled by people, its impact on ICD suitability is relatively small. The 
weight of reservoir parameters and technology parameters is obtained through expert experience and it is 
W2=(0.65, 0.35)T.   
4. Case Study 
A horizontal well is planned to develop a sandstone heterogeneous reservoir and intelligent completion is 
conducted. ICD is installed to control the fluids flowing into the wellbore. The evaluation parameters of 6 
cases are shown in Table 4.

The result suggests that case 2 is the best while case 3 is the worst just from the aspect of reservoir factors. 
The main reason is that case 2 has the largest variation coefficient, so the inflow profile is most unbalanced 
and the probability of water coning is the highest. In this case, ICD completion could display its best water 
control effect and is most suitable. From the aspect of technology, case 3 is the best while case 1 is the worst, 
because case 3 has the largest segment number. Combining the 2 factors together, we find case 2 is the best 
while case 5 is the worst. 
5. Conclusions 
 The univariate analysis of influence of the reservoir and wellbore parameters on the suitability of ICD 
could only get qualitative result. It could not reflect the interaction among various factors and is not 
appropriate to evaluate the suitability in real oil reservoirs. 
306

 Fuzzy mathematical comprehensive evaluation quantifies the interactions among the factors to get 
quantitative result. This is helpful in evaluating the suitability of ICD and choosing the development 
options in real oil reservoirs. 
 However, the limitation of this work might lie in the inadequate consideration of the interaction among 
those factors since the analyses here are based on the site conditions. The subordinate functions for each 
factor are determined when only considering the single factor. Therefore, the method might need further 
improvement in real applications.
