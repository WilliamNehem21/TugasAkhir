Abstract
Tuberculosis is a social, re-emerging infectious disease with medical implications
throughout the globe. Despite efforts, the coverage of tuberculosis disease (with HIV prevalence)
in Nigeria rose from 2.2% in 1991 to 22% in 2013 and the orthodox diagnosis methods available
for Tuberculosis diagnosis were been faced with a number of challenges which can, if measure not
taken, increase the spread rate; hence, there is a need for aid in diagnosis of the disease. This study
proposes a technique for intelligent diagnosis of TB using Genetic-Neuro-Fuzzy Inferential method
to provide a decision support platform that can assist medical practitioners in administering accu-
rate, timely, and cost effective diagnosis of Tuberculosis. Performance evaluation observed, using a
case study of 10 patients from St. Francis Catholic Hospital Okpara-In-Land (Delta State, Nigeria),
shows sensitivity and accuracy results of 60% and 70% respectively which are within the acceptable
range of predeﬁned by domain experts.

1. Introduction
Tuberculosis (TB) is a social, re-emerging infectious disease
that has medical implications throughout the globe [1]. The
largest single cause of adult illness and death from the commu-
nicable disease is caused by Mycobacterium Tuberculosis [2].
Nigeria has made great strides in increasing access to Directly
Observed Therapy Short-course (DOTS) for TB yet, coverage,
which was 45% in 1999, had reached 75% by 2005 while treat-
ment success for 2005 cohort was 75% [3]. Although TB inci-
dence in Nigeria is below the normal level for Sub-Saharan
Africa, but it remains high at a rate of 311 cases per 100 grand

population members in 2006. The trends for both Nigeria and
Sub-Saharan Africa, as depicted in Fig. 1, show a slight down-
ward turn of TB incidence since 2003. Still with 250 grand new
cases each year, a mortality rate of 81 deaths per 100,000 spells
the disease as high burden on Nigeria [4].
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated in 2006,
that each year, more than 8 million new cases of TB occur and
approximately 3 million persons die from the disease [4,5] and
estimated that between 19% and 43% of the world’s popula-
tion will be infected with Mycobacterium Tuberculosis. Within
the past decade it has become clear that the spread of HIV
infection and the immigration of persons from areas of high
incidence have resulted in increased numbers of TB cases. It
has always occurred disproportionately among disadvantaged
populations such as the homeless, malnourished, and over-
crowded [6]. Today, several methods for the diagnosis of TB
have been proposed. Tuberculin Test, Radiological Examina-
tion, and Sputum Smear Microscopy are common conven-
tional approaches however in the last 10 years, several
molecular methods have been developed for direct detection,
identiﬁcation and susceptibility testing of mycobacteria [7].
Orthodox methods of diagnosing TB are primarily through
physical
examination
and
laboratory
tests.
The
former
involves asking patients certain questions for prognosis pur-
poses while tests are carried out to afﬁrm physical examina-
tion. Diagnosis can be stopped if medical practitioner is
totally convinced after physical examination however, this is
not advised. This orthodox method is currently faced with a
number of challenges such as lack of medical facilities in most
medical centers and as a result, inhibiting the management of
TB in developing countries.
The strength of IT in providing an effective and efﬁcient
solution to real life problems has been explored to aid scientiﬁc
discoveries and advancement of different ﬁelds of medicine [8].
Hence, to reduce the morbidity and mortality rates in human
as a result of TB, there is need to incorporate IT into its diag-
nostic approach. This study, therefore, proposes a decision
support model for intelligent diagnosis of TB using Genetic-
Neuro-Fuzzy Inferential technique. The model is aimed at pro-
viding a decision support platform that can aid medical prac-
titioners in administering accurate, timely, and cost effective
diagnosis of TB in developing countries.
2. Literature review
This section presents a review of literature on the concept of
Expert System (ES). Description of major tools for building
such adaptive systems including is briefed while review of
hybrid and decision support systems is also presented.
2.1. Artiﬁcial intelligence
Research on Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) in the last two decades
has greatly improved performance of both manufacturing and
service systems [9]. AI, ﬁrst coined by John McCarthy in the
ﬁfties is concerned with the ‘hows’ and the ‘whys’ of human
intelligence; however, it has become an important area of
research in virtually all ﬁelds including engineering, science
and education, and as well as its applications in accounting,
marketing, stock market and law, among others [10,11].
AI is the intelligence deployed by machines to handle com-
plex imprecise tasks that require intelligence if done by
humans. The central problems of AI include reasoning, pro-
gramming, artiﬁcial life, belief revision, knowledge representa-
tion, machine learning, natural language understanding, and
theory of computation [12,13,38]. It achieved greater feats in
practical application despite, some setbacks, its success is being
revived with the commercial success of ES [39]. Fuzzy Logic,
Neural Networks, and Genetic Algorithms, are such tech-
niques used in modeling intelligence.
2.2. Expert systems
Expert Systems (ESs) is a branch of AI that employs the use of
human knowledge to solve problems that require human’s
expertise and it helps to solve complex problems by reasoning
about knowledge rather than following developers’ procedures
as in the case of conventional programming [14]. ES continues
to evolve for speciﬁc applications in medical diagnosis due to
inﬂux of new and massive information that requires experts
to be specialized.
The basic steps in ES development have been reported in
[15]. Many AI systems have been developed for the purpose
of enhancing healthcare delivery, providing better healthcare
facilities, and reducing the cost associated with quality health-
care services. Early studies in intelligent systems have been
shown to outperform manual practices of medical diagnosis.
Examples of such systems are as follows: INTERNIST, a
rule-based expert system for the diagnosis of complex prob-
lems in general internal medicine; MYCIN, a rule-based expert
system to diagnose and recommend treatment for certain
blood infections; CASNET, an expert system for the diagnosis
and treatment of glaucoma, EXPERT, an extension general-
ization of the CASNET formalism which was used in creating
consultation systems in rheumatology and endocrinology [16].
2.3. Soft computing tools
The intervention of soft computing tools (techniques) in med-
ical analysis has greatly reduced the cost of human support
and medical diagnosis, with increase in accuracy of diagnosis
results. Fuzzy Logic, Neural Networks, and Genetic Algo-
rithm are common tools adopted in developing ESs [17].
2.3.1. Fuzzy logic
Fuzzy Logic (FL) is one of AI techniques that deals with
uncertainty in knowledge and simulates human reasoning in
an incomplete or fuzzy data. FL is deﬁned as a nonlinear map-
Figure 1
Incidence of TB in Nigeria and other Sub-Saharan
African countries [39].

ping of an input data set to a scalar output data set, basically it
is aimed at providing approximate reasoning. This technique
has attracted growing attention and interest in modern IT, pat-
tern recognition, and decision making among others [18]. FL
theory provides a mathematical strength to capture uncertain-
ties associated with human cognitive processes, such as think-
ing and reasoning. It is a suitable and applicable basis for
developing knowledge-based systems in varying sectors of life
such as health. It has been applied to interpret sets of medical
ﬁndings; syndrome differentiation in eastern medicine and
diagnosis of diseases in western medicine; and for real-time
monitoring of patient data [19].
In fuzzy set theory, linguistic terms are used to illustrate the
correlation of Membership Function (MF) which describes the
membership of an element within the base of a fuzzy set. Each
element has a unit value that characterizes the grade of mem-
bership of a set and such element can simultaneously belong to
another set, possibly, at varying degrees. Ref. [20] emphasize
that a number of different types of MFs have been proposed
for fuzzy control systems though [21] concluded triangular
and trapezoidal MFs as the mostly used. Triangular MF is a
particular case of MF that is speciﬁed by three parameters
(a, b, c) and shows the degree of membership of each class
of a linguistic term as possibility distribution [22]. Fig. 2a rep-
resents a typical Triangular MF of input and output variables
while Fig. 2b uses four parameters to describe the membership
of an element in a fuzzy set using Trapezoidal MF.
The trapezoidal MF of a fuzzy set F with each element hav-
ing tolerance interval [a,b], left width a and right width b is
determined using Eq. (1). If notation F = (a, b, a, b) is used,
then ½F�c ¼ ½a � ð1 � cÞa; b þ ð1 � cÞb�, Vce½0; 1� hence the sup-
port of A is (a �a, b +b).
FðxÞ ¼
1 � ða � xÞ=a
if a � a 6 x 6 a

if a 6 x 6 b
1 � ðx � bÞ=b
if a 6 x 6 b þ b
0
otherwise

In fuzzy set, an element can belong to both its set and its
compliment set or to neither of them. This principle preserves
the structure of the logic and avoids the contradiction of ele-
ment. However, fuzzy logic is highly abstract and employs
heuristic requiring human experts to discover rules about data
relationship [19]. FL has been widely adopted in developing
ESs for health management. For instance, [18] proposed model
ES for typhoid fever, while [23] for malaria diagnosis, and
lastly, [24] developed a diagnostic ES for cardiovascular dis-
eases. In [19], the use of Fuzzy Cluster Means was applied to
diagnose HIV/AIDS shortly after [25] proposed the use of
fuzzy sets for diagnosing low back pain in computer users.
2.3.2. Neural network
Neural Network (NN) is a group of interconnected artiﬁcial
neurons that mimic the properties of biological neurons. It fol-
lows analog and parallel computing system made up of simple
processing elements that communicate through a rich set of
interconnections with varying contributory weights. Artiﬁcial
Neural Network (ANN), is synthetic nervous systems loosely
inspired to simulate functions of human brain [26]. ANN
attempts to abstract the complexity of biological nervous sys-
tem so as to focus on what may hypothetically matter most
from an information processing point of view.
Medicine has always beneﬁted from forefront of technology
as it has boosted medicine to extraordinary levels of achieve-
ment. ANN has been successfully used in various areas of med-
icine such as biomedical analysis, imaging systems, and drug
development but extensively used in diagnosis to detect ail-
ments such as cancer and heart problems in human [27]. The
term network in ANN arises because of the function f(x)
deﬁned as a composition of other function gi(x) which are fur-
ther used as composition of more functions.
Fig. 3 shows a simple NN which comprises of three layers.
The ﬁgure comprises of input units connected to hidden units
which in turn is connected to a layer of ‘‘output” units. The
activity of the input unit represented the raw information that
is fed into the network; the activity of the hidden units is deter-
mined by the activity of the input units and the weights
between the hidden and output units. The hidden units are free
to construct their own representation of the input; the weights
between the input and hidden units determine when each hid-
den unit is active and so by modifying the weights, a hidden
unit can choose what it represents.
ANN employs learning paradigm that includes supervised,
unsupervised and reinforced learning. One good thing is it does
not require details on how to recognize disease but it has a self-
learning and self-tuning feature which helps it to attain that
[28]. Finally, it cannot handle linguistic information and vague
information.
2.3.3. Genetic algorithm
Genetic Algorithm (GA) is simply a search algorithm based on
the observation of sexual reproduction and principle of sur-
vival of the ﬁttest, which enables biological species to adapt
to their environment and compete effectively for resources.
GAs are search algorithms which use principles inspired by
natural genetics to evolve solutions to problems. The basic idea
is to maintain population of chromosomes that represents can-
didate solutions to a problem, and the candidate will evolve

over a period of time through competition and controlled
variation.
GAs have got a great measure of success in search and opti-
mization problems. While the algorithm is relatively straight
forward, it is an effective stochastic search method, proven
as a robust problem solving technique that produces better
than random results [29]. GAs are robust and powerful in dif-
ﬁcult situations where the space is usually large, discontinuous,
complex and poorly understood [30], it has been applied in a
wide range of problem areas, though it just guarantee ﬁnding
an acceptable solution in a quick and not a global optimum
solution to a problem.
2.3.4. Review of hybrid and decision support systems
A Decision Support System is an interactive computer-based
information system that utilizes database models to solve ill-
structured problems and come up with a valuable decision.
In the late 1980s, DSS was conﬁrmed to have assisted in man-
agerial positions using suitable available technologies to
improve effectiveness of academic and professional activities
[38] but over the years, it has migrated to an interactive system
that assists users in taking quick appropriate decisions in any
given context [31]. In a related study, Ref. [32] developed a
fuzzy expert system as a platform for diagnostic support for
hypertension management. The system is composed of four
major components for fuzzy processes while Root Sum Square
and Center of Gravity were employed as fuzzy inference and
defuzziﬁcation methods respectively. A case study of 30
patients with tuberculosis was used to validate the ES. [33]
combined NN, FL and Case Based Reasoning to model DSS
for diagnosis of depression disorders. The NNs were con-
structed to imitate intelligent human biological processes of
learning while FL provides a means for dealing with impreci-
sion, vagueness and uncertainties in the medical data and
CBR entails the use of past situations to solve new occur-
rences. Finally, this study proposes a Genetic-Neuro-Fuzzy
inferential technique for diagnosis of tuberculosis.
3. Proposed decision support system
This section presents design of the system’s architecture and
procedures performed by each component of the architecture
during diagnosis. Components of the architecture, as presented
in Fig. 5, are Knowledge Base, Genetic-Neuro-Fuzzy Inference
Engine, and Decision Support Engine.
3.1. Knowledge base
Knowledge base stores both static and dynamic interpreted
information about the decision variables involved in the diag-
nosis of TB. The component, comprising of the Database,
Fuzzy Logic, Neural Network, and Genetic Algorithm, serves
as a repository for operational data that are to be processed.
3.1.1. Database
Structured database presents quantitative data about facts and
the established rules in the ﬁeld of medicine focusing on diag-
nosis of TB. The facts comprise of signs and symptoms of TB,
while rules are patterns to draw deductions based on available
information [18]. Unstructured database is heuristic in nature
and hence gathered by experience, good practices, guesses,
and judgments [34]. The database comprises of Patient-Bio-
Data, Disease-Physical-Signs, Disease-Symptoms, Medical-
History, Physical Examination, results of diagnostic tests and
Patient Diagnosis.
3.1.2. Fuzzy logic
The diagnosis process harnesses the strength of fuzzy logic
component in the following operational sequence:
3.1.2.1. Fuzziﬁcation of input variables. Given a fuzzy set A,
deﬁned as Eq. (2), represents TB diagnosis variables with ele-
ment denoted by xi, the fuzziﬁcation process involves trans-
forming raw input value of each variable to a fuzzy term

ere] deﬁned over the variables. That is, such values are derived
from functions deﬁned to determine the degree of membership
of each variable in the fuzzy set.

where lAðxiÞ is the MF of xi in A using triangular MF while lA
is the degree of membership of xi in A. a, b and c are the
parameters of the MF governing its triangular shape and each
attribute is described with linguistic terms.
3.1.2.2. Establishment of fuzzy rule base. The rule base for TB
diagnosis is characterized by a set of IF–THEN rules in which
the antecedents (IF parts) and consequents (THEN parts)
involve linguistic variables. The rules can be formulated with
assistance of experts in the management of TB, or on consul-
tation to existing standard literature. A rule can only ﬁre if
any of its precedence parameters such as very mild, mild, mod-
erate, severe, and very severe evaluates to TRUE, otherwise it
does not ﬁre.
3.1.2.3. Fuzzy inference engine. This component controls the
decision making logic by applying suitable composition proce-
dure from rule base to values of variable inputs received. The
inference engine applies composition procedure on the inputs
to produce desired output, and Root Sum Square (RSS), is
applied to scale the functions at their respective magnitude
and computes a composite area. RSS is a method used to com-
bine the effects of ﬁred rules in order to draw relevant infer-
ence. It is computed with Eq. (4).
RSS ¼

Rk is a ﬁred rule where k81; . . . ; n is the Id of ﬁred rule
3.1.2.4. Defuzziﬁcation of output values. Defuzziﬁcation of out-
put values involves translating result from the inference engine
into crisp values which are, mostly, required by medical
experts for proper analysis and interpretation, this aids efﬁ-
cient diagnosis. This research employs Centroid of Area
(CoA) technique for its defuzziﬁcation. This interface receives
the output of inference engine as its input and ﬁnalizes compu-
tation by applying Eq. (5).
CoA ¼
Pn

where lYðxiÞ is degree of i in a membership function and xi is
the center value in function.
The computational simplicity and intuitive plausibility of
this approach gives rise to its adoption. For a complete medi-
cal evaluation of TB disease, the variables considered after
consultations with medical experts and other standard literal
sources are categorized as presented in Table 1.
3.1.3. Neural network
Neural Network has the capability of capturing domain
knowledge from available indicators and can readily handle
both continuous and discrete data. NN is used to train and test
the designed fuzzy system to optimize the performance of the
overall system. The NN component of Fig. 6 is made up of
variables from Physical Examination (PE), Medical History
(MH), Laboratory Investigation (LI), and Chest Radiology
(CR) of patients. Each diagnosis variable has a weight Wi
which shows its contribution in the diagnosis process.
The raw information obtained from patients is fed into NN
via input layer and participation of each category of variables
is determined at a hidden layer of the network using:
CATi ¼

Ai � WAi
ð6Þ
CATi is ith category of variable, n is count of variables in
CATi, and Ai is the ith diagnosis variable with weight WAi.

3.1.4. Genetic algorithm
Actually, NN provides a structure for combining the diagnos-
tic parameters which could serve as a platform for the infer-
ence engine, but a speciﬁc issue with NN is lack of deﬁnite
way of determining the connection weights for hidden layers
when dealing with a particular problem. A number of medical
diagnosis had been assisted by neuro-fuzzy systems though
such systems had been built based on trial and errors, this
increases computation cost. In this study, genetic optimization
is performed to choose optimal values from a group of diag-
nostic parameters which serve as input. Fig. 6 shows there
are 24 diagnostic parameters in the NN but the task is to
decide which parameters are taken as input in order to mini-
mize complexity.
An individual chromosome consists of 24 genes and each
gene represents the connection weight of a diagnosis variable
in a length of 1 bit. One feasible solution is to generate an ini-
tial population holding a set of possible solutions from ran-
dom chromosomes. A chromosome is represented as a vector
C = (CA, . . . , CX)
of
binary
decision
variables
Ci=0,2,3;
encoded in binary representation as string consisting {0,1}
genes. A gene Ci = 1 if the ith variable is included in a solution
set of a diagnostic process otherwise 0. Fitness function is used
to optimize each chromosome by evaluating the genes that
constitute the chromosome using their ﬁtness value.

As evolutionary algorithm continues through its cycle, ﬁt-
ness value of each chromosome keeps improving till it reaches
an optimum value when it can no longer improve. Fig. 7 shows
chromosomes of some candidates and their ﬁtness values. A
number of constraints have been considered in carrying out
appropriate management of disease in medical diagnosis,
therefore ﬁtness evaluation of chromosome must be done with
proper constraint validation. Constraints can be termed as
objectives that must be achieved in which some render most
of the solutions from the search space hence, its application
in GA is problem speciﬁc. Ordering constraint proposed in
[35] is adopted in this study. The ﬁtness evaluation of an indi-
vidual F(i) is done as:
Fi ¼
1 þ
X
n
i¼0
Wi � CiðpÞ
 
!�1
ð8Þ
where n is the number of diagnosis variables, Wi is the weight
associated with ith variable and CiðpÞ is the number of viola-
tions for ith constraint at solution p.
This ﬁtness function has a range of [0,1] and an optimal
solution
occurs
when
we
have
0
violations
thus
Pn
i¼0Wi � CiðpÞ which results in Fi ¼ 1. Chromosomes with
higher ﬁtness value are selected as parents for mating in order
to produce outstanding candidates and maximize the ﬁtness
function. The probability of choosing an individual for genetic
operation is proportional to its ﬁtness, that is, if the ﬁtness
value of an individual is Fi, then the probability, Pi, of choos-
ing the individual is:
Pi ¼
Fi
Pn�1
i¼0 Fi
ð9Þ
This process is repeated until an optimal connection weight is
achieved.
3.2. Genetic-Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (GENFIS)
Genetic-Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (GENFIS) is an infer-
ential technique proposed to integrate GA, NN and FL com-
ponents of Fig. 4 to provide a self-learning and adaptive
system for handling uncertain and imprecise data for diagnosis
of tuberculosis. The inference system employs feed forward
propagation learning technique made up of seven layers of
neurons as shown in Fig. 8. Both hidden and output layers
consist of active nodes where computations take place, while
the nodes at input layer are passive.
The inference engine consists of reasoning algorithm driven
by the production rules based on Mamdani’s Inference Mech-
anism. Of the seven layers, the ﬁrst one consists of active nodes
which denote inputs to the system. The inputs are numeric val-
ues representing how severe a patient feels the diagnosis vari-
ables. The output of this layer is the linguistic labels
corresponding to each input value. The second layer is made
up of adaptive nodes that receive the output of preceding layer
as input, and produce their corresponding membership grade
determined as:
L2ðxiÞ ¼ lAiðXiÞ
ð10Þ
The fuzzy value of each variable is computed using triangu-
lar MF, given as:
lAiðxiÞ ¼ xi � b
a � b
ð11Þ
where a and b are the variables of the triangular MF that
bounds its shape such that b 6 xi 6 a.
Third layer act as multipliers and their operations are ﬁxed
and labeled as M. These nodes compute the ﬁring strengths of
associated rules as:
L3ðXiÞ ¼ lAiðXiÞ � lBiðXiÞ � lCiðXiÞ
ð12Þ
In the fourth layer, nodes ﬁxed but they do normalize the
ﬁring strength of each rule. The normalized strength of a kth
rule is determined as:
L4ðXiÞ ¼
Wk
P3
j¼1Wj
ð13Þ
The product of normalized ﬁring strength of a rule and its
corresponding output value is observed in the ﬁfth layer to
determine the variable’s contribution to the diagnosis pro-
cesses. This is done with Eq. (14).
L5ðXiÞ ¼ L4ðXiÞ � L3ðXiÞ
ð14Þ
The sixth layer consists of a single ﬁxed node labeled Y
which represents the GENFIS’s ﬁnal output. It obtains the
cumulative sum of all incoming signals as shown in Eq. (15).
Y ¼
X
n
i¼1
L5ðxiÞ
ð15Þ
Finally, we employed Eq. (16) to classify the crispy numeric
value in Eq. (15) as the system’s output, which represents the
patient’s diagnosis result.

3.3. Decision support engine
The decision made by GENFIS is optimized by Decision Sup-
port Engine (DSE) which takes the output of GENFIS as
input and tunes to ﬁt any diagnostic case at hand [37]. The sup-
porting components of DSE are cognitive ﬁlter which objec-
tively inﬂuences the result of GENFIS on conformance basis
with knowledge extracted from medical personnel, holding
assumptions and beliefs with heuristics in medical ﬁeld and
emotional ﬁlter that refers to subjective feelings of a medical
personnel based on physical and psychological elicited from
patient. Emotional ﬁlter provides information that helps med-
ical personnel to decide whether a diagnostic result from GEN-
FIS is as a result of the patient’s situation or environmental
inhibiting factors.
4. Model simulation and evaluation
Simulation of the proposed model was done with a case study
of 10 patients from Saint Francis Catholic Hospital Okpara-
In-Land, Delta State, Nigeria. The procedure was observed
in Matrix Laboratory (MATLAB) Version 7.9 environment,
the result and evaluation of the simulations are reported in this
section.
4.1. Simulation
In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed model,
medical records of 100 patients’ representing their state of
health with respect to TB were formulated and stored as rules
in the database. Each rule is made up of 24 input variables and
an output variable. To determine the output value of each rule,
the records were retrieved and assessed by domain experts in
human respiratory diseases. Assessment was based on intensity
of the input variables and the expertise of the (human) expert.
Intensity of each variable represents its contribution to TB
infection, rating was thereafter done based on linguistic terms
shown in Table 2.
Result obtained from fuzziﬁcation of variables serves as
input to the neural network. Each node in the network is a
three-layered feed forward architecture which interacts with
each other as shown in Fig. 8. Back-propagation algorithm
with sigmoid function is used to train the NN for hidden
and output layer neurons’ transformation. The NN trained
by the subsystem consists of 24 nodes at the input layer, each
representing unique TB variables considered in this study. To
determine an optimal number of variables needed for a diag-
nosis, GA component of the proposed GENFIS takes all vari-
ables as input and optimizes them into just N variables whose
values have role to play in the diagnosis. Hence, the genotype
is represented by a sequence of symptoms as described earlier.
During simulation, binary-matrix vectors with length n
were created. Each element of the vector corresponds to speci-
ﬁc diagnostic parameters in NN. The binary bit of a diagnostic
parameter is determined using:

Hence, if the value of a parameter is equal to 1 then the
variable will be selected otherwise not. In this simulation, the
GA used selected values given in Table 3 to ﬁnd optimal solu-
tion and once a complete set of optimal value for the parame-
ters is reached, the GA processes stops. High mutation
probability used in the parameter settings is a brain behind
bringing new individuals at each stage hence, to avoid a sce-
nario whereby best combination will only be from initial indi-
viduals who passed ﬁrst selections.
4.2. Result and evaluation
Medical records of 10 patients from the Hospital of our case
study were taken as testing data for the system. Result
obtained from simulation indicates that GA component of
the proposed model can extract a maximum of 13 out of 24
parameters as the best combination. As shown in Table 4,
selected parameters show that the model is sensitive to radio-
graphic variables. The variables were selected for all cases with
diagnosis result above 50%. Diagnosis of records R04, R09,
and R10 by the model shows that patients possessing such
attributes have tuberculosis infection.
Result of this simulation procedure was validated by
human experts and their response using metrics proposed in
some previous studies. Human responses presented in Table 5
shows an expert either accepts the model’s result by assigning
‘‘p” or rejects it with ‘‘x”. In [36], sensitivity is a quality of
Neuro-Genetic model used to check the effects of selected
parameters on a trained NN with evaluation function.
Given a True Positive value (TP) that represents the num-
ber of patients with tuberculosis as agreed by both model and
human expert, a True Negative value (TN) indicating the num-
ber of patients where agreement could not be reached by both
model and human expert, and TNR as the total number of
records; the sensitivity and accuracy of GENFIS are:
Sensitivity ¼ TP
TNR � 100%
ð18Þ
Accuracy ¼ TP þ TN
TNR
� 100%
ð19Þ
From Table 5, the sensitivity and accuracy of the proposed
GENFIS are 60% and 70%.
5. Conclusion
The use of soft computing techniques in medical diagnosis can-
not be overemphasized as they have greatly imparted the pro-
cesses in medical diagnosis and aided an increase in diagnosis
accuracy. This novel study demonstrated how an aggregation
of such technique can assist in the diagnosis of TB. In the
approach, cognitive and emotional ﬁlters were adapted to take
care of contextual factors that often affect medical expert during
diagnosis of diseases in the traditional and conventional ways.
This study shows that a combination of the soft computing
methods can offer a more effective system of medical diagnosis
with improved system accuracy. For instance, [32] validated a
fuzzy-based expert system for tuberculosis diagnosis with 61%
accuracy. Also, in [24], a neuro-fuzzy decision support model
for therapy of heart failure was conducted and a sensitivity
analysis conducted shows that diagnosis done by the model
has a high concordance of 60.72% with physician’s diagnosis
at an accuracy of 57.14%. Unlike the proposed model, existing
systems does not have a thorough scope in terms of data set or
diagnosis depth and on a general sense, the model exhibits a
relatively higher performance when compared with existing
systems hence, depicting a more reliable results.

A Genetic-Neuro-Fuzzy inferential model
35
So well so good, this study demonstrates how triangular
membership functions of fuzzy logic system can be employed
to deﬁne linguistic labels and neural networks were introduced
for self-tuning and adaptation in case of new situations. Also,
for effective selection of optimal input parameters, Genetic
Algorithm has been incorporated. Yet, the effectiveness of
the model has only been validated using casual TB records
because the rule base of the knowledge base was formulated.
To further validate the results of this model, sufﬁcient real-
life records of TB patients can be obtained from medical clinics
in order to generate rules and training data sets.
