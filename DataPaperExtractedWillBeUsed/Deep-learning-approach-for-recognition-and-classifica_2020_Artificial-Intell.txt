On-time recognition and early control of the stresses in the paddy crops at the booting growth stage is the key to
prevent qualitative and quantitative loss of agricultural yield. The conventional paddy crop stress recognition and
classiﬁcation activities invariably rely on human experts identifying visual symptoms as a means of categoriza-
tion. This process is admittedly subjective and error-prone, which in turn can lead to incorrect actions being
taken in stress management decisions. The work presented in this paper aims to design a deep convolutional
neural network (DCNN) framework for automatic recognition and classiﬁcation of various biotic and abiotic
paddy crop stresses using the ﬁeld images. The work has adopted the pre-trained VGG-16 CNN model for the au-
tomatic classiﬁcation of stressed paddy crop images captured during the booting growth stage. The trained
models achieve an average accuracy of 92.89% on the held-out dataset, demonstrating the technical feasibility
of using the deep learning approach utilizing 30,000 ﬁeld images of 5 different paddy crop varieties with 12 dif-
ferent stress categories (including healthy/normal). The proposed work ﬁnds applications in developing the de-
cision support systems and mobile applications for automating the ﬁeld crop and resource management
practices.

1. Introduction
The paddy crop cultivation is an integral part of Indian agricultural
economy ranking ﬁrst in the area of cultivation with 43.92 million hect-
ares with the production of 111.50 million tons (Anonymous, 2018). Al-
though the overall numbers are impressive, the rice production has
come under increased pressure in Asia due to population growth and
changing socio-economic factors. The major paddy producing belts in
Asia regions achieves only 40% of total production efﬁciency due to
damage caused by drought, diseases, and pests. A more integrated ap-
proach involving optimum crop improvement and resource manage-
ment practices such as nutrient management, irrigation regime, and
other agronomic management factors for paddy crop with the existing
farmers' practices is a potential option for minimizing the crop yield
gap (Nutan et al., 2020; Alam et al., 2013).
The paddy crops are exposed to various types of stresses, both biotic
and abiotic as they grow in a wide range of environments characterized
by different temperatures, climates, and soil-water conditions, whose
combined effect can adversely affect crop performance and survival. It
is generally believed that the stresses are considered as a serious threat
to sustainable paddy production. Among these stresses, pathogen,
drought, over-irrigation or submergence, nutrient deﬁciency, toxicity
due to over-feeding of fertilizers, and high salinity stress factors have a
huge impact on the world agriculture and they reduce average yield
by more than 50%. The plans have evolved and developed speciﬁc
mechanisms to respond to complex stress conditions. The plant re-
sponses to the individual stress vary depending on the nature and se-
verity of the stress involved, the age of the plant at which the stress is
encountered, and inherent stress tolerant nature of the plants. The on-
time monitoring and recognition of these stresses, the supply of ade-
quate farm inputs and rapid morphological diagnoses can reduce the
adverse effects of stresses on the crops. The paddy crops under stress
show obvious symptoms in the color, shape and texture of the leaves
(Mew et al., 2018). It is difﬁcult to capture and quantify these micro-
symptoms using manual visual observation. The sample ﬁeld images
of normal and stressed paddy crops are shown in Fig. 1.

The leaf injury and leaf color variation are the two visual scoring
symptoms used in the classiﬁcation and determination of the stress cat-
egories. The trained personnel visually observe these symptoms as a
qualitative assessment to determine the stress types. This visual inspec-
tion of an individual leaf is subjective, time-consuming, destructive
sometimes, and tedious by nature. For identiﬁcation of plant Nitrogen
(N) nutrient deﬁciency, two easy decision instruments, namely Leaf
Color Chart (LCC) and Chlorophyll Meter (SPAD) are used (Ali et al.,
2017). As a plant N status indicator, the LCC measures the greenness
of the paddy crop leaf. In LCC, the accuracy is not guaranteed, especially
for different lighting conditions as the approach is based on visual in-
spection of leaf color. Fig. 2 shows the determination of paddy plant Ni-
trogen (N) demand using the chlorophyll meter (SPAD) and Leaf Color
Chart (LCC). An objective and rapid stress identiﬁcation system would
be beneﬁcial to the potential farmers and researchers for timely inter-
vention and mitigation of the problems by applying the proper crop
management strategies that can effectively boost the crop yields. Sev-
eral research works have proposed to detect and classify plant stresses
using image processing and machine learning techniques (Sun et al.,
2018; Latte et al., 2017; Yuan et al., 2016; Mohan et al., 2016; Yang
et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2014; Phadikar et al., 2012; Pugoy and
Mariano, 2011; Bock et al., 2010; Sanyal et al., 2007). These approaches
have attempted to build image classiﬁers using the handcrafted shape,
color, and texture features extracted from the individual crop leaf
images and the classiﬁer dependency on the handcrafted features
causes lack of automation. In recent years, the deep convolutional neu-
ral networks (DCNN) have shown the impressive results in many image
classiﬁcation tasks without using an expert designed or handcrafted
features (Singh et al., 2018; Mohanty et al., 2016). This brings the desire
of adopting deep learning in computer vision to develop a comprehen-
sive paddy plant stress recognition system which could be used as an ef-
fective tool in constructing crop management strategies. To know the
state-of-the-art in automation of paddy and allied crop stress recogni-
tion and classiﬁcation using a deep learning approach, a survey is
made and the gist of a survey is given as under.
2. Literature survey
Sambuddha et al. (2018) have proposed a deep machine vision-
based approach for identiﬁcation, classiﬁcation, and quantiﬁcation of
eight soybean plant stresses, including both biotic and abiotic using
25,000 images of stressed and healthy leaﬂets in the ﬁelds. The overall
classiﬁcation accuracy of 94.13% is achieved by the developed deep
CNN model. Konstantinos (2018) has developed ﬁve different deep
CNN models which include AlexNet, AlexNetOWTBn, GoogLeNet,
Overfeat and VGG for the identiﬁcation of plant disease combinations
using the simple leaves images of healthy and diseased plants. The
image dataset comprises 87,848 individual leaf images from 58 different

classes of plant-disease combinations of 25 different plant species. The
highest classiﬁcation accuracy of 99.53% is achieved using the VGG-
CNN model. Jiang Lu et al. (2017) have developed an in-ﬁeld automatic
wheat disease diagnosis system using the supervised deep learning
framework. The image dataset comprises 50,000 labeled images of
healthy and infected leaves of wheat crops. In the work, four different
CNN models have been developed to perform the recognition of 7
wheat disease classes and the VGG-16 model with fully connected
layers has given the maximum average recognition accuracy of
97.95%. Yang Lu et al. (2017) have presented a paddy crop disease iden-
tiﬁcation method using deep learning techniques. The image dataset
comprises 500 images of healthy and diseased rice leaves and stems.
The developed CNN model is inspired by LeNet-5 and AlexNet CNN ar-
chitectures. The work has considered 10 common paddy crop diseases
and an average recognition accuracy of 95.48% is obtained using the
trained CNN model. The work has also shown that the stochastic pooling
enhances the generalization ability of the CNN model and prevents
over-ﬁtting.
The literature survey has revealed that the researchers have exten-
sively used the deep learning techniques for plant or crop disease recog-
nition and classiﬁcation. In all the works, individual plant leaf images
have been used for the disease or stress recognition and classiﬁcation.
But, the diseases or stresses can occur in all parts of the plants apart
from the leaves. Moreover, there has not been any comprehensive
study and referable results on recognition and classiﬁcation of paddy
crop biotic and abiotic stresses using ﬁeld images yet. It is also under-
stood from the ﬁeld experts and the survey that the paddy crops are
more susceptible to different stresses during the booting growth stage
and the severe stress at this growth stage can cause irrecoverable dam-
age to the plants resulting in reduced yield. This brings the desire of de-
veloping a sophisticated deep learning framework for paddy plant
stress recognition and classiﬁcation system which could be used as an
effective tool in implementing crop management strategies.
In consultation with the agricultural experts and plant pathologists,
the present work considers 11 different types of stresses (including
both biotic and abiotic stresses) in paddy crops, namely, bacterial blight,
fungal blast, drought, submerged, Nitrogen deﬁciency, Phosphorus
deﬁciency, Potassium deﬁciency, Boron deﬁciency, Zinc deﬁciency,
Iron deﬁciency, and chemical injury. The stress classiﬁcation tree is
shown in Fig. 3.
3. Proposed methodology
To deal with the stated challenges, a deep learning-based approach
has been introduced to recognize and classify the paddy crop stresses.
The proposed methodology consists of two main stages, namely,
image dataset preparation and deep learning-based classiﬁcation. The
block diagram illustrating the stages involved in the proposed method-
ology is shown in Fig. 4.
3.1. Study area and site description
The experimental paddy ﬁelds are situated at All India Co-ordinate
Rice Improvement Project (AICRIP), Mugad, University of Agricultural
Sciences, Dharwad, India. The study area is categorized as the dry zone
with the annual rainfall ranges between 464.5 and 785.7 mm. The soil
is medium to deep black clay in larger areas and sandy loam in a small
portion with high organic matter content. Sixty experimental farmlands
were considered for the individual paddy crop stress analysis.
3.2. Crop sample preparation
In consultation with the University of Agricultural Sciences,
Dharwad, Karnataka State, India, ﬁve certiﬁed and popular paddy varie-
ties, namely, Jaya, Abhilasha, Mugad Suganda, Mugad 101 and Mugad
Siri are selected as experimental grain samples. The grain samples are
having 100% physical and genetic purity. The collected paddy grains
were sown separately in a raised bed nursery (direct seeding) as per
the standard guidelines. All the necessary precautions were taken to
maintain a uniform plant population of each variety and the plants
were grown under controlled nutrient conditions. These paddy crop va-
rieties were challenged by all the considered 11 stress types and the ob-
servations were carried out under conditions favoring normal growth
and expression of all the crop stress symptoms to fulﬁll the objectives

of the study. The ﬁeld tests were conducted during the Kharif season of
2018.
3.3. Image acquisition
The study considers the impact of 11 different stress classes on the 5
different selected paddy crop varieties. From each of the paddy crop va-
rieties, a total of 6000 images, considering 500 images per stress class
are acquired. A total of 500 healthy ﬁeld images per paddy crop variety
along with the stressed paddy ﬁeld images have been included in the
dataset. The stress identities were conﬁrmed by the experts. The
stresses such as bacterial blight and fungal blast were present at low
to a medium severity. Each image in this dataset is associated with an
expert marked label indicating a stress class. The images were captured
in the ﬁeld under natural light condition near solar noon which is the
period with the most stable illumination at the top of the atmosphere
using a Nikon D3300 Digital SLR camera having a resolution of 24
megapixels. The camera parameters, such as the ISO, shutter speed,
and aperture were set to 400, 1/500, and f/32, respectively. In order to
provide a rigid and stable support and easy movement, the camera
was mounted on a tripod stand. The angle between the camera lens
and the object axis was maintained at approximately 45°. The images
were taken keeping the object distance of 2.5 m from the imaged
crops. A white foam board was used as a reﬂector to bounce and inten-
sify natural light in the opposite direction to ﬁll the shadows.
Over 30,000 labeled images are collected to create the experimental
dataset of paddy ﬁeld images from healthy crops and the crops
exhibiting different stresses. As a part of the dataset preparation, the ac-
quired images of size 1920 × 1080 pixels are manually cropped to a
ﬁxed size of 150 × 150 pixels with the assistance of agricultural experts
and rice scientists. The sample ﬁeld images of Jaya paddy crop under
various stress conditions are shown in Fig. 5.
3.4. CNN model conﬁguration and architecture
The proposed work has employed the pre-trained VGG-16 CNN
model for the classiﬁcation of normal and stressed paddy crop im-
ages because of its state-of-the-art performance in the image classi-
ﬁcation tasks (Simonyan and Zisserman, 2015, Wang et al., 2017,
Kamilaris and Prenafeta-Boldú, 2018). The model is an extremely ho-
mogeneous architecture that only performs 3 × 3 convolutions and
2 × 2 pooling from the beginning to the end. The model is imple-
mented using a higher level Python library Keras which runs over
an open source deep learning framework TensorFlow as a backend
to classify the stressed paddy crop ﬁeld images. The image dimen-
sion is set to 150 × 150 pixels with depth 3 (RGB channels) and the
images are passed through the stack of convolutional layers with
the convolution ﬁlter size 3 × 3 and convolution strides in x and y di-
rections (1,1) pixels. The spatial size is preserved after convolution
using hyper parameter padding 1. The spatial pooling is carried out
by using ﬁve max pooling layers with the pooling size 2 × 2 pixels.
The activation function ‘ReLu’ has been considered in all the hidden
layers and the ‘softmax’ function is applied to the ﬁnal layer to en-
sure the predicted probability output values are in the range of 0
and 1. The network uses 20 epochs and a batch size of 12. The net-
work has been optimized using the gradient descent optimization al-
gorithm with categorical cross entropy logarithmic loss function.
The model receives the paddy crop images of size 150 × 150 pixels as
input. Then it has a sequence of two convolutional and pooling layers as
feature extractors, followed by a fully connected layer to interpret the
features and an output layer. The output layer has 12 neurons, which
correspond to the number of stress classes in which the input image
need to be classiﬁed. The schematic structure of the network model
layers is shown in Fig. 6.
4. Experimental results and discussion
The experimental classiﬁcation model consists of ﬁve separate VGG-
16 CNN models, considering one for each of the paddy crop varieties as
shown in Fig. 6.8. In each paddy crop variety, there have been twelve
classes to distinguish. In order to improve the performance of the CNN
models, the original ﬁeld image dataset with 12,000 images has been
enhanced to 30,000 labeled images (considering 6000 images per
paddy crop variety) using various image augmentation techniques
such as random rescaling, perturbations to brightness, shear transform,
vertical ﬂip, horizontal ﬂip, and skewing. All the augmented images
show remarkable variation with the original images. The enhanced
image set has been split into 60% training (3600 images per paddy
crop variety) and 40% testing (2400 images per paddy crop variety) to
evaluate the accuracy of the individual CNN model. The 10% of the test
dataset has been used as the validation set.
The models have been executed on a desktop computer conﬁgured
with an Intel Core i5-4210U processor, 8 GB of RAM and one GeForce
NVIDIA 1070 GPU. The models have been trained and tested using the
respective paddy crop variety images by considering the pre-trained
weights provided by the Oxford group in all the layers until conver-
gence. The confusion matrices are generated from all the individual
models to reveal the erroneous predictions and they are shown in
Fig. 7. The performance measures, namely, precision, recall, and mean
classiﬁcation accuracy of each stress class are computed from the confu-
sion matrices and they are listed in Table 1. The graphical representation
of the average stress classiﬁcation accuracy results for each paddy crop
variety is shown in Fig. 8. From Fig. 8, the maximum and minimum
Fig. 6. Schematic structure of the VGG-16 CNN model layers.

average stress classiﬁcation accuracies of 95.08% and 90.75% are ob-
tained for the paddy crop varieties Mugad 101 and Jaya, respectively.
The trained models achieve an average stress classiﬁcation accuracy of
92.89% on the held-out dataset, demonstrating the technical feasibility
of using the deep learning approach utilizing 30,000 ﬁeld images of
ﬁve different paddy crop varieties with twelve different stress catego-
ries (including healthy/normal).
4.1. Comparison of BPNN and VGG-16 CNN classiﬁcation results
The classiﬁcation results of the present VGG-16 CNN model
are corroborated with the developed Backpropagation Neural
Network (BPNN) classiﬁcation model (Anami et al., 2019). The
BPNN classiﬁer is trained with three lower order color statistics,
namely mean, variance and skew, and two color descriptors de-
ﬁned by the MPEG-7 standard, namely Dominant Color Descriptor
(DCD) and Color Layout Descriptor (CLD) to express the color
distribution and variations in the ﬁeld images of paddy crops
under various stresses. Table 2 depicts the average stress classiﬁ-
cation comparison results between VGG-16 CNN and BPNN classi-
ﬁcation models across twelve stress classes from ﬁve paddy crop
varieties considered. From Table 2, it is observed that the perfor-
mance of VGG-16 CNN model is slightly better than the BPNN
classiﬁer.

5. Conclusion and future scope
In the present work, an attempt has been made to automate the rec-
ognition and classiﬁcation of paddy crop stresses using the on ﬁeld im-
ages and it has been successfully demonstrated by employing the deep
learning techniques. The approach presented is applicable to 11 classes
of biotic and abiotic stresses from 5 different paddy crop varieties. The
best performing pre-trained deep learning model VGG-16 has been
used in the classiﬁcation task. The maximum average stress classiﬁca-
tion accuracy of 95.08% has been achieved using the VGG-16 by learning
over 6000 images of Mugad 101 paddy crop variety. The results
obtained are encouraging as the work considers more number of
paddy crop stress classes and the varieties than in the reported works.
But still, there is a scope for improvement. The stress classiﬁcation per-
formance of the VGG-16 model will be compared with the similar state-
of-the-art models such as ResNet, GoogLeNet, Inception-v3, and LeNet
as a future scope. The work carried out is challenging in terms of high ir-
regularity in an outdoor environment. The generality of the proposed
approach can make it applicable to a wide range of ﬁeld crops, such as
wheat, maize, barley, soybean etc. The effects of environmental condi-
tions such as extreme temperatures and soil factors, the presence of
combinatorial stresses, the quantiﬁcation of stresses, and the prediction
