Machine learning
The purpose of this paper is to classify wines from 4 different countries in South America. Each class of wines is
formed by samples considered by experts as representatives of the following commercial categories: “Argentin-
ean Malbec (AM)”, “Brazilian Merlot (BM)”, “Uruguayan Tannat (UT)” and “Chilean Carménère (CC)”. The 83
samples collected were analyzed according to their composition of volatiles, semi-volatiles and phenolic com-
pounds. We built a decision system for classiﬁcation based on support vector machines (SVM), along with
Correlation-based Feature selection (CFS), and Random Forest Importance (RFI), which measures the relative im-
portance of the input variables. First, we use CFS to select a subset of variables among 190 chemical compounds.
Thirteen chemicals were selected as correlated to the category and uncorrelated with each other. Afterwards,
these chemical compounds were organized according to the importance ranking given by the RFI and classiﬁed
with SVM. The study clearly indicated that SVM in combination with feature selection methods was able to iden-
tify the most important chemicals to classify the wine samples. Among the compounds identiﬁed in the wine
samples, the variable subset deﬁned by the feature selection methods, which were catechin, gallic, octanoic
acid, myricetin, caffeic, isobutanol, resveratrol, kaempferol, and ORAC, were able to achieve an accuracy of
93.97% in classifying the commercial categories.

1. Introduction
The combination of instrumental analyses with machine learning
have allowed the successful classiﬁcation of various products and
foods according to geographical origin, varieties, and the type of farming
system (conventional or organic) (Jiménez-Carvelo et al., 2019; Versari
et al., 2014). The main reason to discriminate food products is quality
control and authentication, in order to avoid unfair competition that
can create a destabilized market and disrupt the regional economy
and even the national economy (Callao and Ruisánchez, 2018;
Cordella et al., 2002).
Particularly, the wine classiﬁcation according to variety and region is
an important issue because it is an easily adulterated product in terms of
dilution of wines with water, the addition of alcohol, mislabeling, and
blending with, or replacement by, wine of a lesser quality of denomination.
Analytical techniques such as High Performance Liquid Chromatogrphy
(HPLC), coupled mass spectrometry detection (MS), Fourier Transform
Infrared (FTIR), among others, are able to describe wines in chemicals
compounds that can reveal useful information about the identity of each
wine (Versari et al., 2014; Villano et al., 2017).
The world wine production reached in 2018 a volume of 292.3 mil-
lion of hectoliters, being more than 30 million hectoliters only in
Argentina, Chile, Brazil and Uruguay (Wine, 2019), representing an im-
portant sector of economy of these countries. South American wines
have been the object of study of several research in order to classify
the geographical origin and varietal. These studies have been performed
mainly by the use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear
Discrimination Analysis (LDA) (Belmiro et al., 2017; Llobodanin et al.,
2014; Pisano et al., 2015; Versari et al., 2014). The use of linear methods
is enough to obtain satisfactory results and the methods are easy for
chemists to understand. However, there are several physical-chemical
parameters that characterize samples, resulting in complex data with
some nonlinearity. Classical linear methods such as discriminant analy-
sis cannot model this nonlinearity. This way, nonlinear methods are re-
quired (Jiménez-Carvelo et al., 2019; Li et al., 2009).
Support Vector Machines (SVM) is one of the most popular and
sophisticated machine learning techniques. This technique separates
the samples by an optimal hyperplane that maximizes the distances

between classes. When there are no linear decision boundaries, the
original dataset (x) is converted into a new space f(x) which there is a
linear decision boundary that separates the samples into their classes.
SVM has been successfully used in many different applications, such
as: food science (Araújo et al., 2019; Richter et al., 2019; Soares et al.,
2018; Turra et al., 2017), medicine (Froz et al., 2017; Vogado et al.,
2018), forensic science (Maione et al., 2018), among others.
In previous studies, some Vitis Vinífera wines from South America
were analyzed with machine learning using feature selection and sup-
port vector machines based on their antioxidant activity, phenolic sub-
stances, anthocyanins and color (Costa et al., 2018, 2019; da Costa et al.,
2016). The use of feature selection allowed to identify the most impor-
tant chemical descriptors that characterize the geographical origin of
wines. The study of Soares (Soares et al., 2018) also classiﬁed South
America wines based on elemental concentrations, machine learning
and feature selection. The authors proposed a new ﬁlter feature selec-
tion method and achieved seven elements that classiﬁed the wines in
99.9% of accuracy.
Information like a reduced set of chemical descriptors that can clas-
sify food samples obtained from feature selection methods can reduce
costs related to the chemical analysis of uncorrelated compounds, re-
duce the computational time required to analyze the data, can improve
accuracy and provide useful information to prevent and to identify food
fraud.
In this study, samples of South American wines were analyzed based
on the phenolic, semi-volatile and volatile compounds. Few studies had
used feature selection methods to classify wine samples based on phe-
nolic and volatile compounds. The study of (Rebolo et al., 2000) used
ﬁve chemical compounds selected based on Stepwise Bayesian Analysis
algorithm to classify Galician red wines along with LDA, k-nearest
neighbors and soft independent class modeling. Mihena et al. (Mihnea
et al., 2015) classiﬁed different pre-fermentative maceration techniques
of Mencía wines with forward stepwise linear discriminant analysis.
This technique was also used to select the most important chemical pa-
rameters to classify Chinese rice wines (Shen et al., 2012), Andalusian
sweet wines (Márquez et al., 2008), and the variety of Chinese red
wines (Zhang et al., 2010).
The objective of this study is to characterize the main phenolic, semi-
volatile and volatile compounds which are able to discriminate the four
“Commercial Categories” of South American wines, named Argentinean
Malbec (AM)”, “Brazilian Merlot (BM)”, “Uruguaian Tannat (UT)” and
“Chilean Carménère (CC)”, based on Support vector machines (SVM)
combined with feature selection methods named Correlation Based Fea-
ture Selection and Random Forest Importance. To our knowledge, this is
the ﬁrst study to combine SVM and two feature selection methods to
classify wine samples based on phenolic, semi-volatile and volatile
compounds.
2. Material and methods
2.1. Material
A group of wine experts from the “Brazilian Association of Somme-
liers (ABS-SP, São Paulo, Brazil)” was invited to list examples of wines
that were the best representatives of four categories: “Argentinean
Malbec (AM)”, “Brazilian Merlot (BM)”, “UruguaianTannat (UT)” and
“Chilean Carménère (CC)”. The ABS-SP group is formed by experts
with elevated experience in the wine degustation, market and technol-
ogy (www.abs-sp.com.br). The following question was placed to the ex-
perts: “If you had to show to someone what is an authentic, for example,
Argentinean Malbec, which wine would you recommend?” To answer
this question, the experts elaborated a list containing the brand and vin-
tage of each category. From this list, 83 wines (2008–2015) were pur-
chased from the local stores covering a price range from 12 to 135
USD for 750 mL bottle. The list of wines applied in this study included
14 UT, 26 MA, 33 CC and 10 BM. The bottle was opened, the wine was
immediately aliquoted and kept at -80 °C until the analysis. The re-
agents 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazil (DPPH), ﬂuorescein, 2,2′-Azobis
(2-methylpropionamidine) dihydrochloride (AAPH), epicatechin,
caffeic acid, gallic acid, ferulic acid, rutin, trans-resveratrol, myricetin,
quercetin, kaempferol were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Sigma
Chemical Co, St. Louis, United States). The anthocyanins cyanidin-3-
glucoside, delphinidin-3-glucoside, peonidin-3-glucoside, petunidin-3-
glucoside and malvidin-3-glucoside were obtained from Polyphenols
Laboratories AS (Polyphenols SA, Sandnes, Norway). All other chemical
and solvents were analytical grade.
2.2. Methods
The semi-volatile compounds were analyzed using Quadrupole
Time-of-Flight (QTOF) Liquid Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry ac-
cording to 5991-3335EN Application Note (Agilent Technologies, Inc.,
Palo Alto, USA). Volatiles and phenolic compounds were analyzed ac-
cording to Cabredo-Pinillos et al. (2004) and Jaitz et al. (2010), respec-
tively. The antioxidant activity of the samples was analyzed by three
methods. ORAC was carried out according to Huang et al. (2005).
DPPH analysis was based on method reported by Brand-Williams et al.
(1995), while FRAP was performed according to Benzie and Strain
(1996). The distribution of the compounds found is as follows: 21 phe-
nolic components, 29 volatiles and 140 semi-volatiles. More informa-
tion about the HPLC chromatograms is given by Valentin et al. (2020).
2.2.1. Support vector machines
Support Vector Machines (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995) is one of the
best known and most used classiﬁcation algorithms which aim to ﬁnd
a hyperplane with maximum margin to separate the classes of data.
This hyperplane is a special type of linear model. In the linear case a
database with two class of data is easily separated by a hyperplane in
two groups, which one represents one of the classes and the other
group represents the other class. The samples that are closest to the
maximum-margin hyperplane are called support vectors. The non-
linear cases begin to be solved in 1995 when Cortes & Vapnik intro-
duced the use of the soft-margin, which uses slack variables to penalize
samples that characterize the non-linearity of data. When there are no
linear decision boundaries the original dataset (x) is converted into a
new space f(x) by the kernel trick. In the new space f(x) there is a linear
decision boundary that separates the samples into their classes.
2.2.2. Feature selection
The feature selection (variable elimination) helps in understanding
data, reducing the effect of high dimensionality, reducing computa-
tional time and improving the classiﬁer performance (Chandrashekar
and Sahin, 2014). We use Correlation-based feature selection (CFS) to
select a subset of the most important variable and Random Forest Im-
portance (RFI) to order the variables selected. The CFS selected a feature
subset that contains features highly correlated with the class, yet uncor-
related with each other (Hall, 1999). The Random Forest Importance
(RFI) uses the random forest classiﬁer to measure the importance of
input variables (Breiman, 2001). This technique is a ﬁlter feature selec-
tor, which uses variable ranking as the principle criteria for variable se-
lection by ordering.
2.2.3. Performance analysis
The classiﬁcations occurred by the use of 10-fold cross validation to
evaluating the performance of SVM. This technique splits the dataset (in
our case, 83 samples) into 10 folds and performs 10 classiﬁcations. Each
classiﬁcation is accomplished in the following way: nine folds are used
to train the model and the tenth fold is used to test the model, generat-
ing a precision rate (accuracy). This process is performed until all ten
folds are used for testing. At the end of the process, the performance
of the classiﬁcation model is given as the average of the accuracy

obtained in each partition. All machine learning tasks and graphs were
performed using the R software (R Core Team, 2017).
3. Results and discussion
Fig. 1 shows the steps carried out in this study. After select the wines,
they were analyzed according to their composition of phenolic, volatiles
and semi-volatiles compounds. Next, we applied the machine learning
techniques to investigate the distinction of the commercial categories.
About 600 peaks were isolated to volatile compounds, semi-volatile
compounds by negative mode and semi-volatile compounds by positive
mode compounds. From them, just the peaks that it was possible to iden-
tify the formula were selected (169 peaks). The dataset used in this study
has 83 samples described in 169 volatile and semi-volatile compounds
peaks besides 21 variables relative to antioxidant activity and phenolic
compounds associated to one of the classes (AM, BM, CC, UT). The num-
ber of samples of each class was distributed as follows: 26 Argentinean
Malbec samples, 10 Brazilian Merlot samples, 33 Chilean Carménère
samples, and 14 Uruguayan Tannat samples. The class labels (the chem-
ical categories) were selected by a panel of wine experts on base on their
sensory properties. This aspect is essential because researchers, usually,
do not have this information, and proportion of market share can be
more related to price conditions than wines authenticity.
3.1. Classiﬁcation and analysis of all dataset
The classiﬁcation algorithm SVM was applied considering the original
190 variables ﬁrst (169 volatile and semi-volatile compounds peaks and
21 variables relative to antioxidant activity and phenolic compounds).
Results achieved in this step are considered as “references” to which
any others can be compared. The SVM model obtained 39.76% of accuracy
by the use of all 190 variables. All the samples were classiﬁed as “Chilean
Carménère”. The accuracy value obtained in this model is explained by
the number of CC samples. There are 33 CC samples in the database
and all samples were classiﬁed as CC. Only the 33 CC samples were cor-
rectly classiﬁed, which represent 39.76% of the total samples.
An exploratory analysis by means of principal component analysis
(PCA) was carried out to investigate this result. This technique is based
on a linear transformation of data into different orthogonal coordinates
using maximum variance and minimum correlation. By reducing the
number of features from 190 original variables to two principal compo-
nents, the information is enough to allow an examination of the samples
according to the commercial category in a 2D-plot (Fig. 2). There is no
natural separation among the classes. Three clusters can be identiﬁed,
however, each one is formed with samples of all classes.
The ﬁrst conclusion is that all phenolic and volatile compounds can-
not discriminate among the commercial categories. The low classiﬁcation
rate can be explained considering the fact that is possible to exists noise
or irrelevant variables in our dataset. Therefore, we applied feature selec-
tion methods to select a subset of variables from the input which can ef-
ﬁciently describe the input data and discriminate among the classes.
3.2. Feature selection
CFS were applied to all dataset and returned 13 variables. They are:
ORAC, octanoic acid, isobutanol, 2-phenyletanol, isorhamnetin, ethyl
lactate, sv(+) 16 - not identiﬁed semi-volatile, gallic, catechin, caffeic,
myricetin, resveratrol and kaempferol. Table 1 shows the mean
and the standard deviation of the chemical's concentration for each
commercial category along with the results of Kruskal Wallis test. The
variables ORAC, 2-phenyletanol and gallic present a very close concen-
tration values for the commercial categories AM, BM, and CC, and a
higher concentration for the UT (p value <0.05). The UT concentrations
for these variables presented a signiﬁcant difference. The variables
octanoic acid and isobutanol showed highest values for the BM and CC
categories (p value <0.05) and AM and UT were not signiﬁcant different
from each other. Ethyl lactate and resveratrol presented a highest con-
centration values for the BM wines (p value <0.05). There is no pattern
among the statistical differences in the variable's concentrations among
the commercial categories. An advanced analysis is need to differentiate
the categories based on this chemical composition.
A PCA analysis was carried out on the selected variables. Fig. 3
shows the score plot of the ﬁrst two principal components. A natural

separation between BM and CC can be observed. The samples of AM and
UT are separated from BM and CC, but there is an overlap between these
classes. The variables selected by CFS showed more discriminative
power than all phenolic and volatile compounds when analyzing the
distance among the samples.
The variables selected by CFS were submitted to a ﬁlter method of
feature selection, the RFI. This method ranks the features according to
the classiﬁcations performed by the Random Forest classiﬁer by the
use of one variable at time as predictor. The feature selection performed
by the CFS aimed to reduce the number of variables and the RFI goal was
ordering the features wherein the variables were selected and applied
to the predictor according to the importance of each one. Fig. 4 shows
the importance of each variable according to RFI.
3.3. Classiﬁcation results
Based on the information of the RFI, we performed 13 classiﬁcation
models as follows. The ﬁrst classiﬁcation model used only the most im-
portant variable (catechin), the second classiﬁcation model used the
two most important variables (catechin and gallic), and so forth, until
the thirteenth classiﬁcation model, which used the thirteen variables
selected by CFS. Table 2 shows the results obtained from these thirteen
classiﬁcation models. It is presented the model ID, the variables used as
input to SVM and the accuracy values for each classiﬁcation model. The
higher result is the one that used nine variables, catechin, gallic,
octanoic acid, myricetin, caffeic, isobutanol, resveratrol, kaempferol
and ORAC, with 93.97% of accuracy. Just one variable results in the
lower accuracy, 68.49%. These value increases when variables are
added. The peak of accuracy occurs with the #09 classiﬁcation model.
This value decreases and stabilizes between a range of values when
more variables are added.
Table 3 shows the confusion matrix of the classiﬁcation model #09.
All samples of CC class were correctly classiﬁed. One sample of BM
class, two samples of AM class, and two samples of UT class were
misclassiﬁed. These results suggest that the CC class is the purest
among them, in which the nine chemical components of the subset
#09 is able to correctly classify all the samples. The other data classes
have few samples that were misclassiﬁed, indicating that there is a little
similarity among the others commercial categories. However, the classi-
ﬁcation model achieved a good classiﬁcation rate of 93.97%.
4. Discussion
Phenolic and volatile proﬁles are the most involved compounds in
the sensory identity of wine (Villano et al., 2017). Thus, these com-
pounds can be used on discriminatory analysis to classify wines.

However, as the results of this study demonstrated, there is some vari-
ables that do not contributed to the classiﬁcation model. The use of all
chemicals resulted on a low predictive performance and there is no
clear separation on the PCA score plot. The selection of a feature subset
played an important role to classify the commercial categories of South
American wines.
It was found that a group of phenolic and volatile was the more dis-
criminative compounds. The model #09 used seven phenolic and two
volatile compounds. The ORAC was previously identiﬁed by the use of
feature selection as one of the main chemicals that are able to classify
Chilean and Brazilian Sauvignon Cabernet wines (da Costa et al.,
2016), Uruguayan and Brazilian Tannat wines (Costa et al., 2018), and
South American Merlot wines (Costa et al., 2019). Zhang et al. (2010)
selected 11 volatiles compounds from Chinese red wines by the use of
stepwise linear discriminant analysis. The authors found that esters
and alcohols are responsible for varietal classiﬁcation of Chinese
Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Gernischt and Merlot wines.
Márquez et al. (2008) found that the variables α-terpineol,
5-methyl-2-furaldehyde, isoamyl alcohols, ethyl decanoate, hexanal
and p-cymene was the mainly descriptors to classify Andalusian sweet
wines. The study of Mihnea et al. (2015) correctly classiﬁed all samples
of Mencía wines by the use of 22 of 42 variables, mainly alcohols, esters
and acids.
Although the use of variable selectors improves the performance of
classiﬁcation models and reduces the experimental costs, there is little
research in the area of wine classiﬁcation using these techniques. The
future of food authentication depends on combining the information
from different analytical techniques (Villano et al., 2017) and modeling
algorithms capable to handle the non-linearly of data and complex
problems, such as artiﬁcial neural networks, SVM, decision trees and
random forest, that show a great potential and more advantages com-
pared to conventional ones (Jiménez-Carvelo et al., 2019). Therefore,
our results strongly contribute as an application of machine learning
and feature selection methods to a wine database composed of four
commercial categories described on phenolic and volatile compounds.
5. Conclusion
This work demonstrated the use of SVM and two feature selection
methods to classify four commercial categories of South American
red wines (“Argentinean Malbec (AM)”, “Brazilian Merlot (BM)”,
“Uruguayan Tannat (UT)” and “Chilean Carménère (CC)”). Among the
190 variables that described volatiles, semi-volatiles, antioxidant activ-
ity and phenolic compounds, 13 were selected by CFS. From this vari-
able subset nine chemicals were identiﬁed by RFI with a classiﬁcation
capacity greater than the set of 13 variables. The SVM was able to clas-
sify the samples according to their respective classes in an accuracy of
93.97%. The compounds selected were catechin, gallic, octanoic acid,
myricetin, caffeic, isobutanol, resveratrol, kaempferol, and ORAC. That
not only reduced the experimental cost effectively, but also made the
analysis of the results more comprehensible due the reduced number
of variables. PCA was used to an exploratory analysis before and after
feature selection. The ﬁrst plot did not show any patters or groups. On
the other hand, the PCA score plot based on the selected variables
shows some trends and separation among the classes.
One aspect that differentiates this research from the other studies
that conducted wine classiﬁcation is that we use feature selection tech-
niques to identify a subset of chemical compounds that were able to
classify the data from multiple sources. In addition, our methodology
can be applied in other products and wines to identify the most impor-
tant chemicals which characterize the classes, reduce data dimensional-
ity, and improve the classiﬁcation rate.
