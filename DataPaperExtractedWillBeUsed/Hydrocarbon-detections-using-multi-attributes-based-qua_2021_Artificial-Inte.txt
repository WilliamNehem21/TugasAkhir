A direct hydrocarbon detection is performed by using multi-attributes based quantum neural networks with gas
ﬁelds. The proposed multi-attributes based quantum neural networks for hydrocarbon detection use data clus-
tering and local wave decomposition based seismic attenuation characteristics, relative wave impedance features
of prestack seismic data as the selected multiple attributes for one tight sandstone gas reservoir and further
employ principal component analysis combined with quantum neural networks for giving the distinguishing
results of the weak responses of the gas reservoir, which is hard to detect by using the conventional technologies.
For the seismic data from a tight sandstone gas reservoir in the Sichuan basin, China, we found that multi-
attributes based quantum neural networks can effectively capture the weak seismic responses features associ-
ated with gas saturation in the gas reservoir. This study is hoped to be useful as an aid for hydrocarbon detections
for the gas reservoir with the characteristics of the weak seismic responses by the complement of the multi-
attributes based quantum neural networks.
1. Introduction
Hydrocarbon detection methods started from the emergence of the
bright spot technique in the 1970s which highlights the reﬂection
amplitude changes on the seismic sections and increases the gas layer
identiﬁcation from about 12% to around 60%–80% (Hammond, 1974). It
is found that the bright spot technique is more suitable for the gas
identiﬁcation of young, relatively uncompacted sediments in ocean ba-
sins than deep deposits below 8000–10000 feet due to the seismic
attenuation (Hammond, 1974). In some deep and old strata, the seismic
responses of the gas layers on the seismic section may be presented as ﬂat
spots or dim spots (Backus and Chen, 1975; Brown, 2012).
AVO analysis is one widely used hydrocarbon detection technique in
the recent days (e.g., Wandler et al., 2007; Dupuy and Stovas, 2014;
Ismail et al., 2020). The basis of AVO analysis is the Zoeppritz equation
that has many expression forms and approximates to mainly reﬂect the
reﬂection coefﬁcients and the amplitude of the reﬂection wave which is a
complex function of the incident angle and the physical parameters on
both sides of the reﬂection interface (e.g., Aki and Richards, 1980; Shuey,
1985; Castagna and Backus, 1993a; Fatti et al., 1994). From the different
approximates of the Zoeppritz equation, many types of pre-stack seismic
inversion methods are developed to obtain many physical parameters
such as longitudinal and transverse waves' velocity and density, Poisson's
ratio, and relative wave impedance for hydrocarbon detections (Castagna
and Backus, 1993b; Pan et al., 1994; Tetyukhina et al., 2014; Cao et al.,
2021). Although AVO analysis has a rigorous mathematical foundation,
there are many assumptions in practice applications, and the current
successful application cases are basically clastic rock reservoirs with
shallow burial.
Seismic attenuation estimation methods are another widely used
techniques which use the energy attenuation characteristics of seismic
waves for reservoir characterization and hydrocarbon detection (e.g.,
Mitchell et al., 1996; Partyka et al., 1999; Castagna et al., 2003; Sinha
et al., 2005; Xue et al., 2016a; Wang et al., 2019). Laboratory experi-
ments and ﬁeld data measurements show that seismic wave attenuated
more pronouncedly for viscous ﬂuid-saturated rocks than dry rocks in
most frequency bandwidths and the high-frequency components of
seismic waves are attenuated more rapidly than the low-frequency
components in gas-prone sediments (Domenico, 1974; Anderson and
Hampton, 1980; Dvorkin and Nur, 1993; del Valle-García and Ramír-
ez-Cruz, 2002; Korneev et al., 2004; Xue et al., 2019). Strong amplitude
anomalies of seismic waves at speciﬁc frequencies can be easily found

through the seismic attenuation estimation methods such as spectrum
decomposition (e.g., Castagna et al., 2003; Korneev et al., 2004; Sinha
et al., 2005; Duchesne et al., 2011) and attenuation gradient estimation
(e.g., Mitchell et al., 1996; Pramanik et al., 2000; del Valle-García and
Ramírez-Cruz 2002; Xue et al., 2016a). Seismic attenuation estimation
technology mainly uses the time-frequency methods to estimate the
attenuation. The conventional time-frequency methods including the
short-time Fourier transform, wavelet transform, Wigner-ville distribu-
tion are always limited by the Heisenberg/Gabor uncertainty principle
and cannot have a high resolution at time and frequency simultaneously
(Gabor,
1946).
The
recent
local
wave
decomposition
based
high-resolution time-frequency methods including the Hilbert-huang
transform,
scynchrosqueezed
transforms
show
much
higher
time-frequency
resolution
than
the
conventional
time-frequency
methods, but the narrow frequency band properties of these methods
are the major challenge for seismic interpretation (Xue et al., 2019).
In recent days, machine learning (ML) methods are also used for
delineate reservoirs by the formulation of ﬂuid and rock properties of gas
reservoirs to a set of predeﬁned seismic attributes (Chaki et al., 2018;
Kadkhodaie and Kadkhodaie, 2022). Artiﬁcial neural network (ANN) is
used to build models for reservoir permeability prediction (Zolotukhin
and Gayubov, 2019; Tian et al., 2021). Tahmasebi et al. (2017) combined
the fuzzy logic approach with neural networks and the genetic algorithm
for predicting the total organic carbon and fracable index in shale res-
ervoirs. Wang et al. (2020) utilized fuzzy self-organizing map and the
radial basis function neural network for spectral attributes generated
from principal component analysis of the common frequency sections to
estimate reservoir thickness. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) and
relevant vector machine are veriﬁed to have better performance in most
cases than the ANN with different shallow models due to an improved
parameter selection in reservoir characterization (Otchere et al., 2021).
Delavar (2022) applied the hybrid SVM and grey wolf optimizer methods
for fracture classiﬁcation in carbonate reservoirs. Long Short-Term
Memory is used to build a prediction model for water saturation pre-
diction (Zhang et al., 2019). Singh et al. (2021) comparatively studied 12
different ML algorithms, which belong to the classes of ridge regression
and its variants, decision tree and its variants, k-nearest neighbour,
reduced order models and neural network, for predicting gas hydrate
saturation. However, it is difﬁcult to ﬁnd a single ML method working for
all the reservoirs due to the different lithology and geology.
In this paper, for enhancing the approximation and information
processing efﬁciency of conventional neural networks, we attempt to use
quantum neural networks to extract the features from the integration of
data clustering results, local wave decomposition based seismic attenu-
ation, relative wave impedance attributes of pre-stack seismic data, and
give the distinguishing results of the weak gas responses in one tight
sandstone gas reservoir in the Sichuan basin, China, which is hard to
detect by using the conventional technologies.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Seismic data
The prestack seismic data from the gas ﬁeld in one tight sandstone gas
reservoir in the Sichuan basin, China, is collected. The reservoir which is
mainly the multi-phase multi-stacked Delta plain and Delta front domi-
nated river sand body has the characteristics of strong heterogeneity, low
porosity and permeability (Li et al., 2016; Lu et al., 2019). The physical
properties difference between sandstone and mudstone in the work area
is small. Some sand bodies which belong to the hidden river sands are
very thin. The seismic response is weak (Tan et al., 2021), and gas
detection in the reservoir especially for the non-bright spot channels is
difﬁcult.
Here, six well logging data and the corresponding seismic traces
intersecting the known wells are used for training the quantum gate set
neural network (QGSNN). According to the well interpretations, the gas
reservoirs are divided into four types: strong gas layer, poor gas layer, gas
and water layer, hidden reservoirs. Hydrocarbon detections for two
seismic sections intersecting the known wells named A and B are ana-
lysed in detail. The seismic signals are sampled at 1 ms. The far (incident
angle ranges from 29∘ to 40∘) and near (incident angle ranges from 0∘ to
13∘) offset trace stacked proﬁles are used for hydrocarbon detection.
2.2. Quantum neural networks
Quantum neural network (QNN) which combines the basics of ANN
with quantum computation paradigm can better simulate the informa-
tion processing procedure in the human brain and enhance approxima-
tion and information processing efﬁciency of neural networks (Kak,
1995; Menneer, 1998; Behrman et al., 1999; Ezhov and Ventura, 2000;
Matsui et al., 2009; Kouda et al., 2003; Schuld et al., 2014). Currently, it
has been successfully applied to ﬁelds such as image processing, pattern
recognition, handwritten characters recognition (e.g., Masato et al.,
2000; Ren et al., 2010; Mu et al., 2013). Till date there are various types
of QNN model (Jeswal and Chakraverty, 2019). In this paper, we adopt a
QGSNNfor hydrocarbon detection.
QGSNN is a combination of several universal quantum gates in
accordance with a certain topology. A three-layer neural network struc-
ture including the input layer, the hidden layer, and the output layer is
adopted in this paper. In QGSNN model (Fig. 1), the input is jxi >;ði ¼
1; 2;⋯nÞ, and θ is the connection weight between the input layer and the
hidden layer. The output of hidden layer is

2.3. Hydrocarbon detection using multi-attributes fusion based quantum
neural networks
Different seismic attributes may reﬂect the different information of
the seismic data related to the structure, stratigraphy, lithology and hy-
drocarbons. For a speciﬁc gas reservoir, the seismic attributes should be
selected carefully according to the sensitivity of different work areas and
different reservoirs to the seismic attributes of the predicted objects. In
seismic attributes, the relative wave impedance features may reﬂect the
lithological changes. The local wave decomposition based seismic
attenuation characteristics are related to the hydrocarbon contents. Data
clustering results of prestack seismic data are the sum of the appearances
of sedimentary facies on a seismic section to a certain degree, and they
represent the lithological assemblage, bedding, and sedimentary char-
acteristics of the sediments that give rise to its reﬂections. Therefore, for
effectively distinguishing the weak responses of the gas reservoir, we
mainly select the relative wave impedance features, the local wave
decomposition based seismic attenuation characteristics and data clus-
tering results of prestack seismic data as the featured seismic attributes

for training the QGSNN. Relative seismic impedances of the far and near
offset trace stacked proﬁles are extracted at ﬁrst. For the local wave
decomposition based seismic attenuation estimation, we mainly select
the CEEMD-based attenuation gradient estimation method ((Xue et al.,
2016a) and the wavelet-based cepstrum decomposition method (Xue
et al., 2016b). Based on the difference volume between the far and near
offset trace stacked proﬁles, we extract the difference volume between
the ﬁrst-order and second-order of the wavelet-based cepstrum, and the
CEEMD-based attenuation gradient volume. Seismic data clustering
using Self-Organization Map (SOM) neural network for the difference
proﬁle is also used. Principal component analysis (PCA) is then used to
these seismic attributes to decrease the data dimension. Subsequently, for
the obtained principal components, we transform them into quantum
state representations. Assume the seismic attributes set being X ¼
ðx1; x2; ⋯; xnÞT; ðxi 2 ½ai;bi�Þ, in which xi denotes one seismic attribute in
its ranges from ai to bi. Now let θi ¼ 2πðxi�aiÞ

set by

Next, the error value of the neural network is calculated, and an error

parameters. The error value of the neural network is deﬁned as

where ~yk is the expectant output.
Since there is a large number of minimum values in the quantum
neural network, in order to improve the search effects, the particle swarm
optimization (PSO) is used to calculate the bias matrices θ of the hidden
layer and φ of the network output layer in the quantum neural network.
The global search method is used to optimize the parameters of the
QGSNN. Furthermore, based on the global search, gradient decreased
method is employed to ﬁnd the optimal solution of the bias matrices θ of
the hidden layer and φ of the network output layer in the quantum neural
network for decreasing the network error continuously. According to the
gradient decreased method, the update of the rotation angle of each layer

After we get the trained parameters fθ;φ;Efinalg, in which Efinal denotes
the ﬁnal E, hydrocarbon detections for the seismic sections are carried
out by using these trained parameters. The workﬂow of the multi-
attributes fusion based quantum neural networks is shown in Fig. 2.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Results
The search effects of the PSO and the QGSNN are respectively shown
in Figs. 3 and 4. The near and far offset trace stacked sections intersecting
well A are shown in Fig. 5. Different seismic attributes for seismic sec-
tions intersecting well A are shown in Fig. 6. A comparison results of the
QGSNN and the conventional BP for hydrocarbon detection are shown in
Fig. 7. Note that the same workﬂow as in Fig. 2 is used here to replace the
QGSNN with the BP. For further testing the proposed method, analysis on
the near and far offset trace stacked sections intersecting well B (Fig. 8a
and b) is also given in detail. Different seismic attributes for seismic
sections intersecting well B are shown in Fig. 8c~h. The comparison
results of the QGSNN and the conventional BP for hydrocarbon detection
for section intersecting well B are shown in Fig. 9.
3.2. Data analysis
3.2.1. Searching performance of the QGSNN
The parameters used in our multi-attributes fusion based QGSNN
workﬂow are as follows: number of hidden neurons:10; The maximum
number of iterations:10000; number of particle swarm:40; particle
maximum ﬂight speed:1; maximum iteration step of particle swarm:200;
learning rate: 0.01.
Here, we take the seismic sections intersecting well A for analysing
the searching performance of the QGSNN. As Fig. 3 shows, the variance
of the minimum error of neural networks got by the PSO is 39.2. The PSO
gives the global optimal values of the bias matrices θ of the hidden layer
and φ of the network output layer. The QGSNN further gives the local
optimal values of the bias matrices θ of the hidden layer and φ of the
network output layer (Fig. 4). As Fig. 4 shows, the error variance after
neural network training by the gradient decreased method is 36.2.
Combined with the PSO, the error variance of the QGSNN is further
decreased, and the search effects are improved.
3.2.2. Seismic attributes analysis
For seismic sections intersecting well A, as shown in Fig. 5, there are
weak seismic responses existed at the gas area between the horizontal
lines H1 and H2, and strong seismic responses existed at the poor gas, gas
and water area between the horizontal lines H3 and H4. Fig. 6 shows the
different seismic attributes volumes. From Fig. 6 one can ﬁnd that in the
difference section between the far and near offset trace stacked sections
intersecting well A (Fig. 6a), the weak seismic responses existed at the gas
area between the horizontal lines H1 and H2 are enhanced. Data clus-
tering results (Fig. 6b) show that there are some different data charac-
teristics for the two reservoir areas. The areas where poor gas, gas and
water are located have more data clustering types than the weak
responses-exhibited gas area. Relative seismic impedances of the near

and far offset trace stacked proﬁles (Fig. 6c and d) show there are rela-
tively low values existed at the area where poor gas, gas and water are
located and medium amplitudes existed at the weak responses-exhibited
gas area. The instantaneous amplitude volume (Fig. 6e) and the peak
amplitude volume above the average (Fig. 6f) show there are larger
amplitudes existed in the areas where poor gas, gas and water are
located, and no obvious amplitude anomalies in the weak responses-
exhibited gas area. The CEEMD-based attenuation gradient volume
(Fig. 6g) gives the similar interpretation results and it only detects the
reservoir located at the poor gas, gas and water bearing areas. The dif-
ference section between the ﬁrst-order and second-order of the wavelet-
based cepstrum (Fig. 6h) shows there are obvious amplitude anomalies
existed in the weak responses-exhibited gas area and the areas where
poor gas, gas and water are located. As Fig. 6 shows, we can ﬁnd that
there is not one seismic attribute which can gives the accurate
hydrocarbon-prone interpretation especially for the weak responses-
exhibited gas area. Therefore, according the different detection ability
of the different seismic attributes, we mainly select the data clustering
volume, relative seismic impedances of the near and far offset trace
stacked proﬁles, the CEEMD-based seismic attenuation gradient volume
and the difference section between the ﬁrst-order and second-order of the
wavelet-based
cepstrum
for
further
hydrocarbon
detection
using
QGSNN.
The selected attributes are further used for another near and far offset
trace stacked sections intersecting well B (Fig. 8a and b). There are three
gas areas located between the horizontal lines H3 and H4. Stronger
reﬂection amplitudes are mainly existed at the third reservoir area
marked by the pink ellipse, and weak seismic responses are found at the
Fig. 5. The near (a) and far (b) offset trace stacked sections intersecting well A.

ﬁrst and second reservoir areas marked by the pink ellipses. Fig. 8c~h
shows the selected seismic attributes for further QGSNN prediction. The
selected data clustering volume (Fig. 8d) shows that there are different
data characteristics existed for the three gas-bearing areas. The relative
seismic impedances of the near and far offset trace stacked proﬁles
(Fig. 8e and f) show that relatively low values are existed for the ﬁrst and
third gas-bearing areas, and no obvious characteristics can be found in
the second gas-bearing area. The CEEMD-based seismic attenuation
gradient volume (Fig. 8g) shows that there are some little stronger
amplitude anomalies existed in the three gas-bearing areas. The differ-
ence section between the ﬁrst-order and second-order of the wavelet-
based cepstrum (Fig. 8h) targets the gas reservoir well but it cannot
distinguish the different reservoirs. Therefore, when the PCA results of
these selected seismic attributes are used, the main contributor
components will be used for further improving the hydrocarbon de-
tections using QGSNN.
3.2.3. Hydrocarbon detection
For hydrocarbon detection for seismic section intersecting well A, we
can ﬁnd that most conventional seismic attributes (Fig. 6) are unable to
give a gas-prone interpretation for the weak responses-exhibited gas area
located between the horizontal lines H1 and H2. For improving the hy-
drocarbon detection ability, PCA combined with QGSNN are used for
hydrocarbon detection. As Fig. 7a shows, strong amplitude anomalies are
existed in the weak responses-exhibited gas area between H1 and H2 and
the areas where poor gas, gas and water are located between H3 and H4.
QGSNN targets the reservoir accurately and gives a good hydrocarbon-
prone interpretation. Compared with the conventional BP method, the

hydrocarbon detection ability especially for the weak responses-
exhibited gas area is highly improved by using QGSNN.
For further testing the ability of the multi-attributes based QGSNN,
the seismic sections intersecting well B are used. Based on the selected
seismic attributes volumes (Fig. 8), the PSO-assisted QGSNN combined
with PCA is applied (Fig. 9a). A bit strong amplitude anomaly is found in
the ﬁrst gas-bearing area marked by the pink ellipse, and strong ampli-
tude anomalies are found in the second and third gas-bearing areas
marked by the pink ellipses. The hydrocarbon detection using the con-
ventional BP method is also given in Fig. 9b. Strong amplitude anomalies
can be found at the area near the well B between the horizontal lines H1
and H3 where there is no gas production. Compared with the conven-
tional BP method, the QGSNN targets the reservoirs more accurately and
gives the distinguished interpretation results for the three gas-bearing
areas.
4. Conclusions
Hydrocarbon detection using a multi-attributes based quantum neu-
ral network for a tight sandstone gas reservoir in the Sichuan Basin,
China is mainly studied in this paper. For hydrocarbon detections, the
relative wave impedance features, the local wave decomposition based
seismic attenuation characteristics and data clustering results of prestack
seismic data are selected as the featured seismic attributes. For the local
wave decomposition based seismic attenuation characteristics, the
CEEMD-based attenuation gradient estimation method and the wavelet-
based cepstrum decomposition method are mainly used. Combined with
PCA of the selected featured seismic attributes, the PSO-assisted QGSNN
is applied to the data acquired from the tight sandstone gas reservoir in
the Sichuan Basis. Application results show that the proposed method is
capable for detecting the weak responses-exhibited gas area where the
seismic attributes and the conventional BP methods give the poor gas-
prone interpretations.
