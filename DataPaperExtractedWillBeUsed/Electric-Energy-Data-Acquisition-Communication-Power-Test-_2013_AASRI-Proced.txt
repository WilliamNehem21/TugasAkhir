1. Introduction 
Smart electricity application and electric energy data acquisition has become an important part of China's 
smart grid construction. And smart electricity application is physically based on the electricity data acquisition 
system. It likes an interactive bridge between power supply enterprise and the user. 
In the interacting process of electric energy data acquisition system, the remote channel and local channel 
has to communicate many times. Especially when local channel needs repeaters for network, the 
communication becomes more frequently. The communication means of smart energy meters applied in 
power grid, includes a low voltage power line carrier, micro-power wireless communication module, RS485 
bus communication, and so on. Communication modules have a variety of products, uneven quality, and 
different work power consumption.

2. Author Artwork 
Power user electric energy data acquire system local channel have two main implementations, including 
micro power wireless and power line carrier communication technology. For the two communication 
technology, external communication performance and the dynamic power condition of communication are 
closely related. 
The energy communication module is powered by the meter power module. Therefore, when the power 
consumption of the communication module becomes too large, it will directly affect on the normal work of 
electric energy meter, and affect on the entire system. 
When communication power consumption is too large, the impact might be interested in the 
electromagnetic environment, and increased space electromagnetic field or the influence of power quality. 
Because of the very large communication activities, power consumption of each communication should 
limited under a certain value. Otherwise it will cause a large waste of electric energy.

Conversely, if the power of communication module is designed too small, the communication performance 
can’t produce enough power which communications needs, and ensure the reliability of communication in the 
physical environment. 
This paper introduces the power carrier power test instrument can accurately measure the concentrator, 
collector and electric power carrier communication module in the current, voltage, power under different 
working condition data.

4. Design of the Test System 
To test the power of measured power line carrier module, when sending data, receiving data and static state 
power, a MCU and carrier module UART interface communication have been designed , for exchange the 
carrier module state. The measuring device is divided into 4 parts, respectively is control and storage section, 
measurement section, testing section, power system.

4.1.  Testing section 
Testing section provides 3 module testing positions, each for the concentrator carrier module, three-phase 
meter carrier module, single-phase meter or collector carrier module. In order to reflect the real measured 
carrier module power characteristics, this system needs a high speed, and high precision sampling. The

When electric energy data acquisition exchange data in the local interaction, every way of communication 
must followed by the communication protocol DL/T 645. Communication time is about several hundred 
milliseconds, considering the communication data frame length, relay data and communication in the process 
of error correcting code and other factors.

From formula (1) and (2), 1 kHz sampling frequency is sufficient to ensure the signal without distortion. 
4.2.  Measuring Section 
The measurement section is controlled by a microcontroller, which measures the current and voltage in 
real-time. This part is the key part of the measurement apparatus. With the control of the microcontroller chip 
CS5550, ADR431 and an analog switch 74HC4052, measuring section collects the current, voltage real-time 
acquisition.  
CS5550 Cirrus Logic chip contains two 
-
 A/D converter (ADC) and a highly integrated serial 
interface 
-
 A/D converter. One ADC interface of CS5550 for measuring carrier module current, is 
connected to the output of 74HC4052. Another ADC interface for measuring carrier module voltage, through 
the divider resistance means, is connected to power supply of the carrier module. CS5550 serial interface is 
connected to the SPI of the MCU. 
ADR431BR is a high accuracy 2.5V voltage reference source, produced by ANALOG DEVICE company. 
It has high accuracy, low noise and low temperature drift properties. While CS5550 has a 2.5V benchmark 
itself, but its accuracy and temperature drift can’t meet the requirements. The ADR431 outputs a 2.5V 
benchmark for CS5550 precision measurement. 
74HC4052D is a 4 anthology 1 an analog switch, powered by ± 5V supply, with low to 60 ohm resistance. 
74HC4052D is controlled by MCU, a time-division switching 3 ways power carrier wave module current 
signal (converted to voltage) to CS5550. 
4.3.  Control and Storage Section 
Control and storage section is the measuring device controlling center. The center is responsible for 
CS5550 measurement control, data storage, power line carrier communication module and communication 
with PC. The segment also includes LPC2378 and IS63WV1288. 
LPC2378 uses the ARM7TDMI nucleus, with 4 UART, two SSP interface, two 64K address space, the 
width of the data bus is 8 bits of asynchronous memory interface, USB, Ethernet interface, two 64K space to 
the external memory interface can access a 128KByte external memory. 
4 UART interface are respectively connected with the 3 electric power carrier communication module and 
PC. Connected to the concentrator carrier module UART is used to simulate the concentrator communication 
256  
 Hongliang Sun et al. /  AASRI Procedia  4 ( 2013 )  250 – 260 
protocol. Connected to the three-phase ammeter carrier module UART is used to simulate of three-phase 
electricity meter communication protocol. Connected to the collector of the carrier communication module is 
used to simulate collector acquisition communication protocol. The UART connected to the PC completes the 
instruction interaction with PC, which control the measurement and reading of the measured data. 
LPC2378 is a SSP interface which connected to the CS5550, controls measurement of timing and reading 
of the measured results. 
IS63WV1288 is a SRAM with 128Kbyte. LPC2378 is connected to the 8 bit asynchronous interface, for 
the preservation of measurement data in the testing process. 
4.4.  Power supply section 
Power section is responsible for producing the different voltage which required, such as 8~18V, 5V, 3.3V, 
-5V voltage, and ensure that there is enough power for needs. 
In order to measure the electric power carrier wave module in its normal voltage range of the working state 
and power, the potentiometer circuit is designed for regulating carrier module working voltage. And the 
adjusting range is 8~18V. 
5. Software Implementation 
   A reliable and stable operating system is essential, in order to ensure the measurement device for the 
operation in a good order and well arranged. 
   The measuring device of MCU uses UC/OS-II system. UC/OS II (Micro Control Operation System Two) 
is a based on the ROM operation, which can be trimmed, preemptive real-time kernel, with a high degree of 
portability, particularly suited to the microprocessor and a controller. It has an nice operating system 
performance for the real-time operating system (RTOS). 
In order to realize its function, this system sets 5 tasks, such as the CS5550 control task, PC interaction 
task, three-phase electricity meter simulation task, the concentrator simulation task and collector / single-
phase meter task. 
5.1. CS5550 Control Task 
   In consideration of the real-time accurate to obtain the voltage and current transient data, the sampling 
rate required to achieve the 1 kHz, and consecutive sampling 15S, the software must be used by way of 
interruption. At the same time, the software will complete the 1 kHz sampling and ensure the serial work 
properly, so the software should be designed read the sampling data in the interrupt. 
The CS5550 control uses a task under the interrupt mode, shown in flow chart 2. 
The CS5550 task is first configured for a second sampled only 1 time. This can guarantee the updated 
every second voltage data, but also can give the MCU burden.When high speed sampling, the CS5550 is 
configured for a second sampled 1000 times, and start the sampling and interrupt. Then, the process goes to 
interrupt. In the interrupt, data is read and stored in the external memory. When the sampling number 
specified number, it will stop the interrupt, send a measurement end signal.    At the start of high speed 
sampling, CS5550 task have to wait for the end signal. After getting the signal, it will notify the PC, and 
CS5550 will be reconfigured as a second sampling time again. After receiving the corrected signal, it will stop 
the interrupt, and start the calibration. After being read from interrupt, calibration data will be stored in the 
flash (that is not lost after power off).

5.2. PC interaction Tasks 
    This part of task completes instruction interaction between MCU and PC UART, and read the data. This 
part is to take the way of combining tasks and interrupt, seeing in figure 3. 
    PC interaction tasks in serial initialization, by blocking the way for collection of data receive mailbox. In 
the interrupt, when receiving data, it will judge whether it has a frame header and a tail sign, for combination 
a complete data packet. After receipt of a complete data packet, it will be sent to a data receive mailbox. 
When PC interaction task receives a data mail, PC will make a CRC trading, and then parses the command 
word, finally give the response, sent to PC. 
 
Fig. 6. Flow Chart of PC Interaction Tasks 
5.3. Concentrator Simulation Task 
    The task simulation concentrator sends the data to concentrator carrier module, and triggers the carrier 
module in the transmit state, to measure the power characteristics. The way using tasks with interrupt mode is 
similar and PC interaction task. Collector and meter simulation task is using a similar way to simulation.
