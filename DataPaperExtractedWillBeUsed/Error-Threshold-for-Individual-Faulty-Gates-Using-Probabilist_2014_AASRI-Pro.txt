Abstract 
In the progression from CMOS technology to nanotechnology, being able to assess reliability of nano-based electronic 
circuits is fast becoming necessary. Due to this phenomenon, several computational-based approaches have been proposed 
for the reliability assessment of nanotechnology-based circuit systems. In quantifying reliability measure of the desired 
circuit system, faulty gates are considered as the most active part of the system. To have reliable circuit system, apart from 
its faulty gates, the size of error, p, in those faulty gates has to be lesser than a threshold, �*. In other words, for the 
individual faulty gates to function reliably, the parameter interval of error in those faulty gates has to be 0 � p < �*, based 
on their respective gate error thresholds. This hypothesized that reliability of the desired circuit system does not only 
depend on its faulty gates, but it also depends on the error threshold of those faulty gates above which no reliable 
computation is possible. Therefore, there is a need to compute the exact error thresholds for individual faulty gates above 
which no circuit made up using those gates can calculate reliably. This paper shows the employment of Probabilistic 
Transfer Matrix (PTM) model in deriving the exact error threshold for individual faulty gates. The employed methodology 
provides simple and powerful analytic method to analyze reliability measure of nanotechnology-based circuit systems.

1. Introduction 
As CMOS technology scales down to nanometric scale, inconsistency in transistor performance will 
continue to increase, making the transistors less and less reliable.  
This occurrence will subsequently affect the performance and downgrade the reliability of the desired 
circuit system made-up of these transistors [1]. Inconsistencies in the performance of transistors occur due to 
manufacturing ambiguity in the CMOS production process. Due to this physical-level of characteristics,     
non-deterministic behaviors will continue to develop in the circuit system which naturally affects the evolving 
technologies to have restrictions to operate reliably. Therefore, reliability has turn out to be the most 
important subject in the design entry of circuit systems and thus offer new challengers to circuit designers. 
Various probabilistic design methodologies have been implemented to assemble reliable circuit systems built 
out using unreliable devices [2, 3]. Due to the demand of having reliable design, a number of computational 
methodologies have been also proposed to assess reliability of nanotechnology-based circuits [4-12]. They are 
Probabilistic Transfer Matrix (PTM) [4-7], Probabilistic Gate Model (PGM) [8-10], Boolean Difference-
based Error Calculator (BDEC) [11] and Bayesian Network (BN) [12].  
Reliability of a desired circuit system is not only affected by its faulty gates, but it also depends on the size 
of the error, p, in those faulty gates. In order for the system to be reliable, the size of the error in its faulty 
gates has to be lesser than a threshold, �*. The upper-limit of error in those faulty gates is increasingly 
important subject to be considered in the fault tolerance computation as it provides the exact bounds above 
which no circuit made up using those faulty gates can compute reliably. For this purpose, we have shown here 
that apart from computing reliability of the desired circuit system, Probabilistic Transfer Matrix (PTM) has 
also the ability to compute the fundamental error threshold for individual faulty gates.  
Section 2 outlines Probabilistic Transfer Matrix (PTM). Section 3 exhibits the employment of PTM in 
deriving the exact error threshold for individual faulty gates. Extensive simulation results and discussion are 
shown in Section 4. The paper is concluded in Section 5.  
2. Probabilistic Transfer Matrix (PTM) 
A relationship between input and output values for the operation of an integrated nano-based electronic 
circuit can be characterized by its truth table. Under certain circumstances, an incorrect output value can be 
generated by its input value. If we can identify how frequent this phenomenon is likely to occur, then we can 
demonstrate this occurrence using Probabilistic Transfer Matrix (PTM) [4-7]. PTM is represented in matrix 
form where column and row indicate input and output values respectively. For demonstration purpose, PTM 
for a two-input AND gate is shown in Eq. 1. The symbol p in Eq. 1 denotes the probability for wrong output 
value; sometimes we can also refer p as gate error probability. For a logic gate with p = 0, its PTM is termed 
as Ideal Transfer Matrix (ITM), in which the correct output value for that gate to occur, is assigned with a 
probability of 1. Eq. 2 shows the ITM matrix for AND logic gate.

Probabilistic Transfer Matrix (PTM) and Ideal Transfer Matrix (ITM) can represent any components from 
the desired circuit. These components can be divided into three special classes of gates namely standalone 
wires (uncorrelated), fan-out gates and swap of wires (correlated) as shown in [6].  
 
�
Standalone wire has no errors and denoted as 2 x 2 Identity Matrix, I.  
�
Fan-out gate refers to a gate where its output is associated to more than one input of the next gates. This 
gate is represented as Fn, where it feeds an output signal to n inputs of the next gates. Fig. 1 shows the F2 
involving NAND gates. Its matrix representation is shown in Eq. 3.  
�
Swap of wires refers to crossing of wires. Fig. 2, Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 show swap of two-wires with one 
crossing point, swap of three-wires with one crossing point and swap of three-wires with two crossing 
points respectively. In respective ways the swap of wires are shown in Eq. 4, Eq. 5 and Eq. 6.

There are two different types of connection for components in the desired circuit; either serially or 
parallelly as shown in Fig. 5. For a serial connection, circuit PTM is obtained as the product of PTM matrices 
for individual components as shown in Fig. 5(a). For a parallel connection, circuit PTM is obtained as the 
tensor product of PTM matrices for individual components as shown in Fig. 5(b) [4-7].

3. System Design 
Using the built-in feature of PTM, it can be hypothesized that reliability of the desired circuit system does 
not only depend on its faulty gates, but also on the error thresholds of those faulty gates above which no 
reliable computation is possible. For this purpose, PTM is employed to compute the exact error thresholds for 
individual noisy gates. In this approach, von-Neumann model has been considered. According to the model, 
the worst scenario in computing circuit reliability is attained when two input signals for a logic gate have 
same likelihood of being ‘1’ [8].  
To determine the exact error threshold for NAND gate, PTM model is applied to a series of NAND gates 
as shown in Fig. 6. In this series of NAND gates, its order is labelled by index j, j = 1, 2, 3, ….., k, …., where 
the output signal of gate j converts to an input signal of gate j + 1.  For any stationary p value, 0 < p � 0.5, 
one randomly chooses an initial value of X1 (likelihood of input signal being ‘1’). The likelihood of output 
signal being ‘1’ is computed for next stages until a sufficiently large number of stages are analyzed. This 
process of iteration is continued until the likelihood of output signal being ‘1’ converges to some fixed 
attractors. The attractors can be in the form of 
 
• a point for that specific p, 
 
• a number of distinct points for that specific p, 
 
• or chaos. 
 
Once fixed attractors are obtained, those fixed attractors are plotted against each value of p as shown in Fig. 
7 for NAND gate. By applying the same procedure on a series of other gates, one can obtain similar kind of 
graph plots as demonstrated in Fig. 8, Fig. 9 and Fig.10 for NOR, XOR and NOT gates respectively.

From the graph plots, when error in the faulty gate, p < maximum error threshold, then the gates can 
function reliably based on its even and odd numbers of logic gates. When error in the faulty gate p > 
maximum error threshold, then the output signal can be explained as neither being ‘1’ nor ‘0’. From Fig. 7 
and Fig. 8, both NAND and NOR faulty gates share the same error threshold which is < 0.1. This 
phenomenon happened because the NOR gate is a duality of the NAND gate, so their behaviors, illustrated by 
Fig. 7 and Fig. 8, come out to be complementary to one another. For XOR gate in Fig. 9, its maximum error 
threshold is 0, or in other words a maximum error threshold never occurs for this gate. For NOR gate in     Fig. 
10, its maximum error threshold is < 3 x 10-3. Based on PTM approach, among all the faulty gates, NAND 
and NOR gates give the highest error threshold, followed by NOT gate and then by XOR gate. This indicates 
that from all the existing faulty gates, NAND and NOR gates would be preferably used the most in designing 
a circuit system due to their highest error threshold compare to other faulty gates. 
5. Conclusion 
Reliability is fast becoming a critical subject in the design entry of nanotechnology-based circuits.  Due to 
this occurrence, various computational-based approaches have been proposed to assess reliability of these 
circuit systems. Apart from assessing reliability, in this paper we briefly present an analytical approach based 
on Probabilistic Transfer Matrix (PTM) on how to derive exact error thresholds for general probabilistic 
computation.  Exact error thresholds for faulty gates are significantly important subject to be considered in the 
designing nano-based circuit systems as it provides the exact bounds above which no reliable calculation is 
achievable.
