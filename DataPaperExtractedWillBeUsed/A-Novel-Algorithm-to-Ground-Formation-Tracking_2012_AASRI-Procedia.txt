Abstract 
A logical method of ground formation target tracking, which includes formation initiation, formation separation, 
formation merging and formation updating, is proposed according to the kinetics of formation moving. The method 
addresses the problem of multi-targets tracking as a whole by using the centre -based tracking approach in the process of 
track updating. Therefore, it is practicable due to reducing the computational burden and saving system resources.

1. Introduction 
A group of targets are required to keep in a formation for tactical purposes or task requirements, such as a 
robot formation, an aircraft formation, a satellite formation and a vehicle formation. The method of formation 
target tracking and controlling can reduce the system cost, increase the system robustness and efficiency. 
Therefore, it has reconfiguration ability and structure flexibility for the system. Formation control has wide 
applications, for example, security patrols, search and rescue in hazardous environment, area coverage and 
reconnaissance in military tasks (Chen and Wang, 2005).  
The problem of tracking ground formation targets including military equipments and civil vehicles is more 
difficult than that of tracking air targets. This is because of a relatively close distance between ground targets,

the movement uncertainty and the complexity of radar echoes’ environment. Bar-Shalom et al. (Bar-Shalom, 
1978; Bar-Shalom et al., 2001) proposed the concept of “clutter” and treated a “clutter” as a group, and had 
done a lot of research. In recent years, formation tracking and controlling technology has gradually become a 
very active research topic with broad applications in the formation of aerospace, robotics, marine vessels and 
ground vehicles. 
A logical method of formation target tracking, which includes formation initiation, formation separation, 
formation merging and formation updating, is proposed according to the kinetics of formation moving. A FC-
IMM-UPF algorithm is applied to address formation target tracking (Bilik I and Tabrikian J, 2010; Ronghua G, 
etl., 2007). 
2. A method of formation tracking 
2.1. The maintenance of a formation 
Formation target tracking maintenance can choose the minimum bounding rectangle and the minimum 
circumscribed circle of formation or the geometry centre of the smallest closures, and use the geometric 
centre tracking method to track and maintain formations. When formation combining, we can amend the 
geometric centre of the formation. Because when a new target enters, the correlated area of formation target 
will change. If we continue to use the original centre, it is inaccurate to track new formation targets. Therefore, 
we should amend the centre of new formation targets. Then we take the minimum bounding rectangle of 
formation target as an example, and describe the identification and evolutionary relationships of formation 
spatial structure in detail. For the bounding rectangle of formation targets, length and width always remain 
parallel to respectively X-axis and Y-axis of Cartesian coordinate system. 
1. Determine target prediction of the minimum bounding rectangle. Whether multiple targets are in a 
straight line or not, the processing approach is the same for three or more targets. A formation is assumed to 
be composed of N targets, and their geometric centre is shown in Fig. 1. The 2-D Cartesian coordinates 
position vectors of N targets are denoted respectively as T1(x1, y1), …, Ti(xi, yi), …, TN(xN, yN). The four 
vertices of the minimum rectangle of target predicted positions are denoted respectively as A(xa, ya), B(xb, yb), 
C(xc, yc) and D(xd, yd), and the centre is denoted as O(xO, yO). Then,

Starting from time k, the estimated position of the centre will move from Ok to Ok+1 when the formation 
forwards a time step T. The predicted minimum enclosing rectangle centre of a formation at time k+1 is 
denoted as Ok+1(xO, k+1, yO, k+1). The evolution of the prediction centre of a formation is shown in Fig. 2. 
Fig. 2.  The evolution of the prediction centre of a formation 
Under the premise of maintaining the stability of spatial structure in the continuous tracking phase, the 
tracking approach based on minimum enclosing rectangle centre of a formation based is applied to predict the 
rectangular centre at time k+1. Then, the estimated position vector of each target at time k+1 is calculated by 
the measurement of the minimum enclosing rectangle centre at time k+1, the prediction Ok+1(xO,k+1, yO,k+1) at 
time k+1, and the corresponding relationship between the centre and all targets in the formation.

5. Deal with the target measurement. Similar to deal with the target prediction, the measurements are 
processed as follows. The minimum enclosing rectangle and its centre are determined at first; then the 
corresponding relationship between the centre and all measurements in the formation.  
2.2. The separation and combination of a formation 
The separation and combination of a formation both belong to the formation logical process. To describe 
the algorithm of the formation separation and combination, some symbols are defined in Table 2.

Fj (r) and Tj (di)
Tj (r), we separate the target i from the formation and make it forms a new 
target, which will be involved in the combination process. 
(2) If the extrapolation tracking times of targets in formation go beyond the fixed value 
(NoRelationCounter(i) 
 m or Tj (di)
Tj (r)), we separate the target from the formation and drop it.

(1) Initialize the formation, ensuring that every formation only correlates a target. 
(2) If a new target is discovered, we compute the shortest distance between the new target and the centre of 
all the tracking formation min{Fj* (dl)}.If min{Fj* (dl)}
Fj (r)
we append this target to the closest formation. 
Otherwise, we consider the target as a new formation, and the new target will be created by the slide window 
algorithm or the separation of the formation.

3. Simulation and analysis 
The algorithm is used to process maintaining of tracking to formation state, the augment of new target (the 
combination of formation) and the loss of target (the separation of formation). The formation tracking and 
multiple targets tracking methods are applied to deal with a tracking instance respectively, and analyze how 
the number of targets can affect the two different tracking methods. A CV and a CT model is used as the 
target movement model (Ronghua G, etl., 2007).  
3.1. Simulation 
The targets in formation do snake-like mobile. When the formation target has moved for 20s, the new 
target (target 5) appears, and joins into the formation, which is shown in Fig. 3(a).When it has moved for 100s, 
the target 5 disappears from the formation, which is shown in Fig. 3(b). For the formation tracking algorithm, 
the number of particle N=200, the particle number of every model is set as 100.

3.2. The computational complexity 
In order to analyze how the number of formation target and the tracking methods (formation target tracking 
and multiple target tracking) can affect the time complexity, we set the number of formation target as five, ten 
and fifteen, computing the single-step computing time of target tracking respectively, which is shown as 
Table 2.The formation target tracking adopts the formation tracking algorithm, while the multiple target 
tracking adopts the multitarget tracking algorithm. When the number of targets is 5, the single-step computing 
time of multiple target tracking is 3.54 times of the formation target tracking. When the number is 10, the 
single-step computing time of multiple target tracking is 5.18 times of the formation target tracking. When the 
number of target is 15, the single-step computing time of multiple target tracking is 6.12 times of the 
formation target tracking. So it is clear that, as the increase of the targets number, the efficiency of formation 
tracking is higher. And compared with the multiple targets tracking, the advantage of formation tracking is 
obvious.

4. Conclusion 
We propose a FC-IMM-UPF formation target tracking algorithm based on geometric centre. In the 
engineering practice, this algorithm can implement the integrated tracking to the multiple targets. When 
targets join or lose, it can also work normally.
