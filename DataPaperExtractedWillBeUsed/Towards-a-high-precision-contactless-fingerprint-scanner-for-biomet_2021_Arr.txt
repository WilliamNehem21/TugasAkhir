The raging COVID-19 pandemic accentuates the urgent and compelling need for non-contact fingerprinting 
biometric authentication devices to mitigate the transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coro-
navirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and other contagious infections. Current approaches to contactless fingerprinting 
scanners suffer limitations ranging from poor compatibility with two-dimensional equivalent touch-based 
fingerprint images to perspective distortions, inconstant resolution, motion blur images and low correlation 
factors. Herein, these constraints are tackled by implementing a system that enables the positioning of the target 
finger(s) at fixed vertical and horizontal distances away from the camera lens without the physical contact of the 
fingers with the device framework during scanning. A high-precision fingerprint pattern recognition of up to 
97.51% correlation factor has been achieved, using this contactless method, by varying the background illu-
minating light and implementing two-dimensional imaging techniques and near-constant resolution. Addition-
ally, a convenient contactless fingerprint acquisition process is reinforced through a unique architectural design.

1. Introduction 
There is an urgent and growing need, in today’s rapidly changing and 
disease-prone world, for non-contact biometric authentication devices 
to aid hygiene and safety, and mitigate the spread of contagious in-
fections [1]. Fingerprint biometrics is one of the most widely used forms 
of recognition for the purposes of identification and authentication due 
to its convenience, reliability and accuracy but it is also one of the most 
susceptible agents of transmission for contagious infections [43]. This 
drawback is especially accentuated, now, in the wake of the recent 
emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2) [3]. 
Prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, however, efforts had 
been on-going towards the development of contactless fingerprint bio-
metric scanners mainly because of the limitations of touch-based 
fingerprint scanners. Some of the limitations of these scanners, which 
operate on optical or capacitive systems, include: non-linear distortions; 
introduced by the elastic deformation of the skin during scans, irregular 
attributes associated with dry skin, diseases, sweat, dirt and humidity, 
security issues; with latent fingerprints deposited on the scan plate after 
each use, which can be fraudulently replicated, and inconsistent pres-
sures of the fingers during scans, amongst others [4–8]. 
It is noteworthy that contactless fingerprint scanners have been 
previously developed [9–11] but have suffered some underlying chal-
lenges, such as: inefficient fingerprint acquisition techniques, ineffective 
approaches to reconciling differences between the salient features of the 
images captured by touch-based fingerprint devices and those captured 
via contactless fingerprint devices, and the adaptability of the contact-
less fingerprint system to the automated fingerprint identification sys-
tem (AFIS); commonly used in the touch-based (contact) method of 
fingerprinting [9–13]. 
Two approaches have been reported for contactless fingerprint 
acquisition, namely: two-dimensional (2-D) and three-dimensional (3-

D) imaging techniques. The 2-D method uses a single camera to capture 
images whereas the 3-D technique employs multiple cameras, which 
require the superimposition of images and use of complex algorithms 
[14–16]. The available contactless fingerprint 2-D scanners are, how-
ever, limited by their fingerprint acquisition styles. They are also 
affected by background illumination variations and reflections thereby 
producing poor resolution fingerprint images [17,19,44]. Unsurpris-
ingly, most of the existing contactless fingerprint scanners deploy the 
3-D technique to capture more detailed fingerprints. 
The 3-D approach emphasizes on gathering more details of the 
fingerprint by incorporating the dimensions in the x, y, z axis. The 
various 3-D image acquisition techniques are multiple-view setup, 
structured lights or photometric stereo methods [45]. Unfortunately, the 
additional details introduce errors of perspective distortions and 
inconstant resolution, which reduce the correlation factors. The problem 
is evident in the computation of touch-equivalent fingerprints from 3-D 
to 2-D images [21–23]. Similarly, the absorption of light by the skin’s 
epidermis during finger scans reduces the resolution of the images 
produced via the contactless method. 
The acceptable standard for the matching and verification of 
fingerprinting patterns is governed by the automated fingerprint iden-
tification systems (AFIS), which makes it mandatory for acquired 
fingerprint images, whether 2-D or 3-D, to be converted to the equiva-
lent touch fingerprint 2-D images, described as touch-equivalent images 
(TEI), for uniformity and compatibility [24–26,46]. It is notable that 
available contactless fingerprint scanners use neural network classifiers 
to reconstruct the generated three-dimensional images to equivalent 
two-dimensional touch images. 
The correlation factor is a key factor in the evaluation of the per-
formance of fingerprint scanners [28]. It is a percentage measure of how 
the enrolled fingerprint image matches the one captured during verifi-
cation. It is therefore crucial for the enrolled true fingerprint images, 
with the extracted unique minutiae features of ridges and valleys, to 
match the captured fingerprint images at the point of verification 
[28–32]. This is termed pattern recognition. 
Several strategies have been implemented towards improving the 
correlation factors of contactless fingerprint scanners compared to 
touch-based fingerprint scanners, such as the introduction of back-
ground subtraction and contextual filtering algorithms [33] but most 
contactless fingerprint systems exploit resolution normalization, which 
involves adopting a constant resizing factor based on the estimated 
distance between the lens camera and target finger, placed for scanning 
[34]. 
It is pertinent to point out that in the touch-based fingerprint scan-
ners, where there is elastic deformation of the finger skin, for instance, 
during scans due to pressure, the elastic deformation is compensated for 
during verification thereby nullifying the error initially introduced 
during enrollment by the same user. Consequently, the fingerprints 
captured during verification match the enrolled fingerprints. However, 
where enrollment is done using a touch-based fingerprint scanner but 
verification is with a contactless fingerprint scanner, the errors due to 
elastic deformation become consequential; leading to a mismatch and 
poor correlation factor as the captured contactless fingerprints lack the 
elastic deformation distortions elicited by a touch-based fingerprint 
scanner. 
Furthermore, the scanning of multiple fingers simultaneously is re-
ported to enhance correlation factor and reduce false positive errors 
[10]. Generally, the method of coalescing multiple fingers presents 
features, which make sampling and pattern recognition more precise 
[14]. Nevertheless, multiple-finger scanners require more space and 
could be, therefore, considered cumbersome. 
A major challenge in the capturing of fingerprints in the contactless 
mode remains the positioning of the target finger to maintain a fixed 
distance between it and the camera during scans. Existing devices 
employ finger placement guides positioned at designated distances from 
the lens of the camera; with the fingers oftentimes making contact with 
the guides. This was of no concern previously as the focus was to create 
higher-resolution scanners. With the occurrence of the COVID-19 
pandemic, however, the need for well-resolved, robust contactless 
fingerprint scanners is more germane and urgent in order to, amongst 
others, help in containing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 without compro-
mising on security and safety. 
Herein, we outline various efforts implemented towards enhancing 
the correlation factor of the contactless fingerprint scanner whilst 
reducing its false positive errors. In addition, the developed device is 
compared with relevant existing technologies to highlight its unique and 
innovative features. The major contributions of the proposed method 
include achieving actual contactless fingerprint scans with precision, 
enhanced correlation factors; derived from the high-precision finger-
print acquisition process, and an effective, efficient and convenient 
fingerprinting architectural technique. 
2. Materials and method 
The flowchart for the development of the contactless fingerprint 
scanner is presented in Fig. 1. 
2.1. Contactless positioning of finger 
In this work, a convenient and precise method of positioning the 
finger in a fixed position, vertically and horizontally, away from the 
camera lens, without making contact with the device, was designed and 
developed (cf. Fig. 2). With the aid of two infrared-proximity sensors at 
the sides of the camera, the target finger was guided until it was properly 
aligned at a designated spot in the x, y, z axes. A red-spot light beam 
flashed to indicate that the finger was properly aligned in an exact po-
sition (of designated x, y, z coordinates) and activate the camera to 
capture the image, simultaneously. 
A microcontroller was used to perform the logic gate to control and 
synchronize the actions of the infrared-proximity sensors with the laser 
beam and the camera’s aperture during the scanning operations. The 
unique architecture of the device provided a non-touch easy guide for 
the positioning of the target finger during scanning. Different correla-
tion factors were assessed based on differently set vertical distances 
away from the camera in order to identify an ideal distance between the 
camera and target finger. Different light intensities and wavelengths

were also investigated for optimal utility. 
2.2. Coupling of the electronic circuit 
The circuit components were coupled following the layout design 
shown in Fig. 3. The circuit consists of the lens camera (ESP 32 CAM), 
infrared-proximity sensors and laser light, as indicator. The two 
infrared-proximity sensors were each placed on both sides of the camera 
and equidistant from the camera. A blue light-emitting diode (LED) light 
beam was implemented as the camera’s flashlight. The ESP 32 CAM is 
also power-saving as it has the capacity to go into sleep mode when no 
finger is detected by the infrared-proximity sensors. The contactless 
scanning device can be powered via a USB charger or the USB port of a 
personal computer. 
2.3. The programming of the device and webpage interface 
The contactless fingerprint scanner microcontroller (Aithinker ESP 
32 WROOM) was programmed in C-language, using the Arduino IDE. 
The webpage interface was designed using HTML and CSS as shown in 
Fig. 4. The WiFi capability of the ESP 32 CAM enabled the connectivity 
of the device to smartphones, laptops and all WiFi-enabled devices. The 
operation of the contactless fingerprint biometric scanner followed the 
algorithm in steps. The device implements the pattern recognition al-
gorithms in machine learning language (MLL); in which the fingerprint 
is first enrolled and stored in a database, where any scanned fingerprint 
data can be sampled and matched within the verification stage. Python 
language was deployed in the programming. 
The scanner used the images (pictures) captured by the camera to 
identify the different fingers, just like the traditional fingerprint scan-
ners. The images were stored and processed using image recognition 
algorithms similar to the ones used in face recognition. Each image file 
was converted into a binary file, which was then analyzed pixel by pixel. 
Whenever a finger is scanned, the system searches the database for a 
match. The more the samples of a particular fingerprint stored, the 
better and more robust the results of the scan. 
Once the device is switched on, it searches for an available 
programme-compatible WiFi device to pair and continues to search for a 
WiFi-enabled device if none is available. On securing a connection, it 
waits for the infrared-proximity sensors to detect a target finger for 
scanning. Once a finger is detected at the predetermined distance from 
the camera, the detected finger is scanned. It then stores the newly 
captured fingerprint data in the memory storage device (when the 
ENROLL button is enabled from the webpage; cf. Fig. 4) for later use. On 
the other hand, when the enroll button is not selected (from the web-
page), the device compares the captured fingerprint images with the 
previously stored fingerprint data, computes the correlation factor from 
the sample and displays the value of the achieved correlation factor for 
analysis. 
2.4. WiFi-enablement for enrollment and verification 
The device was designed to match a high population of users needing 
its services since multiple-user enrollment and verification devices are 
known to be ideal for authentication purposes in public domains with 
high population indices [35]. To ensure easy availability and fast 
turn-around-times during the verification process, the microcontroller 
Aithinker ESP32 WROOM was implemented. It enables the WiFi

connection of the contactless fingerprint biometric scanner to other 
WiFi-enabled devices, such as mobile phones, ipads, laptops, personal 
computers, etc. A snapshot of the webpage is shown in Fig. 4, displaying 
the internet protocol (IP). 
2.5. Packaging of the device 
The packaging of the developed device is robust and compact, with 
an opening on top to guide the user on the positioning of the target 
finger. The fingerprint scanner is delineated in Fig. 2(a) with a dimen-
sion of 14 cm (length) by 12 cm (width) by 7 cm (height) in size. This is 
different from current approaches, with openings to let the target finger 
inside a casing with a physical framework to confine the finger during 
scanning [36]. The contactless fingerprint scanner herein has been 
designed in such a manner that the target finger is neither confined nor 
in contact with the scanner’s architecture. The scanner is positioned 
separately from where the finger is aligned, in open space, to the 
camera. 
The coupling of the electronic components on the circuit board was 
also implemented with the image-capturing components properly posi-
tioned at points where they can function without obstructions. The 
circuit diagram layout is presented in Fig. 3. The two infrared-proximity 
sensors go into sleep mode when there is no finger in scanning view. The 
inactive mode of the sensors conserves electric power, making the de-
vice energy efficient. 
3. Results 
Varying the set distances between the finger and camera was 
observed to affect the values of the correlation factor, in agreement with 
previous reports [34]. Consequently, to determine the ideal distance of 
the target finger from the camera during scanning, the two 
infrared-proximity sensors were set-up to detect at different distances 
between the camera and target finger, and the correlation factors for the 
distances were recorded (cf. Table 1). The contactless scanner was able 
to capture fingerprint images at distances within 0.5–9.5 cm, from the 
camera to the target finger, with the highest correlation factor of 59.9% 
at a distance of 3.5 cm from the camera. 
Furthermore, it was noticed that the achieved correlation factor 
varied slightly with the intensity of the illuminating background light. 
Therefore, the effect on the correlation factor was tested by applying a 
light beam of different intensities (50–280 lm) at 3.5 cm (Table 2). The 
results indicate that the higher the light intensity, the better the 
fingerprint image resolution, which in turn enhances the correlation 
factor. 
It is well-known that the percentages of light reflected, transmitted 
and/or absorbed contribute to the resolutions of the images obtained 
during fingerprint scanning and these, in turn, influence the correlation

which indicates that the target finger is properly aligned before scanning. EPS-

that performs the logic gate functions. When the target finger is sensed by the 
two infrared-proximity sensors at a fixed vertical and horizontal distance away 
from the camera, the laser point beam switches on and the camera simulta-
neously captures the image. The microcontroller performs the logic functions 
controlling the two infrared-proximity sensors, lens camera and laser 
point beam.

such as mobile phones, ipads, personal computers and laptops.

factors obtained [34]. Nonetheless, light irradiance at long wavelengths 
is absorbed by the epidermis. To ameliorate skin damage, blue light (λ =
500 nm), which is less absorbed by the skin, was implemented for the 
background illumination at 25 lumens at the 3.5 cm distance. The results 
are collected in Table 3. 
Blue light at 280 lumens was also tested to examine its impact at 
higher intensity. Gratifyingly, the highest correlation factor of 97.51% 
was obtained using blue light of 500 nm at 280 lumens intensity and a 
3.5 cm distance between the target finger and lens camera (cf. Table 3). 
4. Discussion 
The high-precision contactless fingerprint biometric scanner devel-
oped in this project overcomes the challenge of positioning the target 
finger at a fixed point during scanning, without contact. Previous 
technologies implemented finger placement guides to achieve the 
alignment of the target finger at a fixed position but with the possibility 
of the finger touching the placement guides, leading to the spread of 
contagious infections. Other unconstrained acquisition setups are faced 
with problems of motion blur and inconstant fingerprint image resolu-
tions [37,38]. Herein, two infrared-proximity sensors have been 
deployed with an electronic logic-controlled microcontroller to achieve 
the non-touch alignment of the target finger in a fixed constant position 
away from the camera. 
The distance between the target finger and lens camera during scan 
operations was found to be optimal at 3.5 cm, with a correlation factor of 
59.9% (Table 1). Other factors that influence the correlation factor of 
the contactless fingerprint scanners were also investigated, with a view 
to improving it. For instance, most contactless fingerprint scanners 
implement diffused white light for background illumination. This is 
reported to produce a uniform but low resolution, which results in a 
reduction in the correlation factor [39]. The background light intensity 
was varied between 50 lm and 280 lm in this study (Table 2). It is also 
significant to note that the luminous flux range of the samples investi-
gated was within that of liquid crystal display (LCD) units in mobile 
phones and laptops. The highest fingerprint correlation factor was 
achieved at 280 lm, with a correlation factor of 78.12%. It is evident that 
the increased light intensity enhanced the resolution of the fingerprint 
images, resulting in their improved correlation factors. 
Cognizant of the reports that white light and other longer wave-
length radiations are absorbed by the epidermal layer of the skin [40, 
41], white light was substituted with blue light (500 nm), which is less 
absorbed by the skin, and its impact on correlation factor was assessed. 
A corollary is that the blue illuminating light enhanced the correlation 
factors of the fingerprint images, with the highest value at 97.51%. The 
excellent values obtained for the correlation factors using blue light can 
be attributed to the high-resolution fingerprint images generated, 
which, due to reduced absorption by the skin, more clearly outlined the 
ridges and valleys of the target finger. The import of this wavelength 
change from illuminating white to blue light is, therefore, not only an 
improved correlation factor but also a device benign to the skin and 
environmentally friendly. 
Fig. 5 compares the correlation factors obtained using blue illumi-
nating light (λ = 500 nm) at both low (25 lm) and high (280 lm) in-
tensities (cf. Table 3), highlighting the fact that increased light intensity 
enhances correlation factor by improving the resolution of the finger-
print images. This was similarly observed with white light (cf. Table 2). 
The robustness of this fingerprint scanner is demonstrated with 
variations in the intensities of the illuminating background light be-
tween 50 lm and 280 lm, and variations of the luminous flux for blue 
light at 500 nm. The developed fingerprinting device delivered 
improved correlation factors and was observed to perform best when the 
target finger was placed at a vertical distance of 3.5 cm away from the 
camera lens, applying blue light of 500 nm at an intensity of 280 lm. 
The correlation factor values obtained when using white light of 280 
lm intensity for background illumination in our model contactless 
fingerprint scanner, with an optimal distance of 3.5 cm between the 
target finger and lens camera, was also compared to those generated 
using blue light at both 25 lm and 280 lm (Fig. 6). Overall, blue light 
proved better resolving, with higher correlation factor values, than 
white light at 280 lm intensity although the values of the correlation 
factor obtained with white light of 280 lm were comparable to those of 
25 lm blue illuminating light. 
One of the major concerns of fingerprint authentication is the issue of 
security and privacy. The fingerprint biometric scanners can be 
vulnerable to such system failures as intrinsic failures, which include 
failures caused by faulty sensors and inaccurate sample matching as well 
as failures due to fingerprint features extraction or false errors [42]. 
Non-intrinsic failures, on the other hand, are mainly attributable to 
malicious attacks. Therefore, the protection of the fingerprint data 
during the acquisition, storage, sampling and verification exercises is 
paramount. Pertinently, the fingerprint acquisition techniques imple-
mented herein eliminate the risks associated with the fraudulent 
acquisition of latent fingerprints. The security concepts and methods 
implemented to address fingerprint data confidentiality, authenticity 
and integrity as well as its diversity, non-repudiation and revocability in 
the software development of this device will be reported elsewhere. 
5. Conclusions 
In this study, a new approach to fingerprint image acquisition 
technology using a system that enforces contactless fingerprinting in a 
precise and efficient manner has been successfully demonstrated. It 
generates great potentials in the replacement of the conventional touch- 
fingerprint scanners and is especially apropos in the wake of the pre-
vailing COVID-19 pandemic to mitigate the spread of the virus and other 
contagious infections transmitted through surfaces. 
The findings suggest best techniques towards achieving optimal 
fingerprint correlation factor values with reduced false positive errors. 
The contactless fingerprint biometric scanner developed herein is pres-
ently at its proof-of-concept stage and a requisite patent has been filed in 
Nigeria (with registration number NG/PT/NC/2020/4853). 
It is vital to point out that in order to ensure the compatibility of the 
contactless fingerprint biometric systems with already-existing touch-

based equivalent fingerprint images, the device developed in this work 
possesses the unique feature of producing 2-D images with improved 
correlation factors. It is common knowledge that fingerprint scanners 
that operate by using the 3-D scene reconstruction of images suffer the 
challenges of occlusion, scale and light variations, and perspective dis-
tortions, which reduce their correlation factors especially when applied 
in the verification of 2-D images already captured with touch-based 
fingerprint scanners. 
To surmise, high-precision contactless fingerprint scans and 
enhanced correlation factors have been achieved in this protocol as well 
as an effective, efficient and convenient fingerprinting architectural 
technique, which not only bodes well for mitigating the 3-D/2-D image 
resolution dichotomy but also the spread of contagions, such as the 
SARS-CoV-2.
