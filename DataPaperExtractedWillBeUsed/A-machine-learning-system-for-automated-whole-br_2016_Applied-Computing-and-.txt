Abstract
Epilepsy is a chronic neurological condition that affects approximate-
ly 70 million people worldwide. Characterised by sudden bursts of excess elec-
tricity in the brain, manifesting as seizures, epilepsy is still not well understood
when compared with other neurological disorders. Seizures often happen unex-
pectedly and attempting to predict them has been a research topic for the last
30 years. Electroencephalograms have been integral to these studies, as the
recordings that they produce can capture the brain’s electrical signals. The diag-
nosis of epilepsy is usually made by a neurologist, but can be difﬁcult to make in
the early stages. Supporting para-clinical evidence obtained from magnetic reso-
nance imaging and electroencephalography may enable clinicians to make a
diagnosis of epilepsy and instigate treatment earlier. However, electroencephalo-
gram capture and interpretation is time consuming and can be expensive due to
the need for trained specialists to perform the interpretation. Automated

detection of correlates of seizure activity generalised across different regions of
the brain and across multiple subjects may be a solution. This paper explores this
idea further and presents a supervised machine learning approach that classiﬁes
seizure and non-seizure records using an open dataset containing 342 records (171
seizures and 171 non-seizures). Our approach posits a new method for generalis-
ing seizure detection across different subjects without prior knowledge about the
focal point of seizures. Our results show an improvement on existing studies with
88% for sensitivity, 88% for speciﬁcity and 93% for the area under the curve,
with a 12% global error, using the k-NN classiﬁer.

1. Introduction
Epilepsy is a chronic condition of the brain, and causes repeated seizures, com-
monly referred to as ﬁts. Epilepsy is said to affect 70 million people worldwide
[19]. The risk of developing epilepsy is greatest at the extremes of life with inci-
dences more common in the elderly than the young [18] and is the cause of prema-
ture mortality for those suffering with the condition [19].
Seizures can be focal (partial) and exist in one part of the brain only, or they can
be general and affect both halves of the brain. During a focal seizure, the person
may be conscious and unaware that a seizure is taking place, or they may have
uncontrollable movements or unusual feelings and sensations. A diagnosis of
epilepsy is made with the help of an electroencephalogram (EEG). EEG recordings
are commonly visualised as charts of electrical energy produced by the brain and
plotted against time [16].
The majority of previous works on seizure detection and prediction have
focused on patient-speciﬁc predictors, where a classiﬁer is trained on one person
and tested on the same person [13,10,25,26,63,9]. In this paper, the emphasis is
on using EEG classiﬁcation to generalise detection across all regions of the brain
using multiple subject records.
A whole-brain seizure detection approach supports para-clinical evidence
obtained from magnetic resonance imaging and EEG to make a diagnosis of
epilepsy and instigate treatment earlier. It helps to mitigate the difﬁculties associ-
ated with the capture and interpretation of electroencephalogram by neurologists.
In this paper, a robust data processing methodology is adopted and several clas-
siﬁers are trained and evaluated, using 342 EEG segments extracted from the EEG
records of 24 patients suffering with epilepsy.
The structure, of the remainder, of this paper is as follows. Section 2 describes
the underlying principles of EEG and the type of features extracted from EEG sig-
nals. Section 3 discusses machine learning and its use in seizure and non-seizure
classiﬁcation, while Section 4 describes the evaluation. The results are discussed
in Section 5 before the paper is concluded in Section 6.

2. Seizure detection and classiﬁcation
Gotman is one of the pioneers of seizure detection whose research in the area dates
back to 1979. In Gotman et al. [22], he proposed a system for automatic recogni-
tion of inter-ictal epileptic activity in prolonged EEG recordings using a spike and
sharp wave recognition method. Extensions to this work are presented in Kofﬂer
and Gotman [29], Gotman [21], Gotman [23], Qu and Gotman [51], while recent
works have focussed on the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
and the correlation between cerebral hemodynamic changes and epileptic seizure
events visible in EEG [36]. More recently, he has looked at automatic seizure
detection in sEEG using high frequency activities in the wavelet domain [10].
In other studies, the most common classiﬁer used to distinguish between seizure
and non-seizure events has been the support vector machine (SVM). Using the
CHB-MIT database and a patient-speciﬁc prediction methodology, the study in
Shoeb [55] used a SVM classiﬁer on EEG recordings from 24 subjects. The results
show that a classiﬁcation accuracy of 96% for sensitivity was produced, with a
false-positive rate of 0.08 per hour. In a similar study ﬁve records from the
CHB-MIT dataset (containing 65 seizures) were evaluated using a linear dis-
criminant analysis classiﬁer [28]. The overall accuracy reported was 91.8%,
83.6% for sensitivity, and 100% for speciﬁcity. For similar SVM studies using
other datasets the reader is referred to [55,28,44,62].
Acharya et al. focused on using entropies for EEG seizure detection and seven
different classiﬁers [6]. The best-performing classiﬁer was the Fuzzy Sugeno clas-
siﬁer, which achieved 99.4% for sensitivity, 100% for speciﬁcity, and 98.1% for
overall accuracy. The worst performing classiﬁer was the Naı¨ve Bayes Classiﬁer,
which achieved 94.4% for sensitivity, 97.8% for speciﬁcity, and 88.1% for accura-
cy. Nasehi and Pourghassem [43] used the same CHB-MIT dataset with a Particle
Swarm Optimisation Neural Network (PSONN) which produced 98% for sensi-
tivity and a false-positive rate of 0.125 per hour. Using the FRE1 dataset Yuan
et al. presented a patient-speciﬁc seizure detection system and an extreme
machine-learning algorithm to train a neural network [65]. Twenty-one seizure
records were used to train the classiﬁer and 65 for testing. The results show that
the system achieved an average of 91.92% for sensitivity, 94.89% for speciﬁcity
and 94.9% for overall accuracy.
Patel et al. [49] proposed a low power, real-time classiﬁcation algorithm, for
detecting seizures in ambulatory EEG. The study compared linear discriminant
analysis (LDA), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), Mahalanobis dis-
criminant analysis (MDA), and SVM classiﬁers on 13 subjects from the FRE data-
set. The results show that the LDA gave the best results when trained and tested
on a single patient, with 94.2% for sensitivity, 77.9% for speciﬁcity, and 87.7% for
overall accuracy. When generalised across all subjects, the results show 90.9% for
sensitivity, 59.5% for speciﬁcity, and 76.5% for overall accuracy.

3. Electroencephalography and feature extraction
Electroencephalography is the term given to the recording of electrical activity
resulting from ionic current ﬂows generated by neurons in the brain and is mainly
used to evaluate seizures and epilepsy. In order to retrieve EEG signals, electrodes
are placed on the scalp where odd numbered electrodes are placed on the left side
of the scalp and even numbered electrodes on the right. Electrode locations and
names are speciﬁed by the International 10–20 system [55].
The collection of raw EEG signals is always temporal. However, for analysis
and feature extraction purposes, translation, into other domains, is possible and
often required. These include frequency representations, via Fourier Transform
[42,37,24,12] and wavelet transform [12,32,40,17,14,39]. The advantage of frequen-
cy-related parameters is that they are less susceptible to signal quality variations,
due to electrode placement or the physical characteristics of subjects [38].
In order to obtain frequency parameters, several studies have used Power Spec-
tral Density (PSD). Within PSD, Peak Frequency is one of the features considered
in many studies. It describes the frequency of the highest peak in the PSD. During
a seizure, EEG signals tend to contain a major cyclic component, which shows
itself as a dominant peak in the frequency domain. In one example, Aarabi et al.
used Peak Frequency, along with sample entropy and other amplitude features,
to detect epileptic seizures and achieved a sensitivity of 98.7% and a false detection
rate of 0.27 per hour [3].
Meanwhile, Ning and Lyu [45] found that Median Frequency displayed sig-
niﬁcant differences between seizure and non-seizure patients. By segmenting the
EEG signal into ﬁve separate frequency bands for delta (d: 0.5 6 f 6 4 Hz), theta
(h: 4 6 f 6 8 Hz), alpha (a: 8 6 f 6 12 Hz): beta (b: 12 6 f 6 25 Hz), and gamma
(c: 25 6 f), it was possible to predict 79 of 83 seizures, with a sensitivity value of
95.2%.
Root mean square (RMS) has also been considered a useful feature for distin-
guishing between seizure and non-seizure events. RMS measures the magnitude
of the varying quantity and is a good signal strength estimator in EEG frequency
bands [5]. In a study on neonatal seizure detection [50], 21 features for seizure clas-
siﬁcation were compared, which saw RMS achieves an overall accuracy of
77.71%. The study showed that RMS outperformed all the other features used.
Entropy has been used as a measure of the complexity, or uncertainty, of an
EEG signal, where the more chaotic the signal is, the higher the entropy. There
are two kinds of entropy estimators: spectral entropies, which use the amplitude
of the power spectrum; and signal entropies, which use the time series directly
[27]. Many authors agree that during a seizure, the brain activity is more pre-
dictable than during a normal, non-seizure, phase and this is reﬂected by a sudden
drop in the entropy value [46,47,61,66].
Energy is a measure of the EEG signal strength. Rather than looking at the
energy of the whole EEG signal, the energy distribution across frequency bands
A machine learning system for automated whole-brain seizure detection
73
has been used in seizure detection [46]. The study found that delta and theta fre-
quency bands saw a much larger distribution of energy during a seizure compared
to normal EEG, whereas the alpha, beta and gamma frequency bands saw a lower
energy distribution during a seizure. Using the energy distribution, per frequency
band, as a feature achieved an overall accuracy of 94%.
Correlation dimension has been investigated as a correlation measure in several
studies, which is a nonlinear univariate, widely used to measure fractal dimension.
Fractal dimension measures the complexity of the EEG signal, in other words, the
regularity and divergence of the signal [33,7]. In [1] correlation dimension and ﬁve
other features for seizure prediction of focal neocortical epilepsy produced reason-
ably good results with 90.2% for sensitivity and 97% for speciﬁcity. However,
when looking speciﬁcally at the correlation dimension they found the results
dropped in 44.9% of seizures and increased in the pre-ictal phase in 44.9% of sei-
zures. They also found that there were stronger dimension changes in the remote
channels compared with those near the seizure onset.
In [8] correlation dimension and the largest Lyapunov exponent were studied to
determine their ability to detect seizures. The study showed that neither measure
on its own was useful for the task, but did work better, when they were used
together. They also noted that correlation dimension was only useful when applied
to the frequency sub-bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma), and not on the
entire 0–60 Hz frequency spectrum that was used in the study. The authors con-
cluded that changes in dynamics are not spread out across the entire spectrum,
but are limited to certain frequency bands.
Skewness is a third-order statistical moment, and kurtosis is the fourth. Along
with the ﬁrst and second order moments, mean and variance, respectively, the four
statistical moments provide information on the amplitude distribution of a time
series. Speciﬁcally, skewness and kurtosis give an indication of the shape of the dis-
tribution [4]. Khan et al. use skewness and kurtosis, along with normalised coefﬁ-
cient of variation, for seizure detection in paediatric patients. They managed to
detect all 55 seizures from a subset of 10 patients, achieving 100% sensitivity, with
a false detection rate of 1.1 per hour.
4. Automated whole-brain seizure detection
The aim of most studies, in EEG detection, has been to detect patient-speciﬁc focal
seizures, rather than predicting general seizures across a much bigger population.
As Shoeb [55] explains, a seizure EEG pattern is speciﬁc to a particular patient.
The main reason for this is that focal seizures can occur in any part of the brain,
and therefore, can only be detected in the EEG on speciﬁc channels. A classiﬁer
trained on a patient who experiences focal seizures in the occipital lobes, for exam-
ple, would no doubt be trained on features from channels, including electrodes O1,
and O2 (electrodes to monitor electrical activity in the occipital lobe), as these
74
P. Fergus et al.
would be the channels from the area of the seizure and therefore, best at detecting
the seizure.
For this reason, and due to the conﬁguration of the dataset, this study focuses
on discriminating between seizure and non-seizure EEGs across a group of 24 sub-
jects. The classiﬁers are trained on all patient records and therefore, classiﬁcation
is generalised across all subjects using features from channels that capture the
EEG in all parts of the brain.
The approach utilises machine learning algorithms embedded in-line with exist-
ing clinical systems to enhance clinical practices in epilepsy diagnostics. The pro-

mated detection of correlates of seizure activity generalised across different regions
of the brain and across multiple subjects.
4.1. Methodology
The CHB-MIT dataset is a publicly available database from physionet.org that
contains 686 scalp EEG recordings from 23 patients treated at the Children’s
Hospital in Boston. The subjects had anti-seizure medication withdrawn, and
EEG recordings were taken for up to several days after.
The EEG recordings are divided among 24 cases (one patient has two sets of
EEG recordings 1.5 years apart). The patients range between 1.5 and 22 years
of age, and there are 5 males and 17 females. Case 24 was added after the original
dataset was collected and has no patient data.
Most of the recordings are one hour long, although those belonging to case 10
are two hours and those belonging to cases 4, 6, 7, 9, and 23 are four hours long.
Records that contain at least one seizure are classed as seizure records and those
that contain no seizures as non-seizure records. Of the 686 records, 198 contain
seizures.
Although the description supplied with the dataset states that recordings were
captured using the international 10–20 system of EEG electrode positions and
nomenclature, it was found that 17 of the ﬁles that contained seizures had different
channel montages to the rest of the seizure ﬁles. Therefore, these 17 records have
been excluded from this study, leaving 181 seizure ﬁles. A further 10 records were
removed from the dataset due to a large number of missing data.
The ﬁnal dataset used in this study was constructed from 60-s data blocks
(mean ictal length across the 171 seizure records), comprising the ictal data (sei-
zure), which were extracted from 171 seizure ﬁles. Table 1 provides a summary
of the ictal data with the 171 ictal blocks.
The results show that 25% of the data blocks (42.75 blocks) contain less than or
equal to 23 s of ictal data, which means that 75% of our data blocks (128.25
A machine learning system for automated whole-brain seizure detection
75
blocks) contain 23 s or more of ictal data, with the average block containing 45 s if
we consider the median. However, the data contain outliers, i.e. the Max value is
752. To get a more representative summary the ﬁrst 60 s of ictal data is used from
each seizure record that lasts longer than 60 s. Table 2 provides a summary of the
data.
The average block now contains 45 s if we consider the median, 40.52% if we
consider the mean. More importantly, the majority of the data blocks (64%) of
the 171 ictal blocks contain 30 s or more of icta data. In a real-world scenario,
it is unlikely that, whatever window size we select, data blocks will contain only
ictal data. The more realistic case is that it will contain both ictal and non-ictal
data. By having 60-s blocks with different ictal and non-ictal data splits, this
allows us to determine the performance of the classiﬁers under conditions more
aligned with a real-world situation. However, future work will explore optimal
window sizes. To balance the dataset, 171 data blocks randomly extracted from
non-seizure ﬁles were also added to the dataset.
Fig. 1 shows the processes used in the methodology to process the data, that
include ﬁltering, feature extraction, feature selection, classiﬁcation and ﬁnally
validation.
Each of these processes is discussed in more detail below. Fig. 1 shows a data
science methodology that produces a robust data analytics based solution.
4.1.1. Data pre-processing
In the CHB-MIT database, each record was sampled at 256 Hz, with 16-bit resolu-
tion. Signals were recorded simultaneously through twenty-three different chan-
nels, via 19 electrodes and a ground attached to the surface of the scalp.
A bandpass ﬁlter was applied to each of the 342 EEG segments (171 seizures,
171 non-seizures) to extract the EEG data in each of the frequency blocks. Second
order butterworth ﬁlters were used as they offer good transition band character-
istics at low coefﬁcient orders; thus, they can be implemented efﬁciently. This
results in ﬁve columns of additional data; the complete bandwidth (0.5–30 Hz),
delta (d: 0.5 6 f 6 4 Hz), theta (h: 4 6 f 6 8 Hz), alpha (a: 8 6 f 6 12 Hz): and beta

(b: 12 6 f 6 25 Hz). In other words, each block contains 115 columns of data for
each of the 23 EEG channels in the original data (N = 23 * (complete
bandwidth + delta + theta + alpha + beta) = 23 * 5 = 115).
4.1.2. Feature selection
The feature vectors in this paper are generated from the 171 seizure ﬁles and 171
non-seizure blocks, obtained from 23 patients, using Peak Frequency, Median Fre-
quency, variance, root mean squares, sample entropy, skewness and kurtosis. These
features were extracted from each of the 115 columns in an EEG block (N = 7 fea-
tures * 115 columns = 805). The literature reports that Median Frequency, sample
entropy and root mean square have the most potential to discriminate between sei-
zure and non-seizure records. To validate these ﬁndings, the discriminant capa-
bilities of each feature are determined using several measures: statistical
signiﬁcance (p and q-values), principal component analysis (PCA) – Principle Com-
ponent one (PC1) and Principle Component two (PC2), linear discriminant analysis
independent search (LDAi), linear discriminant analysis forward search (LDAf), lin-
ear discriminant analysis backward search (LDAb) and gram-schmidt (GS) analysis.
Using these measures, the top 20 uncorrelated features were extracted from all
regions of the EEG scalp readings (region-by-region feature extraction is consid-
ered later in the paper). For example, in the case of p-values we select the top 20
uncorrelated features (from the 805 features that we have) that have the highest p-
values and use these features with all our classiﬁers. The tttest2 function in Matlab
can be used to extract p-values and they can be ranked using the sort function.

These features are then used to determine which classiﬁer performs the best. The
same approach is used for the q-values. The mafdr function in Matlab can be used
to determine the q-values and again, they can be ranked using the sort function. In
the case of Principle Component one (PC1), the top 20 uncorrelated features that
comprise the most variance in PC1 were selected and evaluated against all classi-
ﬁers. The same approach was used for PC2. In the case of linear discriminant ana-
lysis feature selection, the featseli, featself, and featselb provided by the Matlab
pattern recognition toolbox PRTools is used to provide an ordered ranking of fea-
tures. In a similar way, the Gram-Schmidt ranks and orders each feature by
importance.
Table 3 shows that the best results were obtained from the linear discriminant
analysis backward search technique with an area under the curve (AUC) of
91%. This was followed closely by statistical p and q-values with AUC values of
90% and 89% respectively.
Fig. 2 shows (using PCA) that several RMS and Median Frequency features,
from different channels and frequency bands, appear along the principal compo-
nent. This is consistent with the ﬁndings in Ning and Lyu [45], Abdul-latif et al. [5],
Paivinen et al. [47]. The vertical axis shows that CH12_48_Var, CH9_48_Var, and
CH3_0530_MFreq features align closest with the second principal component.
Again, these results are consistent with the ﬁndings in Ning and Lyu [45],
Abdul-latif et al. [5], Paivinen et al. [47].
This study also extracts the top ﬁve uncorrelated features from each of the ﬁve
regions covered by the EEG scalp electrodes as shown in Table 4. This ensures that
each region is represented without the bias from all other regions, and allows clas-
siﬁers to detect focal seizures in different parts of the brain. The features extracted,
using the generalised and region-by-region approach, are used to evaluate the
capabilities of several classiﬁers considered in this study and are the top ﬁve fea-
tures per region selected based on their rank determined by the linear discriminant
backward search technique, creating ﬁve feature sets containing ﬁve features each.
The top 20 uncorrelated features and the 25 region-by-region features are com-
pared in the evaluation.

4.1.3. Classiﬁcation
Following an analysis of the literature, the study in this paper adopts simple, yet
powerful algorithms. These include the linear discriminant classiﬁer (LDC),
quadratic discriminant classiﬁer (QDC), uncorrelated normal density based classiﬁer
(UDC), polynomial classiﬁer (POLYC), logistic classiﬁer (LOGLC), k-nearest
neighbour (KNNC), decision tree (TREEC), parzen classiﬁer (PARZENC) and
the support vector machine (SVC) [61].
4.1.4. Validation methods
In order to determine the overall accuracy of each of the classiﬁers several valida-
tion techniques have been considered. These include Holdout Cross-Validation,
Sensitivities, Speciﬁcities, Receiver Operating Curve (ROC) and area under the
curve (AUC). The Holdout Cross-Validation technique uses 80 per cent of ran-
domly selected observations (N = 19.2) to train the algorithms and 20 per cent
of randomly selected test cases to test the algorithms (N = 3.8).
5. Evaluation
5.1. Results using top twenty uncorrelated features ranked using LDA backward
search feature selection
In the ﬁrst evaluation, the top twenty uncorrelated features, extracted from each
of the frequency bands within each of the EEG channels, and nine classiﬁers
are used. The performance for each classiﬁer is evaluated using the sensitivity,
speciﬁcity, mean error, standard deviation and AUC values with 100 simulations
and randomly selected training and testing sets for each simulation. In this study,

high sensitivities are important to ensure that seizures can be detected within an
alarm system. High speciﬁcities are considered equally important as high false
alarm rates (more than 1 per hour) will deter doctors from using it.
5.1.1. Classiﬁer performance
The ﬁrst evaluation uses all the seizure and non-seizure blocks from all subjects in
the CHB-MIT dataset (171 seizures and 171 non-seizures). The simulations use
80% for training and 20% for testing. Table 5, shows the mean averages obtained
over 100 simulations for the sensitivity, speciﬁcity, and AUC.
As shown in Table 5, the sensitivities (seizure), in this initial test, are low for all
classiﬁers. This is interesting given that the dataset is balanced between seizure and
non-seizure blocks. One possible reason for this is that the ictal length across the
171 records was 60 s. However, in the CHB-MIT records ictal periods ranged
between 2 and 752 (cut down to 60 s) seconds. It is possible that some ictal blocks
resemble non-seizure records resulting in misclassiﬁcation (particularly blocks that
contain 2 s of ictal data). However, given that 64% of the ictal blocks contain
more than 30 s of icta data, this is appropriate for training. Furthermore, it is a
decision that is supported by the relatively high sensitivity, speciﬁcity and AUC

standard deviations obtained over 100 iterations.
The results show that all techniques are able to achieve a classiﬁcation error,
lower than the base-rate error of 50% (i.e. 171/342).

The receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve shows the cut-off values for the
false negative and false-positive rates. Fig. 3 indicates that several of the classiﬁers
performed reasonably well. The AUC values in Table 4 support these ﬁndings with
good accuracy values for the LOGLC and KNNC classiﬁers.
5.2. Results using top ﬁve uncorrelated features ranked using lda backward search
feature selection from ﬁve head regions
In the second evaluation, the top ﬁve uncorrelated features, extracted from ﬁve
main regions across the head, are used to determine whether the detection of sei-
zures can be improved. Again, the performance for each classiﬁer is evaluated
using the sensitivity, speciﬁcity, mean error, standard deviation and AUC values
with 100 simulations and randomly selected training and testing sets for each
simulation.

5.2.1. Classiﬁer performance
The simulations use 80% for training and 20% for testing. As shown in Table 7,
the sensitivities (seizure), for most of the algorithms have improved, including the
speciﬁcities values. The AUC results also show improvements for several of the
classiﬁers, with 93% achieved by the KNNC classiﬁer. From the previous results,
we ﬁnd a 4% increase in sensitivities, a 3% increase in speciﬁcities and a 2%
increase in the performance of the KNNC classiﬁer, with other classiﬁers improv-
ing by similar values.
Again, the results in Table 8 show that the mean error has decreased by 3%
using the holdout technique. This indicates that using a region-by-region approach
is better at discriminating between seizure and non-seizure events.
Overall, the mean errors produced, using all of the validation techniques, are
signiﬁcantly lower than the expected error, which is 171/342, i.e. 50%.
5.2.2. Model selection
Again, the ROC curve shows the cut-off values for the false-negative and false-
positive rates. Fig. 4 indicates that the performance of several classiﬁers improved.
The AUC values in Table 7 support these ﬁndings with the KNNC classiﬁer show-
ing a 2% increase in performance.

6. Discussion
The study has focused on discriminating between seizure and non-seizure EEG
records across a group of 23 subjects, rather than a single individual. The classi-
ﬁers are trained using all 24 cases, and therefore, classiﬁcation is generalised across
the whole population contained in the CHB-MIT database. To achieve this, fea-
tures from all the channels that capture the EEG in all parts of the brain were
used. In the initial classiﬁcation results, the top 20 uncorrelated features from
the whole of the head (not region-by-region) were extracted from 805 possible fea-
tures. This was determined using the linear discriminant analysis backward search
technique to rank features. This approach achieved reasonably good results, using
the KNNC classiﬁer, with 84% for sensitivity, 85% for speciﬁcity, 91% for the
AUC, with a global error of 15%.
Interestingly, the features used in this initial evaluation, involved channels from
the four lobes of the brain, occipital, parietal, frontal, and temporal, but not the
channels spread across the centre of the head. This implied that rather than having
generalised seizures across the whole of the brain, a majority of focal seizures
occurred in each of the lobes. Unlike studies that used the BONN dataset, which
only contains one channel, or the FRE dataset, that contains six channels and

identiﬁes focal and extra focal channels, the CHB-MIT database used in this study
contains 23 channels with no information on the seizure type or location.
Using the top ﬁve uncorrelated features from EEG channels speciﬁc to the ﬁve
main regions of the head improved the sensitivities and speciﬁcities, while produc-
ing high AUC values. The best classiﬁcation algorithm was again the KNNC clas-
siﬁer, which achieved 88% for sensitivity, 88% for speciﬁcity, and an AUC value
of 93% with a 12% global error. This was followed closely by the SVC classiﬁer,
which achieved 85% for sensitivity, 86% for speciﬁcity, and an AUC value of 90%
with a 14% global error.
Comparing our results with other studies, we ﬁnd that Shoeb [55] produced a
better sensitivity value (96%) than those reported in this study. However, their
approach utilised a SVM classiﬁer trained and tested on an individual patient
and was not concerned with the generalisation of seizures across a bigger popula-
tion group. Consequently, the 88% sensitivity value produced in this paper
appears to be extremely good given that our classiﬁers were trained and tested
on data from 23 different patients, not just one. In a similar study, Nasehi and
Pourghassem [43] used a neural network and reported a sensitivity value of
98%, which again is higher than the results reported in this study. However, as
with the work of Shoeb, the classiﬁers were trained and tested on speciﬁc patients.
In comparison with other studies that adopted a similar approach to our study,
our approach produced better overall results. For instance, Khan et al. [28] report
a 83.6% speciﬁcity value, while Patel et al. [49] report 94% for sensitivity, 77.9%
for speciﬁcity, and 87.7% for overall accuracy. Yuan et al. [66] report 91.72% for
sensitivity, 94.89% for speciﬁcity, and 94.9% for accuracy, while Aarabi et al. [2],
Kannathal et al. [27], report similar results. The results found in this paper can be
compared in more detail with the papers listed in Table 9.
This work has potential future clinical applications in the investigation of
patients with suspected seizure disorders and may be useful in the assessment of
patients with non-epileptic attack disorder (NEAD). Introducing automated sei-
zure detection technologies could help increase capacity within healthcare systems
such as the UKs National Health Service (NHS), which currently suffers from a
chronic shortage of trained clinical neurophysiologists to interpret EEGs. Tele-
EEG reporting has previously been suggested as a solution and more recently
online systems [20,41], which are interesting approaches, but carry increased costs
and concerns over data security. Nonetheless, these, including automated seizure
detection may be viable solutions, following further work aimed at improving
accuracy further.
7. Conclusions and future work
Within a supervised-learning paradigm, this study has addressed this challenge by
utilising EEG signals to classify seizure and non-seizure records. Our approach
posits a new method for generalising seizure detection across different subjects

A machine learning system for automated whole-brain seizure detection

without prior knowledge about the focal point of seizures. Our results show an
improvement on existing studies with 88% for sensitivity, 88% for speciﬁcity
and 93% for the area under the curve, with a 12% global error, using the k-
NN classiﬁer.
The results suggest that the algorithms in-situ with existing clinical systems and
practices may enable clinicians to make a diagnosis of epilepsy and instigate treat-
ment earlier. It can help to reduce costs by limiting the number of trained special-
ists required to perform the interpretation by automating the detection of
correlates of seizure activity generalised across different regions of the brain and
across multiple subjects.
There are a large number of features reported in the literature, which have not
been considered in this paper. In particular our future work will consider the set of
features described in Logesparan et al. [34], Logesparan et al. [35]. Furthermore,
our future work will investigate the use of more advanced machine learning algo-
rithms, despite the good performance of the classiﬁers considered in this paper. In
particular, we will investigate the use of convolutional neural networks [53] and
SVM with different kernels [54].
Window sizes will also be considered to determine whether further improve-
ments on accuracies can be made. Future development will also utilise regression
analysis and a larger number of observations. This may help to deﬁne the charac-
teristics of the pre-ictal phase. In addition, more advanced classiﬁcation algo-
rithms, and techniques, will be considered, including advanced artiﬁcial neural
network architectures (higher order and spiking neural networks). The investiga-
tion and comparison, of features, such as fractal dimension and cepstrum analysis,
autocorrelation zero crossing and correlation dimension, have also not been per-
formed. These techniques should be investigated in a head-to-head comparison,
with linear methods.
The paper has investigated the use of classic yet powerful machine learning
algorithms and evaluated their ability to detect correlates of seizure activity. While
the results are convincing the paper does not address how the system can be gen-
eralised for normal use. Furthermore, it does not address real-time concerns where
performance will degraded signiﬁcantly. The approach evaluates the algorithms
using ofﬂine data; however, this is not a good indicator of the system’s ability
as the signals that are used to train and test the algorithms are processed and
cleaned and appropriate features extracted. This is a major concern and our future
work will look to implement the methodology pipeline using real-time signals,
using advances in the Internet of Things and Big Data community that currently
utilise data processing technologies, such as Apache Spark.
Finally, there are concerns regarding the veriﬁcation of the results produced
using the CHB-MIT dataset against other datasets. Our future work will investi-
gate the use of a bigger dataset, using patients provided by our co-author from
The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust, and other datasets that permit access
to verify the ﬁndings in this paper.

Overall, the study demonstrates that classiﬁcation algorithms provide an inter-
esting line of enquiry, when separating seizure and non-seizure records.
