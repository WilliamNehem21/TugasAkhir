Main aim of this study is to develop a software prototype tool for grading and diagnosing depression that
will help general physicians for ﬁrst hand applications. Identiﬁcation of key symptoms responsible for
depression is also another important issue considered in this study. It involves collection of data taken
from patients through doctors. Due to several reasons, collection of data in Indian scenario is extremely
difﬁcult and thus this tool will be very handy and useful for general physicians working at remote loca-
tions. Also, it is possible to collect a data pool through this software model. An intelligent Neuro-Fuzzy
model is developed for this purpose. Performance of the said model has been optimized through two
approaches. In Approach 1, where a back-propagation algorithm has been considered and in Approach
2, Genetic Algorithm has been used. The model is trained with 78 data and validated with 10 data.
Approach 2 superseded Approach 1 in terms of diagnostic accuracy. Therefore, it can be said that the soft
computing-based diagnostic models could assist the doctors to make informed decisions. Data for train-
ing and validation for this purpose has been collected during 2004–2005 from a Government mental hos-
pital in India.

1. Introduction
WHO says ‘‘depression is a common illness worldwide” and it is
a growing risk [1–3]. There could be several factors contributing to
depression and it is closely related to physical health [1–3]. There
exist known and effective treatment procedures, which reach less
than half of the sufferers [1,4]. There are several reasons such as
lack of trained professionals and lack of resources [1], silent pro-
gression [5], social stigma [6] and perception difference among
doctors leading to ‘under’ or ‘over’ diagnoses [7]. So, diagnosis
has to be proper to reduce the disease load [8].
SC techniques are applied for screening and diagnosing the dif-
ferent ailments [9,10] in the last couple of decades. Clustering
techniques alone are applied for grading of depression [11]. How-
ever, Chattopadhyay et al. [12] combined fuzzy logic with cluster-
ing for capturing the symptoms psychiatric diseases of human
being. They later developed a NN-based toolbox for grading of
adult depression [13] and classiﬁed it into three categories namely,
‘mild’, ‘moderate’, and ‘severe’ [13]. Tai and Chiu [14] used RBFN to
understand the reasons for suicidal tendencies of Taiwanese sol-
diers. Chattopadhyay [15] developed a fuzzy-based automated
model for grading depression. Later stage, Chattopadhyay et al.
[16] tried to minimize the overlapping among the three different
grades of depression. Regression analysis is also used for the sim-
ilar purpose by Chattopadhyay and Acharya [17].
It is understood from the literature that grading of depression is
a difﬁcult task. It is mainly because of the non-availability of the
data. It may of different reasons which are indicated below.
(i). social stigma,
(ii). majority of the patients do not approach to psychiatrists
ﬁrst, they approach to general physicians and when it
becomes severe then comes to the psychiatrists,

(iii). non existence of systems of collecting data by the doctors.
For the ﬁrst time reporting to the doctors, majority of the
patients are prescribed medicines. As a result true picture
of the patients are not available to the doctors,
(iv). inferior health management system.
Therefore, basic purpose of our study is to develop a prototype
tool which forecasts depression better than the general physicians.
In this context, SC-based techniques are found to provide formid-
able solutions. However, performance of SC-based techniques
depends on its formulation and optimization of the same. Out of
different SC-based models, neuro-fuzzy models are ﬁnding wide
applications in the recent times in different ﬁeld with high predic-
tion accuracies [18,19]. Development of a neuro-fuzzy-based soft-
ware prototype model has been made in this study. It has been
observed that, the performance of neuro-fuzzy systems depends
on its DB and RB [20]. In majority of the case, user deﬁned the
same, which in no sense becomes optimal. Some researchers tried
to combine different SC-based techniques. Therefore, the main
contribution of this work is the development of a neuro-fuzzy-
based prototype model for grading depression. Later, performance
of the developed approach was made through two optimization
methods, namely back-propagation algorithm and genetic algo-
rithm. The model will be used by the general physicians for collect-
ing more data. After proper validation with large set of data, it will
be given for use to the psychiatrists/experts of mental health prob-
lems. Presently, the model is validated using data given by the clin-
icians. However, the model is evolutionary in nature and thus, it
might handles uncertainty, impreciseness present (which are pre-
dominant) in the system in much broader way.
The developed neuro-Fuzzy model and its optimization proce-
dures using two approaches are described in Section 2 and results
have been analyzed in Section 3. Final outcomes of the work are
discussed and future directions are mentioned in Section 4.
2. Methodology
Collecting depression data is very difﬁcult. It is because of dif-
ferent reasons such as (i) prevailing social stigma, especially in
the developing nations, (ii) difﬁculties in accessing the psychia-
trists as they are very few in numbers, (iii) non-existence of system
for collecting data by the doctors and so on. Together it leads to
real a challenge in obtaining the clean data. The basic aim of this
study is to build a software toolbox that will be of help for the
GPs, who is the ﬁrst point of contact to the patients and data will
be possible to be collected.
2.1. Data collection
A study is made on 312 patients reported to one of the famous
mental hospital in India in the year 2004–2005. Those patients
reported to the hospital for the ﬁrst time and they did not take
any medicines before reporting to the hospital. They are then
grouped in two. First group belongs to the patients who have sui-
cidal
ideations
and
require
immediate
treatment.
However,
patients belonging to the second group (total 88 patients) were
further analyzed towards the severity of depression. Therefore,
there exist 88 data; out of which 78 has been used for training/
optimizing the neuro-fuzzy architecture and rest 10 have been
used for testing the performance of optimized architecture. Seven
common symptoms (FS, LP, WL, IN, H, LA, PA) are then observed
by three senior psychiatrists. Doctors are then requested to quan-
tify the symptoms and severity of depression with which those 88
patients are suffering.
2.2. Neuro-fuzzy model construction
A Mamdani-type [21] NN-FL model was developed by Hui et al.
[20] is used in this study for grading depression (refer to Fig. 1).
Interested readers may go through the paper of Hui et al. [20,22]
for detailed discussion on the development of NN-FL system. In
the present study, seven inputs representing the seven different
symptoms and one output representing the depression is used.
Three different grades of the inputs are considered (m, M and s).
The data base of the NN-FL system is shown in Fig. 2. Since there
are three possibilities (i.e., mild, moderate and severe) of the load
of each of seven inputs, there will be 37 = 2187 numbers of possible
input combinations, for which grades of depression would vary as
mild, moderate and severe, based on the symptom load. Manually
constructed rules are presented in Table 1 and one particular rule
(say the ﬁrst rule of the above table) looks like:
If FS is m & LP is m & WL is m & IN is m & H is m & LA is m & PA is
m THEN Depression is M.
For more details related to rule based selection, identiﬁcation of
relevant rules, optimization using GA and gravitational search
algorithm, interested readers may go through [23–31].
The performance of the above NN-FL system largely depends on
those rules and different weights such as V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6, V7
and W1. The NNFL system will have variable structure only when
rule base of the FLC is optimized i.e., some rules are deleted. There
exist a large number of literatures for developing an optimal NNFL
system. In the present study two different approaches have been
adopted. Both these two approaches have been explained below
in brief.
2.3. Approach 1: Tuning using a BP algorithm
In this approach, RB is kept unaltered during its training. Only
the weights V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6, V7 and W1 are optimized using
BP algorithm [32]. It is usually implemented through the mini-
mization of Mean Squared Error (E) in prediction, as given below.

where T5c and O5c represent the target and model predicted outputs

2.4. Approach 2: Tuning using genetic algorithm
Approach 1 suffers from the local minima problem. Also, in
Approach 1,
only
the
weights
are
optimized.
Therefore, in
Approach 2, optimization of both DB and RB is attempted using a
GA. GA with 4454-bits long string is used for this purpose. Data

base is represented by ﬁrst 80 bits (10 bits for each variable). Rest
4374-bits are used to express the rule base (two bits to represent a
rule: 00 for medium, 01 and 10 for moderate and 11 for severe). A
string will look like the following.

The detailed working principle of combined GA-NN-FL is avail-
able in [20,22]. Since GA is a population based search and each
population is to be assigned a ﬁtness, mean squared error (refer
to Eq. (1)) in prediction of degree of depression is considered as
the ﬁtness for each population. GA aims at ﬁnding that particular
solution which gives lowest error in predicting degree of depres-
sion. Also, through this approach, it is possible to reduce the num-
ber of rules.
2.4.1. Identiﬁcation of redundant/unimportant rules
It is very difﬁcult for a doctor to remember a large number of
rules. Some of the GA-optimized rules may be redundant (are not
important) in the context of the problem. Therefore, it will be nicer
to eliminate them from the rule base. However, identiﬁcation of
redundant rules is difﬁcult. In this paper, we have planned to iden-
tify them using the concept of importance factor. Rules having rel-
atively low importance factors are called as redundant and may be
deleted from the rule base. It is to be done in such a way so that
non-ﬁring of rules does not occur.
Let us suppose that nij denotes the number of times that the jth
linguistic term (j = 1 for mild, j = 2 for moderate and j = 3 for sev-
ere) for the ith input condition (i.e., corresponding to different input
values) is ﬁred during training. In this way, total numbers of ﬁred
rules are represented by N. Thus, the probability of occurrence of
the jth linguistic term for the ith input condition may be given as
follows
pij ¼ nij
N ;
where i ¼ 1; 2; 3; . . . 2187 and j ¼ 1; 2; 3:
ð6Þ
The probability of occurrence of a rule will indicate the neces-
sity of keeping that rule in the RB. It is then multiplied with the
worth of a rule (i.e., contribution of any linguistic term towards
the output) to determine the importance factor. We have assumed
the worth of any linguistic term for the depression follow a Gaus-
sian distribution pattern. The maximum worth is taken to be equal
to 1 when error in prediction is zero. Otherwise it decreases with
the increase in error.
Let us say that, Cj is the worth of the jth linguistic term
Cj ¼
1
2p2 e

xj�1ﬃﬃ

p p
�
�2
ð7Þ
where xj ¼ 0:005 þ ðj � 1ÞW and W denotes the half of the triangu-
lar base of the data base and is different for different chromosomes
of GA. Thus the average worth over the optimization procedure is
taken into account for the determination of importance factor of a
rule.
The importance factor of a rule may be determined as follows

A particular rule is considered to be redundant if the impor-
tance factor of that rule is very low and can be eliminated only
when non-ﬁring does not arise. Let us understand the same
through an example. If we consider, S = 0.3, P = 0.3, W1 = 0.3,
I1 = 0.3, H = 0.3, A = 0.3 and P1 = 0.3. So, all the inputs can be clas-
siﬁed as either mild (m) or moderate (M) (refer to Fig. 2). Therefore,
at a time 27 = 128 rules out of existing 2187 rules will be ﬁred.
Now, out of those 128 rules, if one such rule is absent in the rule
base, there will be a non-ﬁring of such a rule. One training/test sce-
nario represents one input set, resulting in possibility of a maxi-
mum 128 non-ﬁring situations. Therefore, during training with
78 training cases, there is a possibility of 128 � 78 = 9984 non-
ﬁring situations, if for every case all the ﬁred rules are absent.
Moreover, FLC is tuned using GA, therefore, maximum possible
non-ﬁring
situations = maximum
number
of
generations �
populations � 9984.
3. Results and discussions
Two approaches as explained in Section 2 are used to train NN-
FL system. Out of the 88 data, 78 are used for training and 10 are
used for validation. During this process, all the weights are varied
in between 0.1 and 0.45. In Approach 1, learning rate (g) is system-
atically varied in range of 0.01–0.5 and result is noted. Fig. 3 shows
the variation of g with MSE and best result is obtained with
g = 0.05. This study is done considering the number of iterations
equal to 15. Lowest MSD is found to be equal to 0.0116043 (refer
to Fig. 4). Through this process optimal weights are found to be
V1 = 0.4161; V2 = 0.4469; V3 = 0.4507; V4 = 0.4469; V5 = 0.4405;
V6 = 0.4232; V7 = 0.4357 and W1 = 0.3425.

Three GA parameters inﬂuence the performance of Approach 2.
Therefore, GA parametric study is carried out systematically vary-
ing other parameters keeping one parameter constant for each run
of algorithm. During this process, crossover probability is set at 0.5.
The best mutation probability is determined varying it within
0.01–0.1 in a step of 0.01. Similarly, optimal number of GA popula-
tion is also obtained. Finally, with the best mutation probability
and population size, GA is run for 500 generations and optimal
parameters are noted. Figs. 5–7 show the corresponding results.
An attempt has also been made to identify the redundant rules
and thereafter those rules have been removed from the rule base.
The importance factors thus found for all the rules during the train-
ing is presented in Fig. 8. After removing certain number of rules
which were found to have lower values of importance factor, the
number of non-ﬁred scenarios and the corresponding errors for
both the training set (containing 78 data sets) and the test set (con-
taining 10 data sets) were calculated and tabulated in Table 2. Zero
non-ﬁred scenarios have been observed with the removal of 500
rules out of 2187 during test cases and only 25 non-ﬁred situations
happened for the training data-sets. Therefore, ﬁnal result has been
taken removing 500 rules from the rule-base. The reason behind
removing 500 rules is – (i) it does not give rise to any non-ﬁring sit-
uations of the rule base for the test cases and (ii) no further
improvement in error in prediction. It has been observed that there
exist three different zones of importance factors. Moreover, nearby
rules (say rule no 1819 and 1820) have same large importance fac-
tors. It might have happened because of the following reasons: (a)
there are only three linguistic terms representing depression (mild,
moderate and severe). Therefore, there could be three different
zones of the importance factor. Each zone will have some mean

and a range, (b) high value of importance factor means more num-
ber of ﬁring of such a rule during the process. Since we have con-
sidered triangular membership function distributions, which are
symmetric in nature, therefore, rules having linguistic terms mild
and moderate will have chance of ﬁring at the same time.
Following things have been observed in the rule base.
� Type A: 835 rules out of total 2187 rules have not been modiﬁed
by the GA. It clearly indicates that those are the rules in princi-
ple and even their important factor is low, still they can never
be omitted from the rule base. For example, Rule nos. 1822
and 1823 are of such a rule (refer to Table 3).
� Type B: 1106 rules out of total 2187 rules have been modiﬁed
slightly (i.e., mild to moderate, moderate to severe, moderate
to mild, severe to moderate). For example, Rule nos. 1795 and
1796 are of such a rule (refer to Table 3). It indicates that there
is a overlapping in the decision making process of the doctors
and they often could not clearly deﬁned the rules. Authors have
arranged these rules according to their importance factor and
deleted those which have low importance factor.

� Type C: 286 rules out of total 2187 rules have been modiﬁed lar-
gely (i.e., mild to severe and severe to mild, for example rule
nos. 1 and 9 of Table 3). These are hypersensitive rules and exis-
tence in the rule base causes wrong prediction. Therefore,
authors tried to eliminate those rules as a whole and have
noticed no change is observed in terms of non-ﬁring scenarios.
It is also important to mention that rule no. 1823 is the best rule
in terms of importance factor and it is also a rule in principle.
Table 4 shows the predicted depression values corresponding to
the ten test cases. Percentage error in prediction is found to be low
leaving the tenth case. It indicates that the developed model is a
good ﬁt one. Moreover, less percentage error is seen with Approach
2. It may be due to the optimized rule base in the Approach 2.
Performance of the best NN-FL system i.e., Approach 2 is com-
pared with a NN-based classiﬁer system. The NN-based system will
have a three layered 7-6-1 architecture and the results have been
presented in Table 5. It has been observed that the predicted
depression by Approach 2 is much closer to the target depression
compared to NN-based system. It may be due to the fact that
logic-based controller works well in modeling depression of
humans.
4. Conclusions and future work
In this study, an attempt has been made to develop a NNFL sys-
tem for diagnosing depression based on seven different symptoms.
Performance of NNFL-based diagnosing tool is improved through
GA-based optimization. Both rule base as well as data base has
been optimized using GA. Unfortunately, GA took huge time to
evolve the good solution. There are reported works which have
brought down the time consumed while running a GA-based opti-
mizer in machine automation. However, it is important to note
here that diagnosis of depression consumes months to get diag-
nosed even by an expert psychiatrist and therefore speed is out
of the scope of the paper. Still, to reduce the time the paper
attempts to identify the redundant rules and analysis has been
made to remove them by identifying the load of individual rules
on the morbidity. Finally, performance of the optimized GA-
tuned NNFL system is compared with that of back-propagation
based NNFL system for ten different cases. It was found that the
performance of GA-tuned NNFL system is better compared to the
other one. Moreover, it has been observed that GA-tuned NNFL sys-
tem has outperformed to a NN-based system. Therefore, Approach
2 can be of great help to the doctors for diagnosing the patients
suffering from depression.
Presently forward mapping has been between the symptoms
and the disease. However, it will be much more interesting if the
reverse mapping is made, where it will be possible to identify
the impact of a symptom on the disease. The authors are presently
working with this problem. It is also worth noting while reviewing
literature we have come across few works on the said problems.
