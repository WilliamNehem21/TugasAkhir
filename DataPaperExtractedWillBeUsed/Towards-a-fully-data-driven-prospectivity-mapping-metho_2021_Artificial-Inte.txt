Mineral exploration campaigns are ﬁnancially risky. Several state-of-the-art methods have been developed to
mitigate the risk, including predictive modelling of mineral prospectivity using principal component analysis
(PCA) and geographic information systems (GIS). The PCA and GIS approach is currently considered acceptable
for generating mineral exploration targets. However, some of its limitations are the dependence on sample
stoichiometry (e.g., the existence of minerals), the necessity of log-ratio transformations when dealing with
compositional data, and manual interpretation and use of principal components to enhance potential geochemical
anomalies for prospectivity mapping. In this study, we generalize the fundamental ideas behind the PCA and GIS
approach by developing a new data-driven approach using ML. We showcase a new workﬂow capable of
generating either intermediate evidence layers or ﬁnal prospectivity maps that depict major regional geochemical
anomalies using multi-element geochemical data from Southeastern Churchill Province (Qu�ebec and Labrador),
Canada. The region is known for its REEs endowment and the data were gathered for prospectivity mapping. A
comparison with the established multivariate hybrid data- and knowledge-based approach revealed that on a
roughly comparable basis of the amount of manual effort, our new data-driven procedure can much more
accurately identify geochemical anomalies in both univariate and multivariate applications. The results of our
prospectivity mapping corroborate with the ground truth or known geological anomalies in the studied region.
These ﬁndings have potentially wider implications on exploration target generation, where project risks (ﬁnan-
cial, environmental, political, etc.) and geochemical anomalies must be quantiﬁed using robust and effective data-
driven approaches. In addition, our methodology is more replicable and objective, as manual geoscientiﬁc
interpretation is not required during the detection of geochemical anomalies.
1. Introduction
Prospectivity mapping transforms geoscientiﬁc data into maps that
depict regional potential or favourability of deposits or their proxies (e.g.,
indicator elements) using some combination of knowledge- and data-
driven methods (e.g., Chung and Agterberg, 1980; Bonham-Carter,
1994; Harris and Pan, 1999; Wright and Bonham-Carter, 1996; Brown
et al., 2000; Carranza et al., 2008; Harris et al., 2015; Grunsky and de
Caritat, 2019). A key outcome is to delineate interesting regions (e.g.,
anomalies) that can be preferentially targeted for further investigation
and interpretation. Knowledge-driven approaches use heuristic models of
discipline-speciﬁc knowledge, such as characteristics of a deposit being
sought to guide the use of data (e.g., geochemical and geophysical maps).
Data-driven approaches often makes use of existing ground truth to train
exploration models (Bonham-Carter, 1994; Wright and Bonham-Carter,
1996; Carranza, 2008, 2009a, b), which renders such methods more
suitable for brownﬁeld than greenﬁeld exploration. However, the dis-
covery of spatially-coherent geochemical anomalies is a type of anomaly
detection task that can occur in some combination of the variable and the
spatial space using unsupervised machine learning, which does not
require ground truth. A data-driven technique based on multivariate
statistical methods to discover anomalous processes exists (e.g., Carra-
nza, 2008; Grunsky and de Caritat, 2019). However, it requires manual
interpretation and therefore relies on some discipline knowledge. This

method (“the multivariate method”, e.g., Carranza, 2008; Grunsky and
de Caritat, 2019) may be generalized using machine learning methods
that weakens the technique's reliance on geoscientiﬁc knowledge and
manual interpretation. In this paper, we demonstrate a generalization of
the variable- and geospatial-space based anomaly detection using
compositional geochemical data that removes some key weaknesses of
the multivariate method and does not require ground truth (of anoma-
lies). Therefore, our technique could be used for either greenﬁeld or
brownﬁeld exploration.
Exploration geochemical data contains spatial information and sam-
ple chemistry (e.g., of bedrock, glacial till, water, soil, stream and lake
sediment) and is intended to capture the effects of geological processes
that may control elemental distribution, such as lithological variability,
metamorphic or hydrothermal overprinting and other secondary pro-
cesses. Some processes may be responsible for chemical anomalies that
are associated with the presence of mineral deposits (Grunsky and de
Caritat, 2019). Where sample chemistry is multivariate in the form of
compositional data, concentrations are reported as relative proportions.
A data-driven technique can identify geochemical anomalies using
compositional data (Harris et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2018; Grunsky and de
Caritat, 2019; Grunsky and Arne, 2020). However, the method as sum-
marized by Grunsky and de Caritat (2019) exhibits some key weaknesses.
The ﬁrst is the assumption of geochemistry as a proxy for mineralogy
through elemental stoichiometry, which may be unmet in some cases
(e.g., volcanic or clay-rich rocks and/or in highly altered areas, see Zhang
et al., 2021). As the strength of mineralogy-controlled variability
weakens, the ability to produce useful and interpretable multivariate
elemental associations is gradually lost. Although this does not nullify the
technique in such situations, it does increase the burden of manual
interpretation and validation. The second is the use of manual geological
and geochemical interpretation of key stoichiometries, which increases
mapping subjectivity and renders this method more knowledge-driven
(Carranza, 2008; Harris et al., 2015, Chen et al., 2018; Grunsky and de
Caritat, 2019). This results from a reliance on principal component
analysis (PCA), in a manner that is more resemblant of multivariate
statistical analysis than machine learning (ML; e.g., Carranza, 2008; Zuo,
2011; Harris et al., 2015; Grunsky and de Caritat, 2019). For data-driven
approaches, PCA serves two main purposes: (1) a reduction of feature
space dimensionality, and (2) an automation of the extraction of multi-
variate relationships. Where PCA is applied to geochemical data to
extract multivariate relationships, the interpretation of principal com-
ponents is unavoidable, in order to discriminate between background
processes and anomalous (e.g., deposit-forming) processes (Carranza,
2008; Zuo, 2011; Grunsky et al., 2014; Harris et al., 2015; Grunsky and
de Caritat, 2019). In contrast to this method (e.g., Grunsky and de Car-
itat., 2019), there exists a collection of deep learning-based approaches to
the generation of prospectivity maps (Zuo et al., 2019 and references
therein). Such methods use highly abstract and powerful neural networks
to extract patterns that may be indicative of relevant geological pro-
cesses. These approaches are perhaps the highest in performance
(exceeding human performance, Zuo et al., 2019) and as such, are at the
leading-edge of data-driven applications in many ﬁelds (e.g., He et al.,
2015 and Lundervold and Lundervold, 2019). However, they produce
models that are inherently complex and difﬁcult to interpret (Zuo et al.,
2019) and in response to this, an entire ﬁeld of explainable artiﬁcial
intelligence exists and is driven by the need to be able to understand
decisions (e.g., Linardatos et al., 2021). For exploration, the uncertainty
of prospectivity maps is generally an unsolved problem, which can be
compounded by the lack of explain-ability of complex ML models (e.g.,
neural networks and ensembles). However, it is possible to simulta-
neously leverage desirable aspects of algorithmically simpler approaches
that invoke some in-discipline knowledge (Grunsky and de Caritat,
2019), while accommodating complex and powerful algorithms (e.g.,
Luo et al., 2020 and Zuo et al., 2019 and references therein). To this
effect, we develop and generalize the Grunsky and de Caritat (2019)
technique using ML to automatically delineate geochemical anomalies in
a manner that both overcomes the method's major weaknesses and
explicitly make provisions for the use of many ML algorithms. The latter

2. Background and regional geology
Our data resulted from lake sediment sampling of the Southeastern
Fig. 2. Simpliﬁed bedrock geology map of the study area (UTM Zone 20, NAD 83). Lake sediment samples used in this study are all located in Labrador (NTS 13-L, 13-
M, 14-D, 23-I and 23-J). The Mistastin Batholith (labelled MB) is located at the provincial boundary between Qu�ebec and Labrador (near center of the map).

Churchill Province, which is at the border between northern Qu�ebec and
Labrador (Fig. 1). It is a glaciated landscape that is under exploration for
rare earth elements (REEs), which centers around the Strange Lake per-
alkaline complex (Fig. 2). Anomalies in lake sediments and lake waters as
well as gamma-ray spectrometry led to the discovery of the Strange Lake
deposit in 1980 (Friske et al., 1996a, b; Zajac, 2015), which is one of the
world's largest deposits of Zr, Y and heavy REEs (Zajac, 2015). REEs are
critical to modern societies due to their role in the high-tech, trans-
portation and energy sectors (Balaram, 2019), and the need to diversify
supply chains to mitigate geopolitical instability (Balaram, 2019; Over-
land, 2019). For these reasons, the European Union, United States of
America, Australia, People's Republic of China and Canada have enacted
legislation and policies to secure their supply chains of REEs (European
Commission, 2011, 2014, 2017a, 2017b, 2020; Ghorbani, 2018; U.S.
Geological Survey, 2018; Rizzo et al., 2020; Natural Resources Canada,
2021). Prior knowledge of the Strange Lake deposit provides the
necessary, albeit qualitative ground truth for the veriﬁcation of
geochemical anomaly maps.
The Southeastern Churchill Province is an elongated sliver of Archean
to early-Paleoproterozoic continental crust that was accreted during the
Paleoproterozoic, through collision of the Superior (to the west) and
North Atlantic (to the east) cratons (Fig. 1; James et al., 1996; James and
Dunning, 2000; Wardle et al., 2002; Hammouche et al., 2012; Corrigan
et al., 2018). To the west, the southeastern Churchill Province is ﬂanked
by the New Qu�ebec Orogen (1.83–1.80 Ga; Hoffman, 1988; Perreault and
Hynes, 1990; Moorhead and Hynes, 1990) and to the east by the Torngat
Orogen (1.87–1.86 Ga; Wardle et al., 2002). The extent to which these
orogens affected the Core Zone (Fig. 1) is relatively unknown, although
the New Qu�ebec Orogen overprint appears to be more widespread
(Corrigan et al., 2018). As a result of the accretion, numerous folds and
large shear zones transect the region (Fig. 1). Rocks in the area consist
mostly of paragneiss, orthogneiss, migmatite and low-to medium--
metamorphic grade supracrustal and plutonic rocks that were intruded
by post-orogen, Mesoproterozoic-age intrusions (Hammouche et al.,
2012; Corrigan et al., 2018).
The Mistastin Batholith (C27 in Fig. 2; 1400 Ga), which outcrops as
two semi-circular intrusions covering an area of 5600 km2, is of partic-
ular importance in the study area (Hammouche et al., 2012). The largest
of the intrusions by planar dimensions (to the south) is ellipsoid-shaped
(long axis striking at N20E) and measures approximately 144 by 65 km.
To the north is a smaller, circularly-shaped intrusion, measuring
approximately 26 by 27 km. The Mistastin Batholith is chieﬂy composed
of intermediate potassic intrusive rocks with lesser amounts of monzo-
nite, quartz syenite, granite, anorthosite, leucogabbronorite and leuco-
gabbro (Van der Leeden, 1995). Notably, this batholith is locally highly
enriched in REEs, Zr, Y, � Be, Nb, U and Th (Hammouche et al., 2012).
One of these zones of enrichment is hosted by the Misery Lake

peralkaline syenite (C27a in Fig. 2; 1409.7 � 1.2 Ma), located in the
southern portion of the largest intrusion (David et al., 2012). The most
notable deposit known is hosted by the Strange Lake peralkaline complex
(C27b in Fig. 2; 1240 � 2Ma) with indicated mineral resources of 278 Mt
at 0.93% total REE oxide (Miller, 1990; Gowans et al., 2014; Zajac,
2015).
The batholith is highly weathered, likely due to intensive hydro-
thermal alteration in zones associated with REE-mineralization prior to
Quaternary glaciation events. Glacial erosion by the Laurentide Ice Sheet
throughout the Wisconsin glaciation remobilized the hydrothermally
altered bedrocks and along with it, large volumes of REE-rich debris
towards the northeast. Lake sediment and lake water geochemistry,
boulder mapping, matrix till geochemistry, indicator minerals and
airborne gamma-ray spectroscopy data reveal that the dispersal trend can
be detected in excess of 50 km down ice (Geological Survey of Canada,
1980; Batterson, 1989; Zajac, 2015; Paulen et al., 2017; McClenaghan
et al., 2017, 2019).
3. Methods
3.1. Source data
The lake sediment geochemical data used for this study, the sampling
protocol, analytical methodology, quality control and quality assurance
procedures are documented in McCurdy et al. (2016). The survey consists
of 3441 samples, including ﬁeld duplicates, and was sampled at a reso-
lution of about one sample per 13 km2. The data used in this study is from
a campaign to re-analyze lake sediment samples using modern analytical
methods as part of the Geological Survey of Canada's GEM program
(GEM, 2019). Geochemical analyses were conducted at Bureau Veritas in
Vancouver, Canada. A total of 65 elements were analyzed: Ag, Al, As, Au,
B, Ba, Be, Bi, Ca, Cd, Ce, Co, Cr, Cs, Cu, Dy, Er, Eu, Fe, Ga, Gd, Ge, Hf, Hg,
Ho, In, K, La, Li, Lu, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Nb, Nd, Ni, P, Pb, Pd, Pr, Pt, Rb, Re,
S, Sb, Sc, Se, Sm, Sn, Sr, Ta, Tb, Te, Th, Ti, Tl, Tm, U, V, W, Y, Yb, Zn and
Zr. All trace elements are presented in parts per million (ppm) and major
elements in weight percent (wt %). Pulped samples were digested using a
modiﬁed aqua regia solution (an equiproportional mixture of HCl, HNO3
and H2O) for 1 h in a hot water bath (95 �C). After cooling, the solution
was made up to a ﬁnal volume with 5% HCl and analyzed using an
ICP-mass spectrometer (McCurdy et al., 2016). Reliability as assessed by
accuracy and precision of the data was determined using ﬁeld duplicates,
analytical duplicates and certiﬁed reference materials. Field duplicates
were further used to determine the suitability of the data for regional
mapping on a per-element basis through an application of Analysis of
Variance (ANOVA). The lake sediment geochemical data are intended to
capture lithological variation, secondary processes such as alteration and
geochemical anomalies related to bedrock mineralization. For one of our
workﬂows, the data was transformed using centered log-ratio (CLR)
(Aitchison, 1982). Censored data were replaced with half the detection
limit. For a discussion on the appropriateness of the application and ef-
fect of log-ratio transformations, particularly as it pertains to data
embedding (e.g., feature space geometry), algorithm selection and per-
formance impacts for our intended ML task of geochemical anomaly
detection, see Zhang et al. (2021).
3.2. Predictive modelling and mapping
Within the explainable data-driven prospectivity mapping methods,
PCA is a common algorithm, since it re-coordinates data along directions
of variability, and reduces the dimensionality of chemical coordinates
(Carranza, 2008; Zuo, 2011; Grunsky et al., 2014; Harris et al., 2015;
Grunsky and de Caritat., 2019). For samples that are mostly composed of
minerals, the inter-sample chemical variability is dominated by the
variability of mineral composition and chemistry. Hence, the regional
geochemical variability can be captured by principal components, which
essentially describe key combinations of sample stoichiometries. These
multivariate relationships are likely to be reliable for further use, if they
are spatially coherent (Grunsky, 2010). Major components may capture
regional lithological variability, alteration and mineralization (Grunsky
and Smee, 1999; Grunsky, 2010), whereas lesser components likely
capture under-sampled or random processes. Eigenvectors are typically
manually interpreted (e.g., Grunsky et al., 2014). Thereafter, models can
be built for exploration purposes, such as regression residual maps of an
element of interest against the components (e.g., Harris et al., 2015; Arne
et al., 2018; Grunsky and de Caritat, 2019).

For our purpose, we showcase the effectiveness of a ML-based tech-
nique for prospectivity mapping as developed by Zhang et al. (2021),
which makes use of ML to predict trace elemental concentrations using
major and minor elemental concentrations. They observed that the
trained models effectively serve as geochemical baselines, such that the
relative size of geochemical anomalies are proportional to the prediction
residuals (predicted minus actual). Maps produced using the prediction
residuals

suppressing large regional variability and increasing contrast between
geochemical anomalies and the background (Zhang et al., 2021). A key
discipline-speciﬁc recognition made by Zhang et al. (2021) was that
different elements carried different classes of geoscientiﬁc information –
major and minor elements carry the rock-forming information of sam-
ples, whereas trace elements carry information regarding geological and
geochemical processes that may not be related to rock-forming (or even
secondary) processes. Therefore, using rock-forming elements as ML
features (predictors) and trace elements as targets effectively automates
the building of geochemical baselines that are capable of suppression of
large-scaled (e.g., lithological) variability in the trace element data. This
can be considered a form of discipline-speciﬁc feature engineering in the
ML context or knowledge application in the prospectivity mapping
context. In our observation, this application of discipline-speciﬁc
knowledge effectively removes the requirement to manually delineate
pervasive background processes and targeted anomalies (e.g., using
eigenvector interpretation).
Following Zhang et al. (2021), we use major and minor elemental
concentrations to predict the concentrations of the trace elements under
similar assumptions as Grunsky and de Caritat (2019), in that regional
lithology and secondary processes have high explanatory power for a
majority of the observed geochemical variability. In this manner, we
assume that the key variabilities in lithology, alteration and minerali-
zation are captured by the data of major and minor elemental concen-
trations. Hence, anomalies that by deﬁnition, cannot be explained by the
rock-forming elements must constitute either noise or additional
geological or geochemical processes, some of which are probably asso-
ciated with mineralization processes that are of further exploration in-
terest. In our technique, the trained ML models serve as implicit and
dynamic (they are capable of predicting trace elemental concentrations
across many lithologies or rock types, see Zhang et al., 2021) regional
geochemical baselines and the prediction residuals are the deviations in
elemental concentrations. Although supervised methods are used, they
are strictly used to build geochemical baselines and are not used to train

ML algorithms to recognize anomalies by example. Hence, our anomaly
detection method is unsupervised, as anomalies in the area are known to
exist (and have been studied extensively) but the data is unlabelled.
Against the baselines on a per-element basis, negative prediction re-
siduals (prediction is less than actual) implies that there is an excess
concentration above the regional baseline that by deﬁnition, cannot be
explained by one or more models. The choice of the sign of prediction
residuals is arbitrary and depends on how the residuals are calculated
(actual minus predicted or predicted minus actual). The quality of the
model would be maximized through algorithm selection and parameter
tuning, to minimize the prediction residuals using a metric. A more
explanatory model better suppresses the large-scale variability in the
data compared to less explanatory models. As such, the more explanatory
power of the model, the more selective the resulting anomalies in
geographical space. Furthermore, the explain-ability of the models can be
explicitly balanced against model performance on a per-application
basis. This implies that the regional geochemical baseline can be tuned
through model selection and model tuning. In our approach, more than
one algorithm is used to predict a single element, the best performing
algorithm and model can be used for each element (alternatively, a
one-algorithm-ﬁts-all approach is feasible to reduce computational re-
quirements). Univariate maps of prediction residuals for each trace
element can be produced for direct use as anomaly maps or as interme-
diate evidence layers for other methods that follow this stage. To produce
multivariate anomaly maps, an algorithm such as PCA can be used to
summarize the major anomalies in the region. In this case, a multivariate
map that is produced from the best performing combination of models is
a stacked output of multiple algorithms over multiple elements. Spatially
coherent areas of negative prediction residuals are regions of anomalous
elemental enrichment, which are worthy of further investigation.
Detection of depletion processes are also theoretically possible, although
this aspect is unexplored in this paper. Since qualitative ground truth
exists in the area (e.g., known targets are REEs and a dispersal trend is
well-documented), it is possible to understand the validity of our results.
We created a ML workﬂow that implements data preprocessing,
predictive modelling and visualization. For the purpose of this study, the
features were all the major and minor elements (Fe, Mg, Al, Ca, Na, K, Ti,
P, S). For our ML task, it is not important whether the features are CLR-
transformed or not as part of feature engineering (Hastie et al., 2009;
Domingos, 2012), since it is not expected to signiﬁcantly alter the pre-
dictive modelling performance across a range of ML algorithms (studied
in more detail in Zhang et al., 2021). However, for one of our workﬂows,
we utilized the CLR transformation to enable a parallel multivariate
modelling approach for comparison purposes and also to compare the
results between the uses of raw and CLR-transformed ML features. After
the CLR transformation, the features were rescaled, such that each
feature spans an equal numerical range. During the predictive modelling
stage, the features were used to train regression algorithms (Russell and
Norvig, 2010). The regression algorithms used in this study include:
k-nearest neighbors (Cover and Hart, 1967; Fix and Hodges, 1951; Kot-
siantis et al., 2007; Witten and Frank, 2005), random forests (Ho, 1995;
Breiman, 1996a, 1996b; Kotsiantis, 2014; Freund and Schapire, 1995;
Sagi and Rokach, 2018), elastic net (Santosa and William, 1986; Tib-
shirani, 1996; Tikhonov, 1943; Zou and Hastie, 2005), support vector
machine (SVM; Vapnik, 1998; Hsu and Lin, 2002; Karatzoglou et al.,
2006), adaptive boosting of decision trees (AdaBoost; Freund and Scha-
pire, 1995) and artiﬁcial neural networks (neuronet; Hastie et al., 2009;
Curry, 1944; Lemar�echal, 2012; Rosenblatt, 1961; Rumelhart et al.,
1986; Cybenko, 1989). For a detailed description of these algorithms,
their assumptions on the feature space properties (e.g., Euclidean ge-
ometry and its associated metric) and their parameters, see Zhang et al.
(2021).
For model selection and tuning, we employed cross-validation. To
detect anomalies in our technique, cross-validation is not strictly
required as mathematical induction would not occur and instead a
geochemical baseline (a ﬁtted model) is required. Deviations from the
baseline can be measured through a metric, e.g., prediction residuals.
However, to understand the prediction performance, model generaliz-
ability and to prevent over-ﬁtting (exaggeration of the baselines), we use
cross-validation to perform algorithm selection and model tuning. We
employ the coefﬁcient of determination (CoD) metric to assess prediction
accuracy. The choice of the performance metric is important to anomaly
detection, as the CoD metric is sensitive to outliers and therefore, opti-
mizing the prediction performance using the CoD metric implies that the
geochemical baseline is tuned to suppress outliers and therefore, this
optimization suppresses the models’ sensitivity to sparsely sampled

anomalies. The median absolute prediction error (MAPE) is a measure of
median prediction error and here we use it as an additional metric to
proﬁle prediction performance but not to perform algorithm selection or
model tuning. We used an exhaustive grid search (see Table 1) combined
with an n-fold cross validation (n ¼ 4) to determine the rank-order of
algorithms. The ﬁrst 3 top performing algorithms per element are then
used to produce prediction results using 10-fold cross-validation over
100 runs. The results were thereafter averaged and the prediction re-
siduals were calculated for each performance level, for each element.
Subsequently, the prediction results were used in two ways to generate
geochemical anomaly maps, the ﬁrst uses either weighted evidence
layers of prediction residual maps or single element residual maps, which
simulates a knowledge-based method to combine evidence layers to
target one or more speciﬁc indicator elements. The second uses a PCA-
based method to generate a linear combination of prediction residuals
(across all elements predicted and using a variety of algorithms for a
given performance level) to create maps of the most signiﬁcant
multivariate geochemical anomalies.
Our method further advances the data-driven aspect of prospectivity
mapping using compositional geochemical data (Grunsky and de Caritat,
2019), as it does not assume underlying stoichiometries nor require
principal component interpretation. In addition, our procedure allows for
any regression algorithm to be used, and does not assume linearity of
elemental relationships, which means that our procedure can incorporate
a range of parametric, non-parametric and linear-, nonlinear and neural
network-based algorithms and the quality of the mapping would be
directly linked to the performance of the algorithms and models, and is
not linked to the interpretability of eigenvectors, operator expertise or
discipline-speciﬁc
knowledge.
Lastly,
we
demonstrate
that
the
CLR-transformation is unnecessary for our technique.

unpredictable (CoD <0.1) due to pervasive data censoring. Hence, they
were excluded from further analyses and mapping. Comparison of results
between those using the raw versus the CLR-transformed data demon-
strate that on average, the raw data produces more accurate predictions
(Fig. 3). The best algorithm and its optimal hyperparameters depend on
the target element and the type of data used (Fig. 4, see also Table 2).
However, within the parameter grid, the random forest regressor is
generally the best using either CLR-transformed or raw data (Fig. 4). This
is interesting, since the random forest algorithm is not spatially aware in
the feature space and therefore, there is no heuristic to suggest any
speciﬁc embedding geometry. No obvious trends exist for second- and
third-best algorithms. However, SVM, Neuronet and AdaBoost tends to
perform better than k-nearest neighbors and elastic net, although the
performance differential between all algorithms is typically a few percent
and sometimes identical to two decimal places. Therefore, complex
models can be substituted by simpler and more explainable models with
minor losses of anomaly selectivity. The use of the CoD metric implies
that the prediction performance is heavily affected by outliers. However,
this is desirable if the prediction residuals would be used to detect
anomalies, in which case, it is less risky to suppress large anomalies than
to generate more false positives. The prediction results show a systematic
under-prediction at higher concentrations for REE indicator elements in
the region (as identiﬁed in McClenaghan et al., 2017), such as Th, La, Tm
and Y (Fig. 5). This implies that rock-forming elements are insufﬁcient to
explain higher concentrations of REE indicator elements, which likely
contain true regional geochemical anomalies, if they are also spatially
coherent. Hence, there are likely less well-sampled geological and
geochemical processes operating in the region that enriched some sam-
ples with REEs relative to the geochemical baseline. Moreover, there is a
general consensus between various algorithms and their best models on
the relative size of the geochemical anomalies (the prediction residuals
are often statistically similar).

For process validation and to demonstrate an integration of our
technique with knowledge-driven methods, we created maps of the
original concentrations and the prediction residuals for two groups of
elements – REEs (Sc, Y, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb
and Lu) and chalcophiles (Cu, Zn, Ga, As, Se, Sn, Sb, Te, Bi, Tl, Pb, In, Hg,
Cd, Ge and Ag). For mapping, only elements that exhibited reliable
directional semivariograms that can be ﬁtted with spherical models were
used. The extent of the maps was chosen to contain the west-to-east
glacial dispersal trend (Geological Survey of Canada, 1980; Batterson,
1989; Zajac, 2015; Paulen et al., 2017; McClenaghan et al., 2017, 2019).
Element maps were stacked using per-layer normalization and uniform
weighting, to give each element an equal inﬂuence on the ﬁnal map.
Final maps of the prediction residuals and the elemental concentrations
show similar patterns; however, the residual map is less noisy and more
selective, which results in higher visible contrast (Figs. 6 and 7). The
dispersal trend is not visible for the chalcophile elemental maps, but is
visible in the REE-maps (Fig. 7).
There are other methods to create anomaly maps, depending on the
nature of the exploration (greenﬁeld or brownﬁeld). In a brownﬁeld
setting (or e.g., where there are known target elements), anomalies of
indicator or deposit-vectoring elements can be mapped, e.g., univariate
prediction residual maps. For greenﬁeld exploration, an additional step is
required
to
automatically
extract
the
most
prominent
regional
geochemical anomalies. For this purpose, many algorithms are available,
such as PCA. However, unlike the application of PCA in multivariate
geochemical process discovery (e.g., Carranza, 2008; Grunsky and de
Caritat, 2019), the principal components of prediction residuals are only
expected to contain geochemical anomalies at the scale of the survey. To
within model capability, regional variability for all trace elements that
can be modelled by multivariate elemental associations using major and
minor elements have been removed. Therefore, there is no need to
interpret eigenvectors for mapping, beyond an understanding the
composition of anomalies. We produced two sets of maps using a
multivariate method (e.g., Grunsky and de Caritat, 2019) and our tech-
nique. The steps to accomplish both are summarized in Fig. 8.
For a univariate comparison, we chose to compare maps of Y anom-
alies produced from the multivariate and our methods. For the former
method we constructed principal components from CLR-transformed
data and veriﬁed that the ﬁrst few principal components capture large-
scaled geochemical variation. Subsequently, we used a multilinear
regression of the Y concentration against the ﬁrst few principal
components to produce regression residuals that were mapped (Fig. 9).
Maps produced using this method, up to principal component 3 are
qualitatively identical with the contrast maximized using principal
component 1. For our method, the Y prediction residuals were directly
mapped (Fig. 10). A comparison of the two maps shows that the map
produced using our method captures the glacial dispersal trend
emanating from the Strange Lake peralkaline intrusion and corresponds
to the pattern previously identiﬁed using gamma-ray spectrometry, lake
sediments and lake waters. In comparison, the multivariate method
yields a Y-enrichment pattern that is similar to the glacial dispersal trend
in the west, but connects to a large body to the east. This large body is
unobserved using our technique and undocumented in previous studies
of the glacial dispersal trend using boulder mapping, matrix till
geochemistry, indicator minerals and airborne gamma-ray spectroscopy
data (Geological Survey of Canada, 1980; Batterson, 1989; Zajac, 2015;
Paulen et al., 2017; McClenaghan et al., 2017, 2019).
For a multivariate comparison, it is impossible to compare maps of
principal components of anomalies against those produced by the
multivariate method, since these sets of principal components have
different meanings. Instead, we make a comparison between the two
groups on a basis of roughly the same amount of manual effort (which we
deem a fair criterion, as methods that are less data-driven can be arbi-
trarily reﬁned using better knowledge). For both methods, one or more of
the principal components should contain known regional geochemical
anomalies – the REE dispersal trend. Hence, we chose maps produced by
all methods that exhibited the highest resemblance of the dispersal trend.
For our method, the highest performing algorithms produced results that
(see Fig. 4) feature a single dominant principal component (principal
component 1), which captures approximately 24.74% of the region's
anomalies. For the multivariate method, principal component 1 explains
32.42% of the data's variability (Fig. 11). The highest resemblance be-
tween the principal component maps occurred for principal components
1 of both methods (with a manual examination of the multivariate
method's principal components up to number 6) (Figs. 12 and 13). It is
clear that the map of principal component 1, derived from the multi-
variate method reﬂects regional geochemical variability (Fig. 12). Prin-
cipal component-1 map using the multivariate method is insufﬁcient for
further exploration targeting and typically, additional procedures, such
as a linear discriminant analysis or elemental regressions against a
principal component(s), would be used to further reﬁne desirable
exploration targets (e.g., desirable lithologies). In comparison, our

method yields a regional anomaly map that is sufﬁciently selective to be
used for further exploration targeting, especially if combined with
glaciation striation directions (Fig. 13).
Anomaly maps that are produced using the raw data, using our
method, generally exhibit an increase in overall contrast and particularly
in the intensity of the anomalies in the Strange Lake and Mistastin vi-
cinity relative to those produced using the CLR-transformed data,
although the differences are unsubstantial (results of the best combina-
tions of algorithms visualized in Figs. 13 and 14). Based on the perfor-
mance comparison between the two workﬂows (Fig. 3), this is expected,
since the models using the raw data are generally higher performing.
There is a trend of a loss of anomaly selectivity (e.g., anomalous regions
become
larger)
with
the
use
of
lower
performance
algorithms
(Figs. 13–18) across the three best combinations (as depicted in Fig. 4).
The loss in selectivity appears to be somewhat less pronounced for CLR-
transformed data using the third-best combination of algorithms, how-
ever the contrast remains greater for the map that was derived from the
workﬂow using raw data (Figs. 17 and 18).
5. Discussion
5.1. Geological interpretation and validity of the observed trends
The glacial dispersal trend associated with REE-enriched Strange Lake
peralkaline complex is well known and has been extensively documented
(Geological Survey of Canada, 1980; Batterson, 1989; Zajac, 2015;
Paulen et al., 2017; McClenaghan et al., 2017, 2019). Both univariate
prospectivity maps of Y (and similarly for other indicator elements) using
the multivariate method (i.e., Grunsky and de Caritat, 2019) and our
procedure (Figs. 9 and 10, respectively) clearly demonstrate that a
consistent and cohesive pattern is detectable in the lake sediment
geochemical data. Lake sediment geochemical data elemental distribu-
tion patterns are known to mimic those of glacial till, as indicator min-
erals and fragments of mineralization found in glacial till inevitably
migrate into local drainage systems where they settle/precipitate into
lakes (McConnell and Batterson 1987; Cameron, 1994). In prospectivity
maps produced using our technique, the dispersal trend can be traced for
Fig. 12. Map of principal component 1, using the multivariate method. Included in the regional prospectivity map are the lithological boundaries (Fig. 2) and glacial
dispersion trends (black arrows). Abbreviations: Strange Lake peralkaline intrusion (SL); Mistastin Batholith (MB). The glacial dispersal trend from the REE-bearing
Strange Lake intrusion is poorly distinguishable from the background.

approximately 100 km to the northeast. This distance is in agreement
with that of previous studies. However, compared to the multivariate
method, both our univariate and multivariate prospectivity maps clearly
highlight another previously undocumented dispersal trend originating
from the southern portion of the Mistastin Batholith (Figs. 10 and 13).
Recent mapping and exploration of the southern portions of the Mistastin
Batholith in 2010 by Quest Rare Minerals and Midland Exploration have
found a number REE-bearing deposits that also contain Zr, Y, U, Th, Be,
Pb and Nb (Hammouche et al., 2012). Glacial erosion features in the
southern portions of the Mistastin Batholith strike N65E, which corre-
sponds to the glacial dispersion trend emanating from the batholith. It
therefore appears that the dispersal train originating from the southern
portion of the Mistastin Batholith is also detectable in the lake sediment
geochemical data. However, the composition of the dispersal trends is
different between the southern and the northern dispersal trends. A full
interpretation of the region's geochemical anomalies is out of the scope of
this paper. Lastly, another less-prominent anomaly can be seen southwest
of the Mistastin Batholith (Figs. 10 and 13). A geological investigation in
the area does not reveal any known deposits or lithologies that could be
associated with REE, Zr, Y, � Be, Nb, U, Th deposits. Furthermore, the
anomaly is not associated with the local glacial dispersal trend (towards
the southeast). Therefore, further work in the area would be required to
identify the nature of this anomaly.
5.2. Anomaly detection-based prospectivity mapping
There have been many approaches to using geochemical composi-
tional data, much of it within the multivariate domain. For the purpose of
prospectivity mapping, the key goal is to produce maps that correctly
identify, with as high selectivity as possible, true geochemical anomalies
that are invariably indicative of the locations of mineral occurrences.
Although the deﬁnition of geochemical anomaly has not changed, the
methods used to delineate baselines from anomalies have continued to
evolve and improve. There has been a general trend of further adoption

are the lithological boundaries (Fig. 2) and glacial dispersion trends (black arrows). Abbreviations: Strange Lake peralkaline intrusion (SL); Mistastin Batholith (MB).
The glacial dispersal trend from the REE-bearing Strange Lake intrusion is visible and extends approximately 100 km to the northeast. Furthermore, another glacial
dispersal trend is visible extending 140 km northeast from the southern portion of the Mistastin Batholith.

of data-driven techniques, which can complement or replace knowledge-
driven techniques, and especially in brownﬁeld exploration, because the
existence of at least partial ground truth allows for model validation. A
general change in the discipline of geochemical exploration has been
towards larger regional surveys, higher quality data and more capable
and sometimes more complex data modelling methods. Consistent with
this trend, in this study, we build upon the multivariate modelling
approach as demonstrated in Grunsky and de Caritat (2019) by gener-
alizing the idea of geochemical anomaly detection, automating much of
the data analytics and modelling using a modern ML-based pipeline and
removing the intermediary steps that require traditional geological and
geochemical interpretation (i.e., of the principal components). Conse-
quently, as a product of our approach:
(a) we do not require log-ratio transformations for geochemical
anomaly detection, although they facilitate a parallel workﬂow
that uses multivariate modelling methods for comparison;
(b) we do not assume the existence of minerals or stoichiometry in the
data, which implies that our technique is more broadly applicable
and does not require interpretation of stoichiometries (as
demonstrated using volcanic rock geochemical data in Zhang
et al., 2021);
(c) we are able to directly map prediction residuals of any combina-
tion of elements to produce prospectivity maps that are more se-
lective and less noisy than that of the multivariate approach;
(d) we are able to produce multivariate prospectivity maps that do not
require extensive manual interpretation and the resulting maps
are substantially more selective and reﬂective of the ‘ground
truth’;
(e) we do not require log-ratio feature transformations and therefore
remove the necessity for data imputation.
A key functional difference in our approach compared to the multi-
variate method is that we utilize ML extensively and designed our

prospectivity map are the lithological boundaries (Fig. 2) and glacial dispersion trends (black arrows). Abbreviations: Strange Lake peralkaline intrusion (SL); Mistastin

workﬂow to be agnostic of speciﬁc algorithms. The function of the ML
algorithms as a data pre-processor for multivariate modelling is to
automate the construction of a regional geochemical baseline, against
which, all anomalies are measured. The choice of algorithm and model
are entirely automated, and the best algorithm and model parameters are
built without manual interpretation of regional geology (e.g., lithology or
alteration) or knowledge of the type of mineral deposit being sought. In
addition, ground truth is not required to train the models (as the anomaly
detection method is unsupervised). This means that the quality of the
geochemical
baseline,
and
therefore
the
value
of
the
detected
geochemical anomalies is dependent on the quality of the predictive
modelling. Models with high explanatory powers (e.g., a high CoD)
translate to reliable regional geochemical baselines. As such, a weakness
of our approach lies in that most of the data should capture non-
anomalous regional geochemistry. Since the baselines and anomalies
are determined through the data using ML algorithms, the deﬁnition of
anomaly is not a knowledge-driven one and changes depending on the
data used to train the models. This is unavoidable and delegates the
interpretation of the nature of the anomalies (what elements are in them)
to the users of the prospectivity maps, where anomalous compositions
would have to be understood regardless of the method of discovery. Our
results show that a single principal component of the prediction residuals
immediately produces a map that qualitatively agrees with the regional
ground truth (the Strange Lake peralkaline intrusion REE glacial
dispersal trend). Compared to a similar application of PCA in the multi-
variate method, we do not require additional principal components to be
mapped, interpreted, or further manipulated, at least for this dataset.
This is because the ML algorithm training that occurred during the pre-
dictive
modelling
stage
already
accounted
for
typical
regional
geochemical variability in the trace elements, and as such, a single
dominant principal component captures the most important regional
geochemical anomalies (compare Figs. 12 and 13). Therefore, our
method is expected to be more objective and produce more consistent
and replicable prospectivity maps than the multivariate method, as
Fig. 15. Map of principal component 1 using the second-best combination of ML algorithms on raw data, following our procedure. Included in the regional pro-
spectivity map are the lithological boundaries (Fig. 2) and glacial dispersion trends (black arrows). Abbreviations: Strange Lake peralkaline intrusion (SL); Mistastin
Batholith (MB). The glacial dispersal trend from the REE-bearing Strange Lake intrusion is visible and extends approximately 100 km to the northeast. Furthermore,
another glacial dispersal trend is visible extending 140 km northeast from the southern portion of the Mistastin Batholith.

manual interpretation is not utilized in intermediary steps. When our
approach is used in the univariate application to generate elemental
anomaly maps, it is clear that our approach is superior to the multivariate
method, which requires a convoluted approach to ﬁrst identify key
stoichiometries in the area that vary, then regress a target element
against the main principal components to determine the regression re-
siduals, which are used to produce anomaly-type of prospectivity maps.
In addition, we show that we do not require log-ratio data trans-
formations and show that if data transformations such as log-ratio
transformations are to be applied to a workﬂow, then their effects
should be quantitatively measured against a baseline (e.g., using raw
data). Where it can be shown that they improve the predictive modelling
performance, then we anticipate that the application of those trans-
formations can similarly result in a higher contrast in resulting
geochemical anomaly maps. For these types of comparisons, performance
resulting from a workﬂow using raw data should be used as a baseline or
default, since any transformation must be demonstrably performance-
enhancing. In our approach, since we do not assume the existence of
stoichiometry in the data, nor do we require extensive manual inter-
pretation, our method is more data driven and more ﬂexible. However, as
our approach is data driven, the quality of baselines depends on the
quality of the data, in the same sense as for multivariate modelling, in
that the data needs to capture a substantial geochemical baseline. This is
not a drawback that is unique to our approach, but is general to all data-
driven approaches, since anomalies can only be contextualized against a
large backdrop of non-anomalous data. Lastly, our method is designed to
be able to accommodate a range of ML algorithms, such that we leave the
choice between complex and powerful, and simple and highly explain-
able algorithms to the user through an informed knowledge of their
performance differences.

6. Conclusion
The use of geochemical data continues to evolve and prospectivity
mapping has always greatly beneﬁtted by developments in data analysis,
modelling and mapping methods. With the proliferation of data-driven
methods such as ML, it is possible to simultaneously improve upon
existing approaches, while generating entirely new approaches. In this
study, we demonstrated a technique to leverage compositional data by
using ML methods to improve upon the existing multivariate approach
and as a substitute for it in some applications. In comparison with the
multivariate method, our technique does not assume stoichiometric
variability of elements, does not require geoscientiﬁc knowledge-based
process discovery and interpretation, does not require data imputation
and is ﬂexible with respect to the choice of algorithm to balance the need
for performance with the need for model explain-ability. Therefore, our
approach is more data-driven and the workﬂow itself is almost entirely
automatable, which requires little manual interaction. This facilitates the
adoption of our technique, especially where the amount of data or pro-
jects exceeds the amount of manual labour. For its application in lake
sediment geochemistry and for the exploration of REEs in the southeast
Churchill Province, our procedure is both more accurate and more se-
lective than the multivariate method, to within a comparable amount of
manual labour. We expect that our approach would generalize well to
other types of exploration geochemical data.

Fig. 18. Map of principal component 1 using the third-best combination of ML algorithms on CLR-transformed data, following our procedure. Included in the regional
prospectivity map are the lithological boundaries (Fig. 2) and glacial dispersion trends (black arrows). Abbreviations: Strange Lake peralkaline intrusion (SL); Mistastin
Batholith (MB). The glacial dispersal trend from the REE-bearing Strange Lake intrusion is visible and extends approximately 100 km to the northeast. Furthermore,
another glacial dispersal trend is visible extending 140 km northeast from the southern portion of the Mistastin Batholith.
