Abstract 
The centroid change equation, which is about six-track rescue robot with four swinging arms for mine emergency rescue, 
is solved by center of mass theory
the relationship between the centroid and angle of swing arms is derived. The graphs 
of the robot’s centroid and the chart of the angle of the swing arms are drawn by calculation and Adams simulation, the 
results are agreement with each other. The rationality of the formula inference and the correctness of secondary 
development of Adams are verified. Then the plot of centroid changes is drown when rescue robot acrosses three steps, 
which provides the theoretical basis for the future study for controlling of robot’s posture and the judgment of its stability 
when it crosses barriers.

1. Preface 
Virtual prototype simulation has been used in all walks of life, and Adams is the most widely used 
simulation software, namely Automatic Dynamic Analysis of Mechanical Systems. The system can simulate 
the motion of a mechanical structure and output the curves of the motion’s displacement, velocity, 
acceleration, torque and so on, but it cannot directly output the displacement curves of the center of mass for 
motion mechanism. Centroid change have a very important meaning in motion mechanism design and 
research. With the aid of the secondary development in Adams simulation software, the center of mass’s 
change curve of the motion mechanism is solved.

Six-track rescue robot with four swinging arm designed mainly for coal mine gas explosion accident 
rescue[1], is required superior climbing obstacle capability and fast, stable movement ability. The four-arms 
can move separately, and, through controlling the angle of the swing arm to make robot keep stationarity in 
various conditions. 
2. Modeling of rescue robot’s centroid change  
2.1. Theoretical calculation of solving centroid 
 
Fig. 1. robot’s centroid distribution 
As shown in Fig.1, the origin of the coordinate system is been established on the robot’s driving wheel axis, 
the axial center of the driven wheel is O6, and the axial center of the four-arm wheel are respectively O2,O3,O4 
and O5. Six-track rescue robot with four swinging arm can be divided into five particle, ie front left arm, front 
right arm, the main body, rear left swing arm, rear right swing arm, and five centroid is Gi, the quality of the i-
th dot is mi, the coordinates is (xi, yi), i = 1,2,3,4,5, and the coordinates of the centroid of the entire robot is G 
(x, y). The distance between O1 and O6,O1 and G1,O1 and O2,O1 and O3,O6 and G4,O6 and O5 is respectively

Because the angle 
1 of the vehicle body with X-axis direction are determined by the angle of the four 
swing arms, so the angle 
1 is jointly determined by the changes of

Because the four swing arm’s length and quality are equal, make the assumption that:L2=L3=L4=L5=L
m2=m3=m4=m5=m , then six tracked robot’s centroid formula is arranged as following:

2.2. Formula inference 
1) Under the assumption that the initial angles of the front and rear swing arms on the robot are equal and 
opposite, then the robot body remains parallel to the ground(

when the four swing 
arms swing upward or downward at the same time, the angle of the robot body will not be changed. Under the 
condition that the four swing arms swing upward or downward at the same time, the relationship between

 will satisfy the equation as follows,

                                                    (3) 
It is obvious that the centroid change of robot is a straight line which is parallel to the Y axis and through 
the certain point (

0), the change of value in the Y direction coordinate is a 
sinusoidal relationship with

.On the condition that

centroid in the Y direction will be acquired.  
2) Assuming that the four swing arms of the robot with three ground-contacting stationary, while the left 
one is dangling and can swing freely. With out touching the ground, the equation can be a function about an 
independent variable 
r i , and 
r i is a fixed value, the equation is as follows shown: [2]

It can be seen from the formula that the coordinate value in the X direction of the robot’s centroid is a 
cosine relationship about the swing arm angle 
i , while the value in the Y direction is a sinusoid relationship 
about the swing arm angle
i . The centroid curve of XG and YG is a circular arc based on (a, b)as the center, c 
is the radius of the arc.

3. Simulate and analyze of the centroid changes 
3.1. Adams secondary development  
Adams has a strong secondary development function. There are two main forms of cycle command: 
for/End and while/End. For/End command is mainly adopted in this article. Adams conditional loop 
commands are adopted to redact codes and establish .CMD file through a text editor. The file will be done 
according to the program flow diagram (Fig.2), and then open the motion mechanism which requires solving 
the centroid from the Adams simulation software. At last, carrying out the kinematic simulation of virtual 
prototype, the centroid displacement curve can be plotted in the Adams /Postprocessor. 
 
Fig.2. program flow chart  
3.2. Matlab simulation calculation and ADAMS virtual simulation  
In the Matlab simulation calculation, each parameter of the rescue robot will be brought into the formula (3) 
and (4). The robot main body mass is m1=80.12Kg, swing arm mass is 1.97Kg, L=498mm
L’=177mm. The 
curve is draw by using Matlab, and it is shown in (a) and (c) of Fig.3. The dynamics model is established for 
the six-track rescue robot with four swinging arms according to the requirements of simulation in Adams, 
then the appropriate software environment and parameters are been set , posture of robot is been adjusted.  
The graphs, showing the relationship between the centroid change of rescue robot and the change of swing 
arm angle of the four swing arms, are been drawn through Adams/Solve. The simulation results are been 
shown in the (b) and (d) of Fig.3. 
Various parameters of the robot are used in the Matlab simulation calculation, the curve of the centroid 
change compared to that gotten through the use of Adams simulation software, which establish a three-
dimensional simulation model. The analysis results are shown in Fig.3. In the two special circumstances of 
hypothesis, the simulation experiment is consistent with theoretical calculations, so it is verify the rationality 
of centroid curve formula and the correctness of Adams secondary development, which measure the centroid

position of a motion mechanism. The numerical errors are caused by the inaccurate value of mass and the 
coordinate of centroid in theoretical analysis, while the each parameter of robot can be calculated exactly in 
the process of Adams simulation, and the precision is higher.

Fig.4. The graph of centroid when the robot climbs three-step 
Six-track rescue robot with four swinging arms is designed for the environment which is more complex 
and uncertain. In order to adjust the rescue plan timely, the people who control the robot can track the robot 
and learn about working condition through the centroid curve of the robot. To take robot climb stairs as an 
example, it can be seen that the centroid changes over time about points of A
B
C
D
E
F in Fig.4. At 
the very beginning, the four swing arms of robot are parallel to the ground, A, B are the point that the front 
swing arms contact with the first and second steps. C is the contact point between the driving wheel and the 
first step, D is the contact point of the front arm and the third step, E is the contact point of the driving wheel 
426  
 Hongwei Ma et al. /  AASRI Procedia  3 ( 2012 )  421 – 426 
and the second step, EF is the phase of rear swing arms adjusting the posture to support the robot up, FG is the 
phase of driven wheel climbing the second step, GH is the phase of driven wheel climbing the second step, 
after the H-point, the phase is the process of robot climbing the third step and downing stairs successfully. 
4. Conclusion 
In this paper, the centroid change of six-track rescue robot with four swinging arms has been analyzed by 
means of center of mass theory. The relationship between centroid curve and the angle of swing arm are been 
reasoned analysed. And then, the relationship is verified by the simulation software. At last, the main 
conclusions are as follows:  
1) The four swing arms have the same initial angle, and when they swing at the same time and the same 
direction, the coordinate value in the Y direction of the robot’s centroid is a sinusoid relationship about 
the swing arm angle, while the value in the X direction of the robot’s centroid is irrelevant to the swing 
angle. 
2) The three of four swing arms are fixed to the ground, and the other one is dangling and can freely swing 
but it don’t contact the ground, the centroid YG can get the relationship of sinusoid function with the 
swing angle, and the centroid XG can get the relationship of cosine function with the swing angle. 
Meanwhile the centroid XG and YG are the arc curves. 
3) Via secondary development, the problem that the centroid change for motion mechanism can’t be drawn 
is successfully be solved. This method can not only settle the problem on centroid change of the moving 
robot based on Adams simulation, but also can be applied to other researches on kinematics simulation 
with complex structure.
