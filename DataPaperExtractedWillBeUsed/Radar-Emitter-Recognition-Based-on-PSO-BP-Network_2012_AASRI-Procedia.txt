Abstract 
According to the problem of emitter characteristic parameters are showed by interval and uneasy to identify, an emitter 
fusion recognition method based on the PSO-BP neural network is proposed. The method train the network by training 
samples which are reasonable structured according to the distribution in the interval, so as to determine the network 
structure and confirm the emitter type through the emitter characteristics parameters. At the same time, the BP neural 
network is optimized by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. The coding method of the network output, 
training data size and deviation rate on the influence of the recognition are researched by simulation, and the validity of 
this method are verified by the results.

1. Introduction 
In the modern electronic reconnaissance, the battlefield environment is complicated. The hostility will take 
all kinds of measures against in the fight. So radar emitter characteristic parameters have some random and 
fuzzy because of all kinds of the existence of the interference and reconnaissance and the error of 
measurement of equipment itself. How to recognize the radar emitter in a complicated electromagnetic 
environment of reconnaissance has very important military significance [1]. There are a lot of existing classic

methods, including method based on the bayesian theory, method based on the fuzzy pattern recognition, 
method based on the rough set theory [2], method based on evidence theory, method based on artificial neural 
network, and so on. These methods have relatively successful applications in recognition of radiation sources. 
But these methods are generally aim at the measured parameters showed by the scalar form, and solve the 
problem of radar emitter recognition whose parameters are measured with some error. For another case of the 
measured parameters are interval type is less discussion. 
This article mainly aims at the radar parameters of template library for the interval representation and 
measured values for the scalar form, focus on recognition problem that characteristic parameters are interval 
type using BP neural network. But the BP neural network easy to get local optimal, and the convergence 
speed slower in late training, so using the PSO algorithm to optimize the BP neural network to find the 
optimal weights and thresholds of the network before training in the paper, thus speeding up the convergence 
speed of training and effectively avoiding algorithm into local optimal at the same time.

2.2.  BP neural network 
The three layers of the BP neural network are used in this article. The input layer node number as same of 
the number of radar characteristic parameters, the output layer nodes number is the number of radar type plus

However, the BP neural network is easy to fall into local optimum in the training process. In order to 
overcome the deficiencies of the BP neural network, the PSO algorithm are used to obtain the optimal initial 
value of the network weights and thresholds. Using the PSO algorithm to train the BP network, the particles in 
the PSO algorithm need to be encoded. The dimension of each particle is equal to all the BP neural network 
connection weights number and thresholds number. The dimension number is

3. Fusion recognition model 
This article focuses on the type of radar emitter recognition problem. So-called radiation source recognition 
is the process of matching emitter characteristic parameters detected and in the radar template library so as to 
216  
 Yu Zhi-fu et al. /  AASRI Procedia  1 ( 2012 )  213 – 219 
obtain the radiation source type [4]. From the point of view of neural network classification, its purpose is to 
confirm the nonlinear mapping of parameter feature space and radiation source models space. The 
characteristic parameters mainly are carrier frequency RF (radio frequency), pulse width of the PW (The pulse 
width), pulse repetition interval PRI (The pulse the repeat interval), the modulation of the MOP (pulse 
modulation on the in radar pulse) [5], and so on.

4. Simulation and analysis 
In order to verify this algorithm performance, the emitter recognition simulation was carried out. Proposed 
there are 3 species of radar in the template radar library, the characteristic parameters of the radar as RF, PRI 
and PW. According to the literature [1], the specific parameters are shown in Table 1.

Simulation A: 1500 emitter samples to be identified are structured based on data in Table 1, corresponding 
to 500 samples per radar, and randomly selected half of them as training samples, the other half as test 
samples. Assuming the emitter characteristic parameter values uniformly distributed in the range, then to 
identify emitter samples are uniform random sampling in the known characteristic parameter value range of 
template radar. Training samples are normalized and used as the input of BP neural network and PSO-BP 
neural network. The input nodes of neural network are as same as the number of radar types, and the output 
node number is 1. The corresponding relations are shown in the Table 3 of PSO-BP1. The number of hidden 
nodes identified as 3 according to the empirical formula (3). Parameter settings in the PSO algorithm are 
shown in Table 2.

In order to study the optimization effect of PSO algorithm to BP neural network, drawing training error 
convergence curve of BP neural network and PSO-BP neural network in the condition of the same target error 
and no limiting the number of iterations in Fig.2(a). The results show that the BP neural network is easy to fall 
into local minima in the latter period of training, while the PSO-BP neural network can achieve the accuracy 
requirements with seldom number of iterations, and its convergence velocity is faster than PSO-BP neural 
network. Drawing training error convergence curve of both two methods in the condition of the same number 
of iterations as 20 times but no limiting target error in Fig. 3, the results show that the PSO-BP neural network 
can achieve higher accuracy in the same number of iterations. Fig.2(a) and Fig.2(b) show that the PSO 
algorithm can effectively overcome the deficiencies of the BP neural network. Curves are the experimental 
results of 20 times of Monte-Carlo. During the experiment in Fig.2(a).

Simulation B: In order to study the deviation rate influence on recognition rate, while maintaining the data 
in Table 1 median value unchanged, assume all kinds of radar deviation rate are the same. When the emitter 
characteristic parameters obey uniform distribution in the interval, then according to the mean value and 
deviation rate can determine characteristic parameters range and construct the training samples. The number 
of samples is as same as simulation A. The curve of recognition rate in the different deviation rate is shown in 
Fig.4(a). Label PSO-BP1, PSO-BP2 and PSO-BP4 on behalf respectively of the output node number of 1, 2 
and 4. The figure aims to study the different coding method influence on recognition rate. The corresponding 
relationship is shown in Table 3, and the symbol O in the table on behalf of the output layer nodes.

According to the Fig.4(a), it is obvious that the smaller of deviation rate of characteristic parameters the 
higher recognition rate, which is consistent with theoretical analysis results. In addition, the recognition rate 
of different curves in Fig.4(a) is different, which indicates that the number of different encoding methods and 
network output nodes have influence on recognition rate. The more number encoded bits, the higher 
recognition rate. But the increasing of encoded bits will enlarge the complexity of the network, and eventually 
result in increasing running time.  
 
Simulation C: In addition to the number of the training samples, the rest of the simulation conditions are the 
same with simulation B of PSO-BP2 method. Fusion recognition results under different population sizes and 
different method are shown in Fig.4(b) and the curves in the figure are the result of the 20 Monte-Carlo 
experiments. The graph annotation of PSO-BP2-500 represents second kinds of coding method and each kind 
of radar is constructed of 500 samples. The rest of the annotation can reason by analogy. PSO-BP2-500 of 
Fig.4(b) is corresponding to PSO-BP2 of Fig.4(a). The simulation results show that the increase of training 
data size can improve the recognition rate. But the more number of training samples, the longer time of 
training network. Different training times of neural network corresponding to different sample number are 
shown in the Table 4.

5. Conclusion 
A kind of emitter recognition method based on PSO-BP neural network is proposed. The biggest difference 
related to the method of fixed value of characteristic parameters is the construction of sample data. The 
deviation rate is defined in the model to reflect the degree of the value of the characteristic parameters deviate 
from its center, and then the deviation rate influence on recognition rate is studied in the simulation. PSO 
algorithm is applied to improve the BP neural network. The simulation results show that the PSO algorithm 
can effectively overcome the defects of the BP neural network. Simulation experiments also studied the 
influence of the neural network output coding and sample data size to recognition rate. The final results show 
that the proposed target recognition method is effective and it has some value in engineering. The main 
problem of model is no considering the characteristic parameters with discrete value in the selection of emitter 
parameters, such as modulation information MOP. The next research focus is to construct model of more 
general while without losing practicality.
