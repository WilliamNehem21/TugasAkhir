Abstract
In robotics, pose errors are known as positional and rotational errors of a given mechanical system. Those errors are
commonly produced by the play among joined components, commonly known as joint clearances. Predicting pose errors 
can be done via the formulation of two optimization models holding continuous domains, which belong to the NP-Hard 
class of problems. This paper focuses on providing rigorous and reliable solution to this problem by using constraint 
programing.

1. Introduction
Accuracy is one of the key features that favor robotic manipulators for many industrial applications.
Superior levels of accuracy are achieved by controlling or measuring all possible sources of errors on the pose
of the moving platform of a robotic manipulator. Joint clearance is one of most important sources of errors. It

introduces extraneous degrees of freedom between two connected links. When present, they generally
contribute importantly to the degradation of the performance of a mechanism. Various approaches have been 
proposed to compute and quantify the errors due to joint clearances [8, 9, 10, 12, 13], however none of them 
focuses on the reliability of solutions, which is mandatory to provide an accurate prediction of the pose error.
This paper focuses on guaranteeing the reliability of solutions by using constraint programming and interval
analysis. To this end, we combine a branch and bound algorithm with interval analysis, which allow drawing
firm bounds on the pose errors given possible ranges for the clearances. We illustrate experimental results
where the proposed approach generally outperforms the well-known solvers GAMS/BARON [1] and ECLiPSe
[5], while providing reliable solutions.
2. The problem formulation
In order to generalize the application of our approach, in this paper we consider robotic mechanical
systems with one end-effector, n revolute joints, and n links. Then, we assume that the manipulator is
composed of n joints and n + 1 links. 
Figure 1. A manipulator composed of two joints, two links and an end-effector (left side) and a revolute joint affected by clearance (right
side).
Figure 1 depicts an instance of such system considering n=2 involving joints with join clearance as
illustrated on the right side of Figure 1. Our goal is to find the maximum pose error for a given robotic
configuration. Let 
represents the rotational error and
the translational error. Then, the maximum
pose error can be obtained by solving the following two optimization problems:

where

 corresponds to 
the translation in joint a with respect to axis b. 
 and  are simply constants used to limit the pose errors 
depending on the given configuration (an extended explanation of this model can be found in [4]). Let us 
notice that both problems belong to the category of NP-Hard problems [7]. 
3. Experimental evaluation 
The problem has been solved by using a branch and bound algorithm that performs the arithmetic 
operations with interval analysis [2, 11]. This algorithm has been implemented on top of the RealPaver solver 
[6]. The implementation details can be seen in [3]. A set of experiments have been carried out so as to verify 
the reliability of solutions and to compare the performance of such implementation with GAMS/BARON [1] 
and ECLiPSe [5] solvers. The following experiments take into account 4 models (see Table 1). The illustrated 
running times correspond to the best ones of 10 runs.  
The results show that our implementation is in general faster than its competitors. For smaller problems 
involving two and three joints, our algorithm exhibits excellent performance, being dramatically faster that 
BARON. This is because there is no need for a high level of precision for this problem. Indeed, there is no 
need to reach the usual 10-8 precision, which makes the search process less costly than they usually are.

Let us note that running times is not the most important aspect to remark. It is more important to observe 
that the solutions reached by the BARON solver are not always reliable. Indeed we have verified by using 
RealPaver that results computed by BARON are unfeasible on some of the above tested problem instances. 
The following example illustrates how BARON can fail to give the correct value and return an inconsistent 
point instead. Let 
 be two real variables, 
, and two constraints 
 and 
. When BARON tries to find the lowest  for which both constraints are 
satisfied, it returns the point 
 although it is inconsistent w.r.t. the constraints of the problem. Finally, let 
us focus on the results obtained for the manipulator composed of two revolute joints illustrated in Fig. 1. Let 
us assume its geometric parameters are defined as follows: 
 
, 
,
,
, 
,
 .  
The joint clearances are equal to:

Figure 2. BARON fails to find the global minimum and returns an inconsistent point instead.
RealPaver and BARON were used to solve the optimization problem for all manipulator poses. Table 2
depicts the value of the maximum positioning error of the end-effector, obtained with RealPaver and
BARON, respectively. This value is expressed in millimeters and plotted throughout the manipulator 
workspace. We can notice that the maximum obtained with BARON is always higher than the one obtained
with RealPaver. The difference in any point between the results given by the two solvers is around one
millimeter and decreases when positioning error rises: As we already mentioned it, we could notice that the
solutions obtained with BARON may not be feasible.

4. Conclusion and Future Work
In this paper, we have modeled and solved the complex problem of predicting the maximum position and 
rotational error in robotic manipulators. To this end we have employed constraint programming techniques

and interval analysis. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach where it is able to in 
general outperform well-known solvers such as BARON and ECLiPSe, providing reliable solutions. In this 
context, there are several directions for future work such as to implement more efficient filtering techniques 
for accelerating the convergence of solutions. In this way, it would be easier to handle the exponential growth 
of the space of solutions. Finally, it would be interesting to pay an extended attention to the unreliability of 
solutions obtained by BARON. Such a problem could be also present in additional solvers.
