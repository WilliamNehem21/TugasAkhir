Nowadays there is a tremendous effort to enhance educational procedure with the incorporation of new
technologies aiming at the better understanding of educational material from students. In this direction
many theories have been developed, some of which have been implemented into digital systems. A chal-
lenge here is to develop a system that integrates more than one of such theories in a harmonic way for the
beneﬁt of student community. In this work we attempt to give an answer to this challenge proposing a
novel system that integrates the main characteristics of three well-known educational theories: learning
objects, collaborative learning and mobile learning in the context of cultural heritage teaching and learn-
ing. Evaluation results suggest that such an attempt is technically feasible, the integrated characteristics
of the educational theories remain visible to educators of cultural heritage courses, while cultural her-
itage educators positively accept the potential incorporation of the platform in the educational
procedure.

1. Introduction
Education is a ﬁeld where Information Technology (IT) has
made signiﬁcant impact in the last 20 years [1,5,10–12,18,20].
School curricula all over the world include IT courses that intro-
duce modern technology to students helping them to develop
new skills, necessary for their later life. In addition, teachers and
professors of traditional courses like history, mathematics or geog-
raphy try to use computers, mobile devices and educational soft-
ware
to
connect
with
their
students
more
efﬁciently
and
profoundly and enhance the quality of educational procedure
[6,20,21,25–27]. Cultural heritage related courses could not ignore
this new reality. Computers and educational software invaded
teaching and learning of cultural heritage related courses adding
value to cultural heritage pedagogy, education and learning [33].
Such courses bare their own unique combination of characteristics
like the capability to be conducted outside the classroom on a cul-
tural heritage site or monument and the high level of interactivity
among the teacher and her/his students [7]. As authors in [33] indi-
cate ‘‘The possibility of examining the context and the landscape
where a Cultural Heritage artifact was/is located has important
consequences on the study of the artifact itself and on its analysis
and evaluation”. Moreover, cultural heritage courses attempt to
disseminate large amounts of knowledge. Thus, teachers of such
courses tend to ask from their students to form collaborative teams
and explore cultural heritage content together in order to come in
contact with as much knowledge as possible through their own
studying or the discoveries of their classmates [7]. Furthermore,
cultural heritage courses share common knowledge regardless of
the time and place of the educational process. Cultural heritage
content has a universal scope and can be used by teachers and stu-
dents all over the world [33].
The integration of the above characteristics to a uniﬁed educa-
tional digital environment for cultural heritage courses would not
have a solid background without the guidance of approved educa-
tional theories. Collaborative learning theory promotes student
collaboration and active participation, mobile learning theory
explains how to effectively use mobile technology for teaching
and learning inside and outside the classroom and learning objects
theory guides the creation of re-usable, aggregation-ready, inde-
pendent and meta-data enrichable educational content. More
speciﬁcally, collaborative learning theory [5] guides the formation
of small teams in which students work together to reach a com-
mon educational goal. Every student participates actively and
she/he is responsible to fulﬁl her/his assigned task in order to help
the team. Mobile learning [12,24] provides unique characteristics

like portability, user mobility, pervasiveness, ubiquity and imme-
diate interaction with the external environment making learning
experience more engaging and interesting for young students.
Learning objects theory [10] uses small, independent, reusable,
aggregation-ready educational units as the main element of educa-
tional procedure. Such units can be designed and implemented
easily with the help of digital means and can become available to
students during learning process regardless of the digital environ-
ment or tools they use. Those educational theories can be easily
implemented in IT applications, since they have guided the imple-
mentation
of
numerous
educational
software
applications
[1,6,7,23,31,32].
In this context some fundamental questions arise. Could a dig-
ital educational environment for cultural heritage efﬁciently inte-
grate the main characteristics of learning objects, collaborative
and mobile learning theories into a feasible uniﬁed framework in
technical terms? How can the basic characteristics of those educa-
tional theories remain visible to educators and students when they
are incorporated in a single educational platform? Will cultural
heritage management educators accept such an environment?
The above IT-ready educational theories have guided the design
and implementation of an educational platform for cultural her-
itage courses. The platform provides a fully personalized learning
environment, implements various services that promote collabora-
tion among students and uses mobile applications to disengage the
educational process from the classroom transferring it to the ﬁeld
and thus providing an immersive and pervasive learning experi-
ence. Moreover, the system organizes information in learning
objects that can be used independently or in collections and it also
gives users the opportunity to provide personalized tagging and
metadata to each learning object. The platform supports a user-
friendly and interactive environment that collects and presents
cultural heritage information spanning in various cultural disci-
plines. Registered users are able to contribute primitive or existing
cultural content and create their personal learning units, working
alone or in teams. Teachers can monitor student interaction with
the system in real-time guiding students to construct collective
knowledge through collaboration and co-dependent tasking and
checking students’ contributions for validity and soundness. In
order to measure the acceptability of the proposed platform, we
performed a qualitative evaluation with the help of undergraduate
university students who have the potential to become educators of
cultural heritage courses in the near future at primary or secondary
schools. Evaluation results suggest that the integration of the main
characteristics of certain educational theories has been success-
fully performed.
2. State of the art
The integration and adaptation of characteristics from collabo-
rative learning theory or mobile learning theory or learning objects
theory to the implementation of educational software applications
have been proven feasible in numerous cases [1,6,11,16,19,23].
Wang [1] introduces the design of a collaborative learning environ-
ment that focuses on making collaboration friendlier among stu-
dents. Chen and Choi [6] present the design of an online
collaborative location-aware platform for history learning. Dorca
et al. [23] present an efﬁcient approach for personalization of the
teaching process using learning objects. A thorough discussion
about various technical aspects of mobile learning including
usability, user experience and accessibility is provided in [11].
Various platforms have been introduced in the ﬁeld of cultural
heritage education [2,3,17,22]. WebQuests [2] is an educational
environment that promotes inquiry-oriented educational activities
based on online resources providing numerous cultural heritage
lessons. MedcGame [3] is a collaborative cultural heritage interac-
tive software that attempts to engage students in an active learn-
ing process. The MusEd Platform [17] offers an online learning
repository of reusable cultural heritage content, organized in learn-
ing objects. Castle Route [22] urges students to reﬂect, investigate,
disseminate and share cultural heritage and historical content cre-
ating a collaborative environment.
Some platforms achieved in implementing characteristics from
two of the above theories [7,31,32]. The aCME system is a general-
purpose mobile infrastructure that aims at enhancing mobile
seamless learning and promotes collaboration among teachers
and students [32]. Students and teachers engage in online discus-
sions included in predeﬁned courses. The system is platform-
independent as it can be accessed through any device and from
any location and tailorable as it supports the integration of new
functionalities in order to meet personalized user needs. While
aCME is tailor-made for usage inside an educational environment,
the proposed platform is a participatory cultural environment
which can be used as an educational tool for seamless learning
offering more features comparing to aCME. aCME uses conversa-
tion as a basic educational tool. Teachers initiate discussions offer-
ing
related
information
and
students
participate
in
the
conversation through their mobile devices. In the proposed plat-
form a teacher can invite her/his students to participate in a course
providing their own material. This material can be captured from
the students through the Collector application. The teacher can
author the student-contributed material proposing the necessary
modiﬁcations and checking students throughout the procedure.
In the proposed platform all the contributed material can be visu-
alized through an interactive cultural map service. Students can
incorporate material contributed by other users (colleagues or
not) in their coursework. A discussion forum feature is also pro-
vided as a complementary tool for the conduct of conversations
among teachers and students.
The COLLAGE platform [31] implements the characteristics of
various IT-ready educational theories like mobile learning, game-
based learning and collaborative learning. The COLLAGE platform
and the proposed platform resemble in various features. Both sys-
tems allow students to create their own content and share, reuse,
evaluate and comment educational material. Both systems offer
rich multimedia content and support mobile educational activities
outside the classroom. Students in both platforms can collaborate
in a project. Both platforms are intended for use by both students
and teachers. However the two platforms have some fundamental
differences. The presented platform promotes learning through the
management of cultural heritage content, while COLLAGE uses
educational interactive games. The proposed platform organizes
content following the principles and standards of Learning Objects
theory. Even though COLLAGE supports content reuse and meta-
data enrichment, it does not obviously follow a speciﬁc established
Learning Objects standard. The presented platform’s design was
guided by the acceptable IEEE 1484.12.1-2002 standard for Learn-
ing Object Metadata version 1.3 (LOM Standard) [28]. Furthermore,
the COLLAGE platform supports mainly mobile users and outdoor
learning. On the other hand, the presented platform works equally
well for indoor and outdoor classroom activities. The proposed
platform allows public content contribution, while in the COLLAGE
platform contributions are made by students and teachers. Lastly,
the COLLAGE platform is intended for use by secondary school
students and teachers, while our platform targets students of all
grades
from
elementary
school
to
academic
students
and
professors.
The LAMP/Pulu platform [7] is a mobile digital guiding and
learning platform that implements characteristics from mobile
learning and collaborative learning. LAMP/Pulu urges students to
engage in the learning procedure by exploring a cultural heritage
20

site in real-time using mobile devices. The platform allows stu-
dents and teachers to contribute personal content based on their
experiences or take part in educational discussions. In LAMP/Pulu
platform, students learn and construct personal experiences
through group work, collaboration and interaction in small groups.
The LAMP/Pulu platform makes a primitive step towards the orga-
nization of educational information in units. Those units are re-
usable within the context of the project, but they are neither plat-
form independent as they can be only used within the LAMP plat-
form, nor aggregation-ready or metadata enrichable as a typical
learning object should be.
Many researchers attempted to measure or evaluate the accep-
tance of educational systems [15,18,20]. Gan et al. [15] examine
the positive effect of interactive digital media on collaborative
learning in higher education for both instructors and students.
Domingo and Gargante [20] investigate the impact of using mobile
learning applications in primary education from teachers’ percep-
tion. Sung et al. found that the application of mobile devices to
education has a moderate mean effect size extracting beneﬁts
and drawbacks of mobile learning [18].
3. Proposed educational platform
The proposed system is an educational participatory digital
platform for gathering and disseminating cultural heritage content,
which can be used during the educational procedure. The platform
has been designed to integrate the main characteristics of three
different
educational theories:
learning
objects,
collaborative
learning and mobile learning, while also offering features found
in other educational theories like constructivism and multimedia
learning.
3.1. Educational content
Guided by learning objects theory, the system has been
designed to organize educational content in units. Each unit retains
the main characteristics of a learning object as they have been
declared by learning objects theory [10]. More speciﬁcally, each
unit contains a small amount of information and it can be used
by one or more individuals simultaneously. Each unit is semanti-
cally independent from other ones and it can be used on its own
or be aggregated in a collection with other units, which share a
common semantical feature. A unit can be reused as many times
as desired without losing its value and it can be enriched by addi-
tional information in a personalized manner.
In order to achieve those design goals we relied on the widely
acceptable LOM Standard [28]. In this speciﬁcation, educational
metadata are divided into nine top level categories: general, life
cycle, meta-metadata, technical, educational, rights, relation, anno-
tation, and classiﬁcation. Each one of those categories is reﬁned in
various ﬁelds giving semantics to each learning object. We imple-
mented the above speciﬁcations by adding the appropriate ﬁelds to
the database table that stores system educational content. Each
unit appears as a table record with a signiﬁcant number of ﬁelds
reﬂecting the various top level categories of the standard. Meta-
data information appears in the xml ﬁle which is exported by the
database table and contains system’s educational content. The
xml ﬁle can be reused in other educational platforms. Moreover,
since xml is a platform-independent scripting language, system’s
educational content can be exploited by various applications
achieving a high level of interoperability like IMS Editor Vimse
[29] and LOM-Editor [30].
Learning objects are aggregated in collections based on general
and educational elements as they are described in their metadata.
More speciﬁcally, educational units can be aggregated in collec-
tions per cultural discipline, keyword, interactivity type and level,
context, age range, difﬁculty, learning time and semantic density. If
a teacher wants to create a speciﬁc collection, she/he can download
the corresponding xml ﬁle with ﬁltered content based on her/his
needs.
All content is provided by platform users, which retain owner-
ship over their contributions and they are allowed to manage their
own content (edit or delete it). Users can contribute content
through a user-friendly screen (Fig. 1) or via platform’s dedicated
mobile application (Fig. 2) in a single unit each time. Each unit con-
sists of information in the form of text, audio, images, video and
multimedia like notes, descriptions, historical background infor-
mation, theatrical plays and scripts, literary works or reviews
and references, drawings, pictures, notes, sketches, animations,
narrations, storytelling, interviews and vocal guides. Multimedia
ﬁles can be a full demo package with all kinds of data types. Espe-
cially multimedia content has been proven that improves student
understanding [13]. The teacher is responsible to insert additional
information required by the LOM Standard, when she/he authors
contributed content by her/his students.

Students are able to interact with the system searching and
viewing educational content as many times as they desire concur-
rently with other students. Also students can review a unit. Stu-
dent contributions lead in constructing new personal knowledge
and sharing it with other students, which is a key feature in educa-
tional theories like constructivism [9].
3.2. Educational services
The features of mobile and collaborative learning theories
guided the design and implementation of platform’s educational
services. The presented platform classiﬁes the offered educational
services in three categories: generic, student collaborative learning
and mobile learning services. More speciﬁcally:
3.2.1. Generic services
� Search
educational
content:
The platform offers several
user-friendly and interactive ways to search content like search
bars and interactive options on geographical maps that are located
in various sections around the platform (Fig. 3). Users can search
for educational content by providing the appropriate search terms
in the form of keywords or phrases in the search bars or by
selecting the available ﬁltering options on the geographical map.
� View educational content: In order to be as user-friendly, easy-
to-use, attractive and interactive as possible the platform pro-
vides two different ways to present educational units. The ﬁrst
way is an interactive geographical map where all educational
units appear in the form of pins (Fig. 4). When a user desires to
view the information a pin hosts, she/he can click on the pin to
read item’s title and a brief description or she/he can navigate
to the item’s dedicated web page for more information and mul-
timedia content. The second way is the presentation of educa-
tional units in lists per cultural discipline (Fig. 5). Each unit is
represented as a list item that redirects user to a dedicated web
page.
� Content contribution: The platform allows registered users to
easily upload primitive or existing educational content. Both
students and teachers can contribute content related to a speci-
ﬁc course or general educational cultural content.
� Content authoring: Teachers can ask from platform modera-
tors to allow them to check their students’ contributions before
they are published to the broad public. If a permission is
granted, teachers check student contributions and inform them
whether something needs change. During this procedure teach-
ers enrich content with the appropriate metadata information
required by the LOM Standard.

3.2.2. Student collaborative learning services
� Student group formation: A teacher can request from platform
moderators the creation of a private user group in which she/he
will be the leader. Group members can share private educa-
tional content that is only visible within the group.
� Collaborative projects: Teachers can create a speciﬁc educa-
tional project, set a ﬁnal goal and intermediate tasks, provide
hints and solutions for each task and assign the project to a
speciﬁc student group. Students collaborate with their team-
mates to complete project tasks. After completing each task,
the system unlocks the next task until the ﬁnal goal is reached.
The system organizes potential projects in four distinct cate-
gories following an extended Contextual Model of Learning
(CML) [34]. Teachers can create projects and tasks of personal,
physical and socio-cultural context as dictated by the CML but
also, other projects and tasks based on teacher’s personal expe-
rience. Projects and tasks of personal context are designed to
adapt on the students’ interests, motivations, preferences, prior
knowledge and experience. Teachers can ﬁnd in the platform
ready-to-use examples of personal context projects and tasks.
Moreover, the system provides guidelines and links to help
teachers create such projects on-the-ﬂy. Projects and tasks of
physical context are designed to help students link educational
concepts with objects and experiences from the real world. Pro-
jects and tasks of socio-cultural context are designed to help
students create knowledge by adjusting an educational concept
to the external social and cultural environment with which the

23
concept interacts. Teachers can allow the system to present
their own projects and tasks to other teachers for usage. Project
and task creation is supported through user-friendly screens.
Teachers can use the pre-made project samples provided by
the platform, which have been created by other teachers.
� Content commenting: Students and teachers collaborate to
check educational units contributed by users. All users are
allowed to comment on an educational unit in the form of a
public review.
3.2.3. Mobile learning services
Along with the main modules of the platform, we have imple-
mented two dedicated mobile applications that offer different
learning services. Collector is a dedicated mobile application that
users can utilize to capture an image, audio or video ﬁle, add a per-
sonal annotation and send it to the system. Guide is a dedicated
mobile application that presents information concerning education
units in real-time on-demand and offers guiding services. The only
requirement to use Collector and Guide is to download, install and
enable it in each user’s android device.
� Mobile lesson service: Teachers can transfer the lesson outside
classroom with the use of Guide. If a teacher wants to revitalize
a lesson, then she/he can guide students outside and present
through Guide various cultural points of interest. The teacher
can start conversations with the students and urge them to
make reviews or start searching more information about any
cultural point.
� Real-time contributions service: Students and teachers can
create personal educational content by capturing audiovisual
content in real-time and storing it directly to the platform
through Collector.
3.3. System users and permitted operations
The proposed platform adapts an extended role based access
control model for authorization purposes concerning content
access. The implemented access control model supports three user
types/roles with different scopes and permission levels. Users are
separated in registered users that have created an account and
they are able to use the full potential of the platform and non-
registered users that do not have an active account on the system
and they can use only a part of the offered educational services.
� Teachers: Registered users that can search public content, view
both public and private content, create and assign tasks and
projects. Teachers can formulate private groups and include
students in them. Also teachers check content contributed by
students and make their own contributions.
� Students: Registered users that can search public content, view
both public and private content and contribute content. Stu-
dents can participate in private groups, comment on public con-
tributions and share public content on their social media.
� Guests: Nomadic users who view and search public content.
Depending on their role, users have various capabilities and
they can perform operations like adding, deleting, editing, search-
ing, viewing, commenting content and managing projects and
tasks.
� Add: Registered users can contribute educational units over
which they have complete ownership and responsibility.
� Edit/Delete: Registered users can modify or delete their own
units.
� Search: There are multiple searching levels for all users: (i) Sim-
ple searching: Users can search for educational content provid-
ing keywords corresponding to thematic attributes (like title,
description or discipline). (ii) Map searching: A user searches
educational content interacting with pins on a geographical
map. (iii) Location-based searching: Guide detects user’s geo-
graphical position and proposes nearby cultural points in a user
speciﬁed range.
� View: There are multiple viewing levels for all users: (i) Cultural
map viewing: A user views cultural content as pins on a geo-
graphical map. (ii) List viewing: A user views cultural content
in a list of descriptive thumbnails. (iii) Private content viewing:
Users that are members of a private group can view private
content.
� Comment: Registered users can make comments about any
public contribution.
� Create/Modify/Delete Project: Teachers can create a new pro-
ject and modify or delete an existing one, if they have created
it. They, also, assign students on the project explicitly.
� Create/Assign/Check Task: Teachers create intermediate tasks
on speciﬁc projects and provide hints and solutions. A task
can be assigned to one or more students. Student answers to
each task are checked by the teacher.
� Answer Task: Students provide answers to their assigned tasks.
4. Evaluation
In order to evaluate the educational strength of the proposed
platform we performed an evaluation with the use of appropriately
designed questionnaires. We attempted to measure how users
responded to speciﬁc services and whether the main requirements
of the utilized educational theories have been successfully met.
4.1. Research methodology
For the assessment process we designed a questionnaire and
distributed it to undergraduate students of the Department of cul-
tural heritage management and new technologies of the University
of Patras. 12 students where used in the experiment, 5 men and 7
women between the ages of 20 and 25. Our methodology guided us
to ﬁrst give a thorough explanation of system scope, features and
services and afterwards we urged students to use the system
through a speciﬁc educational usage scenario. More speciﬁcally,
we classiﬁed students in 6 teams consisting of two users and asked
them to collaborate within their team in order to search and con-
tribute information about Greek poets to the platform. Each stu-
dent
was
obligated
to
contribute
content
through
her/his
personal account on the platform in order to actively participate
in the procedure. Every contribution concerned speciﬁc informa-
tion about the life and work of a certain Greek poet. When all
teams fulﬁlled their task, they collaborated to create a collection
of information about the history of poetry in Greece. Each student
had the opportunity to make a comment on a colleague’s contribu-
tion. The procedure was monitored by course’s professor, who
started a conversation about Greek poetry using information from
student contributions. The conversation was recorded through Col-
lector and uploaded to the platform as a part of the collection. In
the end, users were asked to repeat the same procedure using
Europeana [8], a well-known platform that organizes and dissem-
inates cultural heritage information (without using mobile services
for conversation recording). Finally, we distributed the appropriate
questionnaire and gave students enough time to answer the ques-
tions according to their experience.
As an assessment tool we chose to work with questionnaires
based on the Likert scale [4]. We used the typical ﬁve-level Likert
scale consisting of ﬁve available answers in each question: Strongly
Agree (5), Agree (4), Neither Agree nor Disagree (3), Disagree (2),
Strongly Disagree (1). For the last question concerning the
24
Z. Koukopoulos, D. Koukopoulos / Applied Computing and Informatics 15 (2019) 19–26
comparison between the proposed system and Europeana we
asked the students to simply choose one of the two systems. For
the data analysis, we followed the methodology of assessing ques-
tionnaire data proposed in [14] and calculated the mean and pop-
ulation standard deviation of the answers to each question
drawing conclusions.
4.2. Results and discussion
Table 1 displays the results from the analysis of student
answers to the distributed questionnaires. The calculated Cron-
bach’s alpha measure concerning the reliability of the question-
naire produced an acceptable value of 0,75.
Evaluation results reveal that the integration of features from
learning objects theory to the proposed platform was successful.
Students comprehended the independent, reusable and improv-
able nature of educational content while they remained positively
sceptical about items’ ability to be aggregated in collections with
common semantic content. Students’ answers about the integra-
tion of mobile devices are moderately positive. The platform
appears to achieve the goals of collaborative learning and active
student participation. The notable dispersion of answers suggests
that even though the majority of students comprehended student
collaboration services well, a small percentage of students remains
skeptical and aspires for more efﬁcient collaboration services.
Finally, students evaluated platform’s use as an educational tool
very positively without many variations and they would like to
use platform services during a course’s educational procedure.
Attempting a rough comparison of the proposed platform with
Europeana, we asked students which of the two platforms they
would prefer to use as an educational tool. Our purpose was to
get an indication of the acceptance that the proposed platform
had as an educational tool in comparison to an established cultural
heritage platform like Europeana that collects and disseminates
European originated cultural heritage content. Europeana has a
clear educational role offering students the capability to view cul-
tural collections and search for speciﬁc tangible or intangible cul-
tural content. Furthermore, Europeana periodically asks from the
public to contribute cultural heritage information in speciﬁc ﬁelds.
Comparison results between the proposed system and Europeana
(Table 2) revealed that students evaluate both systems almost
equally with respect to their educational usage, but favor the pro-
posed system slightly better with 7 students preferring it instead of
Europeana. Even if this comparison is not an analytical one, it gives
a ﬁrst glimpse of the successful integration of educational services
to the proposed platform.
Overall, the platform seems to accomplish its design goals
which included the integration of characteristics from speciﬁc edu-
cational theories. Students found platform content, services and
modules rather compliant with the main characteristics of learning
objects, mobile learning and collaborative learning theories. Last
but not least, students would be eager to use the proposed plat-
form as a main part of the educational procedure and strongly
comprehended its educational strength.
5. Conclusions
In this work we designed and implemented a uniﬁed educa-
tional platform, which manages to incorporate the main character-
istics of learning objects, collaborative learning and mobile learning
theories beneﬁting both teachers and students. Teachers can use
the platform to present relevant information, upload content, cre-
ate projects, urge students to complete learning tasks individually
or in small teams and perform teaching sessions outside the class-
room. Students can use platform’s interactive services to contribute
primitive or existing cultural content and collaborate in teams with
other students to complete educational tasks. Platform can be the
starting point for students searching information about a speciﬁc
topic. The platform supports seamless learning providing a mobile
application that allows students to capture and annotate cultural
heritage educational content in real-time outside the classroom
and engage in discussions about it with their teacher. Also, teachers
and students can create reusable, independent, aggregation-ready
and meta-data enrichable cultural heritage educational content.
Such content, organized in learning objects based on the LOM Stan-
dard, can become available to the broad educational community.
The presented evaluation results provide a ﬁrst insight towards
the acceptance of the proposed platform from the cultural heritage
educational community. As future work we plan to further evaluate
the proposed system acceptability and satisﬁability from students
in primary and secondary schools. Moreover, we plan to conduct
a thorough comparison between the proposed platform and Euro-
peana addressing the issues of user-friendliness, user satisfaction
and personalization in more depth.
