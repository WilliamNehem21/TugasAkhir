The measurement of aromaticity in biochars is generally conducted using solid state 13C nuclear magnetic reso-
nance spectroscopy, which is expensive, time-consuming, and only accessible in a small number of research-
intensive universities. Mathematical modelling could be a viable alternative to predict biochar aromaticity
from other much easier accessible parameters (e.g. elemental composition). In this research, Genetic Program-
ming (GP), an advanced machine learning method, is used to develop new prediction models. In order to identify
and evaluate the performance of prediction models, an experimental data set with 98 biochar samples collected
from the literature was utilized. Due to the beneﬁts of the intelligence iteration and learning of GP algorithm, a
kind of underlying exponential relationship between the elemental compositions and the aromaticity of biochars
is disclosed clearly. The exponential relationship is clearer and simpler than the polynomial mapping relation-
ships implicated by Maroto-Valer, Mazumdar, and Mazumdar-Wang models. In this case, a novel exponential
model is proposed for the prediction of biochar aromaticity. The proposed exponential model appears better
prediction accuracy and generalization ability than existing polynomial models during the statistical parameter
evaluation.

1. Introduction
Biochar is the product of biomass thermochemical conversion in an
oxygen limited or depleted environment (Woolf et al., 2010; Yuan
et al., 2017). Biochar has received attention recently as a carbon-
negative product and as an effective means to improve soil fertility, as
well as other ecosystem gains such as carbon sequestration to mitigate
climate change (Cao et al., 2014; Cao et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2021;
Czech et al., 2021). The aromaticity is one of the most important prop-
erty of biochars as it can improve the stability of biochars and affect
the soil environment. The biochars, which possess greater proportion
of aromatic C, offer greater chemical recalcitrance and resistance to bio-
logical degradation (Smith et al., 2017; Wiedemeier et al., 2015a). The
fraction of carbons present in aromatic rings is called aromaticity
(Wiedemeier et al., 2015a). Moreover, Han et al. (2014) explored a
positive relationship between the aromaticity of biochar C and their
capacity for organic pollutants adsorption. Singh et al. (2012) discov-
ered that there is a deﬁnite link between the amount of CO2 generated
during a long-term incubation of biochars and their initial proportion
fraction of aromatic C. Obviously, quantiﬁcation of the aromaticity of
biochar C is highly signiﬁcant for their further utilization and could be
the basis for business models.
To quantitatively characterize aromatic C of biochars, a wide variety
of chemical and physical methods have been used, such as Solid state
13C nuclear magnetic resonance (13C NMR) spectroscopy (McBeath
et al., 2011; McBeath et al., 2014), Near-edge X-ray absorption ﬁne
structure spectroscopy (NEXAFS) (Keiluweit et al., 2010), Benzene
polycarboxylic acid (BPCA) analysis (Wiedemeier et al., 2013), lipid
analysis (Wiedemeier et al., 2015b). However, these techniques
are expensive and time-consuming, and only available in research-
intensive universities (Baccile et al., 2014; Wiedemeier et al., 2015a).
Consequently, simple and robust alternatives have been sought to
evaluate the aromaticity of biochars.

Mathematical modelling can be an economically-viable and efﬁcient
alternative for evaluating the degree of aromaticity, since it is possible to
accurately predict the aromaticity of biochar C by using some basic
feature parameters of biochars. Elemental composition data for any bio-
chars are easily obtained and assessed. Due to this reason, Maroto-Valer
et al. (1998a) developed a linear mathematical model for the prediction
of the C aromaticity of bituminous coal by using atomic H/C ratio. How-
ever, the linear Maroto-Valer model has an application limit that H/C
only ranges from 0.5 to 0.8. Therefore, Mazumdar (1999) developed a
more accurate prediction model, derived from polyaromatic hydrocar-
bons (PAH, only including C and H) with a revised densimetric method,
for the C aromaticity by elemental compositions. The model has a better
prediction capacity than the Maroto-Valer model, mainly because for-
mer one considered the structure information of C-atom and H-atom
(Mazumdar, 1999). However, when the Mazumdar model is used for
the prediction of the C aromaticity of biochars, its prediction capacity
is dramatically reduced. Wang et al. (2013) discovered that because
Mazumdar's model only considered C- and H-atoms, the model failed
when applied to biochar. Biochar is a heterogenous material and does
not only involve C-atom and H-atom, it includes other heteroatoms,
such as O, N and S. In this case, Wang et al. (2013) further modiﬁed
the Mazumdar model and obtained a specialized prediction model for
biochar aromaticity, which takes into account the inﬂuence of hetero-
atoms of H, O, and N. Unfortunately, the generalization abilities of the
modiﬁed model is also limited, when the H/C ratio of biochars is more
than 1.0. Therefore, developing new prediction model for biochar
aromaticity with higher generalization abilities is greatly necessary.
Machine learning can effectively perform a modelling task by using
artiﬁcial intelligence algorithms. The machine learning methods directly
“learn” from raw experimental data and develop the functional relation-
ships among the data, even if the physical meaning is unknown or there
is no any prior knowledge about the nature of the underlying relation-
ships (Goldberg et al., 2015; Kankar et al., 2011). Because of these
advanced features, the intelligence method has been used to predict
biochar yield (Cao et al., 2016), to identify inorganic phosphor host
(Zhuo et al., 2018), to study nanomaterial toxicity (Winkler et al.,
2014), as well as to optimize magnetoelastic Fe–Ga alloy microstructure
(Liu et al., 2015). In practice, the adopted intelligence algorithms in-
clude Artiﬁcial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine
(SVM), Bayesian Network (BN), and Random Forest (RF) (Cao et al.,
2016; Jha et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2015; Pan and Pandey, 2016; Winkler
et al., 2014; Zhuo et al., 2018), etc. Although these algorithms are strong
intelligent modelling methods with a wide applicability, the developed
models are “black box” models whose structures and parameters do not
supply any insight into the phenomena underlying the data being
modeled (Jha et al., 2017; Patil-Shinde et al., 2014). Beside “black box”
intelligent algorithms, Genetic Programming (GP) as the advanced sub-
category of machine learning methods has the ability to obtain models
with clear mathematical expression (analytical models) (Bagheri et al.,
2012; Ghugare et al., 2014; Pandey et al., 2015). More importantly, GP
is capable of automatically arriving at an optimized mathematic model
without making any assumptions regarding the structure and parame-
ters of the developing model. The most attractive feature of GP algo-
rithm is that, depending on the nature of dependencies (whether
linear or nonlinear) in the developing data (experimental data), the
technique by itself can choose a suitable model that optimally ﬁts the
developing data based on Darwinian theory of natural selection (Faris
and Sheta, 2013; Pandey et al., 2015; Sharma and Tambe, 2014).
During the modiﬁcation of the Mazumdar model by considering
structure information of heteroatoms (e.g., H, O, and N), there were
introduced several ideal assumptions. For instance, one C=O bond
was replaced by two C–H bonds and one N atom was replaced by a C
atom for the case with high C/N ratios (Wang et al., 2013). Considering
ideal assumptions may cause some key model information to be ig-
nored, which might be the reason why the prediction capacity of the
modiﬁed Mazumdar model is not satisfactory for practical application.
Just as discussed above, during the development of GP-based model,
the model structure is not speciﬁed in advance. Therefore, it is possible
to identify a suitable prediction model with higher generalization
abilities. Accordingly, the principal objectives of this research are:
(1) to develop elemental composition based prediction models for
biochar aromaticity with higher generalization abilities, and (2) to dis-
cover new mapping relationships and rules between the elemental
compositions and C aromaticity of biochars.
2. Methods
2.1. Data collection
To develop robust prediction models for the C aromaticity of
biochars, the experimental data including 98 biochar samples derived
from 13C NMR spectroscopy were collected from previous literatures
(Baldock and Smernik, 2002; Brewer et al., 2011; Cao et al., 2012;
Enders et al., 2012; Kaal et al., 2012; Keiluweit et al., 2010; Manna
et al., 2020; McBeath et al., 2014; Singh et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2013;
Wiedemeier et al., 2015a; Yue et al., 2017), and the detailed data are
provided in the supplementary material ﬁle (Table S1). The biochars
characteristics are diverse because of different feedstock (e.g. 24 kinds
of biomass) and different pyrolysis conditions (charring temperature,
heating rate, and holding time). In this case, the database covers a
wide distribution of C aromaticity and elemental composition. For
example, C aromaticity ranges from 0.1000–1.0000, and the ranges
of H/C, O/C, N/C atomic ratios are 0.0249–1.8076, 0.0171–0.7166,
0.0006–0.0415, respectively.
In order to develop C aromaticity prediction models, the above
collected experimental data were divided into two data sets, e.g. train-
ing set and testing set. The training set was employed to identify the
model parameters, and the testing set was utilized for the evaluation
of the model performance (Cao et al., 2016). To ensure the effectiveness
of the developed model, the training and testing sets were chosen ran-
domly. In this research, 60 samples (about 60% of the prepared data)
were randomly selected as the training set, and the rest 38 samples
were taken as the testing set.
2.2. Modelling methods
2.2.1. Mazumdar-Wang model
Mazumdar (1999) employed a revised densimetric method to
accurately predict the C aromaticity of polyaromatic hydrocarbons
(PAH, including only C and H):
f a ¼ 1− H0
C0 þ α Mc
d −5:34
�
�
ð1Þ
where fa denotes the aromaticity of carbon materials; H0
C0 denotes
the atomic ratio of H and C; Mc
d denotes the average molar volume of
C-atom, decreasing with the increase of the condensation degree of
PAH; α denotes a modiﬁcation coefﬁcient, ranging from 0.115–0.125
for coal samples, increasing with the increase of the C aromaticity.
Notice that the constant, 5.34, is the average molar volume of graphite
C-atom and is taken as the lower Mc
d limit of C. Moreover, the average
molar volume of C-atom, Mc
d , can be estimated by a second-order polyno-
mial model of H0
C0 (Mazumdar, 1999):
Mc
d ¼ 5:34 þ 9:15 H0
C0 −2:9 H0

ð2Þ
Mazumdar model is proposed considering PAH, which includes
only C and H. However, biochar does not only involve C and H, but
also O, N and S. These elements can also affect Mc
d . Considering this factor,
Wang et al. (2013) modiﬁed the atomic ratio of H0
C0:

H0
C0 ¼ H%=1 þ 2θ � O%=16
C%=12 þ N%=14
ð3Þ
Where H % /1, O % /16, C % /12, and N % /14 are the molar fractions of
corresponding elements divided by their molecular weight; θ is the
molar ratio of C=O bond to CO bonds (consisting of aliphatic and O-
aryl C, C–O single bond, and C=O double bond). The modiﬁed model
taken into account the presence of heteratom groups of O and N; One
C=O bond is replaced by 2C–H bonds and one N atom is replaced by a
C atom. In this research, the modiﬁed model is referred as Mazumdar-
Wang model.
2.2.2. Genetic programming modelling method
GP simulates Darwin's theory of biological evolution: “survival of the
ﬁttest” and “genetic propagation of characteristics”; it is an intelligent
evolution strategy which automatically evolves computer programs to
solve the task without specifying the structure of the solution in ad-
vance (Baumes et al., 2009; Gandomi et al., 2015). Hence, the advantage
of GP modelling method is that not only the parameters of models are
identiﬁed automatically but also it can identify the structure of models.
Herein, we consider a multiple input-single output (MISO)
predicting task. Modelling data set is,
D ¼
ðx1, y1
Þ, x2, y2Þ, ⋯, xN, yNÞ
ð
g,
ð
f
ð4Þ
including N data patterns, where xn(n = 1,2,⋯,N) is an M-dimensional
input vector (xn = [xn1,xn2,⋯,xnM]T), and yn is the corresponding model
output. Using the data set D, the GP can ﬁnd the exact form and the as-
sociated parameters of the unknown MISO model (f). The general form
of the model to be solved by GP is given as,
y ¼ f x, ω
ð
Þ
ð5Þ
where ω = [ω1,ω2,⋯,ωQ] denotes a Q-dimensional parameter vector.
At the beginning of the GP, a population of candidate solutions is
randomly generated to the model identiﬁcation problem. As seen in
Fig. 1(a), a candidate solution is coded with a form of trees (gene
expression trees), which forms a candidate model for the model output
of yn when decoded. The tree structure derives from a root node and
involves operator nodes and operand nodes. The operator nodes repre-
sent mathematical operators, e.g. addition, subtraction, multiplication,
division, sine, cosine, exponentiation, etc.; while operand nodes deﬁne
model inputs (x) and parameters (ω). The ﬁtness of each candidate
solution for the predicting task is evaluated by its ﬁtness score, which
is calculated from ﬁtness functions, such as root mean square error
(RMSE). The candidate solutions with high ﬁtness scores are more
probably chosen to create a mating pool termed “parents” for the repro-
duction of new candidate solutions. The new candidate solutions are
produced from the parents by evolution operation of crossover and mu-
tation (Fig. 1(b) and (c)). During crossover operation, a pair of parents
from the mating pool is selected randomly; and then two new offspring
are obtained by tailoring each parent tree at a random point and mutu-
ally exchanging the tailored branches between the parents. The cross-
over operation is addressed with a pre-speciﬁed probability value
termed “crossover probability”. For mutation operation, the changes
are applied to the operator and operand nodes of the parent selected
randomly to generate a new offspring. The mutation operation is also
conducted with a pre-speciﬁed probability termed “mutation probabil-
ity”, which is usually of a small probability. In this reproduction and
iteration way, the satisﬁed predicting model is developed automa-
tically. The detailed implementation processes of the algorithm are
available in literatures (Faris and Sheta, 2013; Pandey et al., 2015;
Patil-Shinde et al., 2014).
2.3. Model performance evaluations
To evaluate the capabilities of the developed models, ﬁve statistical
parameters (e.g. AAE, MAE, RMSE, R2, and ρ) were employed. AAE,
MAE, RMSE, R2, and ρ are widely adopted statistical parameters and re-
spectively represent the Average Absolute Error, Maximum Absolute
Error, Root Mean Squared Error, coefﬁcient of determination, and corre-
lation coefﬁcient. These coefﬁcients are deﬁned as follows (Cao et al.,

change signiﬁcantly via shifting the predicted output of a model
equally, and error functions, such as AAE and RMSE, only indicate the
error not the correlation. Therefore, a comprehensive performance
index (β) is usually used for model performance evaluation (Gandomi
et al., 2016):

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Mazumdar-Wang model
Least square method is utilized for the identiﬁcation of the model
parameters (α in Eq. (1) and θ in Eq. (3)), which is implemented handily
by using the lsqcurveﬁt function in MATLAB software; the identiﬁed pa-
rameters of α and θ are equal to 0.0960 and 0, respectively. Fig. 2 shows
the performance scattered plots of the model on training and testing
data sets, and the corresponding statistical parameters are listed in
Table 2.
The tight cloud of points about 45o line demonstrate that the
Mazumdar-Wang model has a greatly acceptable predicting capac-
ity for the C aromaticity of biochars, especially due to a high coefﬁ-
cient of determination in testing set (R2 = 0.9130). However,
there is obvious difference between the model parameters obtained
in this research (α =0.0960, θ =0) and those developed by Wang
et al. (2013) (α =0.110, θ =0.290). The primary difference is
about the model parameter of molar ratio (θ). Wang et al. (2013)
has revealed that molar ratio, θ, is actually not constant, and changes
with biochar structure: biochars obtained at low temperature have a

135
larger fraction of organic O existing as C–O (accounting for almost
100% of total CO bonds when θ = 0), while those obtained at
high temperature have a higher fraction of organic O as C=O (up
to θ = 1). In this research, there is a quite number of low tempera-
ture biochar samples and the atomic ratio of H/C reaches a maximal
value of 1.8076, but Wang et al. (2013) just considered biochars
with H/C less than 1. Therefore, we have utilized a wider sample
range which could be the reason for the difference of model
parameters.
3.2. GP-based models
For the identiﬁcation of GP-based C aromaticity models, H/C, O/C, N/
C are considered as the input parameters. During the training of the
model, the population size and the maximum number of the generation
were set as 300 and 1000, respectively. To select the parent genes from
the pool of available solutions, the tournament selection strategy was
adopted (Pandey et al., 2015). The tournament size is set to 4. The de-
tailed parameters of the GP algorithm are given in Table 1, which have
Fig. 1. Schematic of genetic programming: (a) basic tree structure, (b) two offspring trees created by crossover operation, and (c) one offspring tree created by mutation operation.

been examined until there was no longer signiﬁcant improvement in
the performance of the GP-based models. Three alternative models
(expression trees) were determined by considering their corresponding
ﬁtness scores and model complexities (see Fig. 3).
As shown in the Fig. 3, the proposed GP-based C aromaticity predic-
tion models are created by the arrangement of operators, variables, and
constants. we can ﬁnd that those models have same root node,
subtraction operation, and then the root node connects different sub-
programs (genes) to form the ﬁnal prediction models. Any individual
aspect of the problem to be modeled is accentuated by each of the sub-
programs so that a meaningful overall solution is identiﬁed (Faris and
Sheta, 2013; Sharma and Tambe, 2014). In this way, the important in-
formation underlying in the problem could be achieved via each of the
evolved subprograms.
Fig. 4 shows the comparison of the experimental against predicted C
aromaticity values from the three prediction models, and the corre-
sponding performance evaluation parameters are given in Table 2. It is
interesting to notice that all three GP-based models have better predic-
tion performances than the Mazumdar-Wang model, due to lower AAE,
MAE, RMSE, and comprehensive performance index (β), as well as
higher R2 and correlation coefﬁcient (ρ). GP-I model predicts the C aro-
maticity using a polynomial combination of H/C and O/C; GP-II and GP-
III models indicate that there are exponential relationships between the
C aromaticity and the elemental atom ratios. Moreover, GP-III model be-
lieves N/C has inﬂuence for the aromaticity prediction, and considers its
effect in the model.
For further veriﬁcation of the GP-based models, box-and-whisker di-
agrams of the prediction errors in testing set were conducted, as shown
in Fig. 5. Box-and-whisker diagram is a standardized way of displaying
the distribution of data based on a ﬁve number summary (“minimum”,
ﬁrst quartile (Q1), median, third quartile (Q3), and “maximum”), which

can quantitatively describe features of the prediction errors to analysis
the accuracy and reliability of the models. Obviously, GP-II and GP-III
models outperform the GP-I and Mazumdar-Wang models. GP-II and
GP-III have smaller median values (0.0017 and 0.0075) than GP-I and
Mazumdar-Wang models (0.0165 and 0.0113), which means the error
centres of former two models are closer to zero. Moreover, there are
no outliers for the predictions of GP-II and GP-III models when the
error distributions are addressed. Regarding the structure of models,
GP-II and GP-III models predict the C aromaticity by exponential func-
tions of elemental atom ratios, but GP-I and Mazumdar-Wang models
utilize polynomial combinations. It is obvious that exponential models
have better prediction accuracy and generalization capabilities over
polynomial models for the prediction of the C aromaticity. These results
implicate that there exists an exponential relationship between the

elemental compositions and C aromaticity, which can more accurately
characterize the underlying rule and information for the prediction of
biochar aromaticity.
3.3. Sensitivity analysis of GP-II and GP-III models
The above statistical results (see Table 2 and Figs. 4 and 5) clearly in-
dicate GP-II and GP-III models have better prediction performances over
GP-I and Mazumdar-Wang models. Moreover, the results also show
that GP-II and GP-III models possess comparable prediction perfor-
mances. For instance, during the veriﬁcation in testing set data, GP-II
has smaller median value, but at the same time has larger MAE and
RMSE; and the two models have almost equal comprehensive perfor-
mance index (β). The primary difference of the two models is GP-III
model includes the contribution from the input parameter of N/C for
the C aromaticity prediction, which results in a model with greater com-
plexity. But GP-II model does not take into account the inﬂuence of N/C,
and has a simple and clear model structure (see Fig. 3). To consider the
inﬂuence of different input parameters, we conducted a sensitivity anal-
ysis for the two models.
The sensitivity (Si) of each input parameter is expressed as follow
(Gandomi et al., 2013b):

in which fmax(xi) and fmin(xi) are respectively the maximum and mini-
mum value of the predicted output (i.e. C aromaticity) over the ith input
domain, where other input parameters are equal to their mean values.
Table 3 presents the results of above analysis for the GP-II and GP-III
models. Obviously, the inﬂuence of N/C for the C aromaticity prediction
is highly small, which can be ignored, because its sensitivity for the out-
puts of the GP-III model is only 2.23%. Therefore, GP-II model should be
the best alternative among these models for the prediction of biochar
aromaticity on account of excellent predicting capacity and simple
model structure.
Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis (Table 3) also clearly demon-
strates that H/C dominantly determines the prediction of biochar aro-
maticity because of larger sensitivity weight over O/C. That could be
an important reason for the fact that H/C is widely used as an approxi-
mating aromatic index (Baldock and Smernik, 2002; Cai et al., 2019;
Hammes et al., 2006; Keiluweit et al., 2010; Wiedemeier et al., 2015a).
Fig. 6(a) shows 3D distribution of the biochar aromaticity under the
prediction of GP-II model, and Fig. 6(b) is the corresponding growing
pathway of the biochar aromaticity with the decrease of H/C. As far as
we know, as pyrolysis temperature increases, raw biomass experiences
charring processes, such as dehydration, depolymerization, volatiliza-
tion and crystallization, eventually leading to the formation of H and O
depleted aromatic C structures (Chen and Yuan, 2011; Fang et al.,
2014; Wiedemeier et al., 2015a; Xiao et al., 2016). In this case, the
biochar aromaticity increases with decreasing of H/C. In addition, the
sensitivity of C aromaticity for O/C reduces with the decrease of H/C
(the red shadow area in Fig. 6(b) becomes narrow with the decrease

of H/C), which primarily is due to the formation of similar molecular
structures (tiny aromatic cluster graphene-like structures) at relative
high pyrolysis temperature (Fang et al., 2014; Maroto-Valer et al.,
1998b; McBeath et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2013). Obviously, the predic-
tion characteristics of GP-II model is greatly consistent with the re-
ported research results. Therefore, the GP-II model is an excellent
prediction models for biochar aromaticity with high predicting accuracy
and generalization ability.
4. Conclusions
The presented results clearly indicate that, compared with polyno-
mial models (e.g. Mazumdar-Wang model), the proposed exponential
models (see GP-II and GP-III models) can more accurately characterize
the underlying mapping relationship between the elemental composi-
tions and the C aromaticity of biochars. Particularly, GP-II model not
only has high predicting accuracy and generalization ability, but also
possesses a simple model structure. Furthermore, the research demon-
strates that mathematical modelling has high potential utility as a pow-
erful tool for predicting biochar aromaticity using easily accessible
feature parameters of biochars, such as elemental compositions, which
can greatly save experimental time and cost. Especially, GP intelligence
modelling method can accurately identify suitable alternatives with
clear mathematic expressions.
