Abstract
Renography, a radionuclide technique integral to medical practice since the 1960s, facilitates individual kidney function measurement in unilateral or bilateral uro-nephrological conditions. This paper presents a novel Renography analysis system aiming for fully automated renal regions of interest (ROI) delineation. Leveraging a multi-agent system incorporating spatio-temporal interest point detection on scintigraphic images via the HOG3D descriptor for agent initialization, our approach utilizes supervisor and explorator agents inspired by the Fast Marching method. Evaluation on real patient cases demonstrates promising results, with clinical validation indicating consistent agreement with manual segmentation by nuclear medicine professionals.

Introduction
Renal dynamic scintigraphy (renography) has become indispensable for renal function assessment, prompting a need for comprehensive software tools adhering to international guidelines. This study proposes an automated ROI delineation method utilizing spatial and temporal interest point detection for contour initialization and a multi-agent system for accelerated processing. Various approaches employing spatio-temporal descriptors and interest point detectors have gained traction. This article presents an automated system for defining renal ROIs using the HOG3D descriptor and Fast Marching Method.

Related Works
Renal ROI definition is a significant topic in literature, with algorithms falling into semi-automatic and automatic categories. Semi-automatic methods enable ROI tracing from an initialization point, while automatic methods require no user intervention. Our objective is to describe an automated system for ROI definition using HOG3D descriptor and Fast Marching Method.

Techniques of Our System
Our team, specializing in video processing, has developed a system based on Spatio-temporal Descriptor for video object segmentation and tracking. The proposed multi-agent system operates concurrently, with agents perceiving and acting independently. The HOG3D descriptor, based on spatio-temporal gradients, quantifies orientation, while the Fast Marching Method efficiently solves boundary value problems.

Proposed System
Our multi-agent system, employing adaptive agents initialized with the HOG3D descriptor, is inspired by the Fast Marching method. Agents cooperate to extract the object frontier, with explorer agents considering nearest neighbors for evolution. The proposed algorithm positions agents on interest points, modifies pixel positions based on nearest values, and resolves conflicts with supervisor agent intervention.

Discussion
Evaluation on patient images demonstrates superior segmentation accuracy and execution time compared to other approaches, validating the effectiveness of our system.

Conclusion
This work presents an automated system for renal ROI detection, streamlining renography analysis without operator intervention. Leveraging a combination of techniques including the multi-agent system, HOG3D descriptor, and Fast Marching Method, our system offers precise results and represents progress in medical image processing, awaiting expert validation.
