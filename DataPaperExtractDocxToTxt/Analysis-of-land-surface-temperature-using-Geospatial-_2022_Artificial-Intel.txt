Degradation of vegetation cover and expansion of barren land are remained the leading environmental problem at global level. Land surface temperature (LST), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Barren Index (NDBaI), and Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) were used to quantify the changing relationships using correlation analysis. This study attempted to analyze the relationship between LST and NDVI, NDBaI, and MNDWI using Geospatial tech- nologies in Gida Kiremu, Limu, and Amuru districts in Western Ethiopia. All indices were estimated by using thermal bands and multispectral bands from Landsat TM 1990, Landsat ETM+ 2003, and Landsat OLI/TIRS 2020. The correlation of LST with NDVI, NDBaI and MNDWI were analyzed by using scatter plot. Accordingly, the NDBaI was positive correlation with LST (R2 = 0.96). However, NDVI and MNDWI were substantially negative relationship with LST (R2 = 0.99, 0.95), respectively. The result shows that, LST was increased by 5 °C due to decline of vegetation cover and increasing of bare land over the study periods. Finally, our result recommended that, decision-makers and environmental ana- lysts should give attention on the importance of vegetation cover, water bodies and wetland in climate change mitigation, particularly, LST in the study area.

Introduction

The majority of human activities are the primary cause of the contin- uous loss of vegetation cover on the earth's surface (Sahana et al., 2016). The decrease in vegetation was a contributing factor to the increase in land surface temperature (LST). Song et al. (2021) highlights that vege- tation is the main influencing factors that driven LST. The LST is one of the crucial indicators of ecological functioning of the environment. The LST is indicates the temperature of the Earth's skin, which is an impor- tant component in regional and global land surface processing studies (Thanh et al., 2018). The LST is increasing at global level due to land use land cover conversion (Moisa et al., 2022a). Studies conducted in different parts of Ethiopia confirmed that there is a substantial

increasing trend of LST (Moisa et al., 2022b; Wolteji et al., 2022; Merga et al., 2022; Dissanayake et al., 2019). Similar to LST, the atmo- spheric temperature is significantly increasing as a results of land use land cover change (Gemeda et al., 2020; Gemeda et al., 2021; Gemeda et al., 2022; Moisa et al., 2022c).
To quantitatively describe degraded land, the Normalized Difference Barren Index (NDBaI) and the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) were used (Gao, 1996; Zha et al., 2003). The LST were compared to the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), NDBaI, and MNDWI to provide ambient environmental condi- tion for living things (Qinqin et al., 2012). Vegetation based indices can indicates the existence and abundancies of vegetation cover (Moisa et al., 2022a; Iang and Tian, 2010).
Analysis of spatial flexibility of the NDVI, LST, NDBaI, and MNDWI are tremendously crucial for decision making and natural resources monitoring in natural and environmental investigations (Zareie et al., 2016). In addition, NDVI has been used to confirm the importance for represent distribution of green space (Yuan and Bauer, 2007). Further- more, several scholars raised that, remote sensing indices like NDVI

and MNDWI were gradually declined due to forest fires, deforestation, expansion of urbanization, agricultural land expansion, and expansion of grazing land from which NDBaI, and LST were increased (Zhou and Wang, 2011; Mimbrero et al., 2014).
Although these indices have been used to model LST in previous study (Chen et al., 2006), only a few of them have compared index re- sults from different years to monitor surface temperature. Even though, agricultural expansion is the main causes that aggravated climate change particularly LST in western parts of Ethiopia. No research has been conducted around Gida Kiremu, Limu, and Amuru district. It is ob- vious that the LST has increased over time due to a decline in vegetation cover for agricultural expansion. In addition, wetland degradation and the increment of barren land were other causes for the rising of LST. Therefore, this study attempted to analyze LST based on remote sensing indices such as NDVI, NDBaI, and MNDWI in western Ethiopia. This paper is organized as follows: the first section introduces the general in- troduction on LST and its correlation with different indices; Section two describes materials and methods which includes the study area descrip- tions, data types and sources, and method of data analysis; Section three presents' results and discussions and the final section concludes the findings of the study.

Normalized difference barren index (NDBaI)
When estimating the thermal environment, NDBaI was chosen to represent barren terrain areas, which often show large variances in thermal characteristics (Zhifeng and Jianjun, 2012). It is estimated using the reflectance of medium infrared (band 5 for Landsat 5 and 7, band 6 for Landsat 8) and thermal infrared (band 6 for Landsat 5 and 7, band 10 and 11 for Landsat 8) satellites (Eq. (3)).

etables (potato, onions, garlic) and fruits like mango, papaya, oranges and bananas are mostly dominants agricultural products of the study areas. The agricultural activity of the study area is mainly depending on rain-fed.

Data types and sources

Landsat images from three years were used in this study. The USGS (http://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/) provides free downloads of the ther- mal and multispectral bands of Landsat TM 990, Landsat ETM+ 2003, and Landsat OLI/TIRS 2020. Detailed information regarding these data is presented in (Table 1). Software used for this study were, ArcGIS
10.3 version and ERDAS imagine 2015.

Method of data analysis

The LST, NDVI, MNDWI, and NDBaI were calculated in this study. The methodology flow diagram of the study was presented in (Fig. 2).

Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)
This index was used to calculate the amount of vegetation covering the earth's surface. The NDVI was estimated using multi-spectral bands from Landsat images collected over the course of the investiga- tion. Band 4 was used to measure near-infrared bands on Landsat 5 and 7, and band 5 was used for Landsat 8. The red band of the Landsat data were measured using band 4 for Landsat 8 and band 3 for Landsat 5 and 7. The formula for this index is presented in (Eq. (1))
Retrieval of land surface temperature (LST)
The mono-window algorithm (Qin et al., 2001), single channel, was created from Landsat TM, ETM+, and OLI/TIRS data (Jiménez-Muñoz and Sobrino, 2003). LST was extracted from Landsat 8 data with one bands using mono window method from band 10. LST is determined by employing the brightness temperature of the two bands of Thermal Infrared (TIR), as well as the mean and difference in land surface emis- sivity (Cheng et al., 2015).

Step I: Conversion of DN in to radiance.
A. Mono window algorithm

Before calculating the brightness temperature, the mono window technique converted the digital data into an at-sensor radiance sensor.
The TM and ETM+ DN value ranges between 0 and 255 (Eq. (4)).
Lλ =   LMAXλ — LMINλ	x (DN — QCALMIN) + LMINλ	(4)
QCALMAX — QCALMIN

where:
QCLA = quantized calibrated pixel value in Digital Number (DN).
LMINλ = spectral radiance scaled to QCALMIN in watts/(meter squared*ster* μm).

NDVI = NIR — R
NIR + R
(1)
LMAXλ = spectral radiance scaled to QCALMAX in watts/(meter squared*ster* μm).
QCALMIN = minimum quantized calibrated pixel value correspond-

The NDVI scale spans from −1.0 to 1.0. For healthy and dense vege- tation, the NDVI values are always between 0.2 and 0.9 (Bustos and Meza, 2015). Vegetation such as rock, water, and barren plains, on the other hand, were represented by values less than 0.1 (Fu and Burgher, 2015).

Modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI)
When modelling the thermal environment, the MNDWI is assigned to represent water areas, which typically display notable variations in thermal characteristics (Xu, 2008; Zhifeng and Jianjun, 2012). The for- mula was developed using the green band (band 2 for landsat 5 and 7,

QCALMAX = maximum quantized calibrated pixel value corre- sponding to LMAXλ in DN = 255.
For Landsat 8, the mono window algorithm (MWA) was also applied to estimate the LST as used by other experts (Aik et al., 2020; Sahana et al., 2016; Atitar and Sobrino, 2009). The Landsat 8 TIRS Digital Num- bers (DNs) for band 10 were first converted into spectral radiance (Eq. (5)).
Lλ = (ML∗QCal) + AL	(5)

average atmospheric temperature, the mono-window algorithm was used to determine the LST (Zhang et al., 2006). The spectral radiance (as mentioned above) of TM and ETM+ Band 6 imaging can also be transformed into a more physically usable quantity (Eq. (6)). The con- version formula is as follows:
K2
T = ln K1 + 1	(6)

where T = Effective at-satellite temperature in Kelvin.
K2 = Calibration constant 2. K1 = Calibration constant 1.
Lλ = Spectral radiance in watts/(meter squared * ster * μm).
For this investigation, mono window algorithm (MW) was also used to calculate LST in landsat 8. It calculates mean land surface emissivity and then to estimates the brightness temperatures from band 10 of landsat 8.

where;
BT: is effective at-sensor brightness temperature (K);

The calculated radiant surface temperatures will be corrected for emissivity using the equation (Eq. (11)):

Analysis of land surface temperature

The spatial pattern of LST in the study area was determined for the years 1990, 2003, and 2020, respectively. In all of the years stud- ied, the northeastern and southwestern parts of the study area had high LST (Fig. 3). The increasing of LST in the study area is associated with the declining of vegetation cover and increasing of bare land.

Due to the existance of substantial vegetation cover, the eastern, central, and western parts of the research region experienced rela- tively low LST.
The mean LST gradually increased from 23.70 °C in 1990 to 24.30 °C in 2003 to 28.70 °C in 2020. From 1990 to 2020, an average temperature

wetland degradation driven by expansion of agricultural land. The LST is expected to increase due to global warming. For instance, Rasul et al. (2012) predict that by 21 century, the temperature will have increased by 1.40 °C to 5.80 °C during the twentieth century which confirmed the present study.


Correlation between LST and NDVI

LST values were discovered to range from maximum temperature (43.2 °C) to minimum temperature (16.9 °C), whereas NDVI values are found to range from 0.50 to −0.53 maximum to minimum. The re- sults show that LST and NDVI have a strong negative correlation (R2 = 0.99). Wolteji et al. (2022) found a moderate negative relationship be- tween NDVI and LST over the Rift Valley Region of Ethiopia. It shows that high LST are more closely related to low vegetation cover and vice versa. The distribution of NDVI over the study period is presented in (Fig. 4). The relationship between the two factors (LST and NDVI) in 2020 is shown in (Table 2 and Fig. 5). This result of study is in line with (Alemu, 2019; Wedajo et al., 2019; Merga et al., 2022) they
confirmed that, LST was increased as decline of vegetation cover and both of them had strong negative relationship.

Correlation between LST and NDBaI

Barren land of the study area is increasing due to agricultural ex- pansion and decline of vegetation cover. The results demonstrate a substantial positive correlation between LST and NDBaI (R2 = 0.96). It demonstrates that high LST can be found on degraded or barren terrain with a high NDBaI value (Fig. 6). The relationship between two parameters was shown in (Fig. 7). The result of the study more consistency with the result of (Zhifeng and Jianjun, 2012) and they stated that barren land was substantial positive correlation with LST.

Correlation between LST and MNDWI

Vegetation water content (wetland) was decreased due to de- cline of vegetation and increasing of LST. Expansion of agricultural

MNDWI, with coefficient determination of (R2 = 0.95). MNDWI is high in the northern and southern parts of the study area (Fig. 8). The findings reveal that high LST are more commonly recorded in low-water locations. The relationship between LST and MNDWI was presented in (Fig. 9). The result is agreed with the result of pre- vious studies (Zhou and Wang, 2011; Zhifeng and Jianjun, 2012). The relationship between LST and other indices were reported in (Table 2). The NDBaI has a direct association with LST, while NDVI and MNDWI have an inverse relationship with LST.


Correlation between LST and Time of study

The mean LST of the study area was correlated the study period. The result shows that mean of LST was positive relationship with time of study with R2 = 0.89. As time increased mean of LST was increased (Fig. 10).

Conclusions

In this article, we use remote sensing data to assess the spatial- temporal LST in relation to NDVI, NDBaI, and MNDWI indices in three districts of western Ethiopia: Gida Kiremu, Limu, and Amuru. Between 1990 and 2020, the temperature of the earth's sur- face increased by 5 °C. Our results concluded that the NDVI and MNDWI have a substantial negative relationship with LST, whereas NDBaI has a positive correlation with LST. Expansion of agricultural land is the main cause for decline of vegetation cover in the study area. Decline of vegetation cover is the cause for decrement of veg- etation water content (wetland) and increasing of barren land. Moreover, LST is increasing over time and expanded to all directions in study area. Based on our findings, this study recommended the community awareness creation to promote the wise use of natural resources for its sustainability. In addition, further studies on the impacts of LST agricultural production can enhance our understand- ing of the impacts of environmental changes on community livelihhoods.
