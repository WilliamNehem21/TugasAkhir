This research work presents a depleted demand inventory model with constant deterioration. The rate of change of demand is assumed to be a time-dependent function. Initial non-zero demand occurs due to advertisements. Advertisement cost is assumed to be constant. Two types of models are considered for two replenishment stra- tegies viz., without shortages and with shortages. This study aims to obtain a suitable policy for replenishment for minimizing the total inventory cost. Four examples about the alterations made in the optimal solutions due to different values of independent parameters used in the models are considered and discussed. Sensitivity analysis is done and numerical illustrations are provided for validating the approach presented.





Introduction

To achieve organisational goals, it is desirable to know the norms and specifics of resources such as labour, goods, finances, etc. These aspects enable decision-makers to frame their objectives for getting maximum profit via utilising limited services and resources. One of their objectives is inventory. Literature on inventory theory has been continuously modified to reflect the most practical characteristics of existing inventory systems.
Two important factors play a major role in inventory. Firstly, the supply chain of almost every company faces the problem of holding stocks of obsolete or deteriorating goods. For, some goods gradually lose their potential usefulness over time; some deteriorate directly as they are stored; some experience physical depletion over time through desertion; and some deteriorate through direct spoilage. Therefore, the best inventory management strategy for this class of products is to minimise the loss caused by deterioration. Secondly, the change in de- mand rates affects their inventory policy.
In this paper, the demand function has two distinct phases: The de- mand rate is a function of time that initially increases, and after some time, begins to stabilise or becomes constant. This demand rate function is referred to as the ramp-type demand function. When a new consumer product brand enters the market, retailers initially invest heavily in transmitters. And when customers are happy with the item’s price and
quality and service rendered by the company, sales volume gradually
increases over a duration, and then, becomes constant. Therefore, the ramp type-demand function must have a minimum of one broken point between the two-time intervals in which it is non-differentiable [1].
Most of the literature available today is on an inventory model with a ramped demand rate, accounting for backorders, stockouts, and dete- rioration. A negative, exponentially deteriorating inventory model was presented by Ghare and Schrader [2]. Covert and Philip [3] replaced the negative exponential with two-parameter Weibull distributions for deterioration rate. Misra [4] and Chakrabarty [5] came up with eco- nomic order quantity models that concentrated on the above type of commodity. Mandal and Pal [6] introduced ramped demand rate for items with constant expiration rate inventory. Wu and Ouyang [7] gave the most suitable solution for the inventory system introduced by Mandal and Pal [6]. Also, they discussed two possible shortage models with ramp-type demand rate functions [1].
Manna and Chaudhuri [8] developed a model in which the deteri- oration rate of the ramped demand goods was time-dependent and the finite production rate is proportional to the demand rate. Panda, Sen- apati, and Basu [9] discussed a single-level inventory model for a seasonal item since the demand rate of seasonal products corresponds to the characteristics of a ramped demand rate. Skouri, Konstantaras, Papachristos, and Ganas [10] developed the model introduced by Covert and Philip, with the ramped demand rate and the Weibull dis- tribution deterioration rate, partial backlog. Skouri, Manna, Kon- stantaras, and Chaudhuri [11] supplemented the work discussed in

Ref. [8] by taking into account the demand rate without bottlenecks, which stabilizes after the production stop time; and the demand rate with bottlenecks, which stabilizes after the production stop time. Moreover, they further modified their model by considering the de- mand rate as a time function [1].
Recently, in contrast to the work above, Ahmed, Al-Khamis, and Benkherouf [12], for the first time, considered a general deterioration rate. Sanni and Chukwu [13] developed an EOQ inventory model for items with a three-parameter Weibull distribution of deterioration [1]. Amutha and Chandrasekaran [14] advanced the EOQ model with quadratic demand and time-dependent carrying cost of inventory. Sri- vastava and Singh [15] built on the inventory model with linear demand by varying the deterioration rates and partial backlogs.
Singh, Mishra, and Pattanayak [16] presented a model with a linear function of deterioration and a “ramp-type demand function. Uthaya- kumar and Karruppasamy [17] provided a model with time-varying
demand for healthcare industries. Shaikh, A.A., and others [18] described an inventory model with addition facility for deteriorating goods with a ramp-type demand and a trade credit policy. Sharma and Kaushik [19] studied the inventory with ramp-type demand and offers with delayed payments. Palanivelu and Chandrasekaran [20] delivered the replenishment strategy for Giffen goods with time-dependent de- mand. Supakar, P., and Mahato, S. K. [21], developed the deteriorating inventory models with and without an advanced payment scheme, and they considered the ramp-type function for the demand rate.
It can be observed that until now, most of the researchers in this
ramp-type demand rate have completely ignored the initial demand or

At the beginning of each period, it is supposed that I is the total
inventory level to slowly decrease during the duration (0, T1) and eventually move to zero at t = T1. Due to the backlog, shortages occur amount of inventory, and market demand and deterioration induce the during the time interval T1 ≤ t ≤ T. Therefore, the differential equation governing the inventory I(t) has two phases of the cycle time T, which are as follows:

particular situations or products, non-zero initial demand will exist. In a	dt
real-life situation, there is an initial demand for newly launched items
—D(t)T1 ≤ t ≤ T

such as mobile phones, computers, software, automobiles, etc., before they enter into the market because of the advertisement or canvassing. It moves upward with time when these items are launched, and after some time, it begins to stabilise.
In the healthcare industries too, newly introduced medicines have an initial demand before they are available in the market. Nonzero initial demand is also possible due to pre-booking or reserving of that product [22–24]. This paper contributes to that type of demand and takes into
consideration the constant deterioration rate and constant holding cost.
A ramp-type demand rate function is assumed here. The model is first discussed under the assumption that there is no inventory shortage, and then, extended to account for the shortage [25,26].
Here is how the rest of the article is structured: The assumptions and symbols as well as the description and formulation of Model-I, both without the shortage and with the shortage are presented in Section 2. It also includes some numerical examples to provide further insights. Section 3 presents a sensitivity analysis for the model parameters. The results thereof are presented in Section 4. Section 5 finally draws a conclusion of the study.

Materials and methods

This part of the paper presents the assumptions made, symbols used, and the formulation of the model used in this study.

Assumptions
Inventory system considers only one item.
Demand rate is characterized by a time-dependent function of the ramp type.
Time horizon is infinite.
There is a constant holding cost.
There is an unbounded replacement rate.
There has been no lead time.
There is a constant deterioration rate, and no replacement is required during the cycle.
Mathematical model

Model 1 - deterministic model without shortage
As mentioned earlier, demand for these types follows a ramp-type demand rate function. Let us consider this function as-
D(t) = a + bt + b(μ — t)H(t — μ), where a and b are non — negative	(2) Where H(t —μ) is a piecewise continuous ‘Unit Heaviside function’,
H(t — μ) = { 1, μ ≤ t
The shortages can be avoided if the stock is replenished instantly when stock levels become sufficiently low or reach zero (see Fig. 1). There are no shortages in Model I, but this assumption is relaxed in

Model II – inventory model with shortage
A company policy restricts the shortages of any of their products. Shortage costs occur when the required quantity of the good (demand) exceeds the available inventory. The company that has a supply shortage with its customers has to bear the shortage cost. This can be interpreted

on solving equations (2) and (3),
as the loss of goodwill with customers and the resulting unwillingness to
do business with the company. That is, it includes the cost of belated

From Fig. 5, it is seen that the cycle length and economic order quantities decrease as the parameter ‘b’ increases. However, there is an increase in the total cost.
From Fig. 6, it can be seen that with an increase in the deterioration rate, the cycle length and the economic order quantities decrease. However, the total cost increases.
From Fig. 7, it is evident that an increase in the holding cost will lead to the increase of total cost. The cycle length and the economic order quantities decrease.

5. Conclusion

This paper has proposed an inflated model for a time-dependent demand of the ramp type with a constant holding cost, constant advertisement cost, and expiration rate, taking into consideration two conditions viz., with and without shortage. The model provides an overall solution for reducing inventory holding costs is provided. So, it is also quite feasible for the latest technologies used for goods inventory and healthcare industry products under time-dependent demand. This
approach’s sensitivity was verified by considering the different param- eters of the system. This replenishment policy can be used for com-
modities such as fashion items, healthcare products, and milk products whose expiry rates increase with time. This can help policymakers in successfully and effectively managing practical problems. There are
numerous opportunities to expand the future model. Partial backlogs, lost sales, shortage substitution, allowable withholding of payments, nonlinear ramped function rates of demand, fuzzy demand rates, etc. are some factors to be considered.
