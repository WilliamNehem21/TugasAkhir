In this article, we focus on the hybrid of orthogonal and non-orthogonal broadcasting. The hybrid configuration is raised and proposed for improving cellular digital television broadcasting (CDTB) technology. The hybrid scheme is configured as layered division multiplexing (LDM) multiplexed with an evolved multimedia broadcast multicast service (eMBMS) standalone layer is superimposed. The LDM and eMBMS are sub-sections of power division-non orthogonal multiple access (PD-NOMA) and long-term evolution (LTE) respectively. We assume perfect knowledge of the channel state information (CSI) over the Rayleigh fading multipath channel. The bit error rate (BER) and outage probability performance criteria are investigated. The impact of injection level using the fractional transmit power allocation (FTPA) algorithm is discussed. The proposed hybrid can operate in conditions without a subscriber identity module (SIM) card for uplink beamforming and internet protocol (IP). The broadcast network provider selection is feasible by the user equipment (UE) device. Performance analysis is derived based on the exact closed-form expressions, which allows the theory of hybrid proposed LDM/eMBMS consistent with results. Evaluations and performance will be done based on the Monte Carlo iterative method- ology. The results show that the performance and efficiency will be increased when a proposed hybrid LDM/ eMBMS configuration is compared with LDM and eMBMS services individually.





Introduction

After 5G and beyond (B5G) cellular technology, the trend towards hybrid cellular digital television broadcasting (CDTB) are increased. The cellular hybrid configuration realizes user coverage fairness, low la- tency, massive connectivity, spectral efficiency, compatibility, and selectivity in radio access methods [1–3]. There was created a gap be-
tween the digital terrestrial television broadcasting (DTTB) versus CDTB
in terms of service-layers technology selection [4]. The history of the physical layer of cellular broadband infrastructure generations shows that is changed and shifted approximately once every decade for instance 4G to 5G. While the television broadcast has changed over time, for instance in analog television (ATV) to digital television (DTV) tran- sition the national television system committee (NTSC-3.58) converted to advanced television system committee (ATSC) standard in USA or phase alternation line (PAL) converted to digital video broadcasting-terrestrial (DVB-T) in Europe and NTSC-J converted to integrated service digital broadcast (ISDB) in Japan [5,6]. Besides, there is an approach to broadcasting between broadcast owners to supply and
deploy live video transmission among point to multipoint (PTM) and streaming delivery services [7].
Moreover, restrictions are imposed by the international telecom- munication union (ITU) to reduce broadcast bandwidth and increase broadband bandwidth that is named digital dividend, and the coexis- tence of broadcast and broadband in the ultra-high frequency (UHF) spectrum is regulated by local radio frequency organization policy im- plications [8].
There is a challenge in historical inconsistency for operators to synchronize with different technologies. There are incompatibility and contradictions in DTTB infrastructure versus CDTB technology. For instance era of wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA) in broadband versus digital video broadcasting-handheld (DVB-H) in broadcast technology initially [9–11].
To address these challenges broadcast holders and broadcast owners
are suggested a juxtaposition approach [12]. The subject will offer a set of challenges and opportunities for CDTB recipients and broadcast ser- vice providers (BSPs) [13]. Nowadays, BSPs looking to pick out an alternative to next-generation platform CDTB technology using existing

structures gap physical layers [14]. They are emerged as a possible so- lution to have hybrid technology using a multi-layer delivery system recommended by researchers in the last few years [15]. To develop the provide technologies that can satisfy such mandates, the convergence broadcast and broadband and hybrid broadcast and broadband (HBB) are being researched and developed as a kind of integration methods worldwide for decades [12,16,17].
Furthermore, great advancements are achieved in terms of integra- tion technologies such as using the Long Term Evolution-broadcast (LTE-B) and power division-non orthogonal multiple access (PD- NOMA) simultaneously [18].
The LTE-B introduced evolved Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Ser- vices (eMBMS) as an orthogonal and PD-NOMA introduced layered di- vision multiplexing (LDM) as non-orthogonal service providers [19,20]. The eMBMS operates as a PTM intermediary live big-data transmission. The technology is expected to play a significant role in reducing the loading of delivering multimedia streaming for future cellular broad- casting. Also, the technology will support geographic positioning in- formation updates such as local news, climate and traffic reports, stocks
value and exchange, telemedicine, video conference, mobile TV, and related services [7,21–23].
In recent years studies of the 3rd Generation Partnership Project
(3GPP) TV Enhancements (EnTV) have suggested a further evolved MBMS (FeMBMS), known as 5G broadcast, and it is based on 4G LTE. Authors in Ref. [24] enhanced the FeMBMS feature is flexibility in ca- pacity, which it can allocate up to 100% sub-frames to broadcast mode in Rel-14, while formerly, up to 60% sub-frames and 40% sub-frames to broadcast and unicast mode have been allocated in the eMBMS Rel-13
respectively [25–28]. The LDM is a sub-section of PD-NOMA, which is a form of physical-layer non-orthogonal that uses the available spectrum
resource blocks (RBs) by assigning a different power value to each user. The infrastructure of LDM technology is based on two layers namely, the upper layer (UL) and the lower layer (LL) [29–31]. It can serve as a
platform for both mobile and stationary services, which is used in the
future digital TV standard within 3GPP LTE 5G new radio (NR) releases 15,16,17 for next cellular broadcasting [32]. Also, LDM can achieve high spectrum performance when multiplexing various services (indoor, handheld, mobile, stationary) with different requirements and data rate throughputs standard-definition television (SDTV), high definition television (HDTV), 4k, 8k, surround audio using the same spectrum resource [29]. The LDM has the ability operates to transmit high data rates fixed service on LDM-LL and low data rates mobile service on LDM-UL as non-orthogonality [23,33,34].

We mentioned at the beginning that in addition to the challenges, there is an opportunity in terms of orthogonal and non-orthogonality. Hence, our interest in this paper is considered on hybrid orthogonal and non-orthogonal multi-layers networks [38]. Eventually, in this paper, to gain victory over the mentioned drawbacks and opportunities. The cellular hybrid LDM/eMBMS configuration is illustrated as an in- termediate method for overcoming the changes in the physical structure gap of mobile and broadcast systems, which has been studied in terms of technology service-layers [49].
Fig. 1 illustrates a simplified schematic proposed configuration. A transmitter and receiver downlink cellular single-cell next-generation base station (gNB). A single input single output (SISO) downlink trans- mission is broadcasting. The LDM non-orthogonal and the eMBMS orthogonal signals are superimposed on the different frequency archi- tecture [34].
In our scenario assumed, there are three BSPs in a single cell, namely, BSP1, BSP2, and BSP3 are superimposed that is based on power level for the LDM-LL, LDM-UL, and eMBMS services in a cellular single-tier respectively. The LDM-LL broadcasts fix service high data rate and LDM-UL and eMBMS mobile broadcasts mobile service low data rate in a channel simultaneously. The BSP1 and BSP2 work in the same radio frequency and BSP3 has a different frequency. The GLL, GUL, GeMBMS denotes channel gains from the gNB station for LL near user and UL far user and eMBMS middle user respectively. The LDM signal carries two users per sub-carrier, while eMBMS carries a single user per sub-carrier simultaneously in a channel [50].
The LL is a near user with strong received signal and lower power transmission and higher channel gain factor from the gNB station, which has a high-level modulation and larger signal constellation for carrying stationary service. The UL is a far user with weak received signal and

In this subsection, The power-domain downlink hybrid non- orthogonal/orthogonal LDM/eMBMS cellular system model will be introduced. The gNB station, which has an M RB, includes K sub-carriers and U users. We have two group users, called LDM users and eMBMS users. Furthermore, we have two group RBs, the LDM, and the eMBMS.

There is the convenience of choosing a BSPs for the UDs.
The proposed system is performed based on closed-form exact BER
and outage performance statements over a multi-path downlink Rayleigh fading channel.
It is possible improving BER performance for the LDM-UL by using varying injection level factors instead of fixed ones to achieve multi-
service multi-rate programs from SDTV up to Ultra-HDTV.
Due to the feature of broadcasting, the proposed broadcast system
downlink will be able to operate without a subscriber identity module (SIM card) uplink and internet protocol (IP) in times of crisis.

Proposed system description

In this section, first, the proposed model description is presented and then followed by the basic mathematical formulation theory in sub- sections.
the system model in three sub-figures transmitter-receiver and fre-
quency RBs spectrum as a,b,c.
On the transmission side Fig. 2.a the data generated in two-source, eMBMS, and LDM. So, the LDM has two source layers. In the UL, data pass through the bit interleaved coding modulation (BICM) processes.
Meanwhile, the LL data pass from the BICM process too, then the resultant LL signal is multiplied by, ,g, injection power level factor. In
the end, output signals of two layers are superposed together in the power domain [51]. Afterward, the LDM output coefficients power layers are normalized to one. The LDM two layers multiplied by, 1/ 1 + g, in the entrance of the multiplexer. Thereby, the eMBMS part passes from the BICM and multiplexed with the LDM part. The result is generated total transmitting signal. As seen in Eq. (1), the ultimate signal is converted from serial to parallel, after that, both combination LDM and eMBMS signals are subcarrier-mapped. The mapped signal passes into the Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT).
IFFT converts the signal from the frequency to the time domain. The guard interval is provided by the cyclic prefix (CP), which CP removes the inter symbol interference (ISI) from the previous symbol. Then the signal is converted from digital to analog and it can be up-converted into a radio frequency (RF) ultra-high-frequency band. The signal passes through the multi-path Rayleigh fading wireless channel. The Rayleigh fading channel is suitable for describing wireless channels in densely high power high tower (HPHT) broadcasting populated urban centers [34,52].
On the reception side Fig. 2.b, is shown that the radio frequency is down-converted and CP is removed [53] from the received signal. The FFT converts the signal from the time domain to the frequency domain and the signal is demodulated. The limitations of the superimposed signal by estimation and equalization block are solved. The LDM signal carries two users per sub-carrier and eMBMS carries a single user

simultaneously in a channel [50]. Then de-normalized power for LDM and de-multiplexed composed signal. The LDM signal is demodulated using successive interference cancellation (SIC) two layers. The SIC decoding instruction is based on the ordered channel gain (G) infor- mation.Finally in signal decoding the eMBMS signal will be decoded using the regular receiver [54] that hybrid receiving configuration is shown in Figs. 1 and 2.
The SIC block in the receiver part is explained as follows, the strong user UL signal which is far from gNB station is decoded by treating the LL
Problem formulation

Assume there are M RBs and at the mth RB there are Km sub-carriers. The number of LDM and eMBMS RBs are Ψ and Ω, respectively. If all the RBs are occupied with LDM and eMBMS data than the total number of RBs can be written in terms of Ψ and Ω as follows M = Ψ + Ω. So the kth sub-carrier mapping of the LDM or eMBMS symbol to the mth RB can be
given as
Xm [k] = αm XLDM m [k] + β ,p̅̅̅e̅M̅̅̅B̅̅M̅̅S̅̅XeMBMS m [k]

ference and attempts in coherent decoding without SIC perform. Then UL signal is subtracted from the main composite signal if the UL signal is decoded successfully. Afterward, LL signal near user which has high interference and low power, is decoded with performing SIC. Also, the eMBMS signal is de-multiplexed and decoded by a normal user receiver, because we used multiplexing in the transmitter. At the end of this sub- section, for more interpretation and complete theoretical description of the block diagram the hybrid LDM/eMBMS proposed system model in the frequency domain Fig. 2.c is illustrated.
for m = 1, 2, …, M and k = 1, 2…., Km
where αm and βm are allocating coefficients to mth RB for LDM and eMBMS systems respectively. To select LDM symbol for the mth RB take αm = 1 while βm = 0 and to select eMBMS symbol βm = 1 while αm = 0. Here the symbol carried in the kth sub-carrier of mth RB in case of LDM allocation, XLDM,m[k], is the summation of UL symbol XUL,m[k] and LL symbol XLL,m[k] with having transmit powers of PUL,m[k] and PLL,m[k]. In
this paper, we assume that these transmit powers do not change sub- carrier to sub-carrier and RB to RB, so we will drop sub-carrier and RB indices. Therefore, the superposed transmit LDM symbol can be written as follows,

XLDM,m[k] = √P̅̅̅U̅̅̅L̅XUL,m[k] + √P̅̅̅L̅̅L̅̅XLL,m[k]	(2)
sampled received signal after removing CP samples with using Eq. (12) as

So in an LDM RB, there can be two users. And for eMBMS RB, only one user can be allocated. LL sub-carriers power is changed with an injection level of g and the summation power is normalized to PLDM so the transmit powers of LL and UL can be written in terms of PLDM as follows

BER analysis

In this sub-section, BER performance expressions for the UL and LL of the LDM part proposed hybrid system are obtained based on Kara and
Kaya’s derivations [36,37]. We investigated that in Refs. [36,37], their
work considered a single carrier system and over a flat fading channel, our work considers to multicarrier so, some manipulations will be needed to obtain formulas that matched our multicarrier system and multipath Rayleigh channel assumption [49]. The error probability of the UL is as follows

PUL (e) = 1 [(1 — √̅̅̅̅̅γ̅̅A̅̅̅̅̅̅ ) + (1 — √̅̅̅̅̅γ̅̅B̅̅̅̅̅̅ ) ]	(21)

FTPA Algorithm for LDM multi-services

Due to its low computational complexity, FTPA is widely adopted in OFDMA and PD-NOMA systems [47,58]. In the FTPA, the transmit power of LDM RBs on sub-carrier kth (SCk) is allocated according to the channel gains of all the multiplexed users on SCk, which is given as follows

getting worse compare to the with FTPA case. Moreover, using FTPA has an impact on UL BER performance and obviously on LDM. Since FTPA has no gain on LL BER performance, the effect on LDM is not as clearly visible as UL BER performance.

Outage analysis

Generally, outage probability performance is a relevant criterion for the assessment of the quality of service. It measures the probability of failing to achieve an output SNR threshold value required for the desired service outage probability is defined as the probability that the instan- taneous sum rate falls below a certain pre-determined threshold value, i. e., R0 [59–61].
Since the proposed system is a multi-carrier system consisting of the
LDM and the eMBMS parts, we can write the outage probability as sub- carrier based and the summations of LDM and eMBMS sub-carriers outage probabilities as shown in the following equation.

Simulation parameters are given in Table 3. Simula- tion results presented in three main parts 1) The BER performance illustrated for LDM, eMBMS as individually, and hybrid non- orthogonal/orthogonal proposed configuration. 2) FTPA power alloca- tion algorithm results for LDM is investigated 3) Outage probability performance for LDM, eMBMS as individually, and hybrid non- orthogonal/orthogonal proposed configuration will be shown.

near, the near user has a better BER performance than the far user. So, we assume the average frequency domain channel coefficient for UL is 3 dB lower than LL. To compensate for this issue, we adjust fixed

normalized transmit powers for UL and LL as PLL = 0.4 and PUL = 0.6. But still in the SNR to be 10 dB point and increase up to 24 dB, the LDM- LL outperforms BER performance than the LDM-UL. It is assumed an equal number of LDM and eMBMS RB allocations as Ω = Ψ = 8.
Simulation results, as shown in Fig. 4 the BER performance of LDM
and eMBMS with the hybrid proposed framework versus SNR(dB) is compared, which are derived in Eqs. (32) and (35) with LDM technol- ogy. For a fair comparison, we assume normalized average frequency domain channel  coefficient  for  eMBMS users like  LL  users,
E HeMBMS2  = E HLL2  = 0 dB, and normalized transmit power for
eMBMS users PeMBMS = PLL + PUL = 1. We use QPSK modulation for eMBMS, the bits per symbol is beMBMS = log24 = 2. Although we use SIC for LDM users, residual interference causes BER performance degrada- tion, therefore from Fig. 4 it can be seen that the eMBMS performance outperforms the LDM and the proposed overall hybrid system perfor- mance lays down in between. As expected, the hybrid proposed frame- work simulation results are shown that the overall performance average has been located between LDM and eMBMS technologies individually. However, eMBMS can provide better performance since it can support single users, and consequently, the probability to satisfy the isolation constraint will increase in the edge of borders and the coverage region between BSPs.
The BER performance of the proposed system is more than LDM and less than eMBMS compared to the other two technologies. As mentioned the proposed system BER Performance plot is placed lays down between LDM and eMBMS.


FTPA algorithm results for LDM

In this sub-section, we evaluate the impact of the FTPA algorithm on BER performance to achieve PLL and PUL power allocation for LDM layers, which is shown in Figs. 5 and 6.
In Table 4 fixed power allocation values, PLL = 0.4 and PUL = 0.6 as without (w/o) FTPA are given. Also, in Table 5 power allocation values calculated with FTPA impact for different average channel coefficient of
E HUL2 =—3, —5, —7 dB are given. Hence, from Figs. 5 and 6 it can be seen the effect of the FTPA algorithm compared without FTPA out- performs BER performance on both LDM and UL layer. From Fig. 5 it can
be seen that fixed power allocation values match exactly in —7 dB
channel coefficient power value. For other average channel coefficient values, BER performance is getting worse compare to with FTPA case. Moreover, using FTPA has an impact on UL BER performance and obviously on LDM. Since FTPA has no gain on LL BER performance, the effect on LDM is not as clearly visible as UL BER performance in Fig. 5. As shown in Fig. 6 the impact of the FTPA algorithm on BER per- formance for LDM layers with different path losses are demonstrated. In our novel we assume LL to be set 0 dB, while LDM changes to be (—3, —5,
—7)d B, attenuation path loss (channel coefficient gain). In Fig. 6 we evaluate the BER performance of the LDM part with different attenua- tion levels for the UL channel without and with the FTPA algorithm. We assume, that the user in the UL channel is far from the gNB station, and, therefore, path loss attenuation is high. When the UL is looking for different path losses (—3, —5, —7)dB, the user in LL is kept to 0 dB. As can be seen from Fig. 6 the worst performance is a value of — 7 dB, and — 3 dB is the best path loss for the LDM. The exact closed-form simulation and theoretical outperforms BER performance for the LDM compared with the UL channel.
In Fig. 7 the simulation results for the proposed overall system with different numbers of eMBMS RBs allocation BER performance is illus- trated. In this figure, in every scenario, the number of occupied RBs is the same and M = 16, but the number of eMBMS RBs, Ω, are sequentially
taken{0, 4, 8, 12, 16}and so the number of LDM RBs,Ψ, are taken {16,
12, 8, 4, 0}. It can be easily seen that while increasing the number of eMBMS RBs, Ω. The proposed hybrid framework led to improved BER performance, on the contrary, decreasing the number of LDM RBs,Ψ,
lead to the proposed hybrid system’s BER performance.
In Fig. 8. The BER performance of the proposed hybrid framework versus the number of eMBMS RBs (Ω) under fixed SNR equal = 24 dB is shown. The number of eMBMS RBs (Ω) increased from 0 to 16 (the
number of LDM RBs (Ψ) decreased from 16 to 0). The result shows that
the overall performance increased with the number of eMBMS

Outage performance results

In this sub-section, outage probability simulation results in Figs. 9 and 10 will be shown.
Fig. 9 shows outage probability performance versus the total trans- mitted power. The eMBMS based on the OFDMA technique is operated and carries one user per subcarrier instantaneously, while the LDM two layers which based on NOMA technology carry two users per subcarrier concurrently, hence increase the throughput sum-rate per RBs.The figure shows that the efficiency of LDM is better than the eMBMS

performance. So, compared with the eMBMS single-layer mobile system, the efficiency of the LDM has been increased. It can be seen from Fig. 9 results, that the LDM outage probability performance outperforms the eMBMS technology.
As illustrated in Fig. 10 LDM-LL, LDM-UL, and eMBMS technology
outage probability performances are compared with the hybrid pro- posed configuration. The LDM-LL near user has a better outage perfor- mance than the far user LDM-UL. Also, eMBMS user outage performance is increased and match with LDM-LL exactly. The eMBMS layer outage performance outperforms compared with LDM-UL, while the LDM-UL

outage performance decreased. where the eMBMS carries one user and LDM carries two users on the sub-carrier concurrently. Hence, it is increased the efficiency of the LDM two-layer system compared to the eMBMS single-layer mobile system and consequently, overall system performance is increased. As expected from Fig. 10. The hybrid configuration offers the median outage probability. This is due to the proposed hybrid configuration for improving the throughput rate (as mentioned we given outage performance based on sum rate in sub- section 3.3) and flexibility in the radio access selection. Hence, led to improved outage probability performance. This is one of our claims about combination hybrid configuration.

Conclusion and future suggestions

In this article, we have nominated a novelty approach for radio
access that can dynamically select an appropriate technology among LDM and eMBMS based on the average CSI. This attitude is concentrated on a configuration for CDTB infrastructure technology. The issue sug- gested a hybrid of orthogonal/non-orthogonal multi-radio layers broadcasting multiple services. We investigated the mathematical per- formance of hybrid LDM/eMBMS versus the individual single-layer service provider. We studied the impact of three BSPs through single- cell downlink beamforming over the Rayleigh fading multipath chan- nel for presenting mobile/stationary services. The system has two binary
switches for radio access service selection. The service assignment bi- nary switch has used two factors. These factors illustrated with αm and βm symbols. The BER performance in LDM and UL channel response gain investigated with FTPA algorithm. An exact closed-form BER and Outage rate performance are analyzed. The system can work without SIM card uplink way and IP for situation crises. MATLAB simulations shown that both theoretical expressions and plots are matched exactly. It
is concluded from this research that non-orthogonal and orthogonal hybrid framework technology has outperformed BER and outage rate performance compared to a solitary technology. Therefore, we proposed that for next-generation CDTV as a middle infrastructure for broadcast network owners. In a special case, we recommend it for next-generation CDTB broadcast.
The optimization problem of the system is one of the most important future directions to continue the work on the orthogonal and non- orthogonal hybrid configuration. We intend to optimize BER and sum- rate versus transmission power for the hybrid system. The stochastic geometric tool are used to study of random hybrid LDM/eMBMS tech- nologies. Utilization of stochastic processes to achieve an optimal output for instance using the Poisson point process will analyze the hybrid configuration network.
