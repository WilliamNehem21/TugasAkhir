Selecting the best solution to deploy an ambulance in a strategic location is of the important variables that need to be accounted for improving the emergency medical services. The selection requires both quantitative and qualitative evaluation. Fuzzy set based approach is one of the well-known theories that help decision makers to handle fuzziness, uncertainty in decision making and vagueness of information. This paper proposes a new decision making method of Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Simple Additive Weighting (IT2 FSAW) as to deal with uncertainty and vagueness. The new IT2 FSAW is applied to establish a pref- erence in ambulance location. The decision making framework defines four criteria and five alternatives of ambulance location preference. Four experts attached to a Malaysian government hospital and a uni- versity medical center were interviewed to provide linguistic evaluation prior to analyzing with the new IT2 FSAW. Implementation of the proposed method in the case of ambulance location preference suggests that the ‘road network’ is the best alternative for ambulance location. The results indicate that the pro- posed method offers a consensus solution for handling the vague and qualitative criteria of ambulance location preference.

Introduction

Ambulance services and paramedic are very significant in soci- ety as they could save hundreds of lives daily by responding to emergency calls. They operate from stations that normally located in diverse areas to a medical center or hospital. With the assistance of control centers that responded to emergency calls, ambulances are dispatched when required. Ambulances are not always based in a building, but often at a very rudimentary location, such as parking lots [1]. More importantly, they are periodically rede- ployed to ensure a better coverage at all times. According to a study [2], a facility (ambulance) that is near a request point pro- vides a better quality of coverage to that demand point than a facil- ity situated a long way from that request point. Generally, ambulances do not patrol on streets between calls, but once they dispatched to the scene of an incident, they may be diverted to a

more important call. Study of ambulance is part of emergency medical services (EMS). EMS is defined by the National Board of Health and Welfare as ‘‘health care provided by healthcare profes- sionals within or adjacent to the ambulance” [3]. EMS is one the essential measures to optimize the safety of patients and also for sustaining human well-being. EMS is known as pre-hospital treat- ment and also known as services provided by hospital for emer- gency services to transport patients with illness and injuries to the hospital immediately to reduce patients’ mortality, disability or suffering [1,4]. Management of the efficient EMS system is very critical and deserves particular attention by system planners [5]. The availability of an ambulance at a location may influence a chance of survival despite the minute difference of ambulance’s arrival. Ambulance location is in a stochastic environment where the request calls arrive at the control center in a random manner. Travel time for a certain journey may contain randomness; the ser- vice time at the request call’s scenes and hospitals is also uncer- tain. The above mentioned typical process of ambulance request and ambulance fulfillment processes as well the uncertain environ- ments complicate the process of determining the strategic location for ambulances.
Recently, many efforts have been made to strengthen emer- gency management, particularly with respect to the placement of ambulances. A parallel tabu search heuristic [6,7], and stochastic

optimization model [8,9] and local search heuristic [10] are among the methods used in redeployment problem for a fleet of ambu- lances. Recently, a study [11] proposed a dynamic ambulance man- agement model for relocating idle ambulances that incorporate different performance measures related to response times. Study
[12] used approximate dynamic programming (ADP) to solve ambulance dispatching and relocation problem. The ADP model has reduced the response time in the city of Vienna, the capital of Austria to 12.89%. This improvement is due to the main source for improvement which are the dispatching and relocation deci- sions. Study [13] adapted maximum expected coverage location problem model to determine the strategic location for a mobile ambulance in Shah Alam Selangor. Study [14] successfully imple- mented maximal covering location problem using local Open- StreetMap geodata together with Dijkstra, Quick Hull and Greedy Adding algorithms to solve the ambulance location selection in Johor Bahru Malaysia. Very recently, [15] analysed relocation strategies of ambulances using Double Standard Model to ensure a fair comparison of their performance. The above review supports the assertion that ambulance location management is tantamount to operational research problems. According to [16], emergency management is often conceptualized as a complex multi- objective optimization problem where an emergency situation is solved with limited resources. Therefore, the ambulance location problem is indeed a problem where multiple qualitative resources need to be considered concurrently.
It is shown that the existing literatures mostly deal with a specific operation, including ambulance placement with the aim to make an improvement for EMS. The methods used for the improvement varied from typical operations research methods to computational intelligence methods depending on respective research frameworks. However, the methods of multi-criteria deci- sion making (MCDM) in the case of ambulance locations are rarely discussed despite the multiplicity in ambulance locations and qualitative criteria. Simple additive weighting (SAW) is one of the weighted based MCDM methods. This method is also known as a weighted linear combination or scoring method. One of the advantages of SAW method is proportional linear transformation of the raw data where the relative order of magnitude of the stan- dardized scores remains equal. This method was used by [17] to accelerate the mechanism through eliminating unnecessary trade-offs. By using SAW method, a combined consequence of issues having high variation was obtained. As an extension of SAW, another weighted based MCDM method is fuzzy simple addi- tive weighting (FSAW). The FSAW method depends on fuzzy num- bers rather than the crisp numbers. It utilizes trapezoidal fuzzy numbers to show any imprecision in scores and weights. The FSAW method applies fuzzy weighting to approach experts’ preferences. In literature, the FSAW has been successfully applied in diverse
numbers are used in linguistic scales. The introduction of IT2 FS in the FSAW gives a new look to the FSAW framework. The pro- posed method of interval type-2 FSAW is an extension of interval fuzzy additive weighting where T1 FS is substituted with IT2 FS. An IT2 FS is described by the footprint of uncertainty where this footprint is bounded by the lower membership function and upper membership function [25]. This footprint adds a new description of uncertainty. In addition, rather than the direct computation of typ- ical defuzzification method, our proposed method applies the fuzzy ranking method as to reduce T2 FS to T1 FS. This proposed approach allows each decision matrix is made with trapezoidal IT2 FS as a measurement scale instead of using classical trapezoidal fuzzy numbers to represent the judgment scales and the weights of criteria. Unlike the FSAW method, we used the fuzzy ranking method based on IT2 FS as a reduction method. By incorporating fuzzy ranking method, this method offers a more detailed and comprehensive procedure. Although we used the IT2 FS linguistic scales and fuzzy ranking method, the proposed method is made without loss of generality the FSAW procedure. The proposed method could be employed to solve ambulance placement problem where limited qualitative resources and stochastic environment are present. The proposed method also inclusively considers experts’ ambiguities, uncertainties and vagueness in evaluating ambulance location. Specifically, this paper aims to develop a new FSAW decision making method based on IT2FS (IT2 FSAW) and its application to a case of ambulance location preference in EMS management. The remainder of the paper is organized as fol- lows. In Section 2, we present some basic notations and definitions that are needed in this paper. In Section 3, we present the proce- dures of the proposed method based on fuzzy SAW, IT2 FS and fuzzy ranking method. The proposed method is then applied to the case study for evaluating ambulance location preference. The implementation of this application is presented in Section 4. Sec- tion 5 concludes.

Preliminaries

This section introduces the elementary definitions and concepts of type-2 fuzzy set theory and fuzzy ranking method.

Definition 1 [26]. A type-2 fuzzy set A in the universe of discourse
X is characterized by a type-2 membership function l (x; u) where
A = {((x; u); lA (x; u))|6x ∈ X; 6u ∈ Jx };	(1)
x ∈ X; u ∈ Jx ; Jx  represents  the  main  membership  of  x; Jx ∈ [0; 1]; l (x; u) represents the secondary grade of (x; u) and

fuzzy sets (T1 FS). Most of the existing FSAW methods are built from linguistic terms based on T1 FS. In reality, some decision might not be given as an exact relative crisp scale. The linguistic interval scales are used instead. The authors decide to use interval type-2 fuzzy sets (IT2 FS) scale for expressing linguistic evaluation due to the fact that the IT2 FS provides more flexibility to present uncertainties than T1 FS. Furthermore, IT2 FS can be used as an indicator of uncertainty where the larger length of the interval may capture more room of uncertainty that happened during the process of information gathering from the decision makers [24].
In this paper, the authors are motivated with the advantages of
where x ∈ X; u ∈ Jx ; Jx C [0; 1] and	represents the unification over
all admissible x and u. A type-2 membership function is three- dimensional and the third dimension (i.e., l (x; u)) which offers a
degree of freedom in managing uncertainties.


Definition 2 [26]. Let A be a type-2 fuzzy set in the universe of discourse X denoted by the type-2 membership function l . If all
the secondary grades lA (x; u) of A are equal to 1, then A is called an interval type-2 fuzzy set. It symbolically shown as:

The proposed method

The fuzzy simple additive weighting (FSAW) was introduced to handle uncertainty in linguistic judgment [29–32], where fuzzy numbers are employed instead of the crisp numbers. In evaluation processes of decision making, the fuzzy set theory is germane to subjective judgment and quantitative assessment compared to classical evaluation method which is applying crisp values [33,34]. The FSAW utilizes trapezoidal fuzzy numbers to show
any fuzziness in scores and weights. Unlike FSAW, the interval

type-2 trapezoidal fuzzy numbers are utilized in the proposed method. The proposed method encompasses three stages. In the first stage, the evaluations of alternatives with respect to criteria

Application to ambulance location preference

A committee of four experts has been identified and was invited to provide a qualitative evaluation using linguistic variables per- taining to EMS. The experts were interviewed in four different ses- sions in order to tap their evaluation regarding the preference of ambulance deployment with respect to the criteria in EMS. The lin- guistic evaluation is truly practical, especially in the presence of
qualitative criteria [18]. The experts in this case are a medical offi-

Study [13] used government buildings and petrol sta- tions as their landmarks in order to determine the strategic loca- tion for mobile ambulance. Studies [37,38] investigated the location of the ambulance cases along the highway with the pur- pose to reduce the mean user response time and the inequality of the ambulance workloads. The hierarchy structure of the deci- sion making problem is depicted in Fig. 3.
The proposed IT2 FSAW method to determine the best ambu- lance location is composed in the following steps.

Step 1: A team of experts comprises three medical officers (D1,
D , D ) and an emergency department officer (D ) were asked to

evaluate the alternative for ambulance location preference. The experts utilized the linguistic terms in Table 2 to rate the alter- natives with admiration to each criterion. The linguistic vari- ables are presented as IT2 FS.

Based on the linguistic terms in Table 3, the experts also provide fuzzy ratings of alternatives with respect to each subjective criterion. Table 4 shows the ratings of alternatives with respect to indi-
vidual subjective criteria evaluated by four experts.
Weights of the criteria evaluated by the expert team can be seen in Table 5.

Step 2: By using the information in Table 4, and the formulation in Eq. (9), the decision matrices Y1, Y2, Y 3 and Y 4 for the alter- natives A1, A2, A3, A4 and A5 are obtained.

The limitation of T1 FS saw the preference order obtained using FSAW method is slightly inconsistent with the result obtained using the proposed method. As IT2 FSAW, the IT2-FTOPSIS also used the similar IT2 FS, but they differ in weight determination for each criterion. This might explain the small inconsistency in preference orders among the three methods.

Locating ambulance is one of the most important issues in the emergency management. Due to rapid growth of population, many researchers initiate work to identify the most strategic location in deploying ambulances, which in return, can benefit the residents. Hence, ambulance services are urged to seek and recognize the suit- able and strategic location for the benefit of people. At the same time, the services also may minimize the loss of precious life. A good ambulance location can guarantee the arrival of an ambulance to the emergency call scene within a defined time threshold. Because of time pressure, lack of experience and personality, experts often eval- uate the criteria and alternatives in the case of ambulance location using the linguistic variable. In this paper, we have proposed an interval type-2 fuzzy simple additive weighting to evaluate ambu-

Ranking values Rank( A i) and ranking of alternatives can be obtained using Eq. (18), Eq. (19) and Eq. (20). It is shown in Table 6.
According  to  the  framework  of  IT2  FSAW,  Rank( A 1) >
Rank( A 4) > Rank( A 3) > Rank( A 2) > Rank( A 5), the preference order of the alternatives A1, A2, A3, A4 and A5 is A1 > A4 > A3 > A2 > A5, where the symbol ‘‘>” means superior to. The road network A1
(0.3896), represents slightly higher than other alternatives. There- fore, the A1 is the best ambulance location for deployment of an ambulance. The order of the rest alternatives is public clinic, parking lot, petrol station and highway. This preference order is obtained from the implementation of the proposed method with the linguistic data. It is better to have a comparable analysis as to check the
lance location selection. The linguistic scale of interval type-2 fuzzy set was used contrary to crisp numbers and type-1 fuzzy numbers to express the experts’ evaluation for alternatives with respect to crite- ria and the weights of each criterion. The use of interval type-2 fuzzy sets makes the decision process considerably more practical. Fuzzy simple additive weighting was employed to compute the weights of criteria and fuzzy ranking method was adopted to rank the alter- natives of strategic ambulance location. The proposed method has the ability to capture the vagueness of human thinking style and effectively solved multi-criteria decision making problems of ambu- lance location selection. Particularly, it provides emergency depart- ments with a flexible manner to evaluate the strategic area for locating ambulance under fuzzy environments. It was consensual



agreed on road networks as the most influential alternative in ambu- lance location selection. Perhaps a reliable validating mechanism, such as sensitivity analysis could be introduced to investigate the stability of the suggested method. The implementation of the sug- gested method to other real applications is still open for further investigation.
