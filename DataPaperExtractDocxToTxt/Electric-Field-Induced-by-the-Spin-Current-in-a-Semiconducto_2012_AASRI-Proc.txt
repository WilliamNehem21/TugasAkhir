Abstract

Using a new spin current definition the spin current and spin-current-induced electric field in a weak semiconductor Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling nanowire (quantum wire) have been investigated theoretically. It is found that two nonzero linear spin current density elements take on oscillation peaks at the center of nanowire and their strengths can be changed by the number of propagation modes and Dresselhaus constant, respectively. Moreover, the spin-current-induced electric field has been calculated and its strength is measurable with today’s technology which can be used to spin current detection. Our consequences also show that the strengths of spin current and spin-current-induced electric field for the Dresselhaus case are smaller than that for the Rashba case.

Introduction

The intrinsic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effect in semiconductors has attracted intensive attentions for its important role in semiconductor spintronics.[1, 2] There are two types of intrinsic SOC in semiconductor heterojunction two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG), namely Rashba SOC (RSOC) and Dresselhaus SOC (DSOC).[3, 4] In the situation of SOC, a moving spin is under an equivalent magnetic field with its strength depending on momentum of the particle. Similar to a system with an external magnetic field, it is natural to ask whether a persistent current exists in a SOC system.

Spin current in the ballistic systems has been investigated in several years.[4-12] However, there still exists a lot of debates over the correct definition of spin current.[4, 6, 9, 10] Rashba first suggested that the
conventional definition IS=Re vˆsˆ should be modified to eliminate the nonzero spin current.[4] After Rashba’s work, Sun et al. bring forward a new definition by using the conventional (linear) spin current and a
angular spin current describing the spin motion and rotation, and further they also discussed the reasonableness of this definition in details.[5, 7-11] In the following, we will use the definition studying spin current and spin-current-induced electric field in a weak Dresselhaus nanowire (quantum wire), and all nonzero spin current density elements are calculated and demonstrated analytically.

Model and formalism

The geometry model of quantum wire is shown in Fig.1 and its effective mass single electron Hamiltonian is [13]

In the above Hamiltonian, the hard-wall confining potential is V(x)=0 for |x|<d/2 and ∞ for |x|>d/2 with d

After substituting the electron wave-function Ψ (x,y) into Eq.(7), the linear and angular spin current density can be obtained straightforwardly. There are four nonzero linear spin current density elements

From Eqs.(5) and (6) one can find four different occupied states for the nth mode, k+ Ė, k+ ↓, k- Ė, k- ↓, are in relation to the spin-up and spin-down states with electron propagating along +y and –y direction, respectively, and in the equilibrium these states have the relation k+ Ė+ k+ ↓+ k- Ė+ k- ↓=0 due to same contributions.[7, 10] Then the linear and angular spin current density elements for the nth mode which including ky can be obtained as

Results and discussion

In the following, the numerical examples of nonzero linear spin current density elements and spin-current- induced electric field will be presented. The electron effective mass is taken as that for InGaAs quantum well m*=0.037me and the Dresselhaus constant β D=1.0×10-12 eVm, moreover, the Bohr magneton μ B=9.274× 10-24 A.m2 and the factor g=2. In the situation of hard-wall potential confining, it is assumed that the QW is elongated with a fixed area s=Ld and then the number of propagation modes (that is, the width of QW) will be decreased accordingly.[17] The initial length and width of QW are taken as L0=300 nm and d0=240 nm while the incident electron energies EĖ↓=Ef=5.9 meV. For one mode to four modes case the width d is taken as 80
nm, 120 nm, 160 nm and 200 nm accordingly.

it is the spin current density flowing along the confined x direction with the spin pointing to the transverse x
direction. The existence of this elemK ent Kis due to spin precession in accompany with the electron motion.[7]
From Eq.(15) the direction of ET ( Eω =0) can be known in the y-z plane and its strength can be expressed
as ET =	. In Fig.3 (a)-(d), the contour patterns of ET for one mode to four modes case are shown as
functions of u and z. One can find that ET mainly distributes at the nearby area of QW along the z direction and the area expands accordingly with the increasing of propagation modes. Furthermore, our results find that the spin-current-induced electric field for the Dresselhaus case is smaller than it for the Rashba case, moreover


one can find when the number of propagation modes increases the strength of ET decrease rapidly indicating that the DSOC has a less influence than the RSOC to the ET.

constant case with three modes in the QW.

In Fig.4 the influences of Dresselhaus constant β D on jT , jT and E for three modes case are demonstrated. It should be pointed out that in some 2DEG systems, the DSOC can lead to linear k-splitting and its strength increases with the decrease of thickness,[18] therefore, it would become comparable with the
RSOC.[19] From the figures whenβ D increases from 1.0×10-12 eVm to 2.0×10-12 eVm, the altitudes of jT	,

T
s,yy
and ET
increase for twice accordingly and a linear increasing relation withβ
D exists. Furthermore, from

Fig.4 (c) and (d) for the case of β D =2.0×10-12 eVm (dashed line), ET can reach ~10-5 V/m which is as much as that of mesoscopic semiconducting ring in Ref.10. Moreover, in Fig.4 (c) the electric potential difference between two points (60 nm, 200 nm, 2 nm) and (60 nm, 200 nm, 50 nm) forβ D =2.0×10-12 eVm can be calculated as about 0.289 nV which is also smaller than it for the RSOC case. However, this potential value is still measurable with today’s technology [20] indicating that the spin-current-induced electric field can be detected which provide a way of spin current detection for the DSOC instance.

Conclusion

In this paper, we have studied the spin current and spin-current-induced electric field in a Dresselhaus nanowire (quantum wire). Using the electron wave-functions and definition of spin current, the linear and angular spin current densities and its induced electric fields have been calculated. It is found that two nonzero linear spin current density elements have peaks at the center of nanowire and their strengths can be changed by the number of propagation modes and Dresselhaus constant. Moreover, for the Dresselhaus QW instance the spin-current-induced electric field can also be detected which makes a way of spin current detection.
