Year after year, traffic problems are increasing rapidly due to rapid urban development and increasing car ownership. Traffic congestion, traffic violations, stealing cars, and fugitive criminals impose big chal- lenges on traffic management systems. Several systems are developed to solve these problems such as self-driving systems [1], Traffic surveillance systems [2,3], Tracking vehicle systems and Vehicle speed detection systems [4,5]. License plate detection and character recognition (LPDR) is one of the most important topics in intelligent infrastructure systems, like electronic payment systems (for tolls, parking, and public trans- portation). The LPDR system is an image processing technology used to identify vehicles using their license plate to help the traffic management department for monitoring purposes. Usually, a license plate detection and character recognition (LPDR) system has mainly three phases. The first phase is image pre-processing, once the image is captured further processing of the image is carried out like converting the image from a color space to another, resizing the image resolution, and removing noises. The second phase is license plate localization, the region of in- terest is detected based on some license plate characteristics and image features. The final phase is the optical character recognition, this phase is considered the most crucial step because it helps to read the plate number and identify the vehicle.

Although there is a lot of research on the license plate detection and recognition, most of the proposed methods have some restrictions and perform well only under certain predefined conditions. Some common restrictions include illumination problems, complex scenes and the presence of blur or distortions on the license plate. Moreover, the toughness of this task resides in the huge variety of characters shapes, like different fonts, forms sizes and colors of each character through the different license plates in each country.

The goal of this paper is to establish a low-cost, highly efficient automatic vehicle license plate detection and recognition system. The idea presented in this paper is divided into two stages: license plate localization and character recognition. In the first stage, the license plate regions are extracted from the input image. The potential license plates are extracted based on vertical edges where the high density of these edges is inside the LP. To extract the vertical edges from the input image, we have used the two-dimensional wavelet decomposition (2D-WD). The 2D-WD divides the image into four sub-bands where the vertical edges are in one of these sub-bands. After getting the vertical edges, we extract the license plate candidates by looking for the high density of vertical edges. Finally, to verify the correctness of these candidates, a plate/non- plate CNN classifier is trained to remove the false positive. In the second stage, the separating columns between the characters are extracted to segment the license plate characters and to generate the segmented candidates. Finally, these character candidates are classified by training another CNN classifier.

License plate detection is a very important step in the proposed method, where its efficiency plays a big role in the detection and recognition of license plate characters. The principle of this step is to look for the potential license plate locations in the input image (zones of in- terest) then verify these locations as a license plate or not. In our prop- osition, we have based on vertical edges to detect the potential license plate candidates. First, the 2D-WD is used to extract the vertical edges. Then, the high density of the vertical edges is calculated to detect the potential license plate candidates. These candidates are then classified by training a plate/non-plate CNN classifier to remove the false positive.

To extract the high vertical edge density areas, we have based on calculating the maximum entropy areas. The entropy is a measure of disorder or randomness of a system, it measures the degree of disorder or uncertainty associated with a random variable. Therefore, the area where the entropy is maximum returns to the areas where there is a high vertical edge density. Entropy is usually calculated from an image using Shannon entropy, where the probability distribution could be easily estimated from image histogram [19]. The entropy formula is given as follows (1):

Unfortunately, in the binary image, we find some noisy holes and some broken areas where the region of interest might be divided into two regions. To solve this problem, a morphological operation is used. The closing operation (dilation followed by erosion) is performed to recover these holes.

After the localization, the license plates are cropped from their orig- inal image and classified. Then they go through the recognition process for classifying and recognizing their letters and numbers. Where the principle of this step is to look for the characters candidates in the detected license plate then match them with the characters. In the pro- posed method, the empty lines between the characters are detected to segment the license plate characters and generate the segmented candi- dates. Then, these segmented candidates are classified by training CNN classifier to recognize the license plate characters.

For the classification, we have used a pre-trained CNN model, so that we do not need a large training dataset for successful classification. For license plate detection, the first CNN model was re-trained using 200 license plate images and 200 non-license plate images that were cropped by ourselves from Caltech [21] and AOLP [22] datasets. For license plate recognition, about 600 images of cropped characters from the Caltech and AOLP datasets and some images of Arabic letters taken from images of Moroccan cars, as well as about 600 samples of non-characters from different scenes under different conditions, are used to re-train the sec- ond CNN model.

For license plate detection, the performance has been evaluated using three methods to compare our work with. Rashedi et al. [13] have been detecting the license plate based on combining four methods, the Contrast-based method, Color-based method, Edge-based method, and a method uses cascade classifiers and local binary pattern (LBP). Yuan et al.

reduce the processing time. Unlike other methods, they rely only on binarization to extract features. Besides, the use of the entropy function helps a lot to detect potential regions more than the other proven algo- rithm. This combination of useful algorithms reduces the error rate and improves the generated true candidates. Also, the classification of these generated candidates using CNN classifier is one of the main reasons that improved accuracy.
