As an interesting exploration on the above issue, Z. Xia, the first author of this paper, designed a interactive student network for a group of twelve students in Suzhou No.3 High School (see the fol- lowing 1.4). Students, who use the interactive student network, can send and receive information each other. This network created a new environment for these students and would promote the interaction among these students. We state the concept of interac- tive student network as follows, which is similar to wireless net- work system in [9].

to B1. Also, since u2 and B1 have a contact, B1 can send information to u2. Thus, P1 can send information to u2. Successively, P1 can send information to un = v. Moreover, with the help of v = un; P2 can

To investigate the above question, it is necessary to analyze data collected from interactive student networks. In the research of modern sciences, in order to extract useful information hidden in data, many methods in addition to classical logic and classical mathematics have been proposed. Rough set theory, which was proposed by Pawlak [15], plays an important role in applications of these methods. Their usefulness has been demonstrated by many successful applications in information sciences and com- puter sciences [2,4,12,18,21,22]. In particular, rough set theory is

Remark 5.2. This paper focuses on check of completeness of inter- active student networks, without dealing with the method of establishing them. How do we establish a complete interactive stu- dent network? This is an interesting question, which deals with either mobile communication project or virtual organization framework. We will discuss this question in our future work.
