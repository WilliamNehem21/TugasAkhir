In order to obtain accurate solution for large-scale optimization problems, exact optimization algorithms are not efficient enough to provide an appropriate solution with a high-dimensional search space. Therefore, to overcome these limitations, new optimization technics have been developed, most of them based on a metaphor of some natural or man-made process. The main goal is to find a good feasible solution that is at least reasonably close to being optimal.

However, these algorithms suffer from a major shortcoming, i.e. being trapped in local minima. In order to overcome these limitations, many other optimization technics have been developed. Some of these technics are Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) [10], Cuckoo Optimization Algorithm (COA) [11].

This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a brief review of hurricanes as a meteorological phenomenon and the concepts and ideas behind HOA in details. In Section 3 the experimental results are demonstrated. Finally, conclusions are given in Section 4.

In HOA, wind parcels start spiraling outward from the eye. The velocities are controlled by a predefined model. In this process, wind parcels search for a lower pressure zone (new eye position). Once new lower pressure is discovered, its position becomes the eye and the process starts all over again.

To prove its performance, HOA is tested with several benchmark functions with different dimensions. The statistical results show the effectiveness of the proposed method in solving various nonlinear functions. In further work, HOA should be compared to other metaheuristic optimization algorithms.
