When working with knowledge it is linked to the mental processes of the human mind. These processes are very complex and sophisticated, that is, they are automatically uncertain and have a large variability of potential solutions. This complicates any computer support related to the processing of data, information and knowledge. There are many, however, just single purpose approaches for the processing of knowledge or mining techniques, although an universal approach or software application is still missing.
