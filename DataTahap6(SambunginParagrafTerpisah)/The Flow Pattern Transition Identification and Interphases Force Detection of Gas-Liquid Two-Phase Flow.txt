the resistance has no effects on the signal and the gravity differential pressure has a directly relation with the phase holdup. Therefore, the method for the pattern transition has a universal applicability. The characteristic parameters of the gravity differential pressure signal, which is based on the wavelet analysis, can reflect the related information from the stratified flow to annular flow, and combined with interphases force to analyze the motivation of flow pattern transition. The work will provide a new method to reveal the gas-liquid two-phase flow motivation management.

The gravity differential pressure fluctuation signal perpendicular to the horizontal flow is not only related to the phase holdup, but also can reflect the interphases force. By extracting the characteristic quantities, it is proved that the wavelet energy is sensitive to the transition from the laminar flow to the annular flow; besides, by the analysis of the variation the characteristic parameters change with the flow parameters, combining with interphases force to analyze the motivation of flow pattern transition. It is simple, convenient, safe and accurate to obtain the gravity differential pressure fluctuation signal whose characteristics change significantly as the flow pattern changes. This is a new method for the identification of gas-liquid two-phase flow pattern.
