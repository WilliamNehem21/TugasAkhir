full use of the function between float displacement and inductor, and the function between inductor and measured flow, measures inductor instead of flow rate, and fulfils the non-electrify electrometric. By converting the float displacement measurement for the inductor measurement after a series of circuit which is connected with the inductance sensor, and corresponding to the flow rate through the MSP430 processing, it finally accomplishes the functions of displaying the flow rate in scene and remote transmitting [1]. It also accomplishes the digital and intelligent measurement.

The rectifier circuit which makes full use of the rectifier components with unipolar conductivity rectifies the positive and negative alternating sine wave AC voltage to the pulse voltage in signal direction [5]. However, the unidirectional pulsating voltage tends to have great pulsating components, far from the ideal. The filter, composed of capacitors, inductances and other energy storage devices, can remove the pulse elements as much as possible, so that the output voltage can be relatively smooth.
