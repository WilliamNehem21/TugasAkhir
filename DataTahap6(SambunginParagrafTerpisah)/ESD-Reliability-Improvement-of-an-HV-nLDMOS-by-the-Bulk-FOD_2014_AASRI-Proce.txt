This paper proposed an HV nLDMOS device with FODs structures in the bulk side to observe ESD reliability. With the FOD structure in the bulk region can effectively enhance the anti-ESD ability of these 60- V nLDMOS devices. The It2 average value can be improved about 1.12% ~ >111.74% as compared with the reference group value. Moreover, we should also pay attention to the trigger voltage of a DUT might not be too small and less than the operation voltage 60-V as with increasing FOD structure occupied area. Therefore, with these FODs adding in the bulk region can extremely effective enhance the ESD ability; however, we should take care about the maximum FODs area limitation.
