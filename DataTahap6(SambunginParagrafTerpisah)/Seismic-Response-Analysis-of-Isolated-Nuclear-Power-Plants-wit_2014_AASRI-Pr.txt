In this paper, a new friction damper isolation system (FDIS) is suggested for isolated nuclear power plants (NPPs). Seismic responses of NPPs are accomplished by means of the finite element approach and setting up a representative multi-particle model of NPPs. Results in terms of time domain analysis show that response of structure supported by FDIS under small seismic are correspond to fixed structure, and perform similar properties as conventional isolated structure under large seismic. The yield force of friction damper is one of the important parameters which are related to responses and absorbing energy under seismic input energy in new isolated structures. Compared with cases of different yield level, responses of superstructures increase respectively with yield force, while displacements of isolation layer decrease effectively. The proposed new isolation system could be beneficial in enhancing the seismic safety of isolated NPPs.

As a kind of critical industrial buildings, any damage of Nuclear power plants structures will lead to severe disasters. Different from conventional NPPs design, seismic isolation is considered to be the most promising technology to protect nuclear reactors from violent earthquake. Several studies performed in Japan have shown that it would not be possible to design large plants which are economical in areas of high seismicity without incorporating seismic isolation [3]. In spite of this, only two of nuclear power plants in commercial operation are protected by isolation until now: 4 PWRs (Pressurized Water Reactors) at Cruas in France and 2 PWRs at Koeberg in South Africa [2].

Although, significant relative movements under small seismic between the isolated superstructure and ground can easily destroy the crucial service networks and pipelines crossing isolation layer. It is an important problem limit the usage of seismic isolation into nuclear power plant. In this paper, the friction damper isolation system (FDIS) is suggested in reducing seismic response of superstructure. A representative multi- particle model of nuclear power plant is introduced to study effects of the FDIS in reducing seismic response.

The friction damper isolation system is composed of friction damper and normal rubber bearing. Different from normal isolation system, superstructures supported by FDIS under small seismic are kept rigid connection as fixed by the friction damper with high yield force and large initial stiffness. In this case, the networks and pipelines work well under small seismic. With increase of loading level, friction damper start slide while the horizontal shear force of isolation layer reaches design yield force under violent seismic, and then dissipate earthquake energy. While friction damper sliding, the FDIS works as normal isolation system and seismic response of superstructure is reduced effectively. In this case, destroy of pipelines crossing isolation layer has become insignificant damage with the crucial nuclear reactor is protected by isolation system. The FDIS overcomes the limit of normal isolation system, and keeps superstructure rigid connection with ground under design earthquake, which prevents the damage of crucial pipelines caused by large isolation layer displacement under small seismic.

In this paper, a new friction damper isolation system for NPPs is proposed. This novel isolation system effectively reduce large isolation displacement, which limits the use of isolation technology in NPPs. Results from FEM analysis are used to verify the effectiveness of this system and investigate the influence of friction damper on seismic responses of isolated NPPs. Some conclusions of significance can be drawn as follows:

The isolation layer displacement is well controlled by F. The maximum displacement value is, in general, decreasing with the increase in the yield force of FDIS. In case 12% with 0.05g earthquake input, isolation displacement is less than 5mm and the FDIS is still rigid.
