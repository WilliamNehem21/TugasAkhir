mechanisms, such as gear boxes, chains and screw coupling, allowing high precision control to be achieved. It is a trance that linear motors are widely used in high performance CNC machine tools [1]. The vector control system of permanent magnet synchronous linear motor doesn t have the advantage of high precision control and high dynamic performance, but also can change speed more conveniently, as a result, the system attract more and more scholars to pay attention home and abroad [2]. The experiment has built the model of vector control system of PMSLM based on the environment of MATLAB software, which can provide the design and work of actual system with a new measure.

In order to check whether the simulation model is valid or not, the simulation experiment was completed in Matlab7.1 Software. Because of the nonlinear component, the experiment select ode23td algorithm which is a variable step way, the relative error and absolute error is 0.001; the parameters of PMLSM are: phase resistance R = 3. 2   axis inductance Ld =8mH, q-axis inductance Lq = 8mH, the flux of permanent magnet

For AC servo control system, Rapidity, Accuracy and Stability are the main performance indexes to estimate whether it is efficient. The simulation result shows, when a speed command is given, the permanent magnet linear synchronous motors (PMLSM) can attain the given speed by adjusting the speed loop and current loop and the Rate response curves in time domain is more ideal. The speed loop simulation system can run smoothly and features excellent dynamic and static performances. The experiment fully illustrated and proved the correctness of PMLSM mathematical model and the feasibility of this control algorithm and it offered the thinking for the further designing and adjusting of direct drive system.
