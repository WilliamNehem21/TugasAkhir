Following the above outlined steps, a power farm has been designed and its size has been chosen in order to maximize the energy extraction in the waters of west Sicily. The data used to optimize the converter and the farm are some experimental data on the energy density of seawes on a point located on the north west part of Sicily in the middle of Mediterranean sea. The numerical results and optimization of this procedure is illustrated in this paper[1].

The converter were simulated by assuming a standard numerical model of the inverter. The parameters that we have considered is the ripple in dc link, the time of use of each inverter the continuity of the generation. The simulation was run many times and in each run each generator was exposed to a set of waveform generated as illustrated. Each generator had the characteristics of the one reported above.
