Kim and Park [12] have proposed a local adaptive thresh- olding based technique for the segmentation of carotid artery using MRA slices. This technique automatically computes the threshold value by considering a midpoint of maximum and minimum gray levels of only first slice. In addition, the application of the threshold value filters the first slice. Taking into account the anatomical structure of the left and right car- otid arteries, the filtered slice is divided into two subregions. Seed points of each subregion are calculated and their eight connecting neighbors are labeled in order to get the region of interest.

Priyadharshini and Anitha [14] applied region growing algorithm to diagnose glaucoma in eye. The pre-processing imaging technique and morphological operations such as dila- tion and erosion were incorporated and median filter was applied in the proposed technique. The technique shows per- formance improvement in terms of image quality and image edges compared to the thresholding techniques.

In this paper, we proposed few enhancements in region growing algorithm. Our main contribution is to determine appropriate threshold value of slice, seed point and starting slice number. We also developed a two pass algorithm for grayscale 8-connected neighbors. We applied all these compo- nents in RGA and evaluate the performance in terms of image enhancement. The region growing algorithm that applies in our proposed system is driven from [16].
