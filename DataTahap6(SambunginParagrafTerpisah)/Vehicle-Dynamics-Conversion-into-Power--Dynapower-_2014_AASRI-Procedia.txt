Even without wind, the vehicle movement generates forces that will make the blades rotate. The blades are mounted on the rotor coupled with the generator through a shaft in order to produce power. This electrical energy will charge the batteries or supply accessories [7].

Compared to other solutions, this system has two main advantages. First, when the devise is closed, the aerodynamics will not be affected. Then, the system can be acted on a downhill because the kinetic energy is more significant than on a flat road.

This part presents a new device to convert suspension motion into power. The contact ground-wheel induces a translation movement [11], [12]. This dynamics can be converted into electrical energy by adding a simple mechanism. We just need to transform translation movement to rotation one in order to produce power.
