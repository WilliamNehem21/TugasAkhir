A new decomposition method to calculate IMDCT is proposed in this paper. The decomposition algorithm can convert a pair of long transforms into 2 pairs of short transforms with half size of the long transforms. In addition, the decomposition algorithm can be utilized recursively to attain shorter transforms and reduce computational cycles. According to experimental results obtained previously, the number of computational cycles of 512-point IMDCT is estimated to be 9641, which is less than those in previous reports.

A new decomposition method to calculate IMDCT is proposed in this paper. The work presented in this paper results from the method in [5]. Its aim is to further develop the algorithm in [5] and increase the computational efficiency for IMDCT computation. The core idea is to recursively decompose a pair of long transforms into 2 pairs of short transforms with half size of the long transforms. The detailed derivation of algorithm is proposed in section II. Conclusion is presented in Section III.
