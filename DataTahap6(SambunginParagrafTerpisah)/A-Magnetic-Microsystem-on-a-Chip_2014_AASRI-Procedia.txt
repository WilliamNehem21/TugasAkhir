A magnetic microsystem has been designed on a chip to demonstrate the improved performance of an integrated Hall element. The major deficiencies of relatively poor performance of an integrated Hall element has been upgraded through the use of a high efficiency, integrated micro coil, which has been optimized using multiphysics finite element tools. An extensive characterization of the integrated Hall element has allowed the creation of the most complete simulation model, which is usable both in a high level system simulator as well as in a detailed circuit simulation. All results were verified by measuring the fabricated ASIC.

possible sensor types of magnetic field available for integration on a chip. There are: Hall-effect sensors, Hall elements near field micro coils, and large, integrated coils for AC field generation /3/. The Hall element and near field micro coil are investigated in the paper.

An important parameter is also the temperature coefficient of the Hall element sensitivity, which is highly non-linear and very process dependent. Unfortunately, the sensitivity is also dependent on the mechanical stress caused by the plastic package. There are few possibilities of converting such an inaccurate sensor element into a high precision sensor system. The most promising approach is an alive sensor sensitivity calibration using a near field micro coil.

The key function of near-field micro coil is to generate a relative strong reference magnetic field on board to be used for either online or offline Hall element sensitivity adjustment. The offline adjustment can be performed either at wafer sorting or final testing of the device by applying a reference current to the coil and measuring and trimming the Hall element response to the desired value. The application of this method is simple, however it does not cover the temperature effect of the sensitivity, nor the sensitivity variation due to package pressure effect.
