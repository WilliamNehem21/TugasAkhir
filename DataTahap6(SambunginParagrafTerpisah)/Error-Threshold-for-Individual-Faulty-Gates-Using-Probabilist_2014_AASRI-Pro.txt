Section 2 outlines Probabilistic Transfer Matrix (PTM). Section 3 exhibits the employment of PTM in deriving the exact error threshold for individual faulty gates. Extensive simulation results and discussion are shown in Section 4. The paper is concluded in Section 5.

Reliability is fast becoming a critical subject in the design entry of nanotechnology-based circuits. Due to this occurrence, various computational-based approaches have been proposed to assess reliability of these circuit systems. Apart from assessing reliability, in this paper we briefly present an analytical approach based on Probabilistic Transfer Matrix (PTM) on how to derive exact error thresholds for general probabilistic computation. Exact error thresholds for faulty gates are significantly important subject to be considered in the designing nano-based circuit systems as it provides the exact bounds above which no reliable calculation is achievable.
