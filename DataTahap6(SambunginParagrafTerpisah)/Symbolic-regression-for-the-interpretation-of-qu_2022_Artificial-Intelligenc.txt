Symbolic regression (SR) searches for the mathematical expressions that explain a training dataset. Roughly speaking, an SR expression con- sists of a combination of arithmetic operators or mathematical func- tions and terminals (variables and numerical constants). SR expressions do not rely on a fixed functional form, unlike the engineered features of MLR (multiplication/division). Thus, SR has the potential to repre- sent nonlinear QSARs/QSPRs as explicit expressions without any prior knowledge regarding the functional form of the expression. Because the search space of expressions is generally vast, and expressions can be nat-

This expression contains two arccos functions and two arctan func- tions. The number of aliphatic heterocycles (NAliHc) appears in several terms. Even the simplest expression is hard to interpret through a vi- sual inspection, notwithstanding that it completely fails to explain the training data. For the most complex expression, the R2 value for the training data set was 0.98, suggesting a good fit to the training data.
