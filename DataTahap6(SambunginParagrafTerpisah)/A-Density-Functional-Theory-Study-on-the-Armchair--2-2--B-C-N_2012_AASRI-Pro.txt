The cross sections of (2,2) B-C-N tubes were distorted. Tube larger diameter (DL) or smaller diameter (DS) of tube models denoted the largest or shortest distance of two atoms in a same cross section. The slightly distorted models were with the values of DL/DS being 1.070 for the models BC6N(II) but larger values of DL/DS being 1.212 for the models B4C2N2(II).

The default k point of wave vector was adopted in this work.  point was the centre of the first Brillouin zone and  point to X point was a half of Brillouin zone. It was found the models of B2C4N2(I), B4C2N2, B3C2N3(I) and B3C2N3 (III) have direct band gaps where the maximum of valence bands (occupied bands described by solids curves) and the minimum of conduction bands (unoccupied bands described by dashed curves) being in a same k point. For the rest models, the band gaps show indirect gaps where the maximum of valence band and the minimum of conduction band being in different k point. The maximum of direct band gaps for the most of models were at X point besides of the models of B2C4N2 and C2B3N3(II).

We have found (2,2) carbon nanotube[8] showing semiconductor whereas BN-NTs[10] being isolator. It was interesting that the energy gap values of (2,2) B-C-N nanotubes were within 0.062 to 3.874 eV showing metal, semiconductor or insulator conductivity. However, the band structure values or types depending on both the atom ratios and the types of atom arrangement. It was found the B4C2N2 showed the strongest metallic with the structure having two adjacent B atoms. The models [BC6N(I), B2C4N2(I) and B3C2N3(I)] containing the alternant straight -C-C-C-C and -B-N-B-N- strain were typical semiconductor conductivity whereas BC6N(II), B2C4N2(II) and B3C2N3 (II) had larger gap.

The ultra long model of single walled armchair (2,2) B-C-N nanotubes with different ratios of B, C and N atoms were studied with density functional theory of B3LYP/3-21G*. The (2,2) B-C-N nanotubes have serrated tubular structures. The band gaps of tubes were within 0.062 to 3.874 eV showing metal, semiconductor or insulator conductivity, which depend on both the atom ratios and the types of atoms arrangement.
