The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the SSL/TLS protocol, discusses MITM attacks on SSL/TLS-enabled application, and outlines existing solutions for MITM threats on SSL/TLS-enabled transactions. Section 3 presents the proposed solution for securing SSL/TLS-enabled application from MITM attacks. Section 4 analyzes the proposed solution and compares the pro- posed solution with related approaches. We conclude the paper in Section 5.

OTP manual (e.g. Scratch card): A piece of paper or card containing OTP. The OTP must be securely printed and mailed to the customer. Using the OTP the user can login to the system and after that the OTP has no value. In other words, the adversary cannot do anything by knowing the OTP once it is used, as the user is going to use a different OTP for the next time.
