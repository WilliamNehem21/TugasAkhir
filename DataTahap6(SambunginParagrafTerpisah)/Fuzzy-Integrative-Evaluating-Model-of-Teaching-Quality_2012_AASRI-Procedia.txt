The appropriate estimation method plays a significant role in different kinds of teaching process. In order to overcome the disadvantages of the conventional teaching estimation methods, an integrative evaluating model, which is based on the fuzzy logic, is proposed to deal with the evaluating process with multiple variables in this paper. The design process of constructing the model based on the fuzzy logic is discussed in detail. A satisfactory estimating result has been obtained on the basis of the practical data. The evaluating effect shows that the fuzzy estimating model is effective in processing the multi-variable plant.

Fuzzy logic was first proposed by Prof. L. A. Zadeh of the University of California at Berkeley in 1965. After that, the fuzzy controller was first implemented by Mamdani on a steam engine in 1974 [1, 2]. In the following years, fuzzy logic has come into wide uses in many successful applications and has obtained significant achievements.

The evaluation of the teaching quality is very important for a particular teacher, which is a typical multi- variable process, and there are lots of evaluation methods in the practical application. In this paper, a fuzzy integrative estimating model is proposed to get a reasonable evaluation result so as to overcome the disadvantages of the common estimating methods. By means of selecting the sum-product method to compute the eigenvector of every evaluation index, a proper estimating result has been obtained according to the fuzzy estimating model and the corresponding standardization procedure, which is on the basis of the practical application data. The overall results show that the fuzzy estimating model is quite effective for the multi- variable process.
