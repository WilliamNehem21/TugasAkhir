Falls are important public health problems. The damage they cause and the treatment expenditure for this both depend on the length of the aid response time[1]. Quick and effective ways of getting the information of the people falling to the ground can help the person get timely assistance to reduce further injury.

The image segmentation part adopts the background subtraction method, which does difference between current image and background model, and then with the help of the threshold, it should be made clear what pixels in difference image are of the type of background pixels and what pixels are of the type of foreground pixels to lock the target area. After extracting foreground pixels, use the shadow suppression method proposed by Elgammal to suppress the shadow[6]. The foreground image still has some small holes and noise, mathematical morphology expansion and corrosion operators have to be adopted to deal with this problem[7]. Finally, we get binary movement image after using a threshold.

When a person does some exercises, the aspect ratio may be bigger than 1. Judging the condition of a person by only using the aspect ratio condition will produce misjudgment. In this case, the minimum circumscribed rectangle box will become bigger, and the effective area ratio of the person will become smaller correspondingly. So, according to this feature, combined with the aspect ratio with effective area ratio, misjudgment can be avoided effectively.
