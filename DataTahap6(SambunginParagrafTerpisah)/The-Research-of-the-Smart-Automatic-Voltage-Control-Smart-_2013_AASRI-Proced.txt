state of the smart grid could be partitioned first and the nature of the work that it can be divided into a very fragile area, fault disturbance area and repair and maintenance area when the running state is abnormal. After performing workspace, three non-normal zone can be controlled respectively, and ultimately ensure the grid to optimize the control grid of run in the normal zone. So the grid realizes the optimization run, and optimize the allocation of grid resources. In this way, the power grid operation can be divided into the following five areas: optimized operation zone, routine operation zone, abnormal and vulnerable zone, contingency and fault zone and repair maintenance zone.

It is more interactive. It supports in the distribution network access to a large number of distributed power generation unit, energy storage, renewable energy, and the seamless connection to distribution network. And it supports micro-network operation, and increases the flexibility of the distribution network run and load reliability of supply.
