Similarly, for the thermal video, vision technique-based features were used in the thermodynamic modelling of the SMP foil. Feature points based multi-point temperature detection was applied to capture the thermodynamic nature of the SMP while heated by a constant current. Temperature readings based on position of the extracted feature points gave an overall distribution of thermodynamic changes along the SMP body during heating. This was an unconventional approach to derive

On the other hand, temperature readings of those key feature points were used as distributed thermodynamic profile across the foil structure to be used for training a model. For this phase of modelling, a simple BRR was used. Training input of this model was the multi-point temperature profile of the SMP foil, whereas training target was the set of polynomials that were captured during the video analysis.

RD, DR, CC and DL conceived the idea, did experimentation and machine learning modelling. They also contributed to the writing of the manuscript.
