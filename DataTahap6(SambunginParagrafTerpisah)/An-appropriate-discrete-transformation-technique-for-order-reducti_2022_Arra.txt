validation of the obtained results through step responses of the higher- order and obtained reduced-order systems is in section 6 along with the computed errors. The limitation found during the findings of the outcome from this article is discussed in section 7. Finally, the key dif- ference between the two methods is offered in section 8 as conclusions with a possible future scope.

With time span and easy access of digital signals and systems, discrete-time systems gained their consideration over analogue systems for control and analysis. Since, the study and analysis of such systems of higher order in their raw form is uneasy; they also demand their order reduction for easy access. Order reduction techniques available in literature showcase the advancement of fewer order reduction tech- niques in continuous-time domain directly to the discrete-time domain, both for non-interval and interval systems. Such type of algorithms in- cludes Pade approximation, balanced truncation, direct truncation, ag- gregation. Apart from these, an algorithm like Routh approximation in the continuous-time domain is not applicable to discrete-time domain directly. A vast range of algorithms based on Routh approximation is consisted in Ref. [12]. This call for an appropriate discretization tech- nique of the discrete-time systems to continuous-time and vice-versa with an ease of computation. Precisely, the transformation modifies the discrete-time system to continuous-time system; order reduction methodology applied, and finally, an appropriate inverse transformation results in the desired reduced model in discrete-time domain.
