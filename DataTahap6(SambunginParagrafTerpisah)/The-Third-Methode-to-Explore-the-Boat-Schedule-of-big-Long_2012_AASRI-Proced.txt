In this paper we assumpt three groups of boats are supposed to launch each day, including, group 1 comprised of motorized boats of different durations, group 2 comprised of oar-powered rubber crafts of different durations and group 3 motorized boats of different durations. By following this schedule, no contact will take place. In this case, the carrying capacity of the river is 238, which means at least 238 campsites should be provided. Besides, the total visits in 6 months are 3163. In contrast, no one is more superior to the other. The former schedule will provide even spread of boat types in terms of propulsions; while the latter ensures the maximal visits to the river.

The final purpose is to work out a schedule to ensure the minimal contact between boats, the maximal visits and utilization of the campsites. By increasing the number of boats launched into the river or cutting down on the time of interval between two groups of boats, X becomes larger and the utilization of campsites becomes better. However, this will increase contact between boats; Likewise, by cutting on the number of boats launched into the river or lengthening the interval time, the contact can reach its minimum. That is to say, these two are interacted. And our final purpose is to work out a schedule which can minimize the negative influences between them two. To make the problem simple, we will give our considerations from two perspectives respectively and then optimize the schedule in consideration to the contact problem.The time for crafting starts at 6:40 am.

Suppose there are 180 days in six months. In the previous 161 days, the number of boats launched each day is the same, i.e. 19 boats per day. When it comes to the 162nd day, either oar-powered rubber crafts or motorized boats of 19-night are unavailable so the number of boats launched will be on decrease. And this will last until 175th day when no boat is allowed to set off.
