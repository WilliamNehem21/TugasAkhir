The FREEMED FM040 (BP) contains passive plates consisting of resistive conductive rubber gold coated sensors. The platform can work at a sampling rate up to 500 Hz, while its active area measures 40 cm x 40 cm. BP was controlled by proprietary software, FreeSTEP. This software, in combination with the platform, can perform several types of analysis and measurement, such as static and dynamic analysis, postural and stabilometric analysis, and biomechanical analysis (gait analysis).

We choose this outcome because it is known to be a reliable and valid measure of standing balance control (Salavati et al., 2009). Moreover, considering the predetermined period of trials, total CoP path length resulted analogous to average CoP velocity (path length/ period) (Clark et al., 2010).

In this work we addressed the validity of Wii Balance Board to evaluate balance level typically assessed by means of baropodometer platform. In order to fulfill our purposes, we compared results obtained in two balance tests: balance standing with open and closed eyes. Variable chosen for the comparison was total CoP path length. TPL represents a reliable and valid measure of standing balance (Salavati et al., 2009).
