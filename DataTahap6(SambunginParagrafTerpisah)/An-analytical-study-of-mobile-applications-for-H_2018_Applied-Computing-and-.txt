[30] to identify and accumulate evidence regarding automated testing of mobile applications. Usability is measured in terms of three attributes, namely, effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction; as such, other attributes, such as cognitive load, may be disre- garded. To address the limitations of existing usability models when applied to mobile devices, Rachel et al [31] proposed a usability model, namely, people at the center of mobile application development.

Scholars also reviewed mobile applications for a specific field. Various mobile applications have been developed for health ser- vices, such as cardiology [24], heart failure symptoms [25], and diabetes [35]. Another study conducted by Boudreaux et al [29] where seven strategies for evaluating and selecting health- related applications are proposed.

The second part presents a case study for ten apps selected according to particular criteria. A questionnaire based on mobile app rating scale [16] evaluation criteria is prepared and sent to a number of contributors. The contributors who participated in this study have different experiences, backgrounds, and educational levels, thus enriching this evaluation study. Then, the question- naire data are collected to perform a statistical analysis. Finally, the achieved results are reported.
