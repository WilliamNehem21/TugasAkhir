phenotypes and how specific it is when describing a pathology. The func- tion also provides scatter and dimension reduction plots to analyse the clusters and features in the data. An additional output is a model report summarising the cluster assignments which can be used in other mod- elling analyses. This information can be used to compare association and network size influences for different clusters and gene expression patterns.

Additional functionalities of the package create an analytical envi- ronment to summarise gene functional classes or infer what cellular compartments are typically associated with the gene/protein. Such as- sessments in the context of expression changes or disease association can highlight emerging patterns in specific cellular states under the investi- gation. A specially designed function to extract gene pattern profiles can aid in a further refinement of causal gene networks when considering a specific phenotype or a condition.
