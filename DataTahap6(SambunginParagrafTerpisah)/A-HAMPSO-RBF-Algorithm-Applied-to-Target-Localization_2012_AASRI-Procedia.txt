This paper proposed a radial basis function neural network optimization algorithm with a hybrid adaptive mutation particle swarm. During the optimization of RBF neural networks, the HAMPSO method is adopted to train the network structure and applied to solve the problems of the target localization. The HAMPSO algorithm is a dynamically adaptive optimization approach using uniform distribution mutation and Gaussian distribution mutation to escape local optima. We propose a HAMPSO method that can expedite convergence toward the global optimum during the iterations. In order to verify that the proposed HAMPSO-RBF approach has effect, comparisons with the RBF, genetic algorithm based RBF and PSO-based RBF approach are made. The computational results proved that the proposed HAMPSO-RBF approach exhibits much better and faster convergence performance in the training process as well as better prediction ability in the validation process than the results of other three approaches.

The literature demonstrated that the target position can be effectively obtained using RBFNNs [2]. However, optimizing the structure of RBFNNs is still a challenging work. This paper proposed a RBFNNs optimization algorithm by HAMPSO and applied to target localization. The feasibility and efficiency of the algorithm over the PSO-RBFNNs and the GA-RBFNNs is demonstrated in the computational results.

A prediction of the RBF neural network for target localization was presented by using the HAMPSO method. In the proposed method, the HAMPSO technique is used to optimize the RBF neural network parameters. The computational results indicate that the proposed method is more efficient than RBF, GA-RBF and PSO-RBF methods. The proposed HAMPSO-RBF method can be further extended to the application in other scientific fields.
