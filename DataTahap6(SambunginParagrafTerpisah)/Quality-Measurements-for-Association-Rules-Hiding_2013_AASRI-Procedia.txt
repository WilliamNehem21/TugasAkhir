Data mining technologies are widely used and help people to make good decision and good money since appeared. While at the same time, some knowledge extracted from the data mining can be considered sensitive which may potentially reveal sensitive secrets and cause serious privacy problems [1-3]. This problem is dealt with privacy preserving data mining.

Privacy preserving data mining is a novel research direction in data mining. It analyzes the side effects incurring in data privacy. Privacy preserving data mining hides sensitive knowledge by modifying the original database in a way that sensitive knowledge disappeared with less affecting on non-sensitive knowledge.

The goal of association rule hiding is to construct a new, sanitized database D-sanitized from D-original, which makes R-sensitive  R-sanitized=, where R-sanitized is the set of all the association rules on D- sanitized at the same pre-defined minimum support threshold and minimum confidence threshold as  and  (or higher) , while less affecting the non-sensitive association rules , i.e., F-sanitized=R-original-R-sensitive.

The strategies are based on theorem 1. According to theorem 1, if association rule such as A  {i-left} {i- right} is hidden, then all the association rules such as A  {i-left} B  {i-right} (B) are hidden. To hide rules such as A  {i-left} {i-right} , it is needed to check the transactions contained {i-left, i-right} and increase the appearances of item i-left in the transactions to increase the support of the left hand or decrease the appearances of item i-right in the transactions to decrease the support of the right hand. The transformation of database is repeated until good quality measurements are arrived.
