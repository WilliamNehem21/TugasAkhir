The rest of the paper is organized as follows: section 2 presents the data preparation and pre-processing, tasks, section 3 provides a general overview of the SVM classification framework, section 4 reports results and compare them with the performances obtained by the previous results presented in Candelieri et al. 2013. Finally, some conclusions and planned future works are reported.

This paper reviews a previous decision support system for the assessment of structural health of the helicopter fuselage panels based on hierarchies of ANNs (Candelieri et al. 2013). Although that system proved to be sufficiently reliable, authors have investigated the potential benefits offered by the adoption of a SVM classification framework to perform two specific tasks of the diagnosis process, in particular the detection of a possible damage and the identification of the affected component (bay or stringer).
