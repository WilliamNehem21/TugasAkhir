examinations. From a practical point of view the authors try to extract patterns from the processed images to classify the existing cervix lesions with diagnostic purposes. The resulting attributes of the image processing were analysed using supervised classification techniques of data mining.

Current literature surveys show several works related to feature selection methods focused on search techniques, their applications in classification, comparisons, clustering, introduction of new methods, and combination thereof as indicated in [4], [5]. [6], and [8]. In other medical areas the work of Martin et al. [1] applied feature selection methods available in WEKA [2] to a database containing variables involved in the nutritional status of children aged 6 to 11 years. The purpose of that study was to specify which method determined the factors that contributed the most to nutritional assessment. In another study Blakrishnan [3] tried to find an optimal feature subset of the Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset using Symmetrical Uncertainty Attribute Evaluator and Fast Correlation-Based Filter. Guyon et al [7] studied the problem of selecting a small subset of genes from broad patterns of gene expression data recorded on DNA micro-arrays utilizing Support Vector Machine methods based on Recursive Feature Elimination. The studies just mentioned have the common goal of comparing the performance of attribute selection methods with the results obtained by learning algorithms and thus, determining which method significantly improves the results from different situations, with diversity of information, and high or low dimensionality.

The experiments with the sick class for the two types of images produced the best results, namely, the LADTree decision tree provided a 86.67% instances correctly classified in a S3 for Lugol's iodine images and the metaclassifier AdaBoostM1 and REPTree decision tree providing a 89.47% with a S9 for acetic acid images.
