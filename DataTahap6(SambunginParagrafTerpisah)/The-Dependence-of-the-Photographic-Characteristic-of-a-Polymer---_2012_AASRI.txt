To prepare both samples in the first stage it is necessary to disperse the zinc oxide into the polymer matrix. For this, 12 grams of zinc oxide (II) moistened with water was put into 100 ml of the 10% PVA water solution (which was homogenate on the bain-marie before it). After one hour of settling time, the 60 grams of the resulting mixture was coated on the glass plate with an area of 234 sq.cm. Then the composition was dried in a horizontal orientation at room temperature for 24 hours.

Next, the sensitizing of the compositions was made by using the salts of lead and bismuth by dipping the PVA-ZnO composition for the 30 seconds in 1 M bismuth chloride aqueous solution (to obtain the PVA-ZnO- BiCl3 photosensitive composition) or in the 0.1 M lead acetate aqueous solution (to obtain the PVA-ZnO- Pb(CH3COO)2 photosensitive composition). Finally, the photosensitive compositions are dried in a heated air flow for 5 minutes to eliminate moisture.

To achieve these aims, samples of the photosensitive compositions were exposed to the integrated spectrum light of a DRT-125 mercury-vapor lamp during various exposure times. The illumination on the sample surface was E=0.105 W/sq.cm., the optical blackening determination was carried out by the approved method using the author's hardware-software complex [3].

influence on the photosensitive composition sensitized by the bismuth chloride or by the lead acetate. So, for the PVA-ZnO-BiCl3 composition, the acetate group volume in the PVA structure has no significant influence on the contrast and the maximal density of the optical blackening, but strongly influences the photosensitivity. In the PVA-ZnO-Pb(CH3COO)2 photosensitive composition, we can see another effect: increasing the acetate group rate in the PVA structure leads to the significant decrease of the maximal density of the optical blackening and practically doesn't influence the contrast and photosensitivity.
