Waste plastics have become a great public hazard of society because of polluting environment seriously. In order to protect the environment, all countries in the world began to make the law to solve the threat to human survival environmental problem, and try to recycle waste plastics. The current treatment methods of waste plastics mainly included landfill, incineration and recycling. Recycling can be divided into two categories. One is mechanical (physical) cycle that waste plastics were used as a plastic raw material to produce similar products or lower quality products. The other one is feeding (chemical) cycle that waste plastics were cracked into chemical raw materials or fuels through chemical reactions. Waste plastics cracking into liquid fuels

Heat up and start the stirrer and connect the cooling water. With the temperature increasing, the cracking reaction strengthens and the pressure rises. When reaching a certain pressure, open the needle valve (control pressure not more than 2.0 MPa) and vent the oil gas of cracking to the fume cupboard after air cooling and water cooling and measuring the non-condensable gas and alkali washing purification. Keep the scheduled cracking temperature for 60 minutes, then stop heating. Stir continuously until the temperature drops to 200 ?, disconnect the power supply. When the temperature drops to 50 ?, the oil produced in the kettle and the residual carbon produced in the coking reaction process were respectively taken out and weighed. The liquid products are collected, weighed, mixed to distill (< 200 ? fraction is light oil, > 200 ? fraction is heavy oil), and made property analysis. Record the change of the temperature and pressure during the experiment process and observe the reaction conditions under different temperatures.
