The experiments are performed on the benchmark dataset, SVC TASK 2, used in first signature verification competition held in 2004. The dataset contains 20 genuine signatures of forty writers and 20 forgery signatures from five skilled forgers other than the forty writers. We have used three combination of training and testing datasets. The first dataset, DS1, contains 5 genuine signatures for training and other 15 genuine signatures for testing. Thus, testing set comprises 35 signatures (15 genuine signatures and 20 forgery signatures). In the second dataset, DS2, 10 genuine signatures are used for training and 30 signatures (10 genuine signatures other than those used in training and 20 forgery signatures) are used for testing purpose. Similarly, the third dataset, DS3, contains 15 genuine signatures for training and 25 signatures for testing (5 genuine signatures other than those used in training and 20 forgery signatures).

In this way, the overall conclusion is that the categorization helps us to see how each set of features when taken together can be useful in evaluating the performance of the system rather than taking the single feature. Also by implementing sub-trajectory, we have reduced the EER to an optimal level which can be implemented with any state of the art verification technique in signature verification and hence, it can improve the EER further. This shows the effectiveness of the discussed categori- zation and sub-trajectories in signature verification system.
