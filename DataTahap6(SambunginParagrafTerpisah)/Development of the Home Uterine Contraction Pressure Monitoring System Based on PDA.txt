Due to be difficult for pregnant woman doing a periodic inspection at the hospital, a home uterine contraction pressure monitoring system has been developed, which consists of uterine contraction pressure signal collected unit, wireless transmission unit and PDA module. The system is built based on MCU chip-dsPIC33FJ128MC706. The uterine contraction pressure signal is acquired by load cell sensor is FSL1500N2C made by Honeywell, which can be wireless transmitted to PDA via Bluetooth. The signal can be analyzed real-time on PDA and the diagnosis can be made to prevent premature birth or occurrence of abortion effectively.

Whether premature delivery or abortion, uterine contraction play a very important role. Therefore, as soon as possible to find uterine contraction caused by premature birth and threatened abortion has the extremely vital significance for early diagnosis. In recent years, due to the breakthrough of wireless transmission technology and communication technology, the medical instrument signal transmission and processing technologies rapidly develop.
