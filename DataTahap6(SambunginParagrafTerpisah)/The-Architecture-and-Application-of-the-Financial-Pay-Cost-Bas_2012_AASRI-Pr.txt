Through a series designed of students charging system connecting managed functional department of students and outside school bank, it is realized that saving, consumption, student identity authentication, information query, settlement and management etc. This system can deduct all kinds of expenses and deliver student subsidies,scholarship and allowance automatically; May at any time of the fees for statistics collection situation; Can realize the sharing of the information resources, provide various forms of the inquiry statistics function; Follow the principle of safety first, ensure that funds, information security. This article combined with the characteristics and conditions of construction of campus card platform, they put forward the design ideas and its application focusing on the digital campus environment of financial pay cost system.

In the construction of the network, we need to make careful arrangements corresponding to each part. This system use multi-c/s framework, because of the join between the client and the database a "middle layer", making the legality check, data access, business rules, and other work in the middle-tier to handle.Clients do not directly interact with the database, but by the middle-tier connection is established, through the middle tier interacts with the database, established in the Centre will significantly reduce the number of connections on the database server, and dynamically establish and release connections, so clients will no longer be restricted.When business rules change, simply change a component on the middle-tier server, and the client application does not need to do any processing, sometimes even have to change middle-tier components, only need to modify a stored procedure in the database.This makes deployment more secure, large-scale development support system, to avoid single points of failure.Application servers and WEB servers can be deployed to more than one cluster and avoid single points of failure.System network structure is divided into storage networks, networks and access networks.Achieving network security through isolated subnet.

The subsystem which bind the user authentication and billing policies, access control permissions in the policy package in services serves for staff who manage the system and provide a wide range of bulk operations,such as bulk household accounts, bulk renewals, bulk sales, bulk modify and so on to make it easy for users of data maintenance, simplify the Administrator's actions..The subsystem also offers customized user information management capabilities, administrators can be customized according to the habits of users of network operation information, and supporting users in the hostel moved across campus, building and migration between the users online account in certification system.

This subsystem is designed for user level and provides change of user name, password, and other functions.After users log in self service platform, history a record of payment can I network, network, network details and other queries, can also close, pause, and resume the network using such applications.New applications for network users, and campus Portal provides pre-registered Web user interface platform, Web users fill out personal information, so as to ensure the accuracy of the information, reduce the maintenance workload of administrators.

Main bank book module of communication between servers and storage, and data processing, is a communications hub for the entire system, interface design mainly includes: (1) Interface socket communication program: receive and verify information from the earmark machine. (2) Interface design for database storage transfer information, statement, and basic database operations. (3) PC and 89C51 single chip microcomputer serial communication program: realization of serial communication between single-chip microcomputer programs, mainly used for setting a yardage machine IP address.
