The paper describes modeling of semi-active suspension systems based on variable damping coefficient limit. The models are designed in Simulink while the fuzzy logic controller is incorporated through Fuzzy Tool Box. Section 2 describes the modeling of systems and road disturbance profile. Section 3 explicates the design scheme of fuzzy logic controller. Section 4 describes the simulation and results. A parametric analysis is presented based on the statistics. Conclusion is elaborated in Section 5.
