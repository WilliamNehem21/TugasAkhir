Abstract Chaotic signal generation from microring resonators (MRRs) is presented. Two 1.5 lm Gaussians with spectral profile having powers of 600 mW are input into the system of MRRs. Using nonlinear conditions, the chaotic signals can be generated and propagated within the ring medium. Results show that the chaotic signals can be controlled and manipulated by using additional Gaus- sian input into the add port of the MRRs. A balance should be achieved between dispersion and nonlinear lengths when the propagating pulse is soliton. Chaotic output signals from the ring res- onator can be converted to logic codes then inserted into an optical fiber transmission link which has a length of 180 km in order to perform the transmission performance. The transmitted signals in the form of spatial and temporal solitons can be detected at the end of the transmission link.

MRR system have recently attracted research interest because such pulses are characterized by wide bandwidths and high speeds. One main advantage of a multiple soliton transmission system made of integrated microring resonator is the high data-rate transmission for short and long distance [23,24]. The narrower pulses of soliton are recommended in order to improve the system performances. The attenuation of such soliton signals during propagation is much lower compared to the conventional laser pulses which emit peaks of microme- as codes via an optical fiber optic transmission link with the length of 180 km. Clear and filtered signals of spatial and tem- poral solitons can be generated and used for many applications in optical communications. Here the spatial and temporal sig- nals with FWHM of 1.34 pm and 100 ps could be generated respectively.
