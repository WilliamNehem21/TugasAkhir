the timeliness and robustness of tracking on the basis of Ning [6]. The fuzzy particle measurement methods as well as superimposed weight sampling algorithm is employed in the paper to reduce the number of particles and improve the real-time quality. Y. Satoh applied the color characteristics to implement tracking[7].

Where ui,j is the degree of membership of the i-th pixel and the j the pixel. p is the i-th pixel probability of being selected, and N is the total number of pixel. In order to reduce the non-uniformity of the RGB color space, the color of each pixel is converted from RGB color space to the CIE (Commission International de L'Eclairage French abbreviation) L*a * b color space. When c is much smaller than n, c kinds of color local rough set theory and fuzzy histogram calculated from fuzzy C-means (FCM) histogram. c rough color fuzzy clustering core unified color space, defined as follows:

Particle filter algorithm can estimate the a posteriori distribution of the target state ,so it can be maintained with a variety of assumptions of the target state through a large number of particles, and therefore has strong handling capacity with a rapid light changes, the longer time occlusion .Thesis method, however, there are many insufficient or not involved in some research areas, which combined with the special traffic weather (for example, rain, fog, etc.), multi-target tracking will be our next research item.
