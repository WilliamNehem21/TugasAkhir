dimensionless parameters which are taken into account in this study, namely the anisotropic strength ratio, the dimensionless eccentricity, the load inclination angle, and the adhesion factor to the bearing capacity factor. Furthermore, a new model has been proposed to predict the bearing capacity factor for the calculation of the undrained bearing capacity for footings resting on an anisotropic clay using an advanced data-driven method (MOGA-EPR). The new model takes into account the anisotropy, eccentricity, and inclination of the applied load and could be used with confidence in routine designs of shallow foundations in undrained conditions with the consideration of the anisotropic strengths of clays.

However, the study of the bearing capacity factor under eccentric loading that takes the anisotropy of the clay into consideration still re- mains to be discussed. The major purpose of this study is to consider the effect of undrained strength anisotropy on the footing bearing capacity under eccentrical and inclination loading. The numerical analyzes are performed in this study employing the upper and lower bound FELA framework. Additionally, four input dimensionless parameters that have the horizontal force on the footing is disregarded, leading to a reduced influence of the adhesion factor on the bearing capacity. In other words, the adhesion factor has a less significant role when the horizontal force becomes negligible compared to the vertical force. Moreover, the increasing anisotropic strength ratio also resulting in a higher bearing capacity factor due to the isotropic clay properties while the increasing in eccentric length leads to a lower value of bearing capacity factor, this happens due to the facts that a high eccentric length often reduces the effectiveness of the force imparted to the footing. Importantly, a new
