This paper presents a proposal of digital mediation for enhancing the communication between sports media and its user community. The proposal is based on a conceptual model and a proof of concept in the form of a Web application. It is believed that the proposed application can contribute to enrich sports media Web portals with innovative features and to strengthen the relationship with their user community, exploiting the potential contributions of its members. This project also aims at fostering user participation and sharing of opinions in sports media Web portals.

The arrows stand for the open channels of multidirectional communication among key actors. In the model above, technology is not explicitly depicted, since it is considered that the digital dimension is implicitly part of the model. Note that a Web application was implemented based on the proposed model. Similarly, the editor is not explicitly represented, since, as well as technology, it is inherent to the model. It is a neutral element, whose main functions are to create, manage, boost and moderate the participation events, according to the terms of usage and to ensure the users management. This role can be played by a team or by a single person that belongs to the staff of the sports media company which incorporates the Liberopinion platform in its web portal. What matters is that the editor has absolute neutrality and behaves as an authentic information curator of the participation platform [2].

In this paper an approach for fostering user participation in sports media Web portals is proposed. It is intended to improve the communication between sports media and its user community, through open, multidirectional and regulated communication channels. We believe that tools as Liberopinion can also contribute from a pedagogic perspective because they allow the stimulus of a civic spirit, foster collaboration and sharing, and provide support to open and civilized dialog.
