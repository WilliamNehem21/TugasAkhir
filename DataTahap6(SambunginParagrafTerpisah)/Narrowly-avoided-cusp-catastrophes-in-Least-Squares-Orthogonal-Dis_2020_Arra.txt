{d2F/daidaj n . The aim of the optimization is to find the critical points where L = 0, while the rate of convergence to the optimum solution will be governed by the second-order response matrix M. The character of the solution, whether it is a minimum or saddle point, will be determined by the eigenvalues of M. These eigenvalues are a measure of the curvature of F when moving in the direction of the corresponding eigenvector. The gradient L can be expressed [[12], Ch.2] as

use to set the determinant of M+ to zero. In effect, it defines a sub- manifold within which a crossing of solutions becomes theoretically possible. We now need to derive appropriate conditions for this to occur. The function h(u) can be calculated as follows. Taking a derivative of

ever, we do not need the entire streamline, just a set of intermediate points between two critical points. We evaluate these approximately using the method of steepest descent [[23], p.121]: calculate a pre- liminary estimate of a by linearly interpolating between a saddle point and a local minimum. Then perform some iterations of the steepest
