labeled data in this field, but it is very expensive to get in the field of geophysics. To alleviate the problem of scarce samples, adding con- straints to the ANN inversion framework to improve network general- ization ability has become the choice of many researchers. For example, the ANN framework with initial models as constraints (Zhang et al., 2021); A convolution neural network (CNN) employing a physics-guided approach and data drive (Biswas et al., 2019; Sun et al., 2021). Song et al. (2022) proposed an inversion framework based on semi-supervised learning. In this work, we employ another ANN learning architecture named FSL for high resolution pre-stack seismic inversion of reservoir parameters.
