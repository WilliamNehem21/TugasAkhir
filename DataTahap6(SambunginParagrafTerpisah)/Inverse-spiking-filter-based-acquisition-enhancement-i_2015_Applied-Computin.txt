acquisition in order to improve the SNR. Dividing the set of input data into smaller blocks then stripping the C/A code from the data and performing FFT based parallel code phase search technique (performing an algebraic sum of the signal) are known as coherent detection (Bao-Yen and Tusi, 2005). In the non coherent integration method, summing the data blocks of squared correlation val- ues of the acquisition process (performing an absolute sum of the signal) yields good correlation. This increases the signal strength by a factor of 2 and noise

differential and spiking filter combined differential detection methods. Initially the Coherent detection integration period of 10 ms is analyzed. Due to navigation data transition problem, integration time cannot be extended beyond 20 ms and this method can detect only 35 dB-Hz C/N0 level with 100% of probability of detection. Non coherent integration period of 36 ms gives 100% probability of detection only in the signal range of 30 dB-Hz. Both the methods fail to detect the weak signal at 20 dB-Hz power level. Differential detection also fails to detect the signal and it gives only 50% of detection with the same input power level. The inverse spiking filter integrated with the differential detection performs better and is able to locate the PRN 3 with 90% of detection.
