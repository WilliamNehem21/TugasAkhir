The study finds that the measured values of NCOR and FCOR have a relationship with the lithology and porosity of the formation; we can obtain four measured values of NCOR and FCOR which borehole and formation are pure oil and pure water respectively, By ploting the FCOR and NCOR for these conditions to define the quadrilateral in each case. Thus, the width of the quadrilateral is affected by lithology and porosity of the formation. In the general case: all measurement points basically fall on the quadrilateral area. Water holdup in the borehole and formation oil saturation affect the values of NCOR and FCOR ,so the quadrilateral is an indicator to resolve the formation oil saturation and water holdup in the borehole[6] .

Gravel packing is the special well structure in offshore M oilfield, the part of gravel packing mainly in the part of the screen and casing annulus and perforation tunnel. Such as the production string structure in M oilfield, the inner diameter and outer diameter of borehole annulus section are 15.24cm and 21.1cm. But the instrument detection depth is 21cm and the C/O mode logging speed is 0.6m/min, vertical resolution is 61cm [7], so the measured capture cross section of RPM is also affected by the gravel pack. Accordingly, in order to obtain the formation parameters accurately and improve interpretation accuracy, it is necessary to do some quantitative correction for related factors. So the author designed volumetric model corrected formation capture cross sections.
