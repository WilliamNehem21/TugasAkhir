This academic paper introduces reduction strategies for the weak reduction relation, specifically call-by-name, call-by-value, and call-by-need (emphasizing the latter). The paper demonstrates that these strategies are indeed strategies in a technical sense. Due to the undecidability of neededness, additional features such as sharing graphs, environments, and explicit substitutions are typically included to effectively implement call-by-need. However, for system L, call-by-need can be defined within the calculus in an effective manner.

In certain instances, call-by-need (and even minimal strategies) may duplicate expressions, such as within abstractions. The issue of sharing subterms across different instantiations of bound variables is addressed by optimal reduction strategies. Although the research on optimal reduction applied to system L is promising, this paper focuses on the weak reduction approach, which is standard in the implementation of functional languages.

The paper also discusses context-sensitive conditional expression reduction systems (CERS) and their compatibility with the systems defined within the paper. Certain properties of local reduction diagrams are used to reduce the global problem of proving the minimality (or maximality) of a strategy, as proposed by van Oostrom. Additionally, a theorem is derived from parts of theorems 1 and 2 in a related work, which is then utilized in demonstrating the minimality of call-by-need among weak strategies.

The paper provides a proof that includes syntactic verifications, preservation of linearity constraints, subject reduction, and the fact that a closed term cannot become open during reduction. Semantically, it is shown that iter(sn0) u w = wn(u) (i.e., n copies of w applied to u). However, the given rewrite rules actually utilize n+1 occurrences of w and discard one. To address this, the definition is modified to halt at s0 instead of 0.

The paper also discusses the relation between fold right and fold left for lists in functional programming and their similarity to the iterator on numbers. It delves into the iterative reduction policy and its strictness in the first argument, as well as the differences between foldl and foldr in accessing elements of lists. The origins of these list operators being iterators on numbers (primitive recursive schemes) are also highlighted.

Furthermore, the paper provides a definition for call-by-name reduction as leftmost outermost weak reduction, emphasizing that iteration is by name. Call-by-value differs from call-by-name by reducing the argument of an application before contracting the redex and by using iteration by value instead of iteration by name. The paper also presents a decomposition of the reduction for a multi-hole context, and discusses the implications for a strongly normalizing calculus.

System L, discussed in the paper, isolates the linear and non-linear components of a computation. The paper leverages this calculus to study evaluation strategies in this context, where there is a need to control the non-linear aspects of the computation. This approach leads to a simple description of strategies and a definition of minimal strategies within the calculus, with potential implications for current implementation work based around system L.
