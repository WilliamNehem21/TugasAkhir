This paper presents a novel approach for mitigating biases in gyroscopes, focusing specifically on their use in mobile phones. The commonly encountered issue with using gyroscopes is that integrating raw angular rates with non-zero biases causes continuous drift in the estimated orientation. To address this problem, the study develops a sensor fusion algorithm leveraging optical flow from the device's camera to eliminate the bias. The approach utilizes complementary filters and an adaptive reliability filter for the optical flow features to fuse the sensor data, effectively compensating for the bias. Real-world measurements on a mobile device equipped with optical flow were conducted to validate the robustness and reliability of the proposed approach.

Furthermore, the paper discusses the steady improvement in the accuracy of optical flow estimation algorithms, as evidenced by results on the Middlebury Optical Flow Benchmark. The authors investigate recent advances in optical flow accuracy by analyzing the impact of the objective function, optimization method, and modern implementation practices. It is found that median filtering of intermediate flow fields during optimization contributes to recent performance gains, albeit resulting in higher energy solutions. As a result, a new objective formalizing the median filtering heuristic and a top-ranking method on the Middlebury benchmark are derived.

Additionally, the study describes simulations conducted in MATLAB using raw data recorded on the mobile device to test various critical situations and measure the algorithm's reliability. Real-world measurements are emphasized in this paper.

The paper also highlights the use of magnetometers to determine the third absolute angle. By measuring the geomagnetic field, a 3D earth-based absolute orientation can be derived. However, the reliability of magnetometer values may be compromised in non-natural environments, such as buildings or near electrical devices. The study emphasizes the need to consider these limitations when using magnetometer data for orientation estimation.

The filtering algorithm is comprised of three main blocks, with a focus on reliability calculation and aggregation. The reliability calculation and aggregation are thoroughly examined, and the resulting feature displacements and bias-compensated angular rates of the gyroscope are processed using a complementary filter. The aim is to balance the slowly changing but precise optical flow results with the fast-changing gyroscope angular rates. The authors emphasize the simplicity and effectiveness of complementary filters and highlight their compatibility with sophisticated orientation estimators, rendering the application of more complex filters unnecessary in this context.

Future plans involve testing other methods for correlating gyroscope angular rates with optical flow feature displacement values, including the use of Kalman filters and RANSAC for optical flow processing. Additionally, the study aims to explore more sophisticated methods, such as weighted median filters, for feature aggregation.
