Qualitative analysis requires a significant investment of time and resources and is widely recognized in the research community. Video analysis, in particular, poses significant challenges due to its complex nature, often requiring specialized technology and labor-intensive manual processes, such as crafting descriptive narratives, frame-by-frame analyses, inductive extraction of themes, and audio transcription. Analyzing 360-degree spherical videos adds another layer of complexity due to their unique format and interpretation challenges. However, recent advancements in computer vision techniques and artificial intelligence (AI) methods, such as object detection, scene recognition, deep learning, and neural networks, show promise in revolutionizing the analysis of video data by automating manual processes and providing more accurate and efficient results.

Recent technological advances have highlighted the potential use of virtual reality (VR), particularly in the context of simulating real-life experiences in a controlled and safe environment, which can be beneficial for individuals with autism. VR offers benefits such as predictability, structure, customizable task complexity, control, realism, immersion, and automation of feedback, assessment, and reinforcement, which can help individuals with autism develop the skills and confidence needed to navigate real-world situations.

Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have the potential to enhance the teaching and learning process by making inferences, judgments, and predictions in educational settings. There is a growing interest in using AI in education technologies and learning environments, including applications such as intelligent tutoring systems, teaching robots, learning analytics dashboards, and adaptive learning systems. Data mining algorithms can be employed to analyze large datasets of student performance data to identify factors associated with academic success, which can inform instructional strategies and support tailored to individual student needs.

The Virtuoso project, which utilizes a stage-wise approach through 360-degree video modeling and immersive VR scenarios, was designed to simulate the task of using public transportation for autistic adults. The study involved recruiting both autistic and neurotypical participants to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention.

In examining the gaze patterns of autistic individuals using SVVR videos, the study provided insights into their interactions and compared them with neurotypical individuals. However, the study acknowledged the need for further research with larger and more diverse datasets to establish the generalizability and robustness of the findings.

As for the methodology of object detection in SVVR videos, the study highlighted the importance of training computer vision algorithms using specific objects included in the dataset for better results, rather than relying on generic object detection models.

The paper also mentioned the use of GPT-3.5 to improve language and readability, with caution, and emphasized the responsibility of the authors in reviewing and editing the content before publication.
