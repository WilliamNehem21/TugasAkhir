Identifying early-stage apt attacks has been a challenge because previous research lacked a comprehensive dataset on the entire lifecycle of such attacks, hindering effective detection and mitigation efforts. Existing penetration tests and detection methods have been insufficient in combating apt attacks.

To address this issue, much research has focused on using artificial intelligence (AI) to detect and mitigate apt attacks. However, the success of these methods heavily depends on the quality of the datasets used. Furthermore, APTs have increasingly leveraged AI to create more sophisticated attack methods, posing a significant challenge for detection.

In this context, the motivation for this study is to propose an effective detection method for apt attacks using machine learning (ML) classifiers based on known attack patterns. Understanding the lifecycles of APTs can help mitigate vulnerabilities and enable early detection of attacks. The primary objective is to develop a dataset using cyber threat intelligence (CTI) to support the development of detection models and propose an ML-based detection model for apt attacks.

The authors argue that the existing approaches have limitations and propose a new method that involves an extensive collection of behavior patterns and indicators of compromise (IOCs) used by APTs. Such a dataset would be essential for training ML algorithms to enable more effective and reliable detection.

The authors also discuss the challenges associated with using open-source datasets and highlight the need for long-term data collection to capture the diverse behaviors exhibited by APTs. They emphasize the importance of leveraging known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by APT groups to train ML models effectively.

The proposed detection approach employs a multiclass classification problem to classify normal traffic and different stages of APT attacks. The data collection method involved packet capture and simulated normal network traffic, and multiple resources, including CTI sources and SIEM solutions, were utilized to collect APT attack data.

The study utilized various data pre-processing and feature selection techniques to optimize the dataset for ML analysis. Four ML classifiers, including Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), XGBoost (XGB), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), were evaluated using the proposed dataset and compared with existing methods.

The results demonstrated the superior performance of the proposed model, with an accuracy rate of 99.89% and low error rates compared to other classifiers. The authors also compared their model with a previously used approach and found that their dataset yielded valid and reliable results for APT attack detection.

The study concluded that the proposed model, particularly using the XGB classifier, outperformed other classifiers and demonstrated high accuracy and low error rates. The authors emphasized the efficiency and performance advantages of XGB over other classification algorithms based on their findings.

Overall, the study presents a novel approach to detecting APT attacks using ML, supported by a newly created dataset. The results suggest the effectiveness of the proposed model in accurately identifying APT attacks.
