Very little is currently understood about the impact of soil disinfection on bacterial communities. In this study, soil was treated with the chemical fumigant chloropicrin and the biofumigant mustard greens (Brassica juncea). The results showed that while mustard greens had minimal effect on the soil bacterial community structure, chloropicrin drastically reduced soil biomass and the richness of bacterial species. Additionally, chloropicrin significantly altered the bacterial community structure, leading to the dominance of the phylum Firmicutes, which accounted for approximately 75% of the community. However, over a period of more than two months, the proportion of Firmicutes returned to its original level, and the phyla Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria became dominant.

Furthermore, when the soils were treated with wheat bran and a low concentration of ethanol, which served as carbon sources for soil reduction, they did not affect the structure of the soil bacterial communities. Overall, the biofumigant mustard greens were found to have a much less detrimental impact on the soil bacterial community compared to the chemical disinfectant chloropicrin, indicating that mustard greens could be a potential substitute for chloropicrin.

The soil physicochemical properties were analyzed using various methods, including determining soil particle size, pH, and carbon and nitrogen contents. The soil samples were obtained from the farm of the Education and Research Center for Subtropical Field Science at Kochi University and were subjected to different treatments in five replicates.

In addition, the study found that chloropicrin, a toxic gas, directly killed soil organisms, leading to a decrease in biomass. It was also observed that the bacterial community structure did not return to its original state even three months after chloropicrin treatment, indicating that chloropicrin had a lasting disruptive effect on the bacterial community structure.

Furthermore, it was found that soil reduction with various carbon sources, including wheat bran, ethanol, and mustard greens, did not impact the soil bacterial community structures. The presence of weeds in the wheat bran and mustard greens-applied soils suggested that these materials were not as effective as chloropicrin in inhibiting weed growth.

The study also highlighted the biofumigant properties of mustard greens and the formation of a biotoxic element called isothiocyanate from the decomposition of Brassica plants, which inhibits the growth of various plant pathogenic fungi. It was suggested that the glucosinolates present in these plants could offer biocidal activity comparable to synthetic pesticides and antibiotics, making them attractive for soil reduction and biofumigation, and potential replacements for synthetic pesticides like chloropicrin.
