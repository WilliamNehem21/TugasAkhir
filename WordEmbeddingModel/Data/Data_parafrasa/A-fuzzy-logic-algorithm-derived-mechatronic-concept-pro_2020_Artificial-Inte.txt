An above-average height sensor was positioned above the crop to measure the distance between the crop and the weeds within the field and can be adjusted based on the specific crop conditions. The time of flight was utilized to detect interference, and the signal was then sent to a microprocessor (ATmega 2560). A fuzzy logic algorithm implemented in the microprocessor environment calculated the actuation parameters based on the sensor response, soil conditions, forward speed, and plantation conditions. The actuation signal was then transmitted to the motor controller (HB-25, Parallax Inc., Rocklin, CA, USA), and the controller activated the DC motor (Wormdrv-G200-12, Parramatta, NSW, Australia) through pulse width modulation (PWM) to laterally shift the rotary arm for the duration estimated from the algorithm.

Proximity sensors were also integrated into the system for position sensing. The first proximity sensor (P1) was mounted on a ground wheel to measure the forward translation speed of the system, which was then used as an input to the control algorithm. The developed prototype was tested in an instrumented soil bin under various operating conditions. The impact of operating conditions on electronic control parameters, the system's behavioral parameters such as torque during weeding ring operation, and the draft force during lateral shaft shift were evaluated. Additionally, the effect of system and operating conditions on plant damage was observed.

The developed prototype was mounted on an externally controlled mechanical trolley designed for a range of forward speeds and depth arrangements. Various transducers and load cells were installed to measure torque, draft force, and lateral shifting force. All the transducers were connected to a data logger that interfaced with a remote computer for real-time data recording. A liquid crystal display (LCD) was installed to display the lateral shift speed, torque, and draft force.

A fuzzy logic algorithm and the system's behavioral parameters were analyzed using statistical methods. Plant damage appeared to have resulted from tomato crop roots, suggesting the need for crop-specific features in the operating fuzzy algorithm for intra-row shaft shifting. The study concluded that sufficient weeding efficiency and plant damage avoidance were achieved and suggested future refinements and assessments of the system's performance.

The study was funded by the All India Coordinated Research Project (AICRP) on Farm Implements and Machinery, and the authors expressed gratitude for the assistance provided during the study. Additionally, the study referenced a relevant M.Sc. thesis for further background information.

Overall, the study involved the development and testing of a prototype system for intra-row weed control in row crops, and preliminary evaluations showed promising results for weeding efficiency and plant damage control at optimum operational parameters. However, challenges related to dynamic synchronization of electronic control, mechanical actuations, and plantation characteristics were identified and require further exploration and optimization.
