Time series data are inherently noisy, making it challenging to identify non-linear patterns. In recent years, various machine learning techniques such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Functional Link Artificial Neural Networks (FLANN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) have been employed to address the issue of non-linearity in time series data, particularly in the context of financial market prediction.

The related work in the field of financial prediction has focused on effective techniques used by researchers to achieve optimal results. This section discusses the processes involved in data sample collection and dataset regeneration. Additionally, it introduces various predictive models, statistical and optimized feature reduction techniques, and provides an analysis of the experimental results.

The Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) operates on the principle of a single-layer feed-forward neural network (SLFN). Unlike SLFN, ELM does not require tuning of hidden layer nodes and biases at each iteration, resulting in faster learning speed with minimal training error and weight norms. The Moore-Penrose generalized inverse plays a key role in the development of ELM.

Feature reduction techniques are crucial for improving the training of predictive models. Both statistical and optimized feature reduction methods have been employed in the study to identify the most relevant features of the original datasets.

Factor analysis assumes that observed variables are a linear combination of unobservable factors, with some common to multiple variables, while others are unique to each variable. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) differs from Factor Analysis (FA) in that PCA determines mathematical functions of observed variables, while FA aims to identify common factors that produce correlations among observed variables.

In the context of the Firefly Algorithm, variations in light intensity and attractiveness formulation are critical factors. The brightness or intensity of light determines attractiveness, which is associated with the objective function. While the computational complexity of the algorithm is considered to be reasonable, a large population size may increase time complexity.

Key parameters such as population size and number of iterations have significant effects on the performance of the algorithms. Fixed population size and iterations are important for the standard comparison of different algorithms' performances.

Normalization and feature reduction techniques, such as min-max normalization, statistical-based feature reduction employing PCA and FA, and optimized feature reduction utilizing GA, FO, and Firefly Algorithm with Evolutionary Framework, have been incorporated into the study. These techniques reduce the data for input to prediction models including ELM, OS-ELM, and RBPNN.

Four stock market datasets, including BSE Sensex, NSE Sensex, S&P 500 Index, and FTSE 100 Index, were selected for evaluating the prediction model based on their diverse market characteristics.

For the time horizon analysis, ELM with reduced features obtained from PCA and FA consistently outperformed other prediction models for one-day-ahead prediction. Similarly, optimized feature reduction methods such as GA, FO, and Firefly Algorithm with Evolutionary Framework were found to provide effective solutions and avoid local minima traps.
