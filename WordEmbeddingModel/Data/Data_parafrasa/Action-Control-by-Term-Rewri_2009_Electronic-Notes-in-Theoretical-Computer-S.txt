In this section, we present fundamental concepts and notations for term rewriting that will be referenced throughout the remainder of the paper. We direct readers to additional resources for further information. A signature f is a finite collection of function symbols along with their fixed arities.

Here, x represents an enumerable set of variables x1, x2, etc., and t(f, x) represents the collection of terms constructed from f and x. Terms are identified as finite labeled trees, and the symbol at the root of t is denoted as root(t). Positions are sequences of positive integers. The subterm of t at position p is denoted as t|p, and the result of replacing t|p with u at position p in t is denoted as t[u]p.

Diverse forms of group ethos, such as dualistic satisfaction, are possible within the shared group ethos. Other possible forms of group ethos, such as group competitiveness and altruism, serve as the foundation for various e-collective meta-policies that can be naturally represented within our framework.

For example 3.2, we consider the empowerment theories empm1, empm2, empm3, and empm4 for e-collective members m1, m2, m3, and m4, respectively. These empowerment theories operate under the assumption that the principle of maximal satisfaction should be enforced.

In addition to an FNT theory and an EMP theory, each agent m within the e-collective will establish an authorization theory (auth theory). An auth theory consists of rules that specify whether m authorizes a client c to perform an action a on a resource r when m is functioning in f-mode or c-mode. The specification of the authorization policy may adhere to any standard access control models, such as a role-based authorization policy. We skip the specific details of the access control model and only present the general format of the rules.

While termination and confluence of term rewriting systems are generally undecidable properties, there exists an extensive body of work that aims to establish decidable sufficient conditions for confluence and termination. For example, orthogonal systems are confluent, and systems defining recursive functions using a primitive recursive scheme are terminating. These conditions have been utilized to derive sufficient conditions for totality and confluence of access control policies and can similarly be applied to action control policies.
