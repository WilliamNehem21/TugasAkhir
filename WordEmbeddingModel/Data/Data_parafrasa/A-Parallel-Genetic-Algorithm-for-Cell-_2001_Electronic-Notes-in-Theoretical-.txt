In this study, we present a novel parallel genetic algorithm designed for segmenting cell images in the presence of significant noise. Our work addresses the challenge of the slow convergence of traditional genetic algorithms, which were used in our earlier research. We introduce a priori knowledge of cell shape into our method by incorporating an elliptical cell contour model to describe the cell boundary. The proposed approach involves obtaining the gradient image using the Canny edge detector, followed by employing a kernel-based dynamic clustering technique to identify image points likely to belong to each cell. Subsequently, we utilize a parallel genetic algorithm to adjust the parameters of the cell contour model and achieve the best matching. Our method's effectiveness in segmenting images of elliptically shaped cells is demonstrated through the successful segmentation of noisy human thyroid and small intestine cell images.

After locating the approximate cell positions, we use a kernel-based dynamic clustering method to identify the image points potentially associated with each cell boundary. This method involves defining a kernel to represent a cluster, and determining whether a sample point belongs to a cluster using a measurement. By employing this method, we can identify image points with a high probability of belonging to each cell. Once the image points potentially belonging to a cell are detected, we search for an ellipse that best matches the cell boundary in a relatively small space, leading to a significant reduction in solution search time.

We propose a parallel genetic algorithm for optimizing the parameters of the mathematical model to match the cell contour in Section 4, and present the experimental results in Section 5. Section 6 concludes the paper and outlines future work.

Furthermore, we describe different migration strategies and subpopulation self-evolution strategies for the parallel genetic algorithm based on the basic algorithm discussed earlier. We explore various strategies, such as the island model and the stepping stone model, for migration. Additionally, we introduce a unique migration strategy, randomly determining which sub-populations will migrate their best individuals to others, to reduce communication overhead and achieve a better balance between communication and the resemblance to natural processes.

The genetic algorithm procedure involves initializing each chromosome with five randomly generated integers as the index of edge image points, selecting chromosomes for reproduction, employing crossover and mutation operators, and determining convergence based on the entropy of the fitness distribution function.

In summary, we propose an innovative approach to cell image segmentation under noisy conditions by combining kernel-based dynamic clustering and a parallel genetic algorithm. Our approach incorporates both edge information and shape information of the cell contour, resulting in high noise resistance. By leveraging a parallel genetic algorithm as the optimizer, we achieve more accurate solutions and a speedup due to the sharing of population evaluations across multiple processors. Our results suggest a promising direction for future research into automatic algorithm design in biomedical applications, particularly related to automatic initialization.
