The academic paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the role-based trust management framework, while Section 3 demonstrates its flexible extension with weights and the corresponding evaluation algorithm. The prototype implementation on mobile devices is discussed in Section 4, and examples of credentials, policy statements, and performance evaluations are provided in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 contains the conclusions and outlines future work.

Regarding the elements, the paper discusses the role of the credential issuer as "a" and the role membership, which includes all entities from the external "r2" role issued by the "p" principal, where "p" is a member of "r1" of the default principal "a". The dimension of "a.r" should be no less than that of "p.r2".

The paper emphasizes the critical nature of a shared vocabulary in systems representing rights as attributes, particularly in environments like the grid. To effectively delegate permissions on resources, all involved principals must use consistent terminology to specify resource permissions and delegation conditions. If incompatible schemes are used, credentials cannot be meaningfully combined, potentially preventing the granting of intended permissions. The meaningful definition of a role requires that all involved parties have access to the role structure and potentially the permissions granted to it. An adsd is defined to implement this structure using standard data types or by defining new ones, and it is emphasized that this document must be public. This approach allows for strongly typed credentials and policies, and any credential using a role term needs to refer to the specific adsd defining the role name and its data types.

RTML defines a set of credential/access rule definitions, each containing a head role term and a body with different elements. The paper adopts an abstract syntax to describe these definitions, with "r" representing the head role term, "r1" and "r2" representing other role terms, and "a" as the credential issuer, while "b" and "d" represent generic issuers.

As previously mentioned, credential and access rule documents have the same structure, with the main difference being that the issuer value is absent in the access rule document, as it defines a policy and the issuer of these rules is the policy issuer itself. Furthermore, the signature element is also omitted, meaning the issuer does not need to verify its policy.

The paper outlines the ongoing implementation of the trust management framework with trust weights on mobile devices supported by the J2ME platform and CLDC1.1/MIDP2.0 profiles. The extended version of the prototype was initially implemented as part of the authorization framework for grid services but was modified to minimize the size of the final application and take into account J2ME limitations. The Java language was chosen for its suitability in developing and testing mobile applications, and various simulation environments such as NetBeans are freely available.

In the implementation, all credentials were digitally signed using the XML digital signature standard with some extensions (RFC-4050), and cryptographic algorithms for J2ME were imported from the Bouncy Castle project. The paper describes how the signature was embedded into the XML encoded credential representation and outlines the packages used to prepare the input to the RTML parser.

The paper introduces the implementation of the trust management framework on mobile devices, embedding trust weights into the RT credentials to support reputation and recommendation models. The algorithm to compute weights is presented, and experiments were conducted to test the prototype's performance, with results showing that credentials verification and validation were the most time-consuming aspects compared to credentials and access rules parsing and evaluation.

The paper plans to reduce time expenses by using light cryptographic signing algorithms and developing an adoptive caching model for credentials verification and validation. Additionally, the paper expresses interest in conducting a complex case study to demonstrate the benefits of the trust management framework with trust weights, examining a grid scenario to assess the interoperability of the framework across various devices.
