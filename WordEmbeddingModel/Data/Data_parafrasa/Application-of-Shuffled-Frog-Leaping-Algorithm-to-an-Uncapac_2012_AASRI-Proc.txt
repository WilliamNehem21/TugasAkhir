The shuffled frog leaping algorithm (SFLA) has gained significant attention in academic and engineering optimization fields in recent years due to its unique and effective meta-heuristic approach. By combining the strengths of memetic algorithm (MA) with strong local search (LS) capabilities and particle swarm optimization (PSO) with effective global search (GS) capabilities, SFLA demonstrates strong optimum-searching abilities and ease of implementation. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of SFLA in solving uncapacitated single-level lotsizing (SLLS) problems through comparison with various heuristic algorithms, demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of SFLA.

Additionally, genetic algorithm (GA) and PSO have been used to address multilevel lot-sizing (MLLS) problems, of which the single-level lot-sizing problem is a specific case. SFLA, proposed by Eusuff and Lansey in 2003, is a combination of MA and PSO and has become a prominent method in intelligent optimization fields. Despite its potential, few studies have explored the application of SFLA to SLLS problems. Therefore, this study utilizes SFLA, implemented in C++ language, to investigate its suitability for solving SLLS problems.

SFLA, a meta-heuristic based on the memetic evolution of a group of frogs seeking optimal food sources, combines the strengths of MA and PSO. In SFLA, a population of frogs is divided into subsets known as memeplexes, representing different cultures of frogs, with each memeplex undergoing independent local searches.

Within each memeplex, the frogs with the best and worst fitness are denoted as xb and xw, respectively, while the frog with the best fitness globally is denoted as xg. A process similar to PSO is applied to improve xw within each memeplex.

Considering the characteristics of SLLS problems, solutions are represented as one-dimensional vectors composed of 0s and 1s, and are easily translated into production decisions based on known product demand. A crossover operator, akin to that of GA, is applied to generate new solutions from the best and worst frogs within each memeplex, with the superior solution chosen based on objective function values.

The study demonstrates the successful application of SFLA to solve uncapacitated SLLS problems, presenting promising results. In future research, the experimental framework will be expanded to accommodate more complex product structures and larger scales. Furthermore, efforts will be made to enhance the approach by integrating additional heuristics with SFLA.
