In this study, we aim to compare languages based on their relative expressive power by attempting to encode one language in another, while adhering to certain reasonable properties. Defining these properties is crucial for the meaningfulness of our research: overly lenient properties would result in uninformative outcomes (as most encodings would be possible) while excessively strict properties would be unproductive (with very few encodings being possible).

We consider encodings that adhere to specific properties such as compositionality, name invariance (i.e., encodings of two source processes differing only in their free names must differ only in the associated free names), and operational correspondence. In Section 4, we systematically develop a hierarchy for every pair of languages, providing encodability/separation results. Finally, in Section 5, we conclude by mentioning related work. We have omitted the motivations behind the languages in this extended abstract; for more details, refer to the original papers introducing these languages.

It is important to note that a migration at 'l' is permissible only if 'l' is an existing locality of the net. The current formulation is preferred for simplicity, although our proofs do not rely on this choice.

The boxed ambient calculus, as presented in [citation], evolves the ambient calculus by removing the open action, which is considered too powerful and potentially dangerous. To enable communication between different ambients, the boxed ambient calculus allows a restricted form of non-local communication, where every input/output action can be performed locally (if tagged with direction), towards the enclosing ambient (if tagged with direction 'u'), or towards an enclosed ambient 'n' (if tagged with direction 'n').

We define an encoding as a translation that satisfies five specific properties, and we use 's' to represent processes of the source language (i.e., 'l1') and 't' to represent processes of the target language (i.e., 'l2').

As previously mentioned, an encoding should be compositional. To formally define this notion, we utilize the concept of k-ary context, denoted as ( 1;...; k), which is a term where 'k' occurrences of 0 are replaced by the k holes 1,..., k.

We use the abbreviation (x1, x2, x3) for (x1).open pol.(x2).open pol.(x3) and 'b1', 'b2', 'b3' for b1 pol[ b2 pol[ b3]], with 'pol' being a reserved name for implementing polyadic communications. The proof that the translation presented satisfies all the properties listed in Section 3 is omitted for brevity; interested readers can find it elsewhere.

We have organized these languages into a clear hierarchy based on their relative expressive power. Additionally, we extend our analysis to various dialects of 'ma/ba/sa' that have emerged in recent literature and compare each dialect with the language it originated from.
