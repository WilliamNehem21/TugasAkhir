To ensure a reliable power supply, it is essential to rapidly and accurately classify faults on transmission lines in the wide-area transmission network for protection purposes. The injection of current from distributed generation (DG) into transmission lines leads to a reduction in the amplitude characteristic of the fault current protection, resulting in decreased system reliability. To address this, an online fault classification method using global and local discriminant analysis (GLDA) is proposed, leveraging wide-area measurements in the power system. This method aims to enhance phase characteristics and reduce computational load. Additionally, local current phase shift analysis is conducted to improve spatiotemporal characteristics during single line to ground (SLG) fault processes. A new approach for measuring the spatiotemporal characteristic, known as characteristic entropy (CE) of the grid impedance in individual buses, is proposed to fully assess the spatiotemporal characteristic distribution. Building on the analysis of spatiotemporal characteristics, a multi-priority GLDA fault classification method is developed to coordinate fault phase classification using phasor measurement unit (PMU) data. This approach is shown to reduce computational load, provide resilience against measurement noise, and mitigate the impact of transition resistance. The proposed GLDA-CE method is validated using the IEEE 39-bus system with 10 PMUs, demonstrating improved classification accuracy and response speed compared to conventional statistical entropy and neural network methods. Specifically, the GLDA-CE method successfully classifies 226 entire power outages and 600 single phase outages within 1.621 seconds.

When a fault occurs in the wide-area transmission network, the fault branch isolated by the protection relay becomes stressed along with the rest of the grid. In the event of a short circuit fault, the network must swiftly classify the fault section and self-heal.

A model based on circuit analysis is used to estimate the relationship between voltage phase angle shifts at two arbitrary points on long-distance transmission lines, considering random fault distances. This phase analysis is used to characterize the synchronization signal sags at fault positions during dynamic processes. A nonlinear characteristic model for active power flow in a transmission branch is established using a hyperbolic tangent function and is identified using entropy index to measure characteristic matrix consistency.

The distributed fault classification strategy consists of two stages. First, the potential fault section is estimated based on detection criteria in the wide-area PMU monitoring system. Then, in the potential fault terminal, voltage and current phase signals are predicted, and the fault phase is identified based on classification criteria.

The proposed characteristic model, which is based on phase angle analysis, can extract transient sags and represent the dynamic behavior of high-resistance faults in power lines. 

This paper introduces a novel fault classification method for the wide-area transmission network based on spatiotemporal characteristic analysis. It focuses on extracting the transient spatiotemporal characteristic of fault currents and quantifying the order degree of the spatiotemporal characteristic using fault classification criteria. The proposed GLDA-CE fault classification method demonstrates high generalization capability in the presence of measurement noise and fault resistance effects, thanks to its characteristic enhancement and coordinating identification framework. The hierarchical classification strategy reduces the fault search zone and response time. Consequently, the GLDA-CE fault classification method achieves a classification accuracy of 92.414% and a fast response time of 1.274 seconds, outperforming the WNN, RBF, and INNC methods. This approach enables synchronous monitoring of the power system and lays the foundation for transmission system restoration.
