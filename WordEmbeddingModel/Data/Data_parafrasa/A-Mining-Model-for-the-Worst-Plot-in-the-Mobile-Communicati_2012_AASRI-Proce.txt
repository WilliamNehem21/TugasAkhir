With network coverage and capacity having reached high levels, the primary focus of network operation management is to provide high-quality network services to users. The performance of the network is closely related to the quality of its worst cells. This paper introduces a mining model for identifying the worst cells in wireless networks, which incorporates the use of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to determine index weights and integrates these weights into a clustering algorithm. An example has demonstrated the feasibility of this model, highlighting its significance for the development and optimization of wireless networks.

Mobile communication is a highly advanced form of communication, with network coverage and capacity reaching high levels. However, concerns over quality, cost, and service have become more prominent. Ensuring that communication networks run optimally and provide users with high-quality services is a fundamental task for network operation and management. The identification of the worst cells has become crucial in assessing the quality of wireless networks. This paper presents a mining model based on a clustering algorithm for efficiently identifying the worst cells, providing a more accurate reflection of their severity and enabling precise optimization measures. Hence, this model plays a crucial role in the optimization of wireless networks.

The different indices for the target layers hold varying levels of importance, and in this paper, the AHP is employed to determine these index weights. The AHP method compares the importance of one index against another, establishes the corresponding judgment matrix, and solves the eigenvalues of the matrix.

In this model, the worst cells are treated as outliers, and a clustering algorithm is chosen for analysis. Cluster analysis, as a quantitative method, provides a more accurate and detailed classification tool for data analysis. The specific approach utilizes the k-means algorithm, which considers distance as the measure of similarity and aims to achieve compact and independent clusters.

The proposed model consists of four modules: the index module, data module, mining module, and optimization module. The index module includes index selection and the determination of index weights using the AHP method. The data module involves data collection and processing. The mining module integrates the index weights into the data mining algorithm to promptly and accurately identify the worst cells. The optimization module focuses on the correlation analysis of performance indexes and takes appropriate measures based on different scenarios.

According to the clustering results, cells in cluster 1 exhibit good indicators and do not require immediate attention. In contrast, cells in cluster 4 have the worst indicators and need to be promptly addressed. Cells in clusters 2 and 3 fall between clusters 1 and 4, necessitating different measures based on their specific situations.

The proposed mining model based on a clustering algorithm, incorporating index weights, presents a new approach for effectively identifying the worst cells. While it holds significant importance for the development and optimization of wireless networks, it still presents several challenges. For instance, it mainly focuses on congestion and interference problems when selecting indicators, while neglecting other performance indicators. Additionally, there are shortcomings in the k-means algorithm and subjectivity in the AHP method. Therefore, further research is required to address and optimize the identification of worst cells in wireless networks.
