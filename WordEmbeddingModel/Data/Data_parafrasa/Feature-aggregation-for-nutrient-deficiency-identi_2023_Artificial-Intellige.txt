The paper discusses two approaches for detecting nutrient deficiencies in plants, namely destructive and non-destructive methods. It highlights the potential for error in laboratory testing, which is a destructive method, as it is susceptible to human error. On the other hand, the non-destructive method of digital image processing with machine learning is recommended for its objectivity in producing results.

The study aims to classify the health conditions of six chili plant variations using a combination of shape, texture, and color features. Since chili cultivation in Indonesia often happens in unregulated lighting conditions, relying solely on one feature, such as color, can lead to identification errors. Consequently, the study explores several features for nutrient deficiency identification, focusing on color, shape, and texture. Various machine learning and deep learning methods, including MLP, SVM, Naive Bayes, RFT, and CNN, are evaluated to compare their performance in the data.

The research involves sampling seven plants in a hydroponic environment with different macronutrient doses to observe visible characteristics over seven days. Feature extraction from the chili plant images encompasses color, texture, shape, geometry, and other attributes. The study analyzes the effectiveness of color extraction methods using statistical values of the RGB and HSV color models. Furthermore, the texture features are extracted through methods such as LBP and GLCM, while shape features are obtained using Hu moments and statistical analysis.

The paper highlights the significance of texture features in identifying macronutrient deficiencies, with calcium being a class that is distinctly recognizable based on textural characteristics. However, relying solely on color for analysis may make it challenging to distinguish the class labeled calcium from healthy plants. The study also details the usage and efficacy of the LBP and GLCM methods for texture feature extraction.

The research compares the performance of different machine learning models, such as MLP, Naive Bayes, RFT, and SVM, and explores the impact of different hyperparameters on the classification models. Additionally, it emphasizes the importance of accuracy, precision, and recall measurements for assessing model performance.

The study conducts several experiments to compare the performance of individual features, feature combinations, and various hyperparameters across different machine learning models. It highlights the importance of selecting the right combination of features and hyperparameters to achieve the best model performance.

Augmentation of features, such as color + texture, color + shape, and texture + shape, is explored to improve accuracy. The study finds that the combination of RGB color and GLCM texture results in the highest accuracy. Furthermore, the research delves into the impact of learning rate and epoch value variations on model performance, stressing the need to find the right balance between these parameters to avoid overfitting or underfitting.

The paper addresses the challenges associated with identifying certain plant conditions, such as overlapping characteristics, and discusses the potential for applying the developed model in real-world agricultural environments, including intelligent hydroponic farming systems.

The study concludes by outlining future research directions and mentioning the funding received for the research from the Directorate of Research and Community Service, Deputy for Strengthening Research and Development, Ministry of Research, Technology/National Research and Innovation Agency of the Republic of Indonesia.
