The recent COVID-19 pandemic has led to significant changes in our daily lives, with many countries implementing various measures to reduce the spread of the virus. One effective action that has been taken is the practice of social distancing, which involves maintaining a certain physical distance from others when interacting outside of personal spaces and with a limited community of contacts.

This paper is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses the background and related work in indoor localization technologies and GDPR-based access control. Section 3 describes the reference architecture for an indoor localization system (ILS). Section 4 details three reference use cases: visiting a museum, airport terminal access, and shopping assistance. Section 5 discusses challenging issues for the real-world implementation of an ILS, and Section 6 outlines the evaluation framework.

Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), LTE, and Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) signals, as well as Wi-Fi-based solutions, are commonly used for indoor localization. Wi-Fi solutions, in particular, offer high performance in terms of localization accuracy at a reduced cost of maintenance and installation.

Many mobile applications have been developed to facilitate social distancing, ranging from contact tracing apps like Immuni (developed by the Italian health minister) to queue management applications like UFirst. These apps often provide easy-to-use interfaces and have seen widespread adoption through app stores.

The approach taken in this paper is to frame a reference architecture for indoor localization that can be adapted to various scenarios. The architecture is designed to be modular and customizable, and it emphasizes privacy by design, drawing inspiration from the European GDPR framework.

The paper discusses the benefits of indoor localization systems in terms of tracking people and measuring physical distance. It also emphasizes the importance of standardization to enable user agents to discover and connect to available ILSs, thereby enabling seamless indoor navigation.

The interaction between the ILS and end-users is crucial to the system's success, and the paper suggests the use of intuitive and multi-modal interfaces to enhance user experience. It also outlines key functional components and communication and interaction orchestrators necessary for the operation of an ILS.

The paper also addresses challenges related to privacy, trust, and security, as well as technical issues related to the deployment of indoor localization systems. It underscores the importance of incorporating privacy by design principles and data minimization approaches into the design of indoor localization systems.

The paper discusses the practicality of adopting indoor localization systems for social distancing and highlights the need to explore alternatives beyond smartphone apps, such as infrastructure-based solutions. It also emphasizes the importance of automatic tools to support social distancing in indoor environments.

Overall, the paper presents a comprehensive overview of the design, implementation, and challenges associated with indoor localization systems for social distancing in various real-world scenarios.
