Many quantum algorithms typically receive input, perform calculations, and ultimately produce output, which can be either classical or quantum. However, this conventional framework does not account for situations where a program generates output before fully terminating, leading to the possibility of non-terminating programs producing outputs, potentially of infinite length. An example of such a program is one that enumerates a set.

In this work, we adopt a philosophy and present fully abstract semantics for quantum programs with classical output streams. The model is based on the concept of the program's execution being viewed as a physical measurement process on the program's state. This measurement process takes a quantum state as input (representing the initial state of the system), produces a classical measurement result (reflecting the output during the program's execution), and leaves the system in a new state. This measurement process can be described using the established PMVM formalism. For non-terminating programs, the concept of the post-execution state is not applicable, and as such, these programs are modeled by measurements without a post-measurement state, known as POVMs.

An important focus of this work is on the modeling of loops, as the standard approach of defining a loop as a least fixed point becomes challenging in the context of non-terminating programs potentially having outputs. Instead, we propose an alternative approach to uniquely defining the semantics of a loop using intuitive axioms.

It is important to note that this summary of quantum mechanical formalism does not serve as an introduction to quantum mechanics; rather, it aims to establish the terminology used in the paper. For a more introductory approach, readers are directed to other sources.

The paper also discusses the composition of mixed measurements p and q, where the composition qp intuitively signifies first measuring p and then, if p terminates, measuring q. The outcome of this experiment is then the combined outcomes of p and q, or just the outcome of p, depending on whether q has been applied. These properties are shown to define the composition qp. It is also highlighted that if in doubt, explicitly writing "switch" is necessary.

Furthermore, the paper introduces the concept of measuring the parity of x1,..., xn without performing a complete measurement. This measurement involves projecting the state onto a subspace based on the outcome of a measurement, and a formal definition for this concept is provided. Additionally, an example involving entanglement and an EPR pair is presented.

Finally, the paper explains the representation of a program while(b) p, which involves repeatedly measuring b and applying p when b yields a true outcome. The output of the program is the concatenation of the outcomes of all invocations of p during the loop, until b yields a false outcome.
