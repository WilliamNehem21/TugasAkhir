Frequently, there is a growing need to access and exchange sensitive data across intricate and dispersed computer systems. To maintain data confidentiality, numerous distributed access control mechanisms have been developed, aiming to prevent unauthorized actions before they occur by making real-time access decisions.

The paper investigates the application of the audit logic framework in the electronic health record (EHR) setting, emphasizing a shift from a priori access control to a posteriori auditing mechanisms. The authors formalize a scenario involving medical personnel and health records to demonstrate the practical implementation of this access control mechanism in the EHR domain. Furthermore, the paper discusses the advantages and disadvantages of employing a posteriori access control mechanisms as opposed to preventive ones in the specific EHR context.

The paper also discusses the secure overriding of decisions made by a preventive access control system called the privilege calculus, highlighting the minimal nature of the preventive access control mechanism in their approach. Moreover, it is emphasized that the decision of when and which users to audit lies with the auditors.

The audit logic framework is shown to allow nested says predicate, making the language semi-decidable, a capability absent in other security policy modeling frameworks. Furthermore, the paper discusses the application of trust management, coupled with auditing, as a potential solution for large distributed EHR systems, drawing on the reputation-based trust management model proposed in the context of digital rights management (DRM).

The paper also presents a policy language grammar for expressing access control policies, which are built using a set of atomic predicates that can be permissions or conditions. The policies are created using logical connectives to combine permissions and conditions, thereby enabling complex policy specification.

Finally, the paper touches upon the execution of auditing at the session layer and the creation of logged actions with their timestamps, emphasizing the need for secure logging devices to prevent log forgery.

Overall, the paper delves into the practical application and implications of using the audit logic framework and a posteriori access control mechanisms in the complex and sensitive context of EHR systems.
