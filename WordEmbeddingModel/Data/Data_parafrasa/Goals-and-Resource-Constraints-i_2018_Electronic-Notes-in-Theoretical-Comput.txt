Instances of collective adaptive systems (CAS) are abundant in nature, ranging from the swarming behaviors of insects to patterns of epidemic spread in humans. These systems are characterized by a large number of simple entities or agents with limited perception but which interact with their neighbors, often resulting in complex emergent behavior at the system level that is difficult to predict based solely on the behavior of individual agents.

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 introduces the carma process algebra. The proposed extension for specifying individual-level resource constraints and global goals is described in Section 3, with illustrations provided through a swarm robot model in Section 4. The developed software tool for experimenting with the proposed changes is presented in Section 5. Finally, the paper concludes in Section 6.

Carma is a novel stochastic process algebra designed for representing systems within the CAS paradigm. The language provides a rich set of communication primitives and makes use of attributes, captured in a store associated with each component, to enable attribute-based communication. For example, the location attribute can be used to model systems with limited communication scope, spatial heterogeneity, or restricted interaction to co-located components.

Processes within a carma component interact with other components through defined communication primitives, supporting both unicast and broadcast communication, as well as locally synchronous and globally asynchronous communication. Distinct predicates associated with senders and potential receivers are used to filter possible interactions, with communication actions taking time assumed to be an exponentially distributed random variable. 

Section 4 omits the precise syntax of expressions for brevity. However, it is assumed that expressions are built using a combination of values, attributes (sometimes prefixed with "my"), variables, and the special term "now" to refer to the current time.

Section 5 shifts the focus to global goals for systems, which can represent desired functional behavior or global properties. Monitoring of state-based goals is discussed, and a simple initial implementation of mapping defined goals to measures is presented, albeit with some current language restrictions.

The paper introduces a software tool developed to experiment with proposed changes to the carma language, including an extension to the parsing machinery to support the new syntax. The tool constructs a new carma model reflecting specified constraints and goals, differing from the original in several key ways.

The work presented in the paper is motivated by the application of a stochastic process algebraic framework to guide the design of control policies for highly-distributed computer-based systems such as robot swarms and wireless sensor networks. Previous work in this area is outlined, including the application of formal methods to study CAS, particularly in the context of robot swarms.

The paper also provides an example demonstrating the use of resource constraints and global goals in the analysis of CAS, specifically through a model of a robot swarm with a simple control policy, which is compared to the uncontrolled case, with simulated trajectories monitored for satisfaction of a prescribed global goal.
