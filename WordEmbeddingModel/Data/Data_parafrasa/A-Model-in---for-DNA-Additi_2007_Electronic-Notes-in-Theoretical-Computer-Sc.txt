The mechanism of biomolecular computing, which is based on the algorithm of DNA, is essential for various DNA applications. Research by Eric Winfree and his colleagues has contributed significantly to this field, yielding important insights and findings [17,18].

The relationship between biomolecular disciplines and computer science is not straightforward, as there is a mutual benefit between the two. DNA computing, with its advantage of high parallelism, offers efficiency in solving complex problems, such as NPC problems. Conversely, theories in computer science, particularly mathematical ones based on computer automation, can enhance the analysis and understanding of biological processes, especially on the molecular level. These two aspects interact in multiple ways, driving further development in both fields.

The algorithm described here is focused on efficiently constructing a DNA-driven device, prioritizing time savings over space. It employs a brute force approach, preparing all possible results during bit-computing and combining them to obtain a final result. The algorithm demonstrates satisfactory time efficiency from a theoretical perspective, with a linear relationship to the number of bio-steps and the required number of DNA oligonucleotides being linear in the maximum bits of the two numbers.

However, challenges arise when operating in an in vitro environment, including potential error rates during connection and read-out processes, making it difficult to scale up the algorithm. The computational procedure is also inherently discontinuous, making certain computations incompatible with others. These limitations need to be addressed before the algorithm can be practically applied in DNA computers, mirroring challenges faced by other algorithms in this domain.

Moreover, the activation and connection processes involving proteins are crucial components of the algorithm, which require careful consideration and understanding. Examples and rules related to how proteins are activated and connected are essential for a better comprehension of the algorithm and its implications.
