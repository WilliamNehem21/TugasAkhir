Cities around the world are becoming testing grounds for advanced robotics and automation technologies that are being applied across various industries and societal domains. The 4th industrial revolution, characterized by the integration of robotics and automated technologies, is becoming a reality, as these technologies hold great potential for transforming businesses and everyday life. This transformation is made possible by significant advancements in computer capabilities, the widespread use of powerful algorithms in digital systems, new technological developments, and enhanced urban connectivity. These technological advancements are creating new opportunities for the expanded deployment of robotics and automation in manufacturing processes and other domains.

State estimation, which involves estimating the probable value based on observations, is fundamental for various applications such as mobile robotics, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), monitoring systems, intelligent grids, and healthcare condition monitoring. Accurate state estimation is essential for aerial robot technologies, serving as a basis for more advanced operations like route planning and tracking. State estimation becomes even more challenging when applied to automated clusters of drones, as each drone in a swarm must determine its own state as well as the relative positions of other drones. In practical settings, the widespread use of remote systems by robotics researchers, such as motion-capturing devices and ultra-wideband (UWB) systems with anchoring, has significantly limited the application of aerial swarm technologies. To enable efficient robot control, fault detection, and accurate state estimation, the novel AGDSVM-GF technique is proposed.

The remaining sections of this paper include a summary of the existing literature (Part II), an illustration of the AGDSVM-GF architecture (Part III), the design and testing results of the AGDSVM-GF approach (Part IV), and the conclusion of this work (Part V).

In the field of endoscope imaging, robot mechanics, and system modifications, the HESS-DNN algorithm is tested using the Hernia-20 dataset, which represents actual inguinal hernia reconstruction surgery. The results demonstrate that the hierarchical architecture of the HESS-DNN algorithm significantly improves fine-grained estimation methods throughout the entire operation. Furthermore, a method for estimating the penetration and pull states of sutures needles using YOLOv3 and a CNN is presented, enabling the automated surgical tool to reposition the needle even if the initial tugging attempt fails. Additionally, the study presents the development and validation of a hidden Markov model for real-time assessment of human emotional states in response to robot movements, based on physiological signals such as heartbeat, sweating rate, and facial muscle contraction.

The study also features the utilization of a three-axial gyro, three-axial accelerometer, and three-axial magnetometer in a micro-electro-mechanical structure (MEMS)-based orientation sensor to obtain angular speed data, vibratory velocity data, and magnetic field strength measurements.

Pre-processing, including normalization and feature extraction, is crucial for data mining and analysis. The paper discusses the challenges associated with feature extraction, such as computational complexity and storage limitations when dealing with large and high-dimensional datasets. It also presents the use of linear discriminant analysis (LDA) for feature extraction in scenarios with small sample sizes or high-dimensional data.

For fault detection in multi-joint robotic systems, the paper proposes the use of a support vector machine (SVM) classifier based on characteristics analyzed by the state estimation method. The study also introduces the variable gain super twisting sliding mode (VGTwSM) for fault-tolerant control, as well as a fault detection and exclusion (FDE) technique utilizing residuals and thresholding based on the Bhattacharyya distance (BD).

In conclusion, the proposed methods demonstrate good error prediction and computational efficiency, showcasing their potential for practical application.
