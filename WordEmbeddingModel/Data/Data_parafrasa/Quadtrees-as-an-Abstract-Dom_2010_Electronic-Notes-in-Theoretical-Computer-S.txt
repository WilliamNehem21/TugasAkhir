Quad trees have been widely used in computer graphics and spatial databases for representing regions in two-dimensional space. Given the flexibility of this hierarchical data structure to support non-convex and disconnected regions, there is a natural inquiry into whether quad trees can serve as the foundation for an abstract domain. This paper investigates this possibility and proposes that quad trees provide a novel approach to weakly relational domains, with their hierarchical structure inherently suited for representation using boolean functions.

Furthermore, the paper explores the potential for capturing higher-dimensional relationships through quad tree elements. While the elements of the quad tree domain are inherently spatial, they are derived from collections of quad trees, with each quad tree in a collection pertaining to a pair of variables that may not be disjoint. As a result, the various quad trees in a domain element interact through their intersection in higher-dimensional space. The domain is considered weakly relational because the higher-dimensional relationships are induced by two-dimensional relationships over quad trees.

The paper delves into the representation of quad trees in terms of their two-dimensional projections and provides spatial definitions of domain operations that reduce to operations on each two-dimensional projection. Additionally, the paper discusses the handling of assignments in the quad tree domain and the importance of variable elimination in this approach.

The choice of widening is emphasized as crucial for the effective performance of a domain in an analysis. One suggested widening for quad trees involves increasing granularity as the number of iterations increases, formalized through a function associating an iterate with a granularity.

The paper also addresses the encoding of a quad tree as a Binary Decision Diagram (BDD) and the potential counter-models to describe regions not captured by the quad tree.

The work presented in the paper introduces a weakly relational domain analogous to finite powersets of intervals in relation to TVPI and polyhedra. The utilization of finite powersets of intervals has garnered recent attention, and further research into widenings for powerset domains and analysis across paths will be considered. Moreover, the paper highlights the application of quad trees in bounded model checking for electrical fields, diagnosing cardiac abnormalities, defining fractals using quad trees with back arcs, and their potential for dense representation akin to BDDs with back arcs.

The paper emphasizes the extensive literature on quad trees, including their generalization to higher dimensions (octrees) and diverse applications. The flexibility of quad trees to represent structures beyond square grids is noted, providing expressive freedom. Additionally, the paper suggests avenues for future work, including leveraging existing quad tree implementations for program analysis and investigating theoretical questions such as the optimality of the operators presented.

Finally, the paper acknowledges the contributions of various individuals and institutions to the research.
