This research introduces a methodology for the systematic development of Java Card smart card applications using the B method. The main objective of this approach is to abstract the specific details of Java Card and smart card aware applications as much as possible from the specifier. This allows for the specification of the application logic without being preoccupied with the platform-specific aspects, such as communication between the card acceptance device and the smart card itself. Platform-specific code can then be automatically generated during the refinement and code generation process. An interesting consequence of this approach is that the specification may be reused with any other platform of implementation.

In this paper, we present a specialized version of the B methodology aimed at enhancing productivity in the development of Java Card software. Previous work has demonstrated the potential to automatically generate Java Card code from B modules, but this approach was limited to the translation of language aspects and disregarded crucial elements of the Java Card platform, such as the communication between the host application and the applet running on the smart card. In this paper, we aim to provide B design guidelines specific to the Java Card framework, enabling the automation of part of the specification and implementation required to build the communication protocol between the card applet and the host application.

The structure of the paper is as follows. Sections 2 and 3 provide an overview of smart cards, Java Card, and the B method. The core contribution of the paper is presented in Section 4, which outlines the application of the B methodology to design Java Card components. Section 5 concludes the paper with related work and final remarks.

Smart cards, which resemble common magnetic-stripe cards but contain an integrated circuit with a microprocessor and memory, offer several advantages, including enhanced security in data processing and storage, increased storage capacity, and independence for remote database queries. Applications in industries such as telecommunications, finance, transportation, and healthcare can benefit from the use of smart cards due to their secure transaction mechanisms, secure user identification elements, and data storage features.

The ease of programming in Java, along with development tools such as IDEs, simulators, and emulators, facilitates rapid application development, testing, and installation, thereby reducing the time and cost of software production. Additionally, smart cards can accommodate multiple applications on the same card and are compatible with international standards such as ISO 7816.

A card acceptance device (CAD) serves as the interface between the host application and the smart card, providing power to the card and enabling communication between the host application and the card's application. Communication between these environments is facilitated through a half-duplexed protocol called Application Protocol Data Unit (APDU), which consists of a data package exchanged between the host application and the card application in a master-slave architecture.

In the context of Java Card, a Java Card applet is a class written in a subset of the Java language that inherits the javacard.framework.Applet class. This class defines variables and methods of an applet and is responsible for creating the applet, registering it in the Java Card runtime environment, and processing APDU messages received from the host application.

The B method consists of abstract specification and implementation levels, with a B module containing state space definitions and operations. The B integer variables must be restricted to the range of Java Card integer types (byte, short), and the int type is not supported in all Java Card implementations. The B notation provides specifications for Java Card-compliant data types and programming styles, including parameter data validation and exception handling.

The paper also discusses the translation of B interfaces to the Java Card style, the specification of the API exceptions machine, and the generation of a B abstract machine for implementation into the Java Card runtime environment. Additionally, the paper describes the API process for processing APDU commands and the API conversions for specifying encoding information of the application logic into bytes for manipulation in the Java Card platform.

In summary, this research proposes a methodology for the rigorous development of Java Card smart card applications using the B method, aiming to streamline the development process and improve productivity. The paper highlights the potential of abstracting platform-specific details and automating the generation of platform-specific code, ultimately increasing the reusability of specifications across different platforms.
