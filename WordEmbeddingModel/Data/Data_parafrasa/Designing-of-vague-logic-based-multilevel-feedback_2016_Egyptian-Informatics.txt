The multilevel feedback queue (MLFQ) scheduler faces several significant scheduling issues, including the problem of starvation for lengthy tasks, a fixed number of queues, and a static length of the time quantum in each queue, all of which directly affect the scheduler's performance. Moreover, there are instances of imprecision in task attributes that exacerbate the performance issues. This paper proposes a new scheduler, referred to as the VMLFQ scheduler, to address these challenges. The VMLFQ scheduler, which leverages vague set theory, intelligently handles imprecision, optimally determines the number of queues and the size of the time quantum for each queue, and resolves the issue of starvation. The paper conducts simulations and comparative analyses of the VMLFQ scheduler's performance using MATLAB.

The paper introduces the VMLFQ scheduler, which addresses the aforementioned issues associated with MLFQ scheduling and dynamically calculates the length of the time quantum for each queue, making the scheduler flexible and capable of making real-time decisions. The VMLFQ scheduler also enhances system performance in terms of average waiting time, average turnaround time, average normalized turnaround time, and average response time.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a brief explanation of task scheduling algorithms and MLFQ scheduling, including a discussion of related work on MLFQ. Section 3 presents background information on vague set theory. Section 4 details the VMLFQ scheduler, while Section 5 discusses simulations conducted with sample task sets and the obtained results. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper.

MLFQ scheduling, pioneered by Corbato et al. in 1962 with the Compatible Time Sharing System (CTSS), is a well-known scheduling approach for interactive systems. Similar to the multilevel queue, the multilevel feedback queue consists of multiple queues, each with a different priority. The highest priority task from the highest priority queue is scheduled first with the CPU. MLFQ allows tasks to be moved from one priority queue to another based on observed behavior, as the prioritization of each task is not static.

In the case of the VMLFQ scheduler, the length of the time quantum for each queue is dynamically determined to increase flexibility and enable real-time decision-making. This paper aims to handle uncertainty using vague set theory and presents the VMLFQ scheduler for comparative analysis with MLFQ and PMLFQ scheduling. The paper claims that the proposed VMLFQ scheduler outperforms existing approaches in terms of average waiting time, average response time, average normalized turnaround time, and average normalized turnaround time. 

Furthermore, the paper discusses the use of MATLAB for the design of the VMLFQ scheduler. It highlights the versatility of the VMLFQ scheduler in dynamically assigning the number of queues and the time quantum for each queue at runtime, handling task uncertainty and imprecision, as well as effectively resolving the starvation issue in lower priority queues through the consideration of response ratio, thus improving the overall system performance.
