Cancer is a collection of diseases characterized by uncontrolled growth, alteration, and proliferation of cells within the body. Typically, the name of a specific cancer corresponds to the location in the body where the abnormal cell growth originated. For example, breast cancer refers to the unregulated proliferation of cells in breast tissue, often resulting in the formation of a lump or mass of extra tissue known as a cancerous mass.

Decomposition methods involve segmenting the data and associated parameters into fixed-size sets, referred to as working sets. Optimization is performed on each working set while holding the other parameters constant, effectively executing coordinate descent on subsets of the parameters. The widely used software implementation SVMlight is an example of such an approach.

Gradient descent can be employed to address the primal support vector machine (SVM) optimization problem, leading to an iterative algorithm. The primary advantage of iterative methods is that they yield algorithms with fewer steps, making them straightforward to implement. However, a drawback is that they generally demonstrate linear convergence and are consequently slower than standard quadratic programming solvers.

Wave functions can be utilized to express particles instead of indicating their velocity and position. Simultaneously, in accordance with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, the velocity and position of particles cannot be accurately measured simultaneously. The likelihood of a particle's occurrence in a specific position at a given time can be represented by the probability density function of the corresponding wave function.

In the context of particle swarm optimization, the middle position of the particle swarm (Pbest) is denoted by Mbest, while Ppid represents a random point between Pid and Pgd. H is the sole parameter of the QPSO algorithm, commonly set to values such as 1.0, 0.5, maxiter, or t/maxiter 0.5.

Each classifier generated with the classifier is assessed using the sensitivity and specificity of the SVM classifier in distinguishing between cancer patients and non-cancer controls. SVM classifiers are constructed for various combinations of features until the classification accuracy reaches its maximum value. Estimates of classification accuracy are determined using the cross-validation method, which utilizes a validation dataset to evaluate the generalization error.

Particle swarm optimization entails the development of a MATLAB code to train SVM by PSO. The KKT conditions need to be met within an error threshold of 0.005 in order to swiftly identify an optimal solution, while the upper bound C is maintained at 100.0.
