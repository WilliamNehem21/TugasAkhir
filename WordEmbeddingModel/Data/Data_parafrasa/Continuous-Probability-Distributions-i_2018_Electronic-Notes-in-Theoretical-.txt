The authors present a model of concurrent games that incorporates probabilistic strategies supporting both discrete and continuous distributions. This model extends the probabilistic concurrent strategies introduced by Winskel, which were based on event structures. The authors start by introducing measurable event structures, which are discrete fibrations of event structures where each fiber is transformed into a measurable space. Subsequently, they construct a bicategory of measurable games and measurable strategies based on measurable event structures, and incorporate probability into measurable strategies using standard measure theory techniques. The authors demonstrate the model by providing semantics to an affine, higher-order probabilistic language with real numbers and continuous distributions.

Another application of game semantics is in probabilistic computation. As initially demonstrated by Danos and Harmer in a probabilistic version of the original Hyland-Ong game model, programs featuring random elements can be interpreted as probabilistic strategies carrying additional quantitative information. This approach is especially suitable for probabilistic programs with state, as the model is fully abstract for probabilistic Algol, an extension of PCF with reference ground types and probability.

The paper withholds discussion of probability until Section 4. The remainder of this section focuses on developing a framework for game semantics in a measurable setting, defining measurable strategies on measurable games, and describing their composition and organization as a bicategory.

The authors note the use of an operation on maps of ESPs (event structures with probabilities) and observe that this operation can be extended to maps of fibred and measurable ESPs. They also note that this operation is functorial and makes (MES,â¨‚,1) a symmetric monoidal category, where 1 denotes the empty measurable event structure.

As standard Borel, race-free ESPs are closed under various constructions of Section 3, a sub-bicategory of MG involving only such ESPs is recognized. Henceforth, the authors assume that all measurable ESPs are race-free and standard Borel, particularly relying on the property that in a standard Borel space, all singleton subsets are measurable. They then introduce valuations on discrete ESPs.

Furthermore, the authors aim to compare the probability of convergence of a closed term to that of its interpretation. The former was defined in Section 3.1, and the authors clarify the meaning of the probability of convergence of a ground type strategy.
