The use of multiformalism modeling has proven to be a valuable strategy for dealing with the complex constraints governing the specifications of computer-based systems. Multiformalism techniques aid modelers and designers by offering a more natural and convenient approach to the specification process and performance analysis. While their application may not inherently provide an advantage in solving the models, this paper demonstrates how a compositional multiformalism modeling approach can harness the power of product-form solutions to provide both efficient solutions and specifications for complex systems.

Techniques for analyzing state space-based models often encounter the state space explosion problem. Modularity has been explored in various ways in the literature to address this issue, suggesting that effective management of submodel composition can lead to efficient solutions. While simulation can serve as a useful tool, it may entail longer computing times. In many cases, efficient analytical solutions can be generated by leveraging specific characteristics of the composition structure or introducing appropriate techniques. Product-form solution techniques, for instance, offer known instances where the analysis of a complex model can be derived from analyzing its components.

This paper introduces a framework that integrates product-form solution theory with multiformalism compositional modeling techniques to create a modeling and analysis framework that provides modeling flexibility and efficient solutions. The framework encompasses the design and implementation of an extensible modeling and solution framework supported by a tool that encompasses multiformalism Markovian models and a threefold solution mechanism. The tool automatically verifies and executes a product-form solution; if unavailable, it provides a state space-based analytical solution or a simulation as a final resort. This research extends the Simthesys framework and demonstrates how product-form solution theory can be effectively combined with multiformalism models, enhancing the modeling flexibility and solution efficiency.

The proposed approach relies on the existing modularity in multiformalism models and uses the Simthesys framework to exploit the detection of Markov chains' product-form solutions in a multiformalism solution process. The Simthesys framework facilitates the design and development of user-defined formalisms, for which a proper multiformalism solver is automatically generated. In this paper, the solver generation is based on the analysis of the formalism description and a set of basic solving engines, including the use of Markov chain solving engines (analytical and simulative) along with a new solving engine that benefits from the Inap algorithm and the Marcat theorem.

The paper also presents the implementation of a queueing network semantic that reflects the occupation of queues, defining local, active, and passive events and incorporating mechanisms for considering the length of neighboring queues. Additionally, the paper outlines the implementation of Stochastic Petri Nets (SPNs), detailing their elements and behavior, as well as their connectivity with queuing network formalisms.

Furthermore, the paper proposes a formalism-independent cooperation scheme that facilitates synchronization among sub-models specified using different modeling languages, connecting the sub-models using cooperation arcs in the main model.

Finally, the paper presents a case study of a data stream processing system for detecting and monitoring seismic phenomena, outlining its structure and the use of product-form analytical solutions to derive operational parameters of the model.

Ultimately, the paper's contributions lie in its technique for identifying product-form solutions in a multiformalism framework, demonstrating the flexibility of generating state space and applying product form solutions to new formalisms without requiring the creation of new tools.
