As an intangible cultural heritage, traditional handicrafts play an important role in artistic education. However, the transmission and appreciation of traditional handicrafts can be challenging in modern teaching environments. To address this issue, this research explores the use of mixed reality (MR) technology to create a serious game for learning traditional handicrafts with a focus on mortise and tenon joints in traditional Chinese furniture.

Cultural heritage education has gained attention globally, and there is growing recognition of the need to strengthen cultural heritage education for young people. In China, educational policies have been introduced to promote the study of cultural heritage among college students. Traditional Chinese timber buildings are known for their mortise and tenon joints, which hold significant historical and cultural value and present challenges in terms of learning and understanding their intricate structures. This complexity can lead to a lack of interest in learning among students.

The study aims to investigate the potential of MR technology and serious games in teaching traditional handicrafts, specifically focusing on mortise and tenon joints. The research seeks to compare the effectiveness of MR-based serious games with conventional teaching methods in terms of knowledge retention, learning motivation, and situational interest.

Modern theories of effective learning highlight the importance of active, experiential, situational, and problem-based learning with immediate feedback. Serious games have been recognized as an effective medium for learning and are widely used in education due to their ability to make the learning process enjoyable and provide immediate feedback to learners.

Previous research has shown that serious games can effectively support cultural heritage education, offering potential for enhancing learning outcomes. However, there is a need for further exploration of the application of MR in cultural heritage education and its potential learning outcomes. This study aims to address this gap by evaluating the efficacy of using MR technology, particularly in the context of serious games, for cultural heritage education.

In the experiment, one group of students learned about mortise and tenon joints through an MR game, while the control group received traditional teaching. The study materials for both groups were designed to cover the same content, and the participants' knowledge learning, retention, situational interest, and motivation were evaluated.

The findings indicated that the MR group performed better in the basic knowledge component of the test, demonstrating higher knowledge retention in comparison to the traditional teaching group. However, there was no significant difference in the knowledge transfer component, suggesting that both teaching methods were equally effective in this aspect. The study also identified potential areas for improvement, such as the need to convey information more effectively in the MR game's picture part.

The use of MR serious games in cultural heritage education, particularly for learning about mortise and tenon joints, shows potential for improving knowledge acquisition and retention. Further research is needed to expand the content and elements of MR serious games and address limitations identified in this study.
