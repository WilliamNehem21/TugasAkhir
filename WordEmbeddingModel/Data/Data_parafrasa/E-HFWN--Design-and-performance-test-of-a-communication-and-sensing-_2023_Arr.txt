The term "communication and sensing integrated networks (CSINs)" refers to networks that can perceive physical digital space and facilitate intelligent communication simultaneously. These networks enable the cooperative communication and perception of multidimensional resources, as well as the intelligent interaction and processing of new information flows. This study introduces an enhanced CSIN technical architecture termed e-HFWN, explores its key technologies and performance indicators, and discusses air interface technology, which includes frame structure design, carrier aggregation, channel detection, physical skyline mapping, beamforming, management, and resource allocation. The proposed resource allocation scheme employs an actor-critic reinforcement learning (RL) framework to optimize wireless resource division, aiming to maximize mutual information (MI) and minimize end-to-end delay for sensing terminals. The performance of the e-HFWN is evaluated through numerical simulations of wireless resource management, system peak rate, capacity, end-to-end delay, and communication perception waveform sidelobe ratio. The results inform the enhancement of e-HFWN based on 5G mmWave. The improved sensing capabilities of the e-HFWN can provide valuable information for optimal and rapid scheduling of distributed computing power and for enhancing artificial intelligence (AI) services and applications. The paper also discusses the potential impact of e-HFWN on the development of 6G synaesthesia computing integrated networks and emphasizes the importance of aligning academia and industry for its advancement.

The research underscores the need for new network architectures and enabling technologies that can efficiently utilize resources and adapt to the diverse applications emerging beyond the 5G/6G era. It also highlights the significant impact of AI technologies, such as machine learning, RL, and neural networks, on communication network optimization and intelligent perception and control applications, contributing to the overall improvement of communication and sensing integration. The paper envisions that 6G, with integrated communication and sensing capabilities empowered by AI technology, will enable continuous and ubiquitous perception of the physical world, supporting intelligent cooperation and interaction between the digital and physical domains. This vision involves the ubiquitous interconnection of man-machine and objects, which will be further facilitated by AI services and applications using 6G CSIN.

The study introduces an AI RL method for communication and sensing channel resource allocation in the e-HFWN system. Specifically, an actor-critic RL framework is used to optimize wireless resource division, aiming to maximize the amount of MI and minimize the end-to-end delay for the perception terminal. The experimental platform testing of the e-HFWN system involves performance evaluation of communication and sensing, which includes RL simulations for communication perception channel resource allocation and testing of communication performance, such as peak rate, capacity, and end-to-end delay. The sensing performance of the e-HFWN system is also assessed, focusing on the calculation of the sidelobe ratio of communication and sensing waveforms. The study demonstrates the strong environmental sensing ability of the e-HFWN system.

The paper also discusses the integrated waveform design centered on communication and its function in perception. It highlights the importance of constant envelope waveform design, which enables the transmission of signals with maximum available power budget without signal distortion. The integrated waveform design scheme based on cellular mobile and Wi-Fi networks combines orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) and frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) waveforms to enhance endogenous sensing resolution and accuracy performance. Furthermore, it addresses the challenge of network resource congestion and interference in future smart factories, emphasizing the need for optimizing various indicators through resource allocation for dense terminal access, target positioning performance, and subcarrier power allocation.

The paper also elaborates on the construction and testing of the experimental platform for the e-HFWN system, focusing on communication and sensing. It highlights the use of the actor-critic deep RL algorithm for communication-sensing resource allocation to improve system throughput. Special attention is given to the time division design of the e-HFWN, which divides time into protected windows, unprotected windows, and guards to optimize the time slots for service flows and minimize interference.
