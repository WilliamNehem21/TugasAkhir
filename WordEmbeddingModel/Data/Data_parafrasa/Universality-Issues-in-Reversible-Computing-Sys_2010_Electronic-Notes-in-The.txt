This survey examines the construction of a universal computer within a reversible environment, considering reversible turing machines, reversible logic circuits, and reversible cellular automata. The study shows that despite the constraint of reversibility, there are simple reversible systems capable of universal computing.

Given the fundamental nature of reversibility as a microscopic physical law, it is crucial to explore the efficient implementation of universal computers in systems exhibiting this property, especially with the increasing miniaturization of computing devices. The survey delves into universality issues in such systems, particularly focusing on reversible turing machines, reversible logic circuits, and reversible cellular automata. It reveals that even the simplest reversible systems can exhibit universal computing abilities, operating differently from conventional computing systems and introducing new concepts for future computing.

A reversible logic element serves as the building block for reversible logic circuits, functioning through a one-to-one mapping. This element can be memoryless, referred to as a reversible logic gate, or incorporate memory. Early research on reversible gates was carried out by Petri, and later studies by Toffoli and Fredkin explored their connection with physical reversibility. Among various reversible logic gates, the Toffoli gate and the Fredkin gate are extensively studied and known to be logically universal.

The billiard ball model (BBM) proposed by Fredkin and Toffoli offers a reversible physical model of computing, consisting of idealized mechanical components like balls and reflectors. Fredkin and Toffoli demonstrated the realization of the Fredkin gate within the BBM.

Nevertheless, traditional methods make it challenging to design a reversible cellular automaton (RCA) using conventional cellular automata. Several frameworks have been proposed to address this issue, including cellular automata with block rules, partitioned cellular automata, and cellular automata with second-order rules.

It has been established that the local function of a partitioned cellular automaton is one-to-one if and only if its global function is one-to-one. Additionally, partitioned cellular automata are a subset of traditional cellular automata. Therefore, constructing a partitioned cellular automaton with a one-to-one local function is sufficient for achieving an RCA.

The survey also highlights the construction of a universal model using a 2-state cellular automaton with block rules, as well as the development of a universal 8-state triangular RCA within the framework of partitioned cellular automata. In this model, each triangular cell features three parts with two states and an extremely simple local function.

Overall, the survey demonstrates that reversible systems can be computation-universal, showcasing their full computing power despite the stringent constraint of reversibility. It further emphasizes that universal computing systems can be composed of very simple primitives, such as 2-state reversible logic elements or reversible local functions of partitioned cellular automata.
