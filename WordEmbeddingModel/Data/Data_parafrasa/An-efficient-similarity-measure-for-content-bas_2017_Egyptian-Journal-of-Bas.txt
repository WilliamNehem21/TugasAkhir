Das et al. presented a technique for feature extraction by binarizing images in order to improve image retrieval and identification using content-based image recognition. The authors evaluated their system using two public datasets consisting of 3688 images and found that their method reduced the feature size to 12, regardless of the image dimensions. Statistical measures based on precision and recall were used for evaluation. However, one drawback of this approach is the potential misclassification of query images, which could impact retrieval performance compared to other existing methods.

Feng et al. introduced a global correlation descriptor for extracting texture and color features to have an equal influence on content-based image retrieval. They also proposed global correlation vector and directional global correlation vector to describe texture and color features by integrating structure element correlation and histogram statistics. The validation was conducted using Corel-10K and Corel-5K datasets, and the efficiency was evaluated based on recall and precision.

Zeng et al. proposed a local structure descriptor for image retrieval that combines color, shape, and texture as a single unit for retrieving images. They also introduced an algorithm for feature extraction capable of extracting local structure histogram using the local structure descriptor.

Madhavi et al. devised an approach called image retrieval using interactive genetic algorithm, which involves calculating a large number of selective features and comparing related images based on these features. The approach was tested on a dataset of 10,000 images to demonstrate its effectiveness.

Ali et al. presented a content-based image retrieval approach by integrating speeded-up robust features (SURF) and scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT). The representation of these local features was used for retrieval, with SIFT being robust to rotation and scale changes, and SURF being more robust to illumination changes. The approach was evaluated on Corel-1500, Corel-2000, and Corel-1000 datasets.

The genetic algorithm (GA) is a widely used meta-heuristic in optimization problems, as it simulates heredity in living organisms and is effective in finding optimal solutions within a search space. The great deluge algorithm, when integrated into the genetic algorithm, can improve the efficiency of finding solutions.

Color feature extraction is crucial for image retrieval, especially in large image databases. However, color features are influenced by non-surface characteristics such as illumination and device-specific properties. Similarly, shape feature extraction aims to capture the shape properties of image items, allowing for easier storing, transmitting, comparing, and recognizing of shapes.

In the context of image processing, the median filter is used as a preprocessing step to reduce noise and has the property of preserving edges. Additionally, the Canny edge detection method is employed for extracting shape features, which provide numerical information about the image and are invariant to changes in size, direction, and position of objects within the image.

In the genetic algorithm, candidate solutions' fitness is computed within an initial population, and then selection mechanisms, crossover, and mutation operations are used to generate offspring solutions until a stopping criterion is met. A local search algorithm can be applied to improve a solution obtained from the genetic algorithm before moving to the next generation, thus speeding up the convergence of the genetic algorithm.

The great deluge algorithm (GDA) is utilized to improve the quality of solutions in the genetic search process and enhance the exploitation process during the search, serving as a local search algorithm. It aims to elevate the fitness number to improve the quality of solutions in the search process.
