Stochastic models such as generalized semi-Markov processes have been widely used, but they lack the ability to model concurrency aspects effectively and lack mechanisms for compositional specification, making the models of larger systems overly complex.

Several formalisms for analyzing performance and concurrency aspects have been developed, such as stochastic Petri nets and stochastic process algebras. These formalisms provide mechanisms for modeling concurrency and performance aspects, but they often result in low-level models.

In this paper, we propose a new model called generalized stochastic graph transformation systems to model and analyze architectural evolution with non-exponential time distributions. This model employs timed events to represent concurrent execution of events and is well-suited for modeling concurrency, architectural, and stochastic aspects.

While stochastic modeling is useful for system analysis, the more general the modeling approach, the more challenging the analysis becomes. The paper discusses the limitations of existing model checkers, such as PRISM, for analyzing more general stochastic processes and presents the need for more sophisticated analysis techniques.

The paper is organized into sections that explain the need for general distributions, present the underlying notion of generalized semi-Markov processes, define the new model called generalized stochastic graph transformation system, describe how Monte Carlo simulation techniques can be used, and conclude with future research directions.

The paper proposes using general distributions to generalize the notion of continuous time Markov chains and discusses the operational semantics of the model, which is defined by mapping a generalized semi-Markov process to a stochastic automaton.

The semantics of a stochastic graph transformation system is explained, and the event scheduling scheme proposed in a previous work is discussed. Visual modeling of stochastic graph transformation systems is described, along with strategies for estimating system properties using stochastic simulation techniques, both for long-run behavior and transient analysis.

The paper also outlines future research directions, including the development of a tool for stochastic graph transformation with general distributions, investigating the applicability of database management systems, and studying the mix of stochastic and deterministic behavior in systems.
