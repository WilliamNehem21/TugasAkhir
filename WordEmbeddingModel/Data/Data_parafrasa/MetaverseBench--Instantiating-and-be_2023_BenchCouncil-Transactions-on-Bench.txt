One one hand, significant progress has been made in developing the metaverse through technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, and extended reality. Specifically, advancements in artificial intelligence, particularly in deep learning and reinforcement learning, have played a crucial role in the development of the metaverse. The rise of blockchain technology has introduced decentralization as a key feature of the metaverse, while improvements in devices and wearable technologies have increased public interest in virtual and augmented reality. On the other hand, the global COVID-19 pandemic has led to explosive growth in online industries, including online education, with analysts estimating a market size of $210.1 billion in 2021. This growth has not only driven the development of relevant technologies but has also promoted the evolution of the metaverse.

Existing benchmarks focus on specific technological domains, but given the interdisciplinary nature of the metaverse and the entanglement of various technologies, there is a need for a benchmark suite that can quantitatively define the challenges of the metaverse system and evaluate state-of-the-art and state-of-practice solutions. In this study, the authors propose a comprehensive conceptual system for the metaverse, encompassing its components, technological domains, and specifications. Additionally, they present a methodology for benchmarking the metaverse system and introduce an implementation of a benchmark suite called metaversebench.

The conceptual system proposed by the authors includes the fundamental components of the metaverse, nine relevant technological domains, and five specifications that the metaverse should adhere to. The benchmarking methodology combines the conceptual system with a scenario-based approach, involving the construction of a typical metaverse application scenario and the selection of representative workloads based on the identified technological domains.

The study reviews representative definitions of the metaverse, presents the conceptual system, methodology for benchmarking metaverse systems, and introduces metaversebench. The authors recognize the need for a comprehensive conceptual system that covers all aspects of the metaverse and propose a system that encompasses its components, technological domains, and specifications.

The authors also discuss the essential concepts of realism, ubiquity, interoperability, and scalability that enable the metaverse. Furthermore, they delve into the contributions of artificial intelligence and big data in realizing the metaverse and emphasize the importance of data security and privacy, network connectivity, autonomic computing, immersive experience, decentralized architecture, ubiquitous access, and hyperspace interaction in the metaverse context.

In the education sector, the metaverse scenario offers immersive learning experiences that go beyond traditional classroom settings, enabling students to explore historical landmarks, visit foreign countries, and participate in simulated experiments.

The study proposes a process for determining workloads, which involves selecting representative workloads from the identified technological domains and mapping them to general metaverse scenarios. Additionally, the authors discuss the challenges in benchmark construction and outline their plans to build the metaverse benchmark suite.

Overall, the study provides a comprehensive conceptual system for the metaverse and proposes a methodology and benchmark suite to systematically assess the metaverse system and evaluate its technological capabilities. The authors acknowledge the existing benchmarks for related technological domains but emphasize the need for benchmarks specifically tailored to complete metaverse systems.
