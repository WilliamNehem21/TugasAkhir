The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 formally describes the Boucherie compositional framework and provides an illustrative example that will be referenced throughout the paper. Section 3 briefly introduces the CSL logic and proves compositional verification for a subset of it. Section 4 discusses the advantages obtained by applying the proposed approach. Finally, Section 5 summarizes the work presented in this paper and outlines directions for future research.

The state-space S of the composed CTMC M is straightforwardly obtained from equation (2.1). States corresponding to a breach of the mutually exclusive condition are those in which at least two philosophers use the resource eat or at least one of the forks is used by the two adjacent philosophers.

In the following, we introduce the concept of a k-move and derive its probability (Lemma 3.1). A transition q(s, s') is referred to as a k-move if it corresponds to a change of state of component k. The probability of observing a k-move in state s = (s1, ..., sk, ..., sk) is denoted as pk(s) and is given by a specific expression.

Throughout the rest of this section, we demonstrate that in several instances it is possible to determine in a compositional manner whether a given state of the composed process satisfies a state formula or not. The types of formulae considered are single-component until formulae (discussed in Section 3.1), single-component next formulae (discussed in Section 3.2), and global next formulae (discussed in Section 3.3).

Theorem 3.2 intuitively holds because in a Boucherie process, a component can block another for a specified duration but cannot alter the way the other component selects its next state. A formal proof is provided in the appendix.

The aforementioned result indicates that reasoning about temporal next properties in a Boucherie framework can be approached in a decomposed manner. Specifically, the verification of a single-component next formula bounded by i against M essentially reduces (in the worst case) to the verification of the same next formula with a shifted bounding interval i'. This time-shift can be understood as a (stochastic) compensation for decreased concurrency, as the focus of attention moves from a state (s1, ..., sk) of M to its projection sk on Mk.

The state space of the model can be partitioned into macrostates, each characterized by the current resource usage of the components reflected in a vector |r1, ..., rk|, where rj= 0 if component j does not use any shared resource and rj > 0 indicates that resource rj is in use by component j.

The level of competition, denoted as C, of the framework depends on the number of shared resources (i) and the distribution of competition among them (i.e., the sets aki). The larger the level of competition of a framework, the greater the gain.

Furthermore, it is established that the next state of component k after the first k-move does not depend on the state of the other components. Moreover, the distribution of the next state of component k in the composed CTMC is identical to the distribution of the next state in the single CTMC, which confirms the stated theorem.
