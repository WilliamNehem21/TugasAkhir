Identifying potential threats at an early stage presents a significant challenge for policymakers and practitioners. When examining cyber strategies, it provides an ideal opportunity to observe how organizations, particularly governments, struggle to meet the expectations of their stakeholders within the context of alliances, cooperativeness, socio-demographic values, and other practical influences.

Interventions and retaliatory actions need to include explicit predictions about the relationship between processes, tactical courses of action, and desired outcomes, such as minimizing threats, validating enforced mechanisms, and introducing strike back mechanisms.

This work focuses on assessing the effectiveness of existing efforts and practices in major industries, like telecommunications, transportation, and electricity, towards cyber security research. The analysis draws from available roadmaps and data sets, as government-restricted classified information may not be accessible.

It is crucial to select industries, such as academe, governments, and private financial sectors, and provide an assessment period that represents the current cybersecurity research priorities. The study focuses on organizations across the US, UK, and Asia Pacific, particularly those recently targeted by cyber attacks. The research uses data from identified organizations with regional presence in the UK, US, and Asia, and emphasizes a recent survey on risks and threats in cloud computing.

To effectively respond to suspected cyber threats, it is important to identify and differentiate cyber attacks from localized attacks, assess their impact, and act according to existing courses of action.

Observations of recent cases reveal the lack of effective strategies, technologies, and resources for carrying out effective cybersecurity, emphasizing the need for dynamic multi-way interactions and intelligence sharing among stakeholders.

The development of conceptual frameworks to detect cyber threats has been influenced by trends in specific regions where threats have occurred. Longitudinal studies across industries can assist in creating methods to quickly identify, validate, and resolve cyber threats.

Engaging in alliances that encourage participation and interaction can help raise awareness and develop feasible approaches for addressing cyber threats. However, some organizations may have limited opportunities to forge such alliances.
