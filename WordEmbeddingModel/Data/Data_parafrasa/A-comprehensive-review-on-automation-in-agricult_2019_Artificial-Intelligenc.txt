The focus on automation in agriculture is a pressing and emerging topic worldwide, driven by the rapid growth of the global population and the resulting increased demand for food. Traditional farming methods have proven insufficient in meeting this escalating demand, leading to excessive soil degradation from the intensified use of harmful pesticides. To address these challenges, various automation technologies such as IoT, wireless communications, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and deep learning are being explored to revolutionize agricultural practices. These technologies offer promising solutions to existing issues in crop diseases, storage management, pesticide control, weed management, and irrigation and water management. It is imperative to address concerns such as the use of harmful pesticides, controlled irrigation, pollution control, and environmental impact on agricultural practices. Adoption of automated farming practices has shown potential to not only improve soil productivity but also enhance soil fertility.

In the current digital era, the convergence of human cognition and artificial intelligence has given rise to an entirely new field known as artificial intelligence (AI). As part of computer science, AI aims to create intelligent machines that can perceive their environment and make decisions to maximize success, leveraging past learning experiences. AI encompasses various domains such as deep learning, convolutional neural networks (CNN), artificial neural networks (ANN), and machine learning, which enhance machine capabilities and drive technological advancements.

This paper delves into the integration of embedded systems and AI within the agriculture sector. The implementation of AI and expert systems in agriculture constitutes a niche area of study that has garnered attention since the 1980s. With the global population continuously on the rise, countries like South Korea, China, and North America are heavily investing in agricultural advancements and integrating advanced technologies. India, in particular, plays a significant role in the cultivation of food crops and is a vital sector within its economy. The acceleration of automation in agriculture is crucial to cope with the mounting pressure on the sector resulting from the burgeoning human population.

The continuous expansion of human population is increasing pressure on the agriculture sector, emphasizing the significance of agri-technology and precision farming in the modern world. Digital agriculture, which harnesses advanced computer systems to calculate parameters like weed detection, crop prediction, yield detection, and crop quality through machine learning techniques, is gaining prominence. The paper explores diverse applications of ANN, ML, and IoT in agriculture and outlines several models that facilitate precision farming.

Notably, artificial neural networks have been frequently integrated into the agriculture sector due to their advantages over traditional systems, particularly their capability to predict and forecast based on parallel reasoning. Researchers have employed neural networks to distinguish between weeds and crops, forecast water resource variables, and develop crop growth models. In addition, expert systems based on fuzzy logic have been developed to provide guidance for soybean cultivation, gathering knowledge from agricultural officers, literature, and crop experts.

Furthermore, various AI-based systems have been employed to estimate soil moisture in paddy fields, predict spatial water distribution in subsurface drip irrigation systems, and analyze yield in maize crops. The integration of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in precision agriculture holds the potential to significantly enhance agricultural production, precision irrigation, and reduce operational costs. Additionally, advancements in embedded intelligence (EI) have contributed to the development of smart farming, smart crop management, smart irrigation, and smart greenhouses, presenting transformative opportunities for the agriculture sector.

The emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) has introduced a new paradigm in agriculture, enabling the networked transfer of data among devices without human intervention. IoT plays a pivotal role in facilitating smart farming, enabling the deployment of precision irrigation and crop management strategies. The paper emphasizes the significance of understanding networking standards such as Bluetooth, Zigbee, and IPv6, as well as hardware systems for establishing WSNs. It also details the development of smart devices such as GPS-based remote-controlled robots for tasks like weeding and spraying, smart irrigation systems, and smart warehouse management systems.

Moreover, the paper discusses the application of regional convolutional neural networks (R-CNN) in fruit detection and counting within orchards, as well as the use of sensor-based systems for smart irrigation to optimize water usage. Integrated systems incorporating soil moisture sensors, nitrogen sensors, and wireless communication technologies have been developed to enhance irrigation systems and automate pest control processes.

In summary, the paper conveys the urgent need for automation in the agriculture sector to address the mounting demands for food production and sustainability. The amalgamation of advanced technologies, including AI, IoT, and WSNs, offers tremendous potential to revolutionize agricultural practices and enhance productivity while minimizing human intervention and resource usage. The manuscript encompasses a comprehensive overview of diverse emerging technologies and their applications in agriculture, providing valuable insights into the evolving landscape of agri-automation.
