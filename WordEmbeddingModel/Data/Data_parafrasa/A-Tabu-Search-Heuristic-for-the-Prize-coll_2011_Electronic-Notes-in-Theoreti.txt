I propose a heuristic approach based on tabu search to generate feasible solutions for addressing the prize-collecting rural postman problem (PRPP), which has been recently introduced as a generalization of other arc routing problems. Through a series of computational experiments using various instances, the numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm compared to previous methods.

In the PRPP, providing service to an edge incurs both a cost and a profit. The cost is associated with traversing the edge, while the profit stems from providing service to the edge. When considering a cycle, the cumulative cost of traversing all edges is taken into account, allowing for the possibility of edges being traversed multiple times. A reward is earned only when an edge is traversed for the first time within a route. The primary objective of the PRPP is to find a route that commences and concludes at the depot, maximizing the aggregate profit from serving the edges while minimizing the cost of traversal.

The PRPP holds potential practical applications in addressing arc routing problems aimed at cost minimization. It is used when service demands are specific to certain locations, focusing on determining the least expensive way to traverse them. The PRPP can model complex practical problems, such as scenarios where a company seeks to maximize profits by only serving edges that provide a benefit, as seen in the collection of recycling bins by private companies or in mail services managed by private companies. Given the success of tabu search in various arc routing problems, it is adopted as the foundational metaheuristic for solving the PRPP.

The algorithm I have developed is based on tabu search and consists of two phases. The first phase involves generating two feasible solutions for the PRPP using two constructive algorithms: the union of connected components and the successive elimination of connected components. Subsequently, the second phase employs a tabu search algorithm to enhance the initial solutions.

During the tabu search iteration, the solution from the first algorithm, union of connected components, can be utilized to diversify the search if necessary. The algorithm then proceeds with the iteration. In lines 20 and 21, edges associated with PRPP properties, known as dominance 2 and preprocessing 1, are identified. The algorithm aims to promote the inclusion of edges in the feasible solution if they belong to the optimal solution, while attempting to avoid including certain edges in the feasible solution to improve the search. If a better global solution is not found after a specified number of iterations, the algorithm will diversify the search in a completely different state space or intensify the search by selecting a different feasible solution obtained randomly.

The algorithm was evaluated on various instances, demonstrating improved performance over previous methods. Specifically, it outperformed the tabu search in the g64 and g100 problems, and achieved the optimal solution in 12 out of 15 problem types. While the computation time for the tabu search was higher for smaller instances, it was significantly lower for larger problems. The computational effort of the tabu search was deemed satisfactory when considering the total time expended by both heuristics.
