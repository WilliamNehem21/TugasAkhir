This academic paper addresses the challenge of dealing with uncertain customer demand in a facility location problem. The authors propose a two-stage distributionally robust model to optimize the facility locations and operational decisions while accounting for incomplete information about the uncertainty distribution. The model uses moment information to construct a set of distributions and bases the optimal decisions on the worst distribution in the set to hedge against risks arising from incomplete information.

The paper presents two numerical approaches for solving the distributionally robust facility location problem: a semi-infinite programming approach that exploits moments of reference random variables and a semi-definite programming approach that uses the mean and correlation of the underlying random variables describing demand uncertainty. The authors provide numerical tests to demonstrate the computational properties of the robust solutions.

While the paper shares similarities with existing models in terms of single-period planning, single product and facility type, and deterministic parameters, it highlights the limitation of the deterministic assumption in real-world problems. The strategic decisions on facility setup are often capital-intensive, non-repetitive, and extend over a long time horizon, making them subject to risks arising from uncertainties in demands and operations. The need to hedge against these risks becomes a crucial aspect of the decision-making process.

The paper discusses two major frameworks used to model uncertainty in facility location problems: stochastic optimization and robust optimization. The stochastic optimization approach assumes complete information on the uncertainty distribution, while the robust optimization framework does not make any assumptions about the probability distribution of the uncertainty.

The paper then delves into discussions on numerical schemes for solving the robust model, including a semi-definite programming (SDP) scheme and a semi-infinite programming (SIP) scheme, each tailored to the availability of information on the distribution of demands.

Furthermore, the paper explores the use of conditional value at risk (CVaR) as a means to approximate the semi-infinite constraints and discusses the advantages of using this method, citing previous studies for reference.

The authors also present a discretization scheme that has been applied to a distributionally robust formulation of a two-stage stochastic unit commitment problem, demonstrating its potential effectiveness in approximation.

The paper concludes with a comparison of deterministic and robust solutions, showing that the robust solutions offer greater flexibility and robustness against uncertainty at the expense of increased total expected cost. The numerical tests demonstrate the performance of the proposed numerical methods for small and medium-sized instances.

In terms of future research, the paper suggests studying the extension of the proposed methodologies to include uncertainty in supply, multistage problems, and market competition. Additionally, the authors aim to enhance the solution algorithms for larger-scale instances and apply the proposed methodologies to practical problems with similar characteristics, such as uncertain supply and demand in the energy industry.

Overall, the paper presents a comprehensive investigation of distributionally robust facility location problems and proposes numerical methods to address the challenges associated with uncertain customer demand. It also outlines potential avenues for future research in this area.
