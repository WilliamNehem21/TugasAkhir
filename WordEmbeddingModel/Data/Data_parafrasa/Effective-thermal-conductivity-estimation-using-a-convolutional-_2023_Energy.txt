This academic paper demonstrates the use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) in topology optimization to predict effective thermal conductivity. The CNN model achieves an accuracy within a range of 0.67% to 11.8% for various cases and is successful in predicting trends in effective thermal conductivity and improving the structure to closely approach theoretical maximum values in all cases.

Heterogeneous materials play a crucial role in various fields of science and engineering due to their inherent mechanical and transport properties. In energy research, properties related to material geometry, orientation, and topology are integral to overall system performance. The distribution of phases within the material significantly impacts physical and structural properties such as effective diffusivity, permeability, and effective thermal conductivity, making accurate prediction of these properties important.

While numerous analytical and empirical models exist to predict effective thermal conductivity, they often rely on simplified geometries and have limited ranges of validity, covering only specific subsets of topology and porosity. Experimental or simulation-based predictions are time-consuming and costly. To address these challenges, a random-walk-based model is proposed as an alternative method for efficiently obtaining effective thermal conductivity and effective diffusivity. This approach provides faster computations for 2D or 3D domains and outperforms conventional numerical heat transfer models and empirical models in terms of both speed and accuracy.

In the context of energy research, previous studies have explored the use of CNN architectures, such as AlexNet and ResNet, to predict the effective diffusivity of porous media solely from images. However, the accuracy of these models has been limited due to the relatively small training datasets. Another study employed a CNN along with other machine learning methods to predict the effective thermal conductivity of composite materials and porous media, achieving high accuracy.

This paper builds on these previous studies and uses recent advancements in training CNNs and parameter optimization to propose a CNN-based model for predicting effective thermal conductivity. The authors thoroughly analyze the factors affecting the accuracy of the CNN model, including the CNN architecture, hyperparameter selection, dataset size, and training schedule, while also considering prediction speed. The CNN model's accuracy is validated using structures with analytical results and data outside the training dataset to ensure its effectiveness across a diverse range of 2D structures. The authors emphasize the speed, accuracy, and generalizability of the CNN-based model, inspired by VGG-class networks, and demonstrate its ability to make predictions on new data within milliseconds.

To support the development of the CNN model, a dataset comprising over 130,000 images and their simulated thermal conductivities is created using a central-differencing based numerical heat transfer (NHT) model. The simulations are performed using resources from high-performance computing facilities, such as the Bridges2 supercomputer and the Expanse supercomputer.

In addition to predicting material properties, the study aims to assess the applicability of the CNN predictive model in iterative topology optimization problems. By leveraging the efficiency and accuracy of the CNN model, the computational time for topology optimization can be significantly reduced, enabling larger domains and more complex cost functions. The authors demonstrate the importance of prediction accuracy in the success of topology optimization and highlight the potential of the CNN model in addressing computational challenges in this context.

The paper also discusses the architecture and hyperparameter optimization of the CNN model, investigation of potential sources of error, prediction speed in different environments, and validation using test cases from analytical solutions. Furthermore, the trained CNN models are applied to test cases in topology optimization to demonstrate practical applications of the model.

One important aspect of the study is the generation of a diverse and expansive training dataset, which is made openly accessible to encourage contribution from other researchers and improve the generalizability of the CNN model. The paper addresses the choice of CNN architecture and the impact of network depth, number of nodes, and different models on prediction accuracy and consistency.

The application of the CNN model in iterative topology optimization and the consideration of real-world scenarios outside the training dataset highlights the potential of the CNN model in practical applications. However, the paper acknowledges the limitations of the CNN model, such as its lack of understanding of physical principles, and suggests areas for future research to improve the model's accuracy and applicability.
