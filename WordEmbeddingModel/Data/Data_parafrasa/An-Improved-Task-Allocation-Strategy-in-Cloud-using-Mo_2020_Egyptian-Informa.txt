The study indicates that certain tasks within a system require immediate attention due to their time sensitivity or inability to be sustained over time. Therefore, prioritizing these tasks becomes crucial for effective scheduling strategies. Ghanbari et al. introduced a priority-based job scheduling technique (PJSC) that considers job priority as a primary constraint, utilizing the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) as its underlying concept. By incorporating multiple attributes, complexity, and finish time, the proposed algorithm aims to minimize the makespan time, with the potential to further improve by considering additional quality of service (QoS) parameters for scheduling.

While priority scheduling based on quality of service (QoS) parameters is a widely used conventional approach, statically assigning priority to tasks can lead to various issues. Xiao et al. proposed a priority-based strategy to address these challenges and highlighted its superiority over the First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) technique. Additionally, they suggested negotiating waiting time as a form of credit for others, emphasizing the need for further exploration and utilization of this strategy. To address shortcomings in fair queuing scheduling algorithms, Yang et al. presented the Class-Based Weighted Fair Scheduling (CBWFQ) technique, which aims to enhance network performance, reduce time delay, and ensure fairness, particularly in real-time applications.

Lakra et al. outlined a multi-objective approach for datacenter task allocation, emphasizing the importance of prioritizing tasks based on quality of service (QoS) criteria. Their algorithm assigns higher priority to lower QoS jobs and vice versa, with a focus on minimizing task execution time. The authors suggested the potential for further refinement through improved virtual machine and task categorization techniques and the incorporation of additional QoS factors. This approach was simulated using the CloudSim simulator.

The paper highlights the importance of task credit allocation based on task length values and outlines a procedure for effectively scheduling tasks. It further delves into the experimental setup and proposed work, offering insight into the necessary arrangements, simulation results, conclusion, and future scope of the research.

The selection of simulators for cloud computing research depends on the nature of the study, with several options available, each tailored to specific research needs. CloudSim is recommended as a versatile simulator for various research issues in the cloud environment due to its features and popularity.

Notably, the proposed system showed significant improvements in makespan time, memory allocation, and network operations compared to the existing system. The results underscored the potential for efficiency gains and performance enhancements in cloud computing systems through innovative scheduling algorithms and load balancing techniques. However, the need for further research in load balancing techniques and the incorporation of additional quality of service parameters was also emphasized.

Additionally, the paper provides background information on the researchers involved in the study, shedding light on their qualifications and professional experience.
