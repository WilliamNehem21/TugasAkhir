The rapid increase in population is a significant challenge confronting Egypt, as its population growth rates outpace its economic growth rates. This presents various problems common to many developing nations, including the proliferation of slum communities and the associated social and economic repercussions. A 2012 report highlighted population growth and the spread of slum settlements as the most pressing challenges facing Egypt.

Another study utilized longitudinal data to investigate changes in time-dependent public health and biomedical science variables. Multilevel structural equation modeling (MSEM) was employed to analyze quantitative and continuous data. The model featured two levels: the first level examined changes in time-dependent properties of individuals, while the second level focused on properties that remained constant over time. The study also utilized a model with fixed and nonlinear shared variables for latent variables and missing data. The maximum potential method was used to estimate the model parameters, yielding satisfactory results.

Assessing the quality of reconciling MSEM across all levels is complicated by several issues, such as determining the level responsible for poor conciliation and the challenge of adjusting upper levels given the small sample size. Therefore, this work conducted separate analyses at each level to conduct statistical tests before estimating the MSEM and the MSEM with constants and a random slope. The study investigated fertility determinants in the Arab Republic of Egypt due to its high reproduction rate, particularly in Giza Governorate. It also considered the impact of slum communities on fertility rates, particularly in rural, urban, and random geographical areas.

The uneven distribution of the population, with most of it concentrated in the capital and along the narrow strip around the Nile River, places immense pressure on resources and infrastructure. The remaining areas of Egypt are underdeveloped, presenting a costly challenge for the government to address due to its neglect.

Furthermore, a two-level analysis considered the variables at the first level as two-sided variables, while treating the same variables at the second level as continuous measures of service availability through clustering. Relationships between first-level variables and fertility determinants depicted differences in family fertility at the second level based on groupings. The model was estimated with random constants and a random slope using the maximum likelihood method with robust standard errors through numerical integration.
