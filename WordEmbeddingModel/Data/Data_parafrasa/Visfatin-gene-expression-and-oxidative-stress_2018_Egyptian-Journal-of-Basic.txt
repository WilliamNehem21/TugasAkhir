The specific causes of preeclampsia are not fully understood, but certain factors such as first pregnancy, a history of preeclampsia, and multiple gestations can increase the risk. Additionally, preexisting conditions like obesity, diabetes mellitus, insulin resistance, chronic hypertension, gestational diabetes, lupus, vascular or connective tissue disorders, and chronic kidney disease may also elevate the risk of preeclampsia. High blood pressure during pregnancy is categorized into four groups according to the recommendations of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program Working Group on High Blood Pressure in Pregnancy, including chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension, mild and severe preeclampsia, and preeclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension. Gestational hypertension and preeclampsia can typically be diagnosed by measuring high blood pressure and proteinuria. Additionally, oxidative stress is thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia, potentially leading to tissue damage. An adaptive mechanism that promotes the antioxidant defense system in pregnant women can counter the effects of reactive oxygen species. However, an imbalance between lipid peroxidation products and antioxidant enzyme defense mechanisms may contribute to the pathogenesis of preeclampsia.

The study used the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 16.0 for data analysis, showing preserved normality. Mean and standard deviation were used to describe central tendency and dispersion, and differences between two groups in quantitative parameters were assessed using the independent t-test with significance set at p<.05. The correlation between quantitative parameters was evaluated using Pearson correlation, with correlations considered significant at p<.05.

Problems in the regulation of adipokines may be involved in the pathophysiology of insulin resistance, obesity, dyslipidemia, and the metabolic syndrome, all of which are implicated in preeclampsia. The study found a decrease in placental visfatin gene expression levels in all hypertensive pregnant women groups compared to normotensive pregnant women.

Preeclampsia is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease later in life, and both conditions share common factors such as inflammation, insulin resistance, and obesity. Elevated levels of visfatin in metabolic syndrome led the authors to propose that nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (nampt) may contribute to preeclampsia. Some studies reported increased levels of serum visfatin in preeclamptic pregnant women, while others proposed that the expression of visfatin was decreased, possibly related to its role as a proangiogenic factor. Studies also showed decreased plasma nampt levels in mild and severe preeclampsia and decreased expression of visfatin in placental biopsies from preeclamptic pregnancies.

In preeclamptic patients, dysfunction and elevated blood pressure are associated with decreased catalase activity, total antioxidant capacity, and reduced glutathione levels compared to normotensive individuals. This reduction in antioxidants in preeclampsia may be due to increased attack by free radicals and subsequent low production of antioxidants. Conversely, some studies have reported an increase in antioxidants.

Lipid peroxidation is a major factor leading to oxidative stress and the etiopathogenesis of preeclampsia. The study found increased malondialdehyde levels in hypertensive pregnant women compared to normotensive pregnant women. Products of lipid peroxidation are believed to mediate the disturbance of maternal vascular endothelium, inhibit prostacyclin synthesis, and stimulate smooth muscle contraction, contributing to the widespread vasospasm characteristic of preeclampsia.
