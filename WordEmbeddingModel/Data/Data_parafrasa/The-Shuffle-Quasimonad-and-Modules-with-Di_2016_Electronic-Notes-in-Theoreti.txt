Differential linear logic and its corresponding categorical structure, known as differential categories, introduced the concept of a differential structure associated with a (co)monad. Traditionally, in fields such as algebraic geometry, the differential structure of an algebra is expressed by having a module with a derivation, which is a map that satisfies the Leibniz rule. In the monadic approach, one can continue to work with algebras and derivations, but the additional structure allows for the definition of other rules of the differential calculus for such modules. In particular, a monadic version of the chain rule and other basic identities can be defined.

A prime example of a codifferential category is the category of (discrete) vector spaces and linear maps. The monad here is given by the symmetric algebra construction, and the deriving transform is the usual differentiation of polynomials. Further details can be found in the respective reference. Another example in a topological context is provided by the category of convenient vector spaces and continuous linear maps, which forms a differential category.

To provide the groundwork for our definition and examples, we describe a quasimonad structure, which was motivated by the fundamental work of Guo and Keigher. We operate in the category of vector spaces over an arbitrary field, denoted as V. The free tensor algebra over V has a well-known monad structure, but it also possesses a quasimonad structure, which we now describe. We will work with homogeneous elements and denote the length of a homogeneous element w by |w|.

It is worth noting that every rota-baxter algebra is a module with integration over itself, given its evident right-module structure. The shuffle quasimonad provides a much broader class of examples, and it is anticipated that when a comprehensive theory of integral linear logic is established, it will offer an even greater source of examples.

The primary objective of this work was to develop a theory of integral linear logic and integral categories to parallel the corresponding differential theories. This work is still ongoing, but we believe that the shuffle structure is a key element in understanding the integral theory. Furthermore, it is of interest in its own right. The idea of weakening the notion of monad to quasimonad is novel for linear logic and warrants further exploration. It is also worth acknowledging that a different version of a weaker structure was introduced in prior work. Additionally, the combinatorics of shuffling and its variants is intriguing, and it prompts contemplation about other structures and their implications for linear logic.

Two potential directions for future work are as follows. Firstly, it is important to develop the aforementioned theories in the noncommutative case. This work for the differential setting has been initiated in a preprint. Free rota-baxter algebras in the noncommutative case have been constructed by Ebrahimi-Fard and Guo using operations on rooted trees. This construction arises in the renormalization of perturbative quantum field theory.
