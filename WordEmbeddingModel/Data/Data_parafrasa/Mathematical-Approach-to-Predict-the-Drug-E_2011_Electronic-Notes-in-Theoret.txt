Several mathematical approaches, utilizing both linear and non-linear techniques, are employed to study the mechanisms driving tumor growth and development. This research focuses on the progression of a specific type of malignant tumor characterized by a stem-differentiation hierarchy. The study explores two main issues: the differentiation phase and the phenotypic plasticity, which indicates a dynamic interaction between cancer stem cells and non-cancer stem cells. The models also investigate the effects of various therapies, such as drug concentrations and oncoantigen-driven vaccinations, on breast cancer cell populations over time.

Building upon previous models, this study examines the progression of malignant tumors characterized by the stem-differentiation hierarchy. It expands on existing ordinary differential equation (ODE) systems to account for all cancer types within this hierarchical model. Two key aspects are addressed: the differentiation phase (previously only considering the proliferation phase of all subpopulations) and the phenotypic plasticity involving dynamic interactions among cancer stem cells and non-cancer stem cells, with the ODE system also incorporating the effects of drugs on cancer cells at different concentrations.

Recent research has expanded our understanding of tumor maintenance and the initiation of relapse, leading to a shift from the traditional view of cancer organization to a new concept of heterogeneity. This revised understanding acknowledges the existence of cancer stem cells (CSCs) capable of differentiating into diverse cancer subpopulations.

CSC subpopulations drive the growth and progression of tumors, and the tumor's hierarchical organization is maintained through CSC differentiation. CSCs give rise to committed progenitor cells (PCs), which, in turn, give rise to rapidly proliferating cells, culminating in terminally differentiated cells.

CSCs are defined as cells capable of symmetric division (producing two cells of the same CSC type) or asymmetric division (generating both a CSC and a PC cell) upon receiving appropriate external signals. While the mechanism governing whether a stem cell divides symmetrically or asymmetrically remains unknown, empirical evidence suggests that environmental conditions may influence this process. The microenvironment, or niche, in which CSCs reside is crucial, as environmental pressures prompt constant physiological and gene expression adaptations in the cells. Evidence also suggests that PCs may differentiate into CSCs in response to environmental signals, highlighting bidirectional interconvertibility due to contextual signals that can reprogram non-CSCs into CSCs.

The structure of cancer in the stem-differentiation hierarchy model has implications for the design of cancer therapies. Research indicates that CSCs exhibit resistance to many current cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy, while these treatments demonstrate a positive effect on terminally differentiated cells. Therapies targeting only the terminally differentiated cell subpopulation are unlikely to have a significant clinical impact on the entire tumor if they fail to eliminate CSCs, as this could lead to the regeneration of new tumors. Therefore, novel cancer therapies need to consider these dynamics and be designed to account for both genetic alterations and the differentiation states of CSCs to effectively eradicate them.
