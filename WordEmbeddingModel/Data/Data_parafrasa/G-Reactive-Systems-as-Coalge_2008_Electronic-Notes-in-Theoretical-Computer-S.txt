The universal coalgebra framework allows for the characterization of bisimilarity as the final semantics, providing a minimal realization that identifies bisimilar states for each labeled transition system (LTS). Additionally, it enables the lifting of coalgebras to an algebraic setting, such as bialgebras or structured coalgebras, with the property that bisimilarity is compositional with respect to the lifted structure. The existence of minimal realizations defines operational semantics using structural axioms and reduction rules. This approach is commonly used to define process calculi for complex systems, particularly those involving name generation and communication, as the structural axioms provide insight into the intended structure of the system states while the non-conditional reaction rules offer a direct account of possible steps. However, the reduction semantics in itself is neither abstract nor compositional.

In this paper, we present a coalgebraic characterization of standard reactive systems based on Leifer and Milner's approach, and extend it to "g-reactive systems." We demonstrate that the extension is straightforward, utilizing the decomposition property of "gipos" instead of "ipos."

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces fundamental concepts in 2-categories and g-categories, essential for the discussion of g-reactive systems in Section 3. In Section 4, coalgebras and structured coalgebras are introduced. Section 5 defines a coalgebra for the LTS derived from the reactive system, and Section 6 establishes that if the base category has "grpos," then the defined coalgebra is a structured coalgebra, making bisimilarity a congruence.

The "middle four interchange law" is discussed, stating that in 2-categories, the order of composition of 2-cells is unimportant. It is shown that in any possible diagram, different ways to combine vertical and horizontal compositions yield the same composite 2-cell, a primitive operation known as "pasting."

The paper proceeds to provide a coalgebraic characterization of gipo labeled transition systems of g-reactive systems. The universe of observations is defined, and the paper introduces a functor parametric with respect to the base g-category, representing the contexts. The coalgebraic model previously outlined does not consider the algebraic structure of the states or contextualization possibilities. To address this, the construction is extended to a structured setting where the base category is a category of algebras with contextualization operations. It is assumed that the category "c" has a strict distinguished object, necessary to distinguish between elements and operations of algebras.

The paper concludes by discussing the analogy between the proof presented and Theorem 1 of the analogous theorem for reactive systems a la Leifer and Milner, indicating that it is not crucial which construction is used, but rather that the construction satisfies certain properties. The significance of borrowed contexts in deriving an sos semantics is also highlighted, indicating its potential in providing a richer model.
