It has been approximately a decade since a portion of the theoretical computer science community began showing interest in the application of formal methods to the field of systems biology. Since that time, the pursuit of a calculus that encompasses proteins, compartments, or channels as primary elements has remained ongoing. Among the numerous languages proposed to address various aspects of systems biology, several concepts have stood out as particularly significant. These include the representation of the cellular medium as a graph, with nodes symbolizing molecules and edges depicting physical connections between these molecules, as well as languages incorporating a natural concept of location.

One noteworthy enhancement to the language is the introduction of compartments (referred to as c2), which introduces the notion of projectivity of membrane reactions. This allows for the specification of patches of membrane without having to address the global curvature, and is accompanied by a proven sound and complete matching algorithm. Additionally, generators in this stage permit modelers to create and destroy compartments in a projective manner.

The final stage of the construction involves addressing the diffusion problem, including means to describe connected components of reactants, which is crucial for a new set of generators modeling the diffusion of molecular species and intra-molecular complex formation. This phase represents the first calculus of its kind that enables the modeling of molecular agents at both a micro level (involving purely local interactions) and a macro level (involving connected components of agents).

The paper also introduces a framework for dealing with the naming of molecular components such as domain and protein names, acknowledging the challenge of potentially multiple names denoting the same protein or gene. Additionally, it proposes a simple notion of compartmentalization based on the underlying relationship with bigraphs to be added to the language.

Furthermore, the paper presents an extension of the grammar for the language, introducing the notation of partial species describing connected components or patterns that should be placed in a context that will make them connected.

The incorporation of this notion of connectivity (i.e., transitive closure of name sharing) in the proposed calculus becomes relevant for specific interactions, such as diffusion, and is discussed in the section outlining the new generators.

In conclusion, the paper presents advancements in the development of a calculus for systems biology, addressing important features such as compartments, diffusion, and naming of molecular components, contributing to the ongoing effort to apply formal methods to this field.
