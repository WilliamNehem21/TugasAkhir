In this paper, we introduce a new logic called hybrid duration calculus (hdc), which is an extension of the restricted duration calculus (rdc) with additional hybrid logical elements including nominals, satisfaction operators, the down-arrow binder, and the global modality. The rdc is known to be decidable, and we demonstrate that this decidability is preserved when the hybrid logical machinery is incorporated. The decidability of hdc is established by reducing the satisfiability problem to the satisfiability of the monadic second-order theory of order. We emphasize the enhanced expressive power of hdc compared to rdc by demonstrating that hdc can express all 13 possible relations between intervals, while rdc cannot.

Our work is based on the duration calculus (dc), an extension of interval temporal logic (itl), which was developed as a tool for reasoning about real-time systems. One unique feature of dc is its ability to express and reason about the duration of states within a system. However, undecidability issues arise even with simple propositional subsets of dc formulas, and as a result, only decidable subsets of dc have been considered in previous research.

The core idea of our work involves extending rdc with hybrid logical elements to achieve increased expressiveness while maintaining decidability. We introduce nominals, a down-arrow binder, and the global modality to rdc, and establish decidability results for the resulting hybrid logic.

We provide decidability results for both discrete and continuous time hybrid rdc by utilizing translations to the monadic second-order theory of order. For discrete time, we demonstrate that the satisfiability problem in this theory can be decided in natural number structures, and for continuous time, we show that the satisfiability problem can be decided in signal structures. Additionally, we illustrate the enhanced expressiveness of the hybrid version of rdc.

We define the syntax and semantics of rdc and consider both continuous-time and discrete-time interpretations of rdc. The discrete-time semantics are defined similarly to the continuous-time semantics, with specific assignment requirements for nominals and intervals.

We highlight that hdc exhibits greater expressiveness than standard rdc, as rdc lacks the ability to express neighborhood modalities. We provide an intuitive explanation for this limitation, emphasizing the contrasting nature of the contracting modalities in rdc and the expanding modalities found in neighborhood modalities like PNL.

The discrete-time semantics of hdc are straightforwardly defined as an extension of the methodology presented earlier. Furthermore, we emphasize that the satisfiability problem for rdc, and consequently hdc, carries a non-elementary complexity, indicating that more efficient decision procedures for hdc may be challenging to develop.

In summary, we introduce hybrid duration calculus (hdc) as an extension of rdc with additional hybrid logical elements, and demonstrate its decidability with respect to both discrete-time and continuous-time domains. Our results are achieved by establishing translations to decidable fragments of the monadic second-order theory of order, which preserve satisfiability.
