The presence of abundant shale gas reserves plays a crucial role in the development of new energy sources. Effectively developing shale gas fields relies on identifying the main factors impacting shale gas well productivity. This study focuses on the Fuling marine Longmaxi formation and establishes a single-well geological model using CMG reservoir simulation software. Using the Monte Carlo method, 10,000 different reservoir models were generated for varying formation physical parameters, completion parameters, and fracturing parameters. A machine learning model was then trained using this dataset and multiple regression methods, with the Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) algorithm demonstrating the highest accuracy with an R-squared value of 0.96. A workflow for optimizing fracturing parameters was formulated, integrating a production prediction model with a particle swarm optimizer (PSO) to quickly optimize fracturing parameters and forecast production under different geological conditions. The optimized parameters include fracture spacing and characteristics of shale gas reservoirs.

Other related research has focused on factors affecting shale gas reservoir productivity, including the effect of reservoir and hydraulic fracturing parameters on gas productivity, as well as the accuracy of multi-stage hydraulic fracture simulations for shale gas production data. The study also presented a comparison of different machine learning models for production prediction, ultimately recommending the use of the GBDT model for single well capacity prediction and fracturing efficacy evaluation.

Challenges identified in this area of research include the need for a complete production curve data, as well as the consideration of geological conditions and historical production data to ensure prediction model accuracy. Furthermore, the study emphasizes the significance of adequate data and the mitigation of overfitting when employing machine learning methods.

To assist with improving the understanding of the study's methodology and algorithms utilized, the section provides detailed descriptions of the machine learning methods employed, including linear regression, support vector machines (SVM), decision tree (DT) regression, GBDT regression, and random forest, as well as an explanation of the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm.
