Despite the widespread use of social media in Arabic-speaking countries across all age groups, research focusing on author profiling (AP) is still in its early stages. This study introduces the Egyptian Dialect Gender Annotated Dataset (EDGAD) collected from Twitter, as well as a proposed solution for gender identification (GI) through text classification. The dataset comprises 70,000 tweets per gender. The proposed approach involves a mixed feature vector (MFV) incorporating various stylometric and Egyptian Arabic dialect (EAD) language-specific features, in addition to an n-gram feature vector (NFV). The random forest (RF) with MFV and logistic regression (LR) with NFV are combined using ensemble weighted average, achieving a gender identification accuracy of 87.6%.

Gender identification of authors has become increasingly crucial due to the proliferation of fake identities on social media platforms. With a growing number of Arabic language writers on social media, it is essential to study gender identification methodologies and models, particularly in the context of the unique nature of the Arabic language.

Research in Arabic author profiling, particularly in dialectal Arabic, is still in its early stages, and there is a scarcity of resources and lexicons. Additionally, the average accuracy achieved for dialectal Arabic gender identification needs improvement. This study introduces the EDGAD dataset to address this gap and proposes a comprehensive GI model, along with an engineered feature vector that integrates various EAD language-related features with the NFV, achieving 87.6% accuracy.

The dataset consists of male and female sets, each containing 70 accounts. Each account comprises a variable number of tweets in the case of an unbalanced dataset and is limited to 1000 tweets in the case of a balanced dataset. Cross-validation with 7 folds is applied, with each fold containing 10 accounts of each gender, resulting in a training set of 120 accounts and a testing set of 20 accounts for each fold. This ensures that tweets from a specific account are not present in both the training and testing sets within the same fold.

A list of words in Egyptian Arabic representing various topics, such as swear words and emotions, is compiled. Furthermore, 180,000 tweets are collected, including retweets and tweets from 100 accounts in January 2018, which are not included in the dataset. These tweets are used as input for creating a word2vec model using the skip-gram approach with specific parameters.

The RF classifier is employed to build multiple decision tree models, while the LR classifier is utilized to construct the decision boundaries for the NFV. The use of ensemble weighted average is based on experiments indicating the superior performance of these classifiers over others, as detailed in the experiments section.
