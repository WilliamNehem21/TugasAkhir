Finite state automata (FSA) implementations are widely utilized in information technology because of their broad range of potential applications, adaptability, and direct alignment with the typical objectives established by regular business applications. With the emergence of workflow-based programming, a new and exciting field has opened up wherein workflows are governed by FSA. While the .NET 3.0 platform introduces the Workflow Foundation engine specifically designed for managing workflows, due to the favorable properties of FSA, there is often a desire to construct applications around FSA implementations even in simpler scenarios. This paper presents an automata generator framework that enables the utilization of automata whenever feasible. The framework's high applicability and flexibility stem from its capability to rely on both static and dynamic information in the generation process, thereby allowing for runtime performance. From a technical perspective, the framework generates implementations based on lambda expressions, leveraging the new functional enhancements of the C# 3.0 language.

A finite state automaton, or state machine, is a mathematical machine that can be in precisely one state from a finite set of states at any given time. A crucial subset of these states comprises initial states, and when the automaton is activated, it may be in any of the initial states. Upon receiving input from a finite alphabet and meeting specific conditions or constraints, the automaton can transition from its current state to a subsequent state, known as a state transition. If the automaton is in a final state once there is no more input, it is deemed to have accepted its input.

Finite state automata are popular due to their applicability to numerous practical problems. As workflow-based programming gains significance among programming paradigms, a compelling application area emerges wherein workflows can be represented by an automaton governing the business rules driving the workflow. While sophisticated frameworks such as the Workflow Foundation engine of the .NET platform support workflow-based programming, there are scenarios where it is essential to bring implementation details closer to programmers without exposing excessive internal behavior or necessitating the use of intricate environments or additional designer tools.

Among the new features introduced in the C# 2.0 language, the generics construct was the most significant improvement. However, it also introduced lesser-known yet interesting features, including anonymous methods, which enable the creation of unnamed or "anonymous" methods. A similar concept of anonymous classes was previously introduced in the Java programming language. Java operates with interfaces and their implementations instead of function pointers or delegates, resulting in the anonymous level being that of the class.

For each state, a container holds a lambda expression determining the next state for a given input. This lambda expression is of the generic type Func<string, statevalue>, denoting a lambda expression with a string input and a statevalue output. Additionally, the declarative description is validated according to a previously defined schema, and upon validation, the XML file generates the constant container, statevalue enumerations, and lambda expression definitions. In this instance, the statevalue enumeration includes the values twenty, fifteen, ten, five, and soda.

While our initial solution has limited functionality and there are several issues to address, one interesting consideration is the handling of tail recursion. Unlike many functional environments, C# does not handle tail recursion, potentially leading to stack overflows. However, there is an IL (Intermediate Language) instruction called tail that permits correction of the emitted code at the IL level.

We envision numerous extensions to this implementation. In the future, we plan to incorporate support for multiple start and end states, as well as state transitions controlled by a guard condition. These extensions could likely be integrated into the existing solution with minimal adjustments. However, implementing a non-deterministic automaton using lambdas may pose considerable challenges.
