Enhanced management practices have been refined through technological innovations, such as the increased utilization of yield simulation, field monitoring (Rao and Sridhar, 2018), and other data-driven techniques. Precision in resource management has been continually improved through the application of crop models and the use of satellite navigation systems.

Various techniques and models, such as deep learning (DL) and deep neural networks (DNN), have been employed to estimate environmental variables and predict crop yield. Studies have demonstrated the superiority of DL-based models over other methods for the estimation of biochemical oxygen demand and total phosphorus loads at watershed scales, as well as for predicting crop yield.

In a specific study, numerous environmental input variables, including precipitation, irrigation, maximum and minimum temperatures, and solar radiation, were considered in the development of a model for forecasting maize yields. The model was trained using data from 100 different climate scenarios combined with random irrigation scenarios, which generated a large dataset of maize yield records. Daily weather data, essential for accurate crop model outputs, was collected and generated using weather stochastic disaggregation tools.

The Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) model, a widely used tool for simulating crop growth, has been utilized for over 30 years. Data from a maize irrigation experiment was incorporated into the DSSAT model, and a deep learning model was trained and calibrated based on the experimental results.

A simpler deep learning model with comparable accuracy was explored through the application of various variable reduction methods, such as Bayesian variable selection, Spearman rank correlation, and principal component analysis (PCA) feature extraction. Among these methods, the PCA feature extraction method showed the highest accuracy during training tests, but lower accuracy during testing.

Overall, these advancements in management practices and technological tools hold significant potential for improving agricultural productivity and resource management.
