The probability of a system being available at a given time, known as point availability, is a key consideration in the study of grid systems, which require substantial resources to function effectively. However, due to the complexity of grid systems, it can be challenging to model and solve for their availability. This paper proposes a component-based approach associated with a tensor-based numerical method to address this issue.

While the computation of steady-state availability for large systems is feasible using efficient numerical analysis techniques, determining point availability is more difficult. Although algorithms for point availability computation are simpler to write, they may require a large number of iterations and the size of the Markov chain can significantly impact the feasibility of the analysis.

Stochastic automata networks, a high-level formalism, have been designed to address the issue of state space explosion by utilizing a tensor representation of the chain. Instead of storing the chain as a sparse matrix, small matrices derived from the specifications are used to construct the transition matrix of the chain. Additionally, computation can be performed on the reachability state space, which is typically much smaller than the potential state space.

Various high-level formalisms, such as Petri nets and stochastic process algebra, are now capable of storing the transition matrix of a chain in tensor form. However, new methods need to be developed to take advantage of this tensor representation, and these methods may be more complex than simple algorithms based on sparse matrix representation. This paper advocates for the use of tensor representation of the chain as an alternative approach to obtaining, storing, and analyzing the chain and the point availability of systems. New versions of classic algorithms tailored for tensor representation have been implemented for analysis of the grid point availability problem.

Stochastic automata networks (SAN) is a structured Markovian formalism that describes continuous-time Markovian models as a collection of subsystems with independent behavior and occasional interdependencies. Each subsystem is represented as a stochastic automaton, and the global state of an SAN model is defined by the Cartesian product of the local states of all automata. Events that change the global state can be local or synchronizing, and functional rates can be used to model interaction among automata.

The paper also presents a potential description of a grid platform using SAN, which consists of interconnected sites providing CPUs. Two types of generic automata, site automaton and link automaton, are proposed to model the grid platform. The paper also demonstrates how SAN can model dependencies among components using functions, such as modeling different repair behaviors and service policies.

In addition, the potential reduction of the number of direct connections in the grid platform, based on the characteristics of clusters and redundancy, is discussed as a means of simplifying the model and computational analysis.
