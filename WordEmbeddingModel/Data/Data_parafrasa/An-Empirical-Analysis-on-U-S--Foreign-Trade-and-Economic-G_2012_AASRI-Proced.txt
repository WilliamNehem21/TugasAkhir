This research utilized data spanning from 1960 to 2010 to examine the correlation between U.S. foreign trade and its economic expansion. The analysis through Granger causality tests revealed a mutually impactful association between American exports and its GDP, while a unidirectional link was observed between American imports and its GDP. This suggests that American imports did not exert Granger causation on American GDP growth, indicating that efforts to shield and curtail imports may not facilitate economic advancement for the U.S.

Following the financial crisis, the United States implemented measures such as anti-dumping, anti-subsidy, and other protective trade clauses to limit imports and decrease trade deficits in a bid to revive its economy. However, these practices have had adverse effects on the legitimate interests of its trade partners. Furthermore, the impact of American imports on restraining economic growth necessitates further examination.

The study incorporated data encompassing the period from 1960 to 2010. The selected time series variables included U.S. gross domestic product (GDP), exports (EX), and imports (IM), sourced from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). The empirical analysis was conducted using EViews 6.0 for data processing.

The test outcomes revealed that the maximum lag order number was 2 under the five information criteria, permitting the construction of vector autoregression models VAR(2) accordingly. The model exhibited a high coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.998454), indicating a strong model fit. 

Subsequently, the analysis of the relationship between America's GDP (LGDP) and its imports (LIM) indicated that at a 5% significance level, LGDP is the Granger cause of LIM, while LIM is not the Granger cause of LGDP. This suggests that an increase in GDP contributes to the expansion of national income, thereby driving up the demand for goods and services, including those from foreign sources.

Based on the empirical findings, it was observed that there is a bidirectional relationship between American exports and its GDP, whereas there is only a unidirectional relationship between American imports and its GDP, and American imports do not exert Granger causality on its GDP. Furthermore, there is no Granger causality relationship between American imports and its exports. Therefore, it is posited that the current U.S. foreign trade policy is ineffective in promoting economic growth, necessitating the development of a new trade policy focused on expanding exports rather than restricting imports.
