Networks with an unknown number of nodes are common in various practical scenarios, such as processes running on a computer, machines in a token ring, local area networks (LANs), and the World Wide Web. For such parameterized networks, a variety of algorithms, including mutual exclusion, leader election, group membership, and distributed memory algorithms, have been developed with the expectation that they will function effectively for any specific number of participants. While it is recognized that the problem is undecidable, there has been significant interest in verifying these protocols. Furthermore, automated and semi-automated methods for verifying restricted classes of parameterized networks have been created.

Finite subsets of natural numbers and process transitions in the network are described using Weak Second-Order Logic (WS1S). Given a boolean abstraction relation in WS1S, an abstract system can be constructed automatically. This method has been applied to verify several parameterized protocols. By utilizing an additional marking algorithm and the lifting of fairness conditions, liveness properties for these protocols have been established.

To illustrate this method, we discuss a distributed shared memory protocol as an example. The protocol has two parameters: the number of processes and the number of memory pages. In order to ensure exclusive write and multiple read operations, the processes need to be aware of the access privileges of the other processes. We provide a generic abstraction for this type of protocol within the framework of PVS and demonstrate how to analyze the abstract WS1S system using Pax and SMV to prove safety and liveness properties of the protocol.

In the case where a is finite, we refer to it as a finite abstraction relation. We discuss the preservation result, which shows the interest in verification by abstraction. Additionally, we discuss how this result applies to various temporal logics without existential quantification over paths, such as CTL*, LTL, or 2[7,8,21].

Furthermore, we highlight that network protocols often involve data structures that encompass sets of processors in the network. Shared memory protocols and group membership protocols are examples of such protocols. We illustrate how the concept of reducing the state space of each processor by introducing a global structure that is used by all processors can be applied to other protocols, using a group membership protocol as an example. We analyze a synchronous group membership protocol by first deductively proving agreement and then reducing the system using a global membership-list maintained by the properly functioning processors.

We present Definition 3.1, which defines a parameterized system with n processors and a second parameter p, along with requirements for weak fairness and non-blocking queues. We demonstrate how the reduced system is strictly parameterized in p and discuss how to represent the resulting network in the framework of WS1S. We then explain the abstraction techniques used to analyze it.

Finally, we delve into the terms and formulae of WS1S, including the construction of WS1S terms and formulae using atomic formulae and applying boolean connectives and quantification over first-order and second-order variables.
