Plant variety protection (PVP) has become increasingly prominent in influencing social development and has gained substantial attention globally. The rapid expansion of PVP has resulted in significant pressure on the selection of similar varieties used in PVP examinations, or DUS tests. This situation has posed challenges to the traditional manual selection of similar varieties. To address this, a proposed information system of common knowledge varieties aims to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of PVP examinations, while organizing information related to plant varieties. This paper presents the framework, management, maintenance, and functionality of the system, and illustrates its application in the selection of similar varieties. Utilizing this system can standardize and simplify the selection of similar varieties, removing the subjective judgment of PVP examiners and effectively managing plant variety information.

With the rise of knowledge economics, intellectual property has emerged as a crucial indicator of a country or region's comprehensive strength and core competitiveness. It plays a pivotal role in scientific and technological progress, economic development, and social stability. As a form of intellectual property, plant variety protection (PVP) not only holds the key to modern agricultural development but also serves as a safeguard for social progress.

In 1999, China joined the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV) as its 39th member. Over the past 13 years, China's PVP efforts have progressed significantly, with a notable increase in the number of PVP applications and grants. This growth has led to an expansion in the number of known varieties, placing additional pressure on the selection of similar varieties. Consequently, a need has arisen for an information-based platform to support PVP examination by sorting out various information related to known varieties and ensuring accurate and effective selection of similar varieties.

Apart from characteristic descriptions, photography has emerged as an effective method for visually depicting varieties. To enable comparison of different varieties using photographs, specific plant parts targeted for photography should be defined and included in the framework. Additionally, registration information, including registration code, date, conclusion, etc., generated when a variety enters national or provincial registration, can be managed through the system by adding, deleting, revising, and inquiring about this information.

When a variety applies for PVP, it must undergo DUS testing with reference to similar varieties. These similar varieties are selected from known varieties and are based on characteristic descriptions and DNA fingerprint analysis. The selection process involves confirming the range of candidate varieties, considering plant genera and species, characteristic variation, and comparing expressions of the same characteristic, with a specific sequence for comparing qualitative, quantitative, and pseudo-quantitative characteristics. Finally, DNA fingerprint analysis and comparison of the loci of amplified DNA bands are used to determine the similarity between varieties. Differences should be minimized in both characteristic descriptions and DNA fingerprint comparisons.

Overall, the proposed information system provides a comprehensive and standardized approach for managing and selecting similar plant varieties, offering significant potential to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of PVP examination.
