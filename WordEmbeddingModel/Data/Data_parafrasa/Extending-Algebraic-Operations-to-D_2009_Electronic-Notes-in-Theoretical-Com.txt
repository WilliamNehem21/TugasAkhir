As an initial step, we start by selecting a very broad type of completion, which is the space of all nonempty closed subsets with the weak topology, and then we extend the algebraic operations to this space. Subsequently, we restrict these algebraic operations to the sobrification of the original space, where the sobrification can be seen as a subset of the space of all nonempty closed subsets by limiting it to the irreducible ones. Finally, we confine the operations to the d-completion, which is a subset of the sobrification.

We provide a brief overview of the Scott topology, as detailed in various sources. The closed sets in the Scott topology of a partially ordered set are precisely the lower sets that are closed when considering directed suprema. A function between partially ordered sets is Scott-continuous if it is continuous with respect to the Scott topologies. The following lemma is well-established, though it is not typically stated in this level of generality.

In terms of the specialization order, every semitopological algebra can be regarded as a partially ordered algebra; specifically, continuous functions preserve the specialization order. Furthermore, the specialization order on a product of spaces corresponds to the product of the specialization orderings on the individual factors, and a function defined on a direct product of partially ordered sets is monotone if and only if it is separately monotone. Conversely, every partially ordered algebra can be treated as a topological algebra by equipping it with the Alexandroff or a-discrete topology in which the open sets are all upper sets.

It is noteworthy that a topological space is considered conditionally up-complete if every directed subset that is bounded above has a supremum to which it converges. It has been demonstrated in section 8 of a certain publication that every topological space possesses a conditional d-completion, which is a strongly dense embedding universally applicable to continuous mappings into conditionally up-complete spaces. For a space X, this conditional d-completion can be construed as the lower set of the image of X in Xd, where Xd denotes the d-completion. It is a direct consequence of the fact that the elementary operations of a semitopological algebra A, as well as their extensions to Ad, are order-preserving, that this lower set is a subalgebra of Ad.

Another instance of interest is a c-space, which is a continuous poset in the sense of a specific reference. We define a continuous partially ordered algebra as an algebra and a continuous poset, such that all fundamental operations of the algebra are Scott-continuous. Moreover, if A is a continuous domain, we refer to it as a continuous dcpo-algebra. With regard to the Scott topology, a continuous partially ordered algebra is deemed a topological algebra. From the previous proposition, it follows that...

One of the primary motivations behind the authors' investigation of d-completions has been the potential application to the analysis of cones, particularly T0-cones, which emerge as power domains in probabilistic semantics and in certain approaches to potential theory in mathematics. As seen in Corollary 6.7, the cone operations extend to the d-completion. We plan to undertake a more focused examination of cones and the d-completion in our future research.
