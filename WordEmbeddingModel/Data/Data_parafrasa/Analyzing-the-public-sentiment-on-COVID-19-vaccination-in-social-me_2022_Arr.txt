The transmission of a certain disease has prompted countries like the USA, China, and Russia to take action in producing vaccines. Developed nations have initiated widespread vaccination efforts, with Bangladesh's government also embarking on a vaccination program since early 2021. By January 2022, over 160 million vaccine doses have been administered, with more than 62 million individuals fully vaccinated.

Amid the launch of the COVID-19 vaccination program in Bangladesh, citizens are utilizing social media platforms to express their views and reactions. Their responses have been mixed, and there is a lack of studies analyzing the sentiments of Bangladeshi netizens toward the vaccination program. This study seeks to address this gap by examining the opinions and feelings of Bangladeshi netizens about COVID-19 vaccines and the ongoing vaccination campaigns, taking into account various demographic attributes. Additionally, this research aims to extract the primary themes expressed by Bangladeshi netizens regarding these campaigns. Various machine learning and deep learning approaches have been proposed in this study.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses related works, while Section 3 details the methodology for analyzing Bangladeshi netizens' opinions on COVID-19 vaccines and the ongoing vaccination program. Section 4 presents the study's results, and Section 5 concludes the paper and outlines potential future avenues for research.

Several prior studies have examined public attitudes towards the COVID-19 pandemic using various machine learning and deep learning models. For instance, Naseem et al. used a large dataset of COVID-19-related tweets to study public attitudes and found that the BERT model showed the best performance in classifying public sentiments. Chakraborty et al. employed deep learning-based models and proposed a fuzzy model based on the Gaussian membership function to identify public sentiments with high accuracy.

Similarly, other studies have used LDA for topic modeling and employed neural network-based models to identify sentiments and misconceptions regarding the pandemic and COVID-19 vaccines. The majority of these studies found that public sentiments varied based on factors such as the number of new cases, fatalities, and recoveries, as well as attitudes toward domestic and imported vaccines.

The present study fills a void in the research by focusing on Bangladeshi netizens' opinions about the vaccine and vaccination process using machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing techniques. It utilizes different deep learning and traditional machine learning techniques to identify the sentiments and extract latent topics discussed by Bangladeshis on social media and news portals.

The paper outlines a detailed methodology for labeling sentiments and analyzing the polarity of netizens' statements, as well as for identifying the most discussed topics among Bangladeshi citizens regarding the vaccine and vaccination process. The study leverages machine learning techniques such as deep learning models with word embedding to predict sentiment polarity, achieving high accuracy in the process.

Overall, the study contributes to understanding public opinions and sentiments surrounding COVID-19 vaccines and vaccination campaigns in Bangladesh, and it suggests potential future research directions in this area.
