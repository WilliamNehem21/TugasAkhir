A study was conducted to explore the potential of using Gabor wavelets as a tool for classifying scenes (such as bare patches, plants, or weeds) in wild blueberry fields, with the ultimate goal of applying agrochemicals in a site-specific manner. Images were collected from five sites in central Nova Scotia, Canada, and Gabor wavelet features extracted from these images were employed in the classification process using stepwise linear discriminant analysis.

Given the wild and perennial nature of wild blueberry plants, there are limited cultural practices for weed control, leading to a heavy reliance on herbicides. This results in significant expenditure by the industry on herbicides.

Various technologies, including digital color image-based co-occurrence matrix algorithms, ultrasonic ranging, Gabor wavelets, and discrete wavelet transforms of digital images, have been investigated for classifying wild blueberry plantation scenes and developing site-specific herbicide application. Systems utilizing digital image classification have shown effective identification of weeds and bare patches, regardless of plant or weed height. Recent studies have explored image-based spot application of fertilizer, herbicide, and fungicide in wild blueberry fields, yielding promising results.

A Gabor wavelet transform of an image involves convolving the image with a Gabor wavelet filter, designed to selectively pass regions containing specific sizes and orientations. Gabor wavelet transforms are based on a mother wavelet designed to capture certain shape structures, allowing the passage of similarly shaped and sized objects with close orientation to the filter.

Fields 2 and 3 were in their vegetative year, with sparsely populated wild blueberry plants interspersed with weeds and bare patches. Field 4 was in its fruit year, with scattered dense wild blueberry plants and various predominant weeds. The lighting conditions varied among the fields.

The user interface allowed the user to start a new classification task or resume an ongoing one by opening a relevant file. The user could then choose an image to begin the classification process, and the selected image would be displayed in different windows.

In terms of classification accuracy, field 4 achieved the highest value at 98.3%, while the set attained the lowest accuracy at 81.4%. The results obtained in this study were comparable to those achieved with the color co-occurrence matrix-based texture analysis technique reported by Chang et al. (2012).
