Obesity is an increasing health issue that is a major contributing factor to various chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, type-2 diabetes, osteoarthritis, and certain types of cancer. Additionally, a correlation between obesity and male infertility has been proposed.

In recent years, there has been a significant rise in the use of natural plants for promoting health and preventing diseases. Aromatic plants, which contain essential oils (EOs) with pleasant odors, have gained attention for their therapeutic properties. Marjoram, a well-known aromatic plant native to the Mediterranean region, has been traditionally used in folk medicine to treat various conditions such as coughs, cramps, depression, and gastrointestinal disorders. Likewise, sage, a member of the Lamiaceae family, is commonly used as a spice and has been associated with therapeutic effects, particularly in treating muscle pain and digestive disorders. Both marjoram and sage have been identified for their potential curative activities and are used in food processing and flavoring.

Despite the existing research supporting the medicinal properties of marjoram and sage oil extracts, there is limited knowledge about their impact on obesity and related diseases, specifically male infertility. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effectiveness of administering marjoram and sage oil extracts in reducing the negative impact of obesity on male fertility. The study evaluated various reproductive indices, including lipid profile, reproductive hormones, testicular enzymes, and histopathological changes in testicular tissue.

The results of the study revealed that the administration of marjoram and sage oil extracts effectively prevented an increase in body weight gain and adiposity index compared to obese rats. Furthermore, the oils contributed to an improved lipid profile, increased levels of serum androgens, and a decline in estrogen, leptin, and prolactin levels, indicating enhanced fertility. Additionally, the administration of the oil extracts helped to normalize epididymal sperm count and maintain the structural integrity of the testis.

The beneficial effects of marjoram and sage oil extracts on obesity and male infertility may be attributed to their active constituents, including terpenoids, which have been shown to modulate the activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), involved in energy homeostasis and reproductive functions.

In conclusion, the study demonstrated the potential of marjoram and sage oil extracts in mitigating the negative effects of obesity on male fertility. The findings suggest that these aromatic plant extracts may offer a promising approach in preventing male infertility linked to obesity.
