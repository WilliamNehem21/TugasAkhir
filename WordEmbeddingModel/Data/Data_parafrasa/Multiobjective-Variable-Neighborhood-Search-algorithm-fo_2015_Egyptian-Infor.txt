Grid computing refers to the distribution and coordination of computing, application, data, and storage or network resources across dynamic and geographically dispersed organizations. Grid resources, such as computers, storage space, instruments, software applications, and data, are shared by users through the submission of computing tasks to the grid system. These resources are interconnected through the internet and a middleware layer that provides basic services for security, monitoring, resource management, and other functions.

Variable neighborhood search (VNS) is a meta-heuristic method designed to effectively address difficult optimization problems. It operates by systematically changing neighborhoods during both the descent phase to find a local minimum and the perturbation phase to emerge from the corresponding valley. VNS has demonstrated strong performance in industrial applications and real-world optimization problems, including scheduling and design scenarios.

Previous research has primarily focused on the optimization of individual objectives for the scheduling problem. However, recent work has considered the optimization of multiple objectives, such as makespan, flowtime, and tardiness, in conjunction with the scheduling of grid jobs.

The performance of the VNS algorithm relies on the performance of its neighborhood, and it has been enhanced through the development of problem-specific neighborhoods for solving large-scale, heterogeneous computing scheduling problems.

A computational grid provides accessible and cost-effective access to high-end computational resources. Grid schedulers select feasible nodes for applications based on information from the grid information service (GIS) module and generate application-to-node mappings using specific objective functions and predicted node performance.

The grid information service (GIS) collects and predicts information about the state of available nodes, including CPU capacities, memory size, network bandwidth, software availabilities, and site load. This information is used to answer queries for node information or push information to subscribers.

In the context of heterogeneous computing scheduling problems, researchers often use test instances proposed by Braun et al. and the ETC performance estimation model by Ali et al. The ETC model considers machine heterogeneity, task heterogeneity, and consistency in evaluating system performance.
