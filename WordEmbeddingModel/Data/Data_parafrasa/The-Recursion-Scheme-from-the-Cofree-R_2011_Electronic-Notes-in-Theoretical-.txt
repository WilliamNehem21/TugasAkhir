This academic paper explores a novel recursion scheme that instantiates the general comonad-based construction of recursion schemes for the initial algebra of a functor f to the cofree recursive comonad on f. Unlike the scheme based on the cofree comonad on f, this new scheme enables not only recursive calls on elements structurally smaller than the given argument, but also subsidiary recursions. The authors also present a mendler formulation of the scheme using a generalized Yoneda lemma for initial algebras involving strong dinaturality and hint at a relation to circular proofs in the style of Cockett and Santocanale.

The paper is organized as follows: 
1. In Section 2, the comonad-based recursion scheme and its instantiation to cofree comonads, including course-of-value iteration, are reviewed. The Yoneda lemma, a generalized version for final coalgebras, and mendler-style recursion are also discussed. 
2. Section 3 delves into the specific instance arising when the cofree comonad is replaced with the cofree recursive comonad. 
3. In Section 4, the authors comment on a Haskell implementation of the combinators. The connection of the mendler-style scheme to circular proofs is explained in Section 5. 
4. The paper provides an orientation about related work in Section 6 and concludes with final remarks in Section 7.

The authors also note the positive generalization of the Yoneda lemma to mixed-variant hom-functors, which has not been explicitly discussed in the literature. They assert that this generalization is intimately related to the fact that the final f-coalgebra is the (big!) colimit of the f-coalgebra structure forgetting functor.

Additionally, the paper mentions the possibility of modifying the scheme to allow subsidiary recursions according to more sophisticated schemes than iteration, but the authors refrain from discussing this due to the complexity of the higher-order version presented. They recommend interested readers to explore the Haskell implementation for further details.

The work is situated within the context of functional programming with inductive and coinductive types based on categorical combinators, which was pioneered by Hagino, Cockett, and Spencer. The comonad-based recursion scheme and its related principles have roots in the work of Uustalu, Vene, and Pardo, as well as Bartels, Capretta, and Osius.

In summary, the paper presents a meaningful instance of a comonad-based recursion scheme using the cofree recursive comonad, which supports subsidiary recursions on the predecessors of the given argument. The authors highlight the natural strengthening of course-of-value iteration and its connection to the repeated regeneration phenomenon in circular proofs.
