Sifakis et al. introduced interaction systems as a framework for designing and analyzing component-based systems. In this paper, we focus on studying the property of liveness within interaction systems. Liveness of an action, component, or set of components in the context of an interaction system signifies that the action (or set of components) will recurrently participate in every run of the global system. We demonstrate that determining liveness is an NP-hard problem. Subsequently, we provide a characterization of liveness and establish a polynomial-time criterion to ensure liveness by utilizing local information. We then combine the criterion with the characterization to devise a test for liveness.

In recent years, various formal methods for specifying and analyzing component-based systems have been proposed with different objectives. We examine the interaction systems approach presented by Sifakis et al., which emphasizes the separation of concerns regarding interfaces, component behavior, and component interaction. We also consider properties such as local/global deadlock-freedom, component progress, port availability, and robustness against component failures within the framework of interaction systems.

We delve into the challenge of testing liveness in interaction systems, where a component is deemed live if it continues to participate in system steps regardless of the system's evolution or the point in time being considered. We reveal the NP-hardness of deciding the liveness of a set of components and offer a characterization of liveness for such sets within an interaction system. Furthermore, we establish a criterion for ensuring liveness that can be tested in polynomial time. Finally, we present a hybrid algorithm that integrates the characterization and criterion to test for liveness.

The structure of the paper is outlined as follows: Section 2 provides the foundational definitions, Section 3 introduces the concepts of deadlock-freedom and liveness, and Sections 4, 5, and 6 respectively address the NP-hardness, characterization, and testing approaches for liveness within interaction systems.

The interaction model for a component system, denoted as CS, is defined by a connector set, C, and a set of complete interactions, COMP. An interaction declared as complete can be executed independently of the environment, with the choice of complete interactions being a design decision specific to the modeled system.

We illustrate that a deadlock-free system, when initiated in a global initial state, can always progress with at least one maximal or complete interaction, thereby preventing cyclic waiting that involves all components, while local deadlocks may involve only a subset of components.

We highlight the distinction between liveness in interaction systems and the concept of local progress of a component in Petri nets. We also note the difficulty in directly formulating and investigating liveness properties for individual components within interaction systems due to potential loss of component identity in the system.

We present a method for checking the condition necessary to ensure liveness that involves a reachability analysis in a graph where the nodes represent components. The construction of this graph, achieved through local transition system analysis, enables the criterion to be evaluated in time polynomial to the number of components and the size of the local transition systems, thus avoiding the need to explore the global state space.

While liveness has been extensively studied in the context of Petri nets, the complexity of determining this property varies depending on the class of Petri nets considered. Moreover, the application of Petri nets in component-based modeling has been explored, but procedures for testing liveness in this context are not readily available.
