An alternative approach to ensuring compatibility among devices in the IoT perception layer involves utilizing the MQTT protocol to manage the diverse data generated by various smart objects. MQTT facilitates communication between devices by connecting them through a central server, also known as a broker, which is responsible for relaying data between machines. However, the widespread adoption of MQTT has also attracted the attention of cyber attackers, who can execute various types of attacks, including LR-DDoS attacks. LR-DDoS attacks pose a significant threat to IoT systems, particularly those reliant on the MQTT protocol, as they can congest network traffic, overwhelm devices, and deplete system resources, resulting in service disruptions and data breaches. These attacks are challenging to detect and counter, making them appealing to attackers. In addition to being vulnerable to LR-DDoS attacks, IoT devices often have limited resources, including memory, processing power, and battery life, which makes them more susceptible to security vulnerabilities in their communication protocols.

Several detection and mitigation techniques have been proposed to address the challenge of LR-DDoS attacks on IoT systems, but some of these methods may be inefficient or impractical due to the resource constraints of IoT devices. Therefore, an effective and efficient mechanism is needed to detect LR-DDoS attacks based on the MQTT protocol in software-defined IoT environments.

This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents and summarizes the relevant literature. Section 3 details the proposed scheme, the methodology for evaluating its effectiveness in detecting and preventing low-rate DDoS attacks, and the experiments conducted. Section 4 analyzes the results obtained, compares the implemented schemes, and benchmarks the proposed system against other state-of-the-art models. Finally, Section 5 concludes the article and suggests potential future research directions.

LR-DDoS attacks have become increasingly prevalent in IoT networks, leading to the development of various techniques to detect and mitigate them. The use of machine learning (ML) algorithms has garnered significant attention in this context, given the increasing number of IoT devices and their susceptibility to cyber-attacks. The literature review is categorized into three areas: LR-DDoS attacks based on IoT networks, DDoS attacks based on the MQTT protocol in IoT environments, and DDoS attacks in software-defined IoT environments.

Several research efforts have proposed various methods for detecting and mitigating LR-DDoS attacks in IoT systems. For example, a method named HMM-RF combines the hidden Markov model and random forest classifier to identify LR-DDoS attacks in cloud data centers. Another approach involves using the ReÃÅnyi entropy to calculate attack probabilities. Additionally, some researchers have simulated smart home scenarios and collected realistic MQTT-based datasets to develop online and offline ML solutions for detecting and classifying DDoS attacks. Furthermore, an entropy-based technique utilizing software-defined networking (SDN) has been proposed to identify and prevent DDoS attacks in IoT networks. Another approach involves using a feed-forward neural network model to recognize DoS and DDoS attacks, achieving a high accuracy rate. Finally, a new intelligent system employing supervised learning schemes has been developed to distinguish LR-DDoS traffic from legitimate traffic in the SD-IoT ecosystem.

In conclusion, the study has presented, discussed, and evaluated a new intelligent system for investigating the impact of LR-DDoS attacks based on the MQTT protocol in the SD-IoT ecosystem. The proposed system utilizes supervised learning schemes and a new dataset to distinguish LR-DDoS traffic from normal traffic, achieving a high accuracy proportion and swift traffic prediction rate. The paper also outlines potential future research directions, including investigating other types of cyberattacks based on the MQTT protocol in the SD-IoT ecosystem, generating diverse IoT protocol and attack datasets, and exploring mitigation or prevention techniques to provide a fully autonomous security system. Additionally, the analysis of 5G attacks and persistent threats using advanced learning techniques is suggested as a potential area for future investigation.
