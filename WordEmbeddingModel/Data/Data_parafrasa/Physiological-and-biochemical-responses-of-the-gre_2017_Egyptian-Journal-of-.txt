Microalgae, a group of rapidly multiplying unicellular or simple multicellular microorganisms, offer various advantages compared to crop plants, including higher photosynthetic efficiency. They have strong CO2 fixation capacities and can achieve growth rates several times faster than conventional crop plants under optimal culture conditions [1,2]. Additionally, microalgae can fix CO2 from different sources such as the atmosphere, industrial exhaust gases, and fixed CO2 in the form of soluble carbonates (NaHCO3 and Na2CO3). Salinization, caused by high evaporation, is a major environmental factor limiting global crop productivity, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions. It not only occurs in the soil but also in surface water and groundwater due to the presence of chloride and carbonate salts [4,5].

Algal biomass, biodiesel derived from oil, as well as biohydrogen and bioethanol are of great interest. These cellular processes can be affected by abiotic stresses such as sodicity. Although information on the effects of carbonate stress on algae is limited, it is prevalent in water bodies. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the different effects of carbon sources (Na2CO3, NaHCO3) on the growth parameters, CO2 consumption rate, enzyme activity (LOX, SOD, CAT, and HUP), intracellular lipid content, and fatty acid profiles of the green alga Pachycladella chodatii using batch culturing techniques.

The activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD; EC 1.15.1.1) was measured using the autoxidation of epinephrine (adenochrome) method as described by Misra and Fridovich, with some modifications. Furthermore, the total antioxidant capacity of the algal methanol extracts was evaluated using the phosphomolybdenum method, with ascorbic acid (AA) as the standard.

The evaluation of the sum uptake activity of HUP (uptake hydrogenase) and the bidirectional hydrogenase assay mixture was conducted using specific procedures. Studies have shown that inorganic carbon sources can improve carotenoids and lipids content in algal cells by enhancing photosynthetic efficiency and growth rate. Additionally, lipid yield can be influenced by the concentration of inorganic carbon sources.

The analysis of fatty acid methyl ester composition is crucial for selecting species for biodiesel production. Common fatty acids in microalgae include palmitic, stearic, and linolenic acids, with some species accumulating appreciable quantities of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, depending on the cultivation conditions. The composition of fatty acids in algal strains is influenced by various growth conditions, making it challenging to define a single compositional profile for algal-based biodiesel. Furthermore, variations in carbon chain length and unsaturation degree can significantly impact the properties and performance of algal oil for biodiesel production.

In summary, the paper presents a study on the effects of different carbon sources on the growth and biochemical parameters of the green alga Pachycladella chodatii, providing insights into the potential use of microalgae for various applications, including biodiesel production.
