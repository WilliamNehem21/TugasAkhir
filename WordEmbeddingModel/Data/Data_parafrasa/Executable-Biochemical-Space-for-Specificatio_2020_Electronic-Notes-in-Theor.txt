We introduce the next iteration of a rule-based language termed biochemical space language (BCSL), which aims to address various issues in existing solutions by amalgamating different approaches. The language's key feature is its abstract level, facilitating scalable and concise hierarchical specification of biochemical entities. This abstraction allows for distinctive analysis techniques to assess model properties at both the semantic and syntactic levels.

Given the incomplete knowledge of biochemical structures, the language must support the expression of partial knowledge, while also enabling automatic translation of descriptions into formal structures (mathematical or programming) to facilitate simulation and comprehensive analysis of model properties. 

Although SBML Multi transfers rule-based descriptions to a universal XML format, thereby establishing the hierarchical structure of objects and modularity of rules, it does not directly address issues related to executability and advanced analysis, which are fundamental aspects of rule-based frameworks. Consequently, our long-term goal is to develop a comprehensive modeling framework. 

The concept of compatibility between atomic agents, i.e., whether they share the same name and state, or one is in an unknown state, offers a formal mechanism to compare the level of detail between agents. Furthermore, the introduction of structure agents, representing biochemical objects composed of known atomic agents, allows for the incorporation of abstraction in the language. Compatible structure agents are defined based on the creation of unique pairs of atomic agents and their corresponding compatibility. 

Furthermore, complex agents, representing non-trivial composite biochemical objects, are inductively constructed from existing biological objects, usually through the introduction of bonds. In BCSL, we abstract from detailed bond specifications and consider complexes as a coexistence of specific objects within a group. However, the lack of binding topology in complexes, while advantageous in mitigating combinatorial explosion, also poses drawbacks, particularly in expressing structural modifications, which necessitate encoding using states.

The notion of well-formed rules is introduced to ensure semantic coherence, with conditions stipulating that an agent must change during rule application. Additionally, a translation function is defined to establish the semantic meaning of models written in the BCSL syntax.

The introduction of syntactic extensions enhances the readability of rule expressions, showcasing the localisation operator, which enables alternative hierarchical agent expressions, and referencing agent expressions using variables in rule expressions, among others.

Moreover, the formal definition of compatible subsets, identification of redundant rules, model simplification, and static non-reachability analysis are presented as essential techniques for model analysis and optimization. These techniques contribute to the comprehensive understanding and efficient evaluation of biological systems within the framework of BCSL.
