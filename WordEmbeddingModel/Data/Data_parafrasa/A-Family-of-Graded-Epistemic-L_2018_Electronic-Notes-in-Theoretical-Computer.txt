The author posits that she expects to give a sweet to Bob instead of Clara. On a scale of 0 to 5, her expectation is at level 4. This type of expectation is neither true nor false. The paper deals with graded knowledge, where atomic propositions are either true or false.

The paper examines multi-agent epistemic logic for representing and reasoning about agents’ or groups of agents’ knowledge and beliefs. Several proposals have extended these logics with uncertainty, including extensions for reasoning about knowledge and probabilities.

The work by Fitting presents a many-valued modal logic with truth values taken from a lattice. Two semantics are discussed: one where atomic propositions are many-valued and another where the accessibility relation is also many-valued. Additionally, the paper introduces an epistemic logic based on the work of Fitting. It differs from other works in that it deals with a particular lattice. Other related works using complete, distributive lattices as semantics for epistemic and doxastic logics are also highlighted.

The paper introduces a method for constructing graded multi-agent epistemic logics based on action lattices. The use of action lattices allows for a generic space of agent knowledge operators, and enables the representation of a wide range of weighted scenarios. The paper is focused on the epistemic notions of knowledge and their duals.

The structure of the paper is as follows: Section 2 provides background on multi-agent epistemic logic, Section 3 introduces the method for building graded multi-agent epistemic logics, Section 4 illustrates the method with two examples, and Section 5 discusses the validity of classical axioms of multi-agent epistemic logic and outlines future work.

The paper then presents two examples, one dealing with discrete degrees of knowledge and another involving knowledge on a continuous scale.

The remaining axioms of epistemic logic are discussed, focusing on those that distinguish it from other modal logics. Further properties are imposed on the structure of the models to guarantee the validity of certain axioms.

The paper acknowledges that there is still much work to be done in this area of research, particularly in establishing sufficient conditions for validating certain axioms and investigating the concepts of simulation and bisimulation for knowledge representations. The study of complexity of generated epistemic logic with respect to specific classes of action lattices is also highlighted as an area for future research.
