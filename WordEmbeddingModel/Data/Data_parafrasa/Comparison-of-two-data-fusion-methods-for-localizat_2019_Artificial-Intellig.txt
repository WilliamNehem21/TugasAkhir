Shafer and colleagues (2003) introduced the theory of evidence, subsequently known as the Dempster-Shafer theory, which aimed to integrate data into beliefs to manage information deficiencies. This approach was a reinterpretation of Arthur Dempster's research in the 1960s, and according to Dempster, it has been significantly modified by Shafer. Denoeux and colleagues (2017) presented two new division methods and simulated some applications in the Dempster-Shafer (D.S.) method. Liu and colleagues (2017) proposed a new weighting method in the Dempster-Shafer theory using a fuzzy algorithm to classify the target based on evidence obtained from different methods.

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: the kinematic modeling of an agricultural robot, simulation of the robot in MATLAB SimMechanics, and the application of Dempster-Shafer and Kalman filter localization methods are detailed in the materials and methods section. A comparison of these two methods and their results are presented in the results and discussions section. Experimental tests were conducted to verify the validity of the simulation results, and finally, the last section provides some concluding remarks.

The radius of the robot's circular path is observed to increase with the length of the robot, while the steering angle has a mechanical limit and determines the minimum r1 value. When the steering angle is constant, the robot follows a circular arc.

To provide a dynamic environment and visual representation of the robot's motion, the robot model is connected individually in the SimMechanics of MATLAB to observe its behavior when combined with various control algorithms in the Simulink environment. By placing a sensor on the robot to report its position and angles, such as a gyroscope sensor, the robot's features are available throughout the path. The robot moves at a constant velocity, with the steering angle being the only control variable.

The D.S. theory of evidence can be used for precise positioning of moving objects, particularly in localization, by integrating numerical, signal, and multi-dimensional data. The paper demonstrates the use of the D.S. method for localization in a simulation environment, and the performance of the method is compared with the Kalman filter. The Kalman filter shows better performance in the presence of Gaussian noise.

The paper describes the practical implementation of an unmanned ground vehicle for real-time navigation, constructed in the Biosystem Mechanical Engineering Department of Tehran University. The vehicle, used as a mobile robot, has a servo mechanism as its steering mechanism. The mentioned controller has been implemented and the platform is examined in two case studies to verify its practical application.

Mean absolute deviation (MAD) is proposed as a simpler measure of variability than standard deviation and is suggested for use in place of standard deviation due to its better correspondence to real-life scenarios. The forecast accuracy using MAD is closely related to the mean squared error (MSE), where the MAD is more commonly used due to its ease of computation and understanding.

In vehicle localization, the mean deviation from the desired path in path tracking by the Dempster-Shafer method is approximately 15.5 cm in a linear path and about 17 cm in a circular path. This method exhibits an error of about 17.7 degrees in orientation during circular path tracking. Localization using the Kalman filter results in a higher error of about 4.7% in a linear path and about 5% in a circular path.

The paper presents a simulation of controlling an agricultural tractor robot and its localization in real conditions using Dempster-Shafer and Kalman filter algorithms as data fusion tools. The results demonstrate the better performance of the Dempster-Shafer method when applying non-Gaussian noise, validating the method's reliability in conditions close to real-world scenarios. Two paths on crop soil were designed to compare these two data fusion methods for localization in real-world conditions, and the results show the better performance of the Dempster-Shafer method compared to the Kalman filter.
