Virtual learning environments (VLEs) that integrate multiple ICT tools are increasingly popular for delivering distance learning options (Al-Ajlan, 2012). VLEs, which incorporate web-conferencing services, enable real-time lectures to be conducted between students and teachers who are geographically separated. These services support real-time voice communication, using voice over IP, live streaming of web-camera feeds, and sharing multimedia content. The use of such technological services enhances student engagement and is viewed as a viable alternative to traditional in-person learning. The widespread infrastructure and usage of VLEs make them well-suited for the integration of immersive technologies such as virtual reality (VR), which has gained commercial popularity in recent years. Research studies have already reported the positive impact of virtual reality learning environments (VRLEs) on students' engagement and academic performance.

To explore the potential of VRLEs as a distance learning tool, this study investigates the impact of high-fidelity non-verbal communication signals (NVCS) on the learning experience of students in a VRLE. A prototype VRLE was developed to facilitate a lecture by a virtual professor represented by an avatar, which incorporated various NVCS such as body motion, hand and finger gestures, facial expressions, and gaze motion. The data captured from these NVCS were applied to the avatar, which delivered a lecture to a group of 96 university students. Half of the students experienced the full spectrum of the professor's NVCS, while the other half experienced a limited set of NVCS. The students' feedback on the impact of the professor's NVCS fidelity on their learning experience was collected through a questionnaire.

The use of NVCS by professors, such as facial expressions and body language, has been shown to positively influence students' response and behavior during real lectures (Feldman, 1986). Previous studies have highlighted the importance of NVCS in enhancing the quality and effectiveness of the learning experience, while also noting that specific facial expressions, such as those conveying anger, may have a negative impact on student attention. Additionally, studies have found that students' responses to professors' facial expressions, such as smiling and frowning, can significantly influence their learning experience. Furthermore, the absence of social cues in online learning environments, such as conventional VLEs, has been shown to lead to communication uncertainties and feelings of isolation among students. Studies have also demonstrated the positive impact of heightened professor expressiveness on the overall learning experience quality and knowledge acquisition in video lectures.

Several examples of VRLEs incorporating NVCS have been documented in literature, with findings indicating that the presence of facial expressions in virtual lectures can significantly improve students' performance, particularly in difficult-text lectures. Integration of NVCS, such as eye blinking and head posture, has been shown to enhance communication and improve the learning experience quality in VRLEs. However, the successful integration of NVCS in VRLEs may present developmental challenges in terms of sustainability and usability.

The current study introduces a high-fidelity avatar representing a real professor and explores the impact of NVCS on the learning experience in a VRLE. By designing a VRLE that evaluates the impact of the virtual professor's NVCS fidelity on usability, realism, usefulness, social presence, task load, and knowledge acquisition, the study aims to address the necessity and extent of incorporating NVCS into future commercial VRLEs. However, the evaluation results of the study did not show a significant difference in the impact of NVCS on the learning experience between the two groups of students, challenging the previously hypothesized effects of high-fidelity NVCS. The study also suggests that short-term recall of students may not be significantly affected by professors' NVCS in both VLEs and VRLEs.

Ultimately, the findings of this study suggest that the decision to incorporate high-fidelity NVCS in VRLE applications should be carefully considered in terms of the developmental challenges and sustainability, rather than focusing solely on their necessity for ensuring the quality of the learning experience.
