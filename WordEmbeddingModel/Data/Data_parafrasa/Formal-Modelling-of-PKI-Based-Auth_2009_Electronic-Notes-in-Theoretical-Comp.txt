In this paper, our focus is on specific aspects of a PKI system, excluding key generation and revocation-list management. We are particularly interested in authentication operations, the security expertise of the participants, security tokens, and administrative functions, such as user management and trust in certificate authorities. We make the assumption that the PKI system operates within a closed environment, where all users can be identified and hold a single certificate and corresponding private key. Furthermore, there is no need for negotiation of cryptographic algorithms between PKI entities.

To ensure the authenticity of public keys, digital certificates are employed to bind a public key to identifying information about the subject in a way that allows for the verification of its integrity and validity. Digital certificates can be considered as a form of security token for storing, distributing, or transmitting public keys over a public network like the internet. In the context of PKI, the binding between subject and key is established and maintained.

Let [algo] represent the semantics of a cryptographic algorithm, such as AES. For instance, AES's semantic can be described as a function that takes a key and data to be encrypted, and returns the encrypted data.

We assume that the authentication server operates in a closed environment, such as within a bank or university. The server administrator is responsible for maintaining a set of currently registered users. Authentication of users is achieved by validating their certificates, ensuring that they possess the knowledge of the corresponding private key, and checking if their subject name is included in the list of registered users. In open systems, the concept of a registered user set is unnecessary, as any user who can pass the validation and verification phases can be considered authenticated. The abstract state of an authentication server comprises six main components.

Formal methods have been applied in this area, including for specifying, designing, analyzing, and verifying cryptographic protocols, and specifically authentication protocols. Various approaches for applying formal methods to the PKI problem can be found in existing literature. In a previous work, a formal specification of a certificate management system was presented, along with basic operations such as certificate issuing and revocation, using a state-based approach. Additionally, formal security analysis methods have been developed and successfully used to identify security flaws or prove their absence.

This paper formalizes key components of certificate-based PKI to achieve a clear and rigorous understanding and to eliminate ambiguities. These components serve as building blocks to construct a formal model for certificate-based PKI authentication. The formalization of the PKI authentication system is presented by combining aspects of Z and CSP notations. The model's consistency is verified using the ZTC tool.
