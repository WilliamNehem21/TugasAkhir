Artificial intelligence (AI) plays a significant role in bolstering a nation's gross domestic product (GDP) by offering substantial support to the agricultural sector. Several challenges, including climate change, labor shortages, uncertain rainy seasons, natural disasters, and plant diseases, hinder agricultural productivity. The integration of edge intelligence in plant leaf recognition and detection studies has resulted in innovative advancements in deep learning models, particularly the YOLOv3 neural network model. This model, built on an embedded system and the Nvidia Jetson TX2, has been implemented on a drone to capture images of plants, identify pest positions, and apply pesticides as necessary, presenting a novel approach based on deep learning.

Crop losses due to the failure to predict diseases at an early stage lead to reduced production. Therefore, the identification and analysis of crop diseases are critical for maintaining crop quality. Recent advancements in computing speed and power have enhanced the efficiency of systems by leveraging massive datasets.

The use of the COVNET algorithm for weed identification in crops represents a cutting-edge approach. By drawing bounding boxes on cropped images and employing color-based segmentations and genetic algorithms, researchers have developed a hybrid deep learning model that combines deep residual and deep dense networks to reduce training parameters and increase accuracy. Similarly, the application of a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for the detection and recognition of corn leaf diseases has resulted in superior accuracy and performance.

Computer vision (CV) has experienced significant growth with the rise of AI and deep learning technologies. CV-based approaches, including the use of principle component analysis (PCA) and back propagation methods, have enabled the diagnosis of grape leaf diseases with high accuracy. Furthermore, data augmentation through image flipping, cropping, color transformations, and other techniques has expanded the training data available to deep learning models. Faster approaches for detecting grape leaf diseases, such as the DR-IACNN method, have also been developed based on deep learning and data augmentation techniques.

Feature extraction in segmentation involves converting images into a vector of fixed features, including color, texture, and shape. The utilization of convolutional layers in a CNN facilitates the extraction of unique features from images, while pooling layers help to reduce the size of convolved features and minimize computational resources. Additionally, dropout layers are employed to regularize trained models and prevent overfitting.

Model performance is accurately measured using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The use of the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) is also employed to categorize complex data and evaluate model performance. The tuning of hyperparameters, such as the number of epochs, hidden layers, activation functions, and learning rates, significantly impacts model performance and accuracy.

Experimental analyses have been conducted using the Google Colaboratory platform, which supports Python programming and provides access to extensive computational resources. Moreover, the mean average precision (MAP) algorithm, which consists of precision, recall, and mean, is used to assess model performance. The effectiveness of the model is evaluated through validation and testing on new and existing images.

In summary, the integration of AI and deep learning technologies, coupled with advancements in computer vision and deep learning-based augmentation approaches, has led to innovative and highly efficient methods for addressing agricultural challenges, particularly in the areas of plant disease detection, weed identification, and crop quality maintenance. These approaches have demonstrated superior accuracy and performance in various agricultural applications.
