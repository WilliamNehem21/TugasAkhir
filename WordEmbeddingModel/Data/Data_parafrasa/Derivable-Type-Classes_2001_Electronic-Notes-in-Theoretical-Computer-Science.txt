Generic programming enables the creation of a function that can be utilized with various types, without the need to rewrite it for each type. While substantial foundational work has been conducted on generic programming, this paper aims to propose a practical method for supporting generic programming within the Haskell language, without necessitating significant alterations to the language or its type system. The main idea is to introduce generic programming as an expanded language to facilitate the composition of default method definitions in a class declaration.

As previously mentioned, without actual code, we would end up in an infinite loop. Therefore, the focus shifts to seeking a more comprehensive programming language for composing default methods. This article introduces the concept of "generic instance declarations," which are automatically generated by the compiler based on class declarations containing generic default methods. Further details on generic instance declarations are discussed in section 4.3.

Returning to the earlier step, converting the argument to its generic representation type for "showbin" was relatively straightforward. However, "readbin" was more complex because it returned a pair, requiring only one component to be converted. Section 5 elaborates on how the compiler performs this conversion. Additionally, the visibility of our approach to the programmer is further described.

In Haskell, programmers can assign labels to a constructor's components, which are also necessary for "read" and "show" functions. However, for simplicity, this presentation chooses to overlook field names, although they can be handled similarly to constructor names.

This paper specifically addresses single-parameter type classes and assumes, for clarity, that the type of a method op is simply denoted as op a. The introduction of a type synonym can always simplify this notation. For example, let's consider the instance declaration written by the programmer.

It is important to note that the definition provided is not standard Haskell. "bimap" should be viewed as a metafunction that is evaluated at compile time and returns a Haskell expression. It takes a type (written in curly braces) and an environment q that maps type variables to expressions. The syntax [a:= ep-a] represents an environment that binds "a" to "ep-a."

Our design focuses on binary sum and product and does not delve into details about data type constructors and field labels. Moreover, it encapsulates algebraic data types with multiple constructors and fields through nested uses of sum and product, without specifying the exact nesting method. 

Regarding the efficiency of translating a user-defined data type into a generic form before operating on it, the paper explains that aggressive inlining ensures that generic data representations do not exist at runtime. Additionally, it suggests exploring space-time trade-offs by obtaining more compact code in exchange for some data translation on a case-by-case basis.

The paper addresses the translation of a method call op:: op t, emphasizing the need to create a C-dictionary for t if "op" is a method of class C. It mentions the extension of the machinery for constructing the correct dictionary to also accommodate dictionary transformers for higher-order kinded situations.

Finally, the paper acknowledges two primary limitations. Firstly, the intricate nature of implementing generic default methods and bidirectional mapping functions raises concerns. Secondly, the technology to handle constructor and field labels does not seamlessly integrate as expected.
