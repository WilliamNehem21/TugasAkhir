The utilization of residual fully-connected neural networks (RFCN) within the AutoGenome framework has provided a promising foundation for modeling single-omics data. We aim to expand this approach to multiomics research by incorporating the advantages of RFCN neural network architectures, leveraging the AutoML capabilities offered by AutoGenome, and introducing novel multiomics methodologies. In this endeavor, we propose a four-step process: first, the last hidden layers from the single-omics models are concatenated to serve as input for the final multi-omics deep neural network (DNN) model; second, AutoML is employed to train the final multi-omics DNN model with respect to the learning target.

In the context of data integration, we concatenated raw inputs with a multilayer perceptron (MLP) and obtained an F1 score of 0.707. Furthermore, when incorporating a variational autoencoder (VAE), we compared the performance of AutoGenome with other omics strategies, including omics tent along with MLP (F1: 0.728), VAE reconstruction with MLP (F1: 0.733), raw input combined with AutoGenome (F1: 0.725), gene expression coupled with AutoGenome (F1: 0.7315), and gene mutation integrated with AutoGenome (F1: 0.708).

The investigation into gene mutations revealed enrichment in processes such as the bicin or daunorubicin metabolic process, regulation of cell proliferation, growth factor activity, and the Wnt signaling pathway, among others. Additionally, the top 50 ranked gene mutations were found to be enriched in processes related to gene expression regulation, cell proliferation, apoptotic processes, and typical signaling pathways in cancers. Notably, genes associated with expression features showed enrichment in the extracellular space and exosome locations, while genes linked to mutation features were enriched in the mitochondrion and endoplasmic reticulum locations.

The increasing availability of multi-omics data and electronic medical records of individual patients has enabled the study of precision medicine, with the aim of tailoring medical treatments based on personalized clinical responses, physiological characteristics, and genomic features. For complex diseases such as cancer, variations in individual responses to drugs or immune therapy may be attributed to differences in genetic backgrounds, even among patients with the same cancer type based on pathology.

We conducted a comparison between the drug sensitivity model based on AutoGenome and PaccMann using the GDSC data. This comparison was performed using the SMILES of 28 drugs and 936 cell lines shared in the training sets of both models, with GDSC IC50 values serving as the benchmark for evaluation, conducted at both the cell-wise and drug-wise levels.

Furthermore, we independently validated the AutoGenome-based drug sensitivity model using a PDX mice dataset and compared it to Moli. Specifically, we tested the AutoGenome model trained on GDSC IC50 data using tumor size reduction as the learning target in a mice PDX dataset. Performance evaluation was based on the ground truth of tumor size reduction quantity, and the comparison was conducted using four drugs shared between our model and Moli.

The exploration of hyperparameters involved employing a search method described previously in AutoGenome and focused on factors such as learning rate, total batch size, momentum, weight decay, the number of layers in neural networks, and the number of neurons in each layer.

In addition, we investigated the RFCN-DenseNet search space, which encompassed the block structure for DenseNet, the growth rate of neurons in each block, and the dropout ratio of the first layer compared with the input layer. We also explored an efficient neural architecture search (ENAS) method, which involved determining the number of neurons from the 2nd layer to the last layer and the connection relationships between different layers. Both methods drew on approaches previously described in AutoGenome.
