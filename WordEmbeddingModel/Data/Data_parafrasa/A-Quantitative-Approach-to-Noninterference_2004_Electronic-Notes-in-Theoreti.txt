We propose a method for assessing the security of a system based on a formal probabilistic process algebraic approach to noninterference. Our method involves establishing a mathematical model utilizing a linear space of processes and linear transformations on these processes. Within this model, the security measure is represented by the norm of a linear operator associated with the system. Our probabilistic model incorporates reactive and generative features, allowing for probabilistic choices on inputs and outputs. Specifically, noninterference is formulated in terms of a probabilistic notion of weak bisimulation, and we demonstrate how this probabilistic information can be leveraged to estimate the maximal information leakage, i.e., the system's security level against powerful attackers.

We formalize a notion of noninterference based on a similarity relation defined in terms of the observable difference between processes, where observability is rooted in weak probabilistic bisimulation semantics. The maximal observable difference between processes serves as a measure of their indistinguishability, and thus provides a means of quantifying information leakage in our noninterference formalization.

We establish a formal justification for this measure in a mathematical framework where the operational semantics of the probabilistic calculus is expressed in terms of linear operators on a vector space representing the state space. We show that the metric induced by a specific operator norm on process terms aligns with the aforementioned measure, drawing on techniques introduced in prior work.

Our probabilistic model, previously introduced and utilized in prior work, incorporates both probabilities and nondeterminism. It encompasses a mixed generative-reactive model where output actions are governed by a probability distribution, while input actions are influenced by the environment's behavior, resulting in nondeterministic choices.

We elaborate on the standard definition of noninterference, where a high-level user is considered to interfere with a low-level user if the actions of the former impact the observations of the latter. We emphasize the detection of indirect information flows (covert channels) from high to low and describe a formalization of the noninterference approach within the probabilistic process calculus.

Furthermore, we outline how probabilistic information associated with a system's behavior can be utilized to quantitatively estimate potential information leakages, providing a means to assess the efficacy of covert channels responsible for unauthorized information flows.

To illustrate the role of our approximation in assessing the security level of systems and determining worst-case scenarios in terms of maximal information leakage, we offer intuitive examples.

We define linear operators on the vector space containing distributions over the set of states (processes), assuming the set of states is finite for simplicity. However, the presented results can be extended to the general infinite case.
