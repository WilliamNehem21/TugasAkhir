The use of information and communication technology (ICT) systems in power systems is becoming increasingly crucial. While traditional ICT systems mainly encompass office systems, there is a growing number of automation, control, and protection systems that rely on ICT and are closely integrated with the power system. These advanced systems, often referred to as smart grids, offer enhanced flexibility and functionality in normal operation as well as in managing failures and incidents within the grid. It is anticipated that smart grids will be the preferred power system in the future, capable of meeting future demands and strategic goals at both national and international levels.

This paper provides an overview of studies examining the interdependencies and their impact on reliability in the combined power and ICT system. The review, based on a search in selected major archival journals over the last five years, categorizes papers according to the type of interdependencies considered and the methods used to analyze them. By focusing on recent research, the paper aims to highlight the prevailing interests within the research community.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces the combined power and ICT system and defines different categories of interdependencies based on failure types. Section 3 discusses and categorizes methods deemed useful for identifying and analyzing interdependencies, drawing from risk analysis and modeling of critical infrastructures. Section 4 details the literature study and classifies the papers based on the introduced interdependency and method categories. Section 5 presents a summary of the paper's recommendations, followed by the conclusion in Section 6.

The evolving power system increasingly employs advanced monitoring, control, and protection methods, such as synchronized phasor measurements, flexible AC transmission devices, and communication-based protective gear. This includes the utilization of phasor measurement units and wide-area measurement systems, with the expectation that future power systems will also integrate monitoring and control functions down to the consumer level.

The paper underscores the increasing interdependence between power and ICT systems, citing instances where failures in one system impact the other, leading to cascading or escalating failures. The authors propose various methods for identifying and analyzing these interdependencies, encompassing both qualitative and quantitative analyses. Additionally, the paper outlines the challenges faced in conducting a comprehensive systematic review of the current literature, with a focus on research published in three major archival journals. The importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and the need for developing more comprehensive analysis methods to understand these interdependencies is also emphasized.

Finally, the paper emphasizes the need for future research to address the limitations of current methods and to focus on identifying the needs of transmission system operators and distribution system operators for understanding interdependencies and their impacts.
