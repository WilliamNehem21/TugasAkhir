Understanding the causal relationships between actions performed by a process is an important concern for process algebras used in systems biology as it helps to determine the necessary events for another event to occur. This information can be used in various ways, such as determining the order of events and reducing the size of the system to be explored when studying a biological phenomenon. Additionally, in drug research, analyzing causal relations can aid in characterizing the relationships among molecules in a biochemical interaction network and identifying potential drug targets.

Previous work by Busi proposed a causal semantics for the MBD fragment of brane calculus to address various causal dependencies, including standard structural and synchronization causality, as well as environment causality related to the membrane structure and MBD primitives. However, the introduction of annotations on causes in the standard semantics limits its practical application for investigating the causal dependencies in biological systems, as the resulting transition system with causal information is usually quite large or even infinite.

In light of this, static analysis techniques are often used to extract information on the runtime behavior of a system with reduced computational cost, which is particularly beneficial when dealing with the inherent complexity of biological systems. Building upon ideas developed by Busi, this paper proposes an analysis for MBD using abstract interpretation techniques, which has polynomial complexity and is based on an abstract version of the causal semantics. This analysis provides approximate information on all derivatives of the initial system and describes the set of possible causal dependencies among reduction steps, allowing for the proving of causal independence between reduction steps.

The MBD fragment of brane calculus, inspired by membrane fusion and splitting, introduces causal dependencies arising from various actions, including mate, drip, and bud reactions. This paper introduces the syntax and semantics for MBD, presenting a labelled version of the calculus. In addition, the paper describes and classifies different types of causal dependencies in MBD, emphasizing the environment causality introduced by mate reactions, which can lead to changes in the interaction possibilities of child membranes.

To simplify and adapt the causal semantics, the paper defines an abstract version of the causal transition system based on cause names associated with reaction steps and presents illustrative examples of environment causality effects. The objective of the analysis is to compute an over-approximation of all derivatives of a system with causes and an over-approximation of the associated causes for each reaction step, providing a description of the possible hierarchical structure of membranes and processes with causes.

In summary, the analysis based on abstract interpretation techniques can approximate the causal semantics of the MBD fragment of brane calculus and be used to statically verify causality properties of MBD systems. This approach can aid in understanding the causal relationships among membrane interactions and demonstrate the independence of reaction steps from each other.
