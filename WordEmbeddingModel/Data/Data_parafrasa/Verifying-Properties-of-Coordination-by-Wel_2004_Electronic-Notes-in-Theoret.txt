This paper assesses the suitability of a framework for coordination by formally defining the concept of well-structured coordination and its properties, such as termination, boundedness, safety, and liveness. It explores the application of this framework to the linda coordination model and focuses on a methodology for proving safety properties of coordinated systems.

The paper suggests focusing on infinite sets that can be semantically characterized in a finite way to mitigate the issue of infinite carrier sets. It also discusses the compatibility and decidability properties when considering transitions following the semantics of transfer arcs and reset arcs of petri nets.

While the primary practical applications of the well-structured transition system framework lie in security, mutual-exclusion protocols, and cache coherence protocols, the paper proposes that it may also have broader uses in the context of coordination. The coordination problems seem to align with the conditions for applying this framework, as coordination models and languages typically formalize the behavior of coordinated systems and infrastructures using transition systems, taking concurrency aspects and interaction into account.

The paper also discusses the relevance of the linda coordination model, which has been foundational in the development of the coordination field and has been the basis for numerous extensions and adaptations. It presents the linda coordination model as an example due to its simplicity and its potential to extend the results to other coordination models.

The paper introduces the use of the msr(c) tool to automatically verify safety properties by substituting process states with corresponding atomic items and leveraging the tool for safety property verification. It provides an example of identifying and resolving a problem in a coordinated system using backward analysis with the msr(c) tool.

The paper highlights the importance of a rigorous approach to the engineering of systems with complex interaction patterns in the coordination field. Formal models are often used to describe syntax and semantics of coordination languages and to characterize the dynamics of coordination architectures and infrastructures. The paper emphasizes the potential advantages of formal approaches, such as abstracting away from unnecessary details, avoiding the underspecification of relevant aspects, and intercepting design errors. However, the paper argues that the automatic verification of system properties using formal models has not received sufficient attention in the context of coordination models.
