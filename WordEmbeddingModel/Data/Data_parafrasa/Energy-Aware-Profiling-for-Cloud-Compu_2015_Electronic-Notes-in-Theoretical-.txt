The widespread adoption of cloud computing technology has led to a significant increase in the maintenance overhead for the infrastructure, posing a major challenge for cloud providers due to the associated high operational costs, particularly in terms of energy consumption. It has been observed that data centers can consume approximately 100 times more energy than a typical office of similar size. Therefore, effectively managing the power consumed by servers would not only reduce energy usage, but also decrease the heat generated by these servers, thereby reducing the need for energy-intensive cooling resources and resulting in overall energy savings.

Recent studies have begun to scrutinize energy consumption in greater detail, including the measurement of energy usage for each virtual machine (VM) on a physical machine. One such study has proposed a VM power model to estimate the power consumption of VMs using performance events counters, claiming an average accuracy of approximately 97% for their model.

The proposed system architecture involves the real-time measurement of energy consumed by hardware components and the monitoring of the number of assigned VMs. Energy profiling algorithms calculate the energy consumed by each VM and hardware component, and this data is then stored as key performance indicators (KPIs) in a database. The reporting and analysis unit further analyzes this data to provide energy-aware reports to software developers, enhancing their awareness of energy consumption when making programming decisions. For instance, developers can prioritize components with lower energy consumption, such as the CPU or memory, when creating applications, without compromising performance.

The hardware setup used for the study comprises a cluster of Dell commodity servers, each equipped with energy meters. These servers feature a four-core X3430 Intel Xeon CPU, 8GB of RAM, and 250GB SATA HDDs, interconnected via gigabit Ethernet. The servers access a NFS share hosted on the cluster headnode, which is backed by RAID 0-configured HDDs providing a total of 2TB storage for VM images.

The energy profiling unit offers reporting at both host and VM levels, providing historical logs, real-time power values, and future consumption predictions. The historical log details energy consumption over a specified time period, including average power, while current values report power usage alone. Future predictions are based on linear regression of CPU utilization versus power consumption during a training phase at the host level, with automatic calibration features to facilitate this process.

The study reveals that increasing the number of VMs from one to four on a single host leads to an increase in overall power consumption for that host, demonstrating a linear growth in power consumption with the addition of VMs. This is attributed to the increased usage of physical resources, such as CPU, disk, and memory, allocated to these VMs, resulting in corresponding increases in power consumption.

Experimental results demonstrate that power consumption increases linearly with the increment of VMs running on each host, with an application comprising multiple tasks able to run across multiple VMs hosted by different physical machines simultaneously. This emphasizes the impact of VM allocation on power usage across multiple physical hosts.
