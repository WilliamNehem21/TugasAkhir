Section 6 outlines the complete algorithm, while Section 7 discusses the execution of the radial basis function (RBF) on different multimedia data, along with the implementation and results of analytical tests. The study is concluded in Section 8.

An image is represented as a matrix of pixels with varying values, typically ranging from 0 to 255 for each color of each pixel, equating to 8 bits for grayscale images. Bitplanes can be generated using different methods such as binary bitplane decomposition (BBD), grey code bitplane decomposition (GCBD), and fibonacci p-code bitplane decomposition (FBD).

A technique for encrypting images is proposed to preserve correlation in the high-order bitplanes while compressing, utilizing an encryption algorithm that scrambles the bitplanes using chaotic logistic maps. The approach generally involves binary bitplane decomposition (BBD), while alternative techniques are also considered in the suggested algorithms.

To enhance unpredictability and complexity in the encryption process, frame rotation is applied to each bit plane separately using the original keys. Frames are defined as the 1-pixel border square/rectangle of a plane at a specific distance from the edge, and are rotated in a circular manner in the clockwise direction by a certain count.

This process is repeated for three rounds, with block sizes of 64x64, 32x32, and 16x16 for each respective round. Following this process, the original image, or decrypted image, is reconstructed.

The time complexity of the algorithm pertains to the total time required for encrypting an image, which increases as the size of the image grows. The time complexity is therefore a function of the image size. Data displayed in the paper illustrates the time taken for the encryption process for various images.

The combination of these methods enables the algorithm to withstand various attacks. The RBF algorithm is completely lossless, as the information in the image can be recovered entirely after decryption. It is flexible, capable of working on images of any size, and is robust enough for everyday use. The paper provides a detailed evaluation and analysis of the RBF algorithm.
