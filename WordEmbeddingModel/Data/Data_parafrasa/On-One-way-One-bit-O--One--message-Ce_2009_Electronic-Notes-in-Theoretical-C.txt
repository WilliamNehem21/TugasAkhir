Cellular automata consist of interconnected finite automata arranged in one-dimensional arrays, known as cells. This paper examines real-time one-way cellular automata, which form the weakest class of cellular automata. Two constraints are imposed on inter-cell communication: a limit on the number of times links between cells can be used, and a restriction on the amount of information that can be communicated in a single time step. The study focuses on cellular automata with one-way information flow, where each cell receives one bit of information exactly once. The authors provide a characterization of regular languages for unary alphabets and discuss the acceptance of non-context-free languages for non-unary alphabets in this context. Additionally, the paper explores the language hierarchy that emerges when the number of allowed uses of inter-cell links is increased incrementally. Decidability problems of these restricted cellular automata are investigated, and it is shown that almost all problems are undecidable, even in the most restricted case of one-way one-bit communication.

The computational capacity of homogeneous, interconnected, parallel acting automata has been widely studied. In particular, the paper emphasizes previous research on cellular automata – linear arrays of identical copies of deterministic finite automata – which work synchronously at discrete time steps.

The study of two-way cellular automata with bounded proper state changes has been conducted to investigate the power of communication. Real-time one-way cellular automata, where communication is quantitatively measured by the number of uses of communication links between cells, have also been explored. The paper combines these two approaches and examines real-time one-way cellular automata that are restricted to communicate only a fixed, finite number of bits per time step, with communication links between cells allowed to be used a limited number of times.

Furthermore, the study delves into real-time one-way cellular automata with minimal communication, specifically the family lrt(mc(1)-oca1). It is shown that even with minimal input, one communication symbol and one use of the links are sufficient for such automata to accept languages.

The authors also present examples to demonstrate the capacity of real-time one-way cellular automata in accepting non-regular languages, as well as regular languages that cannot be accepted by any real-time cellular automata with 1-bit communication.

The paper concludes with discussions on the undecidability of almost all decidability problems for k-bit one-way cellular automata, as well as implications for other variations of cellular automata with different measures on the number of communications.
