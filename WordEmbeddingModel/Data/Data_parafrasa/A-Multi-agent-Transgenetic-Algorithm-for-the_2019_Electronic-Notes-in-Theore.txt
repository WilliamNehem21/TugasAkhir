The bi-objective spanning tree (BIST) is an extension of the minimum spanning tree (MST) problem and is known to be NP-hard. It addresses scenarios where two competing objectives need to be optimized simultaneously. Previous research has explored BIST and proposed various evolutionary heuristic algorithms to tackle the problem, with transgenetic algorithms being among the successful approaches. However, the use of pre-defined parameters in these algorithms can constrain the search mechanisms. In this study, we introduce a novel transgenetic algorithm for BIST, where the selection of search mechanisms is dynamically determined during its execution. Computational experiments conducted on 165 benchmark instances demonstrate that the proposed algorithm yields high-quality approximation sets based on two distinct quality indicators.

The newly introduced transgenetic algorithm, referred to as TLP, proves to be an effective method for addressing BIST. When compared to a state-of-the-art algorithm introduced by [author's name], the TLP produces superior results. Transgenetic algorithms simulate natural mechanisms such as horizontal gene transfer and endosymbiosis, with the exchange of genetic material between a host cell and a population of endosymbionts metaphorically represented by transgenetic agents. These agents manipulate solutions within the algorithm, which maintains a population of endosymbionts, a repository of information, and transgenetic agents. The TLP employs two types of transgenetic agents: plasmids and transposons, as detailed in section [section number].

In the generation of endosymbionts using the Rmcprim method, repeated endosymbionts are not accepted, while dominated spanning trees are accepted with a probability of 60%. However, these restrictions do not apply when the population is generated with the random walk method, which iteratively constructs a tree by uniformly selecting a random edge that connects a node already included in the tree with a node not yet included.

Transgenetic agents play a crucial role in modifying solutions during the search conducted by a transgenetic algorithm. Various types of transgenetic agents, aimed at diversifying or intensifying the search, exist. This study presents a transgenetic algorithm with automatic control over the selection of agents to manipulate endosymbionts from the current population, as outlined in the procedure TMA pseudo-code.

The TMA method used for creating the initial population is consistent with the approach employed by TLP, with seven plasmids and three transposons implemented. Initially, their success rates are set to 0. The TMA was compared against TLP and a well-established genetic algorithm, NSGA-II, for bi-objective problems. The Friedman test was applied to assess significant differences among the solutions produced by these algorithms, followed by the Holm posthoc test to identify specific differences between TMA and the other algorithms, with a significance level set at 0.05.

To enable the algorithm to autonomously select plasmids or transposons in the first iteration, the level parameter is set to 0.5. Additionally, an external archive is limited to 300 solutions and is updated using the adaptive grid technique proposed by [author's name]. The crossover and mutation rates for the NSGA-II algorithm, tuned with the iRACE, are 0.97 and 0.04, respectively, with a population size of 150 consistent with TLP and TMA.

For most cases where TMA outperformed others, the Holm posthoc test indicated significant differences, except for certain instances where TLP or NSGA-II exhibited exceptions in solution quality. The contributions of different transgenetic agents to the search were also analyzed, highlighting the success rates of plasmids and transposons in diverse problem instances.

In conclusion, the proposed transgenetic algorithm with automatic agent selection demonstrates superiority in solution quality and processing time compared to existing methods, with the potential for extension to many-objective problems in future research.
