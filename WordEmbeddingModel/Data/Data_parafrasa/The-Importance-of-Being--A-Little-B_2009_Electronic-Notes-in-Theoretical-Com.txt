This research paper compares and contrasts three different semantics for stochastic concurrent constraint programming (SCCP), with a focus on the exhibited behavior of models and their robustness. The study investigates two case studies, a circadian clock model and the repressilator, to comment on the impact of introducing a limited amount of discreteness in the description of biological systems with hybrid automata. Experimental evidence suggests that discreteness increases the robustness of the models.

The main objective of the paper is to initiate an investigation into the implications of the three different semantics of SCCP. Specifically, the study concentrates on examining the exhibited dynamical behavior and system robustness. The focus is on systems expected to oscillate in alternating phases, and the research aims to determine if oscillations are preserved when kinetic parameters governing the dynamics are perturbed.

Two case studies are discussed, namely the repressilator and a simplified model of the circadian clock. The comparison involves stochastic, differential, and hybrid SCCP models, along with a robustness analysis of the latter. The study also explores the effect on the stability of oscillations caused by introducing a small degree of discreteness and stochasticity.

Additionally, the paper provides an overview of SCCP and hybrid automata, with a brief description of their fundamentals and features. The discussion also addresses the role of discreteness and stochasticity in stabilizing the circadian clock.

The findings suggest that robustness is enhanced by the discrete treatment of gene repression or enhancement, leading to a more accurate qualitative description without significantly increasing the computational cost of simulation. The paper also proposes a generalized mapping from SCCP to hybrid automata, allowing for variable levels of discreteness and emphasizing the potential for identifying key discrete transitions in the lattice.

This approach has potential connections with hybrid simulation algorithms for multiscale systems and may provide new insights into these methods. Additionally, the introduction of parametric stochasticity is considered, leading to the association of an SCCP program with a lattice of stochastic hybrid automata. This approach may offer new perspectives on these simulation methods.
