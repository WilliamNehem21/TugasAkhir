This research work focuses on the issue of cooperation in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) and its impact on reliable data dissemination. The presence of selfish nodes can disrupt cooperation and diminish network performance, making it necessary to assess the reputation level of each node to inform routing decisions effectively. Accordingly, a novel Laplace-Stieltjes transform-based Conditional Survivability Coefficient Model (LCSCM) is proposed to manage network survivability through a parameter called the Conditional Survivability Coefficient (CSC). This parameter helps determine the reputation level of mobile nodes and quantifies the overall survivability of the network. The study evaluates the performance of this model using simulations based on NS-2, considering various network-related parameters such as packet delivery ratio, throughput, total overhead, and control overhead. The results demonstrate that the LCSCM outperforms the PCMA model, achieving a successful detection rate of 24% and facilitating the detection of selfish nodes.

Efficient data dissemination among mobile nodes in multi-hop networks, such as ad hoc networks, requires a high level of collaboration. However, the dynamic nature of mobile nodes in MANETs can disrupt cooperation, highlighting the need to periodically assess the reputation level of nodes to gauge cooperation. The proposed LCSCM model leverages the Laplace-Stieltjes transform to estimate the reputation level of nodes and isolate selfish nodes through the calculation of the Conditional Survivability Coefficient (CSC), which is based on second-hand information obtained from neighboring nodes. This model also measures the survivability of individual nodes based on parameters for computing the failure rate of cooperative and selfish nodes. The study utilizes the AODV protocol to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed model.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews related work on detecting selfish nodes based on reputation factors computed using probability. Section 3 presents the Laplace-Stieltjes transform-based Conditional Survivability Coefficient Model. Section 4 outlines the algorithms used to deploy the model in an ad hoc environment. Section 5 provides an illustration of the proposed model, while sections 6 and 7 detail the setup for evaluation parameters and experimental analysis, respectively. The major contributions of the proposed model are discussed in section 7.3, and the paper concludes in section 8.

Several related studies are discussed within the context of MANETs and reputation-based node evaluation, including schemes proposed by Buchegger and Boudec, Kargl et al., Rizvi and Elleithy, Marti et al., Chen and Varatharajan, Michiardi and Molva, and Hernandezorallo et al.

The proposed LCSCM model's effectiveness lies in its utilization of the Conditional Survivability Coefficient (CSC) to estimate reputation levels and assess the impact of selfish nodes on network survivability. Algorithm 3 outlines the steps for estimating CSC using Laplace-Stieltjes transform and probability theorems. The model is shown to effectively mitigate selfish nodes, with a threshold value for rehabilitation set at 0.01 based on simulation results. The proposed approach allows for the detection of selfish nodes without false negative or false positive probabilities.

The study demonstrates that the LCSCM model consistently outperforms the PCMA model, with a notable successful detection rate of 24%. Through extensive simulations, the model has shown superiority in various network performance metrics compared to existing models. The threshold values for detecting selfish nodes are determined to be between 0.20 and 0.30, highlighting the proposed LCSCM's efficacy in this regard. Overall, the LCSCM model provides an improved approach for detecting selfish nodes in MANETs and assessing network survivability.
