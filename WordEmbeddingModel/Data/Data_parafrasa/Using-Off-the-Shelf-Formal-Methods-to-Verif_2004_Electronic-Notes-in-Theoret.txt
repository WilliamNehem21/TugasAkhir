The paper discusses different approaches to validating formal properties of grammars. While the authors are currently focused on developing integrated development environments for attribute grammars and utilizing program slicing methods to aid visualization, the paper concentrates on the formal analysis of attribute grammar properties. Rather than modifying existing attribute grammar systems to incorporate additional feedback, the authors have opted to leverage an off-the-shelf formal methods tool. By using formal methods, the authors aim to describe software properties and assertions independently of specific programming languages, thus allowing the analysis tool to be utilized with different languages. The authors emphasize that formal methods tools can be more efficient in implementing solutions compared to modifying existing generators and can help maintain the modularity of the overall system.

The paper's approach is based on formal relational models supported by the alloy model finding and checking tool. The authors highlight the tool's capability to provide counterexamples to illustrate violations of assertions, and they demonstrate its application in analyzing general and specific properties of the grammars under study. The authors emphasize the importance of scalability in formal models of software and stress the need to control scalability by ensuring that the model specification is not overly specific. They evaluate the performance of their analysis on an attribute grammar that specifies the semantic analysis for a subset of Pascal and present further modifications that significantly improve performance.

The authors also discuss the use of proof assistants, which guide users through logical deductions related to software specification, and model checkers, which verify the correctness of a system and provide counterexamples to illustrate the falsity of assertions. While acknowledging the varying levels of automation available with different proof assistants, the authors note that successful use of a proof assistant can establish significant information about the problem at hand. On the other hand, model checkers do not provide much additional information about a correct software description but can identify counterexamples to assist during the software development process.

Instead of relying on traditional proof assistants or model checkers, the authors have based their work on the alloy tool, which provides some of the advantages of both formal methods. The authors introduce the alloy specification language and highlight its use in generating models that satisfy the specified constraints and checking the truth of assertions in those models. They also discuss the implementation of their techniques in an eli-specific tool and evaluate the approach in the context of a specific attribute grammar setting.

The paper presents a detailed examination of the alloy specification language using a simple model specification of families as an example. The authors demonstrate the generation of counterexamples by alloy when certain assertions fail, and they emphasize the importance of adding additional constraints to the specification to address such failures.

The authors also discuss their work on analyzing a specific grammar that performs semantic analysis for a subset of Pascal. They provide insights into the performance of their analysis, including the time taken to analyze different aspects of the grammar. The authors also discuss potential improvements to their approach, including targeting the analysis towards specific problematic includings and calculating the maximum scope needed for a specific grammar.

Finally, the authors acknowledge the input and consultation received from various experts in the field, which contributed to the development and evaluation of their approach.
