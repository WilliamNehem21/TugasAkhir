The consumption of small berries such as strawberries and blueberries is widespread due to their unique flavors, appearances, and potential health benefits, which also contributes to their economic value. This review discusses several optical non-destructive techniques, including vis-NIR spectroscopy, computer vision system, hyperspectral imaging, multispectral imaging, laser-induced methods, and thermal imaging, and their applications for assessing the quality and safety of small berry fruits. Additionally, the paper presents a discussion on the photoacoustic technique, x-ray technique, terahertz spectroscopy, odor imaging, micro-destructive testing, and smart mobile terminal-based analyzer in the context of small berry fruit evaluation. The authors also suggest technical challenges and future trends for these optical non-destructive techniques.

The use of non-destructive testing techniques for quality and safety control of small berry fruits is seen as a way to consistently and safely produce nutritious products, thus increasing their economic value. Optical non-destructive approaches are based on analyzing signals that have interacted with the testing materials and have garnered significant scientific and industrial attention over the last two decades.

One of the main limitations of spectroscopic techniques is the lack of spatial information. Although some efforts have been made to incorporate spatial data using spatially-resolved spectroscopy, these techniques may not fully meet the increasing experimental demand for analyzing nonhomogeneous biological materials. In contrast, computer vision can operate in the spatial dimension, making it suitable for detecting external material quality, particularly for heterogeneous samples.

The reliability of computer vision technique can be affected by inconsistent ambient illumination and complex background. To address these issues, researchers have proposed novel methods such as using a stepwise algorithm to identify the maturity stages of blueberries under natural outdoor lighting conditions on the branch, or using flashlights for exposure compensation. Studies have also successfully applied computer vision to sort bayberries into healthy and bruised categories and to evaluate the appearance quality of gooseberries for export purposes.

Future research opportunities are focusing on multi-dimensional vision techniques, such as using 3-dimensional scanners to estimate the surface area and volume of irregularly shaped fruits like strawberries. Additionally, researchers are exploring the use of ultraviolet light to capture fluorescence images of strawberries to estimate fluorescent phenolic compound levels, suggesting that expanding the light source beyond the visible spectral range may broaden the application scope of computer vision systems.

Other laser-excited techniques, such as laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy, have been used to quantify the contents of specific compounds in blueberries, while photoacoustic spectroscopy has been employed to monitor variations in ethylene gas release in organic and nonorganic raspberry and strawberry fruits. Similarly, X-ray techniques have been applied to differentiate between frozen and defrosted blueberry and blackberry fruits, among other purposes in the food and agricultural domain.

The paper also acknowledges that further research is needed to address technical challenges in utilizing terahertz reflectance spectroscopy for evaluating blueberry quality, such as overcoming attenuation by water and scattering by inhomogeneous media. Additionally, the authors express gratitude to individuals and organizations that have supported their research efforts.
