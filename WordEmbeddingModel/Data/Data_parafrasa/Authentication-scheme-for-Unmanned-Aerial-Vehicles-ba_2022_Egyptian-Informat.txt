The development of new and advanced technologies has led to the emergence of exciting areas such as the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). These technologies aim to enhance the user experience by providing faster and more convenient data communication services. However, due to the open nature of these networks, security and user privacy have become significant concerns. Various types of security attacks, such as jamming attacks, global positioning system jamming, signal jamming, and data jamming, have been observed in these networks. While existing solutions have been designed to address security issues such as authenticity, data integrity, message authentication, and redundant authentication, they have limitations in terms of computational costs and efficiency, and fail to provide security at all levels.

In response to these challenges, this paper proposes a novel authentication scheme, Efficient Authentication Scheme for Safety Applications for Internet of Vehicles (EASSAIV), to address message authentication in IoV. The proposed scheme aims to gather, process, and verify the information exchanged between roadside units, UAVs, and vehicles, and authenticate the received messages. The results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms existing schemes in terms of safety, packet loss, delay, and computational cost.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of related studies and research articles relevant to the proposed research. Section 3 elaborates on the proposed mechanism, including its working, security model, and authentication protocol. Section 4 presents the results and analysis, while the last section concludes the paper and outlines future directions.

Furthermore, several related works are reviewed in this paper. One such work is the Secure Authentication Scheme for VANETs with Batch Verification (SAS-VANET), which aims to ensure secure communication in vehicular ad hoc networks. Another work addresses privacy-preserving sensory data sharing in IoV networks, aiming to preserve location privacy and ensure data integrity. Additionally, an enhanced anonymity resilience security protocol for vehicular ad hoc networks is discussed, focusing on protecting private information and addressing various security attacks.

The proposed EASSAIV scheme employs asymmetric encryption techniques to secure information exchange between vehicles and drones, based on three main phases: initial deployment, implementation, and operational phases. The scheme leverages timestamp and nonce values to prevent replay attacks and ensures secure communication between vehicles and drones.

The proposed scheme is evaluated using the Avisp...
