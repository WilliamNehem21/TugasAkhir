The validation methodologies are typically viewed as a unified approach, primarily focusing on the specification aspect. To enhance this approach, we introduce additional focus operators, with a recommendation to specify the input/output relation on streams based on time intervals in most cases. Considering argumentation over time intervals of streams offers a clearer understanding in many scenarios.

In the context of a distributed system, its components are interconnected by communication lines referred to as channels and can collaborate or operate independently. These channels are asynchronous, directed, reliable, and preserve the order of messages. The formal meaning of a focus specification is the relationship between the communication histories of the external input and output channels. These specifications can be organized into various formulas, each characterizing different types of properties.

The validation of a system can be viewed as proving that a more specific system specification refines a more abstract one. This involves demonstrating that the system specification is consistent with the abstract specification.

The specifications labeled as l1 and l2 do not imply r, as they do not provide information about the message values. The component sample embodies the logic of the gateway component, which initiates a call to the emergency service center upon receiving a command from a vehicle's ecall application. The component delay models communication delay and inherits parameters from the gateway component.

The optimized proof consists of approximately 1500 lines, and the proofs of the new auxiliary lemmas exhibit similarity to the proofs of the corresponding parts of lemma gatewaysystem l0. Furthermore, the optimized proof of the corresponding lemma gatewaysystem l0ext comprises around 300 lines.

This paper introduces the concept of refinement-based verification, where any proof of a system can be seen as evidence that a more specific system specification refines a more abstract one. This also applies to proving a single property of a system specification.
