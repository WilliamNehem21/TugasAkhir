An essential aspect of computer-aided medical diagnosis involves automatically detecting lung abnormalities in digital chest x-rays, representing a crucial initial step in radiologic image analysis. Technological advancements in digital technology and chest radiography have led to the creation of extensive repositories containing labeled and unlabeled images. Semi-supervised learning algorithms have garnered significant attention as they leverage information from both labeled and unlabeled images. In this study, we propose a new semi-supervised learning algorithm for classifying lung abnormalities in x-rays based on an ensemble approach. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, highlighting the potential for developing reliable prediction models through the incorporation of ensemble methodologies in the semi-supervised framework.

Another review by Mansoor et al. discussed the capabilities and performance of existing methods for segmenting lungs with pathological conditions in chest tomography images. They categorized lung field segmentation methods into five broad groups, providing an overview of the advantages and disadvantages associated with each method.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 offers a brief overview of semi-supervised self-labeled algorithms, while Section 3 provides a detailed description of the proposed algorithm. Section 4 presents a series of experiments conducted to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed algorithm compared to popular self-labeled classification algorithms. Finally, Section 5 presents the conclusions and outlines potential research topics for the future.

Self-labeled methods, a prominent subset of semi-supervised learning methods, address the scarcity of labeled data by employing a self-learning process based on supervised prediction models. Triguero et al. proposed a comprehensive taxonomy based on the main characteristics of self-labeled algorithms and conducted an extensive study on their classification performance across multiple datasets. Notably, these algorithms often draw inspiration from ensemble methodologies and techniques.

Ensemble self-labeled algorithms, such as self-training, co-training, tri-training, co-bagging, and democratic-co learning, have been proposed in the literature. These algorithms combine individual predictions using majority voting methodologies. Our proposed algorithm is based on the idea of generating a set of n self-labeled classifiers using different algorithms and model representations, with their individual predictions combined through majority voting.

In our experimental evaluation, our proposed algorithm, referred to as ENSL, demonstrated superior performance compared to other popular self-labeled algorithms, such as self-training, co-training, tri-training, co-bagging, CST-voting, co-forest, and democratic-co learning. We conducted a statistical comparison between all compared semi-supervised self-labeled algorithms and observed that ENSL consistently performed the best, particularly in terms of accuracy and F1 metrics.

The proposed algorithm was extensively evaluated on chest x-rays (pneumonia) and CT medical images datasets, showcasing its efficiency and classification accuracy, as confirmed by statistical tests. Thus, our research suggests that reliable and robust classification models can be developed through the adaptation of ensemble methodologies in the semi-supervised learning framework.
