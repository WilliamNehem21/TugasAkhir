Recommender systems are commonly utilized by various popular e-commerce websites, such as Amazon and eBay, to assist users in discovering products that may be of interest to them. However, most recommender systems are designed to operate on centralized platforms supported by fixed internet infrastructure. Therefore, further investigation is necessary to assess the suitability and performance of recommender systems in challenging environments characterized by dynamic network topology and variable transmission delays. This study focuses on the development of a recommender system suitable for a delay-tolerant network, where communication occurs through opportunistic encounters between participating nodes. The proposed approach integrates collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to generate rating predictions for users. To enhance the system's tolerance against interruptions, each node maintains a local recommender that generates predictions using user profiles obtained through opportunistic exchanges over a clustered topology. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach can enhance coverage and alleviate the cold-start problem.

The ease of constructing user profiles is simplified by collaborative filtering, as it involves compiling a list of items that the user has rated, along with their corresponding ratings, thereby avoiding the complexity of weighing terms and determining their relevance in representing user interests. Collaborative filtering faces a cold-start problem when dealing with new users or new items, making it challenging to find similar users for effective recommendations or provide recommendations for new items lacking sufficient data.

This study specifically addresses the design of a recommender system for a delay-tolerant digital marketplace environment, where the dynamic nature of the network presents challenges for implementing a recommender system. In the absence of a central entity, recommendation processing needs to be distributed across mobile participating nodes, and the hybrid approach aims to balance recommendation accuracy and coverage. The proposed system leverages node clusters to facilitate message propagation throughout the network and incorporates modifications to accommodate the dynamic nature of the network.

During the prediction phase, each node operates its own local recommender to generate item predictions, relying on the data stored in its local database. The propagation of user profiles is highly dependent on the dynamic formation of clusters, with distinct responsibilities for nodes based on their specific roles in the cluster.

Experiments are conducted to compare the performance of the proposed hybrid recommender system with a reference algorithm in controlled and delay-tolerant network setups, focusing on factors such as coverage and mean absolute error (MAE) as the system gathers the profiles of more similar users in the network.

The results show that while the MAE of both approaches does not consistently decrease as more similar users' opinions are considered, the coverage of both approaches increases as the recommender system considers the ratings of more similar users. The proposed hybrid approach demonstrates potential in improving the performance of the reference algorithm in a delay-tolerant environment, highlighting its viability in challenging network conditions.
