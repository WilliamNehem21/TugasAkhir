This academic paper, originally focused on natural systems, quickly became recognized as an inspiring metaphor for artificial systems as well. One key aspect of emergent properties is that, by definition, they cannot be achieved through systematic design; their dynamics and outcomes cannot be fully predicted. However, some design support in this context is still feasible. The entire system of interest, which includes the application and the environment, can be represented as a stochastic system, where the dynamics and duration aspects are probabilistic. In this scenario, simulations can be utilized as a valuable tool to predict certain aspects of the system's behavior and to facilitate appropriate design prior to the actual implementation of the application.

This situation is particularly relevant for coordination models and languages. Works such as TOTA middleware, SwarmLinda, and Stochastic Klaim, although originating from different perspectives, all build on the notion of extending standard coordination models with features related to adaptivity and self-organization. They all share the concept that tuples in a tuple space spread to other tuple spaces in a non-deterministic manner, depending on timing and probability. Therefore, the aim is to explore the potential role of simulation tools in this context and to identify a methodological approach to system design.

Another example architecture is the SwarmLinda coordination model, which, although similar to TOTA, is more influenced by swarm intelligence and stigmergy. In SwarmLinda, ant-like algorithms are utilized to retrieve tuples in the distributed system, reflecting the need for adaptivity in dealing with openness and the unpredictability of user interactions.

In particular, based on the work on foundational calculi for interaction, the stochastic dimension is identified as crucial in system modeling. A stochastic system is one where the evolution in time is random. This randomness can be used to abstract away from implementation-specific issues by indicating that a process will take some time to execute, while also accounting for the variability in the advancement of time.

The paper then proceeds to define various types, constructors, and predicates necessary for system modeling, including the concepts of system states, actions, effects, observations, simulation steps, and simulation traces. Furthermore, the implementation of simulation engine behaviors and the utilization of stochastic functions are detailed.

The paper also discusses a multi-agent system where agents are tasked with collecting and moving items within an environment to cluster them according to a shared criterion, which resembles the problem of clustering in coordination models and languages. The potential strategies for this behavior, inspired by social insects such as ants, are explored, along with the use of simulations to evaluate the system dynamics and measure the system order using spatial entropy.

Overall, the paper highlights the application of stochastic modeling and simulation tools in the context of coordination models and languages, and their potential to support system design and analysis.
