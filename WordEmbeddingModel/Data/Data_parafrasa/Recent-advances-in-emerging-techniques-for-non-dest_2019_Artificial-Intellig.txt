In recent years, there has been significant advancement in imaging and spectroscopy techniques, which have found widespread applications in non-destructive determination of agro-food quality. Seeds play a crucial role in agricultural and forestry, with seed viability being a key indicator of seed quality, reflecting the potential for seed germination. As a result, there is a pressing need for quick and effective methods to assess the germination condition and viability of seeds prior to cultivation, sale, and planting. Various studies have explored the use of spectra and image processing and analysis to assess the external and internal quality of different types of seeds. Many efforts have been made to predict seed quality using a range of traditional and innovative methods, focusing on image segmentation and spectra correction techniques. This review centers on introducing, developing, and applying emerging techniques for analyzing seed viability, particularly near infrared spectroscopy, hyperspectral and multispectral imaging, Raman spectroscopy, infrared thermography, and soft x-ray imaging. The review covers the fundamental theories, principal components, relative chemometric processing, analytical methods, and prediction accuracies, while also discussing the technical challenges and future prospects for these emerging techniques.

The concept of seed vigor involves various characteristics and factors, including genetic constitution, environmental conditions during seed development, and storage, which makes it challenging to establish a precise definition. Therefore, most research has focused on detecting seed viability rather than seed vigor using emerging non-destructive techniques, such as near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy, hyperspectral imaging (HSI), multispectral imaging (MSI), Raman spectroscopy (RS), infrared thermography (IRT), and soft x-ray imaging. Hence, this paper reviews the applications and trends of these techniques in seed viability detection.

However, the absorption peaks in the visible and near infrared (Vis/NIR) regions, derived from the fundamental vibrations of chemical bonds, are broad and overlapping, making the interpretation of Vis/NIR spectra with complex mixtures difficult. Additionally, NIR spectra are significantly weaker than their corresponding fundamental mid-infrared absorption bands, making it challenging to extract analytical information from them due to their multivariate nature. As a result, advanced chemometric algorithms are required to extract information rapidly and efficiently.

Several multivariate regression methods, such as partial least squares (PLS) regression, support vectors regression (SVR), artificial neural networks (ANN), and least squares-support vector machines (LS-SVM), along with qualitative multivariate methods like k-nearest neighbor (KNN), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA), and support vector machine (SVM) have been employed for data analysis and classification based on NIR spectroscopy. When evaluating the viability of Norway spruce and corn seeds, it was found that the NIR range was more informative than the Vis/NIR range for seed viability sorting.

Multispectral imaging combined with normalized canonical discriminant analysis (NCDA) was utilized to distinguish viable seeds from dead seeds, resulting in 92% accuracy and 96% correct classification of seeds in the validation set. Raman spectroscopy was found to be useful for classifying viable and non-viable seeds, with derivative preprocessing methods showing the highest accuracy (100%) in the calibration model. Infrared thermography (IRT) was also found to be promising for non-destructive and labor-intensive seed-sorting situations.

X-ray computed tomography (CT) scanning was used to analyze the internal morphological characteristics of seeds, and it was found that CT imaging has the potential to classify seeds based on their internal characteristics. The review emphasizes the importance of non-destructive evaluation systems for assessing seed viability and highlights their rapid, accurate, and reliable nature. The challenges and future trends for these emerging techniques are also discussed.
