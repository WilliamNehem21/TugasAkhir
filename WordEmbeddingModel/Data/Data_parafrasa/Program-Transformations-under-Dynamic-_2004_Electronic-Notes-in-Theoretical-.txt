This scholarly paper introduces a novel static analysis method for programming languages equipped with access control mechanisms based on stack inspection. This analysis offers the potential for various security-focused program optimizations. A distinctive aspect of our static analysis is its adaptability to the prevailing security policy, eliminating the need for re-evaluation when access rights are dynamically adjusted.

Traditionally, stack inspection has been implemented using a lazy evaluation strategy, in which the call stack is only retrieved and examined during access control tests. However, this approach has certain drawbacks, including potential runtime overhead and its impact on interprocedural program transformations such as method inlining.

The paper highlights that the Java security architecture from version 1.4.1 onwards permits dynamic security policies, enabling the binding between a class and its permissions to be deferred until the class is involved in an access control test, while still allowing static permission binding.

The proposed static analysis for stack inspection presented in this paper is specifically designed to address the challenges posed by dynamic security policies. The paper represents programs using control flow graphs, an abstract model not tied to any specific programming language. These graphs are extracted from actual bytecode through available control flow analyses and encompass primitive constructs for method invocation, exceptions, and stack inspection-based access control.

The paper also discusses the dynamic instantiation of permissions in Java, explaining that parametric permissions take the form of p(x), where x spans the set of potential targets for the permissions of class p. It also addresses how a new thread in Java inherits the access control context of its parent upon creation, preventing a child thread from obtaining access not granted to its ancestors during stack inspection.

The authors emphasize that their proposed analysis only accommodates code-centric security policies, granting permissions to code based on its source, irrespective of the executor. They mention the JAAS extension, which introduces user-centric access control policies based on the running principal and the "doas" method, enabling a piece of code to be executed on behalf of a specified subject.

The paper details the computational complexities associated with the proposed static analysis and highlights the potential for code optimizations while being mindful of security implications, including the need for revalidation of program transformations upon updates to the security policy.

Furthermore, it explains specific code optimizations, such as dead code elimination and method inlining, while underscoring the necessity for revalidation of these optimizations when the security policy changes.

Finally, the paper discusses related work by other researchers on formalizing classes of security properties, proposing alternative semantics of eager stack inspection, and addressing the limitations of existing analysis techniques, presenting avenues for future research.
