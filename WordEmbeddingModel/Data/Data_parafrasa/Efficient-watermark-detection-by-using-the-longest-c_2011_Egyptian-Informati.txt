H.264 represents a development in video coding standards, created to address the increasing demand for more efficient compression of moving images. It is a joint effort by ITU-T VCEG and ISO/IEC MPEG, and has been shown to achieve higher bit rates and lower distortion ratios compared to MPEG-2. This paper refers to the standard as H.264.

The challenge of watermark robustness involves a conflict between those embedding the watermark and attackers seeking to remove or corrupt it, without significantly affecting the original media. This paper extends previous work by addressing watermark desynchronization issues and presenting embedding and detection models, as well as desynchronization attack models. A modified embedding and detection algorithm is introduced to counter these attacks, and the effects of each attack on video quality and robustness are empirically demonstrated. Additionally, the combination of the longest common substring (LCS) technique with the probabilistic model is examined.

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of related schemes, Section 3 details the problem formulation and the models developed, Section 4 introduces and explains the modified algorithm, Section 5 presents experimental results and discussion, and finally, Section 6 concludes the paper.

A discussion on the computation analysis of the longest common substring (LCS) is outlined, emphasizing its calculation using the generalized suffix tree and its relevance to the proposed algorithm's focus on common substring length.

The paper also introduces the function Xbi, defined as the transformed coefficient notation (TCN) value of a Context Adaptive Variable Length Coding (CAVLC) block bi. The watermark embedding process involves the user selecting a subset of blocks to watermark based on a user-defined threshold, with the modification decision depending on both the TCN value and the embedding bit.

At the attacker side, the adversary attempts to predict the user threshold and perform various attacking scenarios to eliminate or corrupt the watermark, leading to increased video distortion. The paper discusses and analyzes these scenarios in terms of watermark robustness, bit rate, and distortion.

Furthermore, the paper presents a proposed algorithm for solving desynchronization problems in digital media, including image, audio, and video. The algorithm focuses on comparing the extracted watermark with the detected, potentially attacked, sequence using the proposed algorithm, emphasizing the detection of the watermarked sequence even when subjected to a high attacking percentage.

In summary, the proposed algorithm addresses desynchronization problems in all types of digital media and is effective in watermark detection even when the watermark bits are altered. The simulation results demonstrate the impact of attacking scenarios on video quality and the potential efficacy of using a specific threshold in watermark embedding to avoid specific attacking scenarios while preserving watermark quality. Additionally, the paper discusses the impact of attacking on watermark synchronization and the use of the probabilistic model to restore the original watermark.
