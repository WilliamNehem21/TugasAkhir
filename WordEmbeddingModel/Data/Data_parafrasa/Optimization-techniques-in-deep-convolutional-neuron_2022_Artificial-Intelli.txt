Plant diseases have a negative impact on both the quality and quantity of agricultural production. However, accurately predicting these diseases can help mitigate the effect on crop quality and reduce the risk of production losses. Current methods for detecting plant diseases, whether through visual inspection or traditional techniques, are time-consuming, may have limited availability, and can produce high-risk errors. This study explores the application of different convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures and optimization algorithms for the detection of olive diseases, aiming to identify the most effective model for disease detection. The dataset used consists of 5571 manually collected olive leaf images from various regions of Morocco, including a healthy class for comparison with diseased plants. The study also investigates the correlation between CNN architectures and optimization algorithms, evaluating their performance using accuracy and other metrics. The results indicate that the MobileNet architecture using the RMSprop algorithm outperformed other combinations in terms of the disease detector's performance and efficiency.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the materials and methods, including background information and related works, as well as the simulation workflow. Sections 3 and 4 cover the experimental setup, simulation results, and discussions. Finally, Section 4 provides conclusions and outlines potential future research directions.

Advancements in neural network engineering since 1989 have led to improved classification and regularization constraints, contributing to continuous enhancements in intelligent systems and their applications.

The symptoms of olive diseases, such as stroke, typically manifest in late winter or early spring, characterized by wilting twigs and branches with distinctive discoloration. Disease patterns of olive trees vary with factors such as season, humidity, temperature, and radiance. Images of diseased plants were collected under various weather conditions to facilitate comprehensive applications, and all diseased images in the dataset were manually annotated by agricultural experts.

Preprocessing of the data involved data point scaling and splitting the images into training and testing sets. Enhancement approaches were applied to improve pixel distribution and contrast stretching. Image annotation was performed to label diseased areas and assign corresponding classes, aided by an algorithm developed in Python. This process produced annotated images in the same size as the originals in jpg or jiff format, with different colors used to uniquely identify plant leaves and differentiate from the background.

Classification tasks involved the use of machine learning algorithms to assign markers to different classes. Data augmentation techniques were utilized to address overfitting issues and improve the performance of the model. The results suggest that in addition to the quality and quantity of images, the types of classes used also impact model performance. The study also highlights that the MobileNet model combined with the RMSprop optimization algorithm offered the best results, as confirmed by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the area under the curve (AUC) values.
