The analysis of cell nuclei shapes is increasingly crucial in the fields of biology and medicine. Recent findings have highlighted the significant impact of variability in the size and shape of nuclei on various biological processes. While current analysis methods in histology and microscopy images are primarily 2D, the emergence of 3D acquisition methods has opened the opportunity for more in-depth 3D shape analysis. In this paper, the authors introduce a framework for analyzing 3D nanoscale reconstructions of brain cell nuclei, focusing on neurons. The framework employs two parametric representations optimized for different shapes, which are then used for statistical analysis and shape comparisons. The study presents the analysis of 121 brain cell nuclei obtained from the somatosensory cortex of a juvenile rat.

The nucleus, a membrane-bound organelle found in eukaryotic cells, plays a significant role in regulating gene expression and cellular activities. Recent research in rat hippocampal neurons has demonstrated that nuclear shape influences nucleocytoplasmic exchange and the regulation of gene expression, particularly for calcium ions. The variability in nuclear shape among species, within species, and even within an individual under different conditions underscores the importance of shape analysis in understanding biological processes and classifying cells.

Current analysis techniques primarily focus on 2D image data, with only a few efforts utilizing 3D reconstructions. However, advancements in 3D acquisition methods are leading to the availability of 3D shape measurements of nuclei, emphasizing the need for shape analysis frameworks to support 3D quantitative measurements, classification, and clustering operations.

The presented framework utilizes parametric representations to analyze 3D reconstructions of cell nuclei, providing a simple but effective method for statistical analysis and shape comparisons. The use of implicit surfaces, specifically hyperquadrics, offers advantages in fitting 2D and 3D data, making it suitable for modeling nuclear shapes observed in electron micrographs.

The study also discusses the challenges of shape analysis at the nanometric resolution, highlighting the need for developing frameworks to account for variability associated with different cell structures and conditions. The authors demonstrate the method on a collection of brain cell nuclear envelopes, obtained from layers vi and ii/iii of the somatosensory cortex of a juvenile rat through semi-automatic segmentation of electron micrographs.

In summary, the paper presents a framework for 3D shape analysis of cell nuclei, highlighting the importance of considering shape variability in biological studies. The authors plan to further explore different surface parameterizations and extend the analysis to other 3D nuclear envelope collections, aiming to classify neurons into subtypes and incorporate domain knowledge for more accurate classification.
