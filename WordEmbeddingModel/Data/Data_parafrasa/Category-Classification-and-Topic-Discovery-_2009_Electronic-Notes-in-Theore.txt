The concept of topic analysis for news involves not only identifying the main theme of a news article, but also classifying it into a specific category for better organization and navigation. Categories in news are high-level groupings such as sports, business, etc., and they help in segmenting newspapers and internet news sites. Whereas, topics are the main themes of news articles and they are created daily as news events unfold.

The paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 provides background information and related work, Section 3 outlines the algorithm for category classification, Section 4 presents the algorithm for topic discovery and classification, Section 5 reports the experimental results, and Section 6 concludes the paper and discusses future work.

Recent research has focused on automatically discovering topics and groups within a document collection. Wang et al introduced a method for discovering groups and topics using a group-topic model to aid social network analysis. The paper also discusses unsupervised topic discovery using document clustering technique.

Assigning an initial set of topics to cover all articles is challenging given the constantly changing nature of news. Hence, in addition to topic classification, there is a need for topic discovery. The topic classification algorithm, like the category classification algorithm, is based on a keyword extraction method. It calculates the similarity between known topics and the given article using keywords, and then assigns the most similar topic to the article. If certain thresholds are met, the article is officially assigned a classified topic; otherwise, a new topic is created, and the article becomes the source of training data.

The algorithm, while simple, fulfills the stringent requirements of topic classification for news articles. Experimental results demonstrate high recall and precision for both Japanese and English, with slight superiority in the Japanese results possibly due to the effectiveness of the keyword extraction algorithm. The results compare favorably with those achieved by other researchers.

Several tests were conducted for topic discovery and classification using different corpora and sparse training data. The proposed method outperformed other classifiers when trained with sparse data, showing its effectiveness in accurately determining the topic of news articles.

The experimental tests included training with sparse data, testing on English corpora (Reuters and a self-compiled corpus from various online news sources), and experimenting with Japanese. The results showed high performance in topic classification, and the proposed method showed better performance compared to standard classification algorithms.

Overall, the findings suggest that the proposed algorithm is effective in discovering and classifying news topics, with promising results across different languages and sparse training data scenarios.
