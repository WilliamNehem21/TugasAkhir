As shown in previous research, the security field has historically been more limited in scope compared to the broader range of approaches available for dependability. Previous literature has predominantly focused on developing security concepts and intuitions based on experiences and principles from the dependability domain, rather than the other way around. However, over the past decade, security has been examined in greater depth, leading to the potential for security theory to make more substantial contributions to dependability than in the past. For instance, widely-used security analysis concepts, such as non-interference, could be reconsidered within the context of dependability by leveraging existing analysis techniques developed for non-interference in the security field.

This paper aims to explore the potential application of the generalized non-deducibility on compositions (referred to as gndc) for analyzing dependable systems, with a specific focus on fault-tolerant systems. While gndc was originally introduced as a framework for uniformly expressing and validating a range of security properties, it has not been previously applied to the field of dependability. This paper intends to demonstrate how the gndc formulation can be utilized to articulate safety properties that are pertinent to dependability analysis, such as fail-stop, fail-safe, and fail-silent properties. This represents a step towards formally classifying dependable properties in a manner similar to what has been achieved in the realm of security. Additionally, this paper aims to show how some of the theoretical findings of gndc, originally developed for security analysis, can be restated and repurposed for the analysis of dependability.

Process algebras can provide a cohesive framework for specifying fault-tolerant systems. For example, a variant of the CCS was employed in prior works to model a system, its failure behavior, recovery strategies, and assumptions about faults. Fault-tolerant properties expressed as logical formulas are then verified on a finite state model of the system through model checking.

In general, a fault-tolerant (candidate) system model is represented as a CCS process `p#` obtained by incorporating processes that realize error-recovery strategies in line with a fault-tolerant design strategy (e.g., component duplicates, triple modular redundancy, voting, etc.). Notably, unlike other approaches, the faulty behavior is described only in the system `p#`, rather than also in the fault injector `ff`. This difference is a technical maneuver to encode fault tolerance analysis as non-interference analysis and, in the end, as part of gndc.

For example, the behavior of a flashing torch using the fault-tolerant energizer is represented. The energizer is expected to supply one unit of energy, even in case of a fault. The flashing torch emits a flash action whenever it receives exactly one unit of energy, and no flash otherwise.

Once characterized as a gndc property, fault tolerance can benefit from various theoretical findings and analysis techniques, which are unique to the research background in security analysis. In particular, when trace or simulation relations are utilized to describe fault-tolerance properties, the gndc theory ensures the existence of efficient analysis procedures. This benefit encompasses both a static characterization (eliminating universal quantification over all possible fault scenarios) and proofs of compositionality. Another advantage of our unified characterization is the ability to compare dependability properties, similar to those done for security properties within the gndc framework. This could potentially pave the way for a formal and unified taxonomy of dependability and security properties.
