Monitoring heating demand is a complex task due to the lack of widely used heat meters and the difficulty in accessing real heat demand data, as indicated by various research studies. Advanced building automation systems are not present in all buildings, and the use of diverse heating technologies and sources further complicates the measurement process. Consequently, district-level data is more accessible for forecasting heating demand compared to national-level data, with a focus on district heating systems due to the availability of high-resolution data at this level. However, not all district-level heating systems have monitoring systems installed, leading some studies to rely on physical modeling to obtain high-resolution data. In many cases, training data is derived from building simulations, particularly for the early design stages of a building. While high-resolution models are commonly used for small areas, such as a campus, there is insufficient data for long-term forecasts for larger areas like cities or countries. Economic data is typically used for large-scale heat demand estimations, such as national demand, but this approach may not be sufficient for long-term forecasts in the context of increasing decarbonization and deepening inter-sectoral energy interactions.

The following sections of the paper are organized as follows: Section 2 describes the model methodology, Section 3 applies the model to Scotland, Section 4 presents the results and discussion, and Section 5 concludes the study.

Sensitivity analysis is employed to assess the significance of different inputs to a model and understand the impact of input changes on the output. This analysis is typically conducted through local and global sensitivity analyses, with the one-way method representing a type of local sensitivity analysis that changes one parameter at a time to observe its effect on the output. While local sensitivity analysis is straightforward, it does not capture input interactions; thus, the method may yield different sensitivity rankings. The Morris method, a global sensitivity analysis approach, is developed based on the local derivative-based sensitivity method and combines the benefits of both local and global sensitivity analyses by approximating derivatives using a finite difference scheme.

Due to the scarcity of actual heating data, particularly in expansive regions like Scotland, obtaining hourly heating data is challenging compared to electricity demand data. The model's evaluation involves comparing annual heating demand obtained from the design builder with official government data and comparing the hourly heating data from the study with data obtained from building simulations to verify the model's reliability.

Improvements to the artificial neural network (ANN) used in the model resulted in enhanced performance, as demonstrated by improvements in both normalized mean bias error (NMBE) and coefficient of variation-root mean square error (CV-RMSE) values. This improvement was achieved by removing inputs with minimal impact on the ANN prediction, leading to a notable shift in NMBE values from -0.4 to approximately -23+ y before the enhancement.
