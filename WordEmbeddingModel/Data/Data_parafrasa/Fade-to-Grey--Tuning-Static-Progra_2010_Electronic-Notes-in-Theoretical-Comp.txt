Static program analysis is a method that can help mitigate some of the drawbacks mentioned earlier. Unlike traditional testing, static program analysis does not execute the code, but rather examines the source code to identify known risky programming constructs, their combinations, causal relationships, and the potential impact of tainted input. Common examples in C/C++ include null pointer dereferences, accessing freed memory, memory leaks, and creating exploits through buffer overruns. These types of bugs are typically only discovered to the extent that they affect functional behavior, and since traditional testing focuses on checking the functional behavior of the system, finding these types of bugs is often a welcome side effect rather than the primary goal. Static program analysis can directly identify these software deficiencies and is scalable to large code bases, making it a complementary approach to traditional testing.

Modern static analysis tools can assist in classifying bugs and providing measures for improvement based on empirical data. However, collecting and processing semantic information may lead to excessive computation and slow down the analysis to the point where it is not scalable to larger programs. In addition, modern static program analyzers may mix over- and under-approximations within the same analysis, resulting in false alarms. To address these challenges, tuning the strictness of different checks, adding more semantic information, and implementing false path elimination strategies can improve the bug/false alarm ratio of static program analyzers.

The severity of a warning can be classified as high, medium, or low, and is typically how developers categorize bugs. Security flaws, even if they have benign causes or only occur under specific circumstances, can be more severe than errors that have an immediate impact on functionality. Additionally, catching bugs depending on their incidence can be tuned by the analysis algorithms used. Must-analysis is effective at identifying bugs that will always occur, while may-analysis identifies potential bugs on single executions.

Reducing false alarms resulting from over- or under-approximations can be addressed by using finer abstractions, specialized analysis algorithms, and refining the syntactic description of properties at an intra-procedural level. Our own tool, Goanna, which is written in OCaml and uses the back-end model checker NuSMV 2.3.1, has been implemented to handle full C/C++, including compiler-dependent switches for the GNU GCC compiler. The run-times for our tool are typically in the order of compilation time.

Through our experiences in tuning static program analysis for large software systems, we achieved an 83% reduction in false alarms and low severity warnings by adjusting the precision of our rules and encoding checks as CTL properties. Our reported defect density for the Firefox code base is around 3.2 warnings per 1000 lines of code, and we advocate for understanding programming styles, bug severity, and the importance of scalability in the analysis process.

We presented our experiences in keeping the warning rate down and advocating for a practical classification of properties and bugs based on real-world code oddities. We emphasize the importance of fine-tuning syntactic checks based on programming styles rather than relying solely on expensive semantic analysis. Finally, we mentioned related work on evaluating and tuning static analysis for null pointer exceptions in Java, as well as research on coding patterns and prominent commercial static analyzers.
