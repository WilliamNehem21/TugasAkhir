Mentalistic approaches such as FIPA ACL define the semantic meaning of communicative acts from an internal perspective by referencing the mental states of agents, particularly through the BDI model (belief, desire, intention). This model is used to define the feasibility preconditions (conditions that must be satisfied for communicative acts to be planned) and the rational effects (the expected results of the communicative act).

To illustrate these ideas, we use the NetBill protocol as an example, as it is a representative protocol for information exchange in multi-agent systems and lends itself well to discussing related issues.

The second part of the paper focuses on the study of agent interaction verification. We adopt Guerin and Pitt's classification of verification methods, distinguishing between static verification and verification by observation. We propose a method to verify agent specifications' compliance with a set of protocols and sketch a potential implementation using constraint handling rules for verification by observation.

The paper's structure involves providing background in Section 2 by introducing the concept of social integrity constraint. In Section 3, we demonstrate how this concept can be used to specify the social semantics of communicative acts and agent interaction protocols. The different kinds of verification are studied in Section 4, with a discussion and directions for future work concluding the paper.

We discuss how a course of events can create social expectations regarding the future behavior of its members, which are captured in a set called "exp" containing expected and unexpected events.

NetBill is further described as a security and transaction protocol for the sale and delivery of low-priced information goods, operating between merchants and customers through a server. A simplified version of the protocol is considered, and social integrity constraints are defined for the actions involving the consumer and merchant agents.

We introduce a prototype implementation utilizing Constraint Handling Rules (CHR) for verifying compliance with social integrity constraints, with plans for future extensions and refinements. We draw inspiration from related work on commitment classes and finite state automata for communicative act semantics.

Our concept of expectations is linked to obligations and permissions, and we plan to extend our work to incorporate a more comprehensive syntax of social integrity constraints and formalize the framework's properties further.

In conclusion, we are working on extending the proof, developing a prototype of the social infrastructure, investigating the issue of sanctions and recovery from violation states, and exploring the formal properties of the proof procedures in the framework. We aim to ensure soundness and completeness with respect to the declarative specification.
