The internet has become an essential source of information that is increasingly integrated into our daily activities. We primarily interact with the web through visual browsers, which are designed for visual interaction. However, web pages often contain distracting elements such as banners, ads, and navigation bars that make it difficult for users to locate the relevant information. Filtering out this irrelevant data is a relatively straightforward process for sighted individuals, who can quickly process visual information and find the information they need.

The paper introduces several techniques to improve web accessibility for visually impaired users. The first technique, called context-directed browsing, focuses on identifying and presenting relevant information to users as they navigate through web pages. This approach leverages the context of links to determine the most relevant information on subsequent pages and present it to the user upfront.

Another technique, known as dynamo, aims to make dynamic web content accessible to blind users by unifying different types of content changes and treating web page updates uniformly. This involves enabling blind users to efficiently access information that has changed as a result of their actions on a web page.

The paper also explores model-directed transactions, which involve using a process model to guide web transactions and present the most relevant concepts to users at each step of the transaction. This approach utilizes a finite state automaton to represent the web pages and concepts, leading to improved accessibility for blind users.

Furthermore, the paper presents the architecture of the system and discusses approaches to bridging the web accessibility divide. It also describes a dialog generator module, content analyzer module, and diff algorithm used to enhance web accessibility.

These techniques have the potential to improve web accessibility for visually impaired users and reduce the digital divide between sighted and blind users. The paper concludes by highlighting the importance of these technological advancements and outlining potential areas for future research and enhancements.
