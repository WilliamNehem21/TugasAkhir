Molecular biological models often face a significant increase in complexity due to the large number of potential interactions among proteins, resulting in a vast array of distinct chemical species. Consequently, explicitly generating the quantitative semantics of these models and computing their properties becomes impractical. Model reduction seeks to address this complexity by offering an alternative approach to observation. In this study, we present two comprehensive frameworks for integrating model reductions: a symmetric product operator for combining model reductions for stochastic semantics, and a method for further abstracting existing reduced differential systems using linear projections. We implement both frameworks to further abstract the reduced quantitative semantics of models expressed in kappa, taking into account symmetries among binding sites in proteins.

Signaling pathways delineate the interactions among proteins involved in cellular communication, and like molecular biological models, they also encounter a surge in the number of chemical species due to combinatorial complexity. Rules-based modeling offers a compact solution for describing these pathways and other molecular biological systems by employing context-free rules, thereby circumventing the need to explicitly list all potential interaction contexts.

We apply our framework to models expressed in kappa, providing the operational semantics of kappa in Section 5, defining symmetric sites in kappa in Section 6, reviewing stochastic and differential semantics, and utilizing symmetric sites to further reduce the dimension of the state space of these semantics.

We also review a generic framework proposed for reducing the stochastic semantics of weighted labeled transition systems, which utilizes backward bisimulations to establish statistical invariants. Employing these invariants, certain states of the transition system are combined through weak lumping, a technique that is sound only when the statistical invariants are satisfied by the initial state distribution. We extend this framework by introducing a commutative operator for combining abstractions, demonstrating that this operator is a pushout and that abstraction composition distributes over it.

Additionally, we introduce a new operator for combining two abstractions, defining a span as two abstractions (a1 and a2) from the same weighted labeled transition system (WLTS). We illustrate that the product of two abstractions from the same WLTS is the abstraction that is more abstract than the two given abstractions and is the least abstract among all abstractions satisfying this property.

Furthermore, we present a core of the kappa language in a process-like notation and describe its operational semantics, omitting internal states, agent creation and deletion, and wild-card bond removals. While these features are useful for model writing, they do not pose significant challenges to our theoretical framework.

Finally, we preselect potential triples using a weaker property, regardless of whether the condition in Definition 6.6 is satisfied, by employing the contact map, which summarizes all bonds that may appear in the right-hand side of a rule in r as a graph, with nodes representing pairs.
