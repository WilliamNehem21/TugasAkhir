The recognition of handwritten script poses a significant challenge due to the diverse handwriting qualities and styles, leading to variations between different writers and within the same writer. Various recognition systems have been proposed to address this challenge, with a focus on achieving higher accuracy. These systems typically involve three main steps: preprocessing, feature extraction and selection, and classification and verification. Handwritten digit recognition is a subtask of the optical character recognition (OCR) problem and finds application in tasks such as reading amounts on checks and identifying zip codes on envelopes.

This paper emphasizes the importance of feature extraction and classification in handwritten script recognition. The quality of features plays a crucial role in the performance of a classifier, and a good set of features should effectively represent the characteristics of a particular class while being resilient to changes within that class. Commonly used features in character recognition include invariant moments, projections, zoning features, Fourier descriptors, and contour direction histograms, and a feature set for classifier input can comprise a combination of such features.

The paper discusses various approaches for handwritten script recognition, including a probabilistic neural network (PNN) approach based on the center of gravity and boundary point vectors for recognizing handwritten Indian numerals. Additionally, a holistic approach using a neuro-fuzzy inference engine to recognize Farsi numeral characters is presented, along with a genetic algorithm-based clustering approach using zoning features. The experimental tests demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches compared to traditional zoning design methods.

The paper is divided into five sections, covering details of feature extraction and selection techniques in section 2, classifiers used for recognition in section 3, experimental results in section 4, and conclusions and perspectives in section 5.

Feature extraction techniques such as tangent histograms of digits and feature selection strategies for dimensionality reduction are discussed in the paper. Feature selection aims to select the most informative features that effectively separate different classes, leading to higher speed and reduced computational cost in the classification process.

The Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, derived from statistical learning theory, is highlighted as a powerful technique widely used in various applications, including handwritten digit recognition. The paper also describes methods for solving multi-class problems using SVMs, such as the one-against-all and one-against-one schemes. The paper advocates for using a single n-class SVM for the recognition of n different digits, thereby solving a single constrained optimization problem.

The paper presents a system for recognizing handwritten Persian numerals, focusing on feature extraction with a novel feature set based on transition information in the vertical and horizontal directions of a digit image combined with the chain code histogram (CCH). The classification system is based on SVM, with the results indicating that feature selection reduces the dimensionality of the feature space without compromising classifier performance, leading to high performance with reduced computational complexity compared to existing systems.
