The primary means of communication for interaction is dialogues that involve speech, gestures, and semantic and pragmatic knowledge. Various studies have focused on developing standardized models for dialogue management in goal-oriented applications using machine learning and deep learning methods. This paper provides an overview of the existing approaches to dialogue manager training, highlighting their advantages and limitations. Additionally, it introduces a new image-based method applied to the Facebook bAbI task 1 dataset in an out-of-vocabulary setting, demonstrating that using dialogue as an image yields good performance and helps expand out-of-vocabulary dialogue tasks for dialogue managers compared to memory networks.

In the context of daily interactions with information and communication technology (ICT), which is increasingly distributed and integrated into the environment (referred to as intelligent space), designing ICT solutions for elderly individuals, who are often skeptical of new technology, can be particularly challenging. To enhance human-computer interaction (HCI) with ICT solutions, directed natural interaction and emotional intelligence are crucial.

One approach to facilitating face-to-face interaction is through the use of avatars, which have the potential to humanize the technology being employed and thereby increase acceptance of the software. Interacting with avatars can offer multiple advantages, such as the provision of gestures to enhance understanding of presented information and the visual enrichment of verbal information, for example by adding a lip-synched animated character to audio speech output, which can enhance the intelligibility and robustness of information transmission. Consequently, maintaining consistency between visual and vocal output is of utmost importance.

Furthermore, text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis plays a role in completing dialogue solutions by converting textual replies generated by a dialogue system to speech. While automatic speech recognition (ASR) and TTS are not directly related to dialogue management, they can be considered complementary modules.

The paper is organized into six sections. The first section introduces the dialogue system, followed by a discussion of embodied interaction. The third section outlines existing rule-based and machine learning-based models in dialogue systems, while a new proposed methodology for dialogue systems is explained in the subsequent section. The fifth section presents preliminary results and their discussions, and the final section concludes the findings of the work.

Several studies and projects have demonstrated that embodied interactions can enhance engagement with ICT systems. For example, Bickmore et al. developed a virtual laboratory to investigate the longitudinal use of a virtual exercise coach, finding that older adult participants who interacted with an agent from their home consistently for up to 120 days experienced positive results.

The first chatbot developed using a rule-based system was Eliza, which relied on pattern matching based on user replies. In rule-based systems, human dialogues are modeled as a set of states, and the dialogue manager selects replies for the conversation from a predefined set of rules. This approach has been applied to various applications, such as restaurant booking and online psychological therapy chatbots. One advantage of rule-based methods is that they afford dialogue managers control over selecting replies for the conversation, ensuring that the user is not upset or offended, thus maintaining system consistency.

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a machine learning method in which an agent learns to maximize its notion of reward in a given environment by learning which actions to take in each state. RL methods have gained popularity in recent years due to the application of new deep learning methods, with deep reinforcement learning algorithms outperforming humans in certain game tasks, such as in Atari games, chess, and Go.

Dialogue modeling can be formalized as a Markov decision process (MDP). However, if the dialogue task is complex and involves natural language, the state and action spaces may be of very high dimension. Traditional RL methods can be limited by the curse of dimensionality, and researchers have investigated various solutions. One such approach is hierarchical reinforcement learning, in which the agent learns to abstract the problem, with different hierarchical levels of policies controlling the choice of low-level policies optimized for simpler tasks.

In an experimental setting on the Facebook bAbI dataset task 1, the Xception vision model was utilized. In this approach, a training set comprising correct and incorrect dialogue history and reply pairs was created, and the textual dialogue was converted into an image and processed as a binary classification problem. During testing, all candidate answers for a given dialogue history were ranked, and the highest ranked answer was selected. This work extends prior efforts in the out-of-vocabulary setting.
