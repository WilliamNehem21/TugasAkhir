The management of documents within an organization involves various activities such as creation, reception, organization, storage, preservation, access, and dissemination. Leveraging technology can greatly enhance document management and unlock the value of the vast amount of information contained in these documents. However, organizations face a challenge in balancing the need to safeguard the confidentiality of personal information while also making information accessible. This becomes particularly important in cases where organizations need to share a significant portion of their information either for the sake of transparency or because the stored documents hold scientific, biomedical, or legal value unrelated to personal information. An effective solution to this challenge is document anonymization, which involves replacing or eliminating personal data without altering the original document's value or usefulness.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces document anonymization, Section 3 discusses various architectural initiatives addressing this issue, Section 4 outlines a proposed solution, Section 5 presents the development of a prototype of the reference architecture and its application on a case study, and finally, Section 6 presents conclusions and potential avenues for future work.

The dissemination of personal data is subject to civil and criminal penalties based on regulatory and legislative frameworks. For instance, in Uruguay, there is a law governing the protection of personal data, distinguishing between public information (e.g., name, surname, ID) and sensitive data, which requires the owner's consent for publication. The definition of public or sensitive data varies based on the domain of interest and the country's regulations. For instance, laws in different countries and domains (e.g., medical records) contain varying provisions regarding data protection and access.

Anonymization is focused on maintaining the confidentiality of personal data while preserving the value and usefulness of the documents. Anonymization can be irreversible or reversible, and it must ensure the preservation of the document's content and semantic coherence. Named entity recognition (NER) is a key component in every proposal, recognizing and labeling entities of interest in the text. This process is crucial for identifying and anonymizing sensitive information.

Various proposals and tools, such as OpenCalais and LingPipe, are available for implementing document anonymization. These tools provide capabilities for identifying and classifying named entities, among other functionalities. Moreover, the paper discusses the challenges and potential solutions related to anonymization in specific domains, such as jurisprudence.

The study also presents a prototype focused on anonymizing jurisprudence documents in the judiciary of Uruguay. The process involved using open-source technologies and implementing a semi-automatic approach, which demonstrated the feasibility and efficiency of the system. However, it also highlighted the need for domain-specific training and customization to optimize the anonymization process for specific document types.
