Very little is currently understood about the structure of the skin in juvenile chameleons, particularly in relation to the sensory function of their integumentary structure. In a study conducted in the summer of 2015, fifteen juvenile chameleons were collected from Abu Rawash, a northern area of Giza, Egypt. The chameleons, belonging to the order Squamata and family Chamaeleonidae, were categorized into three age groups based on the morphological criteria of head, abdomen, and limb lengths. The dorsal abdominal surfaces of the chameleons were found to be covered with abdominal scales of varying sizes, either conical or elliptical in structure, and regularly arranged in rows, with each scale possessing a cylindrical lenticular epidermal sense organ containing heavy sensillia. Histologically, the scales were characterized by wider conical surfaces and intermingled with one another by a hinge region. The epidermal layer of the outer scale surface was composed of a five-layered stratified squamous epithelium, including the stratum germinativum and an intermediate zone of stratum spinosum, with an abundance of intermediate zone cells in the peripheral dermal layer underneath the stratum germinativum layer. The melanosomes possessed long cellular processes with their content of melanin granules located underneath the epidermis. The dermis was composed of an upper collagenous layer and an inner compact layer, with semithin sections revealing the presence of fibroblast cells, collagenous fibrils, nerve axons, melanosomes, and mast cells in the connective tissue core. An increased immunoreaction of cytokeratin was observed in the epidermal layers of the oldest age group, while an increased proliferation of epidermal and dermal cells was detected in the youngest age group. Transmission electron microscopy revealed the formation of dermal sense organs containing neuronal cells of both oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells, with myelinated and unmyelinated nerve axons ensheathed externally by thin collagenous fibers.

The study concluded that the skin of juvenile chameleons is keratinized with both external and internal sensation, and abundant mast cells within the dermis provide characteristic immunity. Furthermore, the dispersion of melanosomes within the epidermis and dermis allows the animal to maintain its color alterations according to the surrounding environment.

Integumentary sense organs serve as mechanosensory receptors in reptilian species such as Amphibolurus barbatus and iguanian lizards. These sense organs function as mechanoreceptors and thermoreceptors, and possibly exhibit sensitivity to humidity. They also serve as complex touch corpuscles on the skin surface of the heads of snakes. Small tactile mechanosensory epidermal sense organs have been reported in 13 fully aquatic and two semi-aquatic species of elapids.

At the ultrastructural level, the epidermis is composed of five layers. Basally, germinativum cells with centrally located nuclei containing dispersed euchromatin and characteristic nucleoli were observed. Fine keratohyalin granules were dispersed among the stratum germinativum cells. The intermediate layer contained abundant keratinocytes with cytoplasm rich in keratinohyalin granules. Electron-dense smooth granules of melanosomes were detected among the keratinocytes in the stratum granulosum layer.

A significant finding in the study was the presence of a single epidermal sense organ per dorsal body scale. Each sense organ took on a lenticular shape and possessed dense sensory hairlet structures with bristles. Similar sense organs were reported in other species, although the emerging sensory hairlet structures were very few.

Additionally, it was observed that the epidermal sense organs had deep connections with integumentary sense organs embedded in the dermal layer. Ultrastructurally, these connections appeared in the form of oval-shaped bundles covered by a thin coat of collagenous fibrils and were composed of two types of neurons including Schwann and oligodendrocyte cells, with detection of myelinated and unmyelinated nerve axons.
