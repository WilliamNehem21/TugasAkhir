Enterprises operate in a competitive environment where possessing knowledge is crucial for survival in the present global market. In this new understanding of competition, knowledge is considered an asset with economic value that offers stability and enhances productivity in dynamic competitive environments. 

This paper introduces an extension to document annotation and retrieval strategies used by onto-dom that consider noun modifiers (e.g., adjectives) while maintaining the document's semantics. The rest of the paper outlines an integration of tools, techniques, and ontology-driven approaches for knowledge retrieval and document semantic annotation. The following sections cover related work, a knowledge management system based on distributed organizational memory, strategies for document annotation and knowledge retrieval, an evaluation of these strategies, and conclusions. 

In the field of semantic web, early efforts such as Shoe System and Ontobroker aimed to enable semantic annotation of web documents. However, manual annotation is costly and often creates a bottleneck in knowledge acquisition. To address this, semi-automatic annotation methods have been proposed, such as the CERNO framework, which uses lightweight analysis techniques for semantic annotation of textual data. Unlike our approach, CERNO does not consider relationships between concepts, thus losing relevant semantics. 

Gschwandtner et al. proposed a semantic annotation system for free medical text using MMTx, which maps concepts from the UMLS Metathesaurus to concepts in the text. This approach is domain-dependent, unlike our architecture. 

The paper presents an organizational memory architecture wherein organizations consist of various functional units, each representing a knowledge domain. This architecture allows for distributed knowledge management based on autonomy and coordination principles, with knowledge storage and retrieval strategies driven by domain ontologies. Ontological concepts form the core of annotation and retrieval strategies, enabling query refinement and reasoning processes. Additionally, ontologies facilitate context representation, allowing for the storage of context into knowledge objects and facilitating reusability. 

In the document annotation strategy, linguistic analysis is applied to each document in the corpus, with tags assigned to elements based on their syntactic nature. Document concepts are selected using specific linguistic patterns and linked to ontological concepts. The strategy also involves the use of WordNet for obtaining synonyms and hyperonyms to improve the accuracy of document descriptors. 

The proposed strategy was evaluated using a tourism enterprise, specifically a knowledge domain related to Africa travel. The evaluation involved processing 50 questions and classifying retrieved documents based on whether they contained an answer to the query. The proposed strategy demonstrated a high relevance in retrieving relevant documents, with a map value of 0.895, ensuring that relevant documents are ranked highly in most cases.
