in this paper we study the decidability of reachability, normalisation, and neededness in n-shallow and n-growing trss. in an n-growing trs, a variable that occurs both on the leftand right-hand side of a rewrite rule must be at depth n on the left-hand side and at depth greater than n on the right-hand side. in an n-shallow trs, a variable that occurs both on the leftand right-hand side of a rewrite rule must be at depth n on both sides.



to explore the boundaries of the decidability of reachability, normalisation, and neededness we introduce in this paper n-growing and n-shallow trss. these trss are generalisations of the growing and shallow trss as introduced respectively by jacquemard and comon. although reachability, normalisation, and(in the orthogonal case) neededness are decidable for growing and shallow trss we show that this does not hold for our generalisations.



prove that neededness is decidable for orthogonal growing trss. as each 1-growing trs is growing, we also have decidability of reachability, normalisation, and(in the orthogonal case) neededness for 1-growing trss. however, as we show next, these results do not generalise to n-growing trss with n> 1.



to the trs from the proof of theorem 4.3 does not change the fact that d is reachable from c if and only if n-pcp has a solution for p. however, by adding the rule, if d is reachable from c, then d becomes the only possible normal form of c. by this fact, and the fact that d is reachable from c if and only if n-pcp has a solution for p, we have that c has a normal form if and only if n-pcp has a solution for p.



prove that neededness is decidable for orthogonal shallow trss. as each 1-shallow trs is shallow, we also have decidability of reachability, normalisation, and(in the orthogonal case) neededness for 1-shallow trss. however, as we show next, these results do not generalise to n-shallow trss with n> 1.
