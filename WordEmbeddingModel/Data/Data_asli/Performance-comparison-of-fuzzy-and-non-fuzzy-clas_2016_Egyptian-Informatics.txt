data analysis contains several techniques and tools for handling the data. classification or clustering is well known method in data analysis. it is a multivariate analysis technique to partition the dataset into groups(classes or clusters) in a dataset such that the most indiscernible objects belong to the same group while the discernible objects in different groups. clustering methods are used as a common technique in many fields such as pattern recognition, machine learning, image segmentation, medical diagnostics and bioinformatics.



another fuzzy iterative algorithm gk(extended fcm) was initially proposed by gustafson and kessel and later improved by babuska et al.. babuska et al. introduced an adaptive distance norm, in order to detect different geometrical shapes of the clusters in one data set when the covariance matrix fi fails to be non-singular by the choice of the matrix ai. the distance metric in this algorithm is given by 143 to 341 are classified as class 2. the algorithms km, fcm and gk are applied to generate two clusters. gk generates two clusters corresponding to class 1 and class 2 containing 67 and 274 samples respectively. 45 samples that belong to class 2 are wrongly assigned to class 1 and 120 samples associated with class 1 are wrongly assigned to class 2. fcm generates two clusters corresponding to class 1 and class 2 containing 53 and 288 samples respectively. 36 samples that belong to class 2 are wrongly grouped into class 1 and 125 samples that belong to class 1 are wrongly grouped into class 2. the method km generates two clusters containing 38 and 303 samples corresponding to class 1 and class 2 respectively.



for the liver data set the algorithm k-means achieved accuracy of about 9.85% for the cluster class 1 and 87.94% for the cluster class 2. in comparison, fcm method achieved accuracy of about 11.97% and 81.91% and gk method achieved accuracy of about 15.49% and 77.38% respectively.



according to the results obtained for the three methods the classification performance of k-means yields its best with 55.43% comparing to the method fcm and gk which yield 52.79% and 51.62% respectively in case of liver disorder data set. the classification performance of k-means yields its best with 70.22% comparing to the method fcm and gk which yield 68.54% and 60.68% respectively in case of wine data set.
