by convention x, y, z, x, y, z, w are distinct variables; x, y, z have level 1, x, y, z have level 2, and w has level 3. note that levels are 1, 2, 3,... but our proofs would work as well for levels being integers, reals, or any totally ordered set.



the proof of termination of(sigma) extends smoothly if we add the rules for to(sigma)(to make a set(sigmanew)). the proof of confluence for the system as a whole also extends smoothly. we see some examples of the use of in a moment.



the lcc is simple, clear, and it has good properties. it seems to hit a technical sweet spot: every extension of it which we have considered, provokes significant non-local changes. often in computer science the trick is to find a useful balance between simplicity and expressivity. perhaps the lcc does that.
