similar notions of type coercion appear in a variety of other contexts, such as the compilation of subtyping, unboxing transformations, hybrid type systems, or contracts. in most of these works, the host type system is comparably inexpressive. we show how type coercions generalise to a higher-order polymorphic type system with singleton and dependent kinds. the latter induce significant complications, and necessitate the definition of higher-order kind coercions on the level of types. fortunately, kind coercions are encodable.



most of the rules defining these judgements are entirely standard. in particular, rules regarding singletons and extensionality are taken almost verbatim from stone& harper. the full type system can be found in the appendix, here we focus on the parts that are particular to our calculus.



dynamic type generation for abstract types can be found in a number of previous works, including our own[26,22,18,28,8]. likewise, notions of higher-order coercion are a recurring scheme, as already mentioned in section 1. however, we are not aware of any previous work that investigates either in the context of a type system such as ours, which includes both translucency and type analysis or features dependent kinds.
