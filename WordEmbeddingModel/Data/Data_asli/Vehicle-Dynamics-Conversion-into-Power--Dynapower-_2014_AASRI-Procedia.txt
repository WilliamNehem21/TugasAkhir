even without wind, the vehicle movement generates forces that will make the blades rotate. the blades are mounted on the rotor coupled with the generator through a shaft in order to produce power. this electrical energy will charge the batteries or supply accessories.



compared to other solutions, this system has two main advantages. first, when the devise is closed, the aerodynamics will not be affected. then, the system can be acted on a downhill because the kinetic energy is more significant than on a flat road.



this part presents a new device to convert suspension motion into power. the contact ground-wheel induces a translation movement,. this dynamics can be converted into electrical energy by adding a simple mechanism. we just need to transform translation movement to rotation one in order to produce power.
