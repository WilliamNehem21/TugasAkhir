2 gy-irradiation, reflecting change in the fluidity of the cellular membrane following irradiation, with the most significant change recorded following 2 gy-irradiation. the ftir data further illustrate an increase in the fluidity cellular membrane following 10 cgy and 2 gy-irradiations as marked by the shift and broadening of the ch2 asymmetric stretching vibration band. however, our findings show that 2 gy-irradiation effects on the cellular membrane were much higher than 10 cgy but they also highlight the considerable effect of radiation dose as low as 10 cgy and its associated risk.



exposure to ionizing radiation has been proven to cause variety of cellular effects. of the most deleterious cellular effects of ionizing radiation comes the cell membrane damage. the fluidity of the cell membrane bilayer plays an important role in its functionality. thus, damage in the cell membrane affects its functionality and the whole cell integrity. investigation of the cellular membrane damage is crucial when studying the cellular effects of ionizing radiation. the delectability of the radiation-induced damages relies essentially on the degree of the damage and the sensitivity of the detection techniques. various physical techniques have been proven to be powerful, sensitive, and non-destructive techniques to investigate the radiation-induced damages at the cellular and molecular levels. two of these techniques were used in this study, dielectric spectroscopy and ftir spectroscopy.



the sample as capacitor upto 100 mhz. on the other hand, the complex electric modulus m*= m'+ im'' is a calculus method used for eliminate the interfacial electrode polarization that might cover any of the main relaxation processes in dielectric loss plots. through the permittivity parameters measurements, the influence of different doses of radiation will be investigated for lung tissues of irradiated rats.



induced membrane fluidity was way higher than that recorded following 10 cgy-irradiation. furthermore, ftir data confirms the remarkable conformational changes in the cell membrane following irradiation with the 2 gy-irradiation having the major effect. the data also emphasize the risk associated with low-dose radiation exposure through its damaging effect at the cellular level.
