epilepsy poses serious disability among afflicted individuals and its treatment involves the use of antiepileptic agents with ability to inhibit neuronal action potential. generation of normal and seizure types action potentials are under the control of voltage-gated sodium channels. these channels are vital in the electrical signaling of cells under the regulation of membrane potential, thus, determine neuronal excitability and serve as molecular target for antiepileptic drugs. blockers of voltage-dependent sodium channels are capable of reducing peak sodium current by decreasing the number of available channels during abnormal neuronal firing. previous researches have shown the upregulation of nav1.6, an isoform of voltagedependent sodium channel, in animal models of epilepsy.



conducted at the university of kwazulu, south africa. data for both proton and carbon-13 nmr were reported as chemical shift in parts per million(ppm). mass spectra were measured on an ap2000(is, 70ev) instrument at the university of virginia, usa.



mice of either sex were divided into twelve groups of six mice per group. group 1 served as control, while groups 2, 3 and 4 received fluphenamic acid(i.p.) at graded doses of 20, 10 and 5 mg/kg. one hour post fluphenamic acid administration these



the design of the test compounds(dcp23, dcp25 and dcp34) was on the basis of suggested pharmacophore model for compounds acting as blockers of the voltage-gated sodium channels[15,16]. infrared spectroscopy(ir) revealed the presence of expected functional groups in the compounds. similarly, nuclear magnetic resonance(nmr) spectra for the three compounds were recorded and the spectral analysis revealed the structures of the products.
