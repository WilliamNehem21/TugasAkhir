we defer the proof of that result to section 18. the point is that we do have a measure extension theorem on a class of spaces that contains both the continuous dcpos of domain theory and the polish spaces of topological measure theory. we will call such spaces lcs-complete, and we are aware that this is probably not an optimal name. topologically complete would have been a better name, if it had not been taken already.



we will also say that x, d is a continuous complete quasi-metric space if and only if b(x, d) is a continuous dcpo. this is again originally a theorem, not a definition[16, theorem 3.7]. the original, more complex definition, is due to mateusz kostanek and pawe-l waszkiewicz.



used by keimel and lawson[24, theorem 6.5], and is due to wilker[35, theorem 3]. theorem 8 of the latter states that every kt4 space, namely every space in which every compact subspace is t4, is wilker. in particular, every hausdorff space is wilker.



a space is completely baire if and only if all its closed subspaces are baire. this is strictly stronger than the baire property. proposition 10.3 and corollary 10.1 together entail the following, which generalizes the fact that every quasi-polish space is completely baire[8, beginning of section 5].
