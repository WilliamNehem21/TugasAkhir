in this paper, we propose a novel(k, n) threshold verifiable secret image sharing scheme(vsiss) which generates encrypted shares. the proposed method can identify cheaters and recover the original secret without any deprivation. moreover the probability of guessing of one correct shared image of the proposed method is minimized.



in this section we propose a verifiable(k, n) secret image sharing scheme based on the 3rd order lfsr-based public key cryptosystem for verification. our proposed verifiable secret image sharing scheme(vsiss) consists of three phases: initialization phase, share generation and reconstruction. section 3.1 presents initialization phase, section 3.2 presents the proposed share generation scheme and section 3.3 introduces the verification and recovery strategy.



this section introduces a scheme to reconstruct the original secret image from k or more shared images. the members of a={a1, a2,..., an} will recover the secret image. if any k number of participants verify each other and gathers their shares, then the original secret will be reconstructed. the steps



extra storage and distortion free recovery: to avoid the truncation distortion and lossless recovery, the schemes[6,7] divide one pixel into two and used extra storage to storage than new pixel. on the other hand, the proposed scheme and the schemes[9,10] can recover the original secret image losslessly without extra storage. though the scheme does not use any extra storage, but recovery is not lossless.
