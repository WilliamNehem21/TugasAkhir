to solve the above issue, our approach is firstly constructing the models in the refinement calculus of object systems(rcos) and then verifying in the real time the safety properties by tool uppaal. tms, along with ehr system, can be integrated into telemedicine systems and provides decision support service for decisions makers such as experts, doctors of different hospitals in different countries. we choose rcos to develop tms because it supports both static structural and dynamic behavioral refinement of object-oriented system and can effectively reduce the complexity of system by separating concerns. rcos is founded on a well-formed semantic model with a refinement calculus[7,15], including a precise notation for object-oriented and component based design, thus the formal techniques, including tools such as uppaal can be applied in the development process to ensure the



this paper is organized as follows. in the next section, we introduce the class model and interaction model in rcos. in section 3, we present our approach to construct tms by rcos. in section 4, we verify the system by uppaal. finally we conclude in section 5.



rcos is developed to support model-driven development methods. it provides with multi-view modeling environment and combines object-oriented and componentbased design and analysis techniques. it effectively reduces the complexity of system and ensures the consistency and correctness of the system. in rcos, a component is an essential concept, which is an implementation of a contract. we



the system sends the patient data to the ehr data center to generate an ehr item. when it is in ehr mode, doctor only needs to select an existed ehr item. then after the generated or selected ehr item is analyzed by system, reminders, evidences and guideline links are provided to the doctor.
