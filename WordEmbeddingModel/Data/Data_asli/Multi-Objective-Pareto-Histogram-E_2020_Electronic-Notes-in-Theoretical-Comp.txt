these algorithms with a posteriori preference are preferred because they treat the objective functions independently, where each one is independently maximized or minimized to obtain a set of compromise solutions called the pareto set. in this context, the decision-maker chooses one or several solutions according to the compromise criterion between the objective functions. mopso-clahe is a method that can be found among these algorithms.



speed-constrained multi-objective pso(smpso) is one of the metaheuristics that allow the particle swarm optimization(pso) algorithm to deal with multiobjective optimization problems. coello et al., define a multi-objective optimization problem as the search of a variables decision vector that satisfies certain constraints and optimizes a vector of objective functions.



to evaluate the results of the pareto set, the hypervolume measurement was used. the hypervolume measures the volume of the dominated portion within the objective space according to a reference. the hypervolume metric possesses the necessary conformity to evaluate the dominance of a pareto front over another.



in this paper a summary of the state-of-the-art of image enhancement algorithms is presented regarding histogram transformation, where we identify that multiobjective pareto optimization is not used much. additionally, a multi-objective pareto algorithm named mophe and its mathematical formulation is presented. mophe was designed and developed to enhance the contrast of an image avoiding its excessive distortion, where a set of resulting solutions with contrast, entropy and similarity in relation of compromise is obtained.
