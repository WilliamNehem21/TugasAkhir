alex simpson has suggested to use an observationally-induced approach towards modelling computational effects in denotational semantics. the principal idea is that a single observation algebra is used for defining the computational type structure. he advocates that besides giving algebraic structure this approach also allows the characterisation of the monadic types concretely. we show that free observationally-induced algebras exist in the category of continuous maps between topological spaces for arbitrary pre-chosen observation algebras. moreover, we use this approach to give a lower and an upper powerdomain construction on general topological spaces, both of which generalise the classical characterisations on continuous dcpos. our lower powerdomain construction is for all topological spaces given by the space of non-empty closed subsets with the lower vietoris topology. dually, our upper powerdomain construction is for a wide class of topological spaces given by the space of proper open filters of its topology with the upper vietoris topology. we also give a counterexample showing that this characterisation does not hold for all topological spaces.



we start by giving the general definition of an observationally-induced free algebra construction following. our definitions are set up in the category top of continuous maps between topological spaces. however, in principle the abstract machinery can be transferred to arbitrary categories.



the class of wilker spaces is indeed quite large. it contains all hausdorff spaces and all locally compact topological spaces. counterexamples seem to have a rather artificial flavour, such as the one presented in section 4.1 below. still, to the best of our knowledge it is not known whether the wilker condition is preserved by the standard constructions of denotational semantics.
