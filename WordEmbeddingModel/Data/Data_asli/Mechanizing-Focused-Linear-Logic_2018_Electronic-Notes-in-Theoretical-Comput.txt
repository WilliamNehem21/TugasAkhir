a. focusing is a proof search discipline proposed by andreoli which constraints proofs by enforcing that rules sharing some structural property, like invertibility, are grouped together. the completeness of focusing states that if a formula has a proof, then it has a focused proof.



induction measures: although more relaxed measures for the height of derivations can be used as induction measures(e.g., the axiom rule can have height n for any n), we decided to follow carefully the induction measures used in the proof of cut-elimination and the completeness of focusing in, e.g., and. hence, our proofs reflect exactly the procedures described in the literature.



all types defined in section sec_lexp are parametrized by the type t. therefore, the type of top, for example, is not lexp, but forall t: type, lexp t. hence, for any type t, the expression top t is of type lexp t(e.g., top nat: lexp nat). clearly, the definition of linear logic formulas must be independent of t. in particular, it should not allow pattern matching on terms of type t. therefore, the type lexp of linear logic formulas is defined over all types t(i.e., it is a dependent type). the same holds for atoms and terms:



the base case corresponds to w= h= 0. the cut-formula is one of the units or an atomic proposition. moreover, since h= 0, both premises are either the initial rule or t. we grouped those cases in the following theorem.
