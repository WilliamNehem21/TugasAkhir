this paper looks at metrics on probability distributions. it stands out by comparing standard distance functions on classical discrete probability distributions and on quantum distributions. the standard distance function that we consider for discrete probability is the total variation distance, which is a special case of the kantorovich distance, see e.g.[6,3,17,2,16]. the distance that we study on quantum distributions is the trace distance. it is, in a sense, also a generalisation of the total variation distance.



these concrete distance calculations are a bit of a curiosity. this paper also contains more systematic results about discrete and quantum distances, in section 3 and 4, where the logical reformulation of these distances in terms of validity|= plays a crucial role. there, metric versions are described of the state-and-effect triangles that emerge in the effectus-theoretic[8,5] description of state and predicate transformer semantics for probability.



thus the bell state is qs2 and the ghz state is qs3. it is easy to define qsn as a function in python, and to obtain a list of its n-marginals of dimension 2. the pattern in the next result emerged via experiments.



the example calculations in the previous section are very concrete applications of the total variation and trace distances. in the remaining sections of this paper we will look at these distances from a more general perspective. this section concentrates on the total variation distance, and the next one on the trace distance.
