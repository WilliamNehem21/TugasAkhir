in order to identify which evolutionary events occurred in the evolution of the considered gene family[24,26]. species trees are phylogenetic trees that are based only on speciation events, thus the evolutionary histories represented by a gene tree and a species tree can be different. the reconciliation of a gene tree and a species tree[7,8,9,18,25,27,31,14,3] compares the two trees, in order to infer the evolutionary events represented in the gene tree.



the paper is organized as follows. in section 2, we give some preliminary definitions and properties of gene trees and species trees, and we formally introduce the two combinatorial problems we are interested in. in section 3, we show that the leafins problem is np-complete, while in section 4 we give an approximation algorithm of factor 2 for minleafins. finally, we conclude the paper with some open problems.



as observed in[10,29], nad nodes are considered to be related to errors in the gene tree. here, we consider two combinatorial problems that aim to modify the gene tree by inserting leaves. first, we consider a decision problem that asks if a gene tree can be made consistent by inserting leaves having labels in a multiset m.



proof. since x is a nad node, it follows that at least one of its children, w.l.o.g. xr is mapped to y= lcag,t(x). it follows that each leaf insertion in g[xr], does not change x to a speciation node. moreover, notice that xl is mapped to a node of the subtree t[y].



after the execution of step 1 and 2, snad is empty, while m may not be empty. let me be such a multiset of labels left after the execution of step 1 and step 2. then, the algorithm removes one occurrence of a leaf labeled by l in me, and inserts a leaf labeled by l as a sibling of a leaf of g that has label l. the node introduced by the leaf insertion is an ad node, and the mapping of other nodes of g is not influenced by this leaf insertion.
