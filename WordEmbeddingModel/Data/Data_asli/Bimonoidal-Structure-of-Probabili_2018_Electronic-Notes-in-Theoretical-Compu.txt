we give a conceptual treatment of the notion of joints, marginals, and independence in the setting of categorical probability. this is achieved by endowing the usual probability monads(like the giry monad) with a monoidal and an opmonoidal structure, mutually compatible(i.e. a bimonoidal structure). if the under-



we explain the theory and the operational interpretation, with the help of the graphical calculus for monoidal categories. we give a definition of stochastic independence based on the bimonoidal structure, compatible with the intuition and with other approaches in the literature for cartesian monoidal categories. we then show as an example that the kantorovich monad on the category of complete metric spaces is a bimonoidal monad for a non-cartesian monoidal structure.



however, not every probability monad in the literature is bimonoidal, not even strong; a famous counterexample is in. while a non-bimonoidal probability monad could be of use in measure theory to talk about spaces of measures, it would be far from applications to probability, since it would not permit talking about concepts like stochastic independence and correlation, which in probability theory play a central role. we thus want to argue that in order for a monad to really count as a probability monad, it should be a bimonoidal monad.



the kantorovich monad is a probability monad on complete metric spaces. it was first defined by van breugel for compact and for complete 1-bounded metric spaces. we will use here the definitions and results of, which work for all complete metric spaces.
