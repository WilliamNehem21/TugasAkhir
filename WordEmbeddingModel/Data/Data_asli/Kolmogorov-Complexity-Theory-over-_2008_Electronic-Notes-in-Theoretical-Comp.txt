as an application,[28, corollary 4] presents an alternative proof to a known lower bound in the algebraic complexity theory of polynomials, thus exemplifying the real incompressibility method as a natural counterpart to fact 1.1d). we will give another application in observation 4.1.



remark 2.2 more precisely, any finite information(like, e.g. the number j of real constants following or the length of the input x to simulate m on) can be incorporated in this way without increasing the size of the encoding. this simplifies several putative pitfalls from classical kolmogorov complexity like[20, example 2.1.4]



now although the latter answer may in general be wrong, the finitely many queries u1,..., un h admit a common m beyond which all are reported correctly; and so are the negative ones vj h anyway. hence for m m, n, g(x, m)= f(x).
