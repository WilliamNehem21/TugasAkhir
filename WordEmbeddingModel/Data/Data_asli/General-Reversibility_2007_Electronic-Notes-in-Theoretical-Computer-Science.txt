the first and the second author introduced reversible ccs(rccs) in order to model concurrent computations where certain actions are allowed to be reversed. here we show that the core of the construction can be analysed at an abstract level, yielding a theorem of pure category theory which underlies the previous results. this opens the way to several new examples; in particular we demonstrate an application to petri nets.



an explanation of how theorem 4.4 relates to the previous work concerning rccs. in particular, a weak bisimulation that relates the lts of transactions to the lts of reversible histories where the reversible actions are treated as internal(cf theorem 5.3).



the conclusion of proposition 2.3 implies that i and r are actually subcategories of c since they contain the identities and are closed under composition. we shall take advantage of this by often confusing i and r with the subcategories they form the arrows of.



it is instructive to consider a more substantial example in order to illustrate the theory. here we shall consider petri nets as sm categories in the tradition of. note, however, that we do not deal with strict symmetric monoidal categories. we shall first need to recall the notion of a tensor scheme and the associated notion of a free sm category on a tensor scheme; indeed, as we shall see, tensor schemes are very closely related to petri nets. note that tensor schemes can also be used in order to construct ordinary(ie non-symmetric) free monoidal categories.



another contribution is the observation that breaking up a computation into irreversible-reversible components naturally leads to a factorisation system on the category of computations. as part of future work, we plan to study such factorisation systems in more detail. we also plan to explore connections with previous work on factorisation systems in rewriting theory.
