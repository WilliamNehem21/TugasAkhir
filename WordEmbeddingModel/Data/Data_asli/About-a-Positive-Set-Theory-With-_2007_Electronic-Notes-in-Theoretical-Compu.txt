in and, the theory is erroneously attributed to e. weydert; rather, the first who proposed the theory seems to be r. hinnion, even though weydert contributed a lot in the area with his thesis. in fact, some theories inspired by the same ideas as strong-frege-3 can be found in the works of hinnion himself, see and, besides those of other researchers such as brady, gilmore and skolem. instead, it seems, and are the only papers dedicated to strong-frege-3 itself.



the previous remarks show that strong-frege-3 is able to provide a variety of set theoretic constructions. however, as we said, the consistency problem for strongfrege-3 is open. what can be done is giving models of fragments of strong-frege-3. in the following subsections we will consider some interesting fragments and models for them.



friedberg in 1958 showed that the class of all r.e. sets has an injective enumeration. here we want to prove the same result for the subclass v01 of all r.e. sets which encode partial recursive functions valued in{0, 1}(with respect to the standard encoding of pairs of integers with integers).
