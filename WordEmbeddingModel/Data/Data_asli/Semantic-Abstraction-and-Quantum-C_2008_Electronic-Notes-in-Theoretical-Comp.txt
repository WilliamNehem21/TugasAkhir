the properties of the moore-penrose pseudo-inverse(cf. e.g.) guarantees a form of optimality of the abstractions constructed via pai; in fact, they are the closest to the concrete semantics one can construct, where closeness is defined via the distance induced by the norm on the hilbert space. as this is a numerical quantity, we can get an estimate of the information lost in the abstraction.



in general, even if there is no ambiguity about which state the system is in, it is left to chance which of several possible observations(together with the associate state reductions) will materialise. the probabilities of certain observations depend on the state observed and its relation to the intended observable o(see e.g.[14, p99] or[18, p88]):



this formal model of quantum measurement, aka projective measurement 5, depends on the possibility of a spectral decomposition of observables, i.e. finitedimensional self-adjoint operators(see e.g.[19, thm 10.21] and for the general, infinite-dimensional case[15, thm 5.2.2]).



we briefly recall the deutsch problem and the quantum circuit for solving it. we consider here the case of a unary boolean function, but the result can straightforwardly be generalised to the case of n-ary boolean functions in the same way as the deutsch algorithm can be generalised to the deutsch-jozsa algorithm(see e.g.).
