as the adaptation of a system to a changing environment gets more and more important, petri nets that can be transformed during runtime have become a significant topic in the recent years. application areas cover e.g. computer supported cooperative work, multi agent systems, dynamic process mining and mobile networks. moreover, this approach increases the expressiveness of petri nets and allows a formal description of dynamic changes.



for the theory of adhesive hlr systems we refer to. in the following, we only analyze which kinds of low-level and high-level petri nets are weak adhesive hlr categories. to apply the whole general theory of adhesive hlr systems to these nets, some more properties are necessary which are not handled here.



the next proofs are very similar to the proofs for p/t systems being a weak adhesive hlr category in. we generalize these proofs to the category of markings. first we shall show that pushouts along mstrict-morphisms exist and preserve mstrict-morphisms.



our goal is to model a small library system, where users may enter the reading hall if they have an access card and do not carry a bag. in the reading hall, they may read books if they have a library card. for leaving the reading hall they have to give back all books.
