first, given a set of thresholds, we develop an approach based on spectral expansion by modeling the evolution of the fluid queue as a semi-markov process(smp) and analyzing its performance. while there are techniques based on matrix-analytic methods and forward-backward decomposition, we show that they are not nearly as fast as the spectral-expansion smp-based approach. using the performance measures obtained from the smp model, we suggest an algorithm for selecting the thresholds so that power consumption is minimized, while satisfying a quality-of-service constraint. we illustrate our results using a numerical example.



in section 3 we describe our model and approach for buffer content analysis given x1,..., xn. we devote section 4 for discussion of the steady-state performance measures. in section 5 we describe an algorithm for obtaining the optimal thresholds. in section 6 we describe our approach through a numerical example. finally, in section 7 we present concluding remarks followed by some directions for future work.



towards the end of this section we will make a case for the need for an extremely fast approach to compute the metrics when we use them in an optimization context. thus, although it may be a matter of seconds for a single run, when one needs to run multiple cases, the other methods could take a possibly large amount of time. before delving into further details, we present another remark.



(i) and(ii) is not difficult. we do not consider them here because they are not applicable in our motivating application of data center servers. the arrival process is completely exogenous and independent in this case. furthermore, since there is no cost for performing dvfs, the optimal policy is typically threshold-type(if there is a switching cost, then one would use a hysteretic policy).
