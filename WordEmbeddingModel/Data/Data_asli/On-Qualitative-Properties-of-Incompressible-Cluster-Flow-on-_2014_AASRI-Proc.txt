proof: if the cluster k2 is approaching common node b. then k1 must go through this node at this period of time, since node a is occupied by k2. obviously, k2 can't go through b and stops, so k1 can't go through a.



the newly developed node model software allows for the creation of a cluster movement simulation in a closed necklace consisting of 2n rings. you can locate clusters, specify length and density of clusters and set the number of rings in the necklace n. adjacent nodes are marked by a vertical line, which is crossing proper contours.



in the article qualitative properties of incompressible cluster flow on the ring network is considered, main properties and simulation results are formulated. propositions and proofs of this results and properties are obtained. newly developed software simulates cluster movement on the ring network and proves this results by simulation.
