during the present decade, substantial research on applying and retargeting timed automata technology has been carried out[1,6,9,10,13]. in particular, the timed automata approach has been successful in dealing with scheduling problems which(as is often the case) can be reformulated in terms of reachability. to address the issue of optimal scheduling, the notion of priced timed automata 1 has been introduced[7,4]. in this extended model, the underlying timed automaton is decorated with prices in locations and on transitions, modeling the different rates by which the accumulated cost increases during the behaviours of the timed automaton.



we take a different approach to optimality of infinite behaviours, by applying the principle of discounting: the contribution of a certain part of the behaviour to the overall cost depends on how far into the future this part takes place. discounting is a well-known principle in economics, and has been used in the context of timed automata e.g. in.



to compute discount-optimal infinite paths in priced timed automata, we reduce the problem to that of computing discount-optimal infinite paths in finite weighted graphs. this problem in turn is a special case of the discounted payoff games discussed in. in this section we present the results from which we rely on; for the reduction see section 5.



there are a number of issues which remain open. our computability proof is based on regions and corner points and does not provide a basis for an efficient implementation. in, the authors show that discount-optimal infinite runs admit a certain fixed-point characterization, which together with the notion of priced zones exploited in should allow for efficient, zone-based algorithms for computing discount-optimal infinite runs.
