first degree entailment(fde) is a system of logic defined by priest that can be set up in many ways, but one of these is as a 4-valued logic whose values are t(true only), f(false only), b(both), and n(neither). negation maps t to f, vice versa, n to itself, and b to itself. conjunction is glb, and disjunction is lub. the set of designated values, d, is{b, t} the four corners of truth and the fde logic seem like a correct match. from now on, we will use the four values 0, 1, 2, 3 that correspond to f, n, b, t respectively; this in order to make notation uniform in terms of previously introduced logics.



the logic that results by modifying fde in this way is obviously a sub-logic of it. it is a proper sub-logic. it is not difficult to check that all the rules of fde are designation-preserving except the rule for disjunction-introduction, which is not, as an obvious counter-model shows. however, replace this with the rules:



a 3-valued logic is any of several many-valued logic systems in which there are three truth values indicating true, false and some indeterminate third value. we could say that this new third valued is neither false nor true(n). the conceptual construction of 3-valued logics and its basic ideas were initially created by jan lukasiewicz and c. i. lewis.
