time instants between the current one and w'. this approach provides the basis for formalizing deduction systems for temporal logics endowed with the until operator. for concreteness, we give here a labeled natural deduction system for a linear-time logic endowed with the new history operator and show that, via a proper translation, such a system is also sound and complete with respect to the linear temporal logic ltl with until.



the framework of labeled deduction has been successfully employed for several non-classical, and in particular modal and temporal, logics, e.g.,[8,23,24], since labeling provides a clean and effective way of dealing with modalities and gives rise to deduction systems with good proof-theoretical properties. the basic idea is that labels allow one to explicitly encode additional information, of a semantic or prooftheoretical nature, that is otherwise implicit in the logic one wants to capture. so, for instance, instead of a formula a, one can consider the labeled formula b: a, which intuitively means that a holds at the time instant denoted by b within the underlying kripke semantics. one can also use labels to specify how time instants are related, e.g., the relational formula brc states that the time instant c is accessible from b.



complete with respect to the semantics of ltl. in section 5, we draw conclusions and illustrate directions of current and future work. due to lack of space, some of the proofs are only sketched here. full proofs are given in.
