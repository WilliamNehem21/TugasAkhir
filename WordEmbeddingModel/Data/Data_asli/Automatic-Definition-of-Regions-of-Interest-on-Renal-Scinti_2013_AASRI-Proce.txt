be traced on an image sum based on renal function. the roi must be larger than the renal contour of one pixel to obtain all the informations existing in the renal region. in our study, we propose to use the points of interest spatial and temporal detection of the initialization of the contour and we also propose to use a multiagent system to accelerate this approach.



semi-automatic approach: the methods using this approach permit drawing the renal roi starting from an initialisation point. in y.aribi et al explained the different modules used in their application with an explanation of the algorithm region_ grow that they have used for semi-automatic tracing of roi. another method has also been developed to generate renal roi and evaluate the renal function in a small population.



the hog3d is a descriptor based on the spatio-temporal aspects; it is based on 3d gradient orientations histograms. the integral image representation is essential for the calculation of gradients. for a standard quantification of the orientation of the spatiotemporal gradients, we can use the regular polyhedra. the shape and movement descriptors are combined together simultaneously. in our work, we apply the hog3d descriptor on the video. for this purpose, the video is divided into nx*ny*nt cells.



this method computes in each point(x, y) the transit time t(x, y) of the front(each point is examined only once). one can show that t evolves according to| t|. f= 1(2), this means that the transit time is inversely related to speed of the front. as information is propagated in one direction, it can be the smallest t, and thus find the propagation of the front. the idea is to move the head in a narrow band, which is advanced by freezing the pixels existing in inserting new pixels in the band.
