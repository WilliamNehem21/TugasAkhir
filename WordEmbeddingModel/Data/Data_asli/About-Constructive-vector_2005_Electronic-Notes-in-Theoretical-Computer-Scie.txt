example, an element of a4 is a record(x1, x2, x3, x4) of four elements of a. in computer science, this can be a good solution, for example a byte is usually implemented as a record(b7, b6, b5, b4, b3, b2, b1, b0) of bits. but, in general, the main drawback of this approach is its lack of genericity.



what has been done is easily understood. the first line introduces the variables a, f, n and, v in the environment and then asks for an induction on the variable v. the second line solves the base case providing the unique inhabitant of a 0. the third line solves the induction step. it builds the image of a vector vcons a n e v, using the image by map f of e and the value ihv built by induction. for that, it applies the constructor vcons a n to f e



a solution always looks nice for its creator, but on that matter the best critics remains the users. an important community of coq users contributes to improve continuously the system. a lot of pertinent questions are published on the forum coq club.
