note that the standard definition of head normal processes must be extended to all the possible prefixes, since other prefixes beside the input and the output are present. the choice of head normal form is motivated by biological considerations, as each channel in the summation represents a different motif/site in the molecule. it is worth noting that differently from here it is not considered a subset of names to describe homodimerization reactions(i.e. reactions between two reactants of the same kind). this point will be explained better when the reduction relation is given. the process t[p] indicates the transaction of name t described by the internal process p. the other possible processes outside the transaction are called external



the rule par considers four different kinds of action. if l= comm(x) and l=(t: start), the hypothesis actt(q)= 0 is added to ensure that no transactions are present in the process q. this condition guarantees that the actions inside the transaction have priority over the external ones and so that some desired properties are satisfied(see section 3). each of the subcases is described as follows.



if l=(t: start) the start of a transaction is described. it is necessary to count the processes congruent to the ones involved in the reaction and the function countt is used at this purpose. the rate associate to the prefix coincides with the one of the whole reaction.
