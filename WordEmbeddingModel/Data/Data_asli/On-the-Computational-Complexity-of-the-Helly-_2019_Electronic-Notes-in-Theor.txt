different convexities on graphs are studied extensively[2,4,5] due to their wide number of applications, including distributed systems, social networks, and marketing strategies. moreover, the helly property on graphs has been studied quite intensively in the past. the problem we address considers the helly property on the p3-convexity of a graph. this paper is the first systematic study of the computaincidents to u1 or u2 in m. otherwise, these edges include all edges incident to u1(resp. u2) in the edge p3-convex hull, which includes all edges incident to endpoints of edges in m that have endpoints in v(g)-vertices and e(g)-vertices(denoted by middle edges) and we have an edge restriction 2 contradiction. moreover, there is no edge incident to u1 or u2, or two middle edges incident to a same v(g)-vertex(resp. e(g)-vertex) in m. otherwise, it includes another edge of u1(resp. u2) in the edge p3-convex hull, and it includes all edges of h in the next iterations. therefore, it also implies an edge restriction 2 contradiction in a middle edge of



related to this truth assignment as centers of stars. each star covers the variable counterpart of the literal and, since it is a truth assignment, all clause vertices are reached by a center of star. these p centers of stars are non-adjacent. thus, m is



vertices in s. such s can be pick as the vertices of the large clique and u. consider a maximum edge p3-helly-independent set mj of h. if we pick more than one edge of the clique to mj, the edge p3-convex hull is e(h) and we have an edge restriction
