we implemented the method in an editor which makes it possible to define and modify the deformation with the mouse in a user-friendly way. the choice of prismatic cells reduces the number of points of the control grid, making the deformation easier to edit and visualize. the experimental results show that the proposed method is simple and effective.



the paper is organized as follows. we will discuss the related works in section 2 and introduce concepts on spline surfaces, c0 and c1 continuity and local control in section 3. in section 4, we present the methodology of this work. experimental results are presented in section 5. in section 6 we conclude the paper with some discussions and future works.



we described an efficient 2.5d space deformation method for 3d models of microorganisms, based on a control grid of prisms and splines of arbitrary degree. the method allows convenient editing of the deformation while preserving the c1 continuity of the surface during deformation. the experimental results demonstrated that is possible to simulate various kinds of deformations that can occur in chosen biological structures.



in future works, we will focus in control mesh editing and deformation techniques to facilitate the acquisition the most common coarse deformations. one idea to extend the method to provide multiscale edition, another is to implement a space deformation method based on curves where each point of the curve represents one group of control points. another direction for future research is the incorporation of volume-preserving constraints and avoidance of self-intersection.
