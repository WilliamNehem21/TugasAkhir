an intuition about analogies is that two analogies could always be concatenated if they do not have any symbol in common. in fact, there are three possible ways of concatenating which meet intuition. however, formally, concatenating is not the only possibility. one could mix up symbols, for instance:": a= bb: bab. we shall reject this possibility.



the previous definition conforms to the usual presentation of formal languages. it aims at the generation of a language. thus, as usual, standard structural induction is used to generate all of the members of a language of analogical strings. starting with the elements of a, all possible analogies with the elements of m as models are applied.



the reciprocal problem of generation is that of recognition. with an analogical system, the grammaticality of a given string, i.e., its membership in a language, is tested against the set of attested strings of that language, after the reduction of that given string, by analogy, using the set of models. for recognition, the strings in the pairs of m are used in the reverse direction they appear in m, and the analogies are solved in the direction reverse to that for generation. this is possible thanks to the inversion of ratios in theorem 2.1.



consistency: fan bn=n 1g(fabg; fab! aabbg). by induction on n. base: ab 2(fabg; fab! aabbg) is true, by definition of a language of analogical strings. induction: suppose that an bn is a member of



proof. let(a; m) be a language of analogical strings. let us call ka the maximum over all j w j with w in a. ka exists, because a is finite. let us call km the maximum over all j v0 j j v j with v! v0 in m. km exists also, because m is also finite.
