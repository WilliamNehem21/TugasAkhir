another research field which is closely related to information systems, and thus related to domain theory, is formal concept analysis(for short, fca). it was pioneered by wille and was built on applied lattice and order theory. the core idea of classical fca is to extract the hierarchy structure of concepts inherent in relational data.



in this paper, we investigate the representation of algebraic domains by means of fca. for this purpose, we propose a new notion of f-approximable concept, which can be viewed as a selection of approximable concepts under the constraint of a consistent set employed on a formal context. we further explore the connection between f-approximable concepts and algebraic domains. it is shown that all fapproximable concepts of a formal context form an algebraic domain, and conversely, every algebraic domain is isomorphic to the set of f-approximable concepts of some special formal context.



an algebraic domain if all compact elements of it form a basis. a complete lattice is called an algebraic lattice if it is also an algebraic domain. this paper mainly discusses algebraic domains. bounded complete algebraic domains are called scott domains.
