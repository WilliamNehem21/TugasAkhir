we also seek to generalize the definition of simulation so that kripke structures over different sets of atomic propositions can be related. this will provide us with a very flexible way of relating kripke structures and will allow us to gather all the previous categories kssimap into a single one. first we need the following definition to translate the properties of a kripke structure to a different set of atomic propositions.



the notion of map in sect. 5.1, though already very general and applicable to many situations, is unsatisfactory in the sense that it restricts us to work only with functions. this drawback can be avoided by a simple extension of the ideas introduced above.



it is worth mentioning that when we work with functions in recsrwth|= we only consider recursive functions, whereas we allow arbitrary r.e. relations in recsrelrwth|=. this seems a natural extension to us, since in general the composition of recursive relations is not recursive.
