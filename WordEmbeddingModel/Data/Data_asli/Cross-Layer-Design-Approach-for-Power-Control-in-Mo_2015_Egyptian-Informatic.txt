a mobile ad hoc network is a collection of wireless nodes that can transfer data without the use of network infrastructure or administration. such networks have many potential applications, including in disaster mitigation, defense, health care, academia and business. in such a network, every node acts both as a host and a router.



a wireless ad hoc network works on the principle of one-hop neighbor node broadcasting, in which a transmission signal from the source node propagates to all neighbor nodes within its communication region. transmission powerrelated problems are a common feature affecting the functioning of wireless ad hoc networks. the inability to maintain a steady transmission power, thus, degrades the transmission range and signal strength, and hence the reliability of wireless ad hoc networks is disputed[3,4].



the cross-layer design deviates from the traditional network design approach in which each layer of the stack would be made to operate independently. a workgroup of the internet engineering task force[1,11] has been studying inter-layer interactions and performances in mobile ad hoc networks. the inter-layer interaction metrics and the benefits of information exchange among the lower layers, network layer and transport layer were also reported.



mahlknecht et al. have introduced a method called energy aware distance vector routing for wireless sensor networks, which would decrease the impact of mobility and link disconnection. this method relies on route failure notification and route reestablishment notification from the intermediate nodes.
