facts are enforced to hold in an alloy model. the remaining meaning of this program is self-explanatory given the definition of t. the query logic l for alloy consists of sentences over typed first-order logic with transitive closure. the satisfaction relation|= is the standard interpretation of such queries over models in 7.



16. for example, scenario asks whether one can generate an implementation of p in which the first object has at least one method and its type has all other classes as subtypes; and where a second object is of a different type; its analysis uses implicit existential quantification of its parameters. the invocation^subtype specifies the transitive closure of subtype.



we prove representation theorems for finite distributive ac semi-lattices and de morgan lattices. we focus on finite distributive structures since they are important in applications such as multiple-valued and viewpoint-based reasoning.(representation theorems for the non-distributive case are the subject of section 5.) the computational contents of these results yield efficient implementations of the algebraic operations of such orders in terms of their prime elements. these results also recognize de morgan lattices as ac lattices with an internal symmetry. readers who focus on model-checking issues may safely skip to section 6 on page 14.
