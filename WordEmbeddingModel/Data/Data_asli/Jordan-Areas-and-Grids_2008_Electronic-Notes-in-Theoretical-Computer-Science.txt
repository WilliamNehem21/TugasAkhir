many of theses definitions apply at the same time to a set s and its closure s, so we will restrict ourselves to compact(i.e. bounded and closed) sets. here a representation using grids of points with a decreasing hausdorff distance to the represented set is of interest.



berg et.al. consider a constructive version of the(plain) jordan curve theorem, which unfortunately is not enough for our considerations: a point x outside of the curve and another point y inside of the curve can be constructed from the curve, and that additionally, for every point z not on the curve, there is a polygonal path not touching the curve that either connects x and z or y and z.



the first two of the following representations are immediate from the definition of jordan domains in[6,12,14]. the third is essentially a restriction of a representation of compact sets using a grid of points from(143ff). some properties of this approach(concerning computational complexity) can be found in own paper. in a comparison of several representation of compact sets can be found.
