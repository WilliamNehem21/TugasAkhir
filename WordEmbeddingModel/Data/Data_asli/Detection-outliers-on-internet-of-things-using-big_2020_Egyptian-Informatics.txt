resilient distributed datasets(rdds) processes a large amount of data by making use of the ram, by allowing its actions and transformations to use the cache memory to reduce the computational cost and to make the computations more faster. cordova and moh have presented a new algorithm called rdd-dbscan to overcome the drawbacks of mapreduce with dbscan and to be processed in parallel and in a distributed way using rdds. cordova and moh used apache spark which considered to be an implementation of rdds to implement rdd-dbscan.



was constructed by adding elevation information to a 2d road network in north jutland, denmark with 434,874 instances and four attributes, while the second experiment has been made by using a synthetic dataset of one million entries, two features, three centers and cluster standard deviation of 0.4, finally the third experiment has been made by using synthetic dataset of one million entries, 25 features, three centers and cluster standard deviation of 0.4.
