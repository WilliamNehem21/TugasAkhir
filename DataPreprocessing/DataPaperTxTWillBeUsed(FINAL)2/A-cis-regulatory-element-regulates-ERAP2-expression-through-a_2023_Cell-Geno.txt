In brief
ERAP2 gene variants are associated with autoimmune disorders and severe infectious diseases, but the function of these variants remains unknown. Venema et al. use genome editing and functional genomics to show that these genetic variants regulate ERAP2 through multiple independent mechanisms, including by transforming a downstream gene promoter into an enhancer for ERAP2.

SUMMARY

Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near the ERAP2 gene are associated with various autoimmune con- ditions, as well as protection against lethal infections. Due to high linkage disequilibrium, numerous trait- associated SNPs are correlated with ERAP2 expression; however, their functional mechanisms remain un- identified. We show by reciprocal allelic replacement that ERAP2 expression is directly controlled by the splice region variant rs2248374. However, disease-associated variants in the downstream LNPEP gene pro- moter are independently associated with ERAP2 expression. Allele-specific conformation capture assays re- vealed long-range chromatin contacts between the gene promoters of LNPEP and ERAP2 and showed that interactions were stronger in patients carrying the alleles that increase susceptibility to autoimmune dis- eases. Replacing the SNPs in the LNPEP promoter by reference sequences lowered ERAP2 expression. These findings show that multiple SNPs act in concert to regulate ERAP2 expression and that disease-asso- ciated variants can convert a gene promoter region into a potent enhancer of a distal gene.


INTRODUCTION

MHC class I molecules (MHC-I) display peptides derived from intracellular proteins allowing CD8+ T cells to detect infection and malignancy.1,2 In the endoplasmic reticulum, aminopepti- dases ERAP1 and ERAP2 shorten peptides that are presented by MHC-I.3–5 Dysfunctional ERAP may alter the repertoires of peptides presented by MHC-I, potentially activating CD8+ T cells and causing adverse immune responses.6–8
In genome-wide association studies (GWASs), polymor- phisms at 5q15 (chromosome 5, q arm, G-band 15) near the ERAP1 and ERAP2 genes have been associated with multiple autoimmune conditions. Among them are ankylosing spondy- litis,9,10 Crohn’s disease (CD),11 juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA),12 birdshot chorioretinopathy (BCR),13,14 psoriasis, and Bechet’s disease.15,16 The single-nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) identified in GWAS as disease risk SNPs in ERAP1 usu- ally correspond to changes in amino acid residues, resulting in proteins with different peptide trimming activities and expression levels.8,17–20
On the other hand, many SNPs near ERAP2 are highly corre- lated with the level of ERAP2 expression (i.e., expression quan- titative trait loci [eQTLs] for ERAP2).21,22 Due to linkage disequi- librium (LD) between these SNPs, there are two common ERAP2 haplotypes; one haplotype encodes enzymatically active ERAP2 protein while the alternative haplotype encodes transcript with an extended exon 10 that contains premature termination co- dons, inhibiting mRNA and protein expression.23 The haplotype that produces full-size ERAP2 increases the risk of autoimmune diseases such as CD, JIA, and BCR, but it also protects against severe respiratory infections like pneumonia,24 as well as histor- ically the Black Death, caused by the bacterium Yersinia

pestis.11–13,25 There is a SNP rs2248374 (allele frequency ~50%) located within a donor splicing site directly after exon 10 that tags these common haplotypes.14,23,26 Consequently, rs2248374 is assumed to be the sole variant responsible for ERAP2 expression. Although this is supported by association studies and minigene-based assays,23,26 strikingly, there have been no studies evaluating ERAP2 expression after changing the allele of this SNP in genomic DNA. This leaves the question of whether the rs2248374 genotype is essential for ERAP2 expression unanswered.
More than a hundred additional ERAP2 eQTLs located in and downstream of the ERAP2 gene, form a large ‘‘extended ERAP2 haplotype.’’13 It is commonly assumed that these ERAP2 eQTLs work solely by tagging (i.e., in LD with rs2248374).23,25,27–30 There is however, evidence that some SNPs in the extended ERAP2 haplotype may influence ERAP2 expression independent of rs2248374.20,31 The use of CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing and functional genomics may be able to unravel the ERAP2 haplo- types and identify causal variants that regulate ERAP2 expres- sion but are obscured by LD with rs2248374 in association studies.
We investigated whether rs2248374 is sufficient for the expression of ERAP2. Polymorphisms influencing ERAP2 expression were identified using allelic replacement by CRISPR-mediated homologous repair and conformation cap- ture assays. We report that rs2248374 was indeed critical for ERAP2 expression but that ERAP2 expression is further influ- enced by additional SNPs that facilitate a local conformation that increases promoter interactions.

RESULTS

ERAP2 expression depends on the genotype of rs2248374
The SNP rs2248374 is located downstream of exon 10 of ERAP2 and its genotype strongly correlates with ERAP2 expression. Predictions by deep neural network-based algorithms SpliceAI and Pangolin indicate that the A>G allelic substitution by rs2248374 inhibits constitutive splicing three base pairs (bp) up- stream at the canonical exon-intron junction (SpliceAI, donor loss D score = 0.51, Pangolin D score = 0.58). Despite wide- spread assumption that this SNP controls ERAP2 expression, functional studies are lacking.23 Therefore, we first aimed to determine whether ERAP2 expression is critically dependent on the genotype of this SNP. Allelic replacement by CRISPR- mediated homologous repair using a donor DNA template was used to specifically mutate rs2248374 G>A by homology directed repair (HDR) (Figure 1A; STAR Methods). Because HDR is inefficient,32 a silent mutation was inserted into the donor template to produce a Taql restriction site, which can be used to screen clones with correctly edited SNPs. As THP-1 cells are ho- mozygous for the G allele of rs2248374 (Figure 1B), we used this cell line for experiments because it can be grown in single-cell- derived clones (see also Table S1). We targeted rs2248374 in THP-1 cells and established a clone that was homozygous for the A allele of rs2248374 (Figure 1B). Sequencing of the junctions confirmed that the integrations were seamless and precisely positioned in-frame.
SNP-array analysis was performed to exclude off-target genomic alterations giving rise to duplications and deletions in the genome of the gene edited cell lines (Figure S1; STAR Methods). We did not observe any of such unfavorable events. This confirmed that our editing strategy did not induce wide- spread genomic changes.33 While THP-1 cells are characterized by genomic alterations, including large regions of copy number neutral loss of heterozygosity of chromosome 5 (including 5q15)34,35 (Figure S1), the results confirmed that single-cell clones from the unedited ‘‘wild-type’’ (WT, rs2248374-GG) THP-1 cells and ‘‘edited’’ THP-1 (rs2248374-AA) were geneti- cally identical at 5q15, which justifies their comparison (Fig- ure 1C). In contrast with WT THP-1, ERAP2 transcript became well detectable in THP-1 cells in which we introduced the A allele of rs2248374 (Figure 1D, see also Table S2). According to west- ern blot analysis, WT THP-1 cells lack ERAP2 protein, while the rs2248374-AA clone expressed full-length ERAP2 (Figure 1E), which was enzymatically functional as determined by a fluoro- genic in vitro activity assay (Figure 1F).
Oppositely, we then examined whether mutation of rs2248374 A>G would abolish ERAP2 expression in cells naturally express- ing ERAP2. The Jurkat T cell line was chosen because these cells are heterozygous for rs2248374 and naturally express ERAP2, and they possess the ability to grow in single-cell clones required to overcome the low efficiency of CRISPR knockin by HDR. To alter the single A allele of rs2248374 in the Jurkat cell line, we used a donor DNA template encoding the G variant (Figure S2A) and established a clone homozygous for the G allele of rs2248374 (Figure S2B). We found no changes between our un- edited population and rs2248374 edited Jurkat cells at 5q15 by whole genome homozygosity mapping (Figure S2C). The A>G substitution at position rs2248374 depressed ERAP2 mRNA expression (Figure S2D, see also Table S3) and abolished ERAP2 protein expression (Figure S2E). These results show that ERAP2 mRNA and protein expression are critically depen- dent on the genotype of rs2248374 at steady-state conditions.

Disease risk SNPs are associated with ERAP2 levels independent of rs2248374
Many additional SNPs at chromosome 5q15 show strong associ- ations with ERAP2 gene expression levels36 (also known as ERAP2 expression quantitative trait loci [eQTLs]). Despite LD be- tween rs2248374 and the other ERAP2 eQTLs, rs2248374 does not appear to be the strongest ERAP2 eQTL in the GTEx database (data for GTEx ‘‘whole blood’’ are shown in Figure 2A, see also Table S4). Following this, we investigated the SNPs near the ERAP2 gene that are associated with several T-cell-mediated autoimmune conditions, such as CD, JIA, and BCR (Tables S5– S7). We found strong evidence for colocalization between GWAS signals at 5q15 for BCR, CD, and JIA and cis-eQTLs for ERAP2 (posterior probability of colocalization >90%) (Figures 2B–2D). This indicates that these SNPs alter the risk for autoim- munity through their effects on ERAP2 gene expression. It is note- worthy, however, that the GWAS hits at 5q15 for CD, BCR, and JIA are in high LD (r2 > 0.9) with each other but not in high LD with rs2248374 (r2 < 0.8) (Figure 2E). Furthermore, the GWAS associa- tion signal at 5q15 for JIA that was obtained under a dominant model (lead variant rs27290; Pdominant = 7.5 3 10—9) did not include

rs2248374 (JIA, Pdominant = 0.65), which indicates that the variants increase susceptibility to JIA by different mechanisms (Figure 2D). In line with this, we previously reported that the lead variant rs7705093 (Figure 2C) is associated with BCR after conditioning on rs2248374.37 These findings reveal that SNPs implicated in these complex human diseases by GWAS may affect ERAP2 expression through mechanisms other than rs2248374.
We therefore sought to determine if ERAP2 eQTLs function independently of rs2248374. In agreement with the role ERAP2 plays in the MHC-I pathway that operates in most cell types, ERAP2 eQTLs are shared across many tissues.36,39 As a proof of principle, we used ERAP2 eQTLs from RNA-sequencing data in whole blood from the GTEx Consortium36 (Figure 2F). To test whether the disease-associated top association signals were independent from rs2248374, we performed conditional testing of the ERAP2 eQTL signal by including the genotype of
rs2248374 as a covariate in the regression model. Conditioning on rs2248374 revealed a complex independent ERAP2 eQTL signal composed of many SNPs extending far downstream into the LNPEP gene. This secondary ERAP2 eQTL signal included the lead variants at 5q15 for CD, BCR, and JIA (Pconditioned < 4.8 3 10—66), consistent with earlier findings20,37 (Figure 2F, see also Table S8). We further strengthened these observations by using summary statistics from SNPs associated with plasma levels of ERAP2 from the INTERVAL study (called protein quantitative trait loci, or pQTLs).38 After conditioning on rs2248374, among the top ERAP2 pQTLs in plasma was rs17486481 (Pconditioned = 1.44 3 10—275, see also Table S9), an intronic variant down- stream of exon 12 that introduces a donor splice site leading to an uncharacterized alternatively spliced ERAP2 transcript (termed ‘‘Haplotype C’’),4 but that is not in LD with any of the GWAS lead variants or with rs2248374 (r2 < 0.1 in EUR), nor

associated with the here-studied autoimmune conditions. Regardless, in agreement with the mRNA data from GTEx, con- ditioning on rs2248374 revealed also strong independent asso- ciation between GWAS lead variants and ERAP2 protein levels (Pconditioned < 8.9 3 10—64) (Figure 2F, see also Table S9). Based on these results, we conclude that GWAS signals at 5q15 are associated with ERAP2 levels independently of rs2248374.

SNPs in a downstream cis-regulatory element modulate
ERAP2 promoter interaction
Computational tools to predict the functional impact of non- coding variants may be highly inaccurate.40 To prioritize likely causal variants by experimentally monitoring their effects on ERAP2, we aimed to resolve the function of SNPs that corre- lated with ERAP2 expression independent from rs2248374. First, we used CRISPR-Cas9 in Jurkat cells to eliminate a 116-kb genomic section containing most eQTLs downstream of ERAP2 (which spans the entire LNPEP gene) (Figure S3A). We used Jurkat cells because these cells carry one chromo- some with the protein-coding haplotype of ERAP2 (Figure S2), so that we could screen for single-cell cultures that showed deletion of the region in the desired chromosome by genotyping
the T allele of the ERAP2 eQTL rs10044354 (LD [r2] with rs7705093 in EUR = 0.98) located inside LNPEP by sanger sequencing. We identified a clone with evidence for deletion at 5q15, and as confirmed by sanger sequencing (Figures S3B and S3C). A significant decrease in LNPEP mRNA levels by qPCR as well as depletion of the targeted region by whole genome zygosity mapping supported that we successfully depleted this region across chromosomes (Figures S3D and S3E). However, the ERAP2 expression by qPCR was not signif- icantly reduced by this approach (Figure S3E, see also Table S10). Close examination of the B allele frequency tracks of the SNP-array data revealed incomplete loss of heterozygos- ity for rs10044354 (and rs4360063, another ERAP2 eQTL in full LD) indicating that we only achieved partial deletion of the re- gion in the desired chromosome (Figure S4). Accordingly, we conclude that although we achieved modest depletion of the alternative alleles of eQTLs downstream of ERAP2, this was not sufficient to detect changes in mRNA levels.
Since allelic replacement would provide a more physiologi- cally relevant approach, we next aimed to specifically alter the SNP alleles and evaluate the impact on ERAP2 expression. The large size of the region containing all the ‘‘independent’’

ERAP2 eQTLs prevents efficient HDR,32,33 so we decided to pri- oritize a regulatory interval with ERAP2 eQTLs. Genetic variation in non-coding enhancer sequences near genes can influence gene expression by interacting with the gene promoter.41 There- fore, we leveraged chromosome conformation capture coupled with sequencing (Hi-C) data42 enriched by chromatin immuno- precipitation for the activating histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac, an epigenetic mark of active chromatin that marks enhancer regions) in primary T cells, B cells, and monocytes (STAR Methods), immune cells that share ERAP2 eQTLs as shown by single-cell sequencing studies.39 We selected ERAP2 eQTLs located in active enhancer regions at 5q15 (i.e., H3K27ac peaks) that significantly interacted with the transcrip- tional start site of ERAP2 for each immune cell type. This re- vealed diverse and cell-specific significant interactions of ERAP2 eQTLs across the extended ERAP2 haplotype in immune cells, indicating many regions harboring eQTLs that were phys- ically in proximity with the transcription start site of ERAP2 (Fig- ure 3A). Note that none of these SNPs showed significant inter- action with the promoters of ERAP1 or LNPEP. Among these, nine common non-coding SNPs concentrated in an ~1.6-kb re- gion downstream of ERAP2 at the 5' end of the gene body of LNPEP exhibited strong interactions with the ERAP2 promoter (Figure 3A), suggesting that these SNPs lie within a potential reg- ulatory element (i.e., enhancer) that is active in multiple cell line- ages. Consistent with these data, examination of ENCODE data of heart, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and spleen revealed enrichment of H3K27ac marks spanning the 1.6-kb locus, sup- porting that these SNPs lie within an enhancer-like DNA sequence that is active across tissues (Figure 3A). This also cor- roborates the finding that these SNPs are ERAP2 eQTLs across tissues, as we showed previously43 (Figure 2F). Data from a recent study31 using targeted massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) support that this region may exhibit differential regula- tory effects (i.e., altered transcriptional regulation), depending largely on the allele of SNP rs2548224 (difference in expression levels of target region; reference versus alternative allele for rs2548224, Padj = 4.9 3 10—3) (Figure 3B). This SNP is also a very strong (rs2248374-independent) ERAP2 eQTL and pQTL (Figure S5, see also Tables S8 and S9). In summary, this selected region downstream of ERAP2 contained SNPs that are associ- ated with ERAP2 expression independently of rs2248374, are physically in proximity with the ERAP2 promoter (i.e., by Hi-C), and may exert allelic-dependent effects (i.e., by MPRA). There- fore, we hypothesized that the risk alleles of these SNPs associ- ated with autoimmunity may increase the interaction with the promoters of ERAP2.
To investigate this, we first asked if specific introduction of the
alternative alleles for these SNPs would affect the transcription of ERAP2. We targeted this region of the ERAP2-encoding chro- mosome in Jurkat cells using CRISPR-Cas9 and two guide RNAs in the presence of a large (~1,500 bp) single-stranded DNA tem-
plate identical to the target region but encoding the alternative al- leles for seven of the nine non-coding SNPs (Table 1). These SNPs were selected because they cluster close together (~900 bp distance from 5' SNP rs2548224 to 3' SNP rs2762) and are in tight LD (r2~1 in EUR) with each other, as well as with the GWAS lead variants at 5q15 from CD, BCR, and JIA (r2 > 0.9) (Figure S6). The introduction of the template DNA for CRISPR knockin by HDR did not induce other genomic changes (Figures 3C and S4). Sanger sequencing revealed targeting this intronic region by CRISPR-mediated HDR successfully altered the allele for SNPs rs2548224 in the regulatory element, but not the other targeted SNPs (Figure 3D, see also Figure S7). The single substitution of rs2548224 indicates that part of the repair template was used in the repair mechanisms, which is consistent with the observation that introduction of the substitu- tion is generally highest at the positions close to the Cas9 cut site.44 Regardless, altering the risk allele G to the reference allele T for rs2548224 resulted in significant decrease in ERAP2 mRNA (unpaired t test, p = 3.0 3 10—4) (Figure 3E and Table S11). In agreement with the known ability of enhancers to regulate multi- ple genes within the same topologically associated domain, altering the alleles of these SNPs also resulted in significant re- ductions in the expression of the LNPEP gene (unpaired t test, p = 0.0018), but not ERAP1 (Figure 3E). Last, to determine if the G allele of rs2548224 was sufficient by itself to induce ERAP2 expression, we tested if altering the protective T allele to the risk G allele of rs2548224 affected ERAP2 expression on a genetic background with otherwise protective alleles for all other ERAP2 eQTLs (Figure S8A). To achieve this, we used our generated THP-1 rs2248374-AA clone (Figure 1) and success- fully substituted the reference T allele to the disease risk allele G for rs2548224 using a 129-bp DNA repair template containing only this SNP (Figure S8B). The introduced risk G allele of rs2448224 did not result in a significant increase in the mRNA levels for ERAP2 or LNPEP compared with clones with the refer- ence T alleles (Figure S8C; Table S12). Overall, these results indi- cate that ERAP2 gene expression can be downregulated by pro- tective alleles of disease-associated SNPs downstream of the ERAP2 gene in Jurkat cells, but not in THP-1 cells.
ERAP2 promoter contact is increased by autoimmune disease risk SNPs
RegulomeDB indicates that the SNP rs2548224 overlapped with 153 epigenetic mark peaks in various cell types (e.g., POL2RA in B cells). Considering its position within LNPEP’s promoter re- gion, it makes it difficult to distinguish between local promoter and enhancer functions. To determine whether alleles of the SNPs in the regulatory element directly influenced contact with the ERAP2 promoter, we used allele-specific 4C-seq in B cell lines generated from blood of three BCR patients carrying both the risk and non-risk allele (i.e., heterozygous for disease risk SNPs). Us- ing nuclear proximity ligation, 4C-seq enables the quantification of

contact frequencies between a genomic region of interest and the remainder of the genome.45 Allele-specific 4C-seq has the advan- tage of measuring chromatin contacts of both alleles simulta- neously and allows comparison of the risk allele versus the protec- tive allele in the same cell population. We found that the downstream regulatory region formed specific contacts with the promoter of ERAP2 (Figure 4A, see also Figure S9). Moreover, in two out of three patients, contact frequencies with the ERAP2 pro- moter were substantially higher for the risk allele than the protec- tive allele, supporting the idea that ERAP2 expression may be a consequence of a direct regulatory interaction between the auto- immune risk SNPs and the gene promoter (Figure 4B, see also Figure S10).

DISCUSSION

In this study, we demonstrated that ERAP2 expression is initi- ated or abolished by the genotype of the common SNP rs2248374. Furthermore, we demonstrated that autoimmune disease risk SNPs identified by GWAS at 5q15 are statistically associated with ERAP2 mRNA and protein expression indepen- dently of rs2248374. We show that autoimmune risk SNPs tag a gene-proximal DNA sequence that influences ERAP2 expres- sion and interacts with the gene’s promoter more strongly if it en- codes the risk alleles. Based on these findings, disease suscep- tibility SNPs at 5q15 likely do not confer disease susceptibility by alternative splicing, but by changing enhancer-promoter interac- tions of ERAP2.
The SNP rs2248374 is located at the 5' end of the intron downstream of exon 10 of ERAP2 within a donor splice region
and strongly correlates with alternative splicing of precursor RNA.23,26 While the A allele of rs2248374 results in constitutive splicing, the G allele is predicted to impair recognition of the motif by the spliceosome (Figure 1A), which is conceptually supported by reporter assays outside the context of the ERAP2 gene.26 Through reciprocal SNP editing in genomic DNA, we here demonstrated that the genotype of rs2248374 determines the production of full-length ERAP2 transcripts and protein.
Exon 10 is extended due to the loss of the splice donor site controlled by rs2248374 and consequently includes premature termination codons (PTCs) embedded in intron 10–11.23,26 Tran- scripts that contain a PTC can in principle produce truncated pro- teins, but if translation terminates more than 50–55 nucleotides up- stream (‘‘50-55-nucleotide rule’’) of an exon-exon junction,46 they are generally degraded through a process called nonsense-medi- ated mRNA decay (NMD). Our data show that ERAP2 dramatically alters protein abundance proportionate to transcript levels, which is consistent with the notion that transcripts encoding the G allele of rs2248374 are subjected to NMD during steady state.20,23 The loss of ERAP2 is relatively unusual, given that changes in ERAP2 isoform usage manifest so dramatically at the proteome level.20,47 However, ERAP2 transcripts can escape NMD under inflamma- tory conditions, such that haplotypes that harbor the G allele of rs2248374 have been shown to produce truncated ERAP2 protein isoforms,29,48 not to be confused with ‘‘short’’ ERAP2 protein iso- forms thatare presumably generated by post-translational autoca- talysis unrelated to rs2248374.49
Most protein-coding genes express one dominant isoform,50 but since both alleles of rs2248374 are maintained at near equal

4C analysis of contacts between the downstream regulatory region across the ERAP2 locus.
4C-seq contact profiles across the ERAP2 locus in B cell lines from three patients with BCR that are heterozygous (e.g., rs2548224-G/T) for the ERAP2 eQTLs located in the downstream regulatory element (the 4C viewpoint is centered on the SNP rs3842058 in the LNPEP promoter as depicted by the dashed line). The Y axis represents the normalized captured sequencing reads. The red lines in each track indicate the regions where the risk alleles show more interactions compared with the reference alleles, while the green lines indicate the regions where the reference alleles (i.e., protective alleles) show more interactions.

frequencies (allele frequency ~50%) in the human population, this leads to high interindividual variability in ERAP2 isoform pro- file.23 ERAP2 may enhance immune fitness through balanced se- lection, especially since recent evidence indicates that the pre- sumed ‘‘null allele’’ (i.e., the G allele of rs2248374) encodes distinct protein isoforms in response to infection.29,51 A recent and unusual natural selection pattern during the Black Death for the haplotypes tagged by rs2248374 supports this,25 as well as other studies of ancient DNA.52,53 Nowadays, these hap- lotypes also provide differential protection against respiratory in- fections,24 but they also modify the risk of modern autoimmune diseases like CD, BCR, and JIA. The SNP rs2248374 was long assumed to be primarily responsible for other disease-associ- ated SNPs near ERAP2. Using conditional association analysis and mechanistic data, we challenged this assumption by showing that autoimmune disease risk SNPs identified by GWAS influence ERAP2 expression independently of rs2248374.
These findings are significant for two main reasons: First, these results demonstrate that chromosome structure plays important roles in the transcriptional control of ERAP2 and thus that its expression is regulated by mechanisms beyond alternative splicing. We focused on a small cis-regulatory
sequence downstream of ERAP2 as a proof of principle. Here, we showed that disease risk SNPs alter physical interactions with the promoter in immortalized lymphoblast cell lines from autoimmune patients and that substitution of the allele of one common SNP (rs2548224) significantly affected the expression levels of ERAP2.
Another significant reason is that these findings have implica- tions for our understanding of diseases in which ERAP2 is impli- cated. We recognize that the considerable LD between SNPs near ERAP2 indicates that the effects of rs2248374 on splicing, as well as other mechanisms for regulation (i.e., chromosomal spatial organization), should often occur together. Because of their implications for the etiology of human diseases, it is still important to differentiate them functionally. Because disease- associated SNPs affect ERAP2 expression independently of rs2248374, ERAP2 may be implicated in autoimmunity not because it is expressed in susceptible individuals but because it is expressed at higher levels.20,37 It corresponds with the notion that pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interferons, up- regulate ERAP2 significantly, while regulatory cytokines, like transforming growth factor b, downregulate it, or that ERAP2 is increased in lesions of autoimmune patients.54,55 Overexpres- sion of ERAP2 may be exploited therapeutically by lowering its

concentration in conjunction with local pharmacological inhibi- tion of the enzymatic activity.56
Curiously, we note that the LD between rs2248374 and rs2548224 is higher in the African superpopulation of the 1000 Genomes compared with the European superpopulation (Fig- ure S10), which is interesting considering the recent natural se- lection for these ERAP2 variants in European populations.52 Re- searchers have estimated that selection for rs2248374 and rs2548224 (proxy variant rs10044354 LD, r2 = 0.99 in EUR) occurred in Europe within the past 2,000 years based on a large study of >2,000 ancient European genomes.52,53 Of interest, the allele frequencies for these variants in contemporary African pop- ulations are very close to that of populations in Europe ~2,000 years ago (Figure S10).4 Also, admixture events between archaic and modern European populations have introgressed variants in the ERAP2 gene that are also predicted to affect expression and may influence ancestry-based structure of genetic variation in ERAP2.57 To resolve evolutionary questions regarding selection for these variants further investigation is required that considers the full haplotypes of ERAP2.4 For example, some amino acid variations in ERAP2 show substantial differences in frequency between European and other populations and are predicted to in- fluence enzymatic function of ERAP2 that may modify the sus- ceptibility to autoimmune diseases.4,58

Limitations of the study
We do like to stress that results from conditional eQTL and pQTL analysis in this study, supported by data from chromo- some conformation capture coupled with sequencing analysis (Figure 4; 42), as well as MPRA data31 suggest that many more SNPs may act in concert to regulate ERAP2 expression. A limitation of our work is that these SNPs have not all been independently examined. Also, there may be a cell-type-spe- cific difference of ERAP2 regulation since promoter-interacting eQTL data also indicate less significant interactions in mono- cytes than lymphocytes (Figure 3A). The observation that the haplotype tagged by rs2548224 (proxy variant rs2927608 in the study,59 LD [r2] = 0.95 in EUR) influences the transcriptional responses to influenza A virus in myeloid cells and not lympho- cytes support potential cell-type-specific differences.59 This is supported by the differences we noted in the rs2548224 allelic substitution between Jurkat (lymphocyte lineage) and THP-1 (myeloid lineage) cells. However, alternatively, it is also possible that the G allele is required in concert with other closely positioned ERAP2 eQTLs that are in full LD to facilitate binding of transcription factors and increase expression levels and that substitution to T is sufficient to disrupt this process, but that the G allele is not sufficient to establish long-range chromatin contacts between the LNPEP promoter region and the ERAP2 promoter by itself. Therefore, additional experi- mental work is needed to interrogate the extended ERAP2 haplotype and follow up on some of the derived associations. Single-cell analysis shows that the many ERAP2 eQTLs are shared between immune cells.39,60 Mapping all the putative functional implications of these SNPs by CRISPR-based knockin experiments in genomic DNA is inefficient and labor- intensive, which makes their application in primary tissue chal- lenging. MPRA provides a high-throughput solution to interro-
gating SNP effects, but lacks genomic context, and can only infer local allelic-dependent effects (i.e., no long-range interac- tions). Due to their dependency on PAM sequences for target- ing regions of interest, CRISPR-Cas9-based enhancer-target- ing systems61 may not be able to dissect functional effects at a single nucleotide (i.e., SNP) resolution. It is possible to discern allelic-dependent effects in the canonical genomic context us- ing allele-specific 4C sequencing, but in case of high LD and closely clustered SNPs (e.g., the ~900-bp region identified in this study) functional or non-functional SNPs cannot be distin- guished within the sequence window of interest. Regardless, by integrating information from all these available technologies, we were able to shortlist an interval suitable for interrogation by CRISPR-based knockin techniques. A major drawback of this multi-step approach is that our study is therefore limited by sample size, and ideally, we should have successfully targeted the regulatory region in a larger number of cell lines. Also, while ERAP2 also shows tissue-shared genetic regulation, there may be important cell-type-specific regulatory mechanisms en- forced by disease risk allele that require study of this mecha- nism in affected tissues and under inflammatory conditions. Finally, we have not functionally dissected all known haplo- types of ERAP2, such as haplotype C (tagged by splice variant rs17486481),4 which was strongly associated with ERAP2 plasma levels after adjusting for rs2248374.
An enhancer-promoter loop increases transcriptional output through complex organization of chromatin, structural media- tors, and transcription factors.62–64 Although we narrowed down the cis-regulatory region to ~900 bp, the identity of the structural or transcriptional regulators that juxtapose this region with the ERAP2 promoter remains elusive. Loop-forming tran- scription factors such as CTCF and protein analogues (e.g., YY1, the Mediator complex) have been shown to contribute to enhancer-promoter interactions.64–67 Given that the here-identi- fied cis-regulatory region is located within the LNPEP promoter, it is challenging to identify the factors responsible for ERAP2 expression, since promoters are highly enriched for a large vari- ety of transcription factor footprints (i.e., high chromatin immuno- precipitation sequencing [ChIP-seq] signals). Further studies are required to dissect how these ERAP2 eQTLs modify enhancer activity and transcription, and how these mechanisms are distin- guished from canonical promoter activity for LNPEP genes.

Conclusions
In conclusion, these results show that clustered genetic associa- tion signals that are associated with diverse autoimmune condi- tions and lethal infections act in concert to control expression of ERAP2 and demonstrate that disease risk variants can convert a gene promoter region into a potent enhancer of a distal gene.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS

The THP1 cell line (ATCC, TIB-202 ECACC Cat# 88081201, RRID:CVCL_0006, monocyte isolated from peripheral blood from an acute monocytic leukemia patient) and Jurkat cell line (ATCC, Clone E6-1,TIB-152; established from the peripheral blood of a 14-year-old, male, acute T cell leukemia patient) were purchased from ATCC. Cell lines were cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Insti- tute 1640 medium (RPMI 1640, Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS, Biowest Riverside) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The authenticity of each cell line was monitored by genome- wide SNP-array analysis (for technical details see High-density SNP-array analysis below). On the SNP array, 41 SNPs from a 97-SNP fingerprints for cancer cell line authentication (COSMIC Cell Line repository, available via https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk) were present. Jurkat and THP-1 cell lines used in this study had genotypes identical to those in the COSMIC Cell Line repository (Table S1).
The cell lines were used for CRISPR/Cas9 editing and clones were confirmed to be free of major off-target editing by genome-wide copy number SNP-array analysis. Figure legends or results sections describe the sample size for each experiment. EBV-immortal- ised lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) were generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 3 birdshot chorioretinop- athy patients (#LCL_112062; white, female, 61 years old; #LCL_112061, white female, 64 years old; #11_12893, white female 59 years old). The integrity of the genomes of the LCLs was assessed with whole genome SNP-array analysis, showing no abnormalities (Figure S9). Patient-derived cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific). This study was approved by the institutional review board of the University Medical Center Utrecht, The Netherlands.

METHOD DETAILS

CRISPR-Cas9-mediated allelic substitution
We used the Alt-R gRNA system (Alt-R CRISPR-Cas9 tracrRNA ligated to custom Alt-R CRISPR-Cas9 crRNA) together with recom- binant Alt-R S.p. Cas9 Nuclease V3 (Integrated DNA Technologies) and custom Ultramer DNA Oligo (Integrated DNA Technologies) as donor templates to modify rs2248374 through homology directed repair (Table S13). The guide RNA with the recombinant Cas9 nuclease (RNP complex) was assembled by incubating the Alt-R tracrRNA with the custom crRNA (Tables 13–S15) at 95◦C for 5 min (1:1 ratio), followed by cooling down at room temperature. The RNP complex was mixed with the Alt-R S.p. Cas9 Nuclease and Buffer R (Neon system), followed by 10 min incubation. The custom DNA template was added to the mixture after RNP assembly. THP-1 cells or Jurkat cells were electroporated with the Neon Transfection System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) (for Jurkat cells: protocol A in Table S16). After electroporation the cells were incubated overnight with antibiotic-free culture medium with 20 mM Alt-R HDR Enhancer (Integrated DNA Technologies). The next day, cells were diluted in 10x dilution steps until a final concentration of 30 cells/mL was reached (total volume 10 mL). Cells were seeded in multiple flat-bottom 96-well plates at 20 mL cell suspension per well (<1 cell/well) and transferred to 24 well plates once grown confluently. Confluent cultured clones were lysed (~80% of total vol- ume) in RLT buffer (Qiagen, Cat# 1030963) and DNA was isolated using Qiagen AllPrep DNA/RNA/miRNA Universal Kit (Cat# 80224). The flanking sequence of rs2248374 was amplified by PCR (Forward primer: AGGGAAAGAGAAGAATTGGA; Reverse primer: TCTCTTTCCTGTAGTGATTC) and PCR products incubated with the TaqI-v2 (R0149S, New England Biolabs) restriction enzyme (15 min at 65◦C). Next, the PCR products were loaded on a 1% agarose gel (agarose, Acros Organics; 10x TAE UltraPure, Invitrogen) to assess restriction by TaqI. Samples with a cleaved PCR product were prepared for sanger sequencing to validate in-frame inte- gration of donor DNA and correct modification of rs2248374. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated haplotype substitution (i.e., disease risk alleles to protective alleles) was achieved by using a large single-strand DNA template74 (Table S14, 1500 bp Megamer, Integrated DNA Technologies) with the alternative allele for SNPs (from ‘5 to 3’) rs2548224, rs3842058, rs2548225, rs2617435, rs1046395, rs1046396, and rs2762 and two guide RNAs (assembled separately) targeting upstream of rs2548224 and downstream of rs2762 respectively (Table 1) to introduce two double-strand breaks. The two RNP complexes were transfected together with the Megamer in Jurkat cells (Table S16, Jurkat protocol B). Jurkat cells were incubated overnight with antibiotic-free culture medium with 20 mM Alt-R HDR Enhancer (Integrated DNA Technologies), followed by single-cell seeding. PCR (Forward primer: GTGGGCA GTGGGAAAGTTGG; Reverse primer: TGTCTCCAGCATCAACTCTGA) and restriction analysis by TaqI (TaqI-v2, cleaves PCR prod- ucts containing the G allele of rs1046396 tagging the protective allele) was used to identify clones without cleaved PCR bands (i.e., loss of risk haplotype), and allelic substitutions were validated by sanger sequencing.68

Allelic substitution experiments in THP-1 rs2248374-AA
Allelic substitution of rs2548224 in THP-1 [rs2248374-AA] cells was conducted as described above, but with minor adaptations such as the use of custom Alt-R HDR Donor Oligo (Enhanced Ultramer DNA oligo, Table S15) (Integrated DNA Technologies). Allelic

substitution by CRISPR-Cas9 mediated HDR in THP-1 was done by using 2.0 3 105 cells for the electroporation with Cas9/guideRNA ribonucleoprotein. After DNA isolation of single-cell clones using the AllPrep DNA/RNA/miRNA Universal Kit (Qiagen), we used the TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay for rs2548224 (ThermoFisher Scientific, Catalog number: 4351379) to screen for clones with allelic substitution for rs2458224. Clones that seemed to have successfully underwent allelic substitution (or ‘positive’ clones) were used for PCR (along with 3 negative clones as controls) (Forward primer: AGGAGCGTTAAGTTGTGGCA, Reverse primer: ACACTCAAC ACCGCAAAACG) and subsequent agarose gel electrophoresis and sanger sequencing for validation of the TaqMan assay results was done. After confirming the TaqMan Assay results by sanger sequencing, selected clones were counted and seeded at the same density (2.0 3 105 cells/ml, in a total volume of 20 mL in a T75 flask). After culturing the cells for three days, cells were harvested and lysed in RLT Buffer Plus (Qiagen, Inc. 1053393) and lysates stored at the —80 freezer until RNA isolation. RNA isolation was per- formed using the AllPrep DNA/RNA/miRNA Universal Kit (Qiagen). Subsequently, the isolated RNA was reverse transcribed to pro- duce cDNA using Invitrogen SuperScript IV Reverse Transcriptase (Fisher Scientific, Catalog number: 15317696) and qPCR analysis was performed to quantify gene expression of ERAP1, ERAP2, and LNPEP.

CRISPR-Cas9 knock-out of ERAP2 eQTLs
To delete a 116 kb region downstream of ERAP2 in Jurkat cells, two RNP complexes were assembled in parallel using Alt-R gRNA system (Alt-R CRISPR-Cas9 tracrRNA ligated to custom Alt-R CRISPR-Cas9 crRNA) together with recombinant Alt-R S.p. Cas9 Nuclease V3 (Integrated DNA Technologies). RNPs with guide RNAs (guide RNA1; GGCATTCCTTAAGGGTATCA and guide RNA2; GCGTTGCTTCACATATAAGT, see for details Figure S3) were transfected by electroporation into Jurkat cells (Jurkat protocol B in Table S16). Following transfection, Jurkat cells were diluted to 16.67 cells/mL and seeded in 96 well flat bottom plates (<1 cell/ well at 50 mL cell suspension/well) for single cell cultures. Jurkat clones were screened by PCR (Fw: GTCCTTTCGCTGCTGATTTG; Rv: AGGTCATTCCACCACTTCATTGT), The PCR products were loaded on a 1% agarose gel (agarose, Acros Organics; 10x TAE UltraPure, Invitrogen) with the anticipated PCR product size only detectable after deletion of the entire DNA region, which was verified by sanger sequencing, as well as SNP-array copy number profiling (see section High-density SNP-array analysis (Figures S3 and S4).

Western Blot analysis
Western blotting was used to determine the protein levels of ERAP2. NP40 lysis buffer was used to prepare total cell lysates (1% NP40, 135 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH = 7.4), complemented with cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Pro- tein lysates (20 mg/lane) were separated on a 4–20% Mini-PROTEAN TGX gel (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and transferred to a polyviny- lidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P PVDF, Millipore). After blocking in 5% non-fat dry milk in TBST, membranes were probed overnight at 4◦C with antibodies that recognize ERAP2 (AF3830, R&D Systems) or a-tubulin (T9026, Sigma-Aldrich). Following washing, membranes were incubated with either anti-goat or anti-mouse secondary antibodies conjugated to HRP (DAKO). Protein bands were detected with Amersham ECL Prime Western Blotting (RPN2236, GE Healthcare) on the ChemiDoc Gel Imaging System (Bio-Rad Laboratories).

qPCR analysis
Gene expression was quantified by using qPCR. For ERAP2 we used primers (Table S17) which bind to exon 10 (Fw: CATTCGGATCCCAAGATGAC) and exon 11 (Rv: GGAGTGAACACCCGTCTTGT) to determine functional ERAP2 transcript based on rs2248374 variant. Primers targeting the control gene RPL32 were used to calculate relative expression. (Fw: AGGGTTCGTAGAAGATTCAAGG; Rv: GGAAACATTGTGAGCGATCTC). The nucleotide sequence for the primers used for qPCR of ERAP1 and LNPEP are shown in Table S17.

ERAP2 activity assay
To assess ERAP2 enzymatic function in THP-1 cells after introduction of the A allele of rs2248374, total cellular ERAP2 protein was enriched by immunoprecipitation and incubated with L-Arginine-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin hydrochloride (R-AMC, A2027, Sigma- Aldrich). Briefly, THP-1 cells were lysed (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.5) and 500 mg cell lysate was incubated for 2h at 4◦C with Protein-G-sepharose beads (BV-6511, BioVision) and anti-ERAP2 (AF3830, R&D Systems). Beads were washed in assay buffer (50 mM Tris, 1 mM DTT, pH 7.5) and resuspended in 100 mL assay buffer. Duplicate samples containing 40 mL beads solution were incubated with 40 mM of R-AMC (total volume 50 mL) for 1h at 37◦C, while the fluorescent signal was measured (Ex: 370-10, Em: 440-20) with a CLARIOstar plate reader (BMG Labtech).

Allele-specific 4C-seq
4C template preparation was performed as described.45 Birdshot uveitis patient derived LCLs were cultured in RPMI 1640 supple- mented with 10% FBS 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific), washed and cross-linked in 2% formaldehyde. DNA was digested in situ with MboI (NEB) and Csp6I (Thermo Scientific). Primers used for inverse PCR (5'-TACACGACGCTCTTCC GATCTTGTGGTTGGTTACTTCAGGT-3', 5'-ACTGGAGTTCAGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCTGGACCCTTGACATTAACAAG-3') allow
reading of the ERAP2 eQTL rs3842058 (indel within the regulatory element which is located near rs2548224) in the viewpoint fragment that is associated with the risk allele. Products were sequenced using Illumina sequencing (Illumina NextSeq 500). 4C-seq reads were demultiplexed by matching the 5'-ends of the R1 reads to the reading primer sequence (allowing 2 mismatches) and split into risk and

non-risk reads based on the presence of the indel and its flanking sequence (GGACCCTTGACATTAACAAGTCTGAC for the risk allele and GGACCCTTGACATTAACAAGTCTTTG for the non-risk allele). Finally reads were mapped to the hg19 reference genome and processed using pipe4C45 (github.com/deLaatLab/pipe4C) with the following parameters: normalization to 1 million reads in cis, win- dow size 21, removal of top 2 read counts. Overlay plots were generated using R.

High-density SNP-array analysis
Genomic DNA of unedited and edited clones of THP-1 and Jurkat cell lines, and patient-derived LCLs was used for SNP-array copy number profiling and analysis of regions of homozygosity with the Infinium Human CytoSNP-850K v1.2 BeadChip (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). This array has ~850,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) markers across the genome and can detect genomic insertions and deletions as well as stretches of homozygosity. Data analysis was conducted using NxClinical software v6.0 (Bionano genomics, San Diego, CA, USA). Human genome build Feb. 2009 GRCh37/hg19 was used. Results were classified with BENCH Lab CNV software (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The genotype data were used for cell line verification and monitoring for potential genomic alterations in single cell cultures.

QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

ERAP2 eQTL colocalization and conditional analysis
Summary statistics of GWAS (see also Data Availability) from CD,11 JIA,12 and BCR13 were used in visualisation of disease associated SNPs at 5q15. Significant single tissue eQTLs for ERAP2 (ENSG00000164308.16) in ‘whole blood’ were downloaded from the GTEx (v8) portal36 and used for GWAS colocalization analysis with the coloc R package (STAR Methods).69 We assessed the likelihood of colocalization using the posterior probability for hypothesis 4 ([PP4 = ] that there is an association between both traits, and they are driven by the same causal variant(s)). The likelihood of colocalization was deemed high for associations with PP4 > 0.8. The summary statistics from the BCR GWAS was filtered for variants at (Hg19) chromosome 5 (chr5) from position 96000000–97200000 (n = 6307, Table S5). For colocalization analysis, we cross referenced these BCR variants with GTEx ERAP2 eQTLs to obtain a final set of 679 SNPs. The CD GWAS summary statistics11 (STAR Methods) were filtered for variants at (Hg18) chr5 from position 96081460– 96461460 (n = 197, Table S6) of which 195 overlapped with GTEx ERAP2 eQTLs for colocalization analyses. Because rs2248374 was not in the summary statistics of CD, we used the association statistics for variant rs2549782 (LD (r2) = 1.0 in EUR of 1000 Ge- nomes) for this variant. We filtered the GWAS summary statistics of JIA as reported by Hinks et al.12 for variants at (Hg18) chr5 from position 95159342–98830661 (n = 974, Table S7) of which 495 variants were in common with the GTEx ERAP2 eQTL data from whole blood and used in colocalization analysis. Note that the GWAS summary statistics reported by Hinks et al.12 were calculated under a dominant genetic model. To identify ERAP2 eQTLs and pQTLs with association signals independent from rs2248374, we used approximate conditional analysis by GCTA-COJO70 using GCTA v1.94.1 and the ‘–cojo-cond’ function (STAR Methods). For analysis of ERAP2 eQTLs (Table S8), we used linkage disequilibrium (LD) information from the EUR superpopulation of the 1000 Genomes Project72. The genotype data for the EUR superpopulation was extracted using the ensemble data slicer75 (STAR Methods). Sample IDs from the EUR superpopulation of the 1000 Genomes were obtained by filtering using meta-data from the 1000 Genomes ftp sever (STAR Methods) and converted into a.vcf files using the vcfR R package and formatted in Plink 1.0976 by the ‘‘–recode’’ option into a BED file. We calculated the allele frequency of each SNP using the –freq function in Plink and LD with rs2927608 (i.e., primary GTEx ERAP2 eQTL in whole blood) using the ‘‘–r2’’ option. The summary statistics for ERAP2 pQTL data from blood plasma of the INTERVAL study as reported by Sun et al.38 was used for conditional analysis of ERAP2 pQTLs (Table S9, and STAR Methods).

Splice prediction of rs2248374
We used the deep neural network SpliceA72 and Pangolin77 to predict the effects of the A>G allele substitution in pre-mRNA transcript sequences. Masked scores were predicted via https://spliceailookup.broadinstitute.org/ using "chr5 96900192 A G" as input for hg38, and "chr5 96235896 G A" for hg19.

ERAP2 promotor-interacting SNP selection
The promoter-interacting eQTL summary statistics for ERAP2 determined by H3K27ac HiChIP assays in primary immune cells were obtained from Chandra et al.42 We selected ERAP2 eQTLs located in active enhancer regions at 5q15 (i.e., H3K27ac peaks) that significantly interacted with the transcriptional start site of ERAP2 for each immune cell type (p < 0.05). We visualised H3K27 acet- ylation data from primary tissue analysis from ENCODE using the WASHU Epigenome Browser71 (v54.00) at http:// epigenomegateway.wustl.edu/browser/(direct link to used data at 5q15 via: https://tiny.one/2p92f7tb). Massive parallel sequence data results for ERAP2 eQTLs were obtained from supplementary data from Abell et al.31
