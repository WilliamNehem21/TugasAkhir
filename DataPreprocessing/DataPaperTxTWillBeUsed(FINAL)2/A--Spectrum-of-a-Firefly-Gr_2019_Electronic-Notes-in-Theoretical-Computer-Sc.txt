Abstract
Let G be a connected graph of order n, A(G) is the adjacency matrix of G and D(G) is the diagonal matrix of the row-sums of A(G). In 2017, Nikiforov [8] defined the convex linear combinations Aα(G) of A(G) and D(G) by
Aα(G)= αD(G)+ (1 − α)A(G),  0 ≤ α ≤ 1.
In this paper, we obtain a partial factorization of the Aα-characteristic polynomial of the firefly graph which explicitly gives some eigenvalues of the graph.
Keywords:  Eigenvalues, Aα matrix, firefly Graphs

1	Introduction
Let G be a simple graph of order n with vertex set V (G) and edge set E(G), such that |E(G)| = m. We denote the complete graph with n vertices by Kn. The set of neighbours of a vertex v in G is denoted by NG(v) and NG[v] = NG(v) ∪ {v}. The degree of a vertex v of G, d(v), is defined by |NG(v)|. Two distinct vertices u and v are called true twins in G if NG[u] = NG[v] and are called false twins if NG(u)= NG(v) and u is not adjacent to v, see [7]. The signless Laplacian matrix of G is defined by Q(G) = A(G)+ D(G), where D(G) is the diagonal matrix of the degrees and A(G) = [aij] is the adjacency matrix of G, where aij = 1 if vi is adjacent to vj and aij = 0 otherwise. Recently Nikiforov [8] defined for any real α ∈ [0, 1], the convex linear combinations Aα(G) of A(G) and D(G) by

Aα(G)= αD(G)+ (1 − α)A(G).


It is easy to see that A(G)= A0(G), D(G)= A1(G) and Q(G)= 2A 1 (G). The Aα-

2
characteristic polynomial of G is defined by PAα(G)(x) = det(xI − Aα(G)) and its
roots are called the eigenvalues of Aα(G). As usual, we shall index the eigenvalues of Aα(G) in non-increasing order and denote them as λ1(Aα(G)) ≥ λ2(Aα(G)) ≥
··· ≥ λn(Aα(G)). The spectrum of Aα(G) is defined as the multiset of eigenvalues with their algebraic multiplicity and denoted by Spec(Aα(G)). To simplify we use the Aα and λi(Aα) notation when there is no risk of ambiguity.
As defined by Aouchiche et al. [1], a ﬁrefly graph Fs,r,t is a graph on n = 2r + s + 2t + 1 vertices that consists of s pendant edges, r triangles, and t pendant paths of length 2, all of them sharing a common vertex. Let Fn be the set of all firefly graphs with n vertices. Note that Fn contains the star Sn  Fs,0,0, the stretched stars ( Fs,0,t), the friendship graphs ( F0,r,0) and the butterfly graphs ( Fs,r,0). The relevance of studying this family relates to the fact that many extremal graphs for functions depending on the eigenvalues of graph matrices belong to Fn. For unicyclic graphs, Hong [4] determined the unique graph, Fn−3,1,0, with maximum largest eigenvalue of A(G). Fan et al. [2] determined the unique graph, Fn−3,1,0, with minimum least eigenvalue of A(G) among all unicyclic graphs of order n when n ≥ 12. Petrovi´c et al. [9] determined the unique graph, Fn−3,1,0, with minimum least eigenvalue of A(G) among the cacti with n vertices (n ≥ 12) and k cycles, where 0 ≤ k ≤ [  ♩. Moreover, Li et al [6] characterized graphs, Fn−[ n−1 ♩−1,[ n−1 ♩,0, with the largest signless Laplacian spectral radius among all the
cacti with n vertices.
Here, we address the problem of finding all the eigenvalues of Aα(Fs,r,t), which fills a literature gap and generalizes the eigenvalues of the adjacency and signless Laplacian matrix of a firefly graph for a convenient α.
The paper is organized such that preliminary results are presented in the next section and the main proofs are in Section 3.

First, we present the equitable partition theorem of a matrix which can be found at Horn and Johnson [5] and the Propositions 2.2 and 2.3 that show the eigenvalues of Aα(Kn), Aα(Sn) and upper bounds for λ1(Aα), respectively.
Proposition 2.1 ( [5]) Let M be a matrix of order n deﬁned by
⎡ M1,1 M1,2 ··· M1,k ⎤

. .
⎢	.	.	.	.	⎥
⎣ Mk,1 Mk,2 ··· Mk,k ⎦

where Mi,j, 1 ≤ i, j ≤ k, is a submatrix of order ni × nj such that the sum of each of its rows is equal to ci,j. If M = [ci,j]k×k, then the eigenvalues of M are also eigenvalues of M.

Proposition 2.2 ( [8]) For α ∈ [0, 1], we have
Spec(Aα(Kn)) = {n − 1, (αn − 1)[n−1]};
Spec(Aα(Sn))	=	 1 (αn + β) , α[n−2], 1 (αn − β)},	where	β	=

α2n2 + 4(n − 1)(1 − 2α).
Proposition 2.3 ( [8]) If G is a graph of order n and has m edges, then

Equality holds in the second inequality if and only if G is regular. If α > 0, equality holds in the ﬁrst inequality if and only if G is regular.

Proposition 2.4 states that the existence of twin vertices in G implies the presence of certain eigenvalues, λ, in the spectrum of Aα(G) and also provides a lower bound for the multiplicity, m(λ), of such eigenvalues.
Proposition 2.4 Let G be a graph on n ≥ 2 vertices, with vi and vjp, 1 ≤ p ≤ r, twin vertices in G.
If vi /∼ vjp then αd(vi) ∈ Spec(Aα(G)) and m(αd(vi)) ≥ r.
If vi ∼ vjp then α(d(vi)+ 1) − 1 ∈ Spec(Aα(G)) and m(α(d(vi)+ 1) − 1) ≥ r .
Proof. For a given p ∈ {1, 2,..., r}, let vi and vjp be twin vertices in G. Consider the vector x(p) ∈ Rn with entries

⎧⎪ 1,	if k = i; [x(p)]k =	−1, if k = jp;
⎪⎪⎩ 0,	otherwise.
Since Aα(G)= Aα we have, for each l ∈ {1, 2,,..., n},
[Aαx(p)]l = Σ [Aα]lk[x(p)]k = [Aα]li − [Aα]lj .	(1)
k=1
Now, consider the following three cases:
Case 1 l = i. In this case,




so,
[Aαx(p)]i = [Aα]ii − [Aα]ij  = αd(vi) − [Aα]ij ,





Case 2 l = jp. In this case,

[Aα

x(p)]i
= ⎧⎨ α(d(vi)+ 1) − 1, se vi ∼ vjp ;
⎩ αd(vi),	se vi /∼ vjp .





and,
[Aαx(p)]j = [Aα]j i − [Aα]j j = [Aα]j i − αd(vj ),


[Aα

x(p)]j
= ⎧⎨ −α(d(vjp )+ 1) + 1, if vi ∼ vjp ;
⎩ −αd(vjp ),	if vi /∼ vjp .

Case 3 l ∈/ {i, jp}.
Since vi and vjp are twin vertices, we have [Aα]li = [Aα]ljp . Then, for equa- tion (1) [Aαx(p)]l = 0.
Therefore, of the three previous cases we have
⎧⎨ (αd(vi)+ α − 1)xp, if vi ∼ vj ;

Aαx(p) =
p
⎩ αd(vi)x(p),	if vi /∼ vj .


It is easy to see that {x(p)}r	is linearly independent. Therefore m(λ) ≥ r, for
λ ∈ {αd(vi), αd(vi)+ α − 1}.

3	Main results
In this section, we present the results involving the eigenvalues of graphs in the family Fn. There is a convenient vertex labelling of a graph Fs,r,t ∈ Fn such that Aα = Aα(Fs,r,t) can be written as


⎡ α(t + s + 2r) (1 − α)J1×s (1 − α)J1×2r (1 − α)J1×t	01×t

Remark 3.1 Let G  Fs,r,t.The graph G has exactly one vertex of degree equal to 2r + s + t, 2r + t vertices of degree equal to 2 and s + t vertices of degree equal to
1. For α = 1 the eigenvalues of A1(G)= D(G) are d(v), v ∈ V (G), and for α =0 the eigenvalues of A0(G)= A(G) can be see in [3].
In Proposition 3.2, we were able to prove that the occurrence of some eigenvalues of a firefly graph depends on the existence of certain induced subgraphs.
Proposition 3.2 Given the nonnegative integers r, s and t, let G  Fs,r,t and

α ∈ (0, 1). If t ≥ 2 then θ1
= 3α+√5α2−8α+4 and θ
= 3α−√5α2−8α+4 are eigenvalues

of G, both with multiplicity at least t − 1. Moreover, if r ≥ 2 then α +1 is an
eigenvalue of G with multiplicity at least r − 1.
Proof. Given λ ∈ {θ1, θ2} suppose t ≥ 2 and, for each i ∈ {1, 2,...,t− 1}, consider

the vector x(i) with 2r + s + 2t + 1 entries, where
⎧ λ − α,  if j = s + 2r + 2;
⎪ 1 − α




[x(i)]j =
⎪⎪⎨

⎪
⎪
⎪⎩
1 − α
1,	if j = s + 2r + t + 2;
−1,	if j = s + 2r + t +2+ i; 0,	otherwise.

In this way, the entries of the vector Aα(G)x(i) − λx(i) are given by


⎧⎪
 A (G)x(i) − λx(i)  = ⎨
λ2	3αλ + α2 + 2α	1

λ2 − 3αλ + α2 + 2α − 1

α	j	⎪ −
⎪⎩
, if j = s + 2r +2+ i;
α − 1
0,	otherwise.


Since λ is a root of the polynomial x2 − 3αx + α2 + 2α − 1, it follows that x(i) is an associated eigenvector to λ. Since {x(i)}t−1 is a linearly independent set, the
multiplicity of λ is at least t − 1.
Now, suppose r ≥ 2 and denote by ek the vector with s + 2r + 2t + 1 coordinates whose k-th entry is equal to 1 and the others entries are zero. For each j, s +2 ≤ j ≤ s + r, it is easy to show that the vector zj = ej − ej+1 + ej+r − ej+r+1 is an eigenvector of Aα(G) associated with the eigenvalue α + 1. So, α + 1 is an eigenvalue of Aα(G) with multiplicity at least r − 1.

Remark 3.3 As described in the Proposition 3.2, we use the notations θ1 and θ2
to represent the roots of the polynomial x2 − 3αx + α2 + 2α − 1.

For s ≥ 1, G  Fs,0,0  Ss and the eigenvalues of Aα(Ss) can be seen in the Proposition 2.2.
Proposition 3.4 Let G  F0,r,0. If r ≥ 1 and α ∈ (0, 1) then

PAα(G)(x)= (x − α − 1)r−1(x − 3α + 1)r(x2 − (2αr + α + 1)x + (6α − 2)r).

Moreover, if x1 and x2 denote the roots of the quadratic factor of PAα(G)(x) then

⎨	3
⎪⎩ 3α − 1 ≤ x2 < α +1 < x1, if 1 < α < 1.


Proof. For G  F0,r,0, we have
⎡
Aα(G)= ⎣

2αr	(1 − α)J1×2r⎤
(1 − α)J2r×1	B2r


where B2r is the matrix given in (3).
Applying the Propositions 2.4 for each triangles of G, we obtain that 3α − 1 is an eigenvalue of Aα(G) with multiplicity at least r and from Proposition 3.2, for r ≥ 2, α + 1 is an eigenvalue of Aα(G) with multiplicity at least r − 1. If r = 1, the result follow by Proposition 2.2.
From Proposition 2.1, the spectrum of matrix
⎡ 2αr 2r(1 − α)⎤
M =	,
1 − α	1+ α

whose characteristic polynomial is g(x)= x2−(2αr+α+1)x+(6α−2)r, is contained in the spectrum of Aα(G). Since 3α − 1 and α + 1 are not roots of g(x), we have

PAα
(G)(x)= (x − α − 1)r−1(x − 3α + 1)rg(x).
6r	3

As G has order n = 2r+1 and size m = 3r, we have d = 2r +1 = 3− 2r +1 ≥ 2.
From Proposition 2.3, λ1(Aα) ≥ 2. Let x1 and x2 be the roots of g(x), with x2 < x1. Since 3α − 1 < α +1 < 2, for α ∈ (0, 1), we conclude that x1 = λ1(Aα). Now, we have g(α + 1) = −2r(α − 1)2 < 0 for all r ≥ 1 and α ∈ (0, 1). On the other hand, g(3α − 1) = −2(r − 1)(α − 1)(3α − 1), thus g(3α − 1) ≤ 0 if α ∈ (0, 1 ] and
g(3α − 1) > 0 if α ∈ ( 1 , 1). So it easy to see that
⎨	3
⎪⎩ 3α − 1 ≤ x2 < α +1 < x1, if 1 < α < 1,

and the equalities only hold if r =1 or α = 1 .

Proposition 3.5 Let G  F0,0,t. If t ≥ 1 and α ∈ (0, 1) then
P	(x)= (x2 − 3αx + α2 + 2α − 1)t−1h(x),

where h(x)= x3 − α(t + 3)x2 + [α2t + (α2 + 2α − 1)(t + 1)]x − 2α(2α − 1)t. If x1, x2 and x3 are the roots of h(x) then x3 < θ2 < x2 < θ1 < x1.

Proof. For G  F0,0,t, we have
⎡	αt	(1 − α)J1×t	01×t	⎤

⎣	0t×1	(1 − α)It	αIt	⎦

From Proposition 3.2, if t ≥ 2, θ1 and θ2 are eigenvalues of Aα(G), both with multiplicity at least t − 1. From Proposition 2.1, the spectrum of matrix
⎡ αt	t(1 − α)	0  ⎤

⎣  0	1 − α	α  ⎦

whose characteristic polynomial is h(x)= x3 − α(t + 3)x2 + [α2t + (α2 + 2α − 1)(t + 1)]x − 2α(2α − 1)t, is contained in the spectrum of Aα(G). As θ1 and θ2 = 3α − θ1

are not roots of h(x), we have P
Aα(G)
(x) = (x2 − 3αx + α2 + 2α − 1)t−1h(x). Since

h(θ1)= −(α − 1)2(θ1 − α)t < 0 and h(θ2)= (α − 1)2(θ1 − 2α)t > 0 for all t ≥ 1 and
α ∈ (0, 1), there is a root of h(x) in (θ2, θ1). As lim h(x)= ∞ and	lim h(x)= 
x→∞	x→−∞
−∞, the previous inequalities imply x3 < θ2 < x2 < θ1 < x1. If t = 1, G  P3 and
the result follows.

Proposition 3.6 Let G  Fs,r,0. If s ≥ 1, r ≥ 1 and α ∈ (0, 1) then

PA (G)(x)= (x − α)s−1(x − 3α + 1)r(x − α − 1)r−1h(x),

where h(x) = x3 − (αs + 2αr + 2α + 1)x2 + ((α2 + 3α − 1)(s + 2r)+ α2 + α)x −
(2α2 + α− 1)s + 2αr(1 − 3α). If x1, x2 and x3 are the roots of polynomial h(x) then

Proof. For G  Fs,r,0, we have

Aα(G)= ⎢ (1 − α)Js×1	αIs	0s×2r

where B2r is the matrix given in (3).
From the vector obtained in the proof of Proposition 2.4 it is possible to obtain r linearly independent eigenvectors related to the eigenvalue 3α − 1 and s− 1 linearly independent eigenvectors associated to the eigenvalue α. By Proposition 3.2, α +1 is an eigenvalue of Aα(G) with multiplicity at least r − 1 and, from Proposition 2.1, the eigenvalues of the reduced matrix
⎡α(s + 2r) (1 − α)s (1 − α)2r⎤

M = ⎢⎣

whose characteristic polynomial is h(x)= x3 − (αs + 2αr + 2α + 1)x2 + ((α2 + 3α − 1)(s + 2r)+ α2 + α)x− (2α2 + α− 1)s + 2αr(1 − 3α), is contained in the spectrum of Aα(G). Note that h(α + 1) = −2(α − 1)2r < 0 and h(α)= (α − 1)2s > 0 for all α ∈ (0, 1), s  1 and r  1. So, h(x) has a root, x2, in (α, α + 1). As lim h(x)=  and
x→∞
h(α + 1) < 0, we concluded that the largest root of h(x), x1, satisfies α +1 < x1. We have h(3α−1) = 2(1−α)[(3α2 −3α+1)s+(6α2 −5α+1)(r−1)]. As 3α2 −3α+1 > 0
for all α ∈ (0, 1) and 6α − 5α +1 ≥ 0 for α ∈ 0,  ∪  , 1 we have h(3α − 1) > 0

for all α	0, 1	1 , 1 . As	lim
3	2	x→−∞
3	2
h(x) = −∞ we have x3 < min
{3α − 1, α}.

Similarly, when α ∈ 1 , 1 , it is shown that max{x3, 3α − 1} < α. It is easy to sort
the eigenvalues of Aα(G) and the result follows.

Proposition 3.7 Let G  Fs,0,t. If s ≥ 1 and t ≥ 1 then

PAα(G)(x)= (x − α)s−1(x2 − 3αx + α2 + 2α − 1)t−1h(x),

where h(x) = x4 − α(s + t + 4)x3 + [(3α − 1)(α + 1)(s + t + 1)+ α2]x2 − α[(α2 + 2α − 1)(s + 2t + 1)+ (2α − 1)(3s + t)]x + (2α − 1)[α2(s + 2t)+ (2α − 1)s]. Moreover, the polynomial h(x) has four distinct roots, x1, x2, x3 and x4, such that x4 < θ2 < x3 < α < x2 < θ1 < x1.

Proof. For G  Fs,0,t, we have
⎡ α(s + t)	(1 − α)J1×s (1 − α)J1×t	01×t	⎤
A (G)= ⎢(1 − α)Js×1	αIs	0s×t	0s×t	⎥ .

From Proposition 2.4, α is eigenvalue of Aα(G) with multiplicity at least s − 1. If t = 1, θ1 and θ2 are not eigenvalues of Aα(G). From Proposition 3.2, if t ≥ 2, θ1 and θ2 are eigenvalues of Aα(G), both with multiplicity at least t − 1. From Proposition 2.1, the eigenvalues of the reduced matrix
⎡α(s + t) (1 − α)s (1 − α)t	0  ⎤

Since α, θ1 and θ2 are not roots of h(x), we have PAα(G)(x)= (x − α)	(x  −
3αx + α2 + 2α − 1)t−1h(x). The above inequalities imply that the polynomial h(x)
has a root in the interval (θ2, α) and other root in the interval (α, θ1). Moreover, as h(θ1) < 0 and lim h(x) =	, there is a root of h(x) in the interval (θ1,	).
x→∞
Similarly, we conclude that h(x) has the smallest root in the interval (−∞, θ2).

The next propositions, whose proofs are similar to the previous results, complete all cases in the family Fn.
Proposition 3.8 Let G  F0,r,t. If r ≥ 1, t ≥ 1 and α ∈ (0, 1) then
PAα(G)(x)= (x − 3α + 1)r(x − α − 1)r−1(x2 − 3αx + α2 + 2α − 1)t−1h(x),

h(x) then

Moreover, g(x) has ﬁve roots x1, x2, x3, x4, x5 which are arranged as
x5 < θ2 < x4 < min{3α − 1, α} < max{3α − 1, α} < x3 < θ1 < x2 < α +1 < x1
and the result follows.
