Abstract
A biclique of a graph G is a maximal induced complete bipartite subgraph of G. The edge-biclique graph of G, KBe(G), is the edge-intersection graph of the bicliques of G. A graph G diverges (resp. converges or is periodic) under an operator H whenever limk→∞ |V (Hk(G))| = ∞ (resp. limk→∞ Hk(G)= Hm(G) for
some m or Hk(G)= Hk+s(G) for some k and s ≥ 2). The kth-iterated edge-biclique graph of G, KBk(G), is the graph obtained by applying the edge-biclique operator k successive times to G. In this paper we study the iterated edge-biclique operator KBe. In particular, we give sufficient conditions for a graph to be convergent or divergent under the operator KBe and we propose some conjectures on the subject.

Introduction
Intersection graphs of certain special subgraphs of a general graph have been studied extensively. We can mention line graphs (intersection graphs of the edges of a graph), interval graphs (intersection graphs of a family of subpaths of a path), and in particular, clique graphs (intersection graphs of the the family of all cliques of a graph) [4,5,8,11,12,27,29].
The clique graph of G is denoted by K(G). Clique graphs were introduced by Hamelink in [19] and characterized in [33]. It was proved in [1] that the clique graph recognition problem is NP-Complete.
The clique graph can be thought as an operator from Graphs into Graphs. The iterated clique graph Kk(G) is the graph obtained by applying the clique operator k successive times. It was introduced by Hedetniemi and Slater in [20]. Much work has

been done in the field of the iterated clique operator, looking at the possible different behaviors. The goal is to decide whether a given graph converges, diverges, or is periodic under the clique operator when k grows to infinity. This question remains open for the general case, moreover, it is not known if it is computable. However, partial characterizations have been given for convergent, divergent and periodic graphs, restricted to some classes of graphs. Some of them lead to polynomial time algorithms to solve the problem.
For the clique-Helly graph class, graphs which are convergent to the trivial graph have been characterized in [3]. Cographs, P4-tidy graphs, and circular-arc graphs are examples of classes where the different behaviors were also characterized [7,22]. On the other hand, divergent graphs were considered. For example, in [31], fam- ilies of divergent graphs are given. Periodic graphs were studied in [8,26]. It has been proved that for every integer i, there are graphs with period i and graphs which converge in i steps. More results about iterated clique graphs can be found in [9,10,23,24,25,32].
A biclique is a maximal bipartite complete induced subgraph. Bicliques have applications in various fields, for example biology: protein-protein interaction net- works [6], social networks: web community discovery [21], genetics [2], medicine [30], information theory [18], etc. More applications (including some of these) can be found in [28]. The biclique graph of a graph G, denoted by KB(G), is the inter- section graph of the family of all bicliques of G. It was defined and characterized in [16]. However no polynomial time algorithm is known for recognizing biclique graphs. As for clique graphs, the biclique graph construction can be viewed as an operator between the class of graphs.
The iterated biclique graph KBk(G) is the graph obtained by applying to G the biclique operator k times iteratively. It was introduced in [15] and all possi- ble behaviors were characterized. It was proven that a graph is either divergent or convergent, but never periodic (with period bigger than 1). Also, general char- acterizations for convergent and divergent graphs were given. These results were based on the fact that if a graph G contains a clique of size at least 5, then KB(G) or KB2(G) contains a clique of larger size. Therefore, in that case G diverges. Similarly if G contains the gem or the rocket graphs as an induced subgraph, then KB(G) contains a clique of size 5, and again G diverges. Otherwise it was shown that after removing false-twin vertices of KB(G), the resulting graph is a clique on at most 4 vertices, in which case G converges. Moreover, it was proved that if a graph G converges, it converges to the graphs K1 or K3, and it does so in at most 3 steps. These characterizations led to an O(n4) time algorithm (later improved to O(n + m) time [13]) for recognizing convergent or divergent graphs under the biclique operator.
The edge-biclique graph of a graph G, denoted by KBe(G), is the edge- intersection graph of the family of all bicliques of G. We recall that edge-intersection means that KBe(G) has a vertex for each biclique of G and two vertices are adja- cent in KBe(G) if their corresponding bicliques in G share an edge (and not just a vertex as in KB(G)). The edge-biclique graph KBe(G) was defined in [17] and

studied in [14], however there is no characterization so far to recognize edge-biclique graphs.
In this work we study edge-biclique graphs not only because of their mathe- matical interest but also because in real-life problems, bicliques often represent the relation between two types of entities (each partition of the biclique) therefore if would make sense to study when two objects (bicliques) share a common relation- ship (an edge) more than just an entity (a vertex). In particular, we focus on the iterated edge-biclique graph, denoted by KBk(G), and defined as the graph obtained by applying the edge-biclique operator k successive times to G. We give some non- trivial sufficient conditions for a graph to be convergent or divergent under the KBe operator and we propose some conjectures that would help to fully characterize the behavior of a graph under the KBe operator.
This work is organized as follows. In Section 2 the necessary notation is given. In Section 3 and Section 4 we present some results about convergent and divergent graphs, respectively. Finally, in Section 5 we state some conjectures on the subject.

Preliminaries
Along the paper we restrict to undirected simple graphs. Let G = (V, E) be a graph with vertex set V (G) and edge set E(G). A clique of G is a maximal com- plete induced subgraph, while a biclique is a maximal bipartite complete induced subgraph of G. The open neighborhood of a vertex v ∈ G, denoted N (v), is the set of vertices adjacent to v while the closed neighborhood of v, denoted by N [v], is N (v) ∪ {v}. A path (cycle) on k vertices (k ≥ 3), denoted by Pk (Ck), is a set of vertices v1, v2, ..., vk ∈ G such that vi /= vj for all 1 ≤ i /= j ≤ k and vi is adjacent to vi+1 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ k − 1 (and vk is adjacent to v1). A graph is connected if there exists a path between each pair of vertices. The girth of G is the length of a shortest induced cycle in the graph. We assume that all graphs of this paper are connected.
Given a family of sets H, the intersection graph of H is a graph that has the members of H as vertices, and there is an edge between two sets E, F ∈H when E and F have non-empty intersection.
A graph G is an intersection graph if there exists a family of sets H such that G is the intersection graph of H. We remark that any graph is an intersection graph [34].
Let H be any graph operator and let G be a graph. The iterated graph under the operator H is defined iteratively as follows: H0(G)= G and for k ≥ 1, Hk(G)= Hk−1(H(G)). We say that G diverges (resp. converges or is periodic) under the operator H whenever limk→∞ |V (Hk(G))| = ∞ (resp. limk→∞ Hk(G) = Hm(G) for some m or Hk(G)= Hk+s(G) for some k and s ≥ 2). The study of the behavior of a graph G under the operator H consists of deciding if G converges, diverges or is periodic under H.
We assume that the empty graph is convergent under the operator KBe, as it is obtained by appyling the edge-biclique operator to a graph that does not contain

any bicliques.
Convergence
To start this section we have this first easy result.
Lemma 3.1 For n ≥ 2, the complete graph Kn converges to the empty graph under the operator KBe in two steps.
Proof. Clearly each edge of Kn is a biclique that does not edge-intersect with another one. Then KBe(G) consists of n(n−1) isolated vertices (and no bicliques), therefore KB2(G) is the empty graph.	2
Next we show that graphs without induced cycles of length 3 and 4 are conver- gent.
Theorem 3.2 If G has girth at least ﬁve, then the edge-biclique operator applied to G converges towards the graph induced by the union of all the cycles and paths connecting cycles of G.
Proof. If G has girth at least five, then every biclique is a star. Moreover G has no triangles, so N (v) is a stable set and thus, for each v of degree more than one, N [v] is a maximal biclique. Notice also that if u is adjacent to v, N [u] and N [v] contain a common edge, therefore the vertices in KBe(G) corresponding to the bicliques N [u] and N [v] will be adjacent. We can conclude that KBe(G) is exactly the graph induced by all vertices of degree at least two of G. For k big enough, the only vertices left in KBk(G) are those which belong to cycles or to paths connecting cycles, that is, G converges under the operator KBe towards the graph induced by the cycles and paths connecting cycles of G.	2
As an immediate result of Theorem 3.2, we obtain the following corollary.
Corollary 3.3 If G has girth at least ﬁve and has no vertices of degree one, then
KBe(G)= G.
One natural question that arises from Corollary 3.3 is: Given a graph G such that KBe(G)= G, does G have girth at least five and no vertices of degree one? The answer is no, for instance, the graph C7 shown in Figure 1 satisfies that KBe(G)= G but its girth is three 2 .


Fig. 1. The graph C7 is the smallest graph satisfying KBe(G)= G with girth less than five.

From Theorem 3.2, we also obtain the following result.
Corollary 3.4 For every k ≥ 1, there is a graph that converges in k steps under the operator KBe.
Proof. Just take any induced cycle Cn, n ≥ 5, and join one of its vertices to the endpoint of a simple path Pk. Observe that this graph converges to Cn in exactly k steps.	2
Corollary 3.5 Trees converge to the empty graph under the operator KBe.
Divergence
In this section we study the divergence of the operator KBe. We start first with the following definition.
Definition 4.1 Let G be a graph and let C = v0v1	vn—1 be an induced cycle of
length n ≥ 5. We say that C has good neighbors whenever for all vertices v ∈ G−C, if {vi—1, vi+1} ⊆ N (v) then vi ∈ N (v), for i = 0,.	,n − 1 and all subindices taken
(mod n). (see Fig 2).


Fig. 2. G has a cycle with good neighbors while G′ has not, since v is adjacent to vi−1 and vi+1 but not adjacent to vi.
Now we present an important proposition that assures that the good neighbors property is invariant through the iterations of the operator KBe.
Proposition 4.2 Let G be a graph and let C = v0v1 ... vn—1 be an induced cycle of length n ≥ 5 with good neighbors. Let Bi, i = 0,...,n − 1, be bicliques in G containing the vertices {vi—1, vi, vi+1} (mod n), respectively, Bi ⊆ N [vi], and let bi, i = 0,...,n − 1, be the vertices in KBe(G) corresponding to the bicliques Bi ∈ G. Then Cj = b0b1 ... bn—1 is an induced cycle of KBe(G). Moreover, Cj has good neighbors.
Proof. As C is an induced cycle in G, let Bi, i = 0,...,n − 1, be bicliques that contain the vertices {vi—1, vi, vi+1} (mod n), respectively. Clearly, each Bi intersects Bi+1 in the edge vivi+1, therefore if we call bi, i = 0,...,n − 1, the corresponding vertices in KBe(G) to the bicliques Bi, then we have that b0b1 ... bn—1 form a cycle Cj in KBe(G). Now, let v ∈ G be a vertex in Bi − {vi—1, vi, vi+1}. As Bi is a

biclique of G, either v is adjacent to vi—1 and vi+1 but not adjacent to vi, which is not possible because C has good neighbors, or v is adjacent to vi. Therefore, for all i = 0,...,n − 1, Bi ⊆ N [vi] and Cj is an induced cycle of KBe(G).
Now, let b ∈ KBe(G) − Cj be a vertex such that {bi—1, bi+1}⊆ N (b) for some i. If B is the biclique of G corresponding to the vertex b ∈ KBe(G), then B contains vi—1 and vi+1, since Bi—1 ⊆ N [vi—1] and Bi+1 ⊆ N [vi+1]. As vi—1 and vi+1 are not adjacent in G, there exists a vertex v ∈ B ∩ Bi—1 ∩ Bi+1 such that v is adjacent to both vi—1 and vi+1. If v /= vi, since C has good neighbors, v must also be adjacent to vi, contradicting the fact that v ∈ Bi—1 (or Bi+1). Therefore, v = vi and B and Bi have an edge in common, that is, b is adjacent to bi in KBe(G) and thus Cj has good neighbors.	2
Before the main theorem, we define the following family of graphs.
Definition 4.3 For n ≥ 3 and m ≥ 1, the (n, m)−necklace graph on n+m vertices consists of an induced cycle Cn and a complete graph Km, such that for an edge e ∈ Cn, every vertex of the Km is adjacent to both endpoints of e. (see Fig 3).

Fig. 3. (5, 1) — necklace and (6, 3) — necklace graphs.
Now we present the main theorem of this section.
Theorem 4.4 Let G be a graph that contains an induced (n, m) −necklace, n ≥ 5,
m ≥ 1, such that its cycle has good neighbors. Then, either KB2(G) or KB3(G)
e	e
contains an induced (n, mj) − necklace such that its cycle has good neighbors, and
mj > m.
Proof. Let Cn = v0v1 ... vn—1 be the induced cycle and Km = {w1,..., wm} be the complete graph of the (n, m) − necklace, respectively. Let vivi+1, for some i ∈ {0,...,n − 1} (mod n), be the edge of the Cn such that wj is adjacent to vi and vi+1 for all j = 1,..., m. Let Bt, t = 0,...,n − 1, be bicliques that contain the vertices {vt—1, vt, vt+1} (mod n), respectively, and let bt, t = 0,...,n − 1, be the corresponding vertices in KBe(G) to the bicliques Bt. By Proposition 4.2,
j = b0b1 ... bn—1 is an induced cycle in KBe(G) with good neighbors.
Consider the following two families of bicliques B1 = {B1 : {wj, vi, vi—1} ⊆
B1,j = 1,..., m} and B2 = {B2 : {wj, vi+1, vi+2} ⊆ B2,j = 1,..., m}. Clearly, all
j	j	j
these 2m bicliques are different and moreover, they are different to the bicliques Bt
for t = 0,...,n − 1 as Cn has good neighbors. Now we can see that (Tm  B1) ∩

Bi—1 ∩ Bi = {vi—1, vi} and (Tm  B2) ∩ Bi+1 ∩ Bi+2 = {vi+1, vi+2}. Therefore if b1
j=1	j	j
and b2, j = 1,..., m, are the corresponding vertices in KBe(G) to the bicliques B1

j
and B2, we have that in KBe(G), K1
= {b1,..., b1 } and K2
j
= {b2,..., b2 } are

j	m	1	m	m	1	m
two complete graphs such that b1 is adjacent to bi—1 and bi, and b2 is adjacent to
j	j
bi+1 and bi+2, for all j = 1,..., m. Notice that as Cn has good neighbors in G, then

in KBe(G) we have N (b1) ∩ Cj = {bi—1, bi} and N (b2) ∩ Cj
= {bi+1, bi+2}, for all

j	n	j	n
j = 1,..., m.
Now, let B˜t, t = 0,...,n − 1, be the bicliques of KBe(G) that contain the vertices {bt—1, bt, bt+1} (mod n), respectively, and ˜bt, t = 0,...,n − 1, be the cor-
responding vertices in KB2(G) to the bicliques B˜t.  Again, by Proposition 4.2,
Cjj = ˜b0˜b1 ... ˜bn—1 is an induced cycle in KB2(G) with good neighbors.
n	e
Now for each b1, j = 1,..., m, we have that {b1, bi, bi+1} is contained in a biclique
j	j
B˜1. Similarly, for each b2, j = 1,..., m, {b2, bi, bi+1} is contained in a biclique B˜2.
In the worst case (to minimize the number of bicliques), if there is exactly a perfect
matching between K1 and K2 , say b1 is adjacent to b2, for each j = 1,..., m, then
m	m	j	j
B˜1 = B˜2. We have the following two cases:
j	j
Case A: There is at least one vertex b1 ∈ K1 not adjacent to any vertex of K2 .
1	m	m
Clearly, B˜1 /= B˜2, for all j = 1,..., m, and furthermore, these m + 1 bicliques are
different to the bicliques B˜t for t = 0,...,n − 1. Observe that (Tm  B˜2) ∩ B1 =
{bi, bi+1} and moreover, B˜i ∩B˜i+1 = {bi, bi+1}. Therefore, if ˜b1 and ˜b2, j = 1,..., m,
are the corresponding vertices in KB2(G) to the bicliques B˜1 and B˜2, respectively,
we have that in KB2(G), {˜b1, ˜b2,..., ˜b2 } is a complete graph on m + 1 vertices such
that, as Cj has good neighbors, every vertex of this Km+1 is only adjacent to ˜bi and
to ˜bi+1 on the cycle Cjj. That is, KB2(G) contains an induced (n, m + 1) −necklace
such that its cycle Cjj has good neighbors. See Fig 4 for an example where K1 and
n	m
2 have no edge in-between.


Fig. 4. Graphs G containing an (n, m) — necklace, KBe(G), and KB2(G) containing an (n, 2m) — necklace.


Case B: Every vertex of K1
is adjacent to at least one vertex of K2
(and by

symmetry every vertex of K2 is adjacent to at least one vertex of K1 ). As explained

above, the worst case is when there is a perfect matching between K1 and K2 .
Without loss of generality, suppose that b1 is adjacent to b2 for each j = 1,..., m,
j	j
otherwise we would obtain at least m+1 bicliques having the edge bibi+1 in common
and therefore KB2(G) will contain an induced (n, m + 1) − necklace such that its

cycle Cjj
has good neighbors. As there is a matching between K1
and K2 , let

B˜j
be the bicliques that contain the set {b1, bi, bi+1, b2} for each j = 1,..., m.

These bicliques contain the edge bibi+1 and they are different to the bicliques B˜t for t = 0,...,n − 1. Then, if ˜bj , j = 1,..., m, are the corresponding vertices in
KB2(G) to the bicliques B˜j , we have that in KB2(G), {˜bj ,..., ˜bj } is a complete
graph on m vertices such that, as Cj has good neighbors, every vertex of this Km
is only adjacent to ˜bi and to ˜bi+1 on the cycle Cjj.
Now for each b1, j = 1,..., m, we have that {b1, bi—1, bi—2} is contained in a 
j	j
biclique B˜1. All these m bicliques have the edge bi—1bi—2 in common. In addition,
they are clearly different to the bicliques B˜t, t = 0,...,n − 1 and B˜j , j = 1,..., m. Suppose now that there is an edge in common between the bicliques, say B˜1 and
B˜j . Then, there must exist a vertex b ∈ KBe(G) adjacent to bi—2, b1 and bi+1.
This implies that in G, there must exist a biclique B (corresponding to the vertex

b ∈ KBe(G)) that has edges in common with the bicliques Bi—2, B1
and Bi+1.

Therefore, as Cn has good neighbors, there must a vertex v ∈ B adjacent to the vertices vi—2 and vi+1. Finally, as B has an edge in common with the biclique B1, v must be adjacent to either to vi, or to vi—1 and w1. In both cases we obtain a contradiction as B would contain either the K3 = {v, vi, vi+1} or the K3 =
{v, vi—2, vi—1} which is not possible if B is a biclique. We can conclude then that there are no edges in common between the bicliques B˜1 and B˜j , for all j = 1,..., m.
Now let ˜b1 be the vertices in KB2(G) corresponding to the bicliques B˜1 of KB(G),
for j = 1,...,m respectively. Then, these vertices form a Km in KB2(G) and they
are only adjacent to the vertices ˜bi—2 and ˜bi—1 of the cycle Cjj.
Now, let βt, t = 0,...,n − 1, be bicliques of KB2(G) that contain the vertices
{˜bt—1, ˜bt, ˜bt+1} (mod n), respectively, and β˜t, t = 0,...,n − 1, the corresponding vertices in KB3(G) to the bicliques βt. By Proposition 4.2, Cjjj = β˜0β˜1 ... β˜n—1 is
an induced cycle in KB3(G) with good neighbors. To finish, consider the following two families of bicliques: β1 = {β1 : {˜b1, ˜bi—1, ˜bi}⊆ β1,j = 1,..., m} and β2 = {β2 :
{˜bj , ˜bi—1, ˜bi} ⊆ β2,j = 1,..., m}. Clearly, all these 2m bicliques are different as
there are no edges in common between the bicliques B˜1 and B˜j , for all j = 1,..., m,
and moreover, they are different to the bicliques βt for t = 0,...,n − 1 as Cjj has good neighbors. Since all these 2m bicliques contain the edge ˜bi—1˜bi, then if β˜1 and β˜2, j = 1,..., m, are the corresponding vertices in KB3(G) to the bicliques β1 and
β2, respectively, we have that in KB3(G), {β˜1,..., β˜1 , β˜2,..., β˜2 } is a complete
graph on 2m vertices such that, as Cjjj has good neighbors, every vertex of this K2m
is only adjacent to β˜i and to β˜i—1 on the cycle Cjjj. That is, KB3(G) contains an
induced (n, 2m) − necklace such that its cycle Cjjj has good neighbors. See Fig 5
for a representation of this case.	2

m	m	e
the complete graphs, and KB3(G) containing an (n, 2m) — necklace.
As a corollary, we obtain the following divergence theorem.
Theorem 4.5 Let G be a graph that contains an induced (n, m) −necklace, n ≥ 5, m ≥ 1, such that its cycle has good neighbors. Then G diverges under the operator KBe.
Proof. Applying Theorem 4.4 several times, we obtain that either KB2(G) or KB3(G) contains an induced (n, mj) − necklace, and mj > m, then that either KB4(G), KB5(G) or KB6(G) contains an induced (n, mjj)−necklace, and mjj > mj,
e	e	e
etc, all having its cycles with good neighbors. Therefore, G is divergent under the
operator KBe as limk→∞ |V (KBk(G))| = ∞.	2
To finish the section, we obtain a second corollary.
Corollary 4.6 Let G be a graph and let Cn be an induced cycle of length n ≥ 5 with good neighbors. If there is a vertex v ∈ G − Cn such that N (v) ∩ Cn has at least one edge and not all Cn, then G diverges under the operator KBe.
Proof (Sketch) Observe that either G, KBe(G) or KB2(G), contain an (n, 1) − necklace, n ≥ 5, such that its cycle has good neighbors. Therefore G diverges under the operator KBe following Theorem 4.5.	2

5	Open problems
We propose the following conjectures.
Conjecture 5.1 A graph G is either divergent or convergent under the KBe oper- ator but never periodic (with period bigger than 1).

Conjecture 5.2 G = KBe(G) if and only if either G = C7, G = G9 (see Fig. 6) or G has girth at least ﬁve and has no vertices of degree one.

Note that Corollary 3.3 along with the fact that KBe(C7)= C7, KBe(G9)= G9 prove the “only if” part of Conjecture 5.2.
Conjecture 5.3 It is computable to decide if a graph diverges or converges under the operator KBe.


 	

Fig. 6. Graphs C7 and G9 satisfying KBe(G)= G with girth less than five.
Conjecture 5.4 A graph G is divergent under the operator KBe if and only if there exists some k such that KBk(G) contains an induced (n, m)−necklace, n ≥ 5, m ≥ 1, with its cycle having good neighbors.
Clearly Theorem 4.5 proves the “only if” part of Conjecture 5.4 and moreover, the “if” part along with Conjecture 5.1 imply Conjecture 5.3.
