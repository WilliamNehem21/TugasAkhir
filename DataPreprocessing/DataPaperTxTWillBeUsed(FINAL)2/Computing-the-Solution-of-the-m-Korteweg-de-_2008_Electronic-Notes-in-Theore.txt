Abstract
In this paper, we study the initial value problem of the mKdV equation, and convert the constant coefficients mKdV equation into its standard norm by linear transformation. Then, we define a nonlinear map KR : Hs(R) C(R,Hs(R)) (s ≥ 1 ), from the initial data to the solution of the equation, and prove KR is Turing computable for any integer s ≥ 3. Therefore, the solution of the mKdV equation with arbitrary
precision on Turing machines can be satisfied.
Keywords: mKdV equation, conservation equation, computable, Turing machines.


1	Introduction
In engineering and other scientific computation there are a lot of practical applica- tions which are related to finding solutions of some kind of differential equations. It is always a great challenge for mathematicians to determine whether the equa- tions of certain type have solution and, if it is the case, how these solutions can be computed. Unfortunately, this task cannot always be satisfactorily fulfilled for all equations. However, there are a lot of special equations whose solutions do exist and can be exactly and precisely specified. Those equations are usually called ex- actly solvable equations. The Korteweg-de Vries equation (KdV equation for short) ut + uux + uxxx = 0 is a good example of such kind of equations. Actually, earlier, Gay, Zhang and Zhong[4] studied the Cauchy of the Korteweg-de Vries equation posed on a periodic domain, defined the nonlinear operator and proved that the op- erator is computable. Later, Klaus Weihrauch and Ning Zhong [12]have shown that

the solution operator of the KdV equation is computable on real line in the frame- work of Type-2 computability theory. In this paper, we extend the investigations of
[12] to the modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equations ut + αu2ux + βuxxx = 0 
for α, β ∈ R.
The mKdV equations are used to describe the acoustic spread of non-harmonic Lattice and the Alfen wave sport of non-collision plasma in plasma physics, solid physics, atomic physics, hydrodynamics and the theory of quantum, etc. The mKdV equations have been intensively studied from various aspects of both physics and mathematics. Anne Boutet de Monvel and Dmitry Shepelsky [9] have analyzed an initial-boundary value problem for the mKdV equation in a finite interval. F. Gesztesy and B. Simon [5]have constructed solutions of the mKdV equation. Jing Yu and Ruguang Zhou[15] have presented two kinds of integrable decompositions of the mKdV equation. Turabi Geyikliand and Dogan Kaya [6]have obtained a numerical solution to mKdV equation. In[1,2,3,14], more new kinds of solutions such as periodic wave solutions and solitary wave solutions have been obtained. The mKdV equation has widespread application. Therefore, it is very significant to study the solution operator of the equation.
Our goal is to show that the solution operator of mKdV equations is also com- putable in the same framework as in [12]. Although a similar approach to that of
[12] is used in this paper, the construction is more complicated because the non- linearity of the mKdV equation is stronger than the KdV equation. Especially, we need conservation equations of the mKdV equation and use properties of Banach algebra to prove our main result. It seems that this method can be further applied to study the operator of the generalized KdV equations.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we recall the Turing machine, Type 2 theory of effectivity, basic spaces, and representations. In Section 3, we prove the main result and put the tedious inferential process of the proof to Section 4 which contains also three estimates and their proofs for the purpose of effectively determining a computable subsequence.

2  Preliminaries
The computability of subsets and functions on the discrete (countable) sets is usually defined by means of Turing machines. Both inputs and outputs of a Turing machine are finite words. In order to investigate the computability on uncountable sets, the Turing machines have been extended by Klaus Weihrauch [11] so that their inputs and outputs can be infinite sequences as well. These machines are usually called Type 2 Turing machines and they can be used to define the computability on the set Σω of infinite sequences in an analogous way while the (classic) Turing machines introduce the computability to the set Σ∗ of finite sequences on the alphabet Σ. If we want to introduce the computability to other set D of a cardinality up to continuum, we can choose a representation δ : Σω	D of D which is simply a surjective function. That is, the representation δ assigns (possibly infinite) names (δ-names) to each element x ∈ D and transfers the computability on Σω straightforwardly

to the set D. For example, an element x D is called δ-computable if it has a computable δ-name.
In order to investigate the computability of the solution operation of various dif- ferential equations, we have to introduce the corresponding computability notion to the function spaces at first. In this section, we recall the definitions of computability on several function spaces which are necessary for our discussions. They essentially belong to Klaus Weihrauch and Ning Zhong [12].
Usually, we are interested in the computability on some metric spaces. If a metric space (M, d) has a countable dense subset, then we can define its effectivization as a computable quadruple metric space M = (M, d, A, ν) in which (1) A is a dense subset of M , (2) ν :  Σ∗  A is a surjective function ( so-called notation of A); and (3) the set u, v, w, x Σ∗ : νQ(w) < d(ν(u), ν(v)) < νQ(x) is a recursively enumerable set, where νQ : Σ∗  Q is the standard notation of the rational numbers. In a computable metric space (M, d, A, ν) we can introduce the computability to the following Cauchy representation δC :⊆ Σω → M which is a surjective function such that δC (p) = x if and only if p = w0#w1#w2# ··· for wi ∈ dom(ν) and the sequence {ν(wi)} converges effectively to x in the sense that d(x, ν(wi)) ≤ 2−i for all i ∈ N.
For example, let L2(R) be the set of all L2-functions, i.e., the functions f meet the condition that ( f (x) 2dx)1/2 <  and let d be the standard L2-norm defined by dL2 (f, g) = ||f − g|| = ( R | f (x) − g(x) |2 dx)1/2. Then the L2-function space (L2(R), dL2 ) has a countable dense subset σ consisting of all rational finite step
functions. Let vL2 be a canonical notation of σ. Thus we achieve the computable metric space (L2(R), dL2 , σ, vL2 ). On this computable metric space we can define the Cauchy representation δL2 as follows: a sequence p ∈ Σω is a δL2 -name of g ∈ L2(R) (i.e., δL2 (p) = g) if and only if p = w0#w1#w2# ··· with wi ∈ dom(vL2 ) and ||vL2 (wi) − g|| ≤ 2−i for all i ∈ N.
In order to prove our main theorem, we need to introduce some representations of the Schwardtz space. Let the Schwardtz space S(R) be the set of all functions φ ∈ C∞ (R), such that sup |xαφ(β) (x) | < ∞ for all α, β ∈ N,where C∞ (R) is the

x R
space of complex-valued functions of class C∞
topology. Let ds be the metric defined by
equipped with the compact open



∞
ds(φ, ϕ) = 
α,β=0
2−<α,β> 	φ − ϕ α,β 
1+	φ − ϕ α,β

∀α, β ∈ N



where ⟨α, β⟩ is the bijective Cantor pairing function, defined by < α, β >:= β + (α + β)(α + β + 1)/2, and  φ α,β:= supx∈R | xαφ(β)(x) |. Then the space (S(R), ds) has a dense subset P∗ consisting of the set of truncated polynomials with
rational coefficients. Let νp be the canonical notation of P∗ . Thus we obtain the

∞
computable metric space (S(R), ds, P
∗, νp ). Let δ	:⊆ Σω
→ S(R) be the Cauchy

representation. However, we have to introduce another representation of S(R) for

the proof, denoted as δs, defined by

δP (p) = φ	and
δs (⟨q, p⟩) = φ ⇔ ⎪⎨ q = u0#u1#u2 ··· , where uk ∈ dom (vN)

sup
|x|≥vN(u<i,j,n>)
|xiφ(j) (x) | ≤ 2−n

Remark 2.1 δP  is the Cauchy representation of the computable metric space
(C∞(R)	c	∞p), where dc is the metric defined as follows:

,d , P,ν 


∞
dc(φ, ϕ) = 
α,β=0


2−<α,β> 	φ − ϕ  α,β  ,
1+	φ − ϕ α,β

P is the set of polynomials with rational coefficients, and νp is a canonical notation of P . νN is a canonical notation of the set N.
The representations on L2(R) and S(R) lead straightforwardly to a representa- tion of the Sobolev space Hs(R). By definition, the Sobolev space consisits of all functions f ∈ L2(R) such that Ts(f ) ∈ L2(R), where
Ts(f )(ξ) := (1 + |ξ|2)s/2F(f )(ξ)
is a weighted Fourier transform of f with weight (1 + |ξ|2)s/2 and F(f ) denotes the Fourier transform of f . An infinite word p ∈ Σω is a δHs -name of f ∈ Hs(R), iff p is a δL2 -name of the weighted transform Ts(f ) L2(R)(i.e δHs (p) = Ts−1 δL2 (p)). During the proof, we also need another representation of Hs(R). When s ≥ 0 is an integer, Hs(R) is the same as the set: {f ∈ L2(R) : the kthorder derivative fk of f is in L2(R) for all 0 ≤ k ≤ s}, define the norm as following:
 f (x, t)  s= (  f (x, t)  2 +  f'(x, t)  2 + ··· +  f (s)(x, t)  )1/2
An infinite word p ∈ Σω is δ˜Hs -name of f , iff p = ⟨p0, p1, p2, ·· ·⟩ with pi ∈ dom(δsc) and  δsc(pi) − f s≤ 2−i.
Remark 2.2 S(R) is dense in Hj(R) for all j ∈ N. If f (t) ∈ S(R) ,we can see that
f (t) ∈ Hj(R), in particular , Dj f (t) ∈ L2 (R) for all j ∈ N and t ∈ R
Finally, we consider the representation of functions. Suppose that we have two sets M and M' with the representations δ :  Σω	M and δ' :  Σω	M', respectively. We say that a function f : M  M' is (δ, δ')-computable if there is a type-2 Turing machine which transfers any δ-name of an x dom(f ) to a δ'-name of f (x) for any x dom(x). It is well known that, any (δ, δ')-computable function is (δ, δ')-continuous. Here a function f : M  M' is (δ, δ')-continuous if there is a continuous function g : Σω  Σω which transfers any δ-name of x  dom(f ) to a δ'-name of f (x). Denote by C(M, M') the set of all (δ, δ')-continuous functions from M → M'. For the set C(M, M'), there is a canonical representation (see [11])

[δ → δ'] : Σω → C(M, M') such that a function f is (δ, δ')-computable iff it has a computable [δ → δ']-name.

3	Main result
In this section, we will prove our main result, that is, the solution operator of the mKdV equations is computable. We explain in this section the essential idea of how this result can be proved. Some technical details will be given in Section 4.
Precisely, we are interested in the following initial value problem (IVP, for short) of mKdV equation on the real line R,


​

u (x, 0) = ϕ (x) ∈ Hs(R)
By a computable linear transformation u =	 1	 u', x = β1/3x' and t = t',
αβ−1/3

the IVP (1) can be transformed computably to the following


(2)

⎩ u (x, 0) = ϕ (x) ∈ Hs(R)

Thus, it suffices to consider only the IVP (2) because any computable solution of
leads straightforwardly by a computable reverse transformation to a computable solution of (1). Originally, the IVP (2) looks for a function u of two arguments which satisfies both equations from any given function ϕ. However, if we write the function u as a functional u(x, t) := u(t)(x), then the IVP (2) can be regarded equivalently as a solution operator mapping a function ϕ to the functional u : t  u(t) where u(t) : R  R is a real function of one argument. Furthermore, the initial function ϕ is in the Sobolev space Hs(R), then (2) does have a solution u which, as a functional,
is a continuous function from R to Hs(R) for any s  1 (see[7]). In other words, the
IVP (2) has a solution operator KR : Hs(R)  C(R; Hs(R)).The special solidary wave solution possessed by the mKdV equation in [2] is



u(x, t) =  6csech(  c (x − ct))

where c is wave speed. The solution is obviously computable when c is computable real number. Our main result asserts that this solution operator is actually com- putable in the framework of type-2 computability theory.
Theorem 3.1 The solution operator KR : Hs(R) → C (R; Hs(R)) of the initial value problem (2) is (δHs , [ρ → δHs ])-computable for any integer s ≥ 3.
During the proof, firstly we will give the equivalent integral equation of the IVP(2), and use the iterative approach to solute this integral equation. Secondly, we prove that this iterative sequence is computable, and converges uniformly in t ∈ [0,T ]. Thus, the limit of the converging sequence will also be computable, and

satisfy the equivalent integral equation of the IVP(2). In other words, the limit will be the solution of the IVP(2), and then the solution will be computable.
The following is the equivalent integral equation of the initial value problem (2)

We show that the following iterative sequence with the initial data ϕ as the seed:
⎧⎨ v0 (t) = F−1 (E (t) ·F (ϕ))

⎩ vj+1 (t) = v0 (t) − 1 ∫ t F−1 E (t − τ ) ·F  d (vj (τ ))3  dτ.
The iterative sequence (4) is contracting near t = 0, thus the sequence converges to a unique limit. Since the limit satisfies the integral equation (3), it is the solution of the initial value problem (2) near t = 0. To prove that the solution operator is computable, we need to construct a type-2 Turing machine which computes fast approximations to the solution u (t) when given enough information on the initial data ϕ.The machine will be designed in such a way that is capable of computing the iterative sequence in (4) when inputting Schwartz function. Thus for any given initial data ϕ Hs (R) and any δ˜Hs -name p0, p1 .. . of ϕ, the machine is able to compute the iterative sequence for each seed δsc (pi).We recall that δsc (pi) is an approximation to ϕ in Hs (R) with accuracy 2−i.
Firstly, we define the operator

which  is  ([ρ → δs], δs, ρ, δs)-computable.	This follows from Lemma 3.2 in
[12] straightforwardly.	Therefore, the function S¯(u, ϕ)(t)	:=	S(u, ϕ, t)  is
([ρ	δs], δs, [ρ	δs])-computable. Then we define the function v : S(R)	N
C(R : S(R)) by

v(ψ, 0) = S¯(0, ψ)
v(ψ, j + 1) = S¯(v(ψ, j), ψ).
It is easy to verify that v is (δS, γN, [ρ → δS])-computable.
Proof. (of Theorem 3.1) For a given initial value ϕ  Hs(R) and a rational number
T¯ > 0 we will show how to compute the solution u(t) of the initial value problem
(2) at the time interval 0 ≤ t ≤ T¯. For this purpose, we first find some appropriate rational number T such that 0 < T < T¯, and show how to compute u(t) from t' and ψ := u(t') at the time interval [t', t' + T ], 0 ≤ t' ≤ T¯, by a fixed point iteration.Using this method, we can compute the values u (T /2m) successively for m = 1, 2,  and finally u (t) for any 0 ≤ t ≤ T¯.

If ut+u2ux+uxxx = 0,u (x, t') = ψ (x), and v is defined by v (x, t) := u (x, t + t') ,
then


​
⎧ vt + v2vx + vxxx = 0	x ∈ R,t ≥ 0,
⎩ v(x, 0) = ψ(x).

We assume that the initial value ψ ∈ Hs(R) is given by a δ˜Hs -name, i.e., by a sequence ψ0, ψ1, ··· of Schwartz functions such that  ψ − ψn  s≤ 2−n. For any n ∈ N, we define function v0, v1, ··· ∈ C(R : S(R)) by
v0 := S¯(0, ψn),	vj+1 := S¯(vj , ψn).
n	n	n
We note that the sequence {vj } can be computed from ψ . If the iterative sequence
v0, v1, ··· converges to some vn, then vn is the fixed point of the iteration S¯ and
satisfies the following internal equation:

​
vn (t)= S¯ (vn,ψn)

hence vn solves the initial value problem:

​
∂vn + v2 ∂vn + ∂vn = 0,	and	v

We will show that, by a contraction argument, for some sufficiently small com-
putable real number T > 0 (depending only on ϕ and T¯), vj (t) → v (t) as j →∞ 
for all n, and vn (t)  v (t) as n	, sufficiently fast and uniformly in t [0,T ]. We recall that v is the solution of the initial value problem (5). Then we can effec- tively determine a computable subsequence of the double sequence vj which will converge fast to v uniformly in t [0,T ].The inferential process is tedious,we will finish it in next section.
Since v is the limit of a fast convergent computable sequence, v itself is com- putable. So KR : (ϕ, t) '→ u (t) is (δHs , ρ, δHs )-computable for t ≥ 0, the re- flection R : S (R) → S(R), R(ψ)(x) := ψ(−x), is (δHs , δHs )-computable. Define u' (t) (x) := u ( t) ( x).  Then u't + u'2u'x + u'xxx = 0 and for t ≥ 0,u ( t) =
R  u' (t) = R  KR (u' (0) , t) = R  KR (R (ϕ) , t), i.e., u (t) = R  KR (R (ϕ) ,  t) for
t ≤ 0. Therefore, as the two computable functions join at 0, KR is computable for
t ∈ R. (see e.g. Lemma 4.35 in [12]).	 
4	Three estimates
From the above section, we obtain the result that vn is the solution of the IVP(9), and  ψ  ψn  s  2−n. If the sequence  v  vn  s is controlled by  ψ  ψn  s, we can obtain the result that the sequence vn converges uniformly. For the purpose of effectively determining a computable subsequence vj that is convergent fast and uniformly, we need three estimates listed below as Propositions 4.1,4.6,4.9. In the first proposition, we prove the solution of IVP(2) can be controlled by the initial function ϕ(x).

Proposition 4.1 If u (x, t) is the solution of the IV P (2), Then there is a com- putable function e : N R R R which is non-decreasing in the second and third argument such that

sup
0≤t≤T
 u (x, t)  s≤ es (  ϕ  s) ,

where es (r) := e (s, T, r), s is an integer and s ≥ 3.
In order to prove the proposition, we need to introduce the conservation equa- tion. As we know, there are three significant conservation laws in the area of physics, which are conservation of mass, of energy and of momentum. In the area of math- ematics, when a physical problem can be described by a differential equation, like ut = k(u), the conservations law of this equation can be described as the following form:

(10)
∂T + ∂X = 0.

∂t	∂x
Where T and X are relative to u(x, t), X = 0 on the boundary of the field of definition. From (10) we know that I = T dx is irrelative to t. From the mKdV equation, we have the following:

During the proof, we need the following inequalities, which are in common use and whose proofs are seen in [8].
Lemma 4.2 (Young’s inequality) For p, q > 1, p−1 + q−1 = 1 and a, b ≥ 0,
ab ≤ εap + c(ε)bq,
where c(ε) = (p − 1) / pqε 1  .

 f L∞ ≤  f 1 and  f L∞ ≤ √2  f 1/2  f' 1/2
Lemma 4.4 (Gronwall’s inequality) If, for any t ≥ 0 and a, b > 0, Dtx (t) ≤

x (t) ≤ x (0) eat + b eat − 1 ,
for any t ≥ 0, in particular,
x (t) ≤ x (0) eaT + b eaT − 1 

for any 0 ≤ t ≤ T.
Since  u(x, t)  s= ( u(x, t)  2 +  u'(x, t)  2 +	+  u(s)(x, t)  )1/2, we give the following lemma 4.5 firstly.
Lemma 4.5 There is a computable function C : N × R × R → R, such that for any

Now we can prove the Proposition 4.1
Proof. (of Proposition 4.1) Let es (y) = (1 + C1 + C2 + ··· + Cs ) · y. By Lemma

This proves Proposition 4.1	 
We will prove the convergence of the iterative sequence {vj } about j.
Proposition 4.6 Let v0 := S¯(0, ϕ), and vj+1 := S¯(vj, ϕ). If αs T 1/2(3 + T )3/2
 ϕ  2 +8(3 + T )αs T 1/2  ϕ  s≤ 1, then we have

where αs = (es (  ϕ  s)+ 1)·√s·2s·(2s + 1)·T 1/2 +1 , for all 0 ≤ t ≤ T , ϕ ∈ Hs (R).
Firstly, we will construct the space to obtain the estimate of the nonlinearity of the mKdV equation, and then prove the Proposition 4.6.

From  v0 Xs =  W (t) ϕ  Xs ≤ (3 + T )1/2  ϕ  s we obtain by induction
 vj  Xs ≤ 2 (3 + T )1/2  ϕ  s (for all j ∈ N)

Therefore, for 0 ≤ t ≤ T ,

if 24αs T 1/2 (3 + T )3/2  ϕ  2 +8 (3 + T ) αs T 1/2  ϕ  s≤ 1. This proves Proposi-
tion 4.6.	 
From the above proof, if we use vj instead of vn, when j → ∞, we can obtain
the result vj → vn. Then we will prove the uniform convergence of the sequence
{vn} or {vn}.
Proposition 4.9 v (t) = S¯ (v, ψ) (t) , vn (t) = S¯ (vn, ψn) (t) ,

 v (t) − vn (t)  ≤ 2 (3 + T )1/2  ψ − ψn

Proof. Since v (t) = S¯ (v, ψ) (t) , vn (t) = S¯ (vn, ψn) (t) , by Lemma 4.8 in [8],we obtain the result as following:

v − vn  Xs = W (t) (ψ − ψn) − 3

where as = √s · 2s · T 1/2 + 1(see[8]). By Proposition 4.6 (notice that  ψn s≤ 
ψ  s +1, ) if 24αs T 1/2 (3 + T )3/2 (  ψ  s +1)2 + 8αs T 1/2 (3 + T )(  ψ  s +1) ≤ 1,

then

Therefore  v − vn Xs ≤ 2 (3 + T )1/2  ψ − ψn s, the sequence {vn} is uniform
convergence.	 
Thus, by Proposition 4.6 and 4.9, the sequence vj converges fast to v uni- formly in t  [0 , T ]. We can see that the machine searches fast approximations to u(x, t), and computes the solutions of mKdV equation with arbitrary precision. This approach can be extended to other nonlinear equations.
