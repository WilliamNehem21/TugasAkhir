Abstract
We establish some results on some variants of the Hausdorff difference hierarchy. In particular, we extend the recently developed theory of difference hierarchy over the open sets in ω-algebraic domains to a similar theory for ω-continuous domains, and prove some analogs of the Hausdorff-Kuratowski theorem for k- partitions. We discuss also a broad class of effective topological spaces closely relevant to our study of the difference hierarchy and to computability in topology.
Keywords: Space, computably enumerable space, difference hierarchy, limit hierarchy, k-partition, ω-continuous domain.


Introduction
The aim of this paper is two-fold. First, we continue to study some versions of the classical Hausdorff difference hierarchy (DH). Second, we discuss in some detail a class of effective topological spaces introduced in [12,24] which is relevant to our study of the DH and to computability in topology.
The non-effective DH in Polish spaces is well-understood [10]. Recently, a com- plete theory of the DH over the open sets in ω-algebraic domains was developed [19]. For the DH over higher levels of Borel hierarchy, many questions remain open. Many basic questions remain open also for the effective version of the DH which is closely relevant to computable analysis [6,7].
Generalizations of the DH from the case of subsets A of a topological space X (identified with the characteristic functions cA : X → {0, 1}) to the case of k- partitions ν : X → k of X (for any integer k ≥ 2 identified with the set {0,..., k−1}) are quite natural and relevant to computable analysis, in particular to degrees of

discontinuity [8,9,17,18,21,23]. For a set X, let P (X) be the set of subsets of X and kX the set of k-partitions of X. For any C ⊆ P (X), let co-C be the set of complements of sets in C and let Ck be the set of C-partitions (more exactly, C- measurable k-partitions), i.e., partitions ν ∈ kX such that ν−1(i) ∈ C for each i < k. The last notion is naturally extended to partial k-partitions ν : X - k.
In this paper we establish some new results on the DH and its versions. In particular, we extend the theory of DH over the open sets in ω-algebraic domains to a similar theory for ω-continuous domains, and prove some analogs of the Hausdorff- Kuratowski theorem for k-partitions. In Section 2 we discuss (in a slightly modified and extended form) a natural broad class of effective topological spaces [12] that includes the computable metric spaces [24] and computably enumerable (c.e.) α- spaces [4]. This class is very convenient for development of the effective descriptive set theory. In Section 3 we develop the theory of DH over the open sets in ω-algebraic domains and discuss open problems about the effective DH. In Section 4 we establish some new facts on the so called limit hierarchy of k-partitions previously studied
e.g. in [8,5,16,22]. Finally, in Section 5 we prove some new facts (in particular, an analog of the Hausdorff-Kuratowski theorem) for the DH of k-partitions [22] that refines the limit hierarchy.
Countably Based T0-Spaces
Here we briefly discuss some notions related to countably based T0-spaces and com- putability over them. Ideas and many of results here are not new. They are slight modifications and/or extensions of those in [12] (see also Exercise 3.2.17 in [24]).

Spaces
By a space we mean here a pair (X, ξ) where X is a nonempty set and ξ : ω → P (X) a numbering of subsets of X with the following properties:  ξ(ω) = X; there is a sequence {Aij} of subsets of ω such that ξi ∩ ξj =  ξ(Aij) for all i, j ≥ 0; Oξ(x) /= Oξ(y) for all distinct x, y ∈ X where Oξ(x) = {i | x ∈ ξi}. We denote by P (X) the set of subsets of X, by ξi = ξ(i) the value of ξ on i and by ξ(A) the image of A under ξ.
Obviously, if (X, ξ) is a space then ξ(ω) is a basis of the T0-topology {  ξ(A) | A ⊆ ω} on X and, conversely, if B is a countable basis of a T0-topology on X then for any surjection ξ : ω → B the pair (X, ξ) is a space in our sense. Thus, our “spaces” are essentially the countably based T0-spaces with a fixed numbering of a basis. In particular, we may speak about continuous functions between spaces. If (X, ξ) and (Y, η) are spaces then f : X → Y is continuous iff there is a sequence
{Ai} of subsets of ω such that f−1(ηi) =  ξ(Ai) for all i ≥ 0. Note also that if
(X, ξ) is a space and Y is a nonempty subset of X then (Y, η), ηi = Y ∩ ξi, is a space, and the topology on Y is induced by the topology on X.
We introduced the technical notions of a space and describe some easy properties of spaces below because this straightforwardly leads to a broad natural class of “effective” topological spaces discussed in the next subsection.

An important example of a space is (P (ω), δ) where δi = Dˇi = {A ⊆ ω | Di ⊆ A} and {Di} is the standard numbering of the finite subsets of ω [13]; we denote the corresponding T0-space by Pω. The following assertion shows that Pω may be used to code all spaces.
Proposition 2.1 Let (X, ξ) and (Y, η) be spaces.
The map Oξ : X → Pω is a homeomorphic embedding.
For any continuous function f : X → Pω there is a continuous function
f˜ : Pω → Pω such that f = f˜◦ Oξ.
For any f : X → Y , if the function Oη ◦ f : X → Pω is continuous then f
is continuous.
A function f : X → Y is continuous iff there is a continuous function
f˜ : Pω → Pω such that Oη ◦ f = f˜◦ Oξ.
Proof. (i) Since the sets nˇ = {A ⊆ ω | n ∈ A}, n ≥ 0, form a prebasis in Pω and O−1(nˇ) = ξn, Oξ is continuous. Since Oξ(ξn) = nˇ ∩ Oξ(X), Oξ(ξn) is an open set in the subspace Oξ(X) for all n ≥ 0. Therefore, Oξ is a homeomorphism between X and Oξ(X).
(ii) Since f is continuous, there is a sequence {An} of subsets of ω such that
f−1(nˇ) =  ξ(An) for all n ≥ 0. For any A ⊆ ω, let f˜(A) = {n | An ∩ A /= ∅}. Then
n ∈ f˜(Oξ(x)) ↔ An ∩ Oξ(x)) /= ∅↔ ∃m ∈ An(x ∈ ξm) ↔ x ∈  ξ(An)
— f (x) ∈ nˇ ↔ n ∈ f (x),
hence f = f˜◦ Oξ. One easily checks that f˜ is continuous.
The assertion (iii) follows from (i) while (iv) follows from (ii) and (iii).	 
For ξ, η : ω → P (X), let ξ ≤ η mean that there is a sequence {An} of subsets of ω such that ξn = η(An) for all n ≥ 0. Then ≤ is a preorder; we denote the induced equivalence relation by ≡. Obviously, for any spaces (X, ξ) and (X, η), ξ ≤ η iff the topology induced by η refines that induced by ξ. Clearly, rng(ξ) ⊆ rng(η) implies ξ ≤ η. If ξ∗ is any numbering of the nonempty sets in rng(ξ) then ξ∗ ≡ ξ.
We conclude this subsection by a short discussion of two important classes of spaces. The first class is closely related to separable metric spaces, i.e., metric spaces (X, d) having a countable dense set D ⊆ X. Fixing a surjection ν : ω → D induces the space (X, ξ) where ξ = ξν,d is defined by ξ⟨m, n⟩ = {x ∈ X | d(ν(m), x) < νQ(n)}, where ⟨ , ⟩ is a computable Cantor paring function and ν : ω → Q is a standard computable numbering of the rationals. Obviously, rng(ν) = rng(ν') implies ξν,d ≡ ξν',d and the topology induced by ξ coincides with that induced by metric d.
The second class is closely related to the α-spaces [4] defined as follows. On any T0-space X there is the specialization partial order (defined by: x ≤ y, if x ∈ U implies y ∈ U , for any open set U in X) and the approximation relation (defined by: x ≺ y, if y is in the interior of the set xˇ = {z ∈ X | x ≤ z}). The approximation relation is transitive and x ≺ y implies x ≤ y. A T0-space X is an α-space if for any open set U ⊆ X and any x ∈ U there is a b ∈ U with b ≺ x. A base set

in an α-space X is a subset B of X such that for any open set U ⊆ X and any x ∈ U there is a b ∈ U ∩ B with b ≺ x. The class of α-spaces contains several interesting subclasses, including the so called ϕ- f - and A-spaces, and is closely related to domain theory [4,1]. In particular, the continuous (resp., ω-continuous) domains essentially coincide with the complete α-spaces (resp., complete α-space with a countable base set). An important example of an α-space is Pω.
Let X be an α-space with a countable base set B. Fixing a surjection ν : ω → B induces a space (X, ξ) where ξ = ξν is defined by ξn = {x ∈ X | νn ≺ x}. Obviously, rng(ν) = rng(ν') implies ξν ≡ ξν' and the topology induced by ξ coincides with the topology on X.
Computably Enumerable Spaces
Notions of this subsection are obtained by a straightforward “effectivization” of the corresponding notions from the previous subsection. In particular, we require that sequences of subsets of ω discussed above should be (uniformly) c.e.
A space (X, ξ) is called c.e. if the set {n | ξn /= ∅} is c.e. and there is a c.e.
sequence {Aij} such that ξi ∩ ξj =  (Aij) for all i, j ≥ 0. Note that if (X, ξ) is a c.e. space and Y ⊂ X then the (Y, ξY ) need not be a c.e. space (because the first effectivity condition is not true in general). But in some natural cases (Y, ξY ) is a c.e. space. E.g., this holds if Y is effectively open (see below). Many popular spaces (e.g., the space of reals R, the space Pω, the Baire space ωω and the Baire domain ω≤ω are c.e. with respect to natural numberings of a basis The c.e. space (ω, ξ), where ξn = {n}, is trivial from topological point of view but interesting for computability theory.
For ξ, η : ω → P (X), let ξ ≤c η mean that there is a c.e.  sequence {An} of subsets of ω such that ξn =  η(An) for all n ≥ 0. Then ≤c is a preorder; we denote the induced equivalence relation by ≡c. For a c.e. space (X, ξ), set ξ'(n) = ξg(n) where g is a total computable function enumerating the nonempty
c.e. set {n | ξn /= ∅}; then ξ' ≡c ξ. Set also ξW (n) =  ξ(Wn) where W is the standard numbering of c.e. sets. Then ξW is a numbering of the effectively open sets, (X, ξW ) is a c.e. space and ξW ≡c ξ.
Next we notice that two classes of spaces important for the study of com- putability in analysis and topology are subclasses of the c.e. spaces. Recall that a computable metric space [24] is a triple (X, d, ν) where (X, d) is a metric space and ν : ω → X is a numbering of a dense subset rng(ν) of X such that the set
{⟨i, j, q, r⟩| νQ(q) < d(νi, νj) < νQ(r)} is c.e. As follows from [24,12], if (X, d, ν) is a computable metric space then (X, ξν,d) is a c.e. space.
A computable α-space is a pair (X, ν) where X is an α-space and ν : ω → X is a numbering of a base subset rng(ν) of X such that the set {⟨i, j⟩| νi ≺ νj} is c.e. Similar to a particular case in [12] one checks that if (X, ν) is a computable α-space then (X, ξν) is a c.e. space.
Let (X, ξ) and (Y, η) be c.e. spaces. A function f : X → Y is called effectively continuous if there is a c.e. sequence {Ai} of subsets of ω such that f−1(ηi) = 
  ξ(Ai) for all i ≥ 0. It is easy to check that a function f on P (ω) is an enumeration

operator [13] (i.e., an operator A '→ {j | ∃i(⟨i, j⟩∈ W ∧ Di ⊆ A)} for some c.e. set
W ) iff it is an effectively continuous function on (P (ω), δ). Next we establish the effective version of Proposition 2.1.
Proposition 2.2 Let (X, ξ) and (Y, η) be c.e. spaces.
The map Oξ : X → Pω is an effective homeomorphic embedding.
For any effectively continuous function f : X → Y there is an enumeration operator f˜ : P (ω) → P (ω) such that f = f˜◦ Oξ.
For any f : X → Y , if the function Oη◦f : X → Pω is effectively continuous then f is effectively continuous.
A function f : X → Y is effectively continuous iff there is an enumeration operator f˜ : P (ω) → P (ω) such that Oη ◦ f = f˜◦ Oξ.
Proof. More precise formulation of (i) says that the space (Z, δZ), where Z = Oξ(X), is c.e. and both Oξ and its inverse are effectively continuous. Since O−1(Dˇn) =   ξ(Dn), and, by the effectivity conditions,   ξ(Dn) =   ξ(Bn) for a c.e. sequence {Bn}, Oξ is effectively continuous. To show that (Z, δZ) is a c.e. space, it suffices to check that the set {n | δn∩Oξ(X) /= ∅} is c.e. This follows from
δn ∩ Oξ(X) /= ∅↔ O−1(Dˇn) /= ∅↔  ξ(Dn) /= ∅↔ ∃m ∈ Bn(ξm /= ∅).

The remaining assertions are checked in the same way as the corresponding non-effective versions in the proof of Proposition 2.1(only now the corresponding sequences are c.e.).	 
The next result shows that the effectively continuous functions in the spaces corresponding to computable metric spaces [24] and to α-spaces [1] coincide with the computable functions in the sense of computable analysis and topology. The assertion (i) is proved in [12] while the assertion (ii) is a slight modification of the corresponding fact in [12] and of Theorem 3.2.14 in [24].
Proposition 2.3 (i) Let (X, d, ν) and (Y, e, μ) be computable metric spaces. A function f : X → Y is computable w.r.t. the Cauchy representations of (X, d, ν) and (Y, e, μ) iff f is an effectively continuous function from (X, ξd,ν) to (Y, ξe,μ).
(ii) Let (X, ν) and (Y, μ) be c.e. α-spaces. A function f : X → Y is a computable function from (X, ν) to (Y, μ) (i.e., the relation ηm ≺ f (νn) is c.e.) iff f is an effectively continuous function from (X, ξν) to (Y, ξμ).
Difference Hierarchies of Sets
In this section we improve some previous results on the DH, in particular extend the theory in [19] to the ω-continuous domains.

Non-Effective Hierarchies
Let us recall [10,19,20] that Borel hierarchy in a topological space X is the sequence
{Σ0 }α<ω  of subclasses of P (X) defined by induction on α as follows: Σ0 = {∅},
α	1	0

Σ0 is the class of open sets, Σ0 is the class of countable unions of finite Boolean
1	2
combinations of open sets, and Σ0 (for α > 2) is the class of countable unions of
sets in	Π0 , where Π0 = co-Σ0 .  Classes Σ0 , Π0 and Δ0 = Σ0 ∩ Π0 are
called levels of the Borel hierarchy. If we want to stress the space X in which the levels are considered we can use a more complicated notation like Σ0 (X).
The following easy assertion [19] extends a well-known fact for Polish spaces [10]. A class C has the σ-reduction property, if for each countable sequence C0, C1,... in C there is a countable sequence C' , C' ,... in C (called a reduct of C0, C1,.. .) such
that C' ∩ C' = ∅ for all i /= j and	C' =	Ci.
Proposition 3.1 For any topological space X and any α ≥ 2, the class Σ0 has the
σ-reduction property. The class Σ0 does not in general have the reduction property.
Next we recall definition and basic facts about the DH. An ordinal α is called even (odd) if α = λ + n where λ is not a successor, n < ω and n is even (resp., odd). For an ordinal α, let r(α) = 0 if α is even and r(α) = 1 otherwise. For any ordinal α, define the operation Dα sending sequences of sets {Aβ}β<α to sets by

Dα({Aβ}β<α) =  {Aβ \  Aγ | β < α, r(β) /= r(α)}.
γ<β

For all ordinals α and classes of sets C, let Dα(C) be the class of all sets
Dα({Aβ}β<α), where Aβ ∈C for all β < α.
Definition 3.2 Let X be a space and {Σ0 } the Borel hierarchy in X. For any β,
0 < β < ω1, the sequence {Dα(Σ0 )}α<ω is called the DH over Σ0 . The DH over
β	1	β
Σ0 is called simply the DH in X and is denoted by {Σ−1}α<ω .
1	α	1
As usual, let Π−1 denote the dual class for Σ−1, and Δ−1 = Σ−1 ∩ Π−1. It is
α	α	α	α	α
well-known and follows easily from the definitions above (see also [10,20] for details)
that Dα(Σ0 ) ∪ co-Dα(Σ0 ) ⊆ Dγ(Σ0 ) ⊆ Δ0	for all α, β and γ with α < γ < ω1
β	β	β	β+1

and 0 < β < ω1. In particular, Σ−1
⊆ Δ−1
⊆ Δ0.  The following nontrivial

properties of the DH’s are well-known [10].
Theorem 3.3 Let X be a Polish (i.e., a countably based complete metrizable) space and 0 < β < ω1.
{Dα(Σ0 )|α < ω1} = Δ0	(this assertion is known as the Hausdorff-

β
Kuratowski theorem).
β+1

If X is non-countable then the DH over Σ0 does not collapse, i.e., Dα(Σ0 ) /⊆
β	β
co-Dα(Σ0 ) for each α < ω1.
Next we explain how to extend the theory of the DH over Σ0 in ϕ-spaces [19] to the α-spaces (X, B) with a fixed base set B ⊆ X. Since the proofs are small modifications of those in [19], we concentrate on exact formulations. We use some standard notation and terminology on partially ordered sets (posets) which may be found e.g. in [2]. We apply notions about posets also to preorders, meaning the corresponding quotient-poset of the preorder.  A poset (P ; ≤) will be often

shorter denoted just by P . Any subset of a poset P may be considered as a poset with the induced partial order. In particular, this applies to the “upper cones” xˇ = {y ∈ P | x ≤ y} defined by any x ∈ P . A well preorder is a preorder P that has neither infinite descending chains nor infinite antichains. For the well-founded preorders there is a canonical rank function rkP assigning ordinals to the elements of P ; the rank of P is the supremum of ranks of its elements.
By a forest we mean a poset without infinite chains in which every upper cone xˇ is a chain. A tree is a forest having the biggest element (called the root of the tree). It is well-known that rank of any countable tree without infinite chains is a countable ordinal, and any countable ordinal is the rank of such a tree.
A k-poset is a triple (P ; ≤, c) consisting of a poset (P ; ≤) and a labeling c : P → k. The rank of a k-tree (T ; ≤, c) without infinite chains is by definition the rank of (T ; ≤). A homomorphism f : (P ; ≤, c) → (P '; ≤', c') of k-posets is a monotone function f : (P ; ≤) → (P '; ≤') respecting the labelings, i.e., satisfying c = c' ◦f . Let P˜k (F˜k, T˜k) denote the class of all countable k-posets (resp. k-forests,
k-trees) without infinite chains. The h-preorder ≤ on P˜k is defined as follows:
(P, ≤, c) ≤ (P ', ≤', c'), if there is a homomorphism from (P, ≤, c) to (P ', ≤', c'). A k-tree (T ; ≤, c) ∈ Tk is repetition-free if c(x) /= c(y) whenever y is an immediate successor of x in (T ; ≤). Any tree Tk is h-equivalent to a repetition-free tree in Tk
[21].
Let (X, B) be an α-space, ν ∈ kX and T = (T, ≤, t) ∈ Tk. By a ν-representation of T we mean a function g : T → B such that t = ν◦g and x < y implies g(x) ≺ g(y). The rank of a representation g is the rank of T . A k-tree T is ν-representable if there exists a ν-representation of T . In the particular case when k = 2, A = ν ⊆ X and T is a repetition-free 2-tree we obtain the notions of alternating tree introduced in [19]; such a tree g : T → B is 1-alternating if g(r) ∈ A (where r is the root of T ), otherwise it is 0-alternating. We call a set A ⊆ X approximable if for any x ∈ A there is b ≺ x such that b ∈ B and {y ∈ X | b ≺ y ≺ x}⊆ A.
The next assertions is checked similarly to the corresponding facts in [19] for
ω-algebraic domains.
Theorem 3.4 Let X be an ω-continuous domain and A ⊆ X.
For any α < ω1, A ∈ Σ−1 iff both sets A and A¯ are approximable and there is no 1-alternating tree for A of rank α.
A ∈ Δ0 iff both A and A¯ are approximable iff A ∈ Σ−1 for some α < ω1.
2	α
We conclude this subsection by formulating sufficient conditions for the non- collapse of the DH’s. By a reflective continuous domain we mean an ω-continuous domain X with a bottom element ⊥ such that for some continuous functions q0, e0, q1, e1 : X → X there hold q0e0 = q1e1 = idX , and e0(X), e1(X) are disjoint open sets. By a 2-reflective continuous domain we mean an ω-algebraic domain X with a top element T such that there exist continuous functions q0, e0, q1, e1 : X → X and open sets B0, C0, B1, C1 with the following properties: q0e0 = q1e1 = idX ; B0 ⊇ C0 and B1 ⊇ C1; e0(X) = B0 \ C0 and e1(X) = B1 \ C1; B0 ∩ B1 = C0 ∩ C1.
Many natural domains are reflective or 2-reflective [18,20](in particular, Pω is 2-

reflective). The following fact is again an extension of the corresponding fact for algebraic domains.
Theorem 3.5 Let X be a reflective or a 2-reflective continuous domain. Then the difference hierarchy does not collapse, i.e., Σ−1 /= Π−1 for all α < ω1.

Effective Hierarchies
Here we briefly discuss effective versions of hierarchies form the previous subsec- tion. Such effective versions may be defined in many topological spaces with some effectivity conditions, in particular in our c.e. spaces. Following a tradition of de- scriptive set theory, we denote levels of effective hierarchies in the same manner as levels of the corresponding classical hierarchies, using the lightface letters Σ, Π, Δ instead of the boldface Σ, Π, Δ in the previous subsection.
First let us sketch a definition of the effective Borel hierarchy in arbitrary c.e. space (X, ξ). We start with the numbering ξW (n) =  ξ(Wn) of the effective open sets in X. Let β : ω → P (X) be the numbering of finite Boolean combinations of effective open sets induced by ξW and the Go¨del numbering of Boolean terms.
Finite effective Borel hierarchy in (X, ξ) is the sequence {Σ0 }n<ω defined as follows:
Σ0 = {∅}; Σ0 is the class of of effective open sets equipped with the numbering ξW ;
0	1
Σ0 is the class of sets  β(Wx), x ≥ 0, equipped with the numbering induced by
W ; Σ0 (n ≥ 3) is the class of sets  γ(Wx), x ≥ 0, equipped with the numbering
induced by W , where γ is the numbering of Π0	induced by the numbering of Σ0
(which exists by induction).
The transfinite extension of {Σ0 }n<ω is also defined in a natural way [13,20]. In place of ω1 one has to take the first non-computable ordinal ωCK. In fact, to obtain
reasonable effectivity properties one should enumerate levels Σ0	of the transfinite
hierarchy not by computable ordinals α < ωCK but rather by their names |a|O = α in the well-known Kleene notation system (O; <O) (a '→ |a|O is a surjection from O ⊆ ω onto ωCK). Levels of the transfinite version are defined in the same way as for the finite levels, using the effective induction along the well-founded set (O; <O)
[13]. In this way we obtain the effective Borel hierarchy {Σ0 }a∈O properties of
which are effective versions of properties of Borel hierarchy [13,20].

The effective DH {D(a)(Σ0
)}a∈O, over any level Σ0
, |b|O ≥ 1, is defined by a

similar effectivization of the non-effective DH [19,20]. It is well-known and easy to

see that the effective DH’s satisfy the usual inclusions D(a)(Σ0
) ⊆ D(c)(Σ0
) ∩ co-

D(c)(Σ0
) and D(a)(Σ0
) ⊆ Δ0 b
for all a, c ∈ O, a <O c) and do not collapse (at

least, in ω, in the Baire space ωω and in the Cantor space 2ω ). From [19] it follows
that they do not collapse also in all effective reflective and 2-reflective continuous domains.
The effective DH over Σ0 in the space ω, denoted by {Σ−1}a∈O, was introduced
1	(a)
and comprehensively studied in [3], in particular we have the effective Hausdorff
theorem  {Σ−1 | a ∈ O} = Δ0.  Moreover,  {Σ−1 | a ∈ O, |a|O = ω2} = Δ0
and ω2 is the smallest ordinal with this property. In [15] this was extended to the

effective DH’s over Σ0  for each b ∈ O, |b|O > 1 (i.e., the effective Hausdorff theorem
holds in ω) but, when |b|O increases, one needs bigger and bigger ordinals in place of ω2. In [16] we have shown that the transfinite effective DH over Σ0 in ωω (and in 2ω ) also exhausts Δ0 (i.e., the effective Hausdorff theorem holds) but this time we have the strict inclusion  {Σ−1 | a ∈ O, |a|O = α}⊂ Δ0 for each α < ωCK. In
(a)	2	1
[7] the same fact was obtained for the Euclidean spaces.
We guess that the effective Hausdorff-Kuratowski theorem holds in arbitrary c.e. ω-continuous domain but the proof will be technically much more involved than the proof of Theorem 3.4(ii). Still more problematic is the status of effective analogs of Theorem 3.4(i). Currently we have no idea how a characterization of Σ−1-sets in
c.e. ω-continuous domains could look like.
Limit Hierarchies of k-Partitions
It is well-known that the DH is closely related to limiting “computations” [10]. In this section we discuss this relation.
Let X, Y be topological spaces, f : X - Y a partial function and α, θ countable
nonzero ordinals. We say that f is a Σ0-function if A ∈ Σ0(Y ) → f−1(A) ∈ Σ0(X).
θ	θ	θ
We say that f is an α-Σ0-function if there is a sequence {fβ}β<α of Σ0 partial

θ
functions from	to
( ) = 
(	) and
θ
( ) =	(
) for

each x ∈ dom(f ), where β is the least ordinal satisfying x ∈ dom(fβ). Note that the
Σ0-functions coincide with the 1-Σ0-functions, and domain of any α-Σ0-function
θ	θ	θ
is Σ0. For a partial function f : X - Y and an element y ∈ Y , let fy : X → Y
denote the y-totalization of f defined by fy(x) = f (x) for x ∈ dom(f ) and fy(x) = y otherwise.
Applying the above definitions to the discrete space Y = {0,...,k−1} we obtain the corresponding notions for (partial) k-partitions of X. A simple example of a partial Σ0-partition is a constant function sending all elements of a Σ0-set to a

θ
fixed i < k. For k ≥ 2, i < k and α < ω1, let Ci
θ
be the set of i-totalizations of

partial α-Σ0 k-partitions, and Ck,α be the set of total α-Σ0 k-partitions. Similar to
θ	θ

This shows that the sequence {Ci }α, which we call here the limit-hierarchy of

Proposition 4.1 Let X be a topological space and θ a countable nonzero ordinal
such that Δ0	=  {Dα(Σ0) | α < ω1}. Then (Δ0	)k =  {Ck,α | α < ω1}.
Proof. The inclusion from right to left is easy. Conversely, it suffices to show that

any ν ∈ (Δ0	)k is an α-Σ0-partition for some α < ω1. Since ν−1(i) ∈ Δ0
for all

θ+1	θ	θ+1
i < k, there is a limit ordinal α < ω1 such that ν−1(i) ∈ Dα(Σ0) for all i < k. Since
α is limit, α = k · α. Let g : α → α be the unique monotone embedding such that any β < α is uniquely representable as β = g(γ)+ i, for some γ < α and i < k.
By remarks above, any ν−1(i) is a total α-Σ0 2-partition; let, for any i < k,
{fi }β<α be a corresponding sequence of Σ0 partial functions from X to 2. For any
β	θ

β < α, let fβ be the constant function with domain Ai = {x ∈ X | fi (x) = 1} and
range {i}, where β = g(γ)+ i. Then the sequence {fβ}β<α of partial constant Σ0
k-partitions witnesses that ν is an α-Σ0 k-partition.	 
From Proposition 4.1 and Theorems 3.3 and 3.4 we obtain “limit character-
izations” of the Δ0	-measurable k-partitions in arbitrary Polish spaces for any
nonzero θ < ω1, and of Δ0-measurable k-partitions in arbitrary ω-continuous do-
main.
It is straightforward to get the effective analog of Proposition 4.1.

Difference Hierarchies of k-Partitions
Here we discuss the DH (known also as the Boolean hierarchy) of k-partitions stud- ied for the case of finite k-posets in [11,17] and for the countable case in [21,23].
Let P = (P ; ≤) be a countable poset without infinite chains, X a topological space and let L⊆ P (X) be closed under finite intersections and countable unions. Functions of the form S : P → L are called P-families and are denoted also by
{Sp}p∈P . A P -family is monotone if it is a monotone function from (P ; ≤) into (L; ⊆). A P -family S is admissible if  p Sp = X and Sp ∩ Sq ⊆  {Sr | r ≤ p, q} for all p, q ∈ P . Note that if P is a forest then P -family S is admissible iff p Sp = X and Sp ∩ Sq = ∅ for all p, q incomparable in P . For any P -family S, define a map S˜ : P → P (X) by S˜p = Sp \  q<p Sq. It is easy to see that if S is admissible then
{S˜p}p∈P is a partition of X. Note that if {Sp}p∈P is admissible then the P -family
defined by S∗ =  {Sq | q ≤ p} is monotone and admissible and the partitions
{S˜p}p∈P , {S˜∗}p∈P coincide.
We say that an admissible family {Sp}p∈P approximates a k-partition ν ∈ kX if ν = c ◦ S˜ where S˜ is identified with the function from X to P sending x ∈ X to the unique p ∈ P with x ∈ S˜p. For a countable k-poset (P, c) without infinite chains, let L(P, c) be the set of k-partitions approximated by admissible (equivalently, by monotone admissible) P -families. The difference hierarchy of k-partitions over L is by definition the family {L(P )}P∈Pe ; by BHk(L) we denote the collection {L(P ) | P ∈ Pk} of levels of this hierarchy. We consider also a smaller collection of classes
of k-partitions FBH (L) = {L(P ) | P ∈ F } defined by the k-forests. If we omit the condition p Sp = X in the definition of admissible family, we obtain the DH of partial k-partitions over L.
In [11,21] it was observed that levels of the DH are closely related to the h- preorder, namely for all countable k-posets P and Q without infinite chains P ≤ Q implies L(P ) ⊆ L(Q). Since the h-preorder of k-posets is far from being a well preorder, the DH of k-partitions defined by posets do not in general have properties one expects from a hierarchy. The DH of k-partitions defined by forests is in this respect better because (FBHk(L); ⊆) is a well poset. In [17,21] it was shown that over any L with σ-reduction property we have BHk(L) = FBHk(L), and hence the poset (BHk(L); ⊆) is a well preorder of rank ≤ ω1.
Let .i Pi = P0 H P1 H· · · be the join of a sequence P0, P1,... of k-posets. For a

k-forest F and i < k, let pi(F ) be the k-tree obtained from F by adjoining a new biggest element and assigning the label i to this element.
It is easy to see that for any topological space X and any nonzero countable
ordinal θ we have  {Σ0(P ) | P ∈ P˜k} ⊆ (Δ0	)k. The next result shows that in

θ
many cases we may improve this relation.

that Σ0 has the σ-reduction property and Δ0	=  {Dα(Σ0) | α < ω1}. Then

)k =  {Σ0(F ) | F ∈ F˜k}.

Proof. We need to show only the inclusion from left to right. We prove this even
for partial k-partitions. Let ν be a partial k-partition in (Δ0	)k. By Proposition
4.1 there is α < ω1 and a sequence {fβ}β<α witnessing that ν is a partial α-Σ0
k-partition. Moreover, by the proof of that proposition we way assume that any fβ is a constant function defined on a Σ0-set Aβ and taking some value iβ < k. Obviously, for any γ < α the sequence {fβ}β<γ witnesses that the restriction ν|Cγ
of ν to the set Cγ =  {Aβ | β < γ} is a partial γ-Σ0 k-partition.
We find F ∈ Fk with ν ∈ Σ0(F ) by induction on α. For α = 0, 1 the assertion is trivial. Let α = β + 1 > 1. By induction, there is G ∈ Fk and an admissible
family {Sp}p∈G of Σ0-sets that approximates ν|C . We set F = pi (G) and define
β
an admissible family {Rq}q∈F of Σ0-sets by Rr = Aβ (where r is the root of F ) and
Rp = Sp for p ∈ G. Then {Rq}q∈F approximates ν, hence ν ∈ Σ0(F ).
Finally, let α be a limit ordinal. By induction, for any γ < α there is Fγ ∈ F˜k
and an admissible family {Sγ}	of Σ0-sets that approximates ν|	. Let {A' }

be a reduct of
p p∈Fγ

and

Σ0-sets defined by Rp = A' ∩ Sp where γ is the unique ordinal with p ∈ Fγ. Then

)k =  {Σ0(P ) | P ∈ P˜k}in arbitrary topological space.

Another interesting open question is the non-collapse of the DH of partitions (for the forest-hierarchy this means that for all S, T ∈ T˜k, Σ0(S) ⊆ Σ0(T ) iff S ≤ T ).
In [22] we established the non-collapse of the forest-hierarchy over Σ0 in any Polish
space and in any reflective or 2-reflective ω-algebraic domain (as above, the last fact holds also for the ω-continuous domains). We guess that the non-collapse property holds also for any θ > 1 but have no proof at hand.
It is straightforward to get the effective analog of Theorem 5.1.

Conclusion
Good properties of the DH and its effective versions were obtained so far only for two natural classes of spaces: Polish spaces and ω-continuous domains.  To my

knowledge, these are the only natural classes of spaces for which natural notions of completeness and completion theorems are known. In this respect these classes are close to each other (though many other basic topological properties of Polish spaces and of ω-continuous domains are very different).
An interesting general open question is to identify broader natural classes of countably based T0-spaces with good descriptive set theory or find counterexam- ples clearly demonstrating that outside the two mentioned classes there is no good descriptive set theory.
