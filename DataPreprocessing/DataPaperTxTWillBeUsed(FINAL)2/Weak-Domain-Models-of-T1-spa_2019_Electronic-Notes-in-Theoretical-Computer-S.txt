Abstract
The main objective of this paper is to study some aspects of weak domains. We first show that every meet continuous weak domain is a domain. Then we prove that a dcpo P is exact iff the weakly way-below relation is the smallest approximating w-auxiliary relation. It is then shown that for each T1 space, Zhao and Xi’s dcpo model is a weak algebraic domain, and hence a weak domain. As a consequence, we have that a weak algebraic domain need not be well-filtered and that every T1 space has a weak domain model, which strengthens a result of Mashburn.

A poset model of a topological space X is a poset P such that Max(P ), the set of maximal elements of P , with the relative Scott topology, is homeomorphic to X [5]. Every space having a poset model must be T1. In [6], Martin proved that if a space is homeomorphic to the maximal point space of a continuous dcpo, then the space is Choquet complete. Thus not every T1 space has a domain model.
In 2002, Coecke and Martin [1] constructed an ordered set to model finite di- mensional quantum states, and it turns out that their model is not a domain, i.e., not continuous with respect to the way-below relation. However, this model is con- tinuous with respect to the weakly way-below relation. Using the weakly way-below relation, Mashburn [7] defined the weak domains and proved that every first count- able space has a weak domain model. In [8], Mashburn proved that every linearly ordered topological space is homeomorphic to an open dense subset of a weak do- main representable space, showing that a space with a weak domain model need not be Baire. Then Mashburn [7] raised the following problem:
Which topological spaces are weak domain representable?
In this paper, it was shown that meet continuity [4] plays a crucial role between weak domains and domains. Precisely, we prove that every meet continuous weak domain is a domain. In [11], Zhao and Xi proved that every T1 space X has a dcpo model (we will call it Xi-Zhao model of X). We show that the Xi-Zhao model of every T1 space is a weak algebraic domain (hence a weak domain). As a corollary, every T1 space has a weak domain model, strengthening Mashburn’s result in [7] (every first countable T1 space has a weak domain model) and answering one of Mashburn’s problems. Using the main result in [9], we also deduce that, unlike domains, the Scott space of a weak domain need not be well-filtered.
Preliminary
In this section, we review some basic notions and results used in this paper. For more details, please refer to [2,7,8].
For a poset P and A ⊆ P , let ↓A = {x ∈ P : x ≤ a for some a ∈ A} and
↑A = {x ∈ P : x ≥ a for some a ∈ A}. For x ∈ P , we write ↓x for ↓{x} and ↑x for ↑{x}. A subset A is called a lower set (resp., an upper set ) if A = ↓A (resp., A = ↑A). A nonempty subset D of P is directed if every two elements in D have an upper bound in D. P is called a directed complete poset, or dcpo for short, if for any directed subset of D ⊆ P ,  D exists in P .
A subset U of P is Scott open if (i) U = ↑U and (ii) for any directed subset D for which	D exists,	D ∈ U implies D ∩ U /= ∅. All Scott open subsets of P form a topology, and we call this topology the Scott topology on P and denote it by σ(P ). The space (P, σ(P )) is called the Scott space of P , and we denote it by ΣP . For two elements x and y in P , x is way-below y, denoted by x  y, if for any directed subset D of P for which	D exists, y ≤	D implies D ∩ ↑x /= ∅. We let
x = {y ∈ P : x  y} and x = {y ∈ P : y  x}. P is continuous, if for any x ∈ P ,

the set x is directed and x = W x. A continuous dcpo is also called a domain.
An element x in a poset P is called compact if x  x. The set of all compact
elements of P is denoted by K(P ). A poset P is algebraic, if for any x ∈ P , the set
K(P )∩ ↓x is directed and x = W K(P ) ∩ x.
way-below yW, denoted by x  w y, if for any directed subset D of P for which	D Definition 2.1 (Mashburn [7]) Let P be a poset and x, y ∈ P . Then x is weakly
If P is continuous, then the relations  w and  on P coincide.
Proposition 2.2 (Mashburn [7,8]) In a poset P, the following statements hold for all x, y, z ∈ P:
x  y ⇒ x  w y;
x  w y ⇒ x ≤ y;
x ≤ y  w z ⇒ x  w z;
⊥  w x whenever P has a smallest element T.
One property owned by  is that x  y ≤ z implies x  z. This property may not be true for  w. It is true for  w if and only if  w and  coincide, as Coecke and Martin pointed out in [1].

For x ∈ P , let
wx = {y ∈ P : x  w y} and
wx = {y ∈ P : y  w x}.

Definition 2.3 (Mashburn [7,8]) A poset P is called exact if for any x ∈ P , wx is
directed and W wx = x. P is a weak domain if P is an exact dcpo and the relation
  w is weakly increasing : for any x, y, z, u ∈ P , x  w y ≤ z  w u implies x  w z.
Proposition 2.4 A dcpo P is exact iff for each x ∈ P, there exists a directed subset
D of  wx such that W D = x.
Proof. We only prove the Sufficiency. Assume x ∈ P and there is a directed subset
D of  wx such that W D = x. TWo verify the directedness of  wx, let y1, y2 ∈  wx,
y2 ≤ d2. Since D is directed, there is d ∈ D such that d1, d2 ≤ d, so that y1, y2 ≤ d.

Note that d ∈  wx because D ⊆
wx. This implies  wx is directed. In addition,

since x = W D ≤ W
wx ≤ x, we have x = W wx. Hence, P is an exact dcpo.	2

Note that every domain is a weak domain because
x is a directed subset of wx

with W x = x.
Like the way-below relation on domains, the weakly way-below relation on do-
mains has the important interpolation property.
Theorem 2.5 (Mashburn [7, Theorem 3.6]) If P is a weak domain, then w is interpolative in P, that is, for any x, y ∈ P, x  w y implies the existence of z ∈ P such that x  w z  w y.

More relationships between domains and weak do- mains
In this section, we provide some more relationships among certain types of domains. We call a dcpo in which any two elements have an infimum a directed complete semilattice. A directed complete semilattice P is called meet continuous if for any
x ∈ P and any directed subset D of P , x ≤	D implies x =	{x ∧ d : d ∈ D}.
Lemma 3.1 If P is a meet continuous directed complete semilattice, then the rela- tions  w and  on P coincide.
Proof. Suppose a  wWb and D is a directed subset of P with b ≤ W D. Since P is
for some d0 ∈ D, and hence a  b. Trivially, we have that a  b implies a  w b.
Hence  w and  coincide.	2
As an immediate result of Lemma 3.1, we have the following result.
Proposition 3.2 A directed complete semilattice P is a domain if and only if it is a meet continuous weak domain.
In 2001, Kou, Liu and Luo extended the notion of meet continuity to the general dcpos [4]. A dcpo P is meet continuous if for any x ∈ P and any directed set D with x ≤ D, x ∈ clσ(↓D ∩ ↓x), where clσ is the closure operator for the Scott topology. A well-known result is that every domain is meet continuous.
It is natural to ask whether Proposition 3.2 holds for any dcpo. In the following, we will answer this question in the affirmative.
Lemma 3.3 If P is a meet continuous weak domain, then the relations  w and
  on P coincide.
Proof. Let y  w x. Assume that D is a directed subset of P such that x ≤  D. By Theorem 2.5, there exists z ∈ P such that y w z w x. Since P is meet continuous, it follows that z ∈ clσ(↓z ∩ ↓D), or equivalently ↓z = clσ(↓z ∩ ↓D).
Now for every ordinal α, we define a subset Aα of P inductively:
A0 := ↓z ∩ ↓D,
Aα := ↓ {W E : E is a directed subset of Aβ} , if α = β + 1 for some ordinal β, Aα :=  β<α Aα, if α is a limit ordinal.

Then clσ(A0) = {Aα : α is an ordinal}. Since the cardinality of clσ(A0) is less than that of the power set of P , there exists a smallest ordinal number γ such that Aγ = Aγ′ for all γj ≥ γ, and hence clσ(A0)=  α≤γ Aα = Aγ.
We note that
β < α implies Aβ ⊆ Aα;
for any α ≤ γ, Aα ⊆ ↓z because Aα ⊆ clσ(A0)= ↓z;

for any ordinal α, z ∈ Aα iff Aα = clσ(A0)= ↓z.
We assert that γ is not a limit ordinal. Otherwise, z ∈ Aγ =  α<γ Aα implies that z ∈ Aα0 for some α0 < γ, and hence Aα0 = clσ(A0)= Aγ, a contradiction.

We say that an ordinal α has F property if Aα ∩
wy ∩ ↓z /= ∅ implies y ∈ ↓D.

Now we prove that every ordinal has F property by transfinite induction.
If there exists u ∈ A0 with y  w u ≤ z, then y ≤ u ∈ ↓D and hence y ∈ ↓D. Thus 0 has F property.
Assume α has F property. Let u ∈ Aα+1 ∩ wy ∩ ↓z. Then there exists a
directed subset E of Aα such that u ≤ WWE. By Theorem 2.5, there exists v W∈ P
and hence there exists e ∈ E ⊆ Aα such that v ≤ e. Note that y  w v ≤ e ≤ z  w

implies y  w e. Now since e ∈ Aα ∩
y ∈ ↓D. Thus α +1 has F property.
wy ∩ ↓z and α has F property, it follows that

Assume α is a limit ordinal and β has F property for all β < α.  Let
u ∈ Aα ∩ wy ∩↓z. Since u ∈ Aα =  β<α Aβ, there exists β0 < α such that u ∈ Aβ0 .
Since β0 has F property and u ∈ Aβ0 ∩ wy ∩ ↓z, it follows that y ∈ ↓D. So α has
F property.
By transfinite induction, α has F property for all α ≤ γ. In particular, γ has F

property. Note that z ∈ Aγ ∩
wy ∩ ↓z /= ∅, so that y ∈ ↓D.

All above results together show that y  x. The converse implication is trivial.2
As a direct consequence of Lemma 3.3, the following result shows that meet continuity forces weak domains to domains.
Theorem 3.4 Every meet continuous weak domain is a domain.
Definition 3.5 A dcpo P is called a local domain (resp., a local algebraic domain) if for each x ∈ P , ↓x is a domain (resp., an algebraic domain).
A dcpo is called a local weak domain if for each x ∈ P , ↓x is a weak domain.
The following proposition is trivial since every element in a dcpo P is below some maximal point of P .
Proposition 3.6 A dcpo P is a local domain (resp., a local algebraic domain) iff for each a ∈ Max(P ), ↓a is a domain (resp., an algebraic domain).
In [3], Jung has proved the following result.
Theorem 3.7 [3, Corollary 1.7] (1) Local domains are exactly domains.
(2) Local algebraic domains are exactly algebraic domains.
By Proposition 3.6, Theorems 3.7, we have
Corollary 3.8 (1) A dcpo P is a domain iff ↓a is a domain for each a ∈ Max(P ).
(2) A dcpo P is an algebraic domain iff ↓a is an algebraic domain for each
a ∈ Max(P ).
The following result is trivial.

Lemma 3.9 Let P be a dcpo and x, y ∈ P. Then y  w x in P iff y  w x in ↓x.
By Lemma 3.9, we have
Corollary 3.10 A dcpo is a weak domain iff it is a local weak domain.
For subsets G and H of a dcpo P , G is way-below H, denoted by G  H, if for any directed set D,  D ∈ ↑H implies D ∩ ↑G /= ∅. A dcpo P is quasicontinuous if for any x ∈ P , the family
fin(x)= {↑F ⊆ P : F is finite and F  x}
is filtered and ↑x =	fin(x) (see [2, Definition III-3.2]). Note that every domain is a quasicontinuous domain. A dcpo P is quasialgebraic if for any x ∈ P , the family
comp(x)= {F ⊆ P : F is finite and F   F   x}
is filtered and ↑x = comp(x) (see [2, Definition III-3.23]). It is clear that every quasialgebraic domain is quasicontinuous and every algebraic domain is quasialge- braic.
The next two examples show that quasicontinuous domains need not be weak domains, and weak domains need not be quasicontinuous domains. In the following, the notation N means the set of natural numbers.
Example 3.11 Let P = {⟨n, i⟩ : n ∈ N,i = 0, 1} ∪ {T}. Define the order on P by the following rules:
⟨n, i⟩ ≤ ⟨m, j⟩ iff n ≤ m and i = j;
∀p ∈ P , p ≤ T.
Then P can be represented by Figure 1. It is easy to check that P is a quasicontin-

uous domain. However, it is not a weak domain because
w T = ∅.



Fig. 1. A quasicontinuous domain but not a weak domain

Example 3.12 A weak domain need not be a quasicontinuous domain. Let Q =
{⟨m, n⟩ : m, n ∈ N}∪ {⟨ω, n⟩ : n ∈ N} ∪ {T}. Define an order on Q by the following rules: ∀m, mj, n, nj ∈ N,
∀q ∈ Q, q ≤ T;

⟨ω, m⟩ ≤ ⟨ω, n⟩ iff m ≤ n;
⟨m, n⟩≤ ⟨ω, n⟩;
⟨m, n⟩ ≤ ⟨mj, nj⟩ iff m ≤ mj and n = nj.
The order on Q can be represented by Figure 2. We have the following facts:

(q1)
(q2)
(q3)
w T = Q \ {T};
w⟨ω, n⟩ = {⟨m, n⟩ : m ∈ N};
w⟨m, n⟩ = ↓⟨m, n⟩.

Thus, Q is a weak domain. But it is not quasicontinuous. Considering ⟨ω, 0⟩, for any finite subset F of Q, there exists n0 ∈ N such that x < ⟨ω, n0⟩ and x ¢ ⟨m, n0⟩ for all x ∈ F and m ∈ N. Note that ⟨ω, 0⟩ ≤ ⟨ω, n0⟩ =  {⟨m, n0⟩ : m ∈ N}, but
{⟨m, n0⟩ : m ∈ N}∩ ↑F = ∅. So F /  ⟨ω, 0⟩. This means fin(⟨ω, 0⟩)= ∅. Hence,
Q is not a quasicontinuous domain.

Fig. 2. A weak domain but not a quasicontinuous domain

A dcpo P is called a local quasicontinuous domain (resp., a local quasialgebraic domain) if for each x ∈ P , ↓x is a quasicontinuous domain (resp., a quasialgebraic domain).
Remark 3.13 (1) Every quasicontinuous domain is local quasicontinuous.
Observe that the weak domain (= ↓T) of Figure 2 is not quasicontinuous, thus is not local quasicontinuous. It follows that weak domains need not be a local quasicontinuous domains.
In [9], it was proved that every T1 space X has a local quasicontinuous domain model, denoted by Zh(X). An important property is that X is sober iff Zh(X) is sober. So if X is not sober, then Zh(X) cannot be quasicontinuous. Hence, there exists a local quasicontinuous domain which is not quasicontinuous.
Theorem 3.14 Every meet continuous local quasicontinuous domain is a domain.

Proof. Assume P is a meet continuous local quasicontinuous domain. Let x ∈ P . Then ↓x is a meet continuous quasicontinuous domain, so it is a domain. By 3.7, P is a domain.	2
By Theorem 3.7, Corollary 3.10, Examples 3.11, 3.12 and Remark 3.13, the relations among domains, local domains, quasicontinuous domains, local quasicon- tinuous domains, weak domains and local weak domains are shown in Figure 3.


Fig. 3. Relations among (local) domains, (local) quasicontinuous domains and (local) weak domains

Proposition 3.15 [2, Lemma III-2.10] If F is a ﬁnite subset of a meet continuous
dcpo P, then intσ(↑F ) ⊆  { x : x ∈ F}.
Lemma 3.16 Let P be a domain and let F be a ﬁnite subset of P with F  F.
Every minimal element in F is compact.
If F  x, then there exists y ∈ F ∩ K(P ) such that y  x.
Proof. (1) Let x be a minimal element in F . By F   F , F   x. Since P is a
domain, x ∈	F = intσ(↑F ). By Proposition 3.15, there exists y ∈ F such that
y  x. Then y = x because x is minimal in F . Thus, x  x.
(2) As x ∈ F if and only if there exists a minimal (compact) element y in F
such that y ≤ x. Then by (1), it is trivial.	2
Proposition 3.17 Every meet continuous quasialgebraic domain is an algebraic domain.
Proof. Suppose P is a meet continuous quasialgebraic domain. By [2, Theorem III-3.10], P is a domain. Let x ∈ P . By Lemma 3.16, for any F ∈ comp(x), there exists y ∈ F ∩ K(P ) such that y  x. Let GF = {y ∈ F ∩ K(P ) : y  x}. Since P is quasialgebraic, the family {↑GF : F ∈ comp(x)} is filtered. Then, by Rudin’s Lemma, there exists a directed set D ⊆  {GF : F ∈ comp(x)} such that D ∩ GF /= ø for all F ∈ comp(x).

If x A
D, then there exists F ∈ comp(x) such that W D W∈/
↑F , which implies

Note that D ⊆ ↓x ∩ K(P ) iWs directed with W D = x. Then one can deduce that
Theorem 3.18 Every meet continuous local quasialgebraic domain is a quasialge-
braic domain.
Proof. Assume P is a meet continuous local quasialgebraic domain. Let x ∈ P . Then ↓x is a meet continuous quasialgebraic domain, so by Proposition 3.17, it is an algebraic domain. By 3.7, P is an algebraic domain.	2

Locating the relation  w within the weakly auxiliary relations
In this section, we define a new auxiliary relation corresponding to the weakly way- below relation, and use it characterize exact dcpos.
Definition 4.1 A binary relation ≺ on a poset P is called a weakly auxiliary rela- tion, or w-auxiliary relation for short, if for all x, y, z ∈ P :
x ≺ y implies x ≤ y;
x ≤ y ≺ z implies x ≺ z;
⊥≺ x whenever the smallest element ⊥ exists in P .
The set of all w-auxiliary relations on P is denoted by WAux(P ).
Remark 4.2 (1) The only difference between w-auxiliary relations and auxiliary relations (see [2, Defintion I-1.11]) is that w-auxiliary relations may not be increasing: x ≺ y ≤ z may not imply x ≺ z.
Weakly way-below relations are w-auxiliary.
The set WAux(P ) is a poset relative to the containment of graphs as subsets of
P ×P . The largest element is the relation ≤ itself. If P has a smallest element
⊥, then WAux(P ) has a smallest element ≺0 given by x ≺0 y if and only if x = ⊥. Moreover, WAux(P ) is closed under arbitrary nonempty intersection in the powerset of P × P . Hence, WAux(P ) is a complete lattice whenever the smallest element of P exists.
For a poset P , we use Low(P ) to denote the set of all lower sets in P .
Proposition 4.3 Let P be a poset and Φ(P ) be the set of all mappings s : P −→
LowP satisfying s(x) ⊆ ↓x for all x ∈ P. Then the assignment
≺'→ s≺ = (x '→ {y : y ≺ x})
is a well-deﬁned isomorphism from WAux(P ) to Φ(P ), whose inverse sends every mapping s ∈ Φ(P ) to the relation ≺s given by
x ≺s y if and only if x ∈ s(y).
Proof. Let ≺ be a w-auxiliary relation on P . Then s≺(x) is a lower set by Definition
(ii) and is contained in ↓x by Definition 4.1 (i). Thus s≺ is in Φ(P ) and the

assignment ≺ '→ s≺ is clearly order-preserving.
Conversely, if s ∈ Φ(P ), then s(x) ⊆ ↓x implies that ≺s satisfies Definition 4.1
Furthermore, if x ≤ y ≺s z, then y ∈ s(z). Since s(z) is a lower set, it follows that x ∈ s(z), implying x ≺s z. Thus Definition 4.1 (ii) is satisfied. Condition (iii) of Definition 4.1 is immediate. Therefore, the assignment s '→≺s is well-defined, and it is obviously order-preserving.
Note that x ≺s≺ y if and only if x ∈ s≺(y) if and only if x ≺ y. In addition, s≺s (x) = {y ∈ P : y ≺s x} = {y ∈ P : y ∈ s(x)} = s(x). Therefore, the two assignments are inverse from each other.	2
Lemma 4.4 Let P be a dcpo and x ∈ P.
wx =  {I ∈ Id(P ): x = W I};
the assignment x '→ wx is a member of Φ(P ) deﬁned in Proposition 4.3;
for every ideal I ∈ Id(P ), the mapping mI : P −→ Low(P ) given by
m (x) := ⎧⎨ I,	if x = W I,

​
is in Φ(P );
wx =  Φ(P ){mI (x): I ∈ Id(P )}.
⎩ ↓x, otherwise

Proof. We only check (4), as (1)-(3) are obvious. In fact,
 Φ(P ){mI (x): I ∈ Id(P )}
=  {mI (x): I ∈ Id(P )}
=  {mI (x): I ∈ Id(P ),x = W I}∩  {mI (x): I ∈ Id(P ),x /= W I}
=  {I ∈ Id(P ): I ∈ Id(P ),x = W I}∩ ↓x
= wx,
completing the proof.	2
Definition 4.5 A w-auxiliary relation ≺ on a dcpo P is approximating if for each
x in P , the set s≺(x)= {y ∈ P : y ≺ x} is directed and x =	s≺(x).
Lemma 4.6 Let P be a dcpo and I ∈ Id(P ). Then the relation ≺I deﬁned below is an approximating w-auxiliary relation:
∀x, y ∈ P, y ≺I x ⇔ y ∈ mI (x).
Proof. It is easy to check that ≺I defined above is a w-auxiliary relation. We now check that it is approximating. Let x ∈ P . There are two cases:
If x = W I, then W{y ∈ P : y ≺I x} = W mI (x)= W I = x.
If x /= W I, then W{y ∈ P : y ≺I x} = W mI (x)= W ↓ x = x.

Thus, for all x ∈ P , W{y ∈ P : y ≺I x} = x, hence ≺I is approximating.    2
Proposition 4.7 For a dcpo P, the weakly way-below relation on P is the inter-
section of all the approximating w-auxiliary relations on P.
Proof. Suppose x  w y and ≺∈ WAux(P ) is approximating. Since {z ∈ P : z ≺ y} is directed and y = {z ∈ P : z ≺ y}, there exists z ∈ P such that x ≤ z ≺ y, implying x ≺ y. Therefore,  w is contained in ≺.
Additionally, by Lemma 4.6, we have
wx =  {mI (x): I ∈ Id(P )}⊇  {s≺(x) :≺ is approximating},
where s≺(x) = {y ∈ P : y ≺ x}. Therefore, the relation  w is the intersection of all approximating w-auxiliary relations on P .	2
Theorem 4.8 For a dcpo P, the following statements are equivalent:
P is exact.
The relation  w is the smallest approximating w-auxiliary relation on P.
There is a smallest approximating w-auxiliary relation on P.
Weak domain models of T1 spaces
Now let’s go back to Mashburn’s question [7] as indicated in the introduction:
Which topological spaces have weak domain models?
In this section, we will show that every T1 space has a weak domain model, which answers the above question. The crucial tool that we make use of is the Xi-Zhao model, which was introduced by Dongsheng Zhao and Xiaoyong Xi [11].
In [10], Zhao proved that every T1 space X has a bounded complete algebraic poset model. This model is constructed by using the set of all filtered families of
poset  P ,  Xi  and  Zhao  [11]  constructed  a  dcpo  P^  as: open sets of X with a nonempty intersection. For each bounded complete algebraic
P^ = {(x, d): x ∈ P, d ∈ Max(P ) and x ≤P d},
where ≤P is the partial order on P , and (x, d) ≤ (y, e) in P^ iff either d = e
and x ≤P y, or y = e and x ≤P e. They proved that Max(P ) and Max(P ) are
homeomorphic, showing that every T1 space has a dcpo model (the Xi-Zhao model).
Definition 5.1 Let P be a poset.
An element x ∈ P is called weakly compact, if x  w x. Denote by Kw(P ) the set of all weakly compact elements.
P is called a weak algebraic poset, if  w is weakly increasing and for any x ∈ P ,
the set Kw(P ) ∩ wx is directed and x = W Kw(P ) ∩ wx.
A weak algebraic dcpo is also called a weak algebraic domain.
Note that every weak algebraic domain is a weak domain and that every meet continuous weak algebraic dcpo is algebraic by Lemma 3.3.

Next, we will show that the Xi-Zhao model constructed for each T1 space is a weak algebraic domain (and hence a weak domain).
Remark 5.2 The following facts on the dcpo P constructed from a bounded com- plete algebraic poset P will be used subsequently.
If D is a directed subset of P and it does not have a largest element, then there exists d ∈ Max(P ) and a directed subset {xi : i ∈ I} of P such that D = {(xi, d): i ∈ I}, and in this case  D = ( P {xi : i ∈ I}, d).
The set of maximal points of P^ equals {(d, d): d ∈ Max(P )}.
Lemma 5.3 Let P be a weak algebraic poset P and (x, d) ∈ P .
x ∈ Kw(P ) if and only if (x, d) ∈ Kw(P );
if x ∈/ Kw(P ), then (y, e)  w (x, d) if and only if y  w x and d = e;
for any (y, e) ∈ P, (x, d)  w (y, e) implies x  w y.
Proof. (1) Suppose that x  w x and D is a directed subset of P with (x, d)=  D. If (x, d) ∈/ D, then, by Remark 5.2, there is a directed subset {xi : i ∈ I} of P such that D = {(xi, d): i ∈ I} and  D = ( P {xi : i ∈ I}, d). Thus x = P {xi : i ∈ I}. Since x  w x, it follows that x ≤P xi0 for some i0 ∈ I. This means (x, d) ≤ (xi0 , d) ∈ D, and hence (x, d)  w (x, d). The other direction, (x, d)  w (x, d) implies x  w x, is trivial.

Suppose that (y, e)  w (x, d). First, let D = Kw(P ) ∩
wx. By the assump-

poset, D Wis directed aWnd	P D = x. Thus, the set {(z, d): z ∈ D} is directed and tion that x ∈/ Kw(P ), we have x ∈/ D, and hence d ∈/ D. As P is a weak algebraic
such that (y, e) ≤ (z0, d). Thus e = d because z0 /= d. Now suppose that S be a directed subset of P with x =  P S. Then {(z, d) : z ∈ S} is a directed subset of P and (x, d)=  {(z, d): z ∈ S}. By (y, e)  w (x, d), there exists z0 ∈ S such that (y, e)= (y, d) ≤P (z0, d). Thus y ≤P z0. Hence, y  w x.
The converse is straightforward by using (i) in Remark 5.2.
It is immediate by using (i) in Remark 5.2.	2
Lemma 5.4 Let P be an algebraic poset.
If x  w y ≤P z on P, then x  w z.
If (x, d)  w (y, e) ≤ (u, f )  w (v, g) on P^, then (x, d)  w (u, f ).
Proof. (1) Suppose that D is a directed subset of P such that z = WP D. As P is
and u ≤P y. Note that u  u ≤P z =	P D, and hence there exists v ∈ D such
that u ≤P v, implying x ≤P v. Therefore x  w z.
(2) First, by Lemma 5.3 (3), x  w y ≤P u. By (1), x  w u. We consider the following cases:
Case 1: u ∈ Kw(P ).

By Lemma 5.3 (1), (u, f )  w (u, f ). By (x, d) ≤ (u, f ), we have (x, d)  w
(u, f ) by Proposition 2.2 (3).
Case 2: u = f .
In this case, (u, f ) = (f, f ) ∈ Max(P ), and hence (v, g) = (u, f ), (u, f )  w
(u, f ). By Proposition 2.2 (3), we have (x, d)  w (u, f ).
Case 3: x = d or y = e.
A similar argument of Case 2 applies.
Case 4: u ∈/ Kw(P ), u /= f , y /= e and x /= d.
By (x, d) ≤ (y, e) ≤ (u, f ), we have d = e = f . By the fact that x  w u and Lemma 5.3 (2), (x, d)  w (u, f ).

As a corollary of Lemmas 5.3, 5.4, we obtain the following.
Corollary 5.5 For an algebraic poset P, P^ is a weak algebraic domain.
Applying Corollary 5.5 to Xi-Zhao model for T1 space, we obtain our main result.
Theorem 5.6 Every T1 topological space has a weak algebraic domain model.
Conclusion
Let’s note that the analogue of Figure 3 for the algebraic case hold too, that is,

algebraic domain e local algebraic domain

⇒ ⎧⎨
⎩
local weak algebraic domain e weak algebraic domain quasialgebraic domain ⇒ local quasialgebraic domain.

All above notions coincide in a meet continuous dcpo.
A dcpo P is called well-ﬁltered if its Scott space is well-filtered (see [2] for the definition of well-filteredness). In [9], it was proved that a T1 space X is well-filtered iff its Xi-Zhao model is well-filtered. As was pointed out in [9], there exists a T1 space that is not well-filtered, thus its Xi-Zhao model is a weak domain (even a weak algebraic domain) that is not well-filtered.
In [7], Mashburn proved that every first countable space has a weak domain model. Our Theorem 5.6 shows that the condition “first countable” in Msh- burn’s result is surplus. Now we can say that a space has a weak domain model iff it is a T1 space, answering Mashburn’s problem, as indicated in the introduction.
By Theorem 3.4, we prove that every meet continuous weak domain is a do- main. However, the following question is still unknown:
Is a meet continuous exact dcpo a domain?
