Abstract
A gap-[k]-vertex-labelling of a simple graph G = (V, E) is a pair (π, cπ ) in which π : V (G) → {1, 2,..., k} is an assignment of labels to the vertices of G and cπ : V (G) → {0, 1,..., k} is a proper vertex-colouring of G such that, for every v ∈ V (G) of degree at least two, cπ (v) is induced by the largest difference, i.e. the largest gap, between the labels of its neighbours (cases where d(v) = 1 and d(v) = 0 are treated separately). Introduced in 2013 by A. Dehghan et al. [3], they show that deciding whether a bipartite graph admits
a gap-[2]-vertex-labelling is NP-complete and question the computational complexity of deciding whether cubic bipartite graphs admit such a labelling. In this work, we advance the study of the computational complexity for this class, proving that this problem remains NP-complete even when restricted to subcubic bipartite graphs.
Keywords: Gap-labellings, proper labellings, graph labellings.


Introduction
Let G be a simple graph with vertex set V (G) and edge set E(G). The elements of G are its vertices and its edges. The degree and the neighbourhood of a vertex v ∈ V (G) are respectively denoted by d(v) and N (v), and the maximum degree of G is denoted by Δ(G). A proper colouring of G is an assignment c : V (G) → C, where C denotes a set of colours, such that for every edge uv ∈ E(G), c(u) /= c(v). A proper vertex-labelling is a pair (π, cπ) where π : V (G) → {1, 2,..., k} is an assignment of labels to the vertices of G and cπ is a proper colouring of G, induced

In (a), a gap-[3]-vertex-labelling of the Petersen Graph; in (b), a gap-[2]-vertex-labelling of a subcubic bipartite graph inducing a 3-colouring; and, in (c), the Heawood Graph, which does not admit a gap-[2]-vertex-labelling. For every vertex, the number inside the box to its lower right corner corresponds to its assigned label
by π through some mathematical function over the set of labelled elements. In this work, we discuss proper vertex-labellings induced by gaps of labels.
Most authors trace the origins of proper graph labellings to 1967, when A. Rosa [7] introduced β-valuations. Since then, many different labellings have been studied. Each one varies the elements to which the labels are assigned and how the colouring is induced. In fact, there are several interesting surveys on the topic [4,6,10]. Concerning gap-labellings, they were first introduced as a vertex- distinguishing edge-labelling in 2012 by M. Tahraoui et al. [8], as a generalization of set and multiset labellings [1]. The vertex-labelling variant we consider in this text is defined as follows.
A gap-[k]-vertex-labelling of a graph G is a proper vertex-labelling of G over the set {1, 2,..., k} such that cπ : V (G) → {0, 1,..., k} is a proper colouring of G in which, for every vertex v ∈ V (G): (i) cπ(v) = 1 if d(v) = 0; (ii) cπ(v) = π(u), u ∈ N (v), if d(v) = 1; and (iii) cπ(v) = maxu∈N (v){π(u)} − minu∈N (v){π(u)} otherwise. Figures 1(a) and 1(b) exemplify gap-[k]-vertex-labellings using k = 3 and k = 2 labels, respectively. Observe in the latter that a gap-[k]-vertex-labelling may induce a proper (k+1)-colouring if there exists degree-one vertices in the graph.
Gap-[k]-vertex-labellings were introduced by A. Dehghan et al. [3] in 2013. In their article, the authors investigated both the computational complexity of decision problems associated with the gap-[k]-vertex-labelling of some families of graphs, as well as the least k for which some graphs admit such a labelling. They also show that deciding whether a given graph admits a gap-[k]-vertex-labelling is NP-complete for
k ≥ 3.
For the case k = 2, Dehghan et al. show that the problem remains NP-complete for 3-colourable and for bipartite graphs, but if the graph is bipartite and planar, then the problem can be solved in polynomial time. They also show that every r-
regular bipartite graph, with r ≥ 4, admits a gap-[2]-vertex-labelling, and question whether this is also true for cubic bipartite graphs. The dichotomy surrounding bipartite graphs was further investigated by A. Dehghan in 2016 [2]. The author showed that deciding whether a planar bipartite graph G admits a gap-[k]-vertex-

labelling such that cπ is a proper 2-colouring of G is also an NP-complete problem. Recently, C. A. Weffort-Santos [9] investigated the gap-[k]-vertex-labelling of some classical families of graphs; of particular interest to this work, we cite cycles and
unicyclic graphs. For these classes, the author characterized which graphs admit gap-[2]-vertex-labellings. These results imply that the gap-[2]-vertex-labelling deci- sion problem can be solved in linear time for these particular instances.
Although the literature presents “positive” polynomial-time solvability results for r-regular bipartite graphs for r = 2 and r ≥ 4, the computational complexity for gap-[2]-vertex-labellings of 3-regular (i.e. cubic) bipartite graphs, originally pro- posed by Dehghan et al. [3] in 2013, remains unknown. In this work, we advance the computational complexity analysis on bipartite graphs, showing that the problem remains NP-complete when restricted to the family of subcubic bipartite graphs.
Our main results are presented in Theorem 1.1 and Corollary 1.2 and are proved in
the next section. In order to simplify the notation, we denote by G2vl the problem of deciding whether a graph admits a gap-[2]-vertex-labelling.
Theorem 1.1 Restricted to subcubic bipartite graphs, G2vl is NP-complete.  2
Corollary 1.2 G2vl remains NP-complete when restricted to the family of subcu-
bic bipartite graphs with minimum degree 2.	2

Proof of Theorem 1.1
Given a graph G = (V, E), the Monochromatic Triangle (MT) problem ques- tions if there exists a partition of E into two disjoint sets E1, E2 such that neither G1 = (V, E1) nor G2 = (V, E2) contains a triangle. This problem was proved to be NP-complete by Burr in 1976 (although this result was only published by Garey &
Johnson in 1979 [5]). It can also be stated as an edge-colouring problem, where the
question is whether G admits a {red, blue}-edge-colouring such that every triangle in G, i.e. a subgraph of G isomorphic to complete graph K3, has at least one red
edge and one blue edge. For an instance G of Monochromatic Triangle, we
denote by T = (t1, t2,..., tp) an (arbitrary but fixed) ordering of all the p triangles in G. Also, we abuse notation to say that ti = {ex, ey, ez} is the triangle of G induced by edges ex, ey and ez of E(G).
We prove Theorem 1.1 by reducing Monochromatic Triangle to G2vl in

polynomial time. Equivalently, given an instance G of
Monochromatic
Tri-

angle, we construct a subcubic bipartite graph Gj such that G admits a 2-edge- colouring with no monochromatic triangles if and only if Gj admits a gap-[2]-vertex- labelling. The reduction is accomplished with the aid of two gadgets: a triangle gadget and a negation gadget.
The first, denoted by GΔ, is an auxiliary simple bipartite graph with 19 vertices, 20 edges and is described as follows. For a triangle ti = {ex, ey, ez}, GΔ has: a vertex u that represents ti ∈ G in Gj; two adjacent vertices vj and wj for each edge ej in ti; and a path P12, with V (P12)= {q0,..., q11}. We also link u to every vj and add edges wxq0, wyq4 and wzq8. Fig. 2(a) illustrates the triangle gadget for a triangle

t3 = {e1, e4, e7}. Note in the image that we index all of the gadget’s vertices with a superscript i, as well as the name GΔ, with a matching subscript. This is done so as to bind the vertices of triangle gadget GΔ to the corresponding triangle ti of G. We remark that GΔ is bipartite since it does not contain any odd cycles. Furthermore, since no vertex has degree greater than 3, GΔ is subcubic.

The negation gadget Gч
is used to connect vertices vi
and wj , belonging to

triangle gadgets GΔ and GΔ (not necessarily distinct). It is an auxiliary simple
i	j
bipartite graph obtained by removing an edge e from the Heawood Graph, depicted
in Fig. 1(c), and linking two new vertices, vin and w, to the ends of e. Let H be the Heawood Graph, with V (H)= {s0,..., s13} and e = s0s9. In the proof, we also refer to vertex s9 as vout. The construction of Gч yields a subcubic bipartite graph
with 16 vertices and 22 edges, which is illustrated in Fig. 2(b). Vertices vi and wj
are identified with vin and w from Gч , respectively. Note that, upon performing

this operation, vi
and wj
in the corresponding triangle gadgets have degree 3.

We are now ready to show the reduction, which will be exemplified for graph G
presented in Fig. 3(a). For every ti ∈T , ti = {ex, ey, ez}, add a new triangle gadget
GΔ to Gj. For every 1 ≤ i ≤ p − 1, add edge qi qi+1 to Gj. Also, add a copy of

i
cycle C6, V (C6)= {c0,..., c5}, and edge c0q1.

Next, let px denote the number of triangles to which an edge ex ∈ E(G) belongs to; note that px ≤ p. Then, each ex has px different triangle gadgets GΔ in Gj, each of which has its own pair of vertices vx and wx. Now, let tx denote the j-th triangle that contains ex in T . For instance, consider edge e9 from graph G in Fig. 3(a), which belongs to p9 = 2 triangles: t3 and t4. Then, t9 is the first triangle in T containing e9, namely t3; analogously, t9 is the second triangle containing e9, i.e.

t4.
In order to complete our reduction, we refer to vertices vi

and wi

belonging

to triangle tx as vx,l and wx,l, respectively. For example, v5,3 is vertex vi in GΔ
l	5	i
corresponding to the third triangle in T to contain edge e5, namely t3. Then,

connect vertices vx,j and wx,j+1 cyclically using negation gadget Gч
, following

the indices of triangles tx in T . This procedure — and the resulting graph Gj — are illustrated in Fig. 3(b). We draw the reader’s attention to edge e5, which belongs to three triangles t1, t2 and t3. Thus, vertices v5,1, w5,2 are connected with the negation

ч
5,(1,2)
, vertices v5,2 and w5,3, with Gч
and v5,3 and w5,1, with Gч	.

Note that if an edge ex belongs to a single triangle ti in G, then vi and wi
are

in the same triangle gadget GΔ, and are connected with negation gadget Gч
i	x,(i,i)
as exemplified by edges e1, e2, e3, e6, e7, e8 and e9 in the image. This completes the
construction of graph Gj, a subcubic bipartite instance of G2vl. We remark that the reduction is accomplished in polynomial time on the size of the input graph G since p = O(n3).
The structures used in the construction of Gj have important properties that are essential to the reduction and, consequently, to the proof of our main result. We list these properties below and refer the reader to Weffort-Santos’ Master’s Thesis for their detailed proofs [9].

Proposition 2.1 Let GΔ
be a triangle gadget. If GΔ
admits a gap-[2]-vertex-

labelling (π, cπ) with cπ(ui)= 1, then π(qi )= π(qi )= π(qi ).

Proof. Let GΔ
be a triangle gadget, and suppose GΔ
admits a gap-[2]-vertex-

labelling such that cπ(ui) = 1. Since the gadget is bipartite and every vertex v
in V (GΔ) \ {qi } has d(v) ≥ 2, the only possible colours induced in v by π are 0
i	11
and 1. Now, every vertex qi ∈ V (GΔ), l odd, is in the same part as vertex u in
l	i
any bipartition of GΔ. Thus, for every vertex qi, l ≤ 9, cπ(qi) = cπ(ui) = 1, as
i	l	l
illustrated in Fig. 4.
Let a ∈ {1, 2} be the label assigned to qi . Then, since cπ(qi )=1 and N (qi )= 
0	1	1
{qi , qi }, we conclude that {π(qi ), π(qi )} = {1, 2} and, consequently, that π(qi )= b,
0  2	0	2	2
b ∈ {1, 2}\ {a}. Analogously, consider vertex qi and, observing that cπ(qi )=1 and
3	3
N (qi ) = {qi , qi }, we conclude that π(qi ) = a = π(qi ). By a similar reasoning, we
3	2  4	4	0
conclude that the same holds for vertex qi , and the result follows.	2

Proposition 2.2 Let Gj be a subcubic bipartite graph with Gч ⊆ Gj and d(vin)= 

d(wj )= 3. If Gj admits a gap-[2]-vertex-labelling (π, c
) such that c (v
)= 0, then

Proof (Sketch) Let Gj, Gч
i,j
be as stated in the hypothesis. Suppose Gj admits

a gap-[2]-vertex-labelling such that cπ(vin) = 0. Note that cπ(v) ∈ {0, 1} for every v ∈ V (Gч ) since dG′ (v) = 3. Also, since s0 is adjacent to vin, we conclude that cπ(s0) = 1. Therefore, cπ(sl)= (l +1) mod 2 for every sl in the gadget. This implies that π(si)= π(sj) for every i, j even. The idea of the proof is to verify all possible label assignments to odd-indexed vertices sl that induce colouring cπ.
Let {a, b} = {1, 2}. We begin by considering the label assignments to some neighbours of s0, supposing a = π(s1) /= π(s13) as illustrated in Fig. 5; note that this labelling induces cπ(s0) = 1 without considering the label assigned to vin. Now, suppose π(s3) = b. Since s3, s13 ∈ N (s4) and π(s3) = π(s13) = b, we conclude that π(s5) = a. Then, since s1, s5 ∈ N (s6), π(s7) = b. Analogously, we have s7, s13 ∈ N (s12) which implies π(s11)= a. The only remaining odd-indexed vertex to be labelled is s9 = vout. However, if π(vout)= a, then π(vout)= π(s5)= π(s11) which induces cπ(s10) = 0, contradicting the hypothesis. This allows us to conclude that our last assumption, i.e., π(s3)= b /= π(s1), is incorrect.
By attempting π(s3) = π(s1) and following the same reasoning, we arrive at a similar contradiction, forcing us to backtrack to our first assumption and conclude that π(s1)= π(s13) in any such gap-[2]-vertex-labelling of Gj. Finally, we suppose π(vin)= π(vout) and, with the knowledge that π(s1)= π(s13), we need only verify the two possible label assignments for vertex s3 and how they affect the induced colouring. Since both labellings arrive at a contradiction, the result follows.   2
Proposition 2.3 Let ex be an edge of G that belongs to px ≥ 2 triangles and
x the j-th triangle in f that contains ex. If Gj admits a gap-[2]-vertex-labelling

(π, cπ), then, for every pair of triangle gadgets GΔ , GΔ
representing consecutive

triangles tx, tx

Proof (Sketch) Let G, Gj, (π, cπ) and ex be as stated in the hypothesis. Now, consider the px triangle gadgets, GΔ , which have vertices vx,j corresponding to edges ex ∈ tj. Then, every vertex vx,j is connected to wx,j+1 through the use of a negation gadget, and vertex wx,j, to vx,j—1. Also, recall that every vertex wx,j is

adjacent to vertices vout, vx,j and some vertex qx,j, with l ≡ 0 (mod 4); furthermore, every qx,j is assigned the same label a ∈ {1, 2} by Proposition 2.1.
Suppose that there exist vertices vx,j and vx,j+1 for which {π(vx,j), π(vx,j+1)} =
{a, b}. Adjust notation so that π(vx,j) = b. By Proposition 2.2, b = π(vx,j) = π(vin) /= π(vout) for vout connecting vx,j and wx,j+1. Therefore, every vertex in N (wx,j+1) has been assigned the same label a, which induces cπ(wx,j+1)= 0. This is a contradiction since wx,j+1 is adjacent to vx,j+1, whose induced colour is 0 by hypothesis. We conclude that in a gap-[2]-vertex-labelling of Gj, every vx,j corresponding to an edge ex ∈ E(G) has received the same label, and the result follows.	2

Proposition 2.4 Let C6 ⊆ Gj as constructed in the reduction. If Gj admits a gap-
[2]-vertex-labelling (π, cπ), then π(c3)= a and π(c1)= π(c5)= b, {a, b} = {1, 2}.
Proof. Let Gj as stated in the hypothesis and suppose Gj admits a gap-[2]-vertex- labelling (π, cπ). We prove the result by contradiction. Suppose cπ(c3) = 1. This implies that π(c4) /= π(c2). By the symmetry of the cycle, we assume, without loss of generality, that π(c2) = 1.  This implies that π(c0) = 2 since cπ(c1) =
1. Analogously, considering N (c5), we conclude that π(c4) = 1, a contradiction. Therefore, cπ(c3) = 0, which implies that vertices c0, c2 and c4 all have induced colour 1. By letting π(c3)= a, for a ∈ {1, 2}, we conclude that π(c1)= π(c5)= b,

In order to prove that
Monochromatic
Triangle ≤p
G2vl
for subcubic

bipartite graphs, we prove the following claims.
Claim 2.5 If G admits an edge-colouring c : E(G) → {red, blue} such that no triangle is monochromatic, then Gj admits a gap-[2]-vertex-labelling.
Proof (Sketch) Let G, Gj as stated and suppose G admits a {red, blue}-edge- colouring c without monochromatic triangles. Also, let {A, B} be the bipartition of

Gj such that vertices vi
∈ A. Figures 2 and 3 exemplify vertices in parts A and B

as coloured in white and black, respectively.
Define a labelling π : V (G) → {1, 2} of G as follows. First, assign label 1 to every

vertex in part B. Now, consider the vertices in part A. For every vertex vi
∈ GΔ

(corresponding to edge ex ∈ E(G)), assign π(vx)=1 if c(ex) = red, and π(vx)= 2, otherwise. For negation gadgets Gч , assign labels: (a, b, b, b, a, a, a) to vertices
(s1, s3,..., s13), with b = π(vi ) and a ∈ {1, 2}\ {b}. For vertices qi ∈ P12 ⊆ GΔ,
x	l	i
let π(qi) = 1 if l ≡ 0 (mod 4) and π(qi) = 2 if l ≡ 2 (mod 4). Finally, assign
l	l
π(c1)= π(c5)=2 and π(c3) = 1. Define colouring cπ as usual.
In order to prove that (π, cπ) is a gap-[2]-vertex-labelling of Gj, it suffices to show that cπ is a proper vertex-colouring of Gj. First, since every vertex in part B received the same label and Gj is connected, every vertex v ∈ A has induced colour cπ(v) = 0. Thus, it remains to consider the induced colours of vertices in B. It is possible to inspect the induced colourings of cycle C6, paths P12 ⊆ GΔ and

negation gadgets Gч
to observe that colours 0 and 1 alternate in the vertices in these

structures (with the exception of vertex qp
in GΔ, whose colour is cπ
(qp ) ∈ {1, 2}).

Furthermore, by properties 2.2 and 2.3, every vertex wi
∈ GΔ has (at least) two

neighbours, namely vx and vout ∈ V (Gч), with labels π(vx) /= π(vout). Therefore,
i	i
cπ(wi )= 1.
To complete the proof, note that, since every triangle in G is not mono- chromatic, the edges of ti = {ex, ey, ez} are coloured such that {c(ex), c(ey), c(ez)} = {red, blue}. This implies that {π(vi ), π(vi ), π(vi )} = {1, 2} in every tri-
x	y	z
angle gadget GΔ ∈ Gj which, in turn, induces cπ(ui) = 1. We conclude that cπ is a

proper colouring of G, and the result follows.	2
Claim 2.6 If Gj admits a gap-[2]-vertex-labelling, then G admits an edge-colouring
c : E(G) → {red, blue} such that no triangle is monochromatic.
Proof (Sketch) Let Gj, (π, cπ) as stated in the hypothesis and let {A, B} be a
bipartition of V (Gj) with vi ∈ A. By Proposition 2.4, cycle C6 ⊆ Gj has a unique
gap-[2]-vertex-labelling which, in turn, defines the induced colour of every vertex in Gj with degree at least two: vertices in A have induced colour 0 and vertices in B \ {qp }, colour 1.
Now, since ui ∈ GΔ belongs to B, we know that cπ(ui) = 1. Moreover, since
N (ui) = {vi , vi , vi }, we have {π(vi ), π(vi ), π(vi )} = {1, 2}. Then, define a {red,
x	y	z	x	y	z
blue}-edge-colouring of G as follows.  For every edge ex, assign c(ex) = red if

π(vx) = 1 and c(ex) = blue, otherwise.  By Proposition 2.3, every vi
receives

the same label and, therefore, no edge ex is assigned two colours. Thus, we have
{c(ex), c(ey), c(ez)} = {red, blue} in every triangle ti = {ex, ey, ez}, and every ti has at least one edge coloured with red and one with blue.	2
By combining claims 2.5 and 2.6, we conclude that MT ≤p G2vl (restricted to subcubic graphs), completing the proof of Theorem 1.1.
Now, consider the following modification to the previously described reduction.
Remove vertices qp, qp  and qp  from GΔ, i.e. the last three vertices in path P
9	10	11	p	12
in the last triangle gadget of Gj according to f . Call the resulting graph Gjj.
Note that this graph is subcubic having δ(Gjj) = 2. However, this modification to the constructed graph does not alter any of the properties of Gj, used to prove Theorem 1.1. Therefore, Corollary 1.2, below, holds.
Corollary 1.2 G2vl remains NP-complete when restricted to the family of subcu-
bic bipartite graphs with minimum degree 2.	2

Concluding remarks and open problems
The gap-[k]-vertex-labelling problem is fairly recent in the field of graph labellings. It is currently being studied under both the computational complexity and algorith- mic points of view. In the former, the problem has been proven to be NP-complete
for graphs in general when k ≥ 3. The latter approach has shown that, for certain
families of graphs (e.g. cycles, trees, crowns, wheels, unicyclic graphs and some families of snarks), it is possible to decide if they admit such a labelling in linear time. Moreover, there are known results on optimal gap-[k]-vertex-labellings for these families, i.e. labellings using the least number k of labels so as to induce a proper colouring of the graph. There have also been discoveries of classes of graphs that do not admit any gap-[k]-vertex-labelling for any k ∈ N, such as complete graphs of order n ≥ 4 and some powers of paths and cycles.
In particular, for k = 2, the family of bipartite graphs has proven to be quite challenging. It is known that deciding whether a bipartite graph admits a gap-[2]- vertex-labelling is NP-complete in general, but can be solved in polynomial time for

some subfamilies, such as planar bipartite and r-regular graphs with r ≥ 4. Our main result states that the problem remains NP-complete even when restricted to the families of subcubic bipartite graphs. Furthermore, if the minimum degree of
these graphs is two, the problem remains NP-complete. As a consequence, the ex- istence (or lack thereof) of degree-one vertices does not seem to facilitate deciding whether subcubic bipartite graphs admit gap-[2]-vertex-labellings. This result con-
trasts with known results for gap-vertex-labelable graphs since, in many cases, the presence of degree-one vertices helps the gap-[k]-vertex-labelling of certain graphs, e.g., every bipartite crown admits a gap-[2]-vertex-labelling whereas this is not the case for every even-length cycle.
In conclusion, we raise the following questions. Why do vertices of degree one
have (apparently) no impact on the hardness of G2vl? Furthermore, although
the problem remains NP-complete for subcubic bipartite graphs, can the structural properties of cubic graphs be used to decide if and when these graphs admit gap- [2]-vertex-labellings?
