Co(II), Pb(II), Hg(II) and Cd(II) complexes of the 3-(2-(4-(dimethylamino)benzylidene)hydrazinyl)- 3-oxo-N-(thiazol-2-yl)propanamide (H2L) were synthesized. The prepared compounds were interpreted by elemental analysis: C, H, N, M, Cl; physical measurements as molar conduc- tance; and magnetic susceptibility spectroscopic techniques as IR, UV–visible, 1H NMR, MS spectra. The computational studying was estimated to approve the geometry of the iso- lated solid compounds. Also, Pb(II) and Cd(II) were separated using a simple, rapid and inexpensive quantitative flotation method prior to their determinations using atomic ab- sorption spectrophotometric (AAS). The main parameters influencing the flotation process were examined (ca. initial pH, metal ion, surfactant and ligand concentrations, presence of foreign ions, and temperature). Furthermore, the biological activity (antimicrobial, anti- oxidant and cytotoxic) of the investigated compounds was tested.

Introduction

Heterocyclic systems containing thiazole moiety are very in- teresting compounds where sulfur drugs, biocides, fungicides, dyes and chemical reaction accelerators are synthesized from 2-aminothiazoles. Also, this moiety is a very good complexing agent that provides several probable binding sites for compl- exation of diverse metal ions. Schiff-bases of 2-amino thiazoles
and their transition metal complexes play an important role in pharmaceutical chemistry along with co-ordination chem- istry [1–5].
Furthermore, Schiff-bases as selective metal extracting agents were utilized in analytical chemistry in addition to spec- troscopic determination of some transition metal ions, where many separation/preconcentration techniques (ion-flotation, ion-selective electrode, solid phase extraction, co-precipitation, column extraction, cloud point extraction and liquid–liquid

extraction) were stated to determine trace metal [6–10]. Ion- flotation method attracted a significant attention because it was simple, cheap, highly efficient, and a rapid quantitative method [11–14].
In extension of our work on Schiff-bases of 2-amino thia- zoles [15–19], the purpose of the current work was the preparation and characterization of isolated solid complexes Co(II), Pb(II), Hg(II) and Cd(II) with H2L. The mode of com- plexes was explained on the basis of many spectroscopic techniques. Also, the biological activity (antimicrobial, anti- oxidant and cytotoxic) of the investigated compounds was tested.

Experimental

Materials and reagents

The materials used were pure (Sigma, Aldrich, or Merck). They involved (a) organic substance such as as 3-hydrazinyl-oxo- N-(thiazole-2-)propanamide and 4-dimethylamino- benzaldehyde, oleic acid (HOL); (b) metal salts such as [Co(CH3COO)2].4H2O, [CdCl2].2H2O, Pb(NO3)2, and HgCl2; (c) solvent
such as diethyl ether, dimethyl formamide, and dimethyl ab- solute ethyl alcohol.

Solutions

Stock solution of oleic acid (HOL) (6.36 × 10−2 mol.L−1) was pre- pared by dispersing 20 mL in one liter of kerosene. Also, stock
solutions of [CdCl2].2H2O and Pb(NO3)2 (1 × 10−2 mol.L−1) were pre- pared in double distilled water. A 1 × 10−2 mol.L−1 stock solutions of H2L was prepared in absolute ethyl alcohol.

Instrumentation

The FTIR spectrophotometer “Mattson 5000, Madison, USA” in the range 4000–400 cm−1 was used to record the infra- red spectra of the ligand and its complexes in KBr disks.
The “EM-390 (200 MHz) on a Varian Mercury-300 instru- ment (Switzerland)” was used to detect the 1H NMR spectra of the ligand, Hg(II) and Cd(II) complexes.
The “Mattson 5000 FTIR spectrophotometer” was used to record the mass spectra.
The magnetic susceptibility balance “Johnson Matthey Wayne, Pennsylvania, USA” with Hg[Co(SCN)4] as calibrant was used to evaluate the magnetic moment values at room temperature (25 ± 1 °C).
The “Shimadzu UV 240 (P/N 204–58000) spectrophotom-
eter (USA) in the range 200–900 nm” was used to record the electronic spectra of the complexes in DMSO.
GBC, SensAA Series Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (com- puterized AAS) with air-acetylene flame was used for the determinations of analyte under the optimum instrumen- tal conditions (228.8 nm as wave length, 0.2–1.8 ppm as working calibrating range with 0.009 μg/mL sensitivity for Cd(II), 217 nm as wave length, and 2.5–10 ppm as working
calibrating range with 0.06 μg/mL sensitivity for Pb(II).
Two types of cells were used in the flotation and separa- tion experiments, which are cylindrical tube of (29, 45) cm in length and (1.2, 6) cm inner diameter with a stopper at the top.
The “Hanna instrument 8519 digital pH meter” was used for the pH measurements.
The “Perkin-Elmer 2400 Series II Analyzer” was used to de- termine the percentage of C, H and N in the synthesized compounds (Table 1).
The standard methods were used to determine the metal contents in the complexes [20].

Synthesis of H2L

The ligand was prepared by mixing equimolar amounts of 3-hydrazinyl-oxo-N-(thiazole-2-)propanamide (0.01 mol; 2 g) and
4-Dimethylamino-benzaldehyde (0.01 mol; 1.5 g), in 50 mL ethanol with 1 mL acetic acid glacial. The ligand was precipi- tated during reflux (3 hrs) and then separated by filtration followed by recrystallization from absolute ethyl alcohol and finally dried in a vacuum desiccator over anhydrous CaCl2. The pureness of the compounds was tested by TLC (Scheme 1).

Synthesis of metal complexes

The solid complexes were prepared by reflux equimolar amounts of H2L (3.31; 10.0 mmol) and 10.0 mmol of cobalt (II),

cadmium (II), lead (II), and mercury (II) salts. The mixture was refluxed for 1–3 h. The formed precipitate was filtered off and washed with hot ethanol and distilled water.

Molecular modeling

The DMOL3 program in Materials Studio package [21,22] was used to evaluate the cluster calculations. The simulations of geometry optimization of the isolated solid compounds were carried out using the density functional theory (DFT) via the GAUSSIAN 09 program package. The DNP basis sets are of analo- gous class to 6-31G Gaussian basis sets [23]. The DNP basis sets are more precise than Gaussian basis sets of identical size [24]. Based on the generalized gradient approximation (GGA), the RPBE functional [25] was considered the most excellent exchange-correlation functional [26]. The geometric optimi- zation is carried out without any regularity restraint.

Biological activity

Antibacterial and antifungal activities in terms of minimum inhibitory concentration

The MIC of the synthesized compounds was determined by applying agar streak dilution method [27].
The strains involved Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis as Gram (+) bacteria; Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa Gram (−) bacteria; and Candida albicans and As- pergillus flavus as fungi.
For anti-bacterial the Ciprofloxacin (100 μg/mL) was used as standard, but Fluconazole (100 μg/mL) was used as stan- dard for anti-fungal.
A stock solution (100 μg/mL) of the examined compounds in DMSO was prepared and then incorporated in specified quantity of molten sterile.
A certain amount of the medium containing tested com- pound was decanted into a Petri dish to reach a depth of 3–4 mm at 40–50 °C and then allowed to solidify.
The micro-organism suspension was set to take about 105 cfu/mL and smeared to plates with diluted compounds in DMSO to be tested and then incubated for 24–48 h at 37 °C.
The MIC was measured until the lowest concentration of the test substance showed no visible growth of bacteria or fungi on the plate.

Anti-oxidant activity screening assay

Anti-oxidant activity screening assay – ABTS method.

In ABTS method, 2 mL of ABTS (2, 2′-azinobis-(3- ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)) solution (60 mM), 3 mL MnO2 solution (25 mg/mL) and 5 mL aqueous phosphate buffer solution (pH 7, 0.1 M) were added to tested compounds.
The mixture was shaken, centrifuged, filtered and then the absorbance was measured at λ734 nm of the resultant green– blue solution (ABTS radical solution).
Then, 50 mL of the tested compounds (2 mM) in spectro- scopic grade methanol/phosphate buffer (1:1) was added.

The absorbance was detected and the color intensity re- duction was expressed as % inhibition. The standard antioxidant L-ascorbic acid was used as a positive control.
Blank sample was run without ABTS and using methanol/ phosphate buffer (1:1) in place of tested compounds. However, the ABTS and methanol/phosphate buffer (1:1) was used as a negative control [28,29].

where Ablank is the absorbance of the control reaction, and Asample is the absorbance in the presence of the samples or standards.

Anti-oxidant screening assay for erythrocyte hemolysis. By cardiac puncture the blood was collected in heparinized tubes. Erythrocytes were obtained from plasma and the buffy coat. Then, it was washed by NaCl (0.15 M) three times. Then, at 2500 rpm the erythrocytes were centrifuged to attain a regu- larly packed cell for 10 min. In this assay system erythrocyte hemolysis was mediated by peroxyl radicals [30]. To test the samples at various concentrations a 10% suspension of eryth- rocytes in pH 7.4 PBS was added to the identical volume of 200 mM of AAPH solution. Then the reaction mixture was shaken and incubated at 37 °C for one hour. After this, the mixture was detached, diluted with PBS (eight volumes) and centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 10 min. The absorbance (A) of the supernatant was detected at 540 nm. As well, eight volumes of distilled water were added to the mixture to achieve whole hemolysis, and then at 540 nm the absorbance (B) of the su- pernatant was achieved after centrifugation was measured. The
% hemolysis was determined via the following equation:

% hemolysis  1  A B  100%

Cell proliferation assay.

The inhibitory effects of compounds on cell growth were determined by MTT colorimetric assay [31,32].
The antibiotics used were 100 units/mL penicillin + 100 μg/ mL streptomycin at 37 °C under 5% CO2 for 48 h incubator and seeds in a 96-well plate with density 1.0 × 104 cells/ well [33,34].
Then a different concentration of compounds was con- served into the incubated cells for 24 h. After 24 h, 20 μL of MTT solution at 5 mg/mL was added and incubated for 4 h.
Then DMSO in volume of 100 μL was added to each well to dissolve the purple formazan. By using a plate reader (EXL 800, USA) the colorimetric test was determined at absor- bance of 570 nm.
The % of relative cell viability was determined by using the following equation:

A570 of treated samplesA570 of untreated sample  100

Flotation–separation procedure. A definite amount of Cd(II) or Pb(II) solutions, quantified for each investigation process, was mixed with a solution of prepared ligand. The pH of previous mixture was adjusted with HNO3 and/or NaOH to the desired value. Then, the solution was invented to 10 mL
with double distilled water, and then the cell was shaken well for 2 min to ensure complete complexation. After this, 2 mL of surfactant (HOL with known concentration) was added and the cell was then inverted upside down strongly twenty five times by hand and was left for five minutes standing for com- plete flotation. Finally the concentration of Cd(II) or Pb(II) ions that remained in the mother liquor was analyzed via AAS. The floatability (F %) of Cd(II) or Pb(II) ions was calculated accord- ing to the following relation:

F %  Ci  Cf Ci  100

where Ci and Cf are the initial and the final concentrations of Cd(II) or Pb(II) ions in the mother liquor, respectively.


Results and discussion

IR and mass spectra

The H2L and its metal complexes’ significant infrared bands were taken to detect the influence of a metal bonding on the ligand vibration in the solid complexes. The ligand IR spec- trum showed a medium-intensity broad bands due to υ(NH)1,
υ(NH)2 and υ(CH2) at 3200, 3174 and 3089 cm−1 [35], respec-
tively. Also, there are three sharp bands observed due to υ(C=N) [36], υ(C=O)1 and υ(C=O)2 [37] at 1605, 1688 and 1667 cm−1, re-
spectively (Table 2). Also, the MS of H2L displayed the molecular
ion peak [M]+ of H2L at m/z = 331.342 (34.28%) which is equal to its molecular weight and relating to the moiety of the ligand [(C15H17O2N5S) atomic mass 331.353 u] (Fig. 1).
In the IR spectra of [Co(HL)2], [Hg(HL)(H2O)2Cl] and [Cd(HL)2] complexes, H2L behaved as a mononegative tridentate ligand coordinating via (C=N), carbonyl oxygen (C=O)1 and (C=O—)2. This chelation mode was maintained by (i) the disappear- ance of υ(C=O)2 and υ(NH)2 with immediate entrance of new bands at 1603–1611 and 1065–1189 cm−1 which is attributable to υ(C=N)*2 and υ(=C—O)2 (enolic) respectively [38], (ii) the shift of azomethine nitrogen υ(C—N) and υ(C—O)1 to lower wave numbers and (iii) the presence of novel bands in the 521–524 and 460–486 cm−1 region which is ascribed to υ(M—O)and υ(M—N), respectively [39].
Also, the IR spectrum of [PbL(H2O)3] complex showed that
H2L acted as a binegative tridentate ligand coordinating via (C=N) and (=C—O—)1 (=C—O—)2. This mode was proposed by (i) the shift of (C=N) to lower wavenumber, (ii) the disap- pearance of υ(C=O)1, υ(C=O)2, υ(NH)1 and υ(NH)2 with instantaneous appearance of new band at 1624, 1605, 1179 and 1124 cm−1, which is attributable to υ(C=N)*1, υ(C=N)*2, υ(=C–
O)1(enolic) and υ(=C–O)2 (enolic), respectively, and (iii) the appearance
of new bands at 521 and 423 cm−1 which may be ascribed to
υ(M—O)and υ(M—N) respectively [39].

Nuclear magnetic resonance spectral studies

In H2L and its Hg(II) and Cd(II) complexes 1H NMR spectra were detected in DMSO. There are two signals at 11.27 and 12.23 ppm attributed to the protons of (NH)1 and (NH)2, respectively, in the spectrum of H2L (Fig. 2). In 6.60–8.04 ppm region multiplet signals

276	egyptian  journal  of  basic  and  applied  sciences  3 (2016) 2 7 2–286 


were observed related to the —N=CH— and aromatic protons. At 3.46 and 3.79 ppm there are two sharp singlet related to active methylene protons (—CH2) and ph–N—(CH3)2, respec- tively. Also, the 1H NMR spectra of the Cd(II) and Hg(II) complexes showed the signal ascribed to the (NH)1 and proton represent- ing that these group played no part in coordination. But the absence of signal due to (NH)2 proton gave emphasis to the deprotonation of the enolized carbonyl oxygen (—C=O)2.

Magnetic moments and electronic spectra

The electronic spectrum of [Co(HL)2] complex showed two bands at 20 618 and 16 949 cm−1 ascribed to 4T1g → 4A2g (F) and 4T1g
→ 4T1g (P) transitions, respectively, in an octahedral configu- ration [40]. The calculated values of Dq, B, β and υ2/υ1 values are in good promise with those informed for octahedral Co(II)
complexes. The position of υ 1 (7901 cm−1) was calculated theo- retically [40]. Also, the values of the magnetic moments value
(μeff. = 5.0 BM) are reliable with octahedral geometry around the Co(II) ion.

Geometry optimization with DFT method

The design of new molecular compounds can be recognized by applying computational chemistry tools, which is a potent protocol for interpreting their stabilities and calculated lots of structural parameters for multidentate Schiff base ligand (Table 3).
DFT calculations are performed to predict the host–gust in- teraction between the Schiff base and various metal cations. The molecular structure beside atom numbering of H2L and its metal complexes is presented in Structure 1.

Molecular parameters
The Quantum chemical parameters (the energies of the HOMO and LUMO) of investigated compounds were attained. Also, the total energy, binding energy, spin polarization energy, exchange- correlation energy, electrostatic energy, kinetic energy, sum of atomic energy and dipole moment were calculated (Table 3). From the attained data we can assumed that:

The energies of the HOMO and LUMO are negative values, which showed the stability of isolated complexes (Fig. 3).
The lower EHOMO values point to the molecule donating electron ability is frailer. On contrasting, the greater HOMO energy recommended that the molecule is a decent elec- tron donor.
The binding energy of complexes was higher than free ligand, which indicated great the stability of the isolated solid complexes.
The free ligand showed higher values of dipole moment than the isolated solid complexes that improved the potent ac- tivities of the free ligands.

Molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) of H2L
The MEP was considered a good descriptor for decisive sites for electrophilic and nucleophilic attack [41]. In the present study, 3D plots of MEP were drawn for the ligand and their metal complexes (Fig. 4). Based on the MEP, one can generally order the electron-rich area which has red color on the map (favor

site for electrophilic attack). However, the electron-poor region has blue color (favor site for nucleophilic attack) [42]. But the region with green color points to neutral electrostatic poten- tial region.

Biological activity

The Schiff bases’ biological activity stimulated us to assume systematic studies on their complexation affinity and test their abilities against economically vital fungi and bacteria [43,44].

Antifungal activity
The results showed that the ligand and its metal complexes have  significant  activity  against  Candida  albicans  and
Aspergillus flavus (Table 4). The ligand (H2L) and [Co(HL)2] complex were more effective against Aspergillus flavus than Candida albicans in comparison with the Fluconazole as standard drug [45].


Antibacterial activity
The investigated compounds along with Ciprofloxacin (stan- dard drug) and DMSO (solvent control) were screened separately for their antibacterial activity [46–48]. The activity of the tested compounds was compared to the activity of Ciprofloxacin as a standard antibiotic. The MIC values showed that H2L and [Co(HL)2] complex have the highest antibacterial activity (Table 5).

The antioxidant activity of ligand and its metal complexes
The antioxidant rank of prepared compounds was measured using ABTS assay [49]. All tested compounds have low anti-
oxidant activity in comparison with complex [Co(HL)2], which displayed the maximum antioxidant activity in comparison with standard ascorbic-acid. Moreover, the anti-oxidant activity of prepared compounds was tested for erythrocyte hemolysis. All

the tested compounds demonstrated weak anti-oxidative ac- tivity in the hemolysis assay, but [Co(HL)2] gave better results (Tables 6 and 7). The significant antioxidant activity was at- tributable to the existence of two carbonyl (C=O) and azomethine (C=N) groups.

The cytotoxicity of H2L and its metal complexes on HCT-116 cell line
The cytotoxicity assays of H2L and its metal complexes against human colorectal carcinoma cells lines (HCT) are illustrated in Table 8. The data observed that [Co(HL)2] (IC50 = 11.4 μM) dem- onstrated a much higher inhibitory effect than the other isolated compounds. However, [Hg(HL)(H2O)2Cl] complex which has higher IC50 value (>100 μg/mL) showed nearly no activity [50].

Ion-flotation separation

Influence of initial pH
Some experiments were conducted to study the effect of the pH of a solution on the floatability of 2 × 10−4 mol L−1 of metal ions using 2 × 10−4 mol L−1 of prepared ligand and 1 × 10−3 mol L−1 of HOL. The results showed that higher floatability was de- tected at the pH range of 5–9 for Cd(II) and 6–9 for Pb(II) ions (Fig. 5). This eases the ability to apply the prepared ligand for the separation of metal ions from different media. Hence, pH
~7 was fixed for further experiments.
Influence of initial metal concentration
Efforts to float different concentrations of Pb(II) and Cd(II) ions
were carried out with 2 × 10−4 mol L−1 ligand (H2L) + 1 × 10−3 mol L−1 HOL at pH~7. The maximum flotation efficiency of Cd(II) and
Pb(II) ions was determined for the prepared ligand whenever the ratio of M:L is (1:1) (Fig. 6). The chelating agent gave quan- titative separation of Cd(II) and Pb(II) ions (~100%), which may be ascribed to the presence of sufficient amounts of pre- pared ligand to bind all Cd(II) and Pb(II) ions. Therefore, the ratio of M:L of 1:1 was used throughout.

Influence of ligand concentration
The collecting ability of prepared ligand toward Cd(II) and Pb(II) ions was tested to show the effect of different concentra- tions of prepared ligand on the floatability of the analytes using 1 × 10−3 mol L−1 HOL at pH~7. The data revealed that the float- ability of Cd(II) and Pb(II) ions increases sharply reaching its maximum value at M:L ratio of 1:1 (Fig. 7). Excess ligand has no adverse effect on the flotation process, and accordingly 2 × 10−4 mol L−1 of prepared ligand was used throughout.

Influence of surfactant concentration
Several trials were examined to float Cd(II) and Pb(II) ions with surfactants only, but the maximum recovery received was 43%. Thus, extra series of experiments were done to float 2 × 10−4 mol L−1 Cd(II) and Pb(II) ions in the presence of

2 × 10−4 mol L−1 of H2L and various concentrations of HOL (1 × 10−3−5 × 10−2 mol L−1) at pH~7. The results proved that the high floatation % of Cd(II) and Pb(II) ions was achieved in the
concentration range 1 × 10−3−9 × 10−3 mol L−1 of HOL (Fig. 8).
It was noticed that; the incomplete separation of Cd(II) and Pb(II) ions at higher surfactant concentration regarding to the fact that; the addition of surfactant led to change in the state of formed complexes from coagulated precipitate to re-
dispersion through coagulation flotation. Furthermore, at high surfactant concentration, the poor flotation resulted from the

formation of hydrated and stable envelope of surfactant on the air bubble surface or due to the formation of a hydrated micelle coating on the solid surface [51,52]. Consequently, increasing the hydrophobicity of the surface had an adverse effect on the

flotation process. Thus, HOL with concentration of 1 × 10−3 mol L−1 was fixed throughout.

Influence of temperature
A series of experiments were done to test the floatation of Cd(II) or Pb(II) ions under a temperature range of 10–80 °C and the recommended conditions. For this purpose, a mixture con- taining Cd(II) or Pb(II) ions and H2L and separated HOL solutions was either heated or cooled to the proposed temperature in a water bath. Then HOL solution was poured into Cd(II) or Pb(II) ions solution into the flotation cell, then jacketed with 1 cm thick fiberglass insulation and shaken well. According to results illustrated in Fig. 9, the decrease in separation efficiency by raising temperature over 80 °C may be due to increasing the

solubility of the precipitate and the instability of the foam raising the partial dissolution of the precipitate and decreas- ing the ability of foam to hold up the precipitate [53].

Interference study
The effect of foreign ions on the separation process is very im- portant in order to investigate the ability of proposed method to be applied on real water samples. So the effect of various concentrations of both cations and anions, usually present in some water samples, on the removal percentage of 10 mg L−1
Cd(II) or Pb(II) ions at pH 7 and 30 mg L−1 H2L was studied. Chlo-
ride salts of cations were used, whereas the anions were used as the corresponding potassium or sodium salts. The toler-

able amounts of each ion, giving an error of ±4% in the removal efficiency of Cd(II) or Pb(II) ions, are listed in Table 9. It was proven that foreign ions with relatively high concentrations (in comparison with that of Cd(II) or Pb(II) ions) did not affect badly the flotation of cadmium or lead and the procedure can be applied on water samples.


Application
In order to inspect the applicability of the recommended pro- cedure, a series of experiments were carried out to recover 10 mg L−1 of Cd(II) or Pb(II) ions spiked to 1 L of aqueous so- lution and some real water samples. Flotation experimentations were done using 50 mL clear, filtered, uncontaminated sample solutions at pH 7. The results showed that the recovery per- centage was quantitative and agreeable under the recommended conditions of the applied flotation procedure (Table 10).

Conclusions

In this paper, Co(II), Pb(II), Hg(II) and Cd(II) complexes of the 3-(2-(4-(dimethylamino)benzylidene)hydrazinyl)-3-oxo-N- (thiazol-2-yl)propanamide (H2L) were synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis, spectroscopy tech- niques and physical measurements. The results showed that the H2L acted as a mononegative or binegative tridentate ligand. Also, DFT calculations were done to predict the host–gust in- teraction between the Schiff base and various metal cations. Furthermore, the ligand and its complexes were screened for biological activity. The results show that the H2L and Co(II) complex have highest biological activity. Also, it is success- fully applied the recovery of Cd(II) or Pb(II) ions that obtained from different environmental water samples as shown in Table 10. The flotation mechanism was proposed dependent on the formation of hydrogen bonding between oleic acid sur- factant and cadmium–ligand or lead–ligand complex.

Suggested flotation mechanism
The mechanism of the flotation of metal–ligand precipitates is suggested depending on the following points:

Cd(II) and Pb(II) reacted with the prepared ligand in a M:L ratio of 1:1 to give the complex M2L according to the fol- lowing equation:

M2  H2L  M2L  2H

The prepared ligand has several sites comprising electro- negative atoms, such as carbonyl oxygen (C=O) and azomethine nitrogen (C=N) as shown in Scheme 1.
Oleic acid began to dissociate at pH >5.2 [54] and the per-
centage of various forms of oleic acid is determined by IR analysis, and the data are presented in Table 11. The IR spectra of oleic acid with changing pH indicated that at 1300–
1800 cm−1, there are bands characteristic of the groups CO2H, CO2− and CO2− contained with Na [55]. These data agree with those reported [56] that the C=O stretching band of oleic acid at 1705 cm−1 was shifted because of ionization to bands in the range 1520–1540 cm−1 for sodium oleate. As a result, oleic acid has the ability to interact with other systems, via
hydrogen bond formation, either in its dissociated (R- COO-) or un-dissociated (R-COOH) forms depending on the pH of the medium and according to the following:

R-COOH  MHL  R-COOH  LHM

R-COO  MHL  R-COO  LHM

The combination of oleic acid surfactant with the cadmium– ligand or lead–ligand chelate gave hydrophobic aggregates that float with the help of air bubbles, which are created inside the flotation cell by shaking gently up to the surface of the solu- tion [57].
