Abstract
We discuss an algorithmic construction which, for any finite but universal set of computable quantum gates and a given measurement basis, will produce a rational quantum circuit whose shortest є-approximations from products of instances of the gates have sizes which grow at least exponentially in the input sizes of the circuits and logarithmically in the reciprocal of є. We also discuss the constructive content of the Solovay-Kitaev theorem by considering the algorithmic enumeration of all quantum circuits of a given input size.
Keywords: Large quantum circuits, Solovay-Kitaev theorem. computable representations.

Introduction
In [3], we find a discussion, among other things, of the programmability of universal quantum Turing machines. In this paper, we expand on this discussion and consider algorithmic and complexity issues around the effective construction of quantum circuits. Many beautiful papers have been written on this subject and many open problems still remain to be addressed. We shall consider an algorithmic version of a converse of the Solovay-Kitaev theorem. (A proof of this theorem can be found in Appendix 3 of the book [7].)
We shall look at the problem of finding a computable enumeration of unitary operators on a given finite-dimensional complex Hilbert space and the implications of such an enumeration for the algorithmic content of the Solovay-Kitaev theorem. The proof of the lower bounds in this paper was inspired by the techniques developed by Knill [4] and Nielsen and Chuang [7]. The reader is also referred to
[4] for a critique of the claims in [2].

We introduce oracle computations relative to Rabin’s computable representation of the field of algebraic numbers in order to find effective enumerations of algebraic unitary operators on a given finite-dimensional complex Hilbert space. The latter discussions are perhaps (or definitely) of less importance to quantum computation per se, but do pose interesting arithmetical and computational challenges ...


The Solovay-Kitaev theorem
In principle, in the quantum gate model, a quantum computation works as follows.
The first step typically involves the preprocessing of the input data on a classical computer. For example, in the Shor algorithm for the factoring problem we must ensure in a classical way that the input number m is not a prime power.
Based on these preprocessed data, we have to prepare the quantum register. This means in the most simple case to prepare classical data, e.g., a binary string x of length N , say, as the state |x⟩ in 2N -dimensional Hilbert space. In most cases, however, one would be required to prepare a superposition of states |x⟩.
Next we apply the quantum circuit C, which is a sequence of local quantum operators, to the input state |φ⟩ and after the calculation we get the output state
|U φ⟩ where U is the unitary operator corresponding to C.
To read out the data we perform a von Neumann measurement on the computa- tional basis.
Finally, we may have to postprocess the value on a classical computer. In general we obtain a correct result with probability less than one which means we have to check the validity of the result with a polynomial time algorithm and if wrong, we have to go back to the third step.
Hence, in this model, a quantum computation is a hybrid of classical and prob- abilistic algorithms coupled with quantum evolutions of prepared quantum states. In order to discuss programmability in this context, we recall the notion of instruction sets. (For more on this idea, see, for example the book [7] and [1].) An
instruction set G for a multiqubit input of a fixed length d is a ﬁnite set of quantum
gates satisfying
All gates V G are in SU (2d), that is, they are unitary operators on the 2d- dimensional Hilbert space H⊗d where H is 2-dimensional over C and each has determinant one.
For each V ∈ G the inverse operation V † also belongs to G.
The group generated by G is topologically dense in SU (2d). This means that for any given quantum gate U	SU (d) and any measure of accuracy ϵ > 0, there exists a finite product V = V1V2 ... Vk of instances of gates from G which is an ϵ-approximation to U , that is to say, such that U	V1V2 ... Vk < ϵ. Here . denotes the standard operator norm.

Suppose V is a unitary operator acting on H⊗f . For d  f , we call a unitary operator on H⊗d an instance of V if it is any operator acting like V on a fixed f of the possible d qubits and as the identity on the remaining qubits.
Suppose U and V are two unitary operators on the same state space with U the target unitary operator that we wish to implement and V = V1V2 ... Vk is the unitary operator that is actually implemented from an instruction set as above. Let M be a positive operator valued measure (POVM) element associated with the measurement and let PU (or PV ) be the probability of obtaining the corresponding, measurement outcome if the operation U (or V ) was performed with a starting state
|φ⟩. Then it can be shown that
|PU − PV | = |⟨φ|U MU|φ⟩− ⟨φ|V †MV |φ⟩| ≤ 2||U − V ||.
(See [7].) This inequality gives quantitative expression to the idea that when the er- ror U  V  is small, the difference in probabilities between measurement outcomes is also small.
An example of universal gates is one ”generated” by instances of T , the Toffoli gate, and H, the Hadamard gate and the phase gates. It is ”generated” in the following sense: We consider all unitary operators for d-qubits which is a tensor product of instances of H, T , the phase gates together with their inverses. Then this set G is an instruction set for multiqubits of length d. (See[7].)
The problem of quantum compilation is the following: Given an instruction set G, how may we approximate an arbitrary quantum gate by means of a finite sequence of instructions from G in a manner which is both effective (i.e., computable in the classical sense), and efficient as far as both the time and space complexity are concerned. The Solovay-Kitaev theorem gives a truly remarkable contribution to this problem.
Theorem 2.1 Let G be an instruction set for SU (2d), and let a desired measure of accuracy ϵ > 0 be given. There is a universal constant c such that for any U in SU (2d), there exists a ﬁnite sequence S of instances of gates from G of length Od(logc(1/ϵ)) such that the product of the sequence S is within ϵ of U with respect to the operator norm.
More precisely, an arbitrary unitary operator U on d qubits can be approximated to within a distance ϵ by using O(d24d logc(d24d/ϵ)) instances of gates from G. This can be shown to be close to optimal in the following sense: For a given instruction set G and a measure of accuracy ϵ > 0, there are unitary transformations U on d qubits which take Ω(2d log(1/ϵ)/ log(d)) instances of gates from G to implement an approximation V such that U V < ϵ. We shall later discuss how such a unitary operator U can be algorithmically constructed from the instruction set G.
Many authors state that the Solovay-Kitaev approximation can be done in an effective and efficient manner. This must be read with some care! We call a unitary operation recursive with respect to the chosen measurement basis if all its matrix entries relative to this basis are recursive complex numbers. Recall that a complex number is a recursive complex number provided both its real and imaginary parts are recursive real numbers. A real number x is recursive if there is an algorithmic

procedure which with input a natural number n will yield a binary rational number of the form k/2n such that |x − k/2m| < 1/2n.
Suppose now that all the matrix entries of the gates in G with respect to the orthonormal basis in which the measurement is performed are recursive complex numbers, but that U is not recursive relative to this basis. Suppose we have an effective procedure that will yield for any given natural n descriptions of instances of gates V1,..., Vm from G such that  U  V1  Vm  < 1/n. Then it is clear that all the matrix coefficients of U with respect to the measurement basis are complex recursive numbers – contradiction.
However, algorithmically, this will turn out to be possible provided U is recursive with respect to the measurement basis as we will explain in the next section.
It is also claimed that this accuracy can be obtained in general using Od(log2.71(1/ϵ) computational steps. As we understand matters at this stage this is correct if the computation is relative to an oracle that has complete information about U with respect to the measurement basis.
Much remains to be investigated as to how the computational complexity or arithmetical structure of U affects this claim. In the following three sections we shall begin to look at this problem from various perspectives.

Effective enumeration of quantum circuits
We write H for the 2-dimensional Hilbert space over the complex numbers and H⊗n
for the tensor product of n copies of H.
Definition 3.1 For a natural number n, and a fixed (ordered) measurement basis B on H⊗n, an effective enumeration of the recursive quantum gates on H⊗n is an enumeration (Uj) of all the unitary operators on H⊗n, such that there is an algorithmic procedure which will, for given natural numbers j, k, l and n, yield integers k1, k2, with the property that
k1	k2	1
|ukl − ( 2n + i 2n )| < 2n ,
where ukl is the kl-th entry of the matrix representation of Uj with respect to the measurement basis B. (A quantum circuit U is recursive, relatively to a measure- ment basis of course, if all its matrix entries are recursive complex numbers.)
In order to construct such an effective enumeration, we must side-step the fact that for a given effective enumeration of recursive complex numbers, it is not possible to algorithmically decide equality between two recursive complex numbers from their programs (codes).
Proposition 3.2 For a natural number n, and a ﬁxed (ordered) measurement basis B on H⊗n, there is an effective enumeration of all the recursive (relatively to B) quantum gates on H⊗n.
Proof. It follows from Eulers characterisation of Pythagorean triples that the points with rational coordinates on the unit circle is dense in the unit circle. This

means that the set of real numbers θ such that both sin θ and cos θ are rational numbers, is dense in the set of real numbers. By using spherical coordinates for the points on the unit sphere in real finite-dimensional Euclidean space, we thus see that the set of points with rational coordinates is dense in the unit sphere.
We fix B and an effective enumeration of all the recursive complex numbers. We write S for the unit sphere in H⊗n and Sr for the points in S whose coordinates relative to B are rational complex numbers. Since Sr is dense in S, it follows that, for any linear operator M on H⊗n and a natural number k,
||Mφ|| < k ↔ ∃φ∈Sr ||M φ|| < k.
We can thus effectively enumerate all operators with recursive coefficients (rela- tively to B) on H⊗n as (Mjk) such that, for every k, the associated Mjk are all the operators satisfying ||Mjk|| < k.
With every Mjk we associate the selfadjoint operator Hjk = (Mjk + M† )/2. Note that Hjk = Mjk when Mjk happens to be selfadjoint. Finaly define the unitary operators Vjk by Vjk = eiHjk . By using the Taylor series expansion of the exponential funtion, the sequence (Vjk) can be effectively enumerated. This sequence contains all the unitary operators on H⊗n since for any unitary V , there is a selfadjoint H such that V = eiH . This is a simple consequence of the spectral theorem. Finally let η : ω ω2 be a recursive bijection and define Uj by Uj = Vη(j). Then the sequence (Uj) is an effective enumeration of all the recursive quantum circuits of input size n. This concludes the proof of the proposition.

Large rational quantum circuits
We write H for the 2-dimensional Hilbert space over the complex numbers. We fix a natural number n and consider the approximations of unitary operators U on H⊗n by products P of instances on H⊗n of sequences of elements in G. We shall frequently refer to such a product P as a unitary operator on H⊗n generated by G. For a natural number l, we denote by Gl all unitary operators on H⊗n generated by G which can be written as the product of at most l instances of elements in G. We shall call a unitary operator U rational if the matrix coefficients (with respect to the measurement basis) are rational complex numbers.
We shall prove the following
Theorem 4.1 Let G be an instruction set with recursive gates relative to a chosen measurement basis for H⊗n. There is a uniform algorithm which, for a given n and a rational ϵ with 0 < ϵ < 1 , will yield a rational unitary operator on U on H⊗n, such that, if l is such that for some V ∈ Gl it is the case that ||U − V || < ϵ, then

(1)
1 (2n+1 − 1) log 1

l ≥ 3 gf log n	2ϵ.
Here g is the number of gates in G and f is the largest number of qubit inputs to a gate in G.
Proof. Set N = 2n. Let m be the smallest natural number l, such that each

unitary operator U on H⊗n can be approximated within ϵ by some element in Gl. The existence of such a number l follows directly from the Solavay-Kitaev theorem. It also follows from the fact that ∪l≥1Gl is dense in the compact group SU (N ).
Let φ0 in H⊗n be an element of the (pre-given) measurement basis and let L be the number of unit vectors in H⊗n of the form Pφ0 with P Gm. Denote these vectors by ψ1,..., ψL. It is clear that

(2)
L ≤   n g 
≤ n	.

Each element in H⊗n can be presented as a point on the unit sphere S in the 2N -dimensional real vector space over the real numbers where N = 2n. For a point u  S write B(u, ϵ) for the ϵ-neighbourhood of u in S with respect to standard l2-norm. We note that
L
S ⊆	B(ψi, ϵ).
i=1
Indeed, let φ  S and choose an unitary operator U such that φ = Uφ0. Such an unitary operator can be found by an application of the Gram-Schmidt orthogonal- isation procedure. By construction, there is some P ∈ Gm such that
||P − U|| < ϵ.

In particular,

If Pφ = ψi, say, then ||φ − ψi|| < ϵ.
Since

||φ − P φ|| < ϵ.

S ⊆	B(ψi, ϵ),

writing μ for the standard spherical measure on S, it follows that
μ(S) ≤ Lμ(B(ψ1, ϵ)).
It follows from Lemma 2.4 of [4] that
μ(B(ψ1, ϵ))	(ϵ√1 − ϵ2/4)2N−1


Consequently,

We now show that the rational unitary operators are dense in the group SU (N ). Choose an instruction set consisting of 2-dimensional gates. Since the rational points are dense in the unit circle, for every η > 0, we can find, for all gates G in
, some rational gate which is an η-approximation to G. Let m be the smallest natural number l, such that each unitary operator U on H⊗n can be approximated within ϵ by some element in Gl. For a given ϵ > 0, choose η > 0 such that mη < ϵ. Then, for U ∈ SU (N ), there is some rational V such that
||U − V || < ϵ + mη < 2ϵ.

Fix ϵ > 0 and choose U such that if l is such that, for some V ∈ Gl it is the case that ||V − U|| < 2ϵ, then

Let Ur be a rational unitary operator such that ||Ur − U|| < ϵ. Then, if V ∈ Gl
and ||V − Ur|| < ϵ, it will follow that
||V − U|| < 2ϵ.
Consequently, Ur is a rational unitary operator that satisfies the conclusion of the theorem.
We now turn to the construction of such Ur’s. We can recursively enumerate all the rational unitary operators H⊗n as U1, U2,.. ., say. By this we mean that there is an algorithm which, for any given j, computes all the codes of the matrix entries of Uj.
For given n and ϵ as in the formulation of the theorem, let M (n, ϵ) be given by the right-hand side of (1). We have shown that

(3)
∃i∀l<M (n,є)∀V ∈GÆ ||Ui − V || > ϵ.
Note that if we have a description of V as a product of l instances of gates in

G, then since

||Ui − V || > ϵ ↔ ∃φ∈Sr ||Uiφ − V φ|| > ϵ,

it follows from (3) that some Ui with the required property can be computed from
n and ϵ. This concludes the proof of the theorem.
Algebraic circuits
In this section we consider the computational issues that arise from the construction of quantum circuits whose matrix coefficients are algebraic numbers.
Let A be the algebraic closure of the field of rational numbers in the field of complex numbers. It was shown by Rabin in [8] that there is a one-to-one map Φ from A onto a recursive subset B of ω = 0, 1, 2,.. . such that the field operations correspond under this map with recursive functions. Such a Φ will be called a computable representation of A. We fix such a function Φ in the sequel.
A predicate P on Ak is said to be Φ-decidable if there is a decidable predicate Q on ωk with the property that, for (α1,..., αk)  Ak, it is the case that P (α1,..., αk) holds if and only Q(n1,..., nk) holds, where ni = Φ(αi) for i = 1,..., k. For example, if p is a polynomial with integer coeffients, then the question p(α) = 0 is Φ-decidable. Similarly, a function
ƒ : Ak → A
is said to be Φ-recursive if the correspondinding function on Bk is recursive. One can in this way develop all Φ-versions of arithmetic predicates and functions on tuples of elements in ω.
Since one can Φ-decide whether or not an algebraic number is 1, or 0, one can Φ-effectively enumerate all algebraic unitary operators on H⊗n.

Let π : B ω  Q[i] , where Q[i] denote the rationals, be any function which maps any element of the form (n, k) to a complex rational number αk such that, if Φ(α) = n, then |α − α | < 1 k.
It is an interesting problem to determine the extent the function π can be com- puted from Φ. As was noted by van den Dries [9], there is a standard algorithm which, given the code for a algebraic number α, will yield the coefficients of the irreducible polynomial of which α is the root. Following Lachlan and Madison [5], a notation for an algebraic number α, is any triple (ƒ, ρ, n) where ƒ is a polynomial in one variable with integer coefficients, ρ is a complex rational, and n is a rational number such that ξ = α is the unique solution of
1
ƒ (ξ) = 0 ∧ |ξ − ρ| < n.
It was pointed out in [9], that, for a given triple (ƒ, ρ, n) we can effectively decide whether or not it a notation for some algebraic α by using Tarski’s decision method for real closed fields. If we now take van den Dries’s remark into account, we can conclude that the Ui enumeration has the additional property that for given i one can, relatively to Φ, effectively find arbitrarily accurate complex rational approximations to all the roots of the irreducible polynomials of every matrix entry of Ui. The problem is that we do not know which rational approximation belongs to which root.
