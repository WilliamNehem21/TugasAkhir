The effeteness of MPPT algorithms is deteriorated by having more Maximum Power Points (MPPs) on the characteristics of the PV array. The number of MPPs can increase with the different connection types of PV panels and the pattern of partial shading, and it also changes the P–V (Power–Voltage) characteristics of the panel. Therefore, it is important to consider different combinations of algorithms, connection types and partial shading patterns for an effective PV plant design. This study assesses the performance of a PV power plant including a 5 × 5 PV array by considering eight different connection types, six partial shading conditions (PSCs), and three well-known MPPT algorithms, all together, on the TMS320F28335 DSP platform. The obtained results and analyses show that the TCT (Total Cross Tied) connection type has higher performance than the other connection types under all PSCs with an average of 25.98% Mismatched Loss (ML), 54.3% Fill
Factor (FF) and 13.45% efficiency (𝜂). As for the shading patterns, the Diagonal (DG) pattern has less effect
on the system’s ML and FF values, and the Long Wide (LW) pattern is less effective in reducing system 𝜂.
Regarding the algorithms, it has been proven that the performance of a PV system using the simplest form of the basic algorithms can reach the performance of the system using complex algorithms when the connection type is well-adjusted according to the shading patterns. Overall, the given analyses and results prove the significance of taking into account the combination of different MPPT algorithms, types of panel connections, and partial shading patterns to enhance PV system power efficiency and reduce the complexity of PV power plant installations.





Introduction

As the global population grows and energy consumption rises, the deficit in fossil fuels is becoming more prominent, revealing the sig- nificance of using renewable energy sources (RESs) [1,2]. The growth of fields and applications that utilize solar energy, which is a widely preferred type among RES, has played an important role in reducing the dependency on fossil fuels in the electrical power generation policies of countries [3]. Photovoltaic (PV) panels that allow solar energy har- vesting contribute to reducing environmental concerns. Moreover, easy installation, lower maintenance cost, and non-dynamic structures make the PV systems feasible for individual users and large-scale renewable energy-based electrical power generation systems [4,5].
Due to these factors, the effectiveness of PV systems’ energy con- version has taken center stage. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of PV systems is significantly impacted by environmental conditions like temperature and insolation. It also depends on the PV panel’s intrinsic
nonlinear properties (I–V, or current–voltage, and P–V, or power– voltage) [6]. Engineers and scientists in this industry are thus interested in getting the most power possible from PV panels. Therefore, achieving high efficiency in PV systems requires an MPPT approach. By adjusting the power converters that are being used, such as the DC–DC converter and inverter, the PV panel is compelled to operate at the highest voltage and current points in this method.
In the last decade, several MPPT algorithms have been developed and implemented with many contributions to ensure that the PV panel’s electrical power will be at its peak value under different conditions. Many of these maximum power extraction schemes can be assessed with their performance criteria, such as accuracy, dynamic behavior, and complexity [7,8]. However, it is commonly preferred to categorize MPPT algorithms as conventional, intelligent, optimization, and hybrid methods [9–11]. For conventional MPPT algorithms, the Constant Volt- age (CV), Open Circuit Voltage (OCV), Incremental Conductance (InC)

and Perturbation and Observe (P&O) algorithms, which are commonly known algorithms, form the basis of MPPT techniques [12]. With the advantages of a fast dynamic response, simple structure, and lower
computational burden, these conventional algorithms mostly perform superior Maximum Power Point (MPP) tracking capability at stable and uniform external conditions. However, once the Partial Shading Condition (PSC) occurs, where the PV panels are exposed to different levels of irradiance, the characteristics of the PV array are recast from monotonic to non-monotonic one. Under this condition, the unsatisfac- tory performance of the conventional algorithms initiates a quest to find an improved version.
Additionally, apart from the conventional algorithms, intelligent and optimization algorithms are adopted for the MPPT system, which



can be found in the literature as Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC), Arti- ficial Neural Network (ANN), Cuckoo Search (CS), Ant Colony Opti- mization (ACO), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) algorithms and many more. As with conventional algorithms, these algorithms have enhanced variants that improve the system performance under PSC [13–20]. Furthermore, not only does PSC affect the performance of these algorithms, but also, the connection type of the PV panels affects the performance of all the MPPT algo- rithms, where P–V characteristics have multiple peak points known as Local Maximum (LM) as in PSC. Therefore, it is understood that the connection types of PV panels and PSC make it difficult to capture the Global Maximum (GM) point on the P–V curve of the PV arrays for all MPPT algorithms, especially when different partial shading patterns are examined together with different PV panel connections.
Most recently, improved versions of the aforementioned algorithms, mainly focused on the PSO, P&O and InC, can be found in this field to overcome having multiple MPPs. In [21,22], a hybrid and in [23,24], modified P&O methods are suggested to improve the effectiveness of the MPPT algorithm in a variety of environmental circumstances. An FLC-based algorithm is developed in [25] to improve MPPT efficiency. In [26], a self-adapted InC algorithm with high dynamic and steady- state performance is given for different operating points on the P–V characteristics. A modified InC algorithm stated in [27] eliminates some drawbacks of conventional InC. In [28–31], the enhanced PSO algorithms are given to improve their accuracy under PSC.
In the references given so far, the PSCs are only exemplified in a few cases, and also the proposed algorithms are not tested under changing panel connection types. On the other hand, the following studies present more comprehensive cases in terms of the algorithm, connection type and PSC. For instance, In [32], 132 PV panels are used with different partial shading patterns to test the enhanced PSO algorithm. In [33], the PSCs are formed with 4 partial shadings patterns and for 3 different PV panels to test the optimal PSO parameters. In [34], a fully adaptive PSO algorithm is developed and tested under the PSC that includes 10 × 5 PV panels and only one connection type in simulation and 3 PV panels for experimental studies. In [35], an analysis of the proposed PSO algorithm under PSC is given for a few PV array characteristics. With a new connection method named magic square, [36] uses 5 × 5 PV panels and 6 shading patterns in simulation studies to compare the proposed connection method without assessing any algorithm. Similarly, [37] analyzes the effectiveness of the different connection types in various PSCs using simulation results. As seen above literature review, the studies mainly focus on either improving an MPPT algorithm or connection type. This situation has caused the problem of which MPPT algorithm should be used together with which connection type, according to the partial shading patterns that the power plant will be exposed to during the installation of PV power plants. In the literature, a study to analyze the effectiveness of a PV plant by considering the combination of MPPT algorithms, partial shading patterns and connection types has yet to be found.
Inspired by the above discussions, in this study, for a 5 × 5 PV array
using 6 different shading conditions and 8 different connection types together, the basic forms of three mostly preferred algorithms P&O, InC and PSO are executed in Processor-In-The-Loop (PIL) platform. Moreover, the impact of the connection types on the efficiency of the MPPT system considered with different partial shading patterns
according to the Fill Factor (𝐹𝐹 ), Mismatched Loss (𝑀𝐿), and Effi-
ciency (𝜂) performance criteria is also analyzed. The key advancements
outlined in this paper can be succinctly summarized as follows; (1)
the conventional MPPT algorithms can achieve a high success rate in reaching MPP by selecting the appropriate panel connection type according to the shading pattern to be exposed, (2) the DG shading pattern may not pose a severe problem for the power efficiency of the PV system, (3) under the LW and DG shading pattern, the algorithm and connection type to be selected for the PV system has almost no effect on the system performance. As a result, the proposed system reveals

the importance of considering the MPPT algorithm, connection types and partial shading patterns altogether for the power efficiency and complexity of PV power plants to be installed.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows; An MPPT system structure and modeling are given in Section 2. The principles of the three algorithms and details are provided in Section 3. Section 4 intro- duces the eight connection types and five shading patterns with their
P–V characteristics, 𝐹𝐹 , 𝑀𝐿, and efficiency (𝜂) criteria. In Section 5,

according to the shading patterns and connection types. The results obtained by the PIL system and remarks on the study are also listed in this section. Finally, the conclusion of this work is briefly given in Section 6.

System description and modeling

In a PV system, the power produced by the array is transferred to the load unit, grid, or other equipment using a power converter to set the voltage and current at the PV array’s output to the appropriate level. To stabilize the load voltage, a DC–DC converter, which is one of the most popular power converters used in MPPT systems, is placed in between the PV array and the load. The output voltage of the PV array is boosted in this study to form an MPPT system using a DC– DC boost-type converter. Fig. 1 provides the general block diagram
of the designed MPPT system. As seen in Fig. 1, the 𝐶𝑖𝑛 capacitor is
located near the PV array’s output to smooth the PV output voltage.

voltage of the PV array. The model can be reconfigured in this case as in Eq. (6).
When a PSC occurs in 𝑁𝑠 × 𝑁𝑝 PV array, the shaded module
generates a current less than the ones without shades; therefore, the
shaded panel output voltage would be negative where the shaded panel behaves as if it is a load. This results in a decreased system efficiency and hotspot effect on the panel, which may damage it. To solve this issue, the PV panels are connected in parallel with a bypass diode under partial shading conditions (PSCs), as shown in Fig. 3. As a result, in the characteristics of the PV array, multiple MPPs occur, making it difficult to detect global ones in the MPPT algorithm.

The MPPT algorithm calculates the duty ratio using the sensed PV array output voltage and current, as shown in Fig. 1. The power produced by the PV array should be transferred to the load at the
converter output using the maximum power of the calculated 𝑑. To
do this, the PV array impedance at the maximum power point should
match the load value. Using Eq. (1), the relationship between the impedance of the load and the PV array is given in Eq. (4), where
𝐼𝑃 𝑉 ,𝑀𝑃𝑃 and 𝑉𝑃 𝑉 ,𝑀𝑃𝑃 are the current and voltage of the PV array at
the MPP, respectively. According to this equation and the PV panel
characteristics (which will be given later), the impedance at the load is
calculated as 40 Ω.

Principles of the MPPT algorithms

The employed algorithm in the MPPT system has an essential role in the PV system efficiency. Especially under different PCSs and con- nection types, its performance may differ. Therefore, in this study, the three most widely preferred MPPT algorithms are put in perspective, as mentioned in Section 1. Being one of them, the P&O algorithm perturbs the operating voltage of the PV array and observes the output power until reaching the MPP of the array. The algorithm uses the
measured PV array output voltage (𝑉𝑘) and current (𝐼𝑘) to calculate

the instantaneous power (𝑃𝑘) for each time step (𝑘). The change in the
power (𝛥𝑃 ) is calculated by comparing instantaneous power with the previous power value (𝑃𝑘 −1). And also, the change in the voltage (𝛥𝑉 ) is calculated with its previous value (𝑉𝑘 − 1). And then, as shown in

For a PV-MPPT system, the I–V and P–V characteristics of the PV panel are essential to perceive the MPPs of the system. These characteristics are obtained with the modeling of the PV panel. In the literature, the circuit model of a PV panel can be found with the

Partial shading patterns

In a PV system, the PSC can seriously decrease the overall system power depending on the shading pattern that will occur. Therefore, the partial shading problem should be evaluated with many different patterns that can simulate the real environmental condition of the PV array. For this purpose, six different patterns, which are the Unshaded (US), Short Narrow (SN), Short Wide (SW), Long Wide (LW), Long Narrow (LN), and Diagonal (DG) patterns, are considered in the PV system that has 25 identical PV panels (parameters can be seen in Table 2) in this work. These panels are in a matrix form with 5 rows and 5 columns. It means 5 panels are used in a row, and the system has 5
columns. The location of a panel is stated as (𝑖, 𝑘), where 𝑖 represents the
row number, and 𝑘 represents the column number. When all panels are

on the applications. Therefore, there should be a good balance between these parameters [42,43]. In the literature, many ways to determine the PSO parameters can be found, which are population size, number
of iterations (𝑁𝐼 ), trust parameters, inertia weight, etc. They have
different effectiveness and performance under the selected PV panel connection type and the partial shading pattern in the MPPT system. In this study, a basic form of the PSO algorithm is employed, illustrated in the flow chart shown in Fig. 4(c). The parameters for this algorithm
are set as 𝑐1 = 𝑐2 = 2, 𝑤 = 0.2, 𝑁𝑃 = 3, and 𝑁𝐼 = 300. The flow charts
given in Fig. 4 constitute the conventional type of algorithm, while many advanced and optimized versions that are not within the scope of this study can be found in the literature. Consequently, the results of this study will guide the reader to search or enhance the algorithm selected for the particular connection type and partial shading pattern in a PV system.

Configuration of PV array

In an MPPT approach used in the PV system, the ability of the system to detect and converge MPP should be tested under different partial shading patterns and connection types because the efficiency of the system differs not only with the employed MPPT algorithm but also with partial shading patterns and connection types. Therefore, six partial shading patterns and eight connection types, which are mostly considered in a PV system, will be considered in this section.
in Fig. 5(e), where the 𝑃𝑑,𝑚𝑎𝑥 value of the array is 4820.48 W. In the
Fig. 5(f). In this shading pattern, the 𝑃𝑑,𝑚𝑎𝑥 value of the array is 4906.56 DG pattern, only the diagonally located panels are shaded, as seen in
W. With the given 𝑃𝑑,𝑚𝑎𝑥 values, it is clear that the partial shading
pattern causes the different 𝑃𝑑,𝑚𝑎𝑥 values. However, the output power of the array may significantly deviate from the 𝑃𝑑,𝑚𝑎𝑥 value according
to its connection type.

Connection types

In the PV array installation process, the panel connection type is generally decided according to the required PV array output voltage and power, with the most known options: series and parallel connec- tions. However, with this approach, the assessment of the efficiency of the whole system under different PSCs and/or with different MPPT algorithms is omitted. Therefore, the most known PV array connection types, which are given in Fig. 6 as the Series Parallel (SP), Bridge Link (BL), Honey Comb-Total Cross Tied (HC-TCT), Bridge Link-Total Cross Tied (BL-TCT), Series Parallel-Total Cross Tied (SP-TCT), Honey Comb (HC), Total Cross Tied (TCT), and Bridge Link-Honey Comb (BL- HC) will be examined in this section. Four of the connection types can be considered the basic connection types, while the others can be considered as their hybrid variants.
With a simple structure and easy-to-implement advantages, the widely used connection type SP is formed by connecting a series of all panels in a column with each other and connecting parallel each column as in Fig. 6(a). The high number of panels connected in series makes the SP connection perform poorly, especially under PSCs. In this

the array output current. Therefore, with uniform 𝐼𝐿 conditions in the each panel in a column, and the sum of the currents in each row gives
SP connection, the output voltage and current are equal to the total voltage of the panels in a column and the total current of the panels in
a row [44,45]. The array power (𝑃𝑎,𝑟) can be calculated as 25𝑉𝑐 𝐼𝑟 using
Eq. (10), where 𝑉𝑐 is the panel output voltage in a column, and 𝐼𝑟 is

each other. Then, all the bridges are crossly connected, as shown in Fig. 6(c). This type of connection includes more series connections as opposed to TCT and fewer compared to SP; therefore, the performance of PSC is better than SP and worse than TCT [44,45]. Under uniform
𝐼𝐿 conditions, the array output power of this type can be calculated as
25𝑉𝑐 𝐼𝑟 using Eq. (10).
The HC connection type inspires the hexagonal structure of the
honey bee house. As shown in Fig. 6(d), this type includes more series connections as opposed to BL and TCT and fewer compared to SP; therefore, the PSC performance of it is better than SP and worse than

In the TCT connection, all panels in a row are connected in parallel
with each other in that row, and a row is connected in series with the next row. This cross-connection, as in Fig. 6(b), increases the com-

The BL connection type is derived from the TCT and SP types overcoming the disadvantage of requiring more wiring. Unfavorably, it has low performance under PSCs because of reduced array output voltage. This connection type is obtained by forming four panels as a bridge rectifier unit, where two of the four PV panels are connected in series, and the attained two groups are connected in parallel with

As for the efficiency under PSCs, these connection types have very different characteristics because the current paths in every row and every column will differ according to the partial shading pattern.

pattern, respectively. Differing from these connection types, only the SP-TCT connection type has its maximum output power under the SN pattern. The output power of the SP-TCT type under SN, LN and DG conditions are very close to each other.
Apart from the P–V characteristics curves, the performance of the connection types is also assessed with the calculation of the Fill Factor

array in any connection type indicates the power differences between
standard test conditions and PSC. It is calculated as in Eq. (12), where
𝐺𝑀𝑃 (𝑆) is the 𝐺𝑀𝑃  value under standard test conditions, and 𝐺𝑀𝑃 (𝑃 ) is the 𝐺𝑀𝑃 value under PSC. Another criterion for the effectiveness is the Fill Factor that can be calculated as in Eq. (13), where 𝑉𝑂𝐶 and 𝐼𝑆𝐶

PIL results and performance evaluation

To assess the effectiveness of the three distinct MPPT algorithms and connection types under a variety of partial shading circumstances, the proposed MPPT-based PV power plant system is developed utilizing the PIL (Processor-In-The-Loop) platform. In the PIL-based MPPT system, unlike a regular simulation, the power stage is simulated in the soft- ware, whereas the algorithm is verified digitally in the hardware target microprocessor. Therefore, the algorithm in the PIL implementation can be tested in a real-time DSP with the C/C++ language.
In this work, to create six different PV array shading patterns in PSIM® software, 25 Kyocera solar KD215GX PV panels are exposed to corresponding irradiation levels, given in Fig. 5, for each connection type shown in Fig. 6. At the output of the PV array, the designed DC–DC boost converter is employed to boost the PV array voltage level to the appropriate level for the load. In this way, the power stage of the system for different shading patterns and connection types is created in the software. On the other hand, the three MPPT algorithms are executed by the TMS320F28335 DSP evaluation board. As seen in Fig. 8, the DSP receives the PV array voltage and current measurements via JTAG communication and the USB cable connected between the PC and the DSP kit. Then, the MPPT algorithm calculates the duty ratio and is sent back to the simulated converter. In this way, to demonstrate the performance of the P&O, InC, and PSO algorithms outlined in Section 3, as well as the effectiveness of the connection types, these algorithms are executed by the TMS320F28335 DSP evaluation board for all eight connection types under six different shading patterns.
In Table 5, the PIL-based results are given, which categorize the measured output power of the system as the local or global maximum in accordance with the GMPs and LMPs data given in Table 3. As can be seen there, the PSO algorithm achieves finding the global maximum point of 45 out of 48 P–V characteristics, which means it has a success rate of 93.75%. It sticks to the local maximum power of the HC and SP connections under the SN shading pattern and of the SP connection under the LW shading pattern. These fails of the PSO arise from the fact that the GMP and LMP of the HC connection type under the SN pattern and of the SP connection type under the LW pattern are very
close to each other (the difference is only 7 W and 11 W, respectively).
Conversely, this success rate is around 33.33% and 31.25% for the InC
and P&O algorithms, respectively. They fail with all connection types under the SW shading pattern to reach the global maximum point. Under this shading pattern, the maximum loss due to the conventional
algorithms occurs in SP connection with 79 W, as shown in Table 5,
of 959 W under the LN shading pattern with the SP connection. The whose numerical values are given in Table 3. This loss has a peak value
detailed findings and remarks are listed below.

Among the five shading patterns, all connection types have maxi- mum power under the DG pattern (excluding the SP-TCT connec- tion). Also, all connection types have their minimum ML under this pattern (excluding SP-TCT connection). Correlatively, the FF of all connection types (excluding SP-TCT connection) reaches their maximum under the DG pattern. Therefore, the DG shading pattern may not pose a severe problem for the power efficiency
of the system. However, the efficiency (𝜂) of all connection types
has the highest value under the LW pattern.
If the connection type of a PV system is selected according to the shading pattern, the performance of the system using the simplest form of conventional algorithms can perform as high as the system using a complex one. For instance, under the SN
shading pattern, if one of the BL-HC, BL-TCT, TCT, and SP-TCT connection types is employed, the performance of the system will be the same for the conventional and complex algorithms. Similarly, using one of the BL, BL-TCT, HC-TCT, TCT, and SP- TCT connection types will result in the same situation under the LN pattern.
For the PV system, the employed MPPT algorithm significantly af-
fects the reaching point in the P–V characteristics of the PV array for various connection types and shading patterns. Therefore, to test the performance of an MPPT algorithm, not only the different connection types or shading patterns but also both should be used together.



Among the tested algorithms, the PSO reaches the GMP of the P–V characteristics under almost all tested shading patterns and connection types. However, it fails in the HC connection under the SN shading pattern and in the SP connection under the LW shading pattern because their global and local maximum points are very close. Therefore, if a PSO algorithm is employed and it is required to reach the GMPs under all shading patterns and connection types, an enhanced/improved or hybrid version of the algorithm should be developed or adapted.
Though the conventional algorithms reach fewer global points than the PSO in all given conditions, they have almost the same performance as PSO under the LW and DG patterns with all connection types. Therefore, if the shading patterns are predicted to be LW and DG, the employed algorithm and the type of connection will not make a difference. In this case, the lowest- cost connection type and the lowest-complexity algorithm can be used.
Under the SW shading pattern, it is crucial to use the PSO al-
gorithm, as the global maximum point cannot be reached by conventional methods with all connection types. Additionally, if an algorithm that can reach the GMP is employed, the type of connection will not make a difference because the GMP of all connections has the same value under this pattern.

Conclusion

This paper has detailly analyzed the performance of a PV power plant consisting of a 5 × 5 PV array according to the MPPT algorithm, connection type, and shading pattern with the TMS320F28335 DSP kit- based Processor-In-The-Loop (PIL) platform. The effectiveness of the SP, TCT, HC, BL, SP-TCT, BL-TCT, BL-HC, and HC-TCT connection types
are investigated with the parameters ML, FF and efficiency (𝜂) under
different shading patterns. With these criteria, the TCT-type connection
exhibits better performance than the others under the SN, SW, LN, LW, and DG shading patterns. It reaches its peak output power under the diagonal (DG) shading patterns. Also, it has a maximum Fill Factor (FF) of 65.73% and a minimum Mismatch Power Loss (ML) of 10.40%. The used connection types and shading patterns make it possible to widely evaluate the performance of the employed PSO, P&O, and InC algorithms. The results of the algorithms show that the PSO algorithm has superior performance as expected among the other algorithms to reach the global maximum point of the P–V curve under different connection types and shading patterns. However, in 3 of 48 test cases, the PSO algorithm fails, which means that the enhanced version of it should be employed when a 100% success rate is expected. On the other hand, in 35 of 48 cases, the three algorithms perform similarly; therefore, a complicated MPPT algorithm may not be required in the majority of the shading patterns by choosing an appropriate connection type. Additionally, the proposed system can be used to assess the performance of any MPPT algorithm and also be used to decide the algorithm and connection type of any PV power plant to be installed.
