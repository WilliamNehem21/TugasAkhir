The new analogs of benzimidazole fused heterocyclic compounds such as triazinane and oxadiazinanes were synthesised by classical amino methylation with different aryl-N,N0 unsymmetrical thioureas. The antibacterial activity of triazinane and oxadiazinane compounds have been assessed with zone of inhibi- tion by well diffusion method using a panel of selected gram positive and gram negative bacterial strains and which have showed good activity. The synthesised molecules were subjected to molecular docking studies with two proteins, namely topoisomerase II (PDB ID: 1JIJ) and DNA gyrase subunit b (PDB ID: 1KZN). The molecular docking studies are supporting the antibacterial activity exhibiting high inhibition constant and binding energy.

Introduction

The organic compounds specifically with N-heterocyclic ring systems exhibit a wide range of biological activities through effec- tive binding to enzyme receptor site. As per the present global sce- nario, thousands of new heterocyclic compounds either isolated from natural sources or synthesized in the laboratories are added to the literature every year. Many of these compounds have drawn the attention of researchers based on their biological, therapeutic and industrial potential.
Benzimidazoles are found to be useful intermediates for the development of new molecules of biological or pharmaceutical interest. Substituted benzimidazole derivatives have been found to possess Biological activities such as antitumor [1], antimicrobial [2], anthelmintic [3], antibacterial [4], analgesic [5], anti inflamma- tory [6] etc. In recent times, new techniques have been adopted for the efficient synthesis of novel heterocycles by using heteroge- neous, nano-catalysts and photocatalysis that are highly and eco- friendly [7–13]. Triazinane derivatives belonging to nitrogen heterocycles have greatest importance due to their potential appli- cations. These have been identified as commercial products which are used as H2S scavengers in the areas with relatively low concen-

trations of H2S and it is inexpensive to use. The products of the scavenging reactions are believed to be biodegradable and water soluble [14]. Little work has been published in the area of 1,3,5- triazinane-4-thiones and 1,3,5-triazinane-2-ones showing antimi- crobial activity [15]. These are also promising intermediates in the synthesis of tyrosine derivatives, which are well-known com- pounds used as Biocidal [16] and enantio-differentiating coupling reagents [17]. Heterocyclic structural unit has a significant place among pharmaceutically important synthetic and natural materi- als [18], showing powerful antiproliferative action [19]. For these reasons, 1,3,5-triazinane derivatives incorporating thiourea unit may be important in many fields [20].

Anti bacterial activity

The antibacterial activity of synthesized compounds was evalu- ated against six bacteria by using the well diffusion method. Gen- tamycin was employed as standard drug to compare the results. Strains of Bacillus subtilis MTCC 441, Bacillus cereus ATCC 9372, Sta- phylococcus aureus ATCC 96, E. coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumo- niae MTCC 109, Salmonella typhi ATCC 4420 were taken from the department of microbiology, Kakatiya University Warangal. The
bacterial cultures were developed by selective nutrient broth at 37 °C and stored at 4 °C for further use. Nutrient broth was used for the preparation of inoculums of the bacteria and nutrient agar was used for the screening method [21] and their results were tab- ulated in Table 1.

Molecular docking

Auto Dock 4.2 (MGL tools-1.5.6) was used to perform all dock- ing simulations. A set of new triazinane–benzimidazole derivatives were subjected to docking with topoisomerase II (PDB ID: 1JIJ) and DNA gyrase subunit b (PDB ID:1KZN). From the Protein Data Bank (RCSB) (http://www.rcsb.org/pdb). The DNA gyrase subunit b and crystal structure of target enzyme topoisomerase II was retrieved. To carry out in silico studies, the 2D structures of the synthesized ligands 5(a–e), 6(a–e) were drawn and converted to energy mini- mized 3D structures in the pdb file format using Marvin Sketch (Chem Axon). By removing the hetero atoms, water molecule and cofactors, the target protein file was prepared by leaving the asso- ciated residue with protein by using Auto Dock 4.2 (MGL tools- 1.5.6).

Results and discussion

In the present study, it has been discussed that the synthesis of various benzimidazole fused triazinane 4-thione heterocyclic moi- eties by cyclic condensation based on classical Mannich amino methylation of N,N' unsymmetrical thio ureas (4) with 30% HCHO and methyl amine in ethanol. An aliphatic amine has been yielded in the condensation between methyl amine and formaldehyde, it cyclizes immediately to produce corresponding 1,3,5-triazinane since imine is unstable. With respect to biological activity, benzim- idazole fused heterocyclic compounds such as triazinane deriva- tives are of very important than the cyclic compounds. Here the efforts are more focused on the synthesis of compound (1) by using NaHSO4–SiO2 catalyst and high yield of derived product is achieved by refluxing in ethanol. NaHSO4–SiO2 is a heterogeneous and eco friendly catalyst [22].
The chemical structure of title compounds 5 and 6 were estab- lished on the basis of spectroscopic analysis. The IR spectrum showed absorption bands in the range from 3355 to 3373 cm—1 for (NH) functions, 1562 to 1590 cm—1 for (C@N) function and C@S absorptions in the range from 1231 to 1277 cm—1. The 1H NMR spectra of test compounds revealed the presence of singlet signals at 6.38 ppm for thiazole protons (CH), 11.20 ppm for NH proton, 4.64 ppm for CH2 (triazinane) and 5.53 ppm CH2 (oxadiaz- inane) respectively in addition to the aromatic protons as a multi- plet (H) in the range 6.78–8.40 ppm. The mass spectrum showed a

Biological study and structure activity relationship

The newly synthesized title compounds 5a–e and 6a–e were evaluated for their antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Salmonella typhi. The antibacterial activity of the tested com- pounds was assessed by zone of inhibition using well diffusion method. Gentamycin was used as standard drug for comparison. Structure activity relationship (SAR) studies for the antibacterial activity of compounds 5a–e and 6a–e mentioned in Table 1. The results of antibacterial screening (Table 1) reveal that the com- pounds 5a–e and 6a–e displayed a better activity as compared to the standard drug. The electronic property of the compounds has close relationship to their biological activity. The substitution of the electron withdrawing groups such as chloro (5e and 6e), and nitro (5d and 6d) on the benzene ring exhibited more activity, whereas the introduction of electron donating groups such as methyl (5b and 6b) and methoxy (5c and 6c) groups on the ben- zene ring did not exhibit much activity. Compound 5a and 6a showed least activity because it has no substituent on the benzene ring. This evidence confirmed that suitable functional groups on benzene ring were necessary for better antibacterial activities in drug design [23]. Hence these results implied that electron with- drawing groups play important roles in the antibacterial activities of these tested compounds.
Molecular docking based on the fact that Vosaroxin is a benzim- idazole derivative which is an antibacterial drug and it is proved to exert its action by the inhibition of topoisomerase II, in clinical trails. On the basis of drug action, it has been performed docking simulation of the newly synthesized benzimidazole derivatives 5a–e and 6a–e binding the active site of the topoisomerase II crystal structure (PDB ID: 1JIJ) and DNA gyrase subunit b (PDB ID: 1KZN). The docking result of the tested compounds 5d and 6d showed high binding energy with topoisomerase II and DNA gyrase subunit
b. Compound 5d and 6d showed very good binding energy with
—9.05, —9.10 kcal/mol respectively for topoisomerase II. Compound 5d and 6d showed very good binding energy with —10.04, —9.37 respectively for DNA gyrase subunit b. The binding energies, inhibi- tion constants and residues involved in H-bonding are tabulated in Table 2.



Conclusions

The research study reported efficient synthesis of new analogs of triazinane and oxadiazinane by classical amino methylation with different aryl-N,N' unsymmetrical thioureas. All compounds were characterized by standard spectroscopic techniques and eval- uation of the antibacterial activity of all new compounds was car- ried out and proved significant to moderate activity also the compounds showed good inhibitory activity against molecular docking.
