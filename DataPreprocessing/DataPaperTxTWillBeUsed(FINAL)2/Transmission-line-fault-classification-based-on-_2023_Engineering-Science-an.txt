To ensure the reliability of power supply, ultra-fast and reliable fault classification of the transmission line is the critical stage of the wide-area transmission network protection. As the distributed generation (DG) current in- jection to the transmission line, the amplitude characteristic of the break current protection reduces and the system reliability decreases. With the wide-area measurement generated to the power system, an online fault classification method with the global and local discriminant analysis (GLDA) is proposed to enhance the phase characteristic and decrease calculation load. In the single line to ground (SLG) fault process, the local current phase shift is analyzed to enhance the spatiotemporal characteristic. To fully measure the ordering degree of the spatiotemporal characteristic, the axiomatic definition for the characteristic entropy (CE) of the grid impedance in the individual bus in the wide-area transmission network is proposed according to the characteristic distri- bution. Based on the current spatiotemporal characteristic analysis, a multi-priority GLDA classifies the fault phase in a coordinating way using with the phasor measurement unit (PMU). The multi-priority GLDA-CE fault classification method reduces the computational load, ensures resilience against measurement noise and the transition resistance effect. Compared with the statistical entropy and neural network method, the classification accuracy and response speed of the GLDA-CE fault classification method are validated in the IEEE 39-bus system with 10 PMUs. Compared with the conventional statistical entropy and neural network methods, the GLDA-CE method is able to classify 226 entire power outages and 600 single phase outages within 1.621 s.





Introduction

Motivation

As the high penetration of the distributed generation (DG) and flexible loads, the power electronic trend expands in the wide-area transmission network [1,2]. The long-distance transmission lines are geographically dispersed and exposed to the uncertain environment, which leads to the important change in the power system operation
[3–5]. Therefore, the wide-area transmission network is easily affected by the various high-impedance surface such as the stone, sand or asphalt
[6]. When a fault occurring in the wide-area transmission network, the fault branch isolated by the protection relay and the rest of the grid will be stressed. In the short circuit fault condition, the wide-area trans- mission network should classify the fault section and self-heal rapidly [7].
Literature review

The fault classification methods for the wide-area transmission network contain the traveling wave method, the impedance-based method and the intelligent method [8–10].
The traveling wave method computes the fault distance based on the
incident reflected traveling wave in the monitoring terminal. Wang [11] concludes that the accuracy of the traveling wave method can be further improved if detail line model is employed. Wide-area traveling-wave methods yield accurate result, while require high sample rate of mea- surements (MHz) [12]. With the lower sample rate measurement, the impedance methods can estimate fault classification using synchronized signals. The impedance-based method establishes the fault detection equation using the impedance between the fault point and the measuring terminal and detect the fault state. Sano [13] emphasizes that the simplified transmission line model is commonly accepted in the impedance-based method for the transmission network. Aiming at the

series compensated transmission line model, Ghazizadeh [14] simplifies the compensation model to derive the nonlinear current distribution matrix and classify the fault phase independent from the measurement type. To guarantee the classification accuracy, Han [15] uses a lumped transmission line model to calculate the capacitor impedance in the valid classification formula. Several model-based methods are summa- rized and the model accuracy affect the equivalent impedance directly. Wu [16] concludes that the best global performance method pro- poses a more suitable model for the transmission line, which allows the consistency correction of the calculated impedance and the nominal one to identify the fault state. Due to the generalization and efficiency, the impedance-based method achieves accurate performance in fault clas- sification for the two-terminal transmission line. The above impedance- based methods concentrate on the amplitude characteristic and the phase angle characteristic requires deeper analysis. Paladhi [17] pre- dicts the sequence current angle characteristic in the fault loop to determine the pure-fault plant impedance for fault type classification. Angela [18] characterizes the phase-angle shift characteristic associated with local voltage sags in uni-directional radial branch and illustrates the basic classification principle as a system impedance function.
Therefore, the phase-angle shift character in the single line to ground
fault needs further analysis.
To reduce the model dependence effect on the fault classification accuracy, the data-driven intelligent method is introduced to the transmission network. Recent literatures indicate that data-driven fault detection method is efficient to adapt to the transmission ystem with DGs. Mohammad [19] classifies the system operation state using the variant convolutional neural network, where the voltage amplitude signal is extracted for the regression process. In the regression process, the CNN performance is highly dependent on the mass fault training samples. For each fault type, 12 fault cases are used to train the CNN- based classifier. Shazdeh [20] extracted the current phase angle shift as distinctive features to identify the faulty section. The fault feature accuracy is improved by comparing the phasor shift in the fault process. Bai [21] extracts the fault feature of the partial discharge based on the wavelet analysis. The neural network model predicts the exact output corresponding to the fault area and discriminate from the normal tran- sient operation. Limited by the measurement synchronization [22], few works of fault classification for multi-terminal branches based on the wide-area phase angle analysis are reported. The fault classification method in this paper differs from the existing ones since the phase angle relationship between different geographical positions. The proposed method is robust to the topological structure of network, the type of fault or the DG presence, which improves the accuracy and flexibility.

Local spatial–temporal phasor characterization
Considering a random fault distance in the circuit-analysis derived model, the relationship between the voltage phase angle shift at two arbitrary points of long-distance transmission line can be estimated. By phase analysis in the dynamic process, the phasor shift relation between voltage and current angles is used to characterize the synchronization signal sags in the fault position. The nonlinear characteristic model for the active power flow in a transmission branch is established by stages, which is described by the hyperbolic tangent function. Since the char- acteristic model is nonlinear and identified by the entropy index to measure the characteristic matrix consistency.

Spatiotemporal characteristic analysis of the adjacent current

To illustrate the basic principle of the impedance classification method, a equivalent circuit model of the medium-length transmission line is illustrated in Fig. 1. Considering a single line to ground (SLG) fault at fault position f along the random transmission line i-j, the fault point divides the line section into two segments, which is modeled by the distributed parameter line model.

Characteristic entropy

The nonlinear characteristic model extracts the non-stationary fault characteristic using PMU sensor. In view of the thermodynamics en- tropy, information entropy was propounded to evaluate the system consistency [23–25]. Entropy has the following properties:
The entropy method quantifies the pattern similarity degree in the
time series and measures the signal consistency, which is robust to measurement noise and shows well tolerance for the transient interference;
f is

ep,n+1(t + 1) = — λp,n+1(t + 1)ln(λp,n+1(t + 1))	(12) The discrete entropy characteristic e(t + 1) quantifies the charac- teristic consistency. The ordered system contains the lower entropy.
When the probability mass concentrates at a single point, the entropy
identified as the minimum entropy e(t + 1, df). Based on the minimum minimum value in the Dirac delta distribution. Then, the fault phase is search, the GLDA-CE method can identify the fault phase quantitatively
and directly, which simplifies the training process of the artificial in- telligence algorithms.

Multi-priority GLDA-CE fault classification framework

The distributed fault classification strategy contains two stages. First, in the wide area PMU monitor system, the potential fault section is estimated based on the detection criteria. Then, in the potential fault terminal, the voltage and current phase signals are predicted and the fault phase is identified based on the classification criteria.

the fault branch. Then, the i-j fault branch is diagnosed as the minimum characteristic entropy in Fig. 3.

Distributed fault classification criteria

The potential fault branch obtains the higher priority of the classi- fication research based on the above fault detection result. The PMU sensors track the voltage phasors form the two terminals of the potential fault branch i-j. The phase angle relationship between the phase angle of the fault current can be expressed in hyperbolic tangent functions and

tance has weak influence on the GLDA-CE classification accuracy.
Instead of analyzing the operating state at each bus, the GLDA-CE fault classification method first estimates the fault branch based on the spatiotemporal characteristic analysis to reduce the observation space dimension. Then GLDA-CE fault classification method measures the spatiotemporal order degree using the local PMU-measured data to identify the fault phase. Thus, in the wide area transmission and trans- mission network, the multi-priority fault classification strategy can achieve second-level response in Fig. 4.
Results and discussion

Characteristic extraction in time domain

To verify the efficiency of GLDA-CE fault classification method, the fault detection tests are operated in the 12.66-kV IEEE 39-bus system [29–31] includes 39 buses, 43 branches, and 10 DGs. The PMU sensors
installed position based on the observer criteria [32,33] is shown in
Fig. 5: 24, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39 bus.
The characteristic extraction is analyzed in the SLG fault scenario. Supposing that a C-phase to ground fault occurs at 82.530% from bus 16
(i = 16, j = 24, df = 0.8253) in branch 16–24 bus. The transient fault
occurs at 0.65 s and is cleared at the 0.66 s. The transmission branch of
of  15.43  MVA  and  fault  resistance  Zn+1  =  30  Ω. 16–24 bus is modeled with a total line length of 10 km, the load demand

Evolution of real-time power amplitude in time domain
In the IEEE-39 power system, an C-phase to ground fault occurs in the 16–24 branch. The voltage and current signals are analyzed at different measurement noise level in Fig. 6. The voltage and current
signals of bus 24 containing white Gaussian noise, where SNR = 30 dB
and 35 dB in the dynamic fault progress. In Fig. 6(a), the 35 dB noise
signal affects the magnitude of current and voltage at 1.861%. In Fig. 6
(b) the 30 dB noise signal affect the magnitude at 4.352%.

Spatiotemporal characteristic analysis of the adjacent current
The fault characteristic φ16 in the 16–24 branch is shown in Fig. 7. In the normal operation progress (0–0.65 s), the φ16c remains at 1.290. In
within 0.04 s while φ16A and φ16B maintain the normal state(φ16A = the fault initial stage, the fault characteristic φ24c increase to 7.031 1.599 and φ16B = 0.741). In the high-resistance fault scenario, the cur-
rent magnitude signal of the fault transmission branch changes slightly
1.893%. The fault current flow direction in the fault branch changes more significantly, which is measured by the characteristic signals of the phased angle. Based on phase angle analysis, the proposed characteristic model can extract the transient sag and represent the dynamic behavior of the high-resistance fault in the power line.
Spatiotemporal analysis of fault classification

Global global inter-domain fault detection
To verify the detection efficiency, based on the detection criteria, the CE vector ei for the transmission network is calculated in Fig. 8. In Fig. 8, e16 is 0.242 and e24 is 0.203, which detects a fault in branch 16–24. The
characteristic entropy e16 and e24 decrease significantly comparing with
the nearby buses, which corresponds to that only the characteristic vector of the fault branch is well ordered while the normal bus is disorder.

Analysis of fault classification at different SNR level
In the SLG fault scenario of Fig. 7, the corresponding detection result
confidence interval e16C = [0.005, 0.018] in the normal state. In stage 2, a SLG fault occurs in phase C (branch 16–24) at 0.65 s (SINR = 20 dB) r24 is analyzed in Figs. 9 and 10. In Fig. 10(a) (stage 1), the residual and e16C = [0.057, 0.083] with the confidence level 99.00%. In stage 4, the restoration relay acts at 0.95 s (SINR = 30 dB) and e16C = [1.218, 1.374] with the confidence level 97.323% and the response time tCE =
0.02 s.

Composition analysis at different transition resistance
Assuming that a C-phase to ground fault occurs at the 20% distance from bus 24 in the 16–24 branch; the fault occurs at 1 s and is cleared at
3 s; fault resistance Zn+1 range [0.1, 30].
The synchronized detection result at bus 16 in the dynamic fault
process is shown in Fig. 11. In the health state, the CE curves e16 maintain to 1.252 and fluctuate slightly. At the fault initial process, the CE curves e16 decreases 94.449% in 0.65 s.
In Fig. 11, the entropy e16-0.1 drops to 0.048 in 0.02 s (Zn+1 = 0.1 Ω); e16-1 drops to 0.062 in 0.12 s (Zn+1 = 1 Ω); e16-5 drops to 0.091 in 0.16 s (Zn+1 = 5 Ω); e16-10 drops to 0.146 in 0.20 s (Zn+1 = 10 Ω); e16-30 drops to
0.313 in 0.24 s (Zn+1 = 30 Ω). The characteristic entropy e16 increases
slightly as the fault resistance increases, which below the threshold 0.6.
In the 600 test cases, the detection accuracy is 99.667% and the respond time is within 0.1 s.
In order to test the effect of DG penetration level, five groups of groups of simulation tests are conducted in 16–24 branch. The detection errors of the proposed GLDA-CE fault classification method are shown
with the increasing DG penetration level in Fig. 12. For this case, the proposed GLDA-CE method exhibits an increasing detection error trend as the DG penetration level increases, reaching an average error of 0.0412 for a penetration level of 25%. This behavior is due to the increasing penetration, which increases the error of voltage signal U16 contributed to the training sets of the transmission systems.

Based on the detection criteria, the characteristic-based method analyzes the consistency of fault characteristics, which is independent of the magnitude signal. The GLDA-CE detection method can monitor the wide-area power system synchronously in both low resistance and high resistance fault process.

Computational effectiveness analysis
To analyze the method sensitivity, the fault resistance effect on the path of grounding oscillatory circuit is considered. In Table 1, the classification accuracy and respond time evaluate the classification performance of the GLDA-CE classification method comparing with the nearest neighbor clustering (NNC) method [34], regularized radial basis neural network (RRBF) [35] and wavelet neural network (WNN) [36] method. The average classification false alarm rate rGLDA-CE is 1.385%, which decreases 2.411% of rINNC. Meanwhile, the classification false

higher (rRRBF = 11.821%, rWNN = 13.385%), which leads to mis- alarm rate of the artificial neural network (ANN) methods are much judgments. Therefore, the GLDA-CE classification method shows the
lowest classification error.
In Table 2, the response time t of the GLDA-CE, INNC, RRBF and WNN method are compared. Due to the proposed method extracts the fault characteristic from the ADN system essentially and identify the fault phase based on the classification model synchronously, the GLDA- CE respond time tGLDA-CE is 1.273 s, which is far below the ANN methods. Different from the ANN methods, the GLDA-CE method is independent from the complex calculation and training process. In the impedance method, the classification accuracy depends on the iterations of the matching degree and affects the classification response time directly. Therefore, the proposed GLDA-CE classification method can extract the fault characteristic from measurement noise interference clearly and improves the search efficiency.

Conclusion

A novel fault classification method based on the spatiotemporal characteristic analysis for the wide-area transmission network is pro- posed in this paper. The transient spatiotemporal characteristic of the fault current is extracted in the dynamic progress. The fault classifica- tion criteria quantifies the order degree of the spatiotemporal charac- teristic. The characteristic enhancement and the coordinating identification framework confirm that the GLDA-CE fault classification method obtains the high generalization capability in the measurement noise and fault resistance effect. The hierarchical classification strategy reduces the fault search zone and decreases the respond time. Therefore, the GLDA-CE fault classification method obtains the classification ac- curacy 92.414% and the fast respond time 1.274 s compared with the WNN, RRBF and INNC method. The GLDA-CE fault classification method can monitor the power system synchronously and lays the foundation for the transmission system restoration.
