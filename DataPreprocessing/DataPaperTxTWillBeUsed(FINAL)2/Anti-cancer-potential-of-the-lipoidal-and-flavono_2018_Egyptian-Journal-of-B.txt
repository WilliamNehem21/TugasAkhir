For a long time, plant secondary metabolites have been strongly examined for their antitumor and cytotoxic impacts. These days, there is another pattern of making utilization of the waste products of plants because of their extravagance of numerous phytochemical components and adequacy on human wellbeing. This research work is handling the effect of diversity of lipoidal and phenolic compounds found in the peels of two common edible plants in the Middle East; Pisum sativum and Vicia faba L. for their assesment as anticancer agents. The GC/MS of the n-hexane extract of both plant peels led to identification of twenty compounds (82.99%) and seventeen compounds (85.97%) of the total lipoidal contents from P. sativum and V. faba, respectively. While the HPLC analysis of the ethyl acetate fraction of the two plant peels resulted in recognition of 17 flavonoids and 18 phenolics from P. sativum and 16 flavonoids and 17 phenolics from V. faba. Moreover, four flavonoidal compounds were isolated to our knowledge for the first time from the peels and tested separately against different human cancer cell lines and the mode of action of the most potent compound has been determined. P. sativum ethyl acetate fraction possessed the highest scavenging activity (31.2%) as well as the most cytotoxic effect on breast carcinoma cell line. Apigenin proved to be the most potent tested compound on (MCF-7) and has no cytotoxic effect on normal human skin cell lines.

Introduction

Peels of vegetables and fruits are frequently tossed or used to feed the livestock and as fertilizers. These wastes are profoundly inclined to microbial spoilage and thusly create significant issues to the environment. So that, these wastes ought to be figured out how to be used advantageously. Nowadays, many studies are performed to utilize these wastes to reduce the environmental pollution and get some medicinal benefits [1]. Where fruit peels are an important source of bioactive compounds mainly as anti- oxidant and anticancer agents against colon, prostate and breast cancers [2]. Therefore, it is necessary to unveil the biological activities of these peels and take the benefits from their waste materials, in addition to investigate their chemical composition to encourage adequate reuse of these wastes for several applica- tions in the medicine [3].
It has turned out to be certain that tumor is the principle driving reason for death in developed countries as well as developing countries. Mankind has been struggling with great efforts to get improved and discover cheaper treatments with fewer drawbacks

to decrease the commonness of this disease and its resulting mor- tality. Legumes are well known of being rich in many bioactive non-nutrient components (phytochemicals) alongside their nutri- tional valued compounds (protein, carbohydrates, dietary fibers, and vitamins). Both plants under study belong to family Fabaceae. Pisum sativum L. is commonly known as the green pea or garden pea. In 2002, Troszynhska et al. [4] proved that the acetone extract of the seed coat has antibacterial, antidiabetic, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, antihypercholesterolemic, antioxidant and anticancer properties. The HPLC analysis of the phenolic com- pounds in the same study showed the presence of some phenolic acids (benzoic, cinnamic acids, and their derivatives as well as some flavonoids (apigenin-7-glucoside, quercetin-3-rhamnoside, kaempferol-3- glucoside as well as other flavonoids). On the other hand, Vicia faba L. is among the oldest plant in the world [5], and considered an essential source of protein and energy as it is rich in a large amount of amino acids [6], also a potent source of levodopa; a precursor of dopamine, so that, it can be used for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease [5].
The present study focused on phytochemical evaluation of lipoi- dal and phenolic extracts in the peels of Pisum sativum L. and Vicia faba L. for their assesment as anticancer agents.

Materials and methods

Material for phytochemical study

Plant material
The fresh fruits of both Pisum sativum and Vicia faba were col- lected from local markets in Cairo, Egypt in February 2016. Each species was peeled off; the peels were dried in shades, then grinded and kept in sealed bags.

Preparation of the extracts
The dried powdered peels of P. sativum and V. faba were sepa- rately defatted with n-hexane then extracted with ethyl acetate several times.
The obtained four extracts were concentrated under reduced pressure at 45 °C using the rotary evaporator to 1/10th of the initial volume and kept in refrigerator for the further studies.

Chemicals and reagents
All the chemicals and reagents were of analytical grade and pur- chased from Merck.

GC/MS analysis of the lipoidal extracts
The n-hexane extract of both plant peels were analyzed using GC/MS technique for identification of sterols, terpenes and fatty acid methyl esters.

HPLC determination of phenolics and flavonoids
High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using Agilent Technologies 1100 series liquid chromatograph coupled with an auto sampler and a diode-array detector was performed for the identification and quantification of flavonoids and phenolics in the ethyl acetate fraction of P. sativum and V. faba according to
[7] and [8].

Screening of phenolics and flavonoids
The initial screening for the ethyl acetate fractions of both plants was carried out separately with the basic qualitative test for flavonoids, where 0.5 ml of the extract was mixed with 2 ml of conc. H2SO4 and few magnesium turnings. Further, Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) of the fraction was carried out using the solvent system chloroform–methanol (90: 10 v/v). In the TLC screening procedure, a thin strip of 3x10 cm of TLC Silica Plate (Sil- ica gel 60 F254, Merck), was taken and impregnated with the fine drop of fraction. The plate was then air dried and kept for the development in chromatographic chamber containing10ml of the prepared solvent system. After the successful development, the plate was examined under the UVChamber at 254 and 366 nm. The presence of flavonoid constituents was confirmed by spraying with 1% ethanolic solution of AlCl3 [9].

Isolation and purification of flavonoids
The developing of the ethyl acetate fractions of both species was carried out separately on preparative TLC using Chloroform– methanol (90:10 v/v) as developing system. The plates were exam- ined under the UV light at 254 and 366 nm, resp. [10] and [11], and subjected to AlCl3 solution. The selected bands marked and scratched then collected. The Rf values of the isolated compounds were recorded and co-chromatographed against the available authentic flavonoids for the confirmation of the isolated com- pounds at the same Rf. the isolated compounds were identified by different spectral analyses (UV, H1-NMR, IR and MS spectrometry).
Determination of melting point and different Spectral Analyses: Koffler’s heating stage microscope was used to determine the
melting point, UV–Visible Spectrophotometer double beam UVD– 3500 spectrophotometer, Labomed, Inc., Visible Spectrophotome- ter, Shimadzu UV 240 (PIN 204-58000) (Japane), Infrared spec- trophotometer, Perkin-Elmer 283 (Germany), Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectrometers JEOL EX-270 MHz, 300 MHz and 500 MHz for determination of H1-NMR, Mass spectrometer; Finni- gan Model 3200 at 70 eV.

Results

GC/MS analysis of the lipoidal extracts

GC/MS analysis of the n-hexane extracts of P. sativum and V. faba was performed, and identification of the constituents was car- ried out by comparison of their spectral fragmentation patterns with those of the available database libraries Wiley (Wiley Int.) USA and NIST (Nat. Inst. St. Technol., USA)] and/or published data in Adams [19] using Aglient 6890, 70 eV with positive ion mode. Quantitative determination was carried out based on peak area integration. The identified components are compiled in Tables 1 and 2.Twenty compounds were identified from the lipoidal matter of P. sativum, representing 82.99% of the total content from which 2, 2-dimethyl-1-(2,4,6 trimethylphenyl) was the major compound (12.56%) followed by 6-Phenylundecane (12.18%). Nevertheless, seventeen compounds were identified from V. faba representing 85.97% of the total lipoidal content, 5-phenylundecane was identi- fied as the main compound of V. faba (23.24%) followed by 2 (Ben- zoyloxy) cycloheptanone (12.74%).

Identification and quantification of phenolics and flavonoids

Tables 3 and 4 summarize the results of HPLC analysis of the ethyl acetate fraction of both plant peels. The total identified flavo- noids from P. Sativum were 17 compounds representing 19.31 mg/

Results of antioxidant and cytotoxic study

Free radical scavenging activity

The four extracts showed weak scavenging activity of DPPH● where P. sativum ethyl acetate fraction possessed the highest scav-
enging activity (31.2%) followed by V. faba ethyl acetate fraction (9.8%) as showed in Fig. 1.

Cytotoxic study of the four extracts

The four extracts were preliminary screening at 100 ppm for their antiproliferative effect using two human tumor cell lines [hu- man breast carcinoma (MCF-7), human colon carcinoma (HCT- 116)]. P. sativum ethyl acetate fraction showed high activity over breast cancer cell line with 73.6% and low activity over colon tumor cell line (HCT-116) with 21% while P. sativum n-hexane extract exhibited 26.1, 28.3 on both cell lines, resp. On the other hand V. faba n-hexane extract gave 40.2 and 6.7, while V. faba ethyl acetate fraction 32.3, 22.1 over both MCF-7 and HCT-116, respec- tively, Fig. 2. The P. sativum ethyl acetate fraction which possessed the highest activity over breast carcinoma cell line was further
assayed at lower concentrations to calculate its LC50 which was calculated as 73.4 ± 1.7 on Breast carcinoma cell line.

Cytotoxic study of the isolated compounds

The four compounds were tested for their cytotoxic activity over [(MCF-7) and (HCT-116)] as shown in Fig. 3. Apigenin pos- sessed promising cytotoxic effect on breast cancer and colon cell line, so it is further screened over the cell lines to calculate its LC50 value where it recorded the following LC50 values; 44.8, 60.8 over breast and colon tumor cell line, respectively. Apigenin proved to be the most potent tested compound on (MCF-7) and has no cytotoxic effect on normal human skin cell lines, so it is directed to explore its apoptotic mode of action.

Apoptotic mechanism of Apigenin

Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, takes place in all living organisms. Disruption of apoptotic mechanisms could lead to the deregulation of cell proliferation. Targeting the process of apoptosis is an appropriate strategy for prevention and treatment of cancer. Based upon that apigenin effectively suppressed the growth of both

colon and breast tumor cell line with LC50 on breast less than colon, changes in expression of apoptosis- (apoptosis-related genes) of apigenin over (MCF-7) were investigated. Quantitative estimation of BcL2, Bax, Bax/ Bcl2 ratio and caspase 7 were determined. Bcl-2 family members are associated with the intrinsic pathway of pop- tosis comprised of both pro-apoptotic (e.g. Bax, Bid) and anti- apoptotic (e.g. Bcl-2, Bcl-XL) members. Expression of the anti- apoptotic Bcl-2 in breast cancer cell line treated with apigenin was significantly decreased as compared with control ‘‘untreated

The ratio between pro- and anti-apoptotic levels an important determinant of cell survival. The Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in cells treated with apigenin increased drastically, indicating that apoptosis induced in breast cancer cells might be mediated by the mitochon- drial pathway (Fig. 6). Caspase-7 is a member of the caspase family of proteins plays a central role in the apoptotic machinery. Api- genin showed increased in caspase 7 levels in treated breast cancer cell line in comparison to untreated breast cancer cell line as shown in Fig. 7.

Discussion

In our work we attempted to discover the correlation of the lipoidal and phenolic compounds and their impact on some human cell line carcinoma. An extensive number of hydrocarbons and triterpenoids with different groups are known to exhibit chemo- prevention and cytotoxicity against many tumor cells as well as anticancer remedy both in vitro and in vivo [24–26]. Phenolics with its assorted variety of classes are famous of inducing apoptosis and cytotoxic activities on various cancer cell lines. The ability of scav- enging of radicals and antioxidant properties are principally responsible for the antitumor activities of phenolic compounds.

Quantitative structure–activity relationship studies on the cyto- toxic effect of phenolic compounds have been examined in the recent period by many studies [27–29].
Hesperidin which is a major flavonoid in the ethyl acetate frac- tions of both plants under study, has demonstrated to protectively affect CCl4-induced oxidative stress and resultant dysfunction of rat liver which has been correlated to its antioxidant property [30]. Another study investigated hesperidin impact on the prolifer- ation of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells, and prostate cancer cells [31]. On the other hand, pyrogallol, a major phenolic compound identified from V. faba exhibited a moderate effect against prostate cancer cell in a previous study Chew et al. [32] Catechol which is another significant phenolic identified from P. sativum apparently
turned out to have a sensible effect on two breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231[33]. q-Hydroxy benzoic acid, a phenolic acid present in P. sativum and V. faba with great amounts was pre- viously proven to have strong cytotoxic activity on both colon (HCT116) and liver (HEPG2) carcinoma cell line [34]. While pyro- gallol exhibited a potential anticancer activities against renal cell carcinoma cell lines and no activity was observed with normal healthy cells [35].

Conclusion

In the present investigation, it can be clearly noticed that both plant peels are wealthy in phenolics and flavonoids which assumed an important role as antioxidant and anticancer as well. Our out- comes affirmed that apigenin isolated from P. sativum ethyl acetate fraction caused the loss of cell viability of MCF-7 breast cancer cells and induces mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis through Bax acti- vation, Bcl-2 down regulation and imbalance between Bcl-2 and Bax expressions which prompt mitochondria-mediated caspases pathways including activation of caspase-7. These results urge to make the best utilization of plant wastes and reconsider their advantageous use as a promising and effective remedy against many cancer diseases.
