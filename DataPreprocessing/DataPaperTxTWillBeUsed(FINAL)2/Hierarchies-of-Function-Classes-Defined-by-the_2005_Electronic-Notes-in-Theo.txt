Abstract
The first-value operator assigns to any sequence of partial functions of the same type a new such function. Its domain is the union of the domains of the sequence functions, and its value at any point is just the value of the first function in the sequence which is defined at that point.
In this paper, the first-value operator is applied to establish hierarchies of classes of functions under various settings. For effective sequences of computable discrete functions, we obtain a hierarchy connected with Ershov’s one within ∆0. The non-effective version over real functions is connected with the degrees of discontinuity and yields a hierarchy related to Hausdorff’s difference hierarchy in the Borel class ∆B. Finally, the effective version over approximately computable real functions forms a hierarchy which provides a useful tool in computable analysis.
Keywords: Hierarchies of functions, degree of discontinuity, computable analysis, effective descriptive set theory, Hausdorff hierarchy, Ershov hierarchy


Introduction and basic notions
Let F = (fξ)ξ<α be a finite or transfinite sequence of partial functions of some type. This means that fξ : A >−→ B, for sets A and B, α is an ordinal number, and ξ runs through the set {ξ : ξ < α} = {ξ : ξ ∈ α} = α. The

ﬁrst-value operator , Φ , assigns to F the function f : A >−→ B defined by
f (x)   fξx (x) if {ξ < α : fξ(x) ↓} /= ∅ and ξx = min{ξ < α : fξ(x) ↓},
	↑	if fξ(x) ↑ for all ξ < α.
It was introduced by Epstein-Haas-Kramer [3] in order to describe the Ershov hierarchy of classes of discrete sets M ⊆ Nk. In [6,7], we transferred this idea to Hausdorff’s hierarchy establishing a substructure of the Borel class
∆B, as well as to the Hausdorff-Ershov hierarchy within ∆ta, the effective
2	B	2
counterpart of ∆2 . In all these cases, emphasis was put on functions of type
f : A >−→ {0, 1} characterizing sets as Mf = {x : f (x) = 1}.
In the present paper, the interest is directed to classes of functions them- selves. The (minimal) length of sequences, which is needed to obtain a func- tion by means of the first-value operator from some basic class F, determines
the level (or degree) of that function w.r.t. F. This approach both yields a
unifying view to some well-known concepts of classical computability theory and descriptive set theory, as well as it leads to some new features and tools concerning subjects of effective analysis.
We begin with explaining the fundamentals of the non-effective versions of ﬁrst-value hierarchies. Let F be a non-empty basic class of partial functions f : A >−→ B. For any ordinal number α, put
∇α(F) = { Φ(F) : F = (fξ)ξ<α, where fξ ∈ F for all ξ < α } .
So, ∇0(F) = {∅}, where ∅ is the empty function, and ∇1(F) = F. Moreover,



∇α+1
(F) = { f : f (x)   g(x) if g(x) ↓ ,
 h(x) otherwise ,

for g ∈ ∇α(F) and h ∈ F }.
 

dom(fξ), then the function fξ does not influence the result of the sequence, Φ(F). Thus, given a sequence F = (fξ)ξ<α, by transfinite recursion one can de-
fine a sequence F' = (f ')ξ<α' such that α' ≤ α,	dom(f ' ) ⊂	dom(f ' )
and Φ(F) = Φ(F'). So, for countable universes A, we can restrict ourselves to sequences F whose lengths α belong to the second number class, CII , which consists of all ordinal numbers of finite or countably infinite cardinality. Also
if A is a separable topological space and all f ∈ F have open domains, se- quences of lengths α ∈ CII are sufficient to obtain all possible results of the first-value operator applied to arbitrary sequences built of functions from F.
The main subject of this paper is to explore properties of linear hierarchies

( ∇·· ·(F) )α∈C
, under several settings concerning the universes A and the

basic class F, possibly combined with requirements concerning the sequences
F to which the operator Φ has to be applied. They will be indicated by upper


labels at the ∇-sign.
For a first illustration, let A = B = N and consider the basic classes
Fsing = { f : f : N >−→ N , card(f ) ≤ 1 }	and
Ffin = { f : f : N >−→ N , card(f ) < ω }.
Obviously, ∇n(Fsing) = {f : card(f ) ≤ n } and ∇n(Ffin) = Ffin if 1 ≤ n < ω, but ∇α(Fsing) = ∇α(Ffin) = {f : f : N >−→ N } for all α ≥ ω.
Quite analogous results hold for functions of type f : Nk >−→ N, k ≥ 1, as well as for many other similar settings. So, the non-effective versions of first-value hierarchies over discrete universes collapse already at level ω with the largest possible class of partial functions, even for simple basic classes F. To obtain more interesting results over discrete universes, the operator Φ will be restricted to effective sequences. This is just the subject of the next section. Then we shall consider real-valued functions over Euclidean spaces, f : Rk >−→ R. The non-effective setting studied in Section 3 provides the
basic background of the effective version which is elaborated in Section 4.

The Ershov hierarchy for discrete functions
Now we are going to study the first-value operator on effective sequences of computable functions of type f : Nk >−→ N. The related notions and results are essentially known from the recursion theoretic setting around Ershov’s hierarchy, cf. [3].
Effectivity for transfinite sequences is defined by means of constructive ordinals. We report some fundamental facts and denotations employed in the sequel. For more details, the reader may consult [16]. Let (φn : n ∈ N) be the Kleene numbering of the partial recursive functions.
A naming system (of ordinals), S, is given by a numbering νS : N >−→ CII such that
ran(νS) is an initial segment of ordinals, ran(νS) = α = {ξ : ξ < α} for some α ∈ CII;
for any n ∈ dom(νS), it is decidable (by a partial recursive function kS) whether νS(n) = 0 or whether νS(n) is a successor or a limit number;
for any number n, where νS(n) is a successor, a number n' is computable (by a partial recursive function pS) such that n ∈ ν−1(νS(n')+ 1);
and for any name n ∈ ν−1(λ) of a limit number λ, an index n' is computable (by a partial recursive function qS) such that φn' is a total function and (νS(φn' (m))m∈N is an increasing sequence of ordinals converging to λ. More precisely, S = (νS, kS, pS, qS). An ordinal α ∈ CII is called con-


structive iff there is a naming system S for which α ∈ ran(νS). S is called recursively related iff the set {(n, n') : n, n' ∈ dom(νS), νS(n) ≤ νS(n')} is recursive, it is called univalent iff νS is injective. To any constructive ordinal α, there is a recursively related, univalent (briefly, r.r.u.) system S assigning
a name to that ordinal. So we can restrict ourselves to such special naming systems which are denoted in the form α/S. For α ≤ ω the canonical naming system with the identical mapping as numbering is always used, w.l.o.g.
For a naming system S, S-computability of a function f : Nk × CII >−→ N,
k ∈ N, means that there is a recursive function ϕ : Nk × N >−→ N such that
ϕ(→x, n)  f (→x, νS(n)) for all →x ∈ Nk and n ∈ dom(νS). For a naming system
α/S, an α-sequence F = (fξ)ξ<α of functions fξ : Nk >−→ N is said to be S-computable iff there is an S-computable function f : Nk × CII >−→ N such that f (→x, ξ)  fξ(→x) for all →x ∈ Nk and all ordinals ξ < α. Then, if S is
recursively related, the domain of the function Φ(F ) is r.e.: dom( Φ(F)) =


  ξ<α
dom(fξ) ∈ Σ0.

A function f : Nk >−→ N is called α/S-recursive iff f = Φ(F) for an S- computable α-sequence F of k-ary partial recursive functions; f is said to be α-recursive iff it is α/S-recursive for some r.r.u. naming system α/S. So we get the following Ershov classes of functions, in the notation-dependent and the notation-independent version, i.e., with and without “/S”, respectively:

E
α(/S)
= {f : f is an α(/S)-recursive function from some Nk into N }.

Obviously, ∇E
E
(α+1)(/S)
if S is a naming system for α + 1 too. Let

<α(/S) =  β<α
E
β(/S).

Proposition 2.1 For all r.r.u. naming systems (α + 1)/S and λ/S, with limit numbers λ,

E
α/S
E
(α+1)/S
E
<λ/S
λ/S .

This follows immediately from analog results for the classes ∆E
of the

original Ershov hierarchy, cf. [4,3,7]. These classes consist of the so-called α/S-recursive subsets of Nk, which are characterized by the α/S-recursivity of their total characteristic functions in the above defined sense. Thus, due
to the classical results, there are even total {0, 1}-valued discrete functions in

E
(α+1)/S
E
α/S
and ∇E
E
<λ/S
, respectively.	 

The following proposition characterizes the functions occurring in the Er-
shov hierarchy. It also shows that the notation-independent hierarchy collapses
at level ω2. Recall that f ≤T 0' means that the function f is 0'-computable. A function f : Nk >−→ N is called limit-computable iff there is a total recursive function ϕ : Nk+1 −→ N such that f (→x)  limn→∞ ϕ(→x, n).


Proposition 2.2 For any function f : Nk >−→ N are equivalent:

f ∈ ∇E
, for a constructive ordinal α and a r.r.u. system α/S;

f ≤T 0' and dom(f ) is r.e.;
f is limit-computable and dom(f ) is r.e.;
f ∈ ∇E .
The equivalence (ii) ⇔ (iii) is well-known. (iv) ⇒ (i) is trivial, and (i) ⇒
(iii) is easily shown. Finally, (iii) ⇒ (iv) was proved in [3].	 

The Hausdorff hierarchy for real functions
Hausdorff’s difference hierarchy within the Borel class ∆B over (complete and separable) topological spaces was essentially established in [5]. This topo- logical setting was mainly directed to classes of pointsets and is not directly transferable to function classes. Moreover, in topology it is less customary to deal with partial functions, a basic feature in applying the operator Φ. A considerable progress to a related classification of functions was made by Hertling-Weihrauch and Hertling who introduced and studied the levels of discontinuity of functions, see [10,8,9]. Finally, in [7] we have shown how the Hausdorff hierarchy of classes of pointsets can be characterized by means of the first-value operator. This setting is now transferred to a classification of certain real-valued functions over Euclidean spaces.
By a real function, we mean any partial function f : Rk >−→ R, for an arbitrary dimension k ∈ N+ . It is said to be continuous iff for all open G ⊆ R the preimages f −1[G] are open pointsets too. In particular, dom(f ) = f −1[R] has to be open. The basic class of the hierarchy we are going to introduce will
be that of continuous functions,
Fcont = {f : f is a continuous real function }.
For an ordinal α ∈ CII, a real function f is said to be α-continuous iff there is an α-sequence F = (fξ)ξ<α of continuous functions fξ ∈ Fcont such that f = Φ(F).  Notice that then dom(f ) =  ξ<α dom(fξ) is open too.  The 1-continuous functions are just the members of Fcont.
The classes of the Hausdorff hierarchy for real functions are defined as
∇H = {f : f is an α-continuous real function} and ∇H =	∇H.
Proposition 3.1 For all ordinals α and limit numbers λ with α, λ ∈ CII,
∇H ⊂ ∇H	and	∇H ⊂ ∇H .
α	(α+1)	<λ	λ
This follows from related properties of the usual Hausdorff hierarchy for


the classes ∆H, cf. [7]. They consist of the α-clopen pointsets A, which are just those whose total characteristic functions χA are α-continuous. Thus,
there are total {0, 1}-valued real functions in ∇H	\ ∇H and ∇H \ ∇H ,
(α+1)	α	λ	<λ
respectively.	 
Another characterization of Hausdorff’s hierarchy of functions can be ob- tained by the technique of depth analysis. It goes also back to Hausdorff [5], who showed that the resolvable sets are exactly the members of ∆B. In
[6,7], we have combined his method with features of Ershov’s hierarchy [4] within ∆0. Before that, Hertling-Weihrauch [10] and Hertling [8,9] had ap- plied Hausdorff’s method to functions over topological spaces and introduced related levels of discontinuity. Here we essentially follow their setting, even if the notations are modified in order to remain in accordance with [7] and to prepare for a smooth passage to the effective version in the following section.
For a closed set F ⊆ Rk and an arbitrary A ⊆ F , let A|◦ denote the interior

of A relatively to F . Thus, A|◦ =
F
{B ∩ F : B ∩ F ⊆ A, B is open in Rk }.

Given a real function f : Rk >−→ R, let the pointsets Cξ , Uξ ⊆ Rk, for
f	f
all ordinals ξ, be defined by transfinite recursion as follows:
C0 = {→x : f (→x) ↓, and f is continuous in →x }|◦ ,
f	Rk
this is the interior of the domain of continuity of f . For ξ > 0, put

Uξ =   Cη and Cξ = {→x ∈ Uξ : f (→x) ↓ , f | ξ is continuous in →x }|	.
f	f	f	f	U		ξ f
η<ξ
Herein and throughout the paper, the overline denotes the complement of a set. Since U 0 =	∅ = Rk, the initial step is included in the general recursion

f
step. By transfinite induction, it follows that any union
Cη is open in

Rk and all universes Uξ are closed pointsets. Moreover, Cη ∩ Cξ = ∅ if η /= ξ,
f	f	f
and
Rk = U 0 ⊇ U 1 ⊇ ... ⊇ Uξ ⊇ Uξ+1 ⊇ ... ⊇ dom(f ) .
f	f	f	f
Thus, there is a least ordinal α ∈ CII such that Uα = Uα+1 or, equivalently,
f	f
Cα = ∅. Then we have Uη ⊃ Uξ and Cη /= ∅ for all η < ξ ≤ α, but Uα = Uξ
f	f	f	f	f	f
and Cξ = ∅ for all ξ ≥ α.
The function f is called resolvable iff Uα = dom(f ) for this least ordinal α, at which the sequence of universes becomes stationary. In this case, we have

dom(f ) = 


ξ<α
Cξ,

and we define the local depth of a point →x ∈ dom(f ) w.r.t. function f by
ξ
depthf (→x) = ξ iff →x ∈ C ,


whereas the global depth of f is given by

udepth(f ) = min{ξ : Uξ = dom(f ) }.
There are close relationships between resolvability and α-continuity.
Lemma 3.2 Let f = Φ(F) with F = (fξ)ξ<α, fξ ∈ Fcont, α ∈ CII. Then, for all ordinals ξ < α,


η≤ξ
dom(fη) ⊆ 


η≤ξ
Cη .

This holds for ξ = 0, i.e., dom(f0) ⊆ C0, since C0 is the largest open set on
f	f
which f is continuous, f0 coincides with f on dom(f0) and f0 is continuous.
Now let the assertion be fulfilled for all ξ' < ξ. Then,

Uξ = 


Cη = 
Cη ⊆ 
dom(fη) = 


dom(fη) .

ξ is the largest relatively open subset of Uξ on which f | ξ is continuous.
f
Moreover, fξ(→x) = f (→x) for all →x ∈ dom(fξ) \ (  η<ξ dom(fη)) = dom(fξ) ∩
dom(fη) ⊇ dom(fξ) ∩ Uξ, and fξ is continuous. Thus, dom(fξ) ∩ Uξ ⊆

η<ξ
Cξ, and

dom(fη) = dom(fξ) ∪ 
dom(fη) ⊆ dom(fξ) ∪ 
f
Cη ⊆

(dom(fξ) ∩ Uξ) ∪	Cη ⊆	Cη.	 
From Lemma 3.2 one obtains the resolvability of any real function, which is α-continuous for some α ∈ CII. Indeed, if f = Φ(F) with a sequence F =

(fξ)ξ<α, fξ ∈ Fcont, then  η<α
dom(fη) = dom(f ). Since 

η<ξ
Cη ⊆ dom(f )

for all ordinals ξ, it follows Cα = ∅. Thus, f is resolvable.
Moreover, by Lemma 3.2, udepth(f ) is a lower bound of the lengths of sequences of continuous functions, F, with Φ(F) = f .
Lemma 3.3 If a real function f is resolvable, then there is a sequence F =
(fξ)ξ<udepth(f ) such that f = Φ(F) and, moreover,

(+)	fξ ∈ Fcont and 

η≤ξ
dom(fη) = 

η≤ξ
η for all ξ < udepth(f ) .

Put f0 = f |C0 , and the requirement (+) is fulfilled for ξ = 0.
Suppose fη has been defined for all η < ξ such that (+) holds.  Then
we have	dom(fη) =	Cη. By definition of Cξ, there is an open set
G ⊆ Rk such that Cξ = Uξ ∩ G, i.e., G ⊆	Cη ⊆ dom(f ). Moreover, f | ξ
is a continuous function on Cξ, considered as a closed subset of the normal space G. Thus, by the Tietze-Urysohn theorem, see [2], f | ξ can be extended
f
to a continuous function fξ over G. So we have dom(fξ) = G and fξ(→x) = f (→x)
for all →x ∈ Cξ. It follows	dom(fη) =	Cη, and (+) is fulfilled.	 
Proposition 3.4 A real function is resolvable iff it is α-continuous for some

α ∈ CII. More precisely, for any α ∈ CII,
∇H = {f : f is a resolvable real function, and udepth(f ) ≤ α } .
This only summarizes some results obtained so far.	 
A sequence of real functions, F = (fξ)ξ<α, is called greedy iff, for f = Φ(F) and any →x ∈ dom(f ), →x ∈ dom(fξ) whenever depthf (→x) = ξ.
Notice that the length α of a greedy sequence for function f can obviously be restricted to udepth(f ). Now Lemma 3.3 can be expressed as follows.
Corollary 3.5 Any resolvable real function can be obtained as Φ(F), with a greedy sequence F of continuous functions.	 
The following result, shown by Hertling [8] for total functions over metric spaces, stresses that the resolvable functions belong to a rather low level of complexity within the framework of descriptive set theory. Here the notion of Γ-measurable function is employed, cf. [11,15]: Given a class of pointsets, Γ,
a real function is called Γ-measurable iff f −1[G] ∈ Γ for all open G ⊆ R.
Lemma 3.6 Any resolvable real function is ∆B-measurable.
This can be proved by means of set resolvability, cf. [8]. Here we sketch a direct proof by means of Proposition 3.2, which can be effectivized in a rather straightforward way, cf. Section 4.
Let f = Φ(F) with a sequence F = (fξ)ξ<α, fξ ∈ Fcont, and let G ⊆ R

be an open set. Then f −1[G] =  ξ<α
( f −1[G] ∩ 

η<ξ
dom(fη) ). The open

pointsets f −1[G] are unions of countably many closed sets: f −1[G] = 
Fξ,i ,

ξ
'
ξ	η<ξ
ξ


dom(fη) are closed too. Hence
i<ω

f −1[G] = 
ξ<α
( (  i<ω
Fξ,i ) ∩ F ' ) = 


ξ<α


i<ω
( Fξ,i ∩ F ' ) .

This means that f −1[G] ∈ ΣB, as a countable union of closed sets. A related representation of the complement is obtained analogously.	 
For any set A ∈ ∆B, A ⊆ Rk, the real function fA = A × {1} is ∆B-
2	B	2
measurable. However, it cannot be resolvable if dom(fA) = A /∈ Σ1 . It is an
open question whether the conversion of Lemma 3.6 holds for functions with open domains or, equivalently, as one can show, for total functions.

The Hausdorff-Ershov hierarchy for real functions
The Hausdorff-Ershov hierarchy for functions is obtained by a suitable com- bination of ingredients both of Ershov’s hierarchy for discrete functions and of the Hausdorff hierarchy for real functions. One feature of effectivity, that


we take over from Ershov’s setting, consists in the restriction to construc- tive ordinals as order types of sequences of real functions. Moreover, these functions have to be computable, and this is defined within the framework of computable analysis, cf. [17]. We briefly recall some related basic ideas and notations. For more details, see [6,7].
Real numbers (and tuples) are represented by fast converging Cauchy se- quences of (tuples of) rational numbers. Let be fixed a total standard num- bering νQ = (qn : n ∈ N) of the set of rational numbers Q = {qn : n ∈ N}. It is extended to Qk via Cantor’s k-tuple function such that Qk = {→qn :
n ∈ N}. For points →x = (x1,... , xk) ∈ Rk, we prefer the maximum norm
→x  = maxk	|xκ| which is topologically equivalent to the Euclidean norm.
The natural topology in Rk is generated by the base of all rational open balls,
Ballq(→x) = {→y ∈ Rk : →x − →y  < q}, q ∈ Q, →x ∈ Qk. Let a numbering of them, (balln : n ∈ N), be fixed by ball⟨n,m⟩ = Ballqn (→qm), for any dimension k determined by the context, where ⟨· , ·⟩ denotes Cantor’s pairing function.
Computability of partial real functions f : Rk >−→ R is defined by means of function-oracle Turing machines, due to Ko-Friedman [13] and Kreitz-
Weihrauch [14]. The points →x ∈ Rk are represented by (sequences of in- dices of) effectively converging Cauchy sequences, i.e., by sequences of the set CF→x = {σ ∈ Nω :  →qσ(n) − →x  < 2−n for all n ∈ N }. A function-oracle Tur- ing machine (OTM) M gets a natural number n as input and a sequence σ = (i0, i1, i2, ... ) ∈ Nω as oracle, and it has produced an output Mσ(n) ∈ N when it halts. In the course of its work, it can put oracle queries “ m ? ”, for
m ∈ N, which are answered by the (m + 1)st element im of the sequence σ. A real function is called (approximately) computable iff there is an OTM
M such that for all →x ∈ Rk:
if f (→x) ↓, then Mσ(n) exists for all σ ∈ CF→x and n ∈ N, and it holds (Mσ(n))n∈N ∈ CFf(→x);
if f (→x) ↑ and σ ∈ CF→x, there is an input n ∈ N for which Mσ(n) ↑.
Ko-Friedman used a more restrictive notion. Instead of (ii), they required (ii’) if f (→x) ↑, then Mσ(n) is undefined for all σ ∈ CF→x and all n ∈ N.
We call a function f KF-computable iff (i) and (ii’) for an OTM M.
Πta is the class of complements of members of Σta, m ∈ N+ , and a pointset
m	m
A belongs to Σta iff, for a total recursive function ϕ : Nm −→ N, (∗)	A =   n1∈N  n2∈N ···  nm∈N ballϕ(n1 ,n2,···,nm)	if m is odd,
  n1∈N  n2∈N ···  nm∈N ballϕ(n1 ,n2,···,nm)	if m is even.


If ϕ is allowed to be an arbitrary discrete function, (∗) is the typical rep- resentation of a Borel set A ∈ ΣB. Whereas the domains of approximately
m	ta
computable functions form exactly the class Π2 in the effective Borel hierar-
chy (Σta : m ∈ N+ ), the domains of KF-computable functions are just the
m	ta
r.e. open sets, i.e., the members of Σ1 . More precisely, we have
Lemma 4.1 A pointset A is r.e. open iff A = dom(f ) for a KF-computable real function f. An approximately computable real function f is KF-computable iff dom(f ) is r.e. open.
The first part is due to Ko-Friedman [13], the second one follows easily. Due to Lemma 4.1 and since computable functions are continuous on their domains, the KF-computable real functions form an appropriate effective
counterpart of the class of continuous functions, Fcont. Thus, we take
FKF = {f : f is a KF-computable real function }
as the basic class of the effective first-value hierarchy. Effectivity of a trans- finite sequence of functions from FKF is defined w.r.t. some r.r.u. naming
system α/S. A sequence F = (fξ)ξ<α is said to be S-KF-computable iff there
is an OTM M such that, for all points →x and ordinals ξ < α,
if fξ(→x) ↓, then Mσ(⟨m, n⟩) ↓ for all σ ∈ CF→x and all n ∈ N, where
m = ν−1(ξ), and it holds (Mσ(⟨m, n⟩))n∈N ∈ CFf (→x);
S	ξ
if fξ(→x) ↑, then Mσ(⟨m, n⟩) ↑ for all σ ∈ CF→x, all n ∈ N and m = ν−1(ξ).
Obviously, it follows fξ ∈ FKF for all ξ < α.
A real function f is called α/S-toprecursive iff f = Φ(F) for an S-KF-
computable sequence F = (fξ)ξ<α. α-toprecursivity means α/S-toprecursivity
w.r.t. some r.r.u. naming system α/S. The 1-toprecursive functions are just the KF-computable ones. Each α-toprecursive function is α-continuous and has an r.e. open domain.
For constructive ordinals α (and r.r.u. α/S), the notation-dependent and notation-independent, respectively, versions of the Hausdorff-Ershov classes of functions are defined as

HE
α(/S)
= {f : f is an α(/S)-toprecursive real function}.

By reasons of cardinality, we have ∇HE
  {∇HE : α is a constructive ordinal }⊂ 
⊂ ∇H, for α /= 0, and even
∇H. Properties of the related

α
hierarchy of classes of pointsets yield
α∈CII	α

Proposition 4.2 For all constructive ordinals α, constructive limits λ (and corresponding r.r.u. naming systems (α + 1)/S and λ/S, respectively),

HE

HE
(α+1)(/S)

Indeed, a pointset A ⊆ Rk belongs to ∆HE
in the sense of [7] iff its total

characteristic function χA belongs to ∇HE
. Therefore, using results from [7],

we get the strict inclusions.	 
To localize the functions occurring in classes of the Hausdorff-Ershov hier- archy, Lemma 3.6 can straightforwardly be effectivized within the framework of computable analysis. We sketch this briefly. For details of the definitions and proof techniques, the reader is referred to [1].
Let N m be the set of all discrete total functions ϕ : Nm −→ N, m ∈ N+ . They can be represented by sequences σϕ ∈ Nω in a canonical, bijective way. For example, put σϕ(n) = ϕ(γm(n)), where γm is an effective standard bijection of N onto Nm. Thus, the sets A ∈ ΣB can also be represented by the sequences σ ∈ Nω, namely if σ = σϕ for some ϕ ∈ N m satisfying the typical
equation (∗) given above. Now, a real function f is called effectively ΣB - measurable iff there is an (approximately) computable function g : Nω −→ Nω such that, whenever a sequence σ represents an open set A ∈ ΣB, A ⊆ R, the sequence g(σ) represents the preimage f −1[A] as a member of ΣB.
Analogously, we call a real function f effectively ∆B -measurable iff there
are (approximately) computable functions g, g : Nω −→ Nω such that, when- ever a sequence σ represents an open set A ⊆ R, the sequence g(σ) represents the preimage f −1[A] and g(σ) represents the complement, f −1[A], both as
members of ΣB. By the effective analogue of the proof of Lemma 3.6, with

Lemma 4.3 If a real function is α/S-toprecursive w.r.t. some r.r.u. naming system α/S, then it is effectively ∆B-measurable.	 
For classes of pointsets, relationships between the Hausdorff-Ershov hier- archy and the Ershov hierarchy have been obtained by considering the discrete parts A∩Nk of pointsets A ⊆ Rk. For functions, the situation is not so simple, since the restrictions of real functions f : Rk >−→ R to Nk are not necessarily discrete. Conversely, non-empty discrete functions, f : Nk >−→ N, if they are considered as real ones, are not continuous in the sense of Section 3, since the domains are not open. Nevertheless, the Ershov hierarchy of discrete functions can be embedded into the Hausdorff-Ershov hierarchy by means of the oper- ator Q assigning to a discrete function f : Nk >−→ N the continuous function
Q(f ) : Rk >−→ R defined as Q(f ) =  { Ball 1 (→x) × {f (→x)} : →x ∈ dom(f ) }.

Proposition 4.4 For any f : Nk >−→ N and every r.r.u. system α/S,

iff Q(f ) ∈ ∇HE .

Indeed, for an S-computable sequence F = (fξ)ξ<α of discrete functions
fξ, the sequence of real functions Q(F) = (Q(fξ) )ξ<α is S-computable too, in


the related sense. Moreover, Φ(Q(F)) = Q(Φ(F) ). Conversely, if Q(f ) = Φ(F) for an S-computable sequence F = (fξ)ξ<α of k-ary real functions, then the
sequence F' = (f ')ξ<α, where f ' = fξ| k , consists of discrete functions and is
ξ	ξ	N
S-computable in the sense of Section 2. Moreover, Φ(F') = f .	 
So, the Hausdorff-Ershov hierarchy of function classes is at least as rich as the related Ershov hierarchy.  Propositions 2.1 and 4.4 show that each
class ∇HE contains continuous functions which do not belong to any lower class ∇HE for α' < α. In other words, there are real functions f ∈ ∇H =
Fcont, which have the level α/S in the notation-dependent Hausdorff-Ershov
hierarchy, i.e., f ∈ ∇HE \ ∇HE  .  So the level of toprecursivity of a real
α/S	<α/S
function can be arbitrarily higher than its level of continuity.
Those functions which admit computable greedy sequences, representing them by means of the first-value operator, are of special interest. For such a function, its level in the Hausdorff hierarchy coincides with that in the Hausdorff-Ershov hierarchy. Moreover, for each point →x from the domain, the computation of the function value in →x can be performed by computing fξ(→x), just at the first stage ξ which is possible at all, by topological reasons.
So, a real function f is called weakly (α/S-)computable iff there is an S- KF-computable greedy sequence F = (fξ)ξ<α with f = Φ(F).
A sharper condition requires that, moreover, if fξ(→x) ↓, then there is a point →y close to →x such that depthf (→y) = ξ, thus, f (→y) = fξ(→y) ↓.
More precisely, a real function f is called safely (α/S-)computable iff there
is an S-KF-computable double sequence D = (fn,ξ)n<ω, ξ<α such that the sequences F n = ((fn,ξ)ξ<α are greedy and Φ(F n) = f , for all n ∈ N, and whenever fn,ξ(→x) ↓, then there is a point →y ∈ Ball2−n (→x) with depthf (→y) = ξ. S-KF-computability of D means that there is an OTM M such that, for all points →x, numbers n ∈ N and ordinals ξ < α,
if fξ(→x) ↓, then Mσ(⟨n, m, l⟩) ↓ for all σ ∈ CF→x, n, l ∈ N and m = ν−1(ξ),
and it holds (Mσ(⟨n, m, l⟩))l∈N ∈ CFf (→x);
if fξ(→x) ↑, then Mσ(⟨n, m, l⟩) ↑ for all σ ∈ CF→x, all n, l ∈ N and m =
ν−1(ξ).
By examples constructed in [7], we have
Lemma 4.5 To any r.r.u. system α/S, there is a safely α/S-computable function fα/S : R −→ {0, 1} with udepth(fα/S) = α.	 
So, fα/S witnesses that there are safely α/S-computable, hence also weakly α/S-computable, functions that are of level α in the (non-effective) Hausdorff hierarchy. From the discussion in [7], it also follows that there are weakly computable (total) functions which are not safely computable.


By means of the notion of r.e. closed set, the safely computable func- tions can be characterized among the weakly computable ones. Recall that a pointset A ⊆ Rk is said to be r.e. closed iff A = ∅ or there is a total recursive function ϕ : N2 −→ N such that there is a sequence (→xn)n∈N of points →xn ∈ Rk
satisfying  →qϕ(n,m) − →xn  < 2−m for all n, m ∈ N, and A = cl({→xn : n ∈ N}), where cl denotes the closure of a set.
If a real function f is safely α/S-computable, then the closures of the domains of continuity, i.e., the sets cl(Cξ), ξ < α, are uniformly r.e. closed . This means that there is a recursive function ϕ : N3 >−→ N such that the functions ϕξ : N2 >−→ N, defined by ϕξ(n, m)  ϕ(ν−1(ξ), n, m), are total and witness that the sets cl(Cξ) are r.e. closed sets in the above sense.
Conversely, given a weakly α/S-computable function f such that the sets cl(Cξ), ξ < α, are uniformly r.e. closed, the safe α/S-computability can easily be shown. So we have
Lemma 4.6 A weakly α/S-computable function f is safely α/S-computable iff the sets cl(Cξ), ξ < α, are uniformly r.e. closed.	 

Here we conclude. The notions and results presented in this paper provide a unified framework for non-effective and effective hierarchies of classes of
real functions which all are ∆B-measurable and effectively ∆B-measurable,

respectively.  This establishes a useful tool in classifying certain functions
both from the viewpoint of descriptive set theory as well as of computable analysis. Nevertheless, it should be remarked that we know only some basic facts and relationships so far, many questions are still open.
