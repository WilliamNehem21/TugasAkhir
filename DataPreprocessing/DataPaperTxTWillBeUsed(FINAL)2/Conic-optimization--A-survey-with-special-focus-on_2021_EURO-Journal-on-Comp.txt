A conic optimization problem is a problem involving a constraint that the optimization variable be in some closed convex cone. Prominent examples are linear programs (LP), second order cone programs (SOCP), semidefinite problems (SDP), and copositive problems. We survey recent progress made in this area. In particular, we highlight the connections between nonconvex quadratic problems, binary quadratic problems, and copositive optimization. We review how tight bounds can be obtained by relaxing the copositivity constraint to semidefiniteness, and we discuss the effect that different modelling techniques have on the quality of the bounds. We also provide some new techniques for lifting linear constraints and show how these can be used for stable set and coloring relaxations.

A conic optimization problem is a problem involving a constraint that the optimization variable be in some closed convex cone. The field of conic optimization is a broad one, as any convex optimization prob- lem can be cast as a conic problem, see Nesterov and Nemirovski (1992). In this paper, we will focus on more specific conic problems which ap- pear naturally when solving quadratic or combinatorial optimization problems. In particular, we will highlight developments in second or- der cone programming (SOCP), semidefinite programming (SDP), and copositive optimization.

The general linear conic problem and its dual

Consider a proper cone G, i.e., a closed convex and full dimensional cone which is also pointed, meaning that G does not contain a straight
line, or equivalently, that G ∩ (−G) = {0}. For example, when consider-
nius inner product 𝐴, 𝐵	trace 𝐴 𝐵 , in case of vectors, it denotes
the Euclidean inner product. Problem (P) therefore aims to minimize
a linear function over the intersection of a proper cone and an aﬃne subspace.
As in linear programming, a primal problem of the form (P) always comes with a dual problem which involves the dual cone: given an ar-
bitrary cone	⊆ ℝ𝑚×𝑛, the dual cone  ∗ is defined as
G∗ ∶= {𝑋 ∈ ℝ𝑚×𝑛 ∣ 𝑋, 𝐾 ≥ 0 for all 𝐾 ∈ G}.
As usual, the Lagrangian function 𝐿 ∶ G × ℝ𝑚 → ℝ is defined as

𝐿(𝑋, 𝑦) ∶= 𝐶, 𝑋 +	𝑦 (𝑏 − 𝐴 , 𝑋 ).

In order to get strong duality, we need constraint qualifications:

over the so called 𝑝-order cone G𝑝 ∶= {(𝑥 , 𝑥) ∈ ℝ × ℝ	∣ 𝑥 ≥ ‖𝑥‖ }


that the problem fulfills the primal (resp. dual) Slater condition.

Note that strict feasibility can always be enforced by consider- ing the so called skew-symmetric embedding of the original problem, see de Klerk et al. (1997). Assuming strict feasibility gives us strong duality:


strictly feasible solution (𝑦, 𝑍). Then the primal and dual optimal values are Theorem 1.2 (Strong Duality Theorem). Assume that problem (D) has a equal: 𝑝∗ = 𝑑∗, and if 𝑝∗ < +∞, then 𝑝∗ is attained, i.e., there exists a primal feasible solution 𝑋∗ with 𝑝∗ = 𝐶, 𝑋 .
Conversely, assume that problem (P) has a strictly feasible solution 𝑋. Then the primal and dual optimal values are equal: 𝑝∗ = 𝑑∗, and if 𝑑∗ > −∞,
with 𝑝 ≥ 1, see e.g. Vinel and Krokhmal (2014). Any 𝑝-order cone with
𝑝 rational can be modeled as SOCP. We refer to Mosek (2021-10-11) for
details.
A third prominent setting is semidefinite programming (SDP), where is considered to be the cone of symmetric positive semidefinite matri-
ces  + ∶= {𝑋 ∈ ℝ𝑛×𝑛 ∣ 𝑋 = 𝑋𝑇 , 𝑋 ⪰ 0}. SDPs are used to model prob-
lems with linear matrix inequalities. They appear in eigenvalue op-
timization and control theory, see Vandenberghe and Boyd (1996), Helmberg (2002). Arguably two of the most important areas of applica- tion for SDP are robust and combinatorial optimization. For an in depth discussion of SDP in robust optimization, we refer to the book (Ben- Tal et al., 2009) and the recent survey paper (Yanıkoğlu et al., 2019). The role of SDP in relaxations of combinatorial problems will be covered in more detail below.

A proof of this theorem along with a thorough discussion of conic du- ality can be found for example in Ben-Tal and Nemirovski (2001). It has been shown in Dür et al. (2017) that the Slater condition (and hence strong duality) is a generic property of conic problems which loosely speaking means that Slater’s condition is fulfilled (and hence strong du-
ized in the space of data (𝐶, 𝐴1 , ..., 𝐴𝑚, 𝑏1 , ..., 𝑏𝑚 ). We stress that a con- ality holds) for almost all feasible conic problems which are parameter-
linear programming, where = ℝ𝑛 . The reason why a positive duality straint qualification is unnecessary if the cone  is polyhedral like in
gap may occur in general conic programming lies in the geometry of the problem and happens if the feasible set is contained in a nontrivial face of the cone.
Note that existence of strictly feasible points is important not only for theoretical purposes to ensure strong duality, but also many optimiza- tion algorithms require this property. In the absence of strictly feasible points, a solver may not terminate or may produce a “solution” with no useful meaning. This is a feature that distinguishes general conic op- timization from linear programming. Consequently, very careful mod- elling is needed, since often existence of strictly feasible points can be guaranteed if the problem is modelled in a proper way. We will return to this point in Section 5.
Two approaches have been developed to tackle conic problems that fail to fulfill a constraint qualification: (i) Facial reduction attempts to
identify the so called minimal cone min for problem (P), such that prob-
instances of so called symmetric cones that can be studied in the unifying framework of Euclidean Jordan algebras, see Faybusovich (2008) and references therein.
These three problem classes have been studied for decades because of their countless applications and because they can be solved eﬃciently: it has been shown in the vast literature on interior point methods pi- oneered by Nesterov and Nemirovskii (1994) (see also Renegar, 2001) that these algorithms are able to solve LPs, SOCPs, and SDPs in polyno- mial time. A different class of algorithms that solves SDPs is conic bundle methods, see Helmberg and Rendl (2000), Helmberg et al. (2014). Nu- merous software implementations are available, and we refer the reader to Hans Mittelmann’s website (Mittelmann, 2021) for an up-to-date list of the various packages.

1.3. Variants of SDP and SOCP

So far, we discussed linear conic optimization problems. However, the enormous modelling power of semidefinite and second order cone programming only unfolds if we allow for nonlinearities or integer vari- ables:
Mixed integer conic optimization problems are linear conic problems with a constraint that some of the variables are integer valued:
min   𝐶, 𝑋
s.t.	⟨𝐴𝑖 , 𝑋⟩ = 𝑏𝑖  (𝑖 = 1, … , 𝑚)

lem (P) with G replaced by Tmin is strictly feasible and has the same opti-
mal solution as (P). This facial reduction technique goes back to Borwein
and Wolkowicz (1981a,b). (ii) Other approaches (e.g. Ramana, 1997) work on the dual side and construct an extended dual which achieves strong duality without assuming a constraint qualification. A good ex- position of these two approaches can be found in Pataki (2013).

Sometimes binary constraints 𝑋𝑖𝑗 ∈ {0, 1} for (𝑖, 𝑗) ∈ 𝐽 are used instead.
constraint, mostly a semidefiniteness constraint ( = +) or an SOCP Nonlinear conic problems are nonlinear problems that involve a cone constraint ( = 𝑛). Naturally, mixed integer nonlinear conic problems
have been studied likewise.



It would be beyond the scope of this paper to discuss the develop- ment in mixed integer nonlinear conic optimization here. We mention just a few applications:
Nonlinear SOCPs appear for example in facility location (Chen et al., 2011). Mixed integer SOCPs appear in engineering (e.g. turbine bal- ancing problems), in service system design (Góez and Anjos, 2019), in finance (e.g. cardinality-constrained portfolio optimization), or in combinatorial problems like the Euclidean Steiner Tree Problem, see (Gally et al., 2018) and references therein. Solution approaches for these problems include semismooth Newton methods (Chen et al., 2011), outer approximation algorithms (Drewes and Ulbrich, 2012), cutting plane algorithms (Atamtürk and Narayanan, 2007; Drewes and Pokutta, 2014; Kobayashi and Takano, 2020), and Branch-and-Bound algorithms (Gally et al., 2018).
Mixed integer SDPs have applications in truss topology optimiza- tion (Gally et al., 2018), in certain clustering problems (Aloise and Hansen, 2009), or in sparse principal component analysis (Li and Xie, 2020). References to numerous fields of application of nonlinear SDPs in engineering, (robust) control, finance and others can be found in Andreani et al. (2020) and Yamashita and Yabe (2015).
Solution algorithms for these problems include augmented La- grangian methods, sequential SDP methods, and primal-dual inte- rior point methods, see e.g., Andreani et al. (2020), Kocvara and Stingl (2012), Yamashita and Yabe (2015). For pointers to soft- ware implementations, we refer again to Hans Mittelmann’s web- site (Mittelmann, 2021).

Conic reformulations of quadratic problems
optimization problems. Bomze et al. (2000) introduced the term “copos- itive optimization” and showed for the first time equivalence of a non- convex quadratic optimization problem and a linear problem over resp.	: They considered standard quadratic optimization problems,
i.e., nonconvex quadratic problems over the standard simplex Δ ∶= {𝑥 ∈
ℝ𝑛 ∣ 𝑒𝑇 𝑥 = 1} where 𝑒 ∈ ℝ𝑛 denotes the all-ones vector. Given a symmet- ric matrix 𝑄 ∈ ℝ𝑛×𝑛, a standard quadratic problem is of the form
min 𝑥𝑇 𝑄𝑥
s.t. 𝑒𝑇 𝑥 = 1	(StQP)
𝑥 ≥ 0.
In spite of its simple structure, (StQP) is an NP-hard problem if 𝑄 has a
negative eigenvalue, see Pardalos and Vavasis (1991). Alternatively, NP-
problem can be formulated as (StQP): consider a graph with 𝑛 vertices. hardness of (StQP) can be seen from the fact that the maximum clique Denote its adjacency matrix by 𝐴, its clique number by 𝜔, and define
𝐽 ∶= 𝑒𝑒𝑇 . It was shown by Motzkin and Straus (1965) that
1 = min{𝑥𝑇 (𝐽 − 𝐴)𝑥 ∶ 𝑥 ∈ Δ}.	(2)
𝜔
The max clique problem is a particularly diﬃcult NP-hard problem, and even computing an approximation of any reasonable quality is NP- hard (Håstad, 1999). We will see below how copositive optimization can be used to tackle this and other NP-hard problems.
By squaring the constraint in (StQP) and applying the lifting trans- formation outlined in (1), it is easy to see that the following problem is a relaxation of (StQP):
min   𝑄, 𝑋

Conic optimization problems play a particularly fruitful role in the theory of quadratic and binary quadratic optimization problems. This is accomplished by a technique called lifting, which was pioneered
𝑋 ∈ CP ,
as is its dual problem

seen as follows: consider a quadratic expression 𝑥𝑇 𝑄𝑥 with a symmetric by Shor (1987) and Lovász and Schrijver (1991). The main idea can be matrix 𝑄 ∈ ℝ𝑛×𝑛 and 𝑥 ∈ ℝ𝑛. If we introduce a new variable 𝑋 ∈ ℝ𝑛×𝑛 to represent the rank-1 matrix 𝑥𝑥𝑇 , then we get
𝑥𝑇 𝑄𝑥 = trace(𝑥𝑇 𝑄𝑥) = trace(𝑄𝑥𝑥𝑇 ) = 𝑄, 𝑥𝑥𝑇 = 𝑄, 𝑋 .	(1)
By this technique, quadratic terms in 𝑥 ∈ ℝ𝑛 become linear terms in
𝑋 ∈ ℝ𝑛×𝑛. Since many optimization problems considered in the sequel contain nonnegativity constraints 𝑥  0, this leads to the definition of a
convex matrix cone that turns out very useful for modelling purposes: The cone of completely positive matrices is defined as
max{𝜆 ∈ ℝ ∣ 𝜆𝐽 − 𝑄 ∈ CUP}.	(4)
It is easy to verify that Slater’s condition and hence strong duality holds for (3) and (4). Since the objective function of (3) is linear and the fea- sible set is convex, it follows that the optimal solution is attained at an extreme point of the feasible set, which can be shown to be the matri-
ces of the form 𝑥𝑥𝑇 with 𝑥 ∈ Δ, cf. Bomze et al. (2000). This implies
that (3) and (4) are not merely relaxations but exact reformulations of

CP are proper cones and have been studied for decades in the linear algebra literature, see Berman and Shaked-Monderer (2003) and refer- ences therein. They have numerous interesting properties but are still not fully understood, cf. Berman et al. (2015). Note that the two cones are given in different form:   is given by its extreme rays which are

The earliest use of these cones in optimization was a paper by Preisig (1996) who studied a particular fractional quadratic problem, and by Quist et al. (1998), who were the first to introduce a conic op- timization perspective while deriving relaxations for general quadratic
𝜔 = min{𝜆 ∣ 𝜆(𝐽 − 𝐴) − 𝐽 ∈ CUP}.
Many other graph parameters have a representation as a copositive or completely positive problem. We refer to Dür (2010) for references.
Copositive optimization experienced a breakthrough with Burer’s 2009 paper Burer (2009). He showed that every quadratic problem with



linear and binary constraints can be rewritten as such a problem. More precisely, he showed that a quadratic binary problem of the form
min	𝑥𝑇 𝑄𝑥 + 2𝑐𝑇 𝑥
It goes without saying that generalized completely positive and copositive cones are even harder to work with than  or  . The ap- peal of the formulations discussed above lies in the fact that by this tech-

Similar techniques can be used to derive copositive or completely

These cones were introduced in Quist et al. (1998) and studied also in Eichfelder and Jahn (2008). As shown by Burer (2012), the problem where the nonnegativity constraints in (5) are replaced by the constraint
𝑥 ∈	is (under mild conditions) equivalent to a linear conic program
over the cone of matrices which are completely positive over ℝ+ × , i.e., over the cone conv{𝑦𝑦𝑇 ∣ 𝑦 ∈ ℝ+ × }. Eichfelder and Povh (2013),
Dickinson et al. (2013) generalize this even more to the case where is an arbitrary set, and they also give a formulation for problems involving one quadratic constraint.
When considering quadratic constraints, reformulating the problem as a conic problem becomes more involved. Burer (2009) already con- sidered certain special cases, namely binary constraints (which can
be viewed as quadratic equations 𝑥2 = 𝑥𝑖 ), and complementarity con-
straints. For more general quadratically constrained quadratic problems,
similar reformulations have been obtained: consider a quadratically con- strained quadratic problem of the form
constraints. For example, by defining an extra variable and constraint
𝑦 = 𝑥𝑗 𝑥𝑘 , the cubic term 𝑥𝑖 𝑥𝑗 𝑥𝑘 becomes the quadratic term 𝑥𝑖 𝑦. So the
reformulations discussed above can in principle be applied to polyno-
mial problems, as well. A different line of research has worked with the cone of completely positive tensors. This concept was originally intro-

tended in Kuang and Zuluaga (2018), Xia and Zuluaga (2017). We also refer to Anjos and Lasserre (2012) for more discussion on the connection between conic and polynomial optimization.

Since these cones are intractable, approxima- tions have been proposed in Kuryatnikova and Vera Lizcano (2017), Kuryatnikova and Vera (2018). This in turn has been used to derive good bounds for the underlying problems.

Approximation hierarchies for CUP and CP

Since the cones CUP and CP are computationally intractable, ap- proximations have to be used in order to solve an optimization problem

relaxation of a quadratic problem corresponds to the Lagrangian dual of that problem, whereas considering partial Lagrangian duals (i.e., du- alizing the problem only with respect to a subset of the constraints) leads to various copositive relaxations, cf. Bomze (2015). The Shor re- laxation can be improved by adding more constraints to the SDP, or by using some relaxation-linearization techniques, yielding stronger SDP- relaxations. This has been discussed in detail in Bao et al. (2011).

However, it should be clear that any inner (resp. outer) approximation hierarchy of one cone by duality yields an outer (resp. inner) approxi- mation hierarchy for the dual cone.

Inner approximation hierarchies for CUP

Parrilo (2000) was the first to propose a hierarchy approximating from the interior. The basic idea is to reformulate the copositivity condition as a nonnegativity condition for certain polynomials, and then to use the suﬃcient condition that a polynomial is nonnegative if it can

Examples of binary quadratic problems
In this section, we discuss a few combinatorial problems which can be formulated as binary quadratic optimization problems. These prob- lems are typically NP-hard, so it will be useful to consider reformula- tions and relaxations which are tractable. It will turn out that relaxations based on conic optimization are particularly useful. We will mostly focus on relaxations in the cone of positive semidefinite matrices. Throughout

We refer to the book by Lasserre (2010) and the survey by Laurent (2009) which both give excellent introductions to the general moment approach for polynomial optimization. The pa- per by Lasserre (2014) explicitly describes how to construct hierar- chies of outer approximations of	and inner approximations of

A third option is the adaptive approximation approach by Bundfuss and Dür (2009) detailed in Section 3.1 which gives the outer approximation
UP ∶= {𝐴 ∈ S ∣ 𝑣𝑇 𝐴𝑣 ≥ 0 for all vertices 𝑣 of simplices in P}.
This yields a hierarchy of polyhedral approximations that can again be tailored to either yield a uniform outer approximation of  or a finer approximation in the vicinity of the set of optimal solutions but only a coarse approximation in the remaining parts.

Therefore, inner approximations of CP can be constructed analogous

Partition and clustering problems

We briefly discuss various extensions of unconstrained binary quadratic optimization problems which lead to additional linear con- straints on the binary variables.
𝒌-cluster problems
The simplest extension of problem (10) consists in asking that exactly
𝑘 of the variables in (10) are set to 1. Let 𝐴 0 be a symmetric 𝑛 × 𝑛 matrix. We may think of 𝑎𝑖𝑗 as a measure for the interaction between 𝑖 and 𝑗. The problem

asks for a subset of 𝑘 vertices having maximum total pairwise interac-

has found increased interest from applications in data mining, see for in- stance (Fortunato, 2010). Various SDP relaxations have been discussed in Malick and Roupin (2012).
The optimal value 𝑧(𝑘) of the following optimization problem can be used to check whether 𝐺 contains a stable set of size 𝑘. As usual, 𝐴 de- notes the adjacency matrix of 𝐺. Consider the following problem which
was already briefly discussed in Section 4.2:
𝑧(𝑘) ∶= min 1 𝑥𝑇 𝐴𝑥 such that 𝑒𝑇 𝑥 = 𝑘, 𝑥 ∈ {0, 1}𝑛.	(13)
If 𝑧(𝑘) = 0, then 𝐺 contains a stable set of size 𝑘 given by 𝑆 = {𝑖 ∣ 𝑥𝑖 = 1}. On the other hand, 𝑧(𝑘) > 0 shows that 𝐺 has no stable set of size 𝑘 and therefore 𝛼(𝐺) < 𝑘.
Let us now turn to vertex colorings of 𝐺. A 𝑘-coloring of 𝑉 (𝐺) can be seen as a vertex partition of 𝑉 (𝐺) into 𝑘 stable sets (the color classes). The chromatic number 𝜒 (𝐺) denotes the smallest number 𝑘 such that
𝐺 is 𝑘-colorable. A formulation to compute 𝜒 (𝐺) as the solution of a
copositive problem was given in Gvozdenović and Laurent (2008).
Expressing 𝜒 (𝐺) as a binary optimization problem is usually done as follows. Let 𝑆 = {𝑠1, 𝑠2, …} be the collection of characteristic vectors of stable sets in 𝐺.
𝜒 (𝐺) = min ∑ 𝜆 such that ∑ 𝜆 𝑠 = 𝑒, 𝜆 ∈ {0, 1}.
	


and let 𝑘 be given. Consider the minimization problem
𝑧(𝑘) ∶= min 1 𝑥𝑇 𝐴𝑥 such that 𝑒𝑇 𝑥 = 𝑘 and 𝑥 ∈ {0, 1}𝑛.
This is a linear optimization problem in binary variables 𝜆𝑖 . Unfortu-
nately, there may be an exponential number of them. Weakening the
condition 𝜆 ∈ {0, 1} to 0  𝜆	1 for all 𝑖 leads us to the fractional chro-

𝜒 (𝐺) = min ∑ 𝜆 such that ∑ 𝜆 𝑠 = 𝑒, 0 ≤ 𝜆 ≤ 1 for all 𝑖.

Max-𝒌-Cut
The MaxCUt problem may also be seen as a very simple graph par-
tition problem as it asks to separate the vertices of the graph into two
Computing the optimal value 𝜒𝑓 (𝐺) of this linear program is again
known to be NP-hard, see for instance (Lund and Yannakakis, 1994).
Let us now consider testing whether 𝐺 contains a 𝑘-coloring for some

parts such as to maximize the weight of the edges joining the two par- tition blocks. It is a natural generalization to consider vertex partitions

𝑥𝑖𝑟 = 1

We represent 𝑘-partitions of 𝑉 = {1, … , 𝑛} by 0-1 matrices 𝑋 of or- der 𝑛 × 𝑘 satisfying 𝑋𝑒 = 𝑒. This condition simply states that (𝑋𝑒)𝑖 = 1
This condition asks that each row of 𝑋 contains exactly one entry equal
to one, so that the columns of 𝑋 provide a vertex partition of 𝑉 (𝐺) into
(at most) 𝑘 partition blocks. Since each row of 𝑋 has exactly one nonzero

for all 𝑖, meaning that vertex 𝑖 is in exactly one partition block, namely
block 𝑗 in case 𝑥𝑖𝑗 = 1. The sum of the elements of column 𝑗 of 𝑋 equals

the number of vertices (possibly zero) in partition block 𝑗. It is a sim-
ple exercise to verify that the total weight of edges joining vertices in
distinct partition blocks is given by
1 trace(𝐿𝑋𝑋𝑇 ).
𝑗 both belong to the same partition block 𝑟 for some 𝑟 ∈ {1, … , 𝑘}. As a
consequence
𝑥𝑖𝑟 𝑥𝑗𝑟 = 1 𝑋, 𝐴𝑋
[𝑖,𝑗]∈𝐸 (𝐺) 𝑟

2
Therefore, the Max-𝑘-CUt problem may be formulated as
counts the number of edges joining vertices in the same partition block. We introduce

max 1 trace(𝐿𝑋𝑋𝑇 ) such that 𝑋𝑒 = 𝑒 and 𝑋 ∈ {0, 1}𝑛×𝑘.
𝑧(𝑘) ∶= min 1
𝑋, 𝐴𝑋
such that 𝑋𝑒 = 𝑒, 𝑋 ∈ {0, 1}

The 𝒌-partition problem is obtained by further constraining the par- titions to have exactly 𝑘 partition blocks, and to require that partition block 𝑗 contains exactly 𝑚𝑗 ∈ ℕ vertices, where  𝑗 𝑚𝑗 = 𝑛. We collect the cardinalities 𝑚𝑗 in the vector 𝑚 ∈ ℕ𝑘, so that feasible partitions are represented by matrices 𝑋 ∈ {0, 1}𝑛×𝑘 satisfying
𝑋𝑒 = 𝑒 and 𝑋𝑇 𝑒 = 𝑚.
The special case where all the 𝑚𝑖 are equal is of special interest
in certain telecommunication problems, and we refer to Lisser and
Rendl (2003) for a discussion of these applications and relaxations based on semidefinite optimization.
Stable sets and graph coloring

We briefly look at formulations for the stability and the chromatic number of a graph in connection with quadratic binary optimization.
A subset 𝑆 of vertices of a graph 𝐺 is called stable (or independent),
if the subgraph of 𝐺 induced by 𝑆 is empty. The stability number 𝛼(𝐺)
denotes the cardinality of a largest stable set in 𝐺. Determining 𝛼(𝐺) is
considered an extremely diﬃcult combinatorial optimization problem,
cf. Håstad (1999). The following binary quadratic optimization problem
determines 𝛼(𝐺):

In a slight abuse of notation, we use 𝑧(𝑘) again for the optimal value of the relaxation with exactly 𝑘 columns in 𝑋. If 𝑧(𝑘) = 0, then the optimal

Quadratic set cover

set 𝐶 ∶= {𝑣1, … , 𝑣𝑛 } of 𝑛 elements and a collection 𝑆 of 𝑚 subsets of 𝐶 The (linear) set cover problem is defined as follows. We are given a such that their union equals 𝐶. Each subset 𝑆𝑖 in 𝑆 has cost 𝑞𝑖 . The task is to select subsets in 𝑆 such that their union is 𝐶 and such that the cost
of the selected subsets in minimized. This problem is one of Karp’s 21 NP-complete problems.
To state this problem formally, define an 𝑛 × 𝑚 binary matrix 𝐴 with
𝑎𝑖𝑗 = 1 if 𝑣𝑖 ∈ 𝑆𝑗 . Row 𝑖 of 𝐴 indicates which subsets 𝑆𝑗 contain 𝑣𝑖 , col- umn 𝑗 of 𝐴 is the incidence vector of subset 𝑆𝑗 . With this, the linear set

Let us denote the largest row sum of 𝐴 by 𝑓 and the largest col- umn sum of 𝐴 by 𝑔. The following approximation results go back to the
1980’s. Hochbaum (1982) introduces a primal-dual LP-rounding heuris- tic which gives (in polynomial time) a feasible solution to set cover

To this end, it is useful to vec(𝑋) is a vector obtained from the matrix 𝑋 by stacking the columns of 𝑋 on top of each other.

We may think of these constraints as asking that each vertex should re- ceive color 1 or 2 or 3. Thus we do not allow that all three of these vari- ables are zero but more than one of them may be set to one. Escoﬃer and

Theorem 4.1. Let 𝐺 be a nonbipartite graph and consider
𝑦 = diag(𝑌 ), 𝑌 − 𝑦𝑦𝑇 ⪰ 0.
Since 𝑌 takes the role of 𝑥𝑥𝑇 we may think of the 𝑛2 × 𝑛2 matrix 𝑌 as

𝑧∗ ∶= min	∑

all 𝑘 ≠ 𝑙. In a similar way we conclude that diag(𝑌 𝑖,𝑗 ) = 0 for 𝑖 ≠ 𝑗. We
refer to Povh and Rendl (2009) for further details.

Then 𝑧∗ = 0 if and only if 𝜒 (𝐺) = 3.
As a consequence, it is NP-hard to decide whether a quadratic set cover problem has optimal value 0 or greater than 0. The covering prob- lem in this construction is quite simple. Each set consists of only one
element (𝑆𝑖𝑟 = {𝑖}), and each cover constraint involves only three ele-
ments from the ground set. This problem would therefore be trivial to
solve with a linear objective function.

The QAP then reads:

Modelling linear equalities and inequalities in SDP relaxations

In this section we take a closer look at modelling issues related to combinatorial optimization problems. We stress that formulations which are equivalent in the binary setting may give different results when we move to conic relaxations. For instance, suppose we have binary vari-
ables 𝑥𝑖 ∈ {0, 1} and we would like to express the constraint that for a
given pair 𝑖, 𝑗 at most one of the associated variables 𝑥𝑖 and 𝑥𝑗 is al-
inequality 𝑥𝑖 + 𝑥𝑗  1 or by requiring the quadratic equation 𝑥 𝑥 = 0 to lowed to be equal to 1. This could be done either by imposing the linear
hold. In the binary setting, both conditions are equivalent, but once we move to relaxations, they may yield different results.
Moreover, various ways of constructing SDP relaxations have been proposed in the literature which may also lead to bounds of varying quality. We refer to Anjos et al. (2021) for a recent discussion of various SDP models related to the stable set problem.
Finally, the idea of using approximation hierarchies as detailed in Section 3 has found a lot of interest. Applied to combinatorial optimiza-

in matrices of order 𝑛 + 1, but already the second level uses matrices of nary variables, the SDP in the first level of the hierarchy is formulated order 𝑛 which is prohibitive once 𝑛 is much larger than 100.



Lifting linear constraints
Next we investigate the situation where a linear term 𝑎𝑇 𝑥 is required

we consider the SDP relaxation of

The semidefiniteness constraint 𝑋 − 𝑥𝑥𝑇 ⪰ 0 with diag(𝑋) = 𝑥 im-
mediately shows that
𝑎𝑇 𝑋𝑎 ≥ (𝑎𝑇 𝑥)2 .
We conclude that 𝑎2 ≥ 𝑎𝑇 𝑋𝑎 is at least as strong as the original inequal- ity 𝑎𝑇 𝑥 ≥ 𝑎 .	0
Finally,	observe that the situation is different for one-sided linear inequalities of the form
𝑎𝑇 𝑥 ≥ 𝑎0
with 𝑎0 > 0. Arguing as before we see that
𝑎𝑇 𝑋𝑎 ≥ (𝑎𝑇 𝑥)2 ,
hence the original inequality 𝑎𝑇 𝑥 ≥ 𝑎0 is at least as strong as 𝑎𝑇 𝑋𝑎 ≥ 𝑎2.

Since we should have equality it seems plausible to optimize over the set
T1 ∶= {(𝑋, 𝑥) ∣ ( 𝑋	𝑥) ⪰ 0, diag(𝑋) = 𝑥, 𝑎𝑇 𝑥 = 𝑎0 , 𝑎𝑇 𝑋𝑎 = 𝑎2}.
Stable set and coloring relaxations
We recall the formulation for the stability number 𝛼(𝐺) for a graph



Unfortunately, this construction makes feasible matrices singular, as we show in the next lemma:
Lemma 5.1. Let (𝑋, 𝑥) ∈ T1. Then the matrix ( 𝑋	𝑥) is singular and
𝑋𝑎 = 𝑎0𝑥.
Proof. We first note that
( 𝑎 )𝑇 ( 𝑋	𝑥)( 𝑎 )

It is well known that the set of singular positive semidefinite matri-
ces equals the boundary of  + and the set of positive definite matrices
𝑥	1

equals the interior of S+.  𝑛	Lemma 5.1 implies that if we work with the set  1 in an SDP-relaxation, then the Slater condition is nec-
essarily violated, and we already saw that this is disadvantageous both from a theoretical perspective (strong duality may not hold) and from a practical perspective (solvers may not be able to handle the problem). As an alternative, we propose the set
T2 ∶= {(𝑋, 𝑥) ∣ 𝑋 ⪰ 0, diag(𝑋) = 𝑥, 𝑎𝑇 𝑥 = 𝑎0 , 𝑋𝑎 = 𝑎0 𝑥}.
A formulation similar to T2 appeared in Burer, 2010, Proposition 1.
We next show that the two sets are actually equal:
We now return to the parameter 𝑧(𝑘) from (13) and derive upper bounds on 𝛼(𝐺) based on it. We denote by 𝐴 the adjacency matrix of our graph 𝐺. For given 𝑘 ∈ ℕ we have
𝑧(𝑘) ∶= min 1 𝑥𝑇 𝐴𝑥 such that 𝑒𝑇 𝑥 = 𝑘 and 𝑥 ∈ {0, 1}𝑛.
If 𝑧(𝑘) > 0, then clearly 𝐺 has no stable set of size 𝑘 and there- fore 𝛼(𝐺) < 𝑘. Computing 𝑧(𝑘) is an NP-complete problem, see for in-
tractable  relaxation  denoted  by  𝑃 (𝑡)  for  some  𝑡  >  1: stance (Billionnet and Roupin, 2008), so we consider the following
𝑃 (𝑡)  min 1 𝐴, 𝑌 such that 𝑌 ⪰ 0, 𝑌 ≥ 0, trace(𝑌 ) = 𝑡, 𝑌 𝑒 = 𝑡diag(𝑌 )

Lemma 5.2. We have that T1 = T2.
Proof. We first take (𝑋, 𝑥) ∈ T1. Then 𝑋 ⪰ 0, diag(𝑋) = 𝑥 and 𝑎𝑇 𝑥 = 𝑎0 .
Lemma 5.1 shows that 𝑋𝑎 = 𝑎0𝑥 and therefore (𝑋, 𝑥) ∈ T2.
Note that this is a doubly nonnegative relaxation, since the constraints
𝑌 ⪰ 0, 𝑌	0 mean that 𝑌 should be in the cone of doubly nonnega-
tive matrices. We denote the optimal value of 𝑃 (𝑡) by val(𝑃 (𝑡)). Note

that val(𝑃 (𝑡)) > 0 implies 𝛼(𝐺) ≤ 𝑡 , so we are interested in finding the

Conversely, let (𝑋, 𝑥) ∈ T2. We immediately get that 𝑎𝑇 𝑥 = 𝑎0 and

We are now ready to show the following result.
Theorem 5.5. Let 𝐴 be the adjacency matrix of a graph 𝐺. Then val(𝑃 (𝑡)) >
val(𝑃 (𝑡)) > 0 if and only if 𝑡 < 𝜗−(𝐺).

Proof. We first consider problem 𝑃 (𝑡) for 𝑡 = 𝜗−(𝐺). Let 𝑌 be an optimal solution for 𝜗−(𝐺). Then 𝑌 is also feasible for 𝑃 (𝜗−(𝐺)) with value 0, so
𝑃 (𝜗−(𝐺)) = 0. The solution 𝑌 remains feasible for any 𝑡′ > 𝑡 = 𝜗−(𝐺) so that val(𝑃 (𝑡′)) = 0 also in this case. Finally, the definition of 𝜗−(𝐺) shows that for any 𝑡 < 𝜗−(𝐺), the system

𝑖𝑗
= 0 for all [𝑖, 𝑗] ∈ 𝐸(𝐺), 𝑦
𝑖𝑗
≥ 0 for all [𝑖, 𝑗] ∉ 𝐸(𝐺).

Lemma 5.4 shows us that 𝑌 𝑒 = 𝜗+𝑦. We conclude that (𝑌 , 𝑦) is feasible for problem 𝑃 (𝜗+). Since 𝑦𝑖𝑗 = 0 on 𝐸(𝐺) we conclude that val(𝑃 (𝜗+)) = 0.
Next, suppose that val(𝑃 (𝑡)) = 0 and consider 𝑡′ with 1 < 𝑡′ < 𝑡. Sup-
pose that (𝑌 , 𝑦) is optimal for 𝑃 (𝑡). It is a simple exercise to verify that
𝑌 ′ ∶=   𝑡′  [(𝑡′ − 1)𝑌 + (𝑡 − 𝑡′)diag(𝑌 )]
is feasible for 𝑃 (𝑡′) with objective value 0, hence val(𝑃 (𝑡)) = 0 for all
1 < 𝑡  𝜗+.
Finally, the definition of problem (S1) shows that 𝜗+ is the largest possible value for the trace of a matrix 𝑌 which satisfies 𝑌 ⪰ 0, 𝑌
0, 𝑦𝑖𝑗 = 0 for all [𝑖, 𝑗] ∈ 𝐸(𝐺), and therefore val(𝑃 (𝑡)) > 0 for any 𝑡 >

If 𝑧(𝑘) > 0 for some given 𝑘, then 𝜒 (𝐺) > 𝑘. As before, we need a tractable
Conclusions

We have seen that conic optimization is an extremely versatile tool with an abundance of applications. Depending on the cone in question, different complexities may occur: while linear programming, second or- der cone programming as well as semidefinite programming are solvable in polynomial time, optimizing over the cones of copositive or com- pletely positive matrices is NP-hard.
The cones	and are highly useful modelling tools for non- convex quadratic or combinatorial optimization. In many cases, it is possible to reformulate such problems equivalently as linear problems over	or . Relaxing the cone constraint to a semidefiniteness or double nonnegativity constraints yields very good bounds which are of- ten provably tighter than LP-based bounds. When using approximation hierarchies, one can often show that some finite level of the hierarchy gives the exact solution of the underlying combinatorial problem.
In this paper, we have discussed various conic approaches to binary quadratic problems. It is noteworthy that not much literature is avail- able for conic approaches to nonconvex quadratic problems involving general integer or mixed integer variables, i.e., problems with a vari-
able 𝑥 ∈ ℝ𝑝 × ℤ𝑟 . This type of problems is studied in Burer and Letch-

In contrast to linear programming, the existence of strictly feasible solutions plays a crucial role in conic optimization. In the absence of strictly feasible points, strong duality may not hold and algorithms may
fail to solve the problem. This is therefore a point that should be care-

because each row of the 0-1 matrix 𝑋 has exactly one entry equal to 1. A relaxation is obtained by allowing arbitrary matrices 𝑌 instead of 𝑋𝑋𝑇 .

conic optimization in a broader context of applications is the lack of algorithms that can solve large scale problems in reasonable time.
Semidefinite relaxations of a problem in ℝ𝑛 clearly involve matrices of
order at least 𝑛 × 𝑛, so the number of variables is roughly squared. If

trix ∗-algebras. Roughly speaking, the idea is to pre-process the SDP highly structured is to exploit the symmetry by using the theory of ma-
by applying a suitable unitary transformation in such a way that the resulting matrices in the SDP exhibit block diagonal structure. This



structure can then be exploited by interior point methods. We refer to de Klerk (2010) for a survey on this approach, and to Dobre and Vera (2015) for a discussion on how it can be used in approximation hierarchies.
Unfortunately however, not all SDPs exhibit symmetries, and so there is a need for faster algorithms. Maybe in the future other al- gorithms than interior point methods will turn out to be eﬃcient. First attempts are a semismooth Newton-CG augmented Lagrangian method (Yang et al., 2015) and an augmented Lagrangian method com- bined with a suitable randomization technique (Yurtsever et al., 2021). The ADMM method has already proved successful when applied to SDP relaxations of binary quadratic problems (Wen et al., 2010), the quadratic assignment problem (Oliveira et al., 2018), or the quadratic shortest path problem (Hu and Sotirov, 2020).
As we have outlined, the past decades have seen an enormous progress in understanding conic problems and using them for modelling purposes. The next decades should be particularly devoted to the nu- merical side.
