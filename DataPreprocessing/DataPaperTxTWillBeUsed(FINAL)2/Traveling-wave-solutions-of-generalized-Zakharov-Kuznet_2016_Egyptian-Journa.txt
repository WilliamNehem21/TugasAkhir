In this article, we established abundant traveling wave solutions for nonlinear evolution equa- tions. The exp(–φ(η))-expansion method is used to construct traveling wave solutions for the generalized Zakharov–Kuznetsov–Benjamin–Bona–Mahony equation and Simplified Modi- fied form of Camassa–Holm equation. The traveling wave solutions are expressed in terms of the hyperbolic functions, the trigonometric functions and the rational functions.

Introduction

It is well known that seeking exact solutions [1–53] for non- linear evolution equations (NLEES) plays an important role in mathematical physics. For instance, nonlinear evolution equa- tions (NEEs) are widely used as models to describe complex physical phenomena in various fields of sciences, especially
in fluid mechanics, solid-state physics, plasma physics, plasma waves and biology. One of the basic physical problems for those models is to obtain their travelling wave solutions. In particu- lar, various methods have been utilized to explore different kinds of solutions of physical models described by nonlinear partial differential equations (NPDEs). In the past few decades or so, many effective methods have been presented, which contain the inverse scattering transform method, the Backlund

Some recently developed methods, such as, the
