Abstract
Self-adjoint operators and their spectra play a crucial rˆole in analysis and physics. Therefore, it is a natural question whether the spectrum of a self-adjoint operator and its eigenvalues can be computed from a description of the operator. We prove that given a “program” of the operator one can obtain positive information on the spectrum as a compact set in the sense that a dense subset of the spectrum can be enumerated and a bound on the set can be computed. This generalizes some non-uniform results obtained by Pour-El and Richards, which imply that the spectrum of any computable self-adjoint operator is a recursively enumerable compact set. Additionally, we show that the eigenvalues of self-adjoint operators can be computed in the sense that we can compute a list of indices such that those elements of the already computed dense subset of the spectrum, whose indices are not enumerated in this list, form the set of eigenvalues. Beside these main results we prove some computability results about the operational calculus, which we need in our proofs.
Keywords: Computable functional analysis, Hilbert spaces, self-adjoint operators, spectrum and eigenvalues, operational calculus, TTE.


Introduction
A linear operator T : H → H on a Hilbert space H over some field F ∈ {C, R} is called self-adjoint, if T = T ∗ where T ∗ is the adjoint operator of T , which is the unique operator that satisfies ⟨Tx, y⟩ = ⟨x, T ∗y⟩. Any self-adjoint operator is normal, which means that T ∗T = TT ∗ holds. We will apply all these notions also to partial operators T :⊆ H → H, but in this case we additionally demand that dom(T ) is dense in H.
The spectrum σ(T ) of a bounded operator T ∈ B(H) is the set of all values
λ ∈ F such that λ − T has no inverse in the set B(H) of bounded linear operators

T : H → H. In particular, all eigenvalues of T , i.e. all λ ∈ F such that there exists a non-zero x ∈ H with Tx = λx, are elements of the spectrum. The spectrum of a bounded linear operator is known to be a compact set and in absolute value it is bounded by ||T || = sup||x||=1 ||T x||, i.e. by the operator norm of the corresponding operator T ∈ B(H). For self-adjoint operators the spectrum is known to be real,
i.e. σ(T ) ⊆ R (see [10] for statements regarding linear operators on Hilbert spaces).
¿From the perspective of computable analysis a natural question is whether the spectrum and the eigenvalues of a self-adjoint operator can be computed in some natural sense. In general, there are at least two variants of such a result, which could be of interest, a uniform and a non-uniform one:
(Uniform) the maps T '→ σ(T ) and/or T '→ σp(T ) are computable, 2
(Non-uniform) σ(T ) and/or σp(T ) are computable for any computable T .
It is clear that any uniform result implies the corresponding non-uniform one (as computable maps map computable inputs to computable outputs). However, in general the uniform result is much stronger. What complicates things here is that the spectrum and also the operator might be computable in different senses. Re- garding operators we will typically represent them in a way, which corresponds to programs (i.e. we will rather use the compact-open topology and not the op- erator norm topology). Regarding compact subsets, we will consider a variant of computability, which includes positive information on the compact set.
The main result of this paper, presented in Section 4, is that for self-adjoint op- erators in complex Hilbert spaces we obtain the following uniform and non-uniform results:
(Uniform) the map T '→ σ(T ) is lower semi-computable (that is computable with respect to positive information on σ(T )),
(Uniform) the map T '→ σp(T ) is computable in the sense that we can enu- merate a sequence in σ(T ) and a list of indices such that those elements of the sequence whose indices are not enumerated in the list form the set of eigenval- ues of T ,
(Non-uniform) σ(T ) is a recursively enumerable compact set for any com- putable T ,
(Non-uniform) all eigenvalues are computable reals for any computable T . The non-uniform version of this result also follows from the Second Main Theo-
rem of Pour-El and Richards [9,8]. In [4] we have already proved a result correspond-
ing to the first “uniform” item. But here we present another proof for this result, which is similar to the proof in [9] and gives us the possibility to obtain also some information about the eigenvalues. In [4] we also proved that the result for σ(T ) cannot be strengthened to recursive compactness, because any recursively enumer- able compact set can be represented as the spectrum of some computable normal operator. This is in contrast to the finite-dimensional case where the spectrum map

2 By σp(T ) we denote the point spectrum of T , i.e. the set of all eigenvalues of T .

T '→ σ(T ) is computable in a stronger sense [13,14].
For the proof of our main results we need a computable version of the operational calculus, which we derive in Section 3. In Section 5 we introduce some “prerequi- sites” that we need for the proof of the main result, namely triangle functions and the norms of the operational calculus. Most of the technical part of the proof is done in Section 6 where we define two auxiliary mappings, which have some interesting properties and do the main part of computing the spectrum. We finish the proof of our main result in Section 7.
In the following Section 2 we briefly introduce some required notions from com- putable analysis, the Turing machine based theory of computability and complexity, which is the approach that we will use throughout this paper (see [9,7,11] for com- prehensive introductions).

Computable Hilbert Spaces
In this section we briefly introduce the required tools from computable analysis, which we will use in the following. For a more comprehensive introduction the reader is referred to [11] and the other cited references. We will not introduce notions from functional analysis here and the reader is referred to standard textbooks in this case. In the following we will discuss operators T :⊆ H → H on Hilbert spaces H and we are in particular interested in computable Hilbert spaces, which we define below (the inclusion symbol “⊆” indicates that T might be partial). In general we assume that H is defined over the field F, which might either be R or C. Throughout the
paper, we assume that H =/	{0}.
Definition 2.1 A computable Hilbert space (H, ⟨.⟩, e) is a separable Hilbert space (H, ⟨.⟩) together with a fundamental sequence e : N → H (i.e. the closure of the linear span of range(e) is dense in H) such that the induced normed space is a computable normed space.
The induced normed space is the normed space with the norm given by
||x|| := ⟨x, x⟩. A computable normed space is a normed space such that the metric d induced by d(x, y) := ||x − y|| together with the sequence αe : N → H, de-
fined by αe⟨k, ⟨n0, ..., nk⟩⟩ := Σk	αF(ni)ei, form a computable metric space such
that the linear operations (vector space addition and scalar multiplication) become
computable. Here αF is a standard numbering of QF where QF = Q in case of F = R and QF = Q[i] in case of F = C. We assume that there is some n ∈ N with αF(n) = 0. Without loss of generality, we can even assume that (en)n∈N is an orthonormal basis of H. A computable metric space X is a separable metric space together with a sequence α : N → X such that range(α) is dense in X and d ◦(α× α) is a computable (double) sequence of reals.
If not mentioned otherwise, then we assume that all computable Hilbert spaces H are represented by their Cauchy representation δH (of the induced computable metric space). The Cauchy representation δ :⊆ Σω → X of a computable metric space X is defined such that a sequence p ∈ Σω represents a point x ∈ X, if it

encodes a sequence (α(ni))i∈N that rapidly converges to x, where rapid means that d(α(ni), α(nj)) < 2−j for all i > j. Here Σω denotes the set of infinite sequences over some finite set Σ (the alphabet ) and Σω is endowed with the product topology with respect to the discrete topology on Σ. All computability statements with respect to Hilbert spaces are to be understood with respect to the Cauchy representation. In general a representation of a set X is a surjective map δ :⊆ Σω → X. Here the inclusion symbol “⊆” indicates that the corresponding map might be partial. Given representations δ :⊆ Σω → X and δ' :⊆ Σω → Y , a map f :⊆ X → Y is called (δ, δ')–computable, if there exists a computable map F :⊆ Σω → Σω such that δ'F (p)= fδ(p) for all p ∈ dom(fδ). Analogously, one can define computability for multi-valued functions f :⊆ X ⇒ Y . In this case the equation above has to
be replaced by the condition δ'F (p) ∈ fδ(p). Here a function F :⊆ Σω → Σω is
called computable if there exists a Turing machine which computes F . Similarly, one can define the concept of continuity with respect to representations, where the computable function F is replaced by a continuous function.
Cauchy representations of computable metric spaces X are known to be admissi- ble and for such representations continuity with respect to representations coincides with ordinary continuity. If X, Y are computable metric spaces, then we assume that the space C(X, Y ) of continuous functions f : X → Y is represented by [δX → δY ], which is a canonical function space representation. This representation satisfies two characteristic properties, evaluation and type conversion, which can be performed computably (see [11] for details). If Y = F, then we write for short C(X)= C(X, F).
It is clear that the inner product of any computable Hilbert space is a computable map.
Proposition 2.2 The inner product ⟨.⟩ : H× H → F, (x, y) '→ ⟨x, y⟩ of any com- putable Hilbert space H is computable.
Proof. This follows from the fact that the norm ||.|| : H → R is a computable map for any computable normed space and the fact that the inner product satisfies the polar identities


in case of F = R and
⟨x, y⟩ =
1 (||x + y||2 − ||x − y||2)
4

⟨x, y⟩ =
1 (||x + y||2 − ||x − y||2 + i||x + iy||2 − i||x − iy||2)
4

for F = C.	 
By δF and δR we denote standard representations of F and R, respectively. For the countable sets N and Z we use standard notations νN and νZ, respectively.
The Computable Operational Calculus
In the proof of their Second Main Theorem Pour-El and Richards use some prop- erties of the operational calculus to compute a dense sequence in the spectrum of a self-adjoint operator and to distinguish between elements of the continuous

spectrum and eigenvalues [9]. Thus we need some computability results about the operational calculus to obtain a uniform version of the proof.

Continuous Functions with Compact Domain
For the main result in this section, we need a representation for the partial contin- uous functions from R to F (not only for those with a common fixed domain). As it is impossible to obtain such a representation for the set of all these functions, we restrict ourselves to the set of continuous functions with nonempty compact domain. In the following we denote the set of all compact subsets of R by K := {K ⊆
R | K compact} and the set of all nonempty compact subsets by K∗ := K \ {∅}. Given a set A ⊆ R, we define C(A) := C(A, F). As we only use this notion C(A) in conjunction with a Hilbert space H, it will always be clear what set we mean by
C(A). Given A ∈ K∗ we use the supremum norm f ∞ := maxx∈A |f (x)| on C(A).
Definition 3.1 We denote the set of all polynomials on R with rational coefficients by

Pn :=
 f ∈ C(R) | ∃n ∈ N ∃a0,... , an ∈ QF ∀t ∈ R : f (t)= 
Σi=0

aiti	.

Let νPn be some standard notation of Pn. Given some nonempty compact set A ⊆ R, we denote the set of all polynomials with rational coefficients and domain A by
PnA := {p♩A | p ∈ Pn}	with	A ∈ K∗ .
Let νPnA be the standard notation of PnA derived from νPn:
νPnA (w)= p : ⇐⇒ νPn(w)= q and p = q♩A
for w ∈ Σ∗, p ∈ PnA and q ∈ Pn.
For any nonempty compact subset A ⊆ R the set PnA is dense in the space (C(A),  ∞) (The Stone-Weierstrass theorem). Thus using the notation νPnA , we can define a Cauchy representation of C(A), i.e. the set of all continuous functions with common compact domain A ∈ K∗ (see also [11]).
Definition 3.2 [Cauchy representation of C(A)] For any nonempty compact set

A ⊆ R, we define the Cauchy representation δA
of C(A) by

δA (p)= f : ⇐⇒ p = ι(w0)ι(w1) ... , such that
νPn (wi) − νPn (wk)  ∞ < 2−i for i < k
and f = lim νPnA (wi).
i→∞
That is, a name of a function in C(A) consists of a rapidly converging sequence of polynomials with rational coefficients. Now we can define a representation for the set of all continuous functions with compact domain.

Definition 3.3 [Representation of CK(⊆ R)] We denote the set of all continuous functions f :⊆ R → F with nonempty compact domain dom(f ) ∈ K∗ by

CK(⊆ R) :=
A∈K∗
C(A) .

We define a representation δCp of the set CK(⊆ R) of continuous functions f :⊆ R →
F with compact domain by
δCp⟨p, q⟩ = f : ⇐⇒ κ(q)= dom(f ) /= ∅ and δκ(q)(p)= f . 
That is, a name of a continuous function f with compact domain contains two types of information, a name q of the domain dom(f ) of f as a compact subset of R and a name p of f as a continuous map with (fixed) compact domain as a rapidly converging sequence of polynomials with rational coefficients. Here by κ we denote the standard representation of K using positive and negative information (see [11]). If not mentioned otherwise, we will assume that CK(⊆ R) is represented by δCp.
Given a a total continuous function f : R → F and a nonempty compact subset
K ∈ K∗, we can compute the restriction f ♩K ∈ CK(⊆ R).
Proposition 3.4 The mapping
F :⊆ C(R) ×K → CK(⊆ R), (f, K) '→ f ♩K
with dom(f ) := C(R) × K∗ is ([[δR → δF] , κ] , δCp)-computable.
Proof. Given f ∈ C(R), K ∈ K∗, we systematically search a polynomial pn ∈ Pn such that  f ♩K − pn♩K  ∞ < 2−n with n ∈ N. This can be done computably and uniformly in n (Effective Weierstraß Theorem, [11]). The sequence of all these polynomials forms a name of f ♩K ∈ CK(⊆ R).	 
On the other hand, given a function f ∈ CK(⊆ R) we can obtain a rapidly converging sequence of polynomials and the domain of f , as both information are encoded in a name of f .
Lemma 3.5 The multi-valued mapping
F1 : CK(⊆ R) ⇒ PnN
with
(pn)n∈N ∈ F1(f ): ⇐⇒ pi♩dom(f ) − pk♩dom(f )  ∞ < 2−i for i < k and
f = lim pi♩dom(f )
i→∞
is δCp, νN  -computable, and the mapping


is (δCp, κ)-computable.
F2 : CK(⊆ R) ⇒ K, f '→ dom(f )

Computability of the Continuous Operational Calculus
In this section we use the operational calculus as it is defined in [12, VII.1.3/4], though we denote the operational calculus corresponding to an operator T by ΦT

(and not by Φ) to point out the dependency between ΦT and T . In particular, we use the derivation of the continuous operational calculus as the unique contin- uous extension of the mapping (T, p) '→ p(T ) defined for operators T ∈ B(H) and polynomials p. Here we briefly state some statements about the operational calculus
Proposition 3.6 (Continuous Operational Calculus [12]) Let H be a com- plex Hilbert space and T ∈ B(H) be self-adjoint. Then there exists a unique mapping ΦT : C(σ(T )) → B(H) such that
ΦT (t)= T , ΦT (1)= id,
ΦT is linear,
ΦT (f · g)= ΦT (f ) ◦ ΦT (g),

ΦT (f )= ΦT (f )∗,
ΦT is continuous.
Instead of ΦT (f ) we also write f (T ). Additionally, ΦT has the following properties:
p(T )= Σn aiT i for every polynomial p with p(t)= Σn	aiti.
f (T ) = f ∞(= supλ∈σ(T ) |f (λ)|).
Tx = λx implies f (T )x = f (λ)x.
σ(f (T )) = f (σ(T ))(= {f (λ) | λ ∈ σ(T )}).
The operational calculus can be extended such that it is defined for measurable functions f . We only need this extension in the way that we can transfer some results regarding characteristic functions and the spectrum to the here used contin- uous triangle functions: Given a sequence (fn)n∈N of measurable functions defined on σ(T ) that converges pointwise to a function f and is uniformly bounded, the sequence (fn(T ))n∈N converges pointwise to f (T ).
Given a computable normed space X, δB(X) := [δX → δX ] |B(X) is a representa- tion of the space B(X) of all linear bounded operators T : X → X. If not mentioned otherwise, we will assume that B(X) is represented by δB(X).
First we prove that given an operator T and polynomial p we can compute the operator p(T )= ΦT (p).
Lemma 3.7 Let X be a computable normed space. Then the mapping
P :⊆ B(X) × Pn → B(X), (T, p) '→ p(T )
is  δB(X), νPn , δB(X) -computable.
	 
Proof. The mapping (T, n) '→ T n is	δB(X), νN , δB(X) -computable, and B(X) together with the representation δB(X) is a computable vector space. Thus we can
compute Σn	aiT i = p(T ).	 
By the definitions of ΦT (see [12, VII.1.3/4]) and P we have

ΦT (f )  = f ∞ = sup
λ∈σ(T )
|f (λ)|

for self-adjoint T ∈ B(H) and functions f ∈ C(σ(T )), and furthermore the (in)equalities

P (T, p)  = ΦT (p♩σ(T ))  =  sup
λ∈σ(T )
|p(λ)| ≤ sup |p(λ)| = p♩K  ∞
λ∈K

for self-adjoint T ∈ B(H), p ∈ Pn and nonempty K ∈K such that σ(T ) ⊆ K. Since
P is linear in the second component it follows that
P (T, p1) − p(T, p2)  = P (T, p1 − p2)  ≤ (p1 − p2)♩K  ∞ = p1♩K − p2♩K  ∞
for self-adjoint T ∈ B(H), p1, p2 ∈ Pn and nonempty K ∈K such that σ(T ) ⊆ K. Due to these estimations the following lemma holds.
Lemma 3.8 Let H be a computable complex Hilbert space. By Lim :⊆ B(H)N → B(H) we denote the mapping deﬁned by
dom(Lim) := (Tn)n∈N ∈ B(H)N | Ti − Tk  < 2−i for i < k,

and

Lim ((Tn)n∈N)= T : ⇐⇒  lim
n→∞

Tn = T

for (Tn)n∈N ∈ dom(Lim). Let T ∈ B(H) be self-adjoint and f ∈ CK(⊆ R) such that
σ(T ) ⊆ dom(f ). Then we have
(P (T, pn))n∈N ∈ dom(Lim)

and

ΦT (f ♩σ(T ))= Lim((P (T, pn))n∈N)

for all sequences (pn)n∈N ∈ F1(f ). 3
Proof. Let T ∈ B(H) be self-adjoint, f ∈ CK(⊆ R) such that σ(T ) ⊆ dom(f ) and (pn)n∈N ∈ F1(f ). Then by the definition of F1 we obtain
pi♩dom(f ) − pk♩dom(f )  ∞ < 2−i for i < k. Due to the previous estimations it follows
P (T, pi) − P (T, pk)   ≤ pi♩dom(f ) − pk♩dom(f )  ∞ < 2−i
for i < k. Thus (P (T, pn))n∈N ∈ dom(Lim). By the continuity of ΦT we obtain

lim
n→∞
P (T, pn) = lim
n→∞
ΦT (pn♩σ(T ))= ΦT	lim
n→∞
pn♩σ(T ) = ΦT (f ♩σ(T ))

because of σ(T ) ⊆ dom(f ). Hence it follows
ΦT (f ♩σ(T ))= Lim((P (T, pn))n∈N) .

In particular, all sequences (pn)n∈N of polynomials that converge rapidly to f ∈ C(R) on a compact superset of σ(T ) result in the same limit ΦT (f ♩σ(T )) of ((P (T, pn))n∈N).

3 Here by F1 we denote the mapping defined in Lemma 3.5.

Theorem 3.9 Let H be a computable complex Hilbert space. Then the mapping
Φ :⊆ B(H) × CK(⊆ R) → B(H), (T, f ) '→ ΦT (f ♩σ(T ))
with domain
dom(Φ) := {(T, f ) ∈ B(H) × CK(⊆ R) | T is self-adjoint and σ(T ) ⊆ dom(f )}
is	δB(H), δCp , δB(H) -computable.
Proof. Given f ∈ CK(⊆ R) we can obtain a rapidly converging sequence of poly- nomials pn with limn→∞ pn = f as such a sequence is encoded in the name of f (see Lemma 3.5). By Lemma 3.8 we have Lim((P (T, pn))n∈N)) = ΦT (f ♩σ(T )) for each such sequence (pn)n∈N. Given a sequence (pn)n∈N ∈ PnN we can compute the sequence (P (T, pn))n∈N) ∈ B(H)N. (B(H),  , δB(H)) is a general computable Ba- nach space [2]. Hence (T, (pn)n∈N) '→ Lim((P (T, pn))n∈N)) is δB(H), νN , δB(H) - computable. As mentioned before, the result of Lim((P (T, pn))n∈N))) only depends on T ∈ B(H) and f ∈ CK(⊆ R), but not on the particular sequence (pn)n∈N ∈ F1(f ) that the machine realizing F1 computes from the given name of f . Thus we can compute Φ as a single-valued function although we have to use the multi-valued function F1 during our computation.	 
Now, we obtain a computable version of the operational calculus as a simple corollary. We just have to restrict the domain of Φ.
Corollary 3.10 Let H be a computable complex Hilbert space. Then the mapping
Φorg :⊆ B(H) × CK(⊆ R) → B(H), (T, f ) '→ ΦT (f ♩σ(T ))
with domain
dom(Φorg) := {(T, f ) ∈ B(H) × CK(⊆ R) | T is self-adjoint and
σ(T )= dom(f )}
is  δB(H), δCp , δB(H) -computable.
In the next section, we need another computable version of the operational calculus, namely one that expects a function f ∈ C(R) instead of a function f ∈ CK(⊆ R) (and of course also expects an operator T ∈ B(H)).
Proposition 3.11 Let H be a computable complex Hilbert space. Then the mapping
ΦC(R) :⊆ B(H) × C(R) → B(H), (T, f ) '→ ΦT (f ♩σ(T ))

with

dom(ΦC(R)) := {T ∈ B(H) | T is self-adjoint}× C(R)

is  δB(H), [δR → δF] , δB(H) -computable.
Proof. Given T ∈ B(H) we can compute an upper bound M ∈ N of  T  [1,3]. Furthermore the mapping M '→ [−M, M ] is (νN, κ)-computable and [−M, M ] /= ∅. Since σ(T ) ⊆ [−T , T ] ⊆ [−M, M ] for self-adjoint T ∈ B(H), we can compute a compact nonempty superset of σ(T ). Then by Proposition 3.4 we can compute

f ♩[−M,M ] ∈ CK(⊆ R). As [−M, M ] is superset of σ(T ) we have (T, f ♩[−M,M ]) ∈
dom(Φ), and by Theorem 3.9 we can compute ΦT (f ♩σ(T )). 4	 
Now we obtain the computability of the map T '→ ΦT as a corollary of Propo- sition 3.11, if we apply type conversion.
Corollary 3.12 Let H be a computable complex Hilbert space. Then the mapping
Φ˜ :⊆ B(H) → C(C(R), B(H)), T '→ Φ˜T

with and
 

dom(Φ˜) := {T ∈ B(H) | T is self-adjoint}

Φ˜T : C(R) → B(H), f '→ ΦT (f ♩σ(T ))


The Spectrum and Eigenvalues of Self-Adjoint Oper- ators
In this section we present our main result, which is a uniform version of the first two items of the Second Main Theorem of Pour-El and Richards [9]. We also prove corollaries of this result. The proof of the main result is suspended to the following sections because we need some technical preparations for it.
In the following by En we denote the enumeration representation of 2N, the set of all subsets of N.
Theorem 4.1 Let H be a computable complex Hilbert space. Then there exists a
δB(H), δN, En -computable multi-valued mapping

with domain such that
H :⊆ B(H) ⇒ RN × 2N

dom(H) := {T ∈ B(H) | T is self-adjoint}



{λn | n ∈ N} = σ(T ) and
σp(T )= {λn | n ∈ N \ A}
for all ((λn)n∈N, A) ∈ H(T ).
In the proof we use some further properties of the operational calculus, which we briefly state here. By χA we denote the characteristic function of a set A ⊆ R,
i.e. χA(x)= 1 if x ∈ A, and χA(x)=0 if x ∈/ A.

4 Here again we have to use a multi-valued function, namely the mapping of T to some upper bound of T , during the computation of the single-valued function ΦC(R). This is possible as the result of Φ(T, f ) only depends on T and the values of f on σ(T ), but not on the particular domain dom(f ), which only has to be a superset of σ(T ).

Proposition 4.2 Let H be a complex Hilbert space and T ∈ B(H) be self-adjoint.
λ ∈ ρ(T ), iff there exists an open interval U containing λ such that ΦT (χU )= 0.
λ ∈ σp(T ), iff ΦT (χ{λ}) /= 0. In this case ΦT (χ{λ}) is the projection on the eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue λ.
Using these properties in Section 6 we construct an algorithm that starts with “possible” eigenvectors 5 and tries to find the corresponding eigenvalues.
As a corollary we obtain the result that given a self-adjoint operator we can compute its spectrum as a compact set. By K(F) we denote the set of all compact subsets of F, and equip it with the representation κ<, which represents a compact set by positive information about it and a bound of it (see [11] for further information).
Corollary 4.3 Let H be a computable complex Hilbert space. Then the spectrum map


with domain
σ :⊆ B(H) → K(F), T '→ σ(T )

dom(σ) := {T ∈ B(H) | T is self-adjoint}

is (δB(H), κ<)-computable.
Proof. Given T ∈ dom(σ) by Theorem 4.1 we can compute a dense sequence (λn)n∈N in the spectrum of T and some upper bound of T  [1,3]. These information are equivalent to the information encoded by the representation κ<.	 
We already proved this result in [4], even for normal operators and real Hilbert spaces. But the result there only gave us information about the spectrum. The result presented here shows that we also can get some information about the eigen- values of a self-adjoint operator in complex Hilbert spaces.
¿From the uniform results we can derive some non-uniform results, namely the first two points of the Second Main Theorem of Pour-El and Richards [9] and the fact that the spectrum of a computable self-adjoint operator in a computable complex Hilbert space is a recursively enumerable compact set.
Corollary 4.4 Let H be a computable complex Hilbert space. Let T ∈ B(H) be δB(H)-computable and self-adjoint. Then there exist a δN-computable sequence (λn)n∈N ∈ RN and an En-computable subset A ⊆ N such that

{λn | n ∈ N} = σ(T ) and
σp(T )= {λn | n ∈ N \ A}
Corollary 4.5 Let H be a computable complex Hilbert space. Let T ∈ B(H) be δB(H)-computable and self-adjoint. Then the spectrum σ(T ) is κ<-computable, thus a recursively enumerable compact subset of F. Furthermore, every eigenvalue λ of T is a computable real.

In the next sections we present some technical results that we need for the proof of Theorem 4.1. The proof itself is presented in Section 7.

Prerequisites for the Proof
In this section we briefly introduce some functions that we use in the proof instead of the non-continuous characteristic functions and prove some (computability) results about them in conjunction with the operational calculus.

The Triangle Functions
In functional analysis the operational calculus is used in conjunction with charac- teristic functions to describe the spectrum of self-adjoint and normal operators. In computable analysis we need continuous functions, for which we have representa- tions. Thus instead of characteristic functions, we will use some kind of triangle functions as a continuous substitute. Pour-El and Richards already used this kind of functions in the proof of the Second Main Theorem [9]. In contrast to their proof, we divide the intervals into three overlapping subintervals, and not into 15 subintervals like it is done in [9].
Definition 5.1 We define the following functions (see Figure 1).
τ : R → R, x '→ max{1 − |x|, 0}.
τqi : R → R,x '→ τ (2qx − i) for q ∈ N and i ∈ Z.
τ−1,M : R → R, x '→ max{min{M − |x|, 1}, 0} for M ∈ N \ {0}.

We can derive the following properties from Definition 5.1 (see also Figure 2). In particular, the functions τqi are overlapping in such a way that for each stage q and each point x ∈ R we can find a function τqi that is greater than 1 at x. Detailed
proofs of these properties can be found in [6].

In contrast to the characteristic functions of intervals and points, the trian- gle functions τqi are continuous and even computable. Furthermore the mapping (q, i) '→ τqi is computable.
Lemma 5.3 The mapping
T : N × Z → C(R, R), (q, i) '→ τqi
is ([νN, νZ] , [δR → δR])-computable.
Particularly, the functions τqi with q ∈ N and i ∈ Z are (δR, δR)-computable.

The functions τ−1,M with M ∈ N \ {0} and the mapping M '→ τ−1,M are also computable. But we do not need this fact in the following proofs.
The Norms of the Operational Calculus
In this section we prove some technical lemmas about the norms 6	ΦT (τqi♩σ(T ))x
and the mapping FN defined by
FN :⊆ B(H) × N × Q ×H → R, (T, q, i, x) '→ ¨ΦT (τqi♩σ(T ))x¨

and

dom(FN) := {T ∈ B(H) | T is self-adjoint}× N × Z × SH .

Here by SX we denote the unit sphere SX := S(0, 1) := {x ∈ X | x  = 1} of a normed space X. The above mentioned norms and the mapping FN become important in the proof of the main result of this paper.
Lemma 5.4 Let H be a complex Hilbert space and T ∈ B(H) be a self-adjoint operator in H.
Let M ∈ N such that T  +1 ≤ M and let x ∈ SH. Then

max ¨ΦT

Let q ∈ N, i ∈ Z and x ∈ SH. Then

Proof. The above estimations can be derived from the (in)equalities given in Lemma 5.2 and the properties of the continuous functional calculus.
The function τ−1,M is the sum of 2M − 1 functions τ0i (Lemma 5.2), and the restriction to the domain σ(T ) is equal to the restriction of the function with constant value 1 to this domain. Therefore applying the properties of the operational calculus we obtain for x ∈ SH

Using the fact that the function τqi of stage q are a combination of three such function of stage q + 1 and the properties of the operational calculus we obtain for q ∈ N, i ∈ Z and x ∈ SH
¨ΦT (τqi♩σ(T ))x¨

¨ 2	 ¨	¨	2	}	¨

Now we obtain that given a self-adjoint operator T ∈ B(H), M ∈ N such that T  +1 ≤ M and x ∈ SH there exists a sequence (iq)q∈N in Z with the following properties:
The support of τq+1,iq+1 is a subset of the support of τq,iq .
The sequence (2−qiq)q∈N is a rapidly converging sequence in R. 7
It holds ¨Φ (τ	♩	)x¨ ≥	·	. That is for each q the norm is greater
than zero, but the difference between the norm and zero depends on q.
The limit λ of such a sequence (2−qiq)q∈N is an element of the spectrum of T . If λ is an eigenvalue of T then the difference between zero and the norm is independent of q, if additionally the distance between x and the eigenspace corresponding to λ is small enough.
Lemma 5.5 Let H be a complex Hilbert space and T ∈ B(H) be a self-adjoint oper- ator on H. Let z ∈ SH be a normalized eigenvector corresponding to an eigenvalue λ of T .
Let M ∈ N such that T  ≤ M and x ∈ SH. Then there exists some integer
i ∈ [−M, M ] such that

¨ΦT
(τ0i
♩σ(T )
)x¨ ≥ 2 − x − z  .

Let q ∈ N, i ∈ Z and x ∈ SH such that

¨ΦT
(τqi♩σ(T )
)x¨ ≥ 4 + x − z  .

Then there exists some j ∈ {2i − 1, 2i, 2i + 1} such that

¨ΦT
(τq+1,j
♩σ(T )
)x¨ ≥ 2 − x − z  .

Proof. As z is a normalized eigenvector of T we obtain
ΦT (τqi♩σ(T ))z  = |τqi(λ)| z  = τqi(λ) .
By Lemma 5.2 there exists some i ∈ Z such that −M ≤ i ≤ M and
¨ΦT (τ0i♩σ(T ))x¨ ≥ ¨ΦT (τ0i♩σ(T ))z¨ − x − z  = τ0i(λ) − x − z

If ¨ΦT (τqi♩σ(T ))x¨ ≥ 1 + x − z  then it holds

By Lemma 5.2 there exists some j ∈ {2i − 1, 2i, 2i + 1} such that
¨ΦT (τq+1,j♩σ(T ))x¨ ≥ ¨ΦT (τq+1,j♩σ(T ))z¨ − x − z  = τq+1,j(λ) − x − z

7 The elements 2−qiq are the centers of the support intervals of the functions τqiq . The intervals are nested and their length converges rapidly to 0. Therefore (2−qiq)q∈N converges.

 
Beside these pure mathematical properties of the norms	ΦT (τqi♩σ(T ))x	the mapping FN is computable.
Lemma 5.6 Let H be a computable complex Hilbert space. Then the mapping
FN :⊆ B(H) × N × Q ×H → R, (T, q, i, x) '→ ¨ΦT (τqi♩σ(T ))x¨

with

dom(FN) := {T ∈ B(H) | T is self-adjoint}× N × Z × SH

is  δB(H), νN, νZ, δH , δR -computable.
Proof. Since the mappings T : (q, i) '→ τqi and ΦC(R) : (T, f ) '→ ΦT (f ♩σ(T )) are computable, the composition (T, q, i) '→ ΦT (τqi♩σ(T )) is δB(H), νN, νZ , δB(H) - computable. Along with the computability of the norm we obtain the computability of the mapping FN.	 

The Technical Part of the Proof
In this section most of the technical part of the proof is done. We define two “technical” mappings, and prove their computability and some properties regarding the spectrum of a self-adjoint operator.

The mapping F
In this section we prove the computability of a mapping F that maps a tuple (T, M, a, x) on a sequence (iq)q∈N. Here T is a self-adjoint operator, M is an upper bound of the norm of T , a is an upper bound of an error and x is a vector with norm 1. (iq)q∈N is a sequence of integers that converges 8 to a real. This sequence meets some particular properties regarding the spectrum of T and the vector x. The properties also depend on the parameters M and a. In the next section we study a similar function that no longer depends on M and a.
Given a sequence (iq)q∈N ∈ ZN we define the intervals Iq, q ∈ N, by
Iq := 2−q(iq − 1), 2−q (iq + 1) .
Lemma 6.1 Let H be a computable complex Hilbert space. Then there exists a
δB(H), νN, νQ, δH , νN -computable multi-valued mapping


with
F :⊆ B(H) × N × Q ×H ⇒ ZN

dom(F) := {(T, M, a, x) ∈ B(H) × N × Q ×H | T is self-adjoint,
T  +1 ≤ M, 0 < a ≤ 1 and  x  = 1}



8 We explain later what is meant by converges in this context.

such that given (T, M, a, x) ∈ dom(F) for each sequence (iq)q∈N ∈ F(T, M, a, x) the following properties are fulﬁlled:
(2−qiq)q∈N is a rapidly converging Cauchy sequence in R.
I0 ⊆ [−M, M ] and ∀q ∈ N : Iq+1 ⊆ Iq.
∀q ∈ N : ¨Φ (τ	♩	)x¨ ≥	·	.
For q =0 it holds
ΦT (τ0i0 ♩σ(T ))x  > max	ΦT (τ0i♩σ(T ))x | −M +1 ≤ i ≤ M − 1 − a, 
and for all q ∈ N it holds
ΦT (τq+1,i	♩σ(T ))x
> max	ΦT (τq+1,j♩σ(T ))x  | j ∈ {2iq − 1, 2iq , 2iq + 1}  − a. 
Proof. The proof is a slight modification of the proof of the Second Main Theorem of Pour-El and Richards [9]. Using the computable version of the operational cal- culus the computation in [9] can be done in a way that is uniform in the operator
T . Since we divide the interval in three overlapping subintervals (and not in 15 subintervals) we have to use different error bounds than in [9].
In the following we describe a machine M0 that computes a sequence (iq)q∈N from a self-adjoint operator T , an upper bound M of its norm, an upper bound a of an error and a vector x. Then we prove that the sequence computed by M0 has the desired properties.
Given a tuple (T, M, a, x) ∈ dom(F) the machine M0 works in stages q = 0, 1, 2,.. ..  In stage q = 0 M0 computes 2M − 1 values r0i := FN(T, 0, i, x) =
¨ΦT (τ0i♩σ(T ))x¨ for i = −M + 1,... ,M − 1 and determines an index i0 of an
the difference between the approximate maximum r0i0 and the exact maximum
max{r0i  | i = −M + 1,... ,M − 1} is less than the error bound:  It holds

r0i
≥ max{r0i | i = −M + 1,... ,M − 1}−   1  ·  1  · a. Then M0 continues

with stage 1.
2M −1	2M

In stage q ≥ 1 M0 computes three values rqi := FN(T, q, i, x)=  ΦT (τqi♩σ(T ))x
for i = 2iq−1 − 1, 2iq−1, 2iq−1 + 1 and determines an index iq of an approximate
maximum r	with an error bound of 1 ·  1  ·  1 · a. Then M  continues with stage

q + 1.

The result of M0 is the sequence (iq)q∈N of the indices of the approximate max- ima. The sequence has the following properties.
For each q ∈ N we obtain |2−qiq − 2−(q+1)iq+1| = 2−(q+1)|2iq − iq+1|≤ 2−(q+1). Thus (2−qiq)q∈N is a rapidly converging sequence in R.
For q ∈ N we obtain
y ∈ Iq+1 ⇐⇒ 2−(q+1)(iq+1 − 1) ≤ y ≤ 2−(q+1)(iq+1 + 1)
=⇒ 2−q(iq − 1) ≤ y ≤ 2−q(iq + 1)
⇐⇒ y ∈ Iq
and because of length(Iq)= 2−q > 2−(q+1) = length(Iq+1) it follows Iq+1 Ç Iq.

Additionally we obtain I0 = [i0 − 1, i0 + 1] ⊆ [−M, M ].

The limit of rapidly converging sequences of reals is computable. More precisely, the function Lim :⊆ RN → R, (rn)n∈N '→ limn→∞ rn with dom(Lim) := {(rn)n∈N ∈ RN | |ri − rk| < 2−i for all i < k} is δN, δR -computable. Hence, we can compute the real number that is the limit of the sequence (2−qiq)q∈N corresponding to the sequence (iq)q∈N that we have computed in the proof of the Lemma above. We define a mapping
G :⊆ ZN → R, (iq)q∈N '→ lim 2−qiq = Lim((2−qiq)q∈N)
q→∞

with domain
dom(G) :=  (iq)q∈N ∈ ZN | (2−qiq)q∈N ∈ dom(Lim), .

Because of F(T, M, a, x) ⊆ dom(G) under the assumption (T, M, a, x) ∈ dom(F), we obtain dom(F) = dom(G ◦ F). In the following paragraphs we prove some properties

of the elements of G ◦ F(T, M, a, x) regarding the spectrum of T .

Subset of the Spectrum
For each (T, M, a, x) ∈ dom(F) the set G ◦ F(T, M, a, x) is a subset of σ(T ).
Lemma 6.2 Let H be a computable complex Hilbert space and F be deﬁned as in Lemma 6.1. Let (T, M, a, x) ∈ dom(F) = dom(G ◦ F). Then
lim 2−qiq ∈ σ(T )
q→∞
holds for all (iq)q∈N ∈ F(T, M, a, x), hence
λ ∈ G ◦ F(T, M, a, x) =⇒ λ ∈ σ(T )
and G ◦ F(T, M, a, x) ⊆ σ(T ).
Proof. Since (2−qiq)q∈N is a rapidly converging Cauchy sequence, its limit λ := limq→∞ 2−qiq is well defined. By Lemma 6.1 we obtain

¨Φ (τ	♩
 1    1
)x  ≥	·

for all q ∈ N. Hence τqiq ♩σ(T ) /= 0♩σ(T ) and support(τqiq ) ∩ σ(T ) /= ∅ for all q ∈
N. Because of support(τqiq ) = Iq it follows Iq ∩ σ(T ) /= ∅ for all q ∈ N. Thus for each q ∈ N there exists an element μq ∈ Iq in the spectrum σ(T ) such that
|μq − 2−qiq|≤ 2−q. As the intervals Iq are nested and their length converges rapidly to 0, the sequences (iq)q∈N and (μq)q∈N converge to the same limit λ. This limit is an element of σ(T ) because it is the limit of elements of the spectrum and the spectrum is closed. Therefore all elements of G ◦ F(T, M, a, x) are elements of σ(T ) if (T, M, a, x) ∈ dom(F).	 

Dense in the Spectrum
If we compute F(T, M, a, x) for fixed T , M and a with  T  +1 ≤ M and 0 < a ≤ 1 and for all x ∈ A where A is a dense subset of the unit sphere SH, then we obtain a dense subset of the spectrum. It even suffices to pick one sequence (iq)i∈N ∈ F(T, M, a, x) for each x ∈ A.
Lemma 6.3 Let H be a computable complex Hilbert space and F be deﬁned as in Lemma 6.1. Let T ∈ B(H) be self-adjoint, M ∈ N such that  T  +1 ≤ M and a ∈ Q such that 0 < a ≤ 1. Let A ⊆ SX be dense in SH and λ ∈ σ(T ). Then
∀ε > 0 ∃x ∈ A ∀(iq)q∈N ∈ F(T, M, a, x): λ − lim 2−qiq  < ε ,
q→∞
or equivalent
∀ε > 0 ∃x ∈ A ∀μ ∈ G ◦ F(T, M, a, x): |λ − μ| < ε .
Proof. We have to prove that given a self-adjoint operator T ∈ B(H), an “upper bound” M ≥  T  + 1 of its norm, an error bound a ∈ Q with 0 < a ≤ 1 and an element λ ∈ σ(T ) of the spectrum there exists a unit vector x ∈ SH such that all elements μ ∈ G ◦ F(T, M, a, x) are “sufficiently near” to λ.

Since σ(T ) ⊆ R for self-adjoint T , it holds λ ∈ R. Given ε > 0 we choose q0 ∈ N
such that 2−q0 < ε . Since λ ∈ σ(T ) we obtain ΦT (χ(λ− ε ,λ+ ε )) /= 0 so that the

subspace
4	2	2

Hλ, ε := range(ΦT (χ(λ− ε ,λ+ ε )))

2	2	2
is not the trivial subspace {0}. Thus there exists a vector z ∈ Hλ, ε ∩ SH and a

corresponding x ∈ A such that
1
x − z <
2M

1
4q0 .

We obtain	ΦT (τq0iq0 ♩σ(T ))x	> 0, hence ΦT (τq0iq0 ♩σ(T )) /= 0 for all sequences (iq)q∈N ∈ F(T, M, a, x). It follows τq0iq0 ♩σ(T ) · χ(λ− ε ,λ+ ε )) /= 0. Therefore, there

exists some μ ∈ (λ − ε ,λ + ε ) such that τ	♩	/
|μ − λ| < ε
and

2	2	q0iq0
σ(T )(μ) = 0, hence	2

|μ − 2−q0 iq | < 2−q0 . It follows
 λ − lim 2−qiq ≤ |λ − μ| + μ − 2−q0 iq0 + 2−q0 iq0 − lim 2−qiq < ε .


The Continuous Spectrum
For each sequence (iq)q∈N ∈ F(T, M, a, x) such that G((iq)q∈N) is an element of the continuous spectrum of T the norms ΦT (τqiq ♩σ(T ))x  fall below any bound. We use this property to identify the continuous spectrum within the spectrum.
Lemma 6.4 Let H be a computable complex Hilbert space and F be deﬁned as in Lemma 6.1. Let T ∈ B(H) be self-adjoint, M ∈ N such that T  +1 ≤ M, a ∈ Q such that 0 < a ≤ 1, and x ∈ SH. Then
lim 2−qiq ∈ σc(T ) =⇒  ∀ε > 0 ∃q0 ∈ N ∀q > q0 : ¨ΦT (τqi ♩σ(T ))x¨ < ε 

G((iq)q∈N) ∈ σc(T ) =⇒ lim	ΦT (τqi ♩σ(T ))x  =0 
q→∞
for every sequence (iq)q∈N ∈ F(T, M, a, x).
Proof. Let λ := limq→∞ 2−qiq. The sequence (τqi · (1 − χ{λ}))q∈N converges point- wise to zero and is uniformly bounded. Therefore limq→∞ ΦT (τqi·(1−χ{λ} )♩σ(T ))z = 0 for each z ∈ H. If λ ∈/ σp(T ) then ΦT (χ{λ}♩σ(T )) = 0. It follows
ΦT (τqi · (1 − χ{λ})♩σ(T ))= ΦT (τqi♩σ(T ))
and furthermore
lim ΦT (τqi♩σ(T ))x = lim ΦT (τqi · (1 − χ{λ})♩σ(T ))x = 0 .
q→∞	q→∞
Since T is self-adjoint, thus normal, σc(T ) = σ(T ) \ σp(T ) holds. Therefore λ ∈/ σp(T ) is equivalent to λ ∈ σc(T ) because of λ ∈ σ(T ). Hence
lim	ΦT (τqi♩σ(T ))x  =0 
q→∞
and the desired result follows.	 

The Point Spectrum (Eigenvalues)
Given a self-adjoint operator T ∈ B(H), an upper bound M ≥ T  + 1, and an error bound a ∈ Q such that 0 < a ≤ 1, the set of all values G ◦ F(T, M, a, x) forms a dense subset of σ(T ) if x varies over some dense subset A ⊆ SH. This set even
contains all eigenvalues of T if a < 1 . Furthermore in the case that G((iq)q∈N) is

an eigenvalue of T the norms ¨ΦT
4
(τqiq
♩σ(T )
)x¨ stay above 1 for each q ∈ N, if x is

“sufficiently near” to the corresponding eigenspace.
Lemma 6.5 Let H be a computable complex Hilbert space and F be deﬁned as in Lemma 6.1. Let T ∈ B(H) be self-adjoint and M ∈ N such that T  +1 ≤ M. Let

λ ∈ σp(T ) and z ∈ SH such that Tz = λz. Let a ∈ Q such that 0 < a < 1
and

x ∈ SH such that  x − z  ≤ 1 − 1 · a. Then limq→∞ 2−qiq = λ for all (iq)q∈N ∈
8	2
F(T, M, a, x) or equivalent G ◦ F(T, M, a, x)= {λ}. Furthermore

∀q ∈ N : ¨Φ (τ	♩

)x  >	− ( x − z + a) ≥	−	· a > 

for all (iq)q∈N ∈ F(T, M, a, x).
Proof. Due to Lemma 5.5 and 6.1 it holds that given T , M , λ and z as above and
a ∈ Q such that 0 < a ≤ 1 and x ∈ SH we obtain


as well as

holds, and therefore λ ∈ support(τqi ) for all q ∈ N. It follows limq→∞ 2−qiq = λ. 
If we compute the values G ◦ F(T, M, a, x) for all x ∈ A where A ⊆ SH is some dense subset of the unit sphere of H, then for each eigenvalue λ of T we also compute this values for some vector x that is “sufficiently near” to the corresponding

eigenspace. Therefore the whole point spectrum of T is “computed” during this procedure.
Corollary 6.6 Let H be a computable complex Hilbert space and F be deﬁned as in Lemma 6.1. Let A ⊆ SH be dense in SH and a ∈ Q such that 0 < a ≤ 1 . Let T ∈ B(H) be self-adjoint and M ∈ N such that T  +1 ≤ M. Let λ ∈ σp(T ) and z ∈ SH such that Tz = λz. Then there exists some x ∈ A such that limq→∞ 2−qiq = λ and
∀q ∈ N : ¨ΦT (τqi ♩σ(T ))x¨ ≥ 3 − 1 · a > 1 for all (iq)q∈N ∈ F(T, M, a, x).
Proof. Since A is a dense subset of the unit sphere SH there exists some x ∈ A
such that x − z  ≤ 1 − 1 · a. Now we apply Lemma 6.5.	 
8	2
The mapping Ha
In this section we define a mapping Ha that is similar to F but only with the self- adjoint operator T and the unit vector x as input. More precisely Ha is based on F in such a way that the upper bound M of T is computed from T and the error bound a is fixed for Ha. The additional parameters of F compared to Ha have been necessary to describe the properties of F (and G ◦ F) properly.
Lemma 6.7 Let H be a computable complex Hilbert space. Given a ∈ Q such that

with
Z
Ha :⊆ B(H) ×H ⇒ ZN

dom(Ha) := {T ∈ B(H) | T is self-adjoint}× SH

such that range(Ha) ⊆ dom(G) and the following properties are fulﬁlled for each
T ∈ B(H) and A ⊆ SH.
It holds that


or equivalent
G ◦ Ha[{T }× SH] ⊆ σ(T )

∀(T, x) ∈ dom(Ha):  λ ∈ G ◦ Ha(T, x) =⇒ λ ∈ σ(T ) .

In particular given x ∈ A all elements of G ◦ Ha(T, x) are elements of the spectrum of T .
If A is dense in SH then
∀λ ∈ σ(T ) ∀ε > 0 ∃x ∈ A ∀μ ∈ G ◦ Ha(T, x): |λ − μ| < ε .
If ha is some choice function of Ha and A is dense in SH, then G ◦ ha[{T }× A]
is dense in σ(T ).
It holds that
∀x ∈ SH ∀(iq)q∈N ∈ Ha(T, x) :
 G((iq)q∈N) ∈ σc(T ) =⇒ lim ¨ΦT (τqiq ♩σ(T ))x¨ =0 
or equivalent

∀ε > 0 ∀x ∈ SH ∀(iq)q∈N ∈ Ha(T, x) :
G((iq)q∈N) ∈ σc(T ) =⇒	∃q0 ∈ N ∀q > q0 :	ΦT (τqiq ♩σ(T ))x  < ε	.
Given x ∈ A the norms of the operational calculus of any result of Ha(T, x)
become arbitrarily small, in particular smaller than 1 , if the image under G is
in the continuous spectrum.
If A is dense in SH, it holds that
∀λ ∈ σp(T ) ∃x ∈ A :
 G ◦ Ha(T, x)= {λ} and  ∀(iq)q ∈ N ∈ Ha(T, x)∀q ∈ N :

¨Φ (τ	♩
3	1	1
)x  ≥  −  ·	

If ha is some choice function of Ha and A is dense in SH then σp(T ) ⊆
G ◦ ha[{T }× A]. For each λ ∈ σp(T ) there even exists some x ∈ A such that
the norm of the operational calculus stays above 1 for all results of Ha(T, x)
and the image under G is λ for every element of Ha(T, x).
Proof. Let F be defined as in Lemma 6.1. Given some operator T ∈ B(H) we can compute an upper bound of  T  [1,3] and therefore also some M ∈ N such that M ≥ T  + 1. Now (T, M, a, x) ∈ dom(F) holds if 0 < a < 1 and (T, x) ∈ dom(Ha). Hence we can compute F(T, M, a, x) as the result of Ha(T, x). Using the properties of F we obtain the following properties for the results (iq)q∈N of Ha(T, x).
By Lemma 6.2 G((iq)q∈N) ∈ σ(T ) holds.
Let λ ∈ σ(T ) and A be a dense subset of SH. By Lemma 6.3 for each ε > 0 there exists some x ∈ A such that |λ − G((iq)q∈N)| < ε if (iq)q∈N is computed using this particular x.
If G((iq)q∈N) ∈ σc(T ), then by Lemma 6.4 limq→∞  ΦT (τqiq ♩σ(T ))x  =0 holds.
Let λ ∈ σp(T ) and A be a dense subset of SH. Let z ∈ SH such that Tz = λz. Then by Corollary 6.6 there exists some x ∈ A such that G((iq)q∈N)= λ and
∀q ∈ N : ¨ΦT (τqi ♩σ(T ))x¨ ≥ 3 − 1 · a > 1 if (iq)q∈N is computed using this
Hence the claimed properties of Ha hold.	 
The computable mapping Ha, 0 < a < 1 , provides an opportunity to compute the spectrum and the eigenvalues of self-adjoint operators T ∈ B(H) using the “program”, thus a δB(H)-name of T , in a uniform way.
Given some operator T and a vector x we can compute a sequence (iq)q∈N ∈
Ha(T, x) and furthermore a real number λ = G((iq )q∈N.
If we compute a sequence in (G ◦ Ha(T, xn))n∈N using a sequence (xn)n∈N that is dense in SH and pick one real number out of Ha(T, xn) for each n ∈ N, then we obtain a dense sequence in the spectrum σ(T ) that contains all eigenvalues of T .
For the elements (iq)q∈N ∈ Ha(T, x) of the sequence (G ◦ Ha(T, xn))n∈N we can determine if G((iq)q∈N) is an eigenvalue or not by having a look at the norms


	
xn is “sufficiently near” to the corresponding eigenspace. In the other case the norm tends to zero, hence it becomes smaller than 1 at some stage.
The Proof: Computability of the Spectrum and the Eigenvalues
Now we are prepared to prove the main result of this paper. The sequence (iq)q∈N computed by Ha corresponds to the sequence that Pour-El and Richards compute in the proof of the Second Main Theorem [9] for a single vector x. In this section we define a mapping based on Ha that applies the mapping Ha to a sequence (xn)n∈N of unit vectors such that we obtain a sequence (λn)n∈N in the spectrum σ(T ) and a set A ⊆ N that contains the indices of the “non-eigenvalues” 9 . Hence given some self-adjoint operator T this mapping computes a sequence and a set, corresponding to the sequence and the set of part (i) and (ii) of the Second Main Theorem [9].
First we recall the main result stated in Section 4. Then we prove it.
Theorem 7.1 Let H be a computable complex Hilbert space. Then there exists a
δB(H), δN, En -computable multi-valued mapping

with domain such that
H :⊆ B(H) ⇒ RN × 2N

dom(H) := {T ∈ B(H) | T is self-adjoint}



{λn | n ∈ N} = σ(T ) and
σp(T )= {λn | n ∈ N \ A}
for all ((λn)n∈N, A) ∈ H(T ).
Proof. The unit sphere SH is a recursive closed 10 subset of H as it has the com- putable distance function distSH (x) = |x  − 1| [5, Corollary 3.14]. Hence there exists a δN -computable sequence (xn)n∈N that is dense in SH [5, Corollary 3.14]. We fix such a sequence for the following procedure and choose a := 1 .  Using

the computability of Ha = H 1
8
and (xn)n∈N we can compute a double sequence

((in)q∈N)n∈N ∈ (Ha(T, xn))n∈N that has the properties described in the preceding sections.
Using this sequence we can compute a sequence (λn)n∈N = (G((in)q∈N))n∈N such that λn = G((in)q∈N) for n ∈ N. Furthermore we can compute the sequence

 ¨ΦT (τqin ♩σ(T ))xn¨ 

q∈N
for each n ∈ N and scan it whether at some stage the

value becomes less than 1 . If this is the case we “add” n to the sequence that represents the set A. 11 As proved before all n such that λn is an eigenvalue and

9 We explain later what exactly is meant by “non-eigenvalues”.
10 Closed and compact subsets of computable metric spaces are studied e.g. in [5].
11 We can determine whether this is the case. But we cannot determine the other case.

xn is “sufficiently near” to the eigenspace corresponding to λn are never listed in

this sequence because for these n the norms are greater than 1
at any stage. As

for every eigenvalue λ of T there exists some vector xn that is near enough to the corresponding eigenspace the set N \ A contains at least one n such that λn = λ. 
A more detailed proof can be found in [6].

Conclusions
In this paper we have studied the computability of the spectrum of self-adjoint op- erators in complex Hilbert spaces using the framework of TTE. We have proved a uniform version of the Second Main Theorem of Pour-El and Richards [9]. Roughly speaking, we have shown that the spectrum map of self-adjoint operators on com- putable complex Hilbert spaces is lower-semicomputable, and that we can identify the continuous spectrum within the spectrum in such a way that the remaining elements of a dense sequence in the spectrum form the set of eigenvalues of a given self-adjoint operator.
Additionally we have stated a computable version of the operational calculus, which we used in the proofs regarding the spectrum.
There remain several interesting questions regarding the computability of the spectrum of linear operators. In [9] Pour-El and Richards also gave a version of the Second Main Theorem for bounded normal operators and for unbounded closed self-adjoint operators. In [4] we stated our results not only for normal operators on complex Hilbert spaces, but also for self-adjoint operators on real Hilbert spaces as well as normal operators on complex Hilbert spaces. It is still an open question whether a uniform version of the results of Pour-El and Richards regarding normal and unbounded operators can be proved, i.e. if it is possible to obtain information about the eigenvalues from a program of the operator in these cases.
More detailed proofs of most of the results presented here can be found in [6].
