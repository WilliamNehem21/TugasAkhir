A version of the integrable problem of motion of a dynamically symmetric gyrostat about a fixed point similar to the Kowalevski top, while acted upon by a combination of uniform gravity and magnetic fields is considered. This version is reduced, in general, to hyper- elliptic quadratures. The special case when the gyrostatic momentum is absent is solved in terms of elliptic functions of time.

Introduction

The problem of motion of a heavy rigid body about a fixed point has a long history beginning with Euler's work [1]. For most of this history, the main concern of authors was to isolate cases, when the general solution of the equations of motion can be expressed explicitly in terms of functions of time, or, at least, can be reduced to quadratures. This recipe has succeeded in two cases: Euler's case of a body moving by inertia and Lagrange's case of a symmetrical top [2].
Separation of variables in Euler's case was found by Euler himself, but the solution was expressed by Jacobi in terms of his newly invented elliptic functions. Lagrange reduced the case of axisymmetric top to separation of variables involving elliptic integrals. Explicit expression of the solution in terms of time was initiated by Jacobi and can be found with some variations in [3e5].
The following historical turn in rigid body dynamics came in the opposite direction, from the study of the nature of so- lutions of the equations of motion. Kowalevski [6] isolated the possible cases which share with Euler's and Lagrange's cases

the property of having their solutions as meromorphic func- tions of time. It turned out that only one more case satisfies this criterion. That case became known as Kowalevski's.
Kowalevski obtained the complementary integral for that case
as a quartic polynomial in velocities. She also integrated the equations of motion in terms of hyperelliptic functions of time. Her solution was simplified by Ko€tter [7] and reconsid- ered by a series of authors. For a detailed history, see e.g. [8]. When a uniformly rotating rotor has its axis of symmetry fixed in the rigid body, the resulting system is known as a gyrostat. For this system, the generalization of Lagrange's case and its solution was straightforward. Euler's case was gener-
alized by Zhukovsky [9]. The corresponding solution was shown by Volterra to be expressible in terms of sigma func- tions of Weierstrass [10]. In [11], Wittenburg pointed out another solution in terms of elliptic functions of time. Detailed presentation of the history of general and particular solutions for a heavy gyrostat can be found in [12].
A century after the discovery of Kowalevski's case, its
generalization to the problem of gyrostat has been found in a different context. The problem of motion of a gyrostat similar to the Kowalevski top and acted upon by two skew uniform fields (gravity and magnetic) was considered in [13]. A general first integral quartic in velocities and generalizing the Kowa- levski integral was found for this generic problem. As, in the
general case, the two force fields problem does not admit a


results for separated systems [23] give a method to calculate the exact topological invariants of singular points and all regular iso-energy levels. This will give the complete topo- logical analysis of the problem which will be different (as far as special types of motions are concerned) from the corre- sponding Goryachev and Chaplygin cases [17,24] since the analogy of these problems with the motion of a gyrostat in two fields does not give a global diffeomorphism of the corre- sponding phase spaces.
It will also be interesting to analyze all special cases when the trajectories in reduced systems become periodic. For the Goryachev case the corresponding quadratures are found in [17]. In our problem such quadratures can lead to explicit calculation of the orientation matrix and therefore provide the analytical basis for the geometric interpretation of periodic and two-frequency motions of the considered gyrostat in two fields.


Equations and integrals

The equation of the motion of a gyrostat acted upon by two homogeneous fields in the general case can be written in the Euler e Poisson form

symmetry group, the additional cyclic integral does not exist. It turned out that such integral still exists in two special cases
M_ = M × u + c1 × a + c2 × b;
a_ = a × u; b_ = b × u.
(1)

[13]. The first case generalizes Kowalevski's case of one field to
the gyrostat motion in one field. The second case does not contain the classical case of Kowalevski, since the intensities of the two fields are proportional and can vanish only simul- taneously. In the last case the cyclic variable is a comple- mentary angle to the sum (or difference) of the two angles of precession and proper rotation.
In the present paper we accomplish separation of variables for a version of the last case, corresponding to a special value of the cyclic constant proportional to the gyrostatic moment and singled out by the condition that the reduced system becomes time-reversible. We give two algebraic separations of variables. In the first one, the cyclic constant is supposed non- zero and the variables of separation are to be determined as functions of time by solving hyperelliptic AbeleJacobi equa- tions. This result is based on the analogy established in [14] (see also [15] for further generalizations) of a special class of problems of the gyrostat motion in two fields with the prob- lems of the gyrostat motion in axially symmetric field with zero momentum constant. Thus, the first separation given below corresponds to the algebraic separation [16,17] found by the method proposed in [18,19] for the Goryachev case. This separation is not applicable if the gyrostatic moment in the initial problem is zero. Nevertheless, as it is shown in [14], the equivalent problem of the rigid body motion in an axisym- metric field is the integrable case of Chaplygin [20]. Therefore we give the second separation which transfers the elliptic separation found by Chaplygin to the two-fields problem.
The two types of separation of variables accomplished here make it easy to apply the algorithm of finding the admissible regions for the integral constants and to establish the rough phase topology of the system [21,22]. Moreover, the recent
Here u is the angular velocity, a and b are the characteristic
vectors of the force fields (say, the vectors of the gravity force and of the magnetic field strength), c1; c2 are the vectors pointing from the fixed point O to the centers of the fields application. All objects are referred to some moving axes. The
kinetic momentum vector M is connected with the angular velocity by the relation
M = uI + l;
where I and l are the inertia tensor at O and the gyrostatic momentum vector. Both I and l are constant in the moving frame. We consider the components of all vectors as rows, thus obtaining the unusual order of the objects in the above expression for M.
It is known [8] that without changing the plane Oc1c2 in the body, one can make the pair of the vectors c1; c2 to be ortho- normal. Let us choose the moving frame Oe1e2e3 of the prin- cipal axes of the inertia tensor. Suppose that the gyrostat is dynamically symmetric e1I•e1 = e2I•e2, l = {0; 0; l} and the centers of the fields application lie in the equatorial plane c1•e3 = 0, c2•e3 = 0. In this case (see [25,26]) by some linear change of variables one can make the immovable in space vectors a; b to be mutually orthogonal. Then, after the pair
c1; c2 is made orthonormal, the modules of the vectors a; b
contain all scalar information on the interaction of the gyro- stat with the fields (e.g. for the gravity field, the module of the corresponding vector is equal to the product of the gyrostat weight and the distance from the mass center to the fixed point). Therefore, we call a and b the intensities of the force fields. In the case of dynamic symmetry any orthonormal pair in the equatorial plane becomes principal for the inertia tensor, so we take e1 = c1, e2 = c2.

In what follows, we assume that the inertia tensor satisfies the Kowalevski conditions
I = diag{I1, I1, I3},  I1 = I2 = 2I3	(2)
and the intensities of the orthogonalized fields are equal

a2 = b2 = a2, a$b = 0 (a > 0).	(3) We also choose the dimension units in such a way that
I3 = 1.
Note that introducing dimensionless variables we can also obtain a = 1. Still, we keep the inessential parameter a for a possibility to pass to the limit case a = 0, and also for better control on the dimensions of expressions in the obtained formulas.
As shown in [13], under conditions (2), (3) in addition to the energy integral
H = u2 + u2 + 1	— a — b
therefore, G is, up to the constant multiplier a, the corre- sponding momentum integral.

Reduction by cyclic coordinate

We introduce the Euler angles q, 4, j (0⩽q⩽p, 0⩽4⩽2p, 0⩽j⩽2p), supposing q is the angle between g and e3:

a1 = a(cos4cosj — sin4sinjcosq), a2 = —a(sin4cosj + cos4sinjcosq), a3 = asinjsinq,
b1 = a(cos4sinj + sin4cosjcosq), b2 = —a(sin4sinj — cos4cosjcosq), b3 = —acosjsinq,
g1 = asin4sinq, g2 = acos4sinq, g3 = acosq,
u1 = j_ sin4sinq + qcos4, u2 = j_ cos4sinq — q_ sin4,
u3 = 4_ + j_ cosq.

G = 2u1g1 + 2u2g2 + (u3 + l)(g3 — a).
Here the vector g = a—1 a × b augments the pair a, b to form a fixed in space orthogonal basis normalized by the value a. In particular, the matrix of direction cosines is

Q = a @ b A.
Let us consider the action on SO(3) of the subgroup {gt} of matrices

This action is not free; the subgroup {gt} itself is a sta- tionary subgroup for each of its elements. Suppose that passing to the quotient space we identify the whole subgroup

q = p, i.e. to the case

sinq = 0.	(6)
We shall consider only those solutions of the system (1) which do not cross the set of the phase space satisfying (6).
We will now introduce a change of variables
4 = F — J, j = J,  q = 2Q.
Then Q2[0, p/2], and the angles F, J can be taken to vary on the segment [0, 2p], since the change (4, j)1(F, J) is given
by the integer matrix with determinant 1. Obviously, J is a cyclic coordinate corresponding to the integral G. In the new variables, this integral is

G = a  = 2a (3 + cos2Q)J_ — F_ — l sin2Q.
It is natural to denote its constant by 2ag. From the equa- tion of the cyclic integral we find
 F_ + l sin2Q + g




the two-dimensional sphere, but this bundle is not locally trivial [27,28]. Therefore, such symmetry is called a singular symmetry. The singular points on the quotient sphere obvi- ously correspond to the cases
g = ±ae3.	(5)
Here we denote

D = 3 + cos2Q = 2 2 — sin2Q .
Eliminating the cyclic coordinate we construct the Routhian

exists a separation of variables. One of the possible ways to obtain a separation was pointed out in [30]. Complete real algebraic separation for the Goryachev case was given in [16,17]. Here we give a real separation for the gyrostat in the double field with singular symmetry under condition (7).

Having chosen at this moment one of the possible solu- tions of system (32), we thus have determined the formal



The expression for J is obtained by integrating the relation
following expressions of the phase variables. The radicals
themselves can have any sign on a trajectory (moreover, some of them change the sign periodically) but the formal expres-

Whence, according to (30) and (31), we obtain the expres- sions (25) for the generalized velocities.
Substituting the values (24) and (25) in (20), we come to separated Equation (26). Let us emphasize that this separation is elliptic with polynomial of degree 3 in the radicals, therefore it is complete in the sense that both Equation (26) are inte- grated independently of each other. Of course, the solutions can be easily written out in Jacobi functions.
Finally, we find J_ from (9) by putting l = 0.
This completes the expressions for Q, Q_ , F, F_ , J_ as elliptic functions of time.
