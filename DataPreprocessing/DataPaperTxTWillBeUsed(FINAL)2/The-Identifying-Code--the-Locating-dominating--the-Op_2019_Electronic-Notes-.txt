Abstract
The problems of determining minimum identifying, locating-dominating, open locating-dominating or lo- cating total-dominating codes in a graph G are variations of the classical minimum dominating set problem in G and are all known to be hard for general graphs. A typical line of attack is therefore to determine the cardinality of minimum such codes in special graphs. In this work we study the change of minimum such codes under three operations in graphs: adding a universal vertex, taking the generalized corona of a graph, and taking the square of a graph. We apply these operations to paths and cycles which allows us to provide minimum codes in most of the resulting graph classes.
Keywords: identifying code, locating-dominating set, open locating-dominating set, locating total-dominating set

Introduction and preliminaries
Let G = (V, E) be a graph and V = {1,,..., n}. The open neighborhood of a vertex u is the set N (u) of all vertices of G adjacent to u, and N [u]= {u}∪ N (u) is the closed neighborhood of u. A subset C ⊆ V is dominating (resp. total-dominating ) if N [i] ∩ C (resp. N (i) ∩ C) are non-empty sets for all i ∈ V .
In this work we study four problems that have been actively studied during the last decade, see e.g. the bibliography maintained by Lobstein [16].
A subset C ⊆ V is:
an identifying code (ID) if it is a dominating set and N [i] ∩ C /= N [j] ∩ C, for
i, j ∈ V [15].
a locating-dominating set (LD) if it is a dominating set and N (i) ∩C /= N (j) ∩C, for i, j ∈ V − C [21].
an open locating-dominating set (OLD) if it is a total-dominating set and N (i) ∩
C /= N (j) ∩ C, for i, j ∈ V [20].
a locating total-dominating set (LTD) if it is a total-dominating set and N (i)∩C /=
N (j) ∩ C, for i, j ∈ V − C [11].
Note that not every graph admits an identifying code, in fact, a graph G admits an identifying code (or G is identiﬁable) if there are no true twins in G, i.e., there is no pair of distinct vertices i, j ∈ V such that N [i]= N [j], see [15]. Analogously, a graph G without isolated vertices admits a open locating-dominating set if there are no false twins in G, i.e., there is no pair of distinct vertices i, j ∈ V such that N (i)= N (j), see [20].
Given a graph G, for X ∈ {ID, LD, OLD, LTD}, the X-problem on G is the problem of finding an X-set of minimum size of G. The size of such a set is called the X-number of G and it is denoted by γX (G). From the definitions, the following relations hold for any graph G (admitting an X-set):
γLD(G) ≤ γLT D(G) ≤ γOLD(G),	(1)


and
γLD(G) ≤ γID(G).

Note that γID(G) and γOLD(G) are not comparable as the following examples show: Determining γID(G) is in general NP-hard [5] and even remains hard for several graph classes where other in general hard problems are easy to solve, including bipartite graphs [5] and two classes of chordal graphs, namely split graphs and interval graphs [8]. The identifying code problem has been actively studied during the last decade, where typical lines of attack are to determine minimum identifying

codes of special graphs or to provide bounds for their size. Closed formulas for the exact value of γID(G) have been found so far only for restricted graph families (e.g. for paths and cycles [4], for stars [9], for complete multipartite graphs [1] and some subclasses of split graphs [2]).
Also determining γLD(G) is in general NP-hard [5] and even remains hard for bipartite graphs [5]. This result is extended to planar bipartite unit disk graphs in [17]. Closed formulas for the exact value of γLD(G) have been found so far for restricted graph families as e.g. paths [21], cycles [4], stars, complete multipartite graphs and thin suns [3].
Determining γOLD(G) is in general NP-hard [20] and remains NP-hard for per- fect elimination bipartite graphs and APX-complete for chordal graphs with maxi- mum degree 4 [18]. Closed formulas for the exact value of γOLD(G) have been found so far only for restricted graph families such as cliques and paths [20].
Concerning the LTD-problem we observe that it is as hard as the OLD-problem by just using the same arguments as in [20]. Bounds for the LTD-number of trees are given in [11,12]. In addition, the LTD-number in special families of graphs, including cubic graphs and grid graphs, is investigated in [12].
To apply polyhedral methods, a reformulation as set covering problem is in order. For a 0/1-matrix M with n columns, the set covering polyhedron is Q∗(M )= 
conv  x ∈ Zn : Mx ≥ 1} and Q(M )=  x ∈ Rn : Mx ≥ 1} is its linear relaxation.
By [2] and [3] such constraint systems MXx ≥ 1 with X ∈ {ID, LD}, respectively,
are
⎛ N [G] ⎞	⎛ N [G] ⎞

M	(G)= 
Δ2[i, j]
M	(G)= 
Δ2[i, j]


where i, j ∈ V (G), every row in matrix N [G] (resp. N (G)) is the characteristic vector of a closed (resp. open) neighborhood of a vertex in G and Δk(i, j) (resp. Δk[i, j]) is the characteristic vector of a symmetric difference of open (resp. closed) neighborhoods of vertices at distance k. Using analogous arguments as in [2] and

[3], it is not hard to verify that, if X ∈ {OLD, LTD}, we have:
⎛ N (G) ⎞	⎛ N (G) ⎞

M	(G)= 
Δ2(i, j)
M	(G)= 
Δ2[i, j]

Observe that, when considering these problems as set covering problems, we can delete from MX (G) the redundant (duplicated or dominated) rows.
The work is organized as follows: in Section 2, given a graph G, we study the change of γX (G) with X ∈ {ID, LD, OLD, LTD} under the addition of a universal vertex to G. Then we apply these results to calculate γX (G) when G is a fan or a wheel. In Section 3 we use the polyhedral approach to find γX (G) when G is the generalized corona of a graph. Finally, in Section 4, we study the same numbers when G is the square of a path or cycle.
Graphs obtained from adding a universal vertex
Let G = (V, E) be a connected graph and 0 ∈/ V . We define the graph obtained by adding a universal vertex Gj = (V j, Ej) as the graph such that V j = V ∪ {0} and Ej = E ∪ {0i, i ∈ V }.
Remark 2.1 Let G = (V, E) be a graph and 0 ∈/ V .
Gj has true twins iff G has true twins or a universal vertex (i.e. a vertex i such that N [i]= V ).
Gj has false twins iff G also has.
Theorem 2.2 Let X ∈ {ID, LD, OLD, LTD} and G = (V, E) be a connected graph admitting an X-set. In particular, if X = ID we assume that G does not contain a universal vertex. Then, if G’ is the graph obtained by adding a universal vertex to G, it holds that
γX (G) ≤ γX (Gj) ≤ γX (G)+ 1.
Moreover, if there is a minimum X-set C such that for all i ∈ V , C ¢ N [i] when
X = ID or C ¢ N (i) when X ∈ {LD, OLD, LTD} then γX (Gj) = γX (G) and
γX (Gj)= γX (G)+1 otherwise.
Proof. Let Cj be an X-set of minimum size of Gj, i.e., γX (Gj)= |Cj|.
If 0 ∈/ Cj then Cj is an X-set of G and γX (G) ≤ |Cj| = γX (Gj). If 0 ∈ Cj, as 0 ∈ N [i] for all i ∈ V , 0 does not identify the vertices in V . On the other hand, as Cj is minimal, then there exists j ∈ V such that N [j] ∩ Cj = {0}. Moreover j is the only vertex with this property since Cj is an X-set of Gj. Since G is connected, there exists k ∈ N (j) ∩ V then we define C = Cj − {0}∪ {k}. It holds that C is an X-set of G such that |C| = |Cj|. Therefore, γX (G) ≤ |C| = |Cj| = γX (Gj).

Assume that if C is an X-set of minimum size of G, there is iC ∈ V such that C ⊆ N [iC]. Clearly C is not an X-set of Gj. But if X = ID then there is j ∈/ N [iC] and C ∪ {j} is an ID-set of Gj. If X ∈ {LD, OLD, LTD} then C ∪ {0} is an X-set of Gj. In any case γX (Gj) ≤ γX (G)+ 1.
Now, assume that there is an X-set C of minimum size of G such that for all i ∈ V , C ¢ N [i] when X = ID or C ¢ N (i) when X ∈ {LD, OLD, LTD}. We will prove that C is an X-set of Gj.
As N (0) ∩ C = C /= ∅ then C total-dominates or dominates the vertices in V j. On the other hand, we suppose that N [0]∩C = N [i]∩C (or N (0)∩C = N (i)∩C)
for some i ∈ V if C is an X-set with X = ID (or X ∈ {LD, OLD, LTD}) then C ⊆ N [i] ∩ C (resp. C ⊆ N (i) ∩ C) and this contradicts the assumption on C. Then, N [0] ∩ C /= N [i] ∩ C (N (0) ∩ C /= N (i) ∩ C ) for all i ∈ V , i.e., C is an X-set of Gj with X ∈ {ID, LD, OLD, LTD}. Therefore, γX (Gj) ≤ |C| = γX (G).
Finally, assume that for every minimum X-set C of G there exists i ∈ V such that C ⊆ N [i] if X = ID (C ⊆ N (i) if X ∈ {LD, OLD, LTD}). Let D be a minimum X-code of Gj such that |D| = γX (G). It is clear that 0 ∈ D. Hence there is a unique k ∈ V such that N [k]∩D = {0}. Let j ∈ N (k) and let Dj = D−{0}∪{j}. It is easy to check that Dj is an X-set of Gj of cardinality γX (G) not containing vertex 0. Hence Dj is an X-set of G of cardinality γX (G), then from assumption there exists h ∈ V such that Dj ⊆ N [h], but this contradicts the fact that Dj is an X-set of Gj since vertices 0 and h are not separated.	2
Let Fn (resp. Wn) denote the fan (resp. wheel ) of n + 1 vertices, i.e., Fn (resp. Wn) is the graph obtained by adding a universal vertex to the path Pn (resp. cycle Cn).
For X ∈ {ID, LD, OLD, LTD}, γX (Pn) has already been calculated, see the following table.

Table 1
γX (Pn)

Now, in the case of cycles, γID(Cn), γLD(Cn) and γLT D(Cn) are known. The value of γOLD(Cn) is provided in the following result.
Lemma 2.3 For n ≥ 3, γOLD(Cn)= [ 2n |.
Proof (Sketch) In [20] it is proved that γOLD(Cn) ≥ [ 2n |. The bound is tight as
we can show, if n = 3k + r with r = 0, 1, 2, the sets
{3i − 2, 3i − 1:1 ≤ i ≤ k} if r = 0,

{3i − 2, 3i − 1:1 ≤ i ≤ k}∪ {n − 1} if r = 1,
{3i − 2, 3i − 1:1 ≤ i ≤ k}∪ {n − 1,n − 2} if r = 2,
are OLD-sets of Cn of cardinality [ 2n |.	2
We summarize the results for cycles in the following table:

Table 2
γX (Cn)

For n ≥ 4 and X ∈ {ID, LD, OLD, LTD}, from Theorem 2.2 we have γX (Pn) ≤ γX (Fn) and γX (Cn) ≤ γX (Wn). If n = 4, X-sets of minimum size (the black vertices) are depicted in the figure below.



Fig. 2. Minimum X-sets for P4 and F4

For W4 and W5, X-sets of minimum size are shown in Fig. 3 and 4.



Fig. 3. Minimum X-sets for C4 and W4

As a consequence of Theorem 2.2, we obtain:
Corollary 2.4 For X ∈ {ID, LD, OLD, LTD} we have γX (Fn)= γX (Pn) if n ≥ 5
and γX (Wn)= γX (Cn) if n ≥ 6.
Proof. If n ≥ 5, at least one vertex in each of the sets {1, 2} and {n − 1, n} must belong to an X-set of Pn. Then, from Theorem 2.2, γX (Fn)= γX (Pn).


			


Fig. 4. Minimum X-sets for C5 and W5
Now, as n ≥ 6, it is immediate to observe that no minimum X-set is contained in N [i] (N (i)) when X ∈ {ID, LD} (when X ∈ {OLD, LTD}), then again from Theorem 2.2, γX (Wn)= γX (Cn).	2
Observe that by combining the results in Corollary 2.4 and Tables 1 and 2, we compute the exact value of a minimum X-set of a fan or a wheel for X ∈
{ID, LD, OLD, LTD}.
Generalized corona of a graph
Let G = (V, E) be a graph and k ∈ Z|V |. The k-corona of G, denoted by Gk is the graph obtained by adding ki pendant vertices to each i ∈ V .
As the pendant vertices are false twins if ki ≥ 2 for some i ∈ V , the graph Gk does not admit an OLD-set. But in the case ki =1 for all i ∈ V the only OLD-set of Gk is V . We now study the remaining problems.
Theorem 3.1 Let Gk be the k-corona of a graph G with k ∈ Z|V |, k = (k1, k2,...,k	),
+	|V |
ki ≥ 2 for all i ∈ {1, 2,..., |V |}.  Then, γID(Gk) = γLD(Gk) = γLT D(Gk) =
k1 + ··· + k|V |.
Proof. Let V = {v1,..., v|V |} and for each vi ∈ V , Pi = {p1,..., pki } the set of the
i	i
pendent vertices of vi with ki ≥ 3 for all i ∈ {1,..., |V |}.
Clearly, N [pj]= {pj, vi} and Δ2[pj, pk]= {pj, pk}. Hence, the rows correspond-
i	i	i	i	i	i
ing to the sets N [vi]= Pi ∪ {vi}∪ NG(vi), Δ1[vi, vj]= Pi ∪ Pj ∪ (NG(vi) ΔNG(vj)),
Δ1[vi, pj] = (Pi − {pj}) ∪ NG(vi), Δ2[vi, pk] = Pi ∪ (NG[vi] − {vj}) ∪ {pk} (since
i	i	j	j
vj ∈ N (vi)) and Δ2[vi, vj] ⊇ Pi ∪ {vi}∪ Pj ∪ {vj} are redundant. Thus MID(Gk)
exactly contains all 2-element subsets of Pi for each i ∈ {1, 2,..., |V |} and then


2
k1+1
0	···	0	⎞

k	⎜	k2+1
···	0

MID(G )= 
⎜⎝	.
.	. . .
.	⎟⎟⎠

0	0	··· R2
where R2 denotes the matrix whose rows are all the vectors in {0, 1}j with exactly

two 1’s. It is known that the covering number of R2 is j − 1 (see [19]). Hence,
γID(Gk)= k1 + ··· + k|V |.
Now, observe that, N [pj]= {pj, vi} and Δ2[pj, pk]= {pj, pk}. Hence, the rows
i	i	i	i	i	i
corresponding to the sets N [vi]= Pi∪{vi}∪NG(vi), Δ1(vi, vj)= Pi∪{vi}∪Pj ∪{vj},
Δ1(vi, pj) ⊇ {pj, vi}, Δ2[vi, pk] ⊇ Pi ∪{vi} and Δ2[vi, vj] ⊇ Pi ∪{vi} are redundant.
i	i	j
So, MLD(Gk)= MID(Gk) and hence γID(Gk)= γLD(Gk).
Finally, to study γLT D(Gk) observe that the symmetric differences are analogous to the LD-problem, then they are all dominated except from Δ2[pj, pk]= {pj, pk}
i	i	i	i
and N (vi) = Pi ∪ NG(vi) is dominated by Δ2[pj, pk] too.  On the other hand,
i	i
N (pj)= {vi} are not dominated for i ∈ {1,..., |V |}. Thus,
⎛ In	0 ···	0 ⎞
···	0
k	⎜ 0 Rk1

MLT D(G )= 
⎜⎝ .
.	. . .
.	⎟⎟⎠


Therefore, we obtain that γID(Gk)= γLD(Gk)= γLT D(Gk)= k1 + ··· + k|V |.	2

Square of paths and cycles
The square of a graph G = (V, E) is the graph G2 = (V, Ej) where Ej = E ∪ {ij : dist(i, j)= 2}. In this section wes analyze the X-sets, for X ∈ {ID, LD, OLD, LTD} in the case G = Pn and G = Cn.
It is easy to check that γID(P 2) = 4, γID(P 2) = γID(P 2) = γID(P 2) = 5 and

5
γID(P 2)= γID(P 2 )= 6.
6	7	8

9	10
In [14] it is shown that  n+1  ≤ γID(P 2) ≤  n+1 +1 for n ≥ 11. In addition, the
same authors identify the values of n ≥ 11 for which this bounds are attained. Ac- tually, they discuss a generalization of identifying codes, called r-identifying codes.
In general, we have that the r-identifying code number of a graph G equals the identifying code number of the r-th power of G such that the 2-identifying code number of a path equals the identifying code number of the square of this path.
Now, if X = LD or X = LTD, it can be checked that γLD(P 2)= γLT D(P 2)= 
4	4
γLD(P 2) = γLT D(P 2) = 2 and γLD(P 2) = γLT D(P 2) = 3. Moreover, in [13], it is

Remark 4.1 Combining relation (1) with the lower bound for γLD(P 2) in [4], we

have that for every n ≥ 1

(P 2) ≥ γ


(P 2) ≥  n + 1  .

Theorem 4.2 For P 2 with n ≥ 7 we have that

 n + 1   ≤ γ
(P 2) ≤  n + 1   + 1.


Moreover, the lower bound is attained if n = 6k.
Proof (Sketch) For n ≥ 7, let n = 6k + r, with k ≥ 1 and r ∈ {0, 1,..., 5}. We can show that
{4}∪ {6i + 3, 6i +5 : 0 ≤ i ≤ k − 1} for r =0 is an LTD-set of P 2 of cardinality [ n+1 |, and that
n	3
{4, n}∪ {6i + 3, 6i +5 : 0 ≤ i ≤ k − 1} for r = 1,
{4,n − 1}∪ {6i + 3, 6i +5 : 0 ≤ i ≤ k − 1} for r = 2,
{4,n − 1, n}∪ {6i + 3, 6i +5 : 0 ≤ i ≤ k − 1} for r = 3,
{4,n − 3,n − 1}∪ {6i + 3, 6i +5 : 0 ≤ i ≤ k − 1} for r = 4,
{4,n − 2, n}∪ {6i + 3, 6i +5 : 0 ≤ i ≤ k − 1} for r = 5,
are LTD-sets of P 2 of cardinality [ n+1 | + 1.	2
n	3
Finally, it is not hard to check that γOLD(P 2) = 3 and γOLD(P 2) = 4 when
5	n
n = 6, 7, 8, 9.
Theorem 4.3 For P 2 with n ≥ 10, n = 10k + r with r ∈ {0,..., 9} we have that

γOLD
⎧
(P 2) ≤
4k +1 if	r = 0, 1
4k +2 if	r = 2, 3

⎪⎪⎩
4k +3 if	r = 4, 5
4k +4 if r = 6, 7, 8, 9

Proof (Sketch) Let n = 10k + r with k ≥ 1 and r ∈ {0,..., 9}. We can show that
{2i :1 ≤ i ≤ k}− {10i :1 ≤ i ≤ k − 1} when r ∈ {0,..., 7},
{2i :1 ≤ i ≤ k}− {10i :1 ≤ i ≤ k} when r = 8, 9
are OLD-sets with cardinality 4k +1+  r  in the first case and 4k +  r  in the
second case.	2
Finally, computational evidence encourages us to conjecture that Thm. 4.3 in fact gives the exact values for γOLD(P 2).
In a similar way, we will study now the squares of cycles. Note that C2 equals a clique when n ≤ 5 so that no ID-codes exist and γX (C2) is known for X ∈
{LD, OLD, LTD}. If X = ID, γID(C2)= n if n is even and, if n is odd, γID(C2)= 
n	2	n

If X = LD, and n = 6k + r, k ≥ 1, r = 0, 1,... 5, γLD(C2) =  n  +1 if

γLT D(C2)= 3.
Theorem 4.4 For C2 with n ≥ 7, we have that

 n  ≤ γ
(C2) ≤  n  + 1.

Moreover, the lower bound is attained if n = 6k, 6k + 1, 6k + 2, 6k + 4.
Proof. If n ≥ 7, let n = 6k + r, with k ≥ 1 and r ∈ {0, 1,..., 5}. It is not hard to check that:
{6i + 3, 6i +5 : 0 ≤ i ≤ k − 1} if r = 0,
{6i + 3, 6i +5 : 0 ≤ i ≤ k − 1}∪ {n − 1} if r = 1, 2, and
{6i + 3, 6i +5 : 0 ≤ i ≤ k − 1}∪ {n − 3,n − 1} if r = 4,
are LTD-sets of C2 of cardinality [ n |, and
n	3
{6i + 3, 6i +5 : 0 ≤ i ≤ k − 1}∪ {n − 1, n} if r = 3,
{6i + 3, 6i +5 : 0 ≤ i ≤ k − 1}∪ {4,n − 2, n} if r = 5,
are LTD-sets of C2 of cardinality [ n | + 1, but not necessarily minimum.	2
n	3
If X = OLD, it can be easily seen that C2 has false twins and, thus, no OLD-set and that γOLD(C2), γOLD(C2) = 4 holds. Moreover, we can show:
7	8
Theorem 4.5 For C2 with n ≥ 9, we have that

 n  ≤ γ
(C2) ≤ γ
(C2) ≤  n − 2  + 1.

Proof (Sketch) From the general relation (1) and the lower bound for γLT D(C2) given in Thm. 4.4, we conclude the lower bound for γOLD(C2). The upper bound
is true as we can show that
{2i − 1:1 ≤ i < k}∪ {2k − 2} if n = 2k + 1,
{2i − 1:1 ≤ i ≤ k} if n = 2k +2 
form OLD-codes of size k in C2.	2
Note that this implies γLT D(C2)= γOLD(C2) for 9 ≤ n ≤ 11. For 12 ≤ n ≤ 15,
n	n
we know that the upper bound is tight and conjecture this also for all n ≥ 16.
To conclude, we showed that adding a universal vertex changes the studied X- numbers by at most one (but remain the same in the case of paths and cycles), whereas taking the square of a graph can result in very different X-numbers. More- over, the studied X-numbers of generalized coronas of a graph depend in most cases only on the corona, but not on the graph.
