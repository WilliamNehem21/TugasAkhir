Abstract
The complexity of the edge-coloring problem when restricted to chordal graphs, listed in the famous D. John- son’s NP-completeness column of 1985, is still undetermined. A conjecture of Figueiredo, Meidanis, and Mello, open since the late 1990s, states that all chordal graphs of odd maximum degree Δ have chromatic index equal to Δ. This conjecture has already been proved for proper interval graphs (a subclass of proper circular-arc ∩ chordal graphs) of odd Δ by a technique called pullback. Using a new technique called multi-pullback, we show that this conjecture holds for all proper circular-arc ∩ chordal graphs of odd Δ.
We also believe that this technique can be used for further results on edge-coloring other graph classes.
Keywords: Pullback, circular-arc, chromatic index, edge-coloring, chordal


Introduction
Circular-arc graphs are the intersection graphs of a finite set of arcs on a circle. If no arc properly contains another, the graph is said to be a proper circular-arc graph. If all the arcs have the same length, the graph is said to be a unit circular-arc graph. Although the class of the circular-arc graphs is well studied, very little is known about deciding the chromatic index of these graphs, except for the subclass consisting of the n-vertex proper circular-arc graphs of odd maximum degree Δ

which have n /≡1, Δ (mod (Δ + 1)) and a maximal clique of size two, or which have
n ≡ 0 (mod (Δ + 1)) [1].
Circular-arc graphs form a superclass of interval graphs. An important difference between these two classes is that interval graphs have a linear number of maximal cliques (in the number of vertices), while circular-arc graphs may have an exponential number of maximal cliques. This may suggest why some problems are more difficult for circular-arc graphs than for interval graphs. For instance, vertex-coloring is polynomial for interval graphs, but NP-hard for circular-arc graphs [4].
The NP-hard [5] edge-coloring problem is the problem of determining the min- imum amount of colors needed to color the edges of a graph such that no two adjacent edges receive the same color. This amount is called the chromatic index of G, denoted χj(G). By definition, χj(G) ≥ Δ(G) for any graph G. The cele- brated Vizing’s Theorem brings that χj(G) ≤ Δ(G)+1 [10]. Therefore, graphs which satisfy χj(G)= Δ(G) are referred to as Class 1 graphs, and those satisfying χj(G)= Δ(G)+1 are referred to as Class 2. For instance, a complete graph Kn is Class 1 if n is even, and Class 2 otherwise.
We solve the edge-coloring problem in the class of proper circular-arc ∩ chordal (PCAC) graphs of odd maximum degree, that is, we prove that all these graphs are Class 1 and our proof yields a polynomial-time exact edge-coloring algorithm for these graphs. It is important to remark that even for proper interval graphs (often referred to as indiﬀerence graphs in the literature), which form an important subclass of PCAC graphs, the problem is solved only for graphs with odd maximum degree Δ, by a technique called pullback [2]. Later, this technique was also used to solve the edge-coloring problem for all dually chordal graphs (which form a superclass of interval graphs) of odd Δ [3]. The complexity of determining the chromatic index of chordal graphs is one of the problems in the famous D. Johnson’s NP-completeness
column [6] which are still open, even restricted to graphs of odd Δ.
To solve the problem for the PCAC graphs of odd maximum degree, we design a new technique called multi-pullback, which we suspect that can be used for other graph classes.
This paper is organized as follows: the remaining of this section is dedicated to some preliminary definitions; in Section 2 we discuss the pullback functions intro- duced in [2] and present our multi-pullback functions; then, in Section 3 we present our results on PCAC graphs using the multi-pullback functions introduced in Sec- tion 2.

Preliminary definitions
In this paper, graph-theoretical definitions follow their usual meanings in the literature. In particular, G = (V (G), E(G)) is a graph, V (G) is the set of vertices of G and E(G) is the set of edges of G. An edge uv is said to be incident to the vertices u and v, and the vertices u and v are said to be neighbors. The degree of a vertex u, denoted dG(u), is the number of edges that are incident to the vertex u. The maximum degree of G is Δ(G) := max{dG(u): u ∈ V (G)}. The open neighborhood of u is the set NG(u) := {v : uv ∈ E(G)}. The closed neighborhood of u is the set

NG[u] := NG(u) ∪ {u}.
If NG[u] = V (G), then the vertex u is said to be universal in G. We say that a graph H is a subgraph of G if V (H) ⊂ V (G) and E(H) ⊂ E(G).  Let U ⊂ V (G). The subgraph of G induced by U is defined by G[U ] := (U, {uv ∈ E(G): u, v ∈ U}). Let F ⊂ E(G). The subgraph of G induced by F is defined by G[F ] := ({u : uv ∈ F for some v ∈ V (G), F ). The core of a graph is the subgraph induced by its vertices of maximum degree. The semi-core of a graph is the subgraph induced by the vertices of maximum degree and their neighbors.
A k-edge-coloring of G is a proper edge-coloring of G with k colors, that is, an assignment of colors to the edges of a graph in such a way that no two adjacent edges receive the same color and that at most k colors are used. A set U ⊂ V (G) is said to be a clique if it induces a complete graph in G. A clique is said to be maximal if it is not properly contained in any other clique. A simplicial vertex in G is a vertex that belongs to only one maximal clique of G.

Pullback and multi-pullback functions
A function f : V (G) → V (Gj) is said to be a pullback if it is a homomorphism (i.e. for all uv ∈ E(G) we have f (u)f (v) ∈ E(Gj)), and if f is injective when restricted to NG[u] for all u ∈ V (G).
Lemma 2.1 ([2,3]) If f is a pullback from G to Gj and λj is an edge-coloring of Gj, then the function λ(uv) := λj(f (u)f (y)) is an edge-coloring of G.

Definition 2.2 Let G = (V, E) be a graph with E /=∅ and let {E1,..., Et} be a partition of E. A multi-pullback F from G to a collection of t graphs {Gj ,..., Gj }
1	t
is a collection of t functions {f1,..., ft} such that:
fi is a pullback from G[Ei] to Gj ;
there is some positive integer k and some collection of k-edge-colorings λj ,..., λj
1	t
of Gj ,..., Gj , respectively, such that the edge-colorings obtained from λj ,..., λj
1	t	1	t
and the pullbacks f1,..., ft do not create any color conflict on the edges of G, that is, the function defined by
λ(uv) := λj (fi(u)fi(v)) ,	being Ei the set of the partition to which uv belongs, is a proper k-edge-coloring of G.

Observe the necessity of including (ii) in Definition 2.2, otherwise the pullbacks f1,..., ft could define non-compatible edge-colorings (that is, color conflicts could be created when assembling all edge-colorings in order to construct the edge-coloring of G). Also in the definition, observe that disjointness is assumed only among the sets of the partition {E1,..., Et}, but not among the domains of the functions in F , which are sets of vertices, not edges. This means that a single vertex u can be
mapped to a vertex v of Gj by a pullback fi and to a different vertex w of Gj by
a pullback fj, depending on which role we want u to assume in order to color each
edge incident to u.
Figure 2 shows an example of a collection of functions {f1, f2, f3} which can be verified to be a multi-pullback from a PCAC graph G with Δ=5 to the K6, under

The result
Proper circular-arc graphs have the consecutive 1’s property [9], i.e. there is a circular order for the vertices in such a way that for every edge −u→v under the clockwise
orientation of the edges along this order, all the vertices clockwise between u and v induce a complete graph in the original undirected graph. This order is called a proper circular-arc order.
Lemma 3.1 Let G be a PCAC graph of odd maximum degree. If G has a universal vertex, or if the semi-core of G is an indiﬀerence graph, then G is Class 1.

Proof Observe first that if G has a universal vertex, then G is a subgraph of KΔ(G)+1 and hence Class 1. On the other hand, if the semi-core of G is an indiffer- ence graph, then G is also Class 1 because the chromatic index of a graph is equal to the chromatic index of its semi-core [7], and because all indifference graphs of odd maximum degree are Class 1 [2].	2
Lemma 3.2 below provides a full characterization of the structure of proper circular-arc ∩ chordal graphs which do not satisfy Lemma 3.1.
Lemma 3.2 If G is a PCAC graph of odd maximum degree with no universal vertex such that the semi-core S of G is not an indiﬀerence graph, then S = G and there is a 6-partition {YA, YAB, YB, YBC, YC, YAC} of V (G) which splits any proper circular- arc order σ of G into six contiguous subsequences of σ in a manner that, being the cardinality of each set in the partition denoted by lowercase y with the corresponding subscript:
the graph G has exactly four maximal cliques, which can be given by XA :=
{YAB ∪ YA ∪ YAC}, XB := {YBC ∪ YB ∪ YAB}, XC := {YAC ∪ YC ∪ YBC},
and Z = {YAB ∪ YAC ∪ YBC},wherein XA is assumed without loss of generality to be of maximum size among the cliques XA, XB, and XC, which are the cliques which appear contiguously in σ (that is, all the vertices in each of these cliques appear consecutively in σ);
all the vertices in YAB and in YAC have degree Δ(G) in G;
Δ(G)= yA + yB + yAB + yBC + yAC − 1= yA + yC + yAB + yBC + yAC − 1;
yA ≥ yB = yC;
Proof Let σ be a proper circular-arc order of G and let (X0, X1,   , Xt−1) be the
maximal cliques that appear contiguously in σ. We must have t ≥ 3, otherwise it can be straightforwardly shown that G is an indifference graph.
We claim that there is no Xi such that Xi ⊂ X(i−1) mod t ∪ X(i+1) mod t. If this claim holds, an induced cycle of size t is easily obtained by choosing one vertex from each Xi ∩ X(i+1) mod t. Because G is chordal and it is not an indifference graph, we have t = 3. These three maximal cliques of G that appear contiguously in σ are XA, XB, and XC, respectively.
Since G is not an indifference graph, we have that the intersection of two con- secutive cliques in σ is not empty (otherwise in any circular-arc model of G there would be a point on the circumference which would be uncovered by any arc). We define the sets YAB := XA ∩ XB, YBC := XB ∩ XC, and YAC := XA ∩ XC, and also YA := XA \ (YAB ∪ YAC), YB := XB \ (YAB ∪ YBC), and YC := XC \ (YAC ∪ YBC).
As all the vertices in YAB ∪ YBC ∪ YAC are neighbors of each other, there is a fourth maximal clique Z := YAB ∪ YBC ∪ YAC that does not appear contiguously in σ.
Up to this point, we have proven that if the claim holds then there are at least three maximal cliques (XA, XB, and XC) which appear contiguously in σ, as well as the fourth clique Z. We have also proven that the sets YAB, YBC, and YAC are not empty. We can further demonstrate that the sets YA, YB, and YC are non-empty, which is equivalent to prove that each of the cliques XA, XB, and XC has a simplicial

vertex. If YA = ∅, then every vertex of YBC is universal (see Figure 3), contradicting the hypothesis. The non-emptiness of YB and YC follows analogously.


Figure 3. Structure of a PCAC graph according to Lemma 3.2.

Now we shall prove the claim and that XA, XB, and XC are the only maximal cliques contiguously in σ. Assume for the sake of contradiction that there is a fourth maximal clique XD contiguously in σ. Since the intersections YAB, YBC, and YAC are all non-empty, the clique XD must be contained in the union of two cliques from
{XA, XB, XC}. Without loss of generality, XD ⊂ XA ∪XB. By the same arguments presented above, the four sets (XD ∩ XA) \ (XB ∪ XC), (XD ∩ XB) \ (XA ∪ XC), (XB ∩ XC) \ XD, and (XC ∩ XA) \ XD are all non-empty.  Ergo, by choosing
four vertices, one from each of these sets, we obtain an induced cycle of size four, contradicting the fact that G is chordal. Hence, we have proven that XD cannot exist and also that the claim holds. Furthermore, since all the vertices in YA, YB, and YC are simplicial, the only maximal clique which can be formed not contiguously in σ is the clique Z (recall Figure 3).
Assuming without loss of generality that XA is of maximum size among XA, XB, and XC, it remains to demonstrate (ii)–(iv). Clearly, the vertices of maximum degree in G are in YAB ∪ YBC ∪ YAC. We shall demonstrate that either YAB and YAC, or all the sets from {YAB, YAC, YBC} have vertices of maximum degree (this
proves (ii)). If only one set I from {YAB, YAC, YBC} has vertices of maximum de- gree in G, then surely I /=YBC, because of the assumption on the cardinality of XA. If I = YAB, then the semi-core of G is an indifference graph, because the order YB, YBC, YAB, YAC, YA is an indifference order 7. The case I = YAC follows
analogously. Remark that this also proves that the semi-core of G equals G.
Notice that vertices which belong to the same set from {YA, YAB, YB, YBC, YC, YAC} have the same closed neighborhood and hence the same degree. Let u be a vertex in YAB, v a vertex in YAC, and w a vertex in YBC. We know that Δ(G)= dG(u)= dG(v) ≥ dG(w) and also that:
dG(u)= yBC + yB + yAB + yA + yAC − 1 ; dG(v)= yAB + yA + yAC + yC + yBC − 1 ; dG(w)= yAB + yB + yBC + yC + yAC − 1 .

7 An indifference order of an indifference graph is a linear order of the vertices so that vertices belonging to the same maximal clique appear consecutively in this order [8].

From these equations, we have (iii) and also that yB = yC and yA ≥ yB, completing the proof of (iv).	2
Theorem 3.3 Every proper circular-arc ∩ chordal graph with odd maximum degree is Class 1.
Proof In view of Lemma 3.1, let G be a PCAC graph of odd maximum degree with no universal vertex such that the semi-core of G is not an indifference graph. Let also {YA, YAB, YB, YBC, YC, YAC} be a partition of V (G) as in Lemma 3.2 (recall Figure 3). Let {E1, E2, E3, E4} be the partition of E(G) defined by:
E1 := E(G[YA ∪ YAB ∪ YB ∪ YBC ∪ YAC]) ;
E2 := {uv : u ∈ YAC and v ∈ C} ; E3 := {uv : u ∈ YBC and v ∈ C} ; E4 := E(G[C]) .
Let V (KΔ(G)+1)= {0,..., Δ(G)} and V (KyC )= {0,.  ,c − 1}. We shall construct
a multi-pullback {f1, f2, f3, f4} with fi : Vi → Gj , for all i ∈ {1,.  , 4}, being
V1 := YA ∪ YAB ∪ YB ∪ YBC ∪ YAC ,
V2 := YAC ∪ YC , V3 := YBC ∪ YC , V4 := YC ,

of KΔ(G)+1 defined in (1), and λj is the Δ(G)-edge-coloring of Ky
C
defined by

fj (uv)= (2yAC + yA + yC + yBC + u + v) mod Δ(G) .
Remark that λj is an optimal edge-coloring of KΔ(G)+1 (which is Class 1 since Δ(G)
is odd) and that λ4 is surely not optimal, since c < Δ(G) − 2.
Remark by Lemma 3.2 that |V1| = Δ(G)+ 1. In order to define f1, take any bijective labeling function satisfying:
f1(YAC)= {0,..., yAC − 1} ;
f1(YA)= {yAC,..., yAC + yA − 1} ;
f1(YB)= {yAC + yA,..., yAC + yA + yB − 1} ;
f1(YBC)= {yAC + yA + yB,..., yAC + yA + yB + yBC − 1} ;
f1(YAB)= {yAC + yA + yB + yBC,..., yAC + yA + yB + yBC + yAB − 1} .
Here, we use f1(Z) to denote  z∈Z{f1(z)}. Notice that we have used Δ(G)+1 distinct labels, from 0 to Δ(G), and it is easy to realize that this labeling is a pullback from G[E1] to the Gj .
It remains to color the edges incident to the vertices of YC, that is, it remains to define f2,..., f4. Remark that G[E2 ∪ E3] is a bipartite graph, with parts YC and

YBC ∪ YAC, and G[E4] is a complete graph. Figure 4 represents the sets YBC, YC, and YAC.

Figure 4. The sets YBC , YC , and YAC

Recall that G[E2] is the bipartite graph induced by the edges between YAC and YC, and notice that the edges incident to vertices in YAC are not incident to vertices in YB. This is why we can define f2 by assigning to the vertices of YAC the same labels which they have been assigned by f1, and to the vertices of YC the same labels assigned to the vertices of YB by f1, in the manner that we clarify in the sequel. As yB = yC, there will be enough labels for all the vertices of YC.
Analogously, the graph G[E3] is the bipartite graph induced by the edges between YBC and YC. Notice that vertices in YBC are not neighbors of vertices in YA, therefore, the labels assigned by f1 to the vertices in YA can be reused by f3 to the vertices in YC (in the manner that we clarify in the sequel), if the vertices in YBC are assigned by f3 the same labels which they have been assigned by f1. Recall that yA ≥ yC, so there will be enough labels.
To complete the proof, it remains only to define which are the three labels as- signed to each vertex in YC by f2, f3, and f4, and to show that the edge-coloring obtained through these pullbacks do not create color conflicts in G.  Let YC =
{u0,..., uyC−1}. We define for each ui ∈ YC the triplet (f2(ui), f3(ui), f4(ui)) := (yAC + yA + i, yAC + i, i). Let λ be the Δ(G)-edge-coloring of G as in Definition 2.2.
We show that λ is a proper edge-coloring, for which it suffices to show that all the colors of the edges incident to the same vertex ui in YC are different.
The colors of the edges incident to ui can be verified to be as follows (all the colors listed below are modΔ(G), but this information is omitted for a clear description):
the colors of the edges of G[E2] that are incident to ui are the yAC colors from the set
{yAC + yA + i,..., 2yAC + yA + i − 1} ;
the colors of the edges of G[E3] that are incident to ui are the yBC colors from the set
{2yAC + yA + yB + i,..., 2yAC + yA + yB + yBC + i − 1} ;
the colors of the edges of G[E4] that are incident to ui are the yC − 1 colors from the set
{2yAC+yA+yB+yBC+i,...,   2yAC+yA+2yB+yBC+i}\{2yAC+yB+yB+yBC+2i}   ;
Notice that, at the edges incident to ui, the yB colors between (2yAC + yA + i) mod Δ(G) and (2yAC + yA + yB + i − 1) mod Δ(G) are not used, as well as the color

(2yAC + yA + yB + yBC + 2i) mod Δ(G). As yAC + yB + yBC + yC ≤ Δ(G) = 
yAC + yBC + yAB + yA + yC − 1, there is no color conflict at ui.
Since we have shown that there is no color conflict at any vertex ui ∈ YC, we conclude that G is Class 1.	2
