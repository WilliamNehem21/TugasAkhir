Abstract
For a finite, simple, undirected graph G = (V (G),E(G)), an open-dominating set S ⊆ V (G) is such that every vertex in G has at least one neighbor in S. An open-independent, open-locating-dominating set S ⊆ V (G) (OLDOIND-set for short) is such that no two vertices in G have the same set of neighbors in S and each vertex in S is open-dominated exactly once by S. The problem of deciding whether or not a given graph has an OLDOIND-set is known to be NP-complete. The complementary prism of G is the graph GG¯, formed from the disjoint union of G and its complement G¯ by adding the edges of a perfect matching between the corresponding vertices of G and G¯. We provided a logarithmic lower bound on the size of an OLDOIND-set in any graph. Various properties of and bounds on OLDOIND-sets in complementary prisms were presented and the cases of cliques, paths and cycles have been completely solved. It has been shown that for any graph with girth at least five, it can be decided in polynomial time whether or not its complementary prism has an OLD-OIND-set (and also the set can be found in polynomial time if it exists).
Keywords: open-independent sets, open-locating-dominating sets, complementary prisms of graphs, complexity.


Introduction
Consider the situation where a graph G models a facility or a multiprocessor net- work, with limited-range detection devices placed at chosen vertices of G. The purpose of these devices is to detect and precisely identify the location of an in- truder such as a thief, saboteur, fire or faulty processor that may be present at any vertex. Sometimes such a device can determine if an intruder is in its neighborhood but cannot detect if the intruder is at its own location. In this case, it is required to find a so-called, open-locating-dominating vertex subset S, which is a dominating

set of G, such that every vertex in G has at least one neighbor in S, and no two vertices in G have the same set of neighbors in S. When a device may be prevented from detecting an intruder at its own location, it is necessary to install another de- vice in its neighborhood. A natural way to analyze such situations is to make use of open neighborhood sets which may have useful additional properties, such as being open-independent, dominating, open-dominating or open-locating-dominating.
Throughout this paper, lg(x) denotes log2(x), and G = (V (G), E(G)) is a finite, simple, undirected graph with vertex set V (G) and edge set E(G). Let S ⊆ V (G). The subgraph of G induced by S is denoted by G[S].
The open neighborhood of a vertex v ∈ V (G) is NG(v) = {u ∈ V (G) | vu ∈
E(G)}, and its closed neighborhood is NG[v]= NG(v)∪{v}. The open neighborhood

of S is NG(S) = S

v∈S
NG(v) and its closed neighborhood is NG[S] = NG(S) ∪ S.

Such a set S is termed dominating if NG[S] = V (G) and open-dominating (or
total dominating) if NG(S)= V (G). A vertex v ∈ V (G) is dominated by S if
|N [v] ∩ S| ≥ 1 and is open-dominated by S if |N (v) ∩ S| ≥ 1. The set S is a locating-dominating set if it is a dominating set and for every pair of distinct vertices u, v ∈ V (G)\S, N (u)∩S /= N (v)∩S. S is an open-locating-dominating set (OLD-set for short) if it is an open-dominating set and no two distinct vertices in G have the same set of neighbors in S, i.e., for all u, v ∈ V (G), with u /= v, N (u)∩S /= N (v)∩S. For this last condition, u and v are said to be distinguished by S. This is an analogue of the well-studied identifying code problem in the literature [10]. The parameter OLD(G) denotes the minimum size of an OLD set S ⊆ V (G). The concept of an open-locating-dominating set was first considered by Seo and Slater [12]. The authors showed that to decide if a graph G has such a set is an NP-complete decision problem and provided some useful results on OLD-sets in trees and grid graphs. S is independent if no two vertices in S are adjacent, i.e., ∀ v ∈ S, |N [v] ∩S| = 1. S is an open-independent set (OIND-set for short) if every vertex in S is open-dominated by S at most once, i.e., ∀ v ∈ S, |N (v) ∩ S| ≤ 1.
If an open-independent, open-locating-dominating set (OLDOIND-set for short) exists in a given graph G, it is often of interest to establish the minimum size among such sets in G, which is denoted by OLDOIND(G). If S is an OLDOIND-set for G, each component of G[S] is isomorphic to K2 (a complete graph on two vertices). See, for example, the graphs in Figures 1(a) and 1(b), where an OLDOIND-set of each graph is represented by the black vertices. Seo and Slater [13] demonstrated that the problem of deciding whether or not a given graph has an OLDOIND-set is NP-complete. The authors also presented some results on OLDOIND-sets in paths, trees and infinite grid graphs, and characterized OLDOIND-sets in graphs with girth at least five.
Haynes et al. [6] introduced the so-called complementary product as a gener- alization of the well-known Cartesian product of graphs. As a particular case of complementary products, the authors define the complementary prism of a graph G, denoted by GG¯, as the graph formed from the disjoint union of G and its com- plement G¯ by adding the edges of the perfect matching between the corresponding vertices of G and G¯. Note that V (GG¯)= V (G)∪V (G¯). For the purposes of illustra-

tion, a graph G, its complement G¯ and the complementary prism GG¯ are depicted in Figure 1. To simplify matters, we use G and G¯ to refer to the subgraph copies of G and G¯, respectively, in GG¯. We term as primary the vertices and edges in G, as complementary the vertices and edges in G¯ and as matching any edge vv¯ that directly connects a vertex v ∈ V (G) and a vertex v¯ ∈ V (G¯. For a set X ⊆ V (G), let X¯ denote the corresponding vertices of X in V (G¯).
Haynes et al. [6] investigated several graph theoretic properties of complemen-
tary prisms, such as independence, distance and domination. For further study on domination parameters in complementary prisms, see [1,3,4,7,8,9,11]. Cappelle et al. [2] described a polynomial time recognition algorithm for complementary prisms and Duarte et al. [5] studied algorithmic/complexity properties of complementary prisms with respect to cliques, independent sets, domination, and convexity. Here we study open-independent, open-locating-dominating sets in the complementary prisms of graphs. Various properties of and bounds on OLDOIND-sets in comple- mentary prisms were presented and the cases of cliques, paths and cycles have been completely solved. Our main result is that if the girth of G is at least five, then the
OLDOIND-set of GG¯, if it exists, can be found in polynomial time.
Some preliminary results for OLDOIND-sets
The following theorem provides necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an OLDOIND-set in a graph G that has girth g(G) ≥ 5. For general graphs (with arbitrary girth), the conditions stated in Theorem 2.1 are necessary but not sufficient, as is stated in Lemma 2.2.
Theorem 2.1 ([13]) If a graph G has girth g(G) ≥ 5 and S ⊆ V (G), then S is an OLDOIND-set if and only if (i) each v ∈ S is open-dominated exactly once, and
(ii) each v ∈/ S is open-dominated at least twice.
Lemma 2.2 If S ⊆ V (G) is an OLDOIND-set of a graph G, then (i) each v ∈ S is open-dominated exactly once, and (ii) each v ∈ V (G) \ S is open-dominated at least twice.
A corollary to Lemma 2.2 is that if S exists, the components of G[S] are of order two. The complexity of deciding whether or not a given graph has an OLDOIND-set is established in the following theorem.

Theorem 2.3 ([13]) Deciding, for a given graph G, whether or not G has an
OLDOIND-set is an NP-complete decision problem.
The next proposition provides a sharp logarithmic lower bound on the size of an OLDOIND-set of any graph G, if G has such a set.
Proposition 2.4 For a given graph G of order n, if G has an OLDOIND-set, then
OLDOIND(G) ≥ lg(n + 1).	(1)
Proof. Let S be an OLDOIND-set of G with |S| = k and A = V (G) \ S. By Lemma 2.2, for every v ∈ A, we have |N (v) ∩ S| ≥ 2. Since for any two vertices u, v ∈ A, N (u) ∩ S /= N (v) ∩ S, the size of A is bounded by all combinations of at least two vertices taken from S. So, |A| ≤ 2k − k − 1. Hence n ≤ 2k − 1 and thus k ≥ lg(n + 1).	2
It is possible to construct an infinite class of graphs that attains the bound in
(1). Let k = 2p, where p is a positive integer and n = 2k − 1. For every i = 1,.  , n,
let vi be a vertex of G. For every j = 1,..., p, let v2j−1v2j be an edge of G. Let
X = {Xk+1,. , Xn} be the set of sets of all combinations of at least two vertices taken from {v1,..., vk}. Now, for i = k + 1,.  , n, let vi be adjacent to each vertex
of Xi and S = {v1,..., vk}. Note that every vertex of S is open-dominated exactly once by the vertices of S and every vertex of V (G) \ S is open-dominated at least twice. Furthermore, for any two vertices u, v ∈ V (G) \ S, N (u) ∩ S /= N (v) ∩ S. Therefore, n = 2k − 1 and S is an OLDOIND-set of G of size k = lg(n + 1).
Some results for complementary prisms
Next we consider OLDOIND-sets in the complementary prisms of graphs. In any OLDOIND-set of a complementary prism there is at most one pair of matched vertices, as proved in Lemma 3.1. Moreover, the OLDOIND-set has at least one vertex of G and at least one vertex of G¯, as demonstrated in Lemma 3.2.
Lemma 3.1 For a given graph G, if GG¯ has an OLDOIND-set S = S0 ∪ S¯1 with S0 ⊆ V (G) and S¯1 ⊆ V (G¯), then there is at most one matching edge uu¯ ∈ GG¯[S] with u ∈ S0 and u¯ ∈ S¯1.
Proof. Suppose S is an OLDOIND-set in GG¯ as described and assume there are two distinct matching edges uu¯ and vv¯ say, in GG¯[S], such that {u, v} ⊆ S0 and

{u¯, v¯} ⊆ S¯1. Since GG¯
is a complementary prism, either (i) edge uv ∈ G (and

vertices u and v open-dominate each other) or else (ii) edge u¯v¯ ∈ G¯ (and vertices u¯
and v¯ open-dominate each other). But vertices u and u¯ open-dominate each other, and vertices v and v¯ open-dominate each other. Thus, condition (i) of Lemma 2.2 does not hold, which is a contradiction.	2
Lemma 3.2 For a given graph G, if GG¯ has an OLDOIND-set S = S0 ∪ S¯1 with
S0 ⊆ V (G) and S¯1 ⊆ V (G¯), then S0 /= ∅ and S¯1 /= ∅.

Proof. For a proof by contradiction, suppose S0 = ∅. Let v ∈ V (G). By Lemma 2.2, vertex v has to be open-dominated at least twice. Since v has at most one neighbor in S¯1, we can conclude that S is not an OLDOIND-set in GG¯. The proof for S¯1 follows analogously.	2
In the following Lemma we present some bounds on the sizes of some subsets of vertices of GG¯, when GG¯ has an OLDOIND-set.

Lemma 3.3 Let G be a graph of order n such that GG¯
has an OLDOIND-set

S = S0 ∪ S¯1 with S0 ⊆ V (G), S¯1 ⊆ V (G¯), then
if S contains the endpoints of a matching edge vv¯, consider the following sets:
A = NG(v), B = V (G) \ (A ∪ {v}), A1 = (V (G) ∩ N (S¯1)) \ {v}, A2 = A \ A1,
and B1 = B \ S0. Then, |A2| ≤ min{2|S0|−1 − 1, 2|S¯1|−1 − |S¯1|} and |B1| ≤
min{2|S¯1|−1 − 1, 2|S0|−1 − |S0|}.
if S does not contain the endpoints of a matching edge and r = min{|S0|, |S¯1|}, then n − |S0|− |S¯1| ≤ 2r − r − 1.

Proof. Assume that S = S0 ∪ S¯1 is an OLDOIND-set in GG¯
with S0 ⊆ V (G),

S¯1 ⊆ V (G¯). The reader is referred to Figure 2. To prove (i), let A, B, A1, A2,
and B1 be the sets as described above and B2 = B \ B1 = S0 \ {v}. Observe that S0 = {v}∪ B2 and S¯1 = {v¯}∪ A¯1. For every X ∈ {A1, A2, B1, B2} let X¯ be the set of corresponding vertices of X in G¯. Note that the sets A, B and {v} together partition V (G) and A¯, B¯ and {v¯} together partition V (G¯). The vertices in A1 are open-dominated by v and distinguished from each other by the vertices in S¯1. Note that NGG¯ (A2) ∩ S¯1 = ∅. Since A2 ⊆ NGG¯ (v), every u ∈ A2 is open- dominated by v and distinguished by the vertices in B2. So, for every distinct pair u, x ∈ A2, the sets (NG(u) ∩ B2) and (NG(x) ∩ B2) are distinct and non empty.
Thus |A2| ≤ 2|B2| − 1 = 2|S0|−1 − 1. Now consider the set A¯2. Every w¯ ∈ A¯2
must be open-dominated and distinguished by the vertices in A¯1. So, for every
distinct pair w¯, y¯ ∈ A2, the sets (NG¯ (w¯) ∩ B2) and (NG¯ (y¯) ∩ B2) are distinct and non empty. Thus |A¯2| ≤ 2|A¯1| − |A¯1|− 1, and since |A2| = |A¯2| and |A¯1| = |S¯1|− 1, we can conclude that |A2| ≤ min{2|S0|−1 − 1, 2|S¯1|−1 − |S¯1|}. By symmetry, |B1| ≤ min{2|A1| − 1, 2|B2| − |B2|}, i.e. |B1| ≤ min{2|S¯1|−1 − 1, 2|S0|−1 − |S0|}.
To prove (ii), assume r = min{|S0|, |S¯1|} and S does not contain the endpoints of
a matching edge. Following Figure 2(b), let S1 be the set of corresponding vertices of S¯1 in V (G), S¯0 be the set of corresponding vertices of S0 in V (G¯), C be the set V (G)\(S1∪S0) and C¯ be the corresponding vertices of C in V (G¯). Note that the sets S1, C and S0 together partition V (G), and S¯0, C¯ and S¯1 together partition V (G¯). The vertices in S1 are distinguished from each other by S¯1 and every vertex in S1 is also dominated at least once by the vertices of S0. By construction, N (C) ∩ S¯1 = ∅. For every distinct pair u, x ∈ C, we have that (N (u) ∩ S0) /= (N (x) ∩ S0). So, using the same argument as in the proof of Theorem 2.4, we can conclude that
|C| ≤ 2|S0| − |S0|− 1. Analogously, |C¯| ≤ 2|S¯1| − |S¯1|− 1. Since |C| = |C¯| and
r = min{|S0|, |S¯1|}, |C| = n − |S0|− |S¯1| is bounded by 2r − r − 1, where n is the
order of G.	2

Next we sharpen the bound presented in Proposition 2.4 for complementary prisms.


Theorem 3.4 Let G be a graph of order n such that GG¯
Then,
has an OLDOIND-set.

2 lg(n + 1) − 2 ≤ OLDOIND(GG¯) ≤ n + 1.	(2)
Furthermore, these bounds are sharp.
Proof. Let G be a graph of order n such that GG¯ has an OLDOIND-set S = S0 ∪S¯1 with S0 ⊆ V (G), S¯1 ⊆ V (G¯). To prove the upper bound in (2), assume that OLDOIND(GG¯) ≥ n + 2. Then GG¯[S] has at least two matching edges. But, by Lemma 3.1, every OLDOIND-set has at most one matching edge, a contradiction, which completes the proof. Note that the upper bound in (2) is tight, for instance, when GG¯ = P3P¯3 or C5C¯5.
To begin the proof of the lower bound in (2), let |S0| = k0 and |S¯1| = k1 with
k0, k1 ≥ 1. We consider the cases where (i) S contains the endpoints of a matching edge, and (ii) S does not contain the endpoints of a matching edge. By symmetry, for each of (i) and (ii), we can assume that k0 ≥ k1, and need consider only the subcases (a) 2k1 ≥ k0 and (b) k0 > 2k1 .
Case (i). By the definition of an OLDOIND-set, k0 and k1 are positive, odd integers. Consider the sets A2 and B1 defined in Lemma 3.3(i). Since |A2| ≤ min{2k0−1 − 1, 2k1−1 − k1}, |B1| ≤ min{2k1−1 − 1, 2k0−1 − k0} and n = k0 + k1 − 1+ 
|A2| + |B1| it follows that n ≤ k0 + k1 − 1+ 2k1−1 − k1 + 2k1−1 − 1 and thus



n +2 ≤ k0 + 2k1 .	(3)
Subcase i(a). From (3) we have that
n +2 ≤ 2k1+1	(4)


and thus
lg(n + 2) − 1 ≤ k1.	(5)



Subcase i(b). From (3) we have that
n +2 ≤ 2k0.	(6)



and thus
lg(n + 2) − 1 ≤ lg(k0).	(7)

Case (ii). Here k0 and k1 are positive, even integers. Consider the set C defined in Lemma 3.3(ii). Since |C| ≤ min{2k0 − k0 − 1, 2k1 − k1 − 1} and n = k0 + k1 + |C| it follows that n ≤ k0 + k1 + 2k1 − k1 − 1 and thus
n +1 ≤ k0 + 2k1 .	(8)
Subcase ii(a). From (8) we have that
n +1 ≤ 2k1+1	(9)


and thus
lg(n + 1) − 1 ≤ k1.	(10)

Subcase ii(b). From (8) we have that
n +1 ≤ 2k0.	(11)


and thus
lg(n + 1) − 1 ≤ lg(k0).	(12)

To prove the lower bound in (2) we use the obvious fact that |S| = k0 + k1. Using
(5) and (10), this implies that for Cases i(a) and ii(a), 2 lg(n + 1) − 2 ≤ 2k1 ≤ |S|. Similarly, using (7) and (12) implies that for Cases i(b) and ii(b), 2 lg(n + 1) − 2 ≤ 2 lg(k0) ≤ |S|, and the result follows.
To show that the lower bound in (2) is tight, let GG¯ be the graph constructed as
in Figure 2(b) with 2k0 = n+1 and 2k1+2 = n+1. Note that 2k1 = n+1 > lg(n+1) = k0 > k1 and thus Subcase ii(a) applies. |C| = 2k1 −k1 − 1= (n + 1)/4 − lg(n + 1)+ 1. Finally, S0 ∪ S¯1 is an OLDOIND-set in GG¯ with size k0 + k1 = 2 log(n + 1) − 2, which complete the proof.	2

Lemma 3.5 For a given, nontrivial graph G, if GG¯
has an OLDOIND-set S =

S0 ∪ S¯1 with S0 ⊆ V (G), S¯1 ⊆ V (G¯) and |S¯1| = 1, then G is a disconnected graph.

Furthermore, G is the disjoint union of an isolated vertex and a collection of l K2
subgraphs, where l ≥ 1.
Proof. Let G and S be as described above. If |S¯1| = 1, S contains the endpoints of a matching edge, say vv¯, of GG¯. Thus G consists of an isolated vertex v and a collection of l ≥ 1 disjoint K2 subgraphs and V (G) ∪ {v¯} is an OLDOIND-set for GG¯.	2

Complementary prisms of graphs with girth at least ﬁve
Seo and Slater [13] presented some results about open-independent, open-locating- dominating sets (OLDOIND-sets) in trees. The authors showed that every leaf and its neighbor are contained in any OLDOIND-set of any tree T , if T has such a set. Furthermore, they recursively defined the collection of trees such that each has a unique OLDOIND-set. In this section we study OLDOIND-sets in the complemen- tary prisms of graphs that have girth at least five, which includes all trees. In particular, for a given graph G with girth g(G) ≥ 5, the following result bounds
the number of vertices of V (G¯) that can be members of an OLDOIND-set of the
complementary prism GG¯, of G, if GG¯ has such a set.
Proposition 3.6 For a given connected graph G whose girth satisﬁes g(G) ≥ 5,
if GG¯ has an OLDOIND-set S = S0 ∪ S¯1 with S0 ⊆ V (G) and S¯1 ⊆ V (G¯), then
2 ≤ |S¯1| ≤ 3. Furthermore,
if |S¯1| = 2, then S¯1 consists of the endpoints of a complementary edge in G¯.
if |S¯1| = 3, then S¯1 consists of three distinct vertices in G¯, two of which are the endpoints of a complementary edge in G¯, and the three corresponding vertices in G induce a 3-path in G.
Proof. Suppose a connected graph G whose girth satisfies g(G) ≥ 5 is given and
GG¯ has an OLDOIND-set S = S0 ∪ S¯1 with S0 ⊆ V (G) and S¯1 ⊆ V (G¯).
By Lemma 3.2, S¯1 /= ∅ and, since G is connected, by Lemma 3.5, |S¯1| > 1. Suppose that |S¯1| ≥ 4. By Proposition 3.1, there is at most one matching edge induced by the vertices in S. Hence if |S¯1| ≥ 4, there are two distinct complementary
edges u¯1u¯2 and v¯1v¯2 ∈ GG¯, with {u¯1, u¯2, v¯1, v¯2} ⊆ S¯1. By Lemma 2.2, the set
{u¯1, u¯2, v¯1, v¯2} induces a graph isomorphic to 2K2 in G, hence {u1, u2, v1, v2} induces
a cycle of order 4 in G. This contradicts the assumption that g(G) ≥ 5 which completes this part of the proof.
To prove (i), let S¯1 = {u¯, v¯}. Since, by Lemma 3.1, there is at most one matching edge in G[S] between the vertices in S0 and in S¯1, we can conclude that S¯1 consists

of the endpoints of the complementary edge
u¯v¯ in GG¯. In order to prove (ii),

let S¯1 = {u¯, v¯, x¯}. By Lemma 3.1 and the definition of an OLDOIND-set, G[S]
must contain at least two components isomorphic to K2, one of them containing a matching edge and the other a complementary edge. So S¯1 consists of a vertex that is an endpoint of a matching edge in GG¯ and the endpoints of a complementary

edge in G¯. Suppose that edges in GG¯
match u¯, v¯ and x¯ with u, v and x in G,

respectively. Without loss of generality, suppose there is an edge u¯v¯ ∈ E(GG¯).

Since S in an OLDOIND-set, there is no edge between u¯ and x¯, nor between v¯ and
x¯. So u, v and x induce a P3 in G.	2
We present some examples of complementary prisms to illustrate Proposition
3.6. As an illustration of (i), consider the path graph P4 = ⟨v1, v2, v3, v4⟩. Then
{v¯1, v2, v3, v¯4} is an OLDOIND-set for P4P¯4 with S¯1 = {v¯1, v¯4} and the comple-

mentary edge
v¯1v¯4 ∈ E(P¯4) (see Figure 3(a)).	As an illustration of (ii), con-

sider P3 = ⟨v1, v2, v3⟩. Then {v¯1, v2, v¯2, v¯3} is an OLDOIND-set for P3P¯3 with
S¯1 = {v¯1, v¯2, v¯3}, the matching edge v2, v¯2 ∈ E(P3P¯3) and the complementary edge v¯1v¯3 ∈ E(P¯3) (Figure 3(b)). Furthermore, there are instances where neither the graph nor its complement has an OLDOIND-set but the complementary prism of the graph does (cf. P3 in (ii) above). Conversely, there are instances where both
a graph and its complement have OLDOIND-sets but the complementary prism of the graph does not. An example is the graph G of Figure 1(a).

In view of Theorem 2.3, another question that arises is, for a given graph G, if the problem of deciding whether or not GG¯ has an OLDOIND-set, remains NP- complete. However, the following result establishes that when we have girth g(G) ≥ 5, the decision problem can be solved in polynomial time.
Theorem 3.7 If G is a nontrivial, connected graph with g(G) ≥ 5, we can decide in polynomial time whether or not GG¯ has an OLDOIND-set S. Furthermore, if S exists, it can be determined in polynomial time.
Proof. Let G be a nontrivial connected graph whose girth satisfies g(G) ≥ 5. We begin by assuming that GG¯ has an OLDOIND-set S = S0 ∪ S¯1 with S0 ⊆ V (G) and S¯1 ⊆ V (G¯). By Proposition 3.6, |S¯1| ∈ {2, 3}. If |S¯1| = 2, S does not contain the endpoints of a matching edge. Consider the set C defined in Lemma 3.3 (ii). Then, n = |S0| + |S¯1| + |C|. By Lemma 3.3 (ii), |C| ≤ 1 and it can be concluded that
|V (G) \ S0| ≤ 3. If |S¯1| = 3, S contains the endpoints of exactly one matching edge.
Consider the sets A2 and B1 defined in the proof of item (i) of Lemma 3.3. Then n = |S0| + |S¯1|− 1+ |A2| + |B1|. Since by Lemma 3.3 (i), |A2| ≤ 1 and |B1| ≤ 3, it follows that |V (G) \ S| ≤ 7. In both cases, by using a brute force approach, it is possible to verify in polynomial time which vertices of GG¯ must correspond to S0 and S¯1.
Since S¯1 is bounded by a constant, if S exists, it can be found in polynomial
time and S0 can be deduced from it in polynomial time. It must be considered all possible guesses for S¯1 and either successfully complete the corresponding solution S or decide that such a set is impossible. Assume that every checking step succeeds.

If something within any step goes wrong, then the corresponding combination of guesses cannot lead to a solution.
Note that the algorithm is based on the fact that if graph GG¯ has an OLDOIND- set S with S0 ⊆ V (G), S¯1 ⊆ V (G¯), then |S¯1|∈ {2, 3}. Since it is possible that more than one case can occur, it is necessary to compare the sizes of S0 induced by each
of the cases, assume the best case and proceed with the lower size.	2
For some graphs G it is not possible to bound the size of the set S¯1 in GG¯ and the size of S can be arbitrarily large. Consequently, we present Conjecture 3.8 which states that the problem of deciding if a graph has an OLDOIND-set remains NP-complete even for complementary prisms.
Conjecture 3.8 Deciding, for a given graph G, whether or not GG¯ has an open- independent, open-locating-dominating set is an NP-complete decision problem.
Complementary prisms of some particular graph classes
We study OLDOIND-sets in the complementary prisms of some particular graph classes. It is easy to see that if G is a complete graph Kn, with n ≥ 1, GG¯ has an OLDOIND-set if and only if n = 1. Next we consider the complementary prism of cycles and paths.
The complementary prisms of the n-cycle Cn (n ≥ 3) and the n-path Pn (n ≥ 1) are denoted by CnC¯n and PnP¯n, respectively. When n = 5, CnC¯n is the Petersen graph which has domination number 3 and independence number 4. Henceforth, the vertex set of Cn or Pn is represented as the set {v1, v2,.  , vn} and the vertex
set of C¯n or P¯n is represented as {v¯1, v¯2,.  , v¯n}. We identify indexes of vertices of
G modulo n.
As will be seen, only a few cycle graphs have complementary prisms with an OLDOIND-set. It can easily be checked that for n ∈ {3, 4, 7} the graph CnC¯n has no OLDOIND-set. On the other hand, OLDOIND(C5C¯5)= OLDOIND(C6C¯6)=6 and OLDOIND(C8C¯8)= OLDOIND(C9C¯9) = 8. For n ≥ 10, the proof that CnC¯n does not have an OLDOIND-set is given in the next theorem.
Theorem 3.9 For n ≥ 10, CnC¯n does not have an OLDOIND-set.
Proof. For a proof by contradiction, assume n ≥ 10 and that CnC¯n has an
OLDOIND-set S = S0 ∪ S¯1 such that S0 ⊆ V (Cn) and S¯1 ⊆ V (C¯n).
First we claim that no two vertices in V (Cn) \ S0 are adjacent in Cn, that is, if v ∈ V (Cn) \ S0, then |N (v) ∩S0| = 2. Suppose |N (v) ∩S0| ≤ 1. So, v has a neighbor in Cn, say u ∈ V (Cn) \S0. By Lemma 2.2, u and v must be open-dominated at least twice, which implies {u¯, v¯}⊂ S¯1. Since u¯ and v¯ must be open-dominated and they are not neighbors, u¯ has a neighbor in C¯n, say u¯j, that belongs to S¯1, also v¯ has a neighbor in C¯n, say v¯j, that belongs to S¯1. So |S1| ≥ 4 and this fact contradicts Proposition 3.6. Thus, we may conclude that |N (v) ∩ S0| = 2. This implies that S0 consists of either (i) n/3 components of order two (which is possible only if n
mod 3 = 0), or (ii) [n/3♩ components of order two and exactly one isolated vertex
(which is possible only if n mod 3 = 2.) From now on, we assume n mod 3 ∈ {0, 2}.

Reference to Figure 4 may aid the understanding of the following reasoning, where for C¯n, instead of indicating the edges, we indicate the non-edges by dashed lines. By Proposition 3.6, |S¯1| ∈ {2, 3}. If |S¯1| = 2, assume S¯1 = {v¯i, v¯j} for some integers i, j, 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n. In order to dominate all vertices in V (C¯n), i +3 ≤ j. If
|S¯1| = 3, then S¯1 = {v¯i, v¯i+1, v¯i+2}, for some integer i, 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 2.

Now let W = V (Cn) \ S0, let W¯
denote the corresponding vertices of W in

V (C¯n), and let W¯ j = W¯ \ S¯1. If n mod 3 = 0, we have that |S0| = 2n/3 and
|S¯1| = 2, and if n mod 3 = 2, then |S0| = 1 + (2n − 4)/3 and |S¯1| = 3. In both
cases, since n ≥ 10, |W¯ j| ≥ 2. Let v¯k, v¯l ∈ W¯ j for some integers k, l, 1 ≤ k < l ≤ n. Then, (N (v¯k) ∩ S) = (N (v¯l) ∩ S) = S¯1, implying that S is not an OLDOIND-set for CnC¯n.	2

Next we consider the path graph Pn,n ≥ 2.  We can easily check that the graph P2P¯2 does not have an OLDOIND-set and that OLDOIND(P3P¯3) = OLDOIND(P4P¯4) = 4, OLDOIND(P5P¯5) = OLDOIND(P6P¯6)
=  6, OLDOIND(P7P¯7)  =  OLDOIND(P8P¯8)  =  OLDOIND(P9P¯9)  =  8, and
OLDOIND(P10P¯10) = OLDOIND(P11P¯11) = 10. We prove in the next theorem that PnP¯n does not have an OLDOIND-set when n ≥ 12.
Theorem 3.10 For n ≥ 12, PnP¯n does not have an OLDOIND-set. (cf Proposition 3.2 of [13] concerning the existence of OLDOIND-sets in path graphs.)
Proof. As E(Pn)= E(Cn) \ {v1vn} and E(P¯n)= E(C¯n) ∪{v1vn}, the proof closely follows that of Theorem 3.9. The claim that no two vertices in V (Pn) \ S0 are adjacent in Pn mirrors that in Theorem 3.9 except when v = v1 or vn. Clearly, in these cases v must be open-dominated by its solitary neighbor in Pn and |N (v) ∩
S0| = 1, but the claim still holds. Following the notation and reasoning in Theorem 3.9, when n ≥ 12, |W| = |W¯ | ≥ 4. Since |W¯ j| ≥ 2 in all cases, the result follows. 2

Concluding remarks
A logarithmic lower bound on the size of an OLDOIND-set in any graph has been provided. Various properties of and bounds on OLDOIND-sets in complementary prisms were presented and the cases of cliques, paths and cycles have been com- pletely solved. It has been shown that for any graph with girth at least five, it can be decided in polynomial time whether or not its complementary prism has an OLD-OIND-set (and also the set can be found in polynomial time if it ex- ists). Furthermore, we conjecture that the problem of deciding if a graph has an OLDOIND-set remains NP-complete even for complementary prisms and pose the following open questions:

Which families of graphs attain the bounds of Theorem 3.4?
What are the additional conditions necessary to extend Theorem 2.1 for general graphs? and for complementary prisms?
