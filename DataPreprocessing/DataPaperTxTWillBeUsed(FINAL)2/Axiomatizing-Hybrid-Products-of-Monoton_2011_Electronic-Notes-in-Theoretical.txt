Abstract
The main aim of this paper is to propose a robust way to combine two monotone hybrid logics. This work can be regarded as a further extension of both topological semantics for hybrid logic (Ten Cate and Litak 2007) and bi-hybrid logic of products of Kripke frames (Sano 2010). First, we generalize the notion of product of topologies (Van Benthem, et al 2006) to the monotone neighborhood frames and introduce two kinds of nominals: i (e.g. for a moment of time) and a (e.g. for a spatial point), and the corresponding satisfaction operators: @i and @a to describe a product of monotone neighborhood frames. Second, we give five interaction axioms and establish a general completeness result called pure completeness of bi-hybrid logic of monotone neighborhood frames. By extending this, we also establish a pure completeness result of bi-hybrid logic of products of topologies.
Keywords: product of topologies, hybrid logic, product of neighborhood frames, monotone neighborhood frames, pure completeness.

Introduction
When we want to formalize the inference containing two dimensional information (e.g. space and time, time and the individual domain, etc.), we encounter with the following problem: how can we deal with two kinds of information in one setting? In other words, we need to know how to combine two modal logics, provided we deal with each of two dimensional (e.g. spatial and temporal) information in terms of modal logic. Product of modal logics should be counted as one answer to this question. It have been studied comprehensively since [5] (see also [4]), based on the notion of product of Kripke frames. Both dimension of a given two-dimensional structure, however, are not always relational. They might be topological. So, it would be desirable to combine not only two relational structures (i.e. Kripke frames) but also two topological structures. Van Benthem, et al. [18] generalized the notion of product of Kripke frames to the notion of product of topologies (see

also [15]). They proposed a way of combining two topological modal logics, based on topological semantics for modal logic studied by McKinsey and Tarski [11]. More- over, they showed that the fusion of two S4s is complete with respect to the product of two rational lines, while Kremer [8] showed that this fusion is incomplete with respect to the product of two real lines. Up to now, however, there is no study of the weaker notion of product of neighborhood frames (for neighborhood semantics of modal logic, the reader can refer to [3]).
Hybrid logic is an extended modal logic, which overcomes a weakness of expres- sive power of the basic modal logic over Kripke frames. For example, we can define the class of partial orders (the reflexive, antisymmeric and transitive relations) by nominals i and satisfaction operators @i, while this class is not definable by any set of ordinary modal formulas. Moreover, we can define the class of partial orders by pure formulas, i.e., formulas not containing any ordinary proposition letters. For example, the conjunction of @i3i, @i3j ∧ @j3i → @ij and @i3j ∧ @j3k → @i3k defines the class of partial orders. It is known that if a class F of Kripke frames is definable by a set of pure formulas, we can always obtain a strong completeness of the logic of F with respect to F [1]. Such result is called pure completeness. The author [13] extended the notion of product of modal logics to hybrid logics over Kripke semantics and established a pure completeness result for products of Kripke frames. He also showed that the product of any two pure complete logics enjoys a completeness result. In this sense, he expanded the range of combining logics without losing a completeness result.
The most significant feature of [13] is to propose the idea of naming lines by two kinds of nominals, instead of the ordinary idea of naming points in hybrid logic. This idea allows us to extend pure completeness result to two-dimensional Kripke semantics. In this paper, we keep this key feature also for two-dimensional neighborhood or topological semantics and see if it gives rise to the corresponding general completeness result. As a result, we will demonstrate that the idea of naming lines is robust for obtaining the completeness result.
To be more precise, this paper generalizes the method of [13] to both the product of monotone neighborhood frames and the product of topological spaces [18]. This study can also be regarded as a further extension of topological and monotone neighborhood semantics for hybrid logic studied by Ten Cate and Litak [17] and the author [14]. A main theorem of this paper is a pure completeness result for products of monotone neighborhood frames (Theorem 5.11). By extending it, we will also establish a pure completeness result for products of topological spaces (Theorem 5.14). As a corollary, we will show that any topo-product of two pure topo-complete logics enjoys a completeness result (Corollary 6.3). For example, this corollary tells us that we can provide a complete axiomatization of the logic (in two-dimensional hybrid language) of all products of dense-in-itself T1-spaces, since the condition of being of T1 are definable by a pure formula [6]. Finally, as a limitative result, we also show that this pure axiomatizable logic of all products of dense-in-itself T1-spaces is incomplete with respect to the product of real lines (Theorem 6.7).

Product of Monotone Neighborhood Frames
A topological space is a pair ⟨ T, O⟩ such that a set O ⊆ P(T ) of open sets is closed under arbitrary unions and arbitrary finite intersections. Unlike this ordinary definition, we adopt the definition of topological spaces in terms of local neighborhood basis at a point, since this formulation allows us to regard the notion of topological space as a special case of the notion of monotone neighborhood frames as follows.
Definition 2.1 We say that ⟨ T, τ ⟩ is a neighborhood frame if T /= ∅ and τ : T → PP(T ). A neighborhood frame ⟨ T, τ ⟩ is monotone if, for any x ∈ T ,
(supplementedness) X ∩ Y ∈ τ (x) implies X, Y ∈ τ (x).
⟨ T, τ ⟩ is normal if it is monotone and it satisfies: for any x ∈ T , (non-emptiness) τ (x) /= ∅.
(intersection) X, Y ∈ τ (x) implies X ∩ Y ∈ τ (x).
⟨ T, τ ⟩ is a topological space if it is normal and it satisfies: for any x ∈ T ,
(T) For all X ∈ τ (x), x ∈ X.
(4) For all X ∈ τ (x), { y ∈ T | X ∈ τ (y) }∈ τ (x).
Definition 2.2 Let T1 = ⟨ T1, τ1 ⟩ and T2 = ⟨ T2, τ2 ⟩ be monotone. We define the
product T1 ⊗ T2 = ⟨ T1 × T2, τh, τv ⟩ of T1 and T2 by:
τh(x, y)	= { P ⊆ T1 × T2 | ∃ X ∈ τ1(x).X ×{ y }⊆ P },
τv(x, y)	= { P ⊆ T1 × T2 | ∃ Y ∈ τ2(y). { x}× Y ⊆ P }.
We say that τh is a horizontal neighborhood structure on T1 × T2 and τv is a vertical neighborhood structure on T1 × T2. If T1 and T2 are topological spaces, we say that T1 ⊗ T2 is the product of topologies.
It is easy to see that τh and τv are monotone. Given two topological spaces T1 and T2, let us remark that T1 ⊗ T2 = ⟨ T1 × T2, τh, τv ⟩ does not coincide with the product topology ⟨ T1 × T2, τ1,2 ⟩ of T1 and T2, where τ1,2(x, y) is the ⊇-closure of { X × Y | X ∈ τ1(x) and Y ∈ τ2(y) }. However, we can regard, e.g., τh as the product topology of the topology determined by τ1 and the discrete topology on T2. By this view and the following proposition, we can state that our definition of product of topologies in terms of local neighborhood basis and Van Benthem, et al. [18]’s definition in terms of open sets, are the same.
Proposition 2.3 Let T1 = ⟨ T1, τ1 ⟩ and T2 = ⟨ T2, τ2 ⟩ be monotone. (i) If τ1 and τ2 are normal, then τh and τv are normal. (ii) If τ1 and τ2 are topological spaces, then τh and τv are also topological spaces.
Proof. (i) is easy. Let us show (ii). It suffices to check that (T) of τ1 implies
(T) of τh and that (4) of τ1 implies (4) of τh. We only show (4), since (T) is easy to show. Assume that τ1 satisfies (4) and that P ∈ τh(x, y). We need to establish that {⟨ xj, yj ⟩∈ T1 × T2 | P ∈ τh(xj, yj) } ∈ τh(x, y), i.e., there exists Z ∈

τ1(x) such that Z × { y } ⊆ { ⟨ xj, yj ⟩∈ T1 × T2 | P ∈ τh(xj, yj) }. By assumption, there exists X ∈ τ1(x) such that X ×{ y }⊆ P . Since τ1 satisfies (4) and X ∈ τ1(x),
{ xj ∈ T1 | X ∈ τ1(xj) }∈ τ1(x). Since X×{ y }⊆ P , { xj ∈ T1 | X ∈ τ1(xj) }×{ y }⊆ 
{⟨ xj, yj ⟩∈ T1 × T2 | P ∈ τh(xj, yj) }.	 

Hybrid Semantics on Product on Monotone Neigh- borhood Frames
Let us introduce the syntax. First of all, it is worth noting that our syntax has two disjoint sets NOM1 and NOM2 of nominals. E.g., one can consider that an element of NOM1 represents an instant of time and an element of NOM2 represents a coordinate of space. So, our vocabulary consists of:
two countable but disjoint sets of nominals NOM1 = { i, j, k,... } and NOM2
= { a, b, c, . . . },
a countable set PROP of propositional variables, where we assume that PROP
is disjoint from NOM1 ∪ NOM2,
Boolean connectives: ¬, ∧,
two modal operators:  1 (e.g. for time) and  2 (e.g. for space) (3α is the defined dual of α, where α = 1 or 2),
two kinds of satisfaction operators: @i (i ∈ NOM1), @a (a ∈ NOM2). Then, the set of formulas is defined inductively by:
ϕ ::= i | a | p | ¬ϕ| ϕ ∧ ψ |  1ϕ|  2ϕ| @iϕ| @aϕ.
We say that ϕ is pure if ϕ does not contain any propositional variables. For example, @i@a31(i ∧ 32a) is pure. If ϕ is constructed only from the vocabulary (ii), (iii) and (iv) above, we say that ϕ is a two-dimensional modal formula. Moreover, we define the following two sublanguages: L1 := { ¬, ∧, 1 } ∪ PROP ∪ NOM1 ∪
{ @i | i ∈ NOM1 } and L2 := { ¬, ∧, 2 } ∪ PROP ∪ NOM2 ∪ { @a | a ∈ NOM2 }. We say that ϕ is a Lα-formula if it is constructed from the vocabulary of Lα (α = 1, 2).
Let us provide the semantics to our syntax. Intuitively, we define our valuation so that the denotation of i ∈ NOM1 is a vertical line { x}×T2 and the denotation of a ∈ NOM2 is a horizontal line T1 ×{ y } over T1 ×T2. In this sense, we call i, j, k, ··· vertical nominals and a, b, c, ··· horizontal nominals below in this paper. So, let us define a valuation as follows. Given any product T1 ⊗ T2 of monotone neighborhood frames, we say that a mapping V : PROP ∪ NOM1 ∪ NOM2 → P(T1 × T2) is a valuation if (i) for any i ∈ NOM1, |π1[V (i)]| = 1 and π2[V (i)] = T2; (ii) for any a ∈ NOM2, |π2[V (a)]| = 1 and π1[V (a)] = T1, where πα : T1 × T2 → Tα is the projection onto Tα 1 2 . Note that the denotation of p is a subset of T1 × T2. Let

1 As for V (i), the condition π2[V (i)] = T2 excludes the possibility that V (i) isa non-empty proper subset
of { x }× T2.
2  Alternatively, we can also define V (i) := π−1[{ x }] for some x ∈ T1 and V (a) := π−1[{ y }] for some
1	2
y ∈ T2.

us denote a unique element of π1[V (i)] by iV and a unique element of π2[V (a)] by aV . Then, we can derive that V (i)= { iV }× T2 and V (a)= T1 ×{ aV }. We call a pair ⟨ T1 ⊗ T2,V ⟩ a monotone neighborhood product model (simply product model, when it causes no confusion).
Then, for any pair M = ⟨ T1 ⊗ T2,V ⟩, any ⟨ x, y ⟩ ∈ T1 × T2 and any ϕ, the
satisfaction relation H is defined inductively as follows:

where Jϕ) = {⟨ x, y ⟩| M, ⟨ x, y ⟩ H ϕ}. We usually write ⟨ x, y ⟩ H ϕ, when the underlying model M is clear from the context. By monotonicity of τh and τv, we can simplify the satisfactions of 1ϕ and 2ϕ as:

Remark that the behavior of @iϕ is different from one-dimensional hybrid logic. In one-dimensional semantics, if ϕ holds at the state named by i, then @iϕ holds at all states. In our two-dimensional semantics, (iV , y) ∈ Jϕ) does not imply J@iϕ)
= T1 × T2 in general.
We need more semantic definitions. A formula ϕ is valid ona product model M (notation: M H ϕ) if M, ⟨ x, y ⟩ H ϕ for any pair ⟨ x, y ⟩ in M. We say that ϕ is valid on T1 ⊗ T2 (notation: T1 ⊗ T2 H ϕ) if ⟨ T1 ⊗ T2,V ⟩ H ϕ for any valuation V . We also say that a set Λ of formulas is valid on T1 ⊗ T2 (notation: T1 ⊗ T2 H Λ) if T1 ⊗ T2 H ϕ for any ϕ ∈ Λ. A set Λ of formulas deﬁnes a class F of product of monotone neighborhood frames if, for any T1 ⊗ T2, T1 ⊗ T2 H Λ iff T1 ⊗ T2 ∈ F. A setΛ of formulas is satisﬁable in a class F of product of monotone neighborhood frames if there exists some T1 ⊗ T2 ∈ F and some valuation V on it and some pair
⟨ x, y ⟩ from T1 ⊗ T2 such that all formulas of Λ are true at ⟨ x, y ⟩ of ⟨ T1 ⊗ T2,V ⟩.


Proposition 3.1 All the formulas in Table 1 are valid on any product of monotone neighborhood frames.

Table 1
Interaction Axioms for Product of Monotone Neighborhood Frames

Proof. We only show the validity of Com  1@2. ⟨ x, y ⟩ H  1@ap iff :
∃ X ∈ τ1(x). ∀ xj ∈ X.⟨ xj,y ⟩ H @ap iff ∃ X ∈ τ1(x). ∀ xj ∈ X.⟨ xj, aV ⟩ H p
iff ⟨ x, aV ⟩ H  1p iff ⟨ x, y ⟩ H @a 1p, as desired.	 
The one-dimensional nature of the horizontal and vertical neighborhood frames is emphasized by the following proposition (cf. [18, Proposition 3.10]).
Proposition 3.2 (i) A L1-formula ϕ is valid on T1 ⊗ T2 iff ϕ is valid on T1.
(ii) A L2-formula ϕ is valid on T1 ⊗ T2 iff ϕ is valid on T2.
Proof. We can show these two items by the similar argument for product of Kripke frames [13, Proposition 2.2].	 

Monotone Hybrid Product Logic
Definition 4.1 A set Λ of formulas is a Name-logic if Λ contains all tautologies and Λ is closed under MP and Name in Table 2. Λ is a monotone bi-hybrid logic if Λ is a Name-logic and Λ contains K@, Selfdual, Ref , Intro, BMon, Agree in Table 2 and Λ is closed under Mon, Nec@, Sub in Table 2. A monotone bi-hybrid logic Λ is normal if it contains N and R.
One difference from the notion of bi-hybrid logic in [13] consists in the axiom BMon in Table 2. In [13], the author used the axiom Back: @np → α@np, where n ∈ NOMα (α = 1, 2). However, we cannot use it in this context, because @ip → 1@ip defines (non-emptiness) of τ1 [14]. On the other hand, it is easy to see that @ip ∧  1q →  1(@ip ∧ q) is valid on all monotone neighborhood frames
⟨ T1, τ1 ⟩. Another difference consists in whether we include the inference rule BG
from Table 2 in the definition. We will discuss this below.
In order to capture the interaction between two dimensions, however, we also need the five interaction axioms in Table 1.
Definition 4.2 A monotone bi-hybrid logic Λ is a monotone hybrid product logic if Λ contains all formulas: Com@, Com31@2, Com32@1, Red@1 and Red@2 in Ta- ble 1. We denote the smallest monotone hybrid product logic by (MName, MName).

We also say that a monotone hybrid product logic Λ is normal if Λ contains N and
R. Λ is a topological hybrid product logic if Λ is a normal hybrid product logic and it contains T and 4 in Table 2. We denote the smallest topological hybrid product logic by (S4Name, S4Name).

Let us go back to the inference rule BG.
Definition 4.3 A monotone ⟨ T, τ ⟩ is augmented if  τ (x) ∈ τ (x) for any x ∈ T , i.e., τ (x) has a smallest element. A topological space ⟨ T, τ ⟩ is Alexandrov if ⟨ T, τ ⟩ is augmented.
For one-dimensional hybrid logic, Ten Cate and Litak [17] showed that BG-rule characterizes the class of all Alexandrov spaces, and they also generalized it to a characterization of the class of all augmented monotone neighborhood frames by BG. We will discuss now how to extend their results in the context of the present paper (for a similar kind of characterization by BG in a different context, see [12]). Given two valuations V and V j and a horizontal or vertical nominal m, we say that V j is an m-variant of V if V and V j agree on all elements from the domain except possibly for m. Let us say that T1 ⊗ T2 admits BG for  α if any valuation
V on T1 ⊗ T2 falsifying the consequent @n αϕ can be changed to some valuation V j such that it falsifies the antecedent @n3αm → @mϕ and V j is an m-variant of V .
Proposition 4.4 If a monotone T1 is augmented, then T1 ⊗ T2 admits BG for  1
for any monotone T2.
Proof. Assume that a monotone T1 is augmented and that V on T1 ⊗ T2 falsifies @i 1ϕ. Then, we can find some ⟨ x, y ⟩ such that x = iV and ⟨ x, y ⟩ /H 1ϕ. By augmentation of τ1, it follows that we can choose xj ∈  τ1(x) such that ⟨ xj,y ⟩ ∈/ Jϕ)V . Let us consider some j-variant V j of V such that V j(j) := { xj }× T2 (recall that j is fresh in @i 1ϕ). Then, it is easy to see that @i31j → @jϕ is false at
⟨ x, y ⟩ under V j.	 
Proposition 4.5 If a monotone T1 is not augmented, T1 ⊗ T1 fails to admit BG
for  1.
Proof. The proof is similar to [17, Theorem 3.4]. It suffices to care about the vertical dimension. Assume that a monotone T1 is not augmented. Thus, τ1(x) has no smallest element for some x ∈ T1.  Fix such x.  Then, it follows that
{ xj ∈ X | ∃ Xj ∈ τ1(x). xj ∈/ Xj } /= ∅ for any X ∈ τ1(x). By the axiom of choice, we can find a sequence (g(X))X∈τ1(x) such that (0) g(X) ∈ X, (1) ∀ X ∈ τ1(x).X ∩
{ g(X) | X ∈ τ1(x) } /= ∅, and (2) ∀ X ∈ τ1(x). ∃ Xj ∈ τ1(x). g(X) ∈/ Xj. Define V (i)
= { x}× T1 and V (p) = (T1 \{ g(X) | X ∈ τ1(x) }) × T1. By (1), we can establish
⟨ x, x⟩ ∈/ J@i 1p)V . Consider any j-variant V j of V . We show that @i31j → @jp is true at all points ⟨ x1, x2 ⟩ from T1 × T1 under V j. By definition of (g(X))X∈τ (x) and (2), it is easy to see that ⟨ x1, x2 ⟩ ∈/ J@jp)V ′ implies ⟨ x1, x2 ⟩ ∈/ J@i31j)V ′ . 
Corollary 4.6 Let T1 be monotone. Then, the following are equivalent:

T1 is augmented.
T1 ⊗ T2 admits BG for  1 for any monotone T2.
T1 ⊗ T1 admits BG for  1.
Proof. By Propositions 4.4 and 4.5.	 
If we restrict our attention to the product of topologies, Van Benthem, et al [18] showed equivalence of several characterizations of Alexandrovness in terms of com→, com→ and chr from Table 2. So, we can combine these characterizations with ours and obtain the following.
Corollary 4.7 Let T1 be a topological space. Then, the following are equivalent:
T1 is Alexandrov.
T1 ⊗ T2 admits BG for  1 for any topological space T2.
T1 ⊗ T1 admits BG for  1.
T1 ⊗ T1 H com→ ∧ com→.
T1 ⊗ T2 H com→ for any topological space T2.
T2 ⊗ T1 H com→ for any topological space T2.
T1 ⊗ T1 H chr.
Proof. By Corollary 4.6 and [18, Corollary 4.19 and Corollary 4.22].	 
Remark 4.8 A natural question to ask is whether we can generalize the above characterization taken from [18] to monotone neighborhood frames. This is not the case. The proof for (i) ⇒ ((v) & (vi)) and (i) ⇒ (vii) in Corollary 4.7 can go through even for monotone neighborhood frames (cf. [18, Propositions 4.15 and 4.20]). Their proof of (iv) ⇒ (i), however, requires (non-emptiness) and (intersec- tion) of ⟨ T, τ ⟩ (cf. [18, Propositions 4.18]). Moreover, the following tells us that the above generalization is impossible.
Proposition 4.9 There is a non-augmented monotone T = ⟨ T, τ ⟩ such that T ⊗
T |= com→ ∧ com→.
Proof. Fix some non-empty T . Define τ : T → PP(T ) by τ (x)= ∅ for any x ∈ T .
Then, (T, τ ) is not augmented, since T τ (x) = T ∈/ τ (x). Fix any ⟨ x, y ⟩ ∈ T × T
and any valuation V . Since both τ (x) and τ (y) are empty, we trivially have ⟨ x, y ⟩ ∈/
J 1 2p)V and ⟨ x, y ⟩ ∈/ J 2 1p)V , as desired.	 

Pure Completeness for Product of Monotone Frames
Definition 5.1 Let Λ be a Name-logic. ϕ is deducible in Λ from Γ if there is a finite subset Γj of Γ such that Γj → ϕ ∈ Λ, where Γj is the conjunction of all finite elements of Γj (if Γj = ∅, we define Γj := T ). Γ is Λ-consistent if ⊥ is not deducible from Γ in Λ.

Lemma 5.2 The following derivation rules are admissible in all monotone bi- hybrid logic:
If ▶ @j(ϕ → ψ) and j is fresh in ϕ → ψ, then ▶ @i( 1ϕ →  1ψ).
If ▶ α → @j(ϕ → ψ) and j is fresh in α and ϕ → ψ, then ▶ α → (@i 1ϕ →
@i 1ψ).
If ▶ @b(ϕ → ψ) and b is fresh in ϕ → ψ, then ▶ @a( 2ϕ →  2ψ).
If ▶ α → @b(ϕ → ψ) and b is fresh in α and ϕ → ψ, then ▶ α → (@a 2ϕ →
@a 2ψ).
Proof. It suffices to show (i) and (ii). Let us show (i). Assume that ▶ @j(ϕ → ψ) and that j is fresh in ϕ → ψ. First of all, remark that we can always use distributivity of @ over Boolean connectives from our axioms for @. Then, we can derive from Intro that @j(ϕ → ψ) → (j → (ϕ → ψ)). By this and our assumption, we obtain ▶ j → (ϕ → ψ). We deduce from Name and the freshness assumption of j that ▶ ϕ → ψ. It follows from Mon that ▶ 1ϕ → 1ψ. By Nec@, we obtain @i( 1ϕ →  1ψ), as required. Next, we show (ii). Assume that j is fresh in α and ϕ → ψ and that ▶ α → @j(ϕ → ψ), i.e., ▶ (α ∧ @jϕ) → @jψ. Let us choose k such that k does not occur in α → (@i 1ϕ → @i 1ψ) and k /= j. By Nec@, ▶ @k((α ∧ @jϕ) → @jψ). We obtain ▶ @j((@kα ∧ ϕ) → ψ) by Agree and distributivity of @ over Boolean connectives. It follows from (i) that
▶ @i( 1(@kα ∧ ϕ) →  1ψ), since j does not occur in (@kα ∧ ϕ) → ψ. By BMon,
▶ @i((@kα ∧ 1ϕ) → 1ψ). It follows from the similar argument by Agree to the above that ▶ @k((α ∧ @i ϕ) → @i ψ), i.e., ▶ @k(α → (@i 1ϕ → @i 1ψ)). By Name, we conclude ▶ α → (@i 1ϕ → @i 1ψ).	 
Definition 5.3 Let Δ be any set of formulas.
Δ is labelled if i ∧ a ∈ Δ for some ⟨ i, a ⟩.
Δ is monotonically  1-saturated if, for every ¬(@i 1ϕ → @i 1@aψ) ∈ Δ, there is a vertical nominal j which does not appear in ϕ and ψ such that ¬@j(ϕ → @aψ) ∈ Δ.
Δ is monotonically  2-saturated if, for every ¬(@a 2ϕ → @a 2@iψ) ∈ Δ, there is a horizontal nominal b which does not appear in ϕ and ψ such that ¬@b(ϕ → @iψ) ∈ Δ.
The following is immediate from Definition 5.3.
Lemma 5.4 Let Λ be a monotone hybrid product logic. Suppose that Δ is mono- tonically  α-saturated Λ-MCS (α = 1, 2).
If @j(ϕ → @aψ) ∈ Δ for all vertical nominals j, then @j  1ϕ → @j  1@aψ ∈ Δ
for all vertical nominals j.
If @b(ϕ → @iψ) ∈ Δ for all horizontal nominals b, then @b 2ϕ → @b 2@iψ ∈
Δ for all horizontal nominals b.
Lemma 5.5 (Lindenbaum Lemma) Let Λ be a monotone hybrid product logic.

Every Λ-consistent set of formulas can be extended to a labelled, monotonically 1- saturated and monotonically 2-saturated Λ-MCS, by adding both countably many new horizontal nominals and countably many new vertical nominals to the language.
Proof. Suppose that Σ is Λ-consistent (henceforth ‘consistent’). Let (in)n∈ω and (an)n∈ω be two disjoint sets of countable fresh nominals. Let also (ϕn)n∈ω be an enumeration of all formulas in this expanded syntax. We are going to construct a sequence of consistent extensions (Σn)n∈ω of Σ by induction on n.
(Basis) Define Σ0 := Σ∪{ i0 ∧ a0 }. By two kinds of Name-rule, we easily establish that Σ0 is consistent.
(Inductive Step) Suppose that Σn is consistent. Let us define Σn+1 as follows: If Σn ∪{ ϕn } is inconsistent, Σn+1 := Σn. Otherwise, Σn+1 is defined by:
⎧⎪⎨Σn ∪{ ϕn, ¬@j(ϕ → @aψ) }	if ϕn ≡ ¬(@i  1ϕ → @i  1@aψ)

Σn+1 :=
Σn ∪{ ϕn, ¬@b(ϕ → @iψ) }	if ϕn ≡ ¬(@a 2ϕ → @a 2@iψ)
⎪⎩Σn ∪{ ϕn }	o.w.

where b ∈ { an }n∈ω and j ∈ { in }n∈ω are ﬁrst unused vertical and horizontal nominals in Σn ∪{ ϕn }, respectively.
Claim 5.6 Σn+1 is consistent.
Proof of Claim. It suffices to check the case where Σn ∪{ ϕn } is consistent and ϕn ≡ ¬(@i 1ϕ → @i 1@aψ). Recall that j is fresh in Σn ∪{ ϕn }. Assume for the purpose of reductio that Σn+1 is inconsistent. Then there exist γ1,..., γn ∈ Σn such that ▶ ϕn ∧ ¬@j(ϕ → @aψ) → ¬ l γl. Let us put η:= l γl. It follows from propositional logic that ▶ ϕn ∧ η → @j(ϕ → @aψ). By Lemma 5.2 (ii) and the choice of j, we obtain ▶ ϕn ∧ η → (@i 1ϕ → @i 1@aψ), which is equivalent to
▶ ¬(ϕn ∧ η) by ϕn ≡ ¬(@i 1ϕ → @i 1@aψ). This tells us the inconsistency of Σn ∪{ ϕn }. A contradiction.	E
Finally, we put Σω:= n∈ω Σn. Then, by construction we can easily establish that Σω is a labelled, monotonically 1- and 2-saturated MCS.	 
Let us now define the notion of a Henkin-style product model.
Definition 5.7 Let Λ be a monotone hybrid product logic. Given any Λ-MCS Δ, we define a Henkin-style product model MΔ = ⟨ T1 ⊗ T2, VΔ ⟩ where Tα := ⟨ Tα, τα ⟩ (α = 1, 2), as follows:
For any vertical nominal i and any horizontal nominal a, let us define: [i] :=
{ j | @ij ∈ Δ }, |a| := { b | @ab ∈ Δ }.
Define T1 := { [i] | i : vertical nominal } and T2 := { |a|| a : horizontal nominal }.
We also define τ1 : T1 → PP(T1) and τ1 : T2 → PP(T2) as follows:
X ∈ τ1([i]) iff ∃ θ. (@i 1θ ∈ Δ and ∀ k. (@kθ ∈ Δ implies [k] ∈ X)), Y ∈ τ2(|a|) iff ∃ θ. (@a 2θ ∈ Δ and ∀ c. (@cθ ∈ Δ implies |c|∈ Y )).

Define the mapping VΔ by: VΔ(l) = {⟨ [j], |b|⟩| @j@bl ∈ Δ } for any l ∈ PROP ∪
NOM1 ∪ NOM2.
It is clear that τ1 and τ2 are monotone: Let us check that τ1 is monotone. Assume that X ∈ τ1([i]) and X ⊆ Y . By definition, there exists some θ such that @i 1θ ∈ Δ and ∀ k. (@kθ ∈ Δ implies [k] ∈ X)). Since X ⊆ Y , we have
∀ k. (@kθ ∈ Δ implies [k] ∈ Y )). Then, we can conclude that Y ∈ τ1([i]).
Lemma 5.8 (Truth Lemma) Let Λ be a monotone hybrid product logic. For all monotonically  1- and  2-saturated Λ-MCSs Δ, all pairs ⟨ i, a ⟩ and all formulas ϕ, MΔ, ⟨ [i], |a|⟩ H ϕ iff @i@aϕ ∈ Δ.
Proof. First, we check that VΔ is really a valuation. In order to show that, it suffices to show that VΔ(i) := { [j] | @ij ∈ Δ }× T2 and that { [j] | @ij ∈ Δ } is a singleton. We can establish the first clause, since VΔ(i) = {⟨ [j], |b|⟩| @j@bi ∈ Γ } and ▶ @j@bi ↔ @ji (by Nec@ and Red@2) and ▶ @ji ↔ @ij. As for the second clause, it suffices to note that we have ▶ @ii and ▶ @ij ∧ @jk → @ik.
Second, we prove our main statement by induction on ϕ. We only demonstrate it for the following case: ϕ is of the form 2ψ. The proofs for the cases: (a) ϕ is of the form j and (b) ϕ is of the form @jϕ, are the same as in the proof of [13, Lemma 3.11].
We can demonstrate the case where ϕ is of the form  2ψ as follows:
MΔ, ⟨ [i], |a|⟩ H  2ψ
iff ∃ Y ∈ τ2(|a|). ∀ y ∈ Y. ⟨ [i],y ⟩ H ψ
iff ∃ θ. (@a 2θ ∈ Δ and ∀ c. (@cθ ∈ Δ implies |c|∈ Y ) and ∀ y ∈ Y. ⟨ [i],y ⟩ H ψ) iff ∃ θ. (@a 2θ ∈ Δ and ∀ c. (@cθ ∈ Δ implies ⟨ [i], |c|⟩ ∈ Jψ)))
iff ∃ θ. (@a 2θ ∈ Δ and ∀ c. (@cθ ∈ Δ implies @i@cψ ∈ Δ)) iff @i@a 2ψ ∈ Δ
As for the right-to-left direction of the last equivalence, take @iψ as θ. Then, by Com@ and Com 2@1, we can establish the desired statement. As for the left-to- right direction, let us fix our witness θ. By Lemma 5.4 (monotone  2-saturation), we obtain @a 2@iψ ∈ Δ. By Com@ and Com 2@1, we establish @i@a 2ψ ∈ Δ, as required.	 
Definition 5.9 M = ⟨ T1 ⊗ T2,V ⟩ is named if, for any ⟨ x, y ⟩ in M, there exists
⟨ i, a ⟩ such that x = iV and y = aV .
Then, we can easily establish the following (cf. [1, Lemma 7.22]).
Lemma 5.10 Given any named product model M = ⟨ T1 ⊗ T2,V ⟩ and any pure formula ϕ, if M H σ(ϕ) for all uniform substitutions σ, then T1 ⊗ T2 H ϕ.
This lemma tells us that the notion of uniform substitution (Sub in Table 2) fits well with a named model also in monotone hybrid product logic.

Theorem 5.11 Let Γ be a set of pure formulas and Λ the smallest monotone hybrid product logic containing Γ. Then, Λ is sound and strongly complete for the class of all products of monotone neighborhood frames deﬁned by Γ.
Proof. Soundness is straightforward. In order to establish the strong completeness, assume that Δ is Λ-consistent. By Lemma 5.5, there exists a labelled, monotonically
 1- and 2-saturated MCS Δ+ such that Δ ⊆ Δ+. Construct the Henkin-style product model MΔ+ = ⟨ T1 ⊗ T2, VΔ+ ⟩. Since Δ+ is labelled, i ∧ a ∈ Δ+ for some pair ⟨ i, a ⟩. By Intro and i ∧ a ∈ Δ+, @i@aϕ ∈ Δ+ holds for any ϕ ∈ Δ+. So, we derive from Lemma 5.8 that Δ is satisfiable in MΔ+ . Finally, we show that T1 ⊗ T2 belongs to the class F of product frames defined by Γ. For any γ ∈ Γ, we have MΔ+ H σ(γ) for all uniform substitutions σ. So, T1 ⊗ T2 H Γ by Lemma 5.10. 
Corollary 5.12 (MName, MName) is sound and strongly complete for the class of
H(@)	H(@)
all product of monotone neighborhood frames.
Theorem 5.13 Let Γ be a set of pure formulas. The smallest normal hybrid product logic Λ containing Γ is sound and strongly complete for the class of all product of normal neighborhood frames deﬁned by Γ.
Proof. Soundness is straightforward. As for strong completeness, it suffices to show that Tα (α = 1, 2) satisfies (non-emptiness) and (intersection) in the Henkin-style product model MΔ+ = ⟨ T1 ⊗ T2, VΔ+ ⟩ (recall the proof of Theorem 5.11). We can easily establish (non-emptiness), because the axiom N is pure and N:  1T and
 2T define (non-emptiness) of τ1 and τ2, respectively. Let us establish that τ1 and τ2 satisfy (intersection) by the axiom R. Consider X, Xj ∈ τ1([i]). We demonstrate X ∩ Xj ∈ τ1([i]). Thus,

∃ θX. (@i 1θX ∈ Δ and ∀ k. (@kθX ∈ Δ implies [k] ∈ X)),
∃ θX′ . (@i 1θX′ ∈ Δ and ∀ k. (@kθX′ ∈ Δ implies [k] ∈ Xj)).

Then, we have @i 1θX ∧ @i 1θX′ ∈ Δ. By R for  1, @i 1(θX ∧ θX′ ) ∈ Δ. It is easy to see that ∀ k. (@k(θX ∧ θX′ ) ∈ Δ implies [k] ∈ X ∩ Xj)).	 
Theorem 5.14 Let Γ be a set of pure formulas. The smallest topological hybrid product logic Λ containing Γ is sound and strongly complete for the class of all product of topological spaces deﬁned by Γ.
Proof. We only show the strong completeness. It suffices to show that Tα (α = 1, 2) satisfies the conditions: (T) and (4) in the Henkin-style product model MΔ+ =
⟨ T1 ⊗ T2, VΔ+ ⟩ (recall the proof of Theorem 5.11 and Theorem 5.13). First, let us establish (T) of τ1. Assume X ∈ τ1([i]). We show that [i] ∈ X. This means that:
@i 1θX ∈ Δ and ∀ k. (@kθX ∈ Δ implies [k] ∈ X).
for some θX . By T-axiom, we have @iθX ∈ Δ. Then, we obtain [i] ∈ X, as required. Second, let us establish (4) of τ1. Assume X ∈ τ1([i]). We show { [j] | X ∈ τ1([j]) }∈ 

τ1([i]). Similarly to the argument for (T), we can find θX such that @i 1θX ∈ Δ and ∀ k. (@kθX ∈ Δ implies [k] ∈ X). By 4-axiom, we have @i 1 1θX ∈ Δ. For the witness of { [j] | X ∈ τ1([j]) } ∈ τ1([i]), let us consider 1θX . Then, it suffices to check that: ∀ k. (@k 1θX ∈ Δ implies X ∈ τ1([k])). Consider any k with @k 1θX ∈ Δ. Our witness for X ∈ τ1([k]) should be θX . Then, it suffices to check that:
∀ k . @k′ θX ∈ Δ implies [k ] ∈ X.
However, this is trivial.	 
Corollary 5.15 (S4Name, S4Name) is sound and strongly complete for the class of
H(@)	H(@)
all product of topological spaces.
An Application of Topological Pure Completeness
Definition 6.1 Let T = ⟨ T, τ ⟩ be a topological space.
T is a T0-space if, for any x, y ∈ T , x /= y implies that there exists X ⊆ T such that (y ∈/ X and X ∈ τ (x)) or (x ∈/ X and X ∈ τ (y)).
T is a T1-space if for any x, y ∈ T , x /= y implies that there exist X ∈ τ (x) and
Y ∈ τ (y) such that y ∈/ X and x ∈/ Y .
T is dense-in-itself if { x} ∈/ τ (x) for any x ∈ T .
Fact 6.2 (Gabelaia [6] (cf. [16])) With respect the class of all topological spaces, we have:
Sep0 for  1 in Table 2 deﬁnes the class of all T0-spaces.
Sep1 for  1 in Table 2 deﬁnes the class of all T1-spaces.
Di for  1 in Table 2 deﬁnes the class of all dense-in-itself spaces.
Remark that all the formulas in Fact 6.2 are pure.
Let us consider the one-dimensional hybrid language Lα. We say that a set Λ of Lα-formulas is a (one-dimensional) topological hybrid logic if it contains all axioms of Lα in monotone bi-hybrid logic as well as N, R, T and 4 and is closed under MP, Mon, Nec@, the uniform substitution Sub, Name for Lα (remark that we do not require the closure under BG). A topological hybrid logic Λ of Lα-formulas is topologically complete if there exists a class F of topological spaces such that Λ is the logic of F, i.e., Λ = { ϕ of Lα | ϕ is valid on F }. We also say that Λ is pure topo-complete if there exists a class F of topological spaces such that Λ is the logic of F and F is definable by some set of pure formulas in Lα. Let Λα be a topologically complete logic in Lα (α = 1, 2). The topo-product logic Λ1 ×t Λ2 is defined as the set of all valid formulas (of two-dimensional hybrid language) on any product T1 ⊗ T2 such that Λα is valid on Tα (α = 1, 2). We define (Λ1, Λ2) as the smallest topological hybrid product logic containing both Λ1 and Λ2.
Corollary 6.3 Let Λα be a pure topo-complete logic of Lα (α = 1, 2). Then:
(Λ1, Λ2)= Λ1 ×t Λ2.

Proof. By Theorem 5.14 and Proposition 3.2.	 
Let denote the smallest topological hybrid product logic containing Sep1 and Di
by (S4T1DiName, S4T1DiName). Then, this corollary and Fact 6.2 assure us that
H(@)	H(@)
(S4T1DiName, S4T1DiName) is strongly complete with respect to all products of
H(@)	H(@)
two dense-in-itself T1-spaces.
Since R with the Euclidean topology (i.e., the real line) satisfies T1 and density- in-itself, it is tempting to think that (S4T1DiName, S4T1DiName) is (weakly) com-
H(@)	H(@)
plete with respect to R ⊗ R, in the sense that ϕ ∈ (S4T1DiName, S4T1DiName)
H(@)	H(@)
iff R ⊗ R H ϕ, for any ϕ. In what follows in this section, we show that this is not
the case. Let us recall that a two-dimensional modal formula is a formula does not contain any hybrid vocabulary. We define the set S4 ⊕ S4 (usually called fusion) of two-dimensional modal formulas as the smallest normal bimodal logic containing S4-axioms for both  1 and  2. Below, let Q be the rational line.
Fact 6.4 (Van Benthem, et al [18]) Then, S4 ⊕ S4 is complete with respect to
Q ⊗ Q, i.e., ϕ ∈ S4 ⊕ S4 iff Q ⊗ Q H ϕ for any two dimensional modal formula ϕ.
Lemma 6.5 (S4T1DiName, S4T1DiName) is conservative over S4 ⊕ S4, i.e., for
H(@)	H(@)
any two dimensional modal formula ϕ, ϕ ∈ (S4T1DiName, S4T1DiName) implies

ϕ ∈ S4 ⊕ S4.
H(@)
H(@)

Proof. We show the contrapositive implication. Suppose that ϕ ∈/ S4 ⊗ S4. We deduce from Fact 6.4 that Q ⊗ Q /H ϕ. Remark that the rational line Q satisfies T1 and density-in-itself. Then, it is easy to see that (S4T1DiName, S4T1DiName) is

sound with respect to Q ⊗ Q, i.e.,
H(@)
H(@)

ψ ∈ (S4T1DiName, S4T1DiName) implies Q ⊗ Q H ψ
H(@)	H(@)
for any (two dimensional hybrid) formula ψ. Therefore, it follows from Q ⊗ Q /H ϕ
that ϕ ∈/ (S4T1DiName, S4T1DiName).	 
H(@)	H(@)
Fact 6.6 (Kremer [8]) S4 ⊕ S4 is incomplete with respect to R ⊗ R, i.e., there exists some two dimensional modal formula ϕ such that ϕ /∈ S4⊕S4 and R⊗R H ϕ.
Theorem 6.7 (S4T1DiName, S4T1DiName) is incomplete with respect to R ⊗ R,
H(@)	H(@)
i.e., there exists some formula ϕ such that ϕ /∈ (S4T1DiName, S4T1DiName) and

R ⊗ R H ϕ.
H(@)
H(@)

Proof. By Fact 6.6 and Lemma 6.5.	 

Further Directions and Open Problems
Local Deﬁnability
In the same sprit as did in [17], we can also include the downarrow binders in our syntax. The downarrow binder ↓ i (or ↓ a) binds a nominal i (or a) to the first (or,

second, respectively) argument of the current state. Given any ⟨ T1 × T2, τh, τv,V ⟩, we can define
⟨ T1 × T2, τh, τv,V ⟩, ⟨ x, y ⟩ H↓ i. ϕ iff ⟨ T1 × T2, τh, τv,V [i '→ x] ⟩, ⟨ x, y ⟩ H ϕ,
where V [i '→ x] is the i-variant of V such that it sends i to { x}× T2. We can also give the similar clause to ↓ a. ϕ. A technique of local deﬁnability allows us to capture this semantics by the axiom DA1: @j(↓ i. ϕ ↔ ϕ[i/j]), where ϕ[i/j] is the result of replacing all free instances of i by j in ϕ. We can also consider the corresponding axiom DA2 for ↓ a. ϕ. By the similar argument to [2, Theorem 5], we can immediately transfer Theorems 5.11, 5.13, and 5.14 to the syntax extended with the downarrow binders ↓ i and/or ↓ a.
Dependant Product of Monotone Neighborhood Frames
In [13], the author considered the dependence of the horizontal dimension to the vertical dimension by the notion of dependent product of Kripke frames and revealed that we still retain pure completeness result. It would be interesting to see if we can obtain the corresponding result for the notion of dependant product of monotone neighborhood frames.
Hybrid Product Logic over Product of Euclidean spaces
Theorem 6.7 established the incompleteness of (S4T1DiName, S4T1DiName) with
H(@)	H(@)
respect to R⊗R. In this stage, the author does not know if we can obtain a complete
axiomatization of the logic of R ⊗ R in our two-dimensional hybrid syntax. If the syntax for one-dimensional hybrid logic is expanded with the global modality Eϕ (read: ‘ϕ holds at some states’), the logic of the real line R in this syntax is not ﬁnite axiomatizable [9] (via Gargov-Goranko translation [7], see also [10]). However, Kudinov [9] also showed that the logic of Rn (n ≥ 2 is fixed) in the above syntax with the global modality is axiomatizable. Therefore, it would be interesting to study whether the hybrid product logic of Rn ⊗ Rn (n ≥ 2 is fixed) is axiomatizable or not.
