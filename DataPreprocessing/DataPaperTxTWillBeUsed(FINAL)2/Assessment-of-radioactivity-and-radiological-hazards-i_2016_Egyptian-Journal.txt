Gamma ray spectrometry Gonad
The activity concentrations of the natural radionuclides (40K, 232Th and 238U) in ceramic tiles use in homes and offices in Ile-Ife were investigated using a NaI (Tl) detector as the de- tecting device for gamma spectrometry. The gamma absorbed dose rate (DR), radium equivalent activity (Raeq), annual effective dose (Ad), activity concentration index (I), external radia- tion index (Hex), internal radiation hazard index (Hin), alpha index (Iα), activity concentration
index (Iγ), excess lifetime cancer risk (EC), and annual gonadal dose equivalent (AGd) asso-
ciated with the radionuclides were evaluated in order to assess the radiation hazard of ceramic tiles used in Ile-Ife. The mean activity concentrations of 850, 24, and 128 Bqkg−1 were ob- tained for 40K, 232Th, and 238U, respectively. These resulted in an annual effective dose that ranged from 0.07 to 0.2 mSvy−1 with a mean value of 0.14 mSvy−1. The results showed that all the calculated radiological parameters are within the recommended safety limit, hence,
do not pose significant radiological hazard when used as building materials.
In order to determine the similarities and correlations among various samples, all the radiological variables above were subjected to correlation analysis.

Introduction

Ceramic tiles are derived from a mixture of clay, sand, and other natural materials that are shaped into slabs and fired
at high temperatures, up to 1250 °C. A glaze surface layer is commonly applied. The glaze is essentially a glass covering, usually a mixture of raw materials such as zinc oxide, feldspar, kaolin, and zircon an opacifier dispersed in water. Their composition is the same as that of all ceramic

materials, from tableware and sanitary ware to roofing tiles [1,2].
Ceramic tiles are generally preferred for indoor finishing due to their ornamental properties along with their relatively cheap cost. Ceramic tiles may be glazed or unglazed. Zircon is a common opacifying constituent of glazes applied to ceramic tiles and is also used as an opacifier in porcelain tiles by in- corporating it directly into the mixture used for forming the body of the tile. All zircon sand contains radionuclides of natural origin, primarily those in the uranium and thorium decay series. Although the concentrations of these radionuclides are low, they are significantly higher than those in normal rocks and soil. Due to the presence of zircon in the glaze, ceramic tiles can show elevated concentration of natural radioactivity [1,3,4]. The fact that ceramic tiles are fundamentally building mate- rials, an assessment of their radiological impact on members of the public is necessary with emphasis on gamma radia- tion and inhalation of radon released from the product as the main exposure pathways [1].
Ceramic tiles have been extensively used in Nigeria as build- ing materials. The knowledge of the level of natural radioactivity in ceramic tiles as building material is of great importance to determine the associated radiological hazards to human health and to develop a reference data of radiological parameters in ceramic tiles used in Ile-Ife.
Several studies have been done on building materials in Nigeria [5,6]. However, there are few works on ceramic tiles in Nigeria. In Ekiti State, Nigeria, the mean activity concentra- tions measured in ceramic tiles for 226Ra, 232Th, and 40K were
74 ± 31, 82 ± 24, and 618 ± 231 Bq kg−1, respectively [7]. Jwanbot
et al. [8] assessed the indoor and outdoor gamma dose rate as- sociated with commercial building materials in Jos, Plateau Nigeria. For floor tiles, they reported an effective dose range of 0.258–0.264 mSv/yr and 0.218–0.226 mSv/yr for indoor and outdoor, respectively. These values were far below the recom- mended safe limit set by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP).
In this work, gamma-ray spectrometry was used to measure the activity concentrations of natural radionuclides in seven varieties of ceramic tiles that are used as flooring materials in Ile-Ife, Osun State Nigeria. Their associated radiological hazards were assessed by calculating the absorbed dose rate, radium equivalent activity, and the external and internal hazard indices. The possibility of the activity concentration associ- ated with ceramic tiles to elicit anomalous response from body tissues was assessed by determining the corresponding Gonadal dose equivalent as well as the excess lifetime cancer risk.


Materials and methods

Sample collection and preparation

A total of 7 different varieties of tiles were collected from the dealers in Ile-Ife based on their type and place of origin. The sample preparation was carried out in Centre for Energy Re- search and Development (CERD). Each of the samples with a mass of 200 g was weighed into cylindrical polyvinylchloride (PVC) containers, hermetically sealed and kept for 28 days in order to attain secular equilibrium between the parent and the daughter nuclides present.

Gamma ray spectroscopic technique

The activity concentration of natural radioactivity in the se- lected samples were determined using a 7.62 cm × 7.62 cm NaI (Tl) detector surrounded with adequate lead shielding that reduces the background by a factor of approximately 95%. A counting time of 25,200 s was used. The activities of various radionuclides were determined in Bq kg−1 from the count spectra obtained from each of the samples using the gamma ray photo peaks corresponding to energy of 1120.3 keV (214Bi), 911.21 keV (228Ac) and 1460.82 keV (40K) for 238U, 232Th and 40K, respec- tively. For a counting time of 25,200 s, the detection limits of the NaI (Tl) detector system were calculated as 6.77, 11.40, and
12.85 Bq kg−1 for 40K, 232Th, and 238U, respectively.

Results and discussion

Activity concentrations of 238U, 232Th, and 40K

The specific activity concentration of 232Th, 238U, and 40K in the samples is presented in Table 1. As can be seen in Table 1, the activity concentration of 40K ranged from 58 to 1768 Bq kg−1 while a range of 16 to 43 Bq kg−1 and 84 to 168 Bq kg−1 were ob- served for 238U and 232Th, respectively.
Besides the mean values of 238U, the mean values of 232Th and 40K are higher than the worldwide average values of 35, 30, and 400 Bq kg−1 for 232Th, 238U, and 40K, respectively [9]. As
shown in Table 1, the distribution of the activity concentra-
tion in the samples is not uniform; this is likely due to their region of origin and processing composition. The higher ac- tivity concentrations found in the studied ceramic tiles may be due to the presence of zircon in the glaze [1,10].








Absorbed gamma dose rate (DR) and the associated annual effective dose (Ad)

The data and formulas provided by the United Nations Sci- entific Committee on Effect of Atomic Radiation [9] and the European Commission [11] were used to determine the absorbed dose rate (DR) and the associated annual effective dose (Ad) due to gamma ray emission from the studied ceramic tiles.
In order to convert the activity concentration to absorbed dose rate in air at 1 m above the ground surface for uniform
distribution of naturally occurring radionuclides, dose coeffi- cients of 0.12 nGy h−1 per Bq kg−1 for 238U, 0.14 nGy h−1 per Bq
kg−1 for 232Th, and 0.0096 nGy h−1 per Bq kg−1 for 40K. These co-
value is lower that the world average indoor absorbed gamma dose rate of 84 nGy h−1. In the same vein, the estimated mean value of the indoor annual effective dose rate of 0.14 mSv y−1 is less than the world indoor average value of 0.49 mSv y−1 [9] and 1.0 mSv y−1 limit set by the International Committee on Radiation Protection (ICRP).


Radium equivalent activity concentration (Raeq)

In order to compare the specific activity of materials contain- ing different amount of 238U, 232Th and 40K, the radium equivalent activity Raeq is used as defined by the following expression [12,13]:

efficients were used to calculate the dose rates of superficial material with a thickness of about 3 cm and a density of about
2600 kg m−3 on all walls [11].

(1)
Where CU, CTh, and CK are the specific activity concentra- tions of 238U, 232Th, and 40K in Bq kg−1, respectively. All values of Raeq in the studied samples are lower than the recom-
mended limit (370 Bq kg−1). As shown in column 4 of Table 2,

Where CU is the specific activity concentration of 238U, CTh is the specific activity concentration of 232Th, CK specific ac-
tivity concentration of 40K in Bq kg−1, and DR is the dose rate
the mean value of Raeq (272 Bq kg−1) obtained for the ceramic tiles of Ile-Ife is below the recommended safe limit and thus
does not pose any radiological hazard when used in a build-

in nGy h−1.
In order to determine the annual effective dose rate to whole body indoor, an indoor occupancy factor of 0.8, a conversion factor of 0.7 Sv Gy−1 from absorbed dose in air to effective dose
as proposed by Ref. [9] was employed.

Radon, a gaseous radionuclide and its shortlived daughters are hazardous to the respiratory organs. The internal hazard index (Hin) gives the internal exposure to carcinogenic radon and its shortlived progeny. Hin is given by the following equation [17].

The estimated DR values are presented in column 2 of Table 2. As shown in the table, the dose rate varies from 14 (Ida6) to 41 (Ida2) nGy h−1 with a mean value of 29 nGy h−1. This mean

where CU, CTh, and CK are the specific activity concentrations
of 238U, 232Th, and 40K in Bq kg−1, respectively. The values of Hin as shown in column 5 of Table 2 ranged from 0.42 to 1.12 with
a mean value of 0.8.

External hazard index (Hex)
The external hazard index is an additional measure used in order to evaluate the external gamma radiation emanating from building materials. It is used to assess the suitability of a build- ing material. It was calculated as follows [13]:
the ceramic tiles studied in this work are presented in Table 2. The calculated values ranged from 0.07 to 0.17 with a mean value of 0.14. This shows that these materials can be safely used in building construction.

Excess lifetime cancer risk (EC)

The excess lifetime cancer risk was calculated using the fol- lowing equation [13,23]:


Hex  	CU	  	CTh	  	CK	  1	(5)
EC  Ad mSv y1   LT  RF

where Ad, LT, and RF are the annual effective dose equiva- lent, lifetime (duration of life 70 years) and the risk factor

where CU, CTh, and CK are the specific activity concentrations of 238U, 232Th, and 40K in Bq kg−1, respectively. To ensure the safe use of these samples as a building material and to keep the
radiation hazard insignificant, the value of Hex should be less than unity [18]. As shown in Table 2, it can be seen that all but one (Ida2) value are below the standard limit of 1.

Alpha index (Iα)

It has been shown that there is a linear relationship between radon exhalation rate and sample thickness [19,20] particu- larly for samples with a thickness that is less than the diffusion length of radon. The diffusion length of radon has been esti- mated to be 16.0 ± 0.7 cm [21]. The average thickness of ceramic tiles is less than 5 cm. Hence, alpha index was used to assess the excess alpha radiation exposure caused by radon inhala-
tion from building materials. The Alpha index (Iα) was determined as follows [4]:
(0.005Sv−1), respectively. For stochastic effects, a value of 0.05
was used for the public. The world average value of excess life- time cancer risk is 0.29 × 10−3 [9]. The result obtained are presented in Table 2. From the table, the average value of excess
lifetime cancer risk is slightly higher than the world average value.

Annual Gonadal dose equivalent AGd (µSv y–1)

The annual genetically significant dose equivalent (AGd) to the population is a measure of the genetic significance of the yearly dose equivalent received by the population’s reproductive organs (gonads) [24]. The gonads are particularly radiosensi- tive. A single dose of only 0.3Gy (30 rads) to the testes may result in temporary sterility among men; for women, a 3-Gy (300- rad) dose to the ovaries may lead to temporary sterility. Higher doses increase the period of temporary sterility [25]. The Annual Gonadal dose equivalent was calculated using the equation below [26].

where CU is the specific activity concentration of 238U in Bq kg−1. The recommended limit for Iα in building materials is 1.0 as suggested by the Radiation Protection Authorities in Denmark,
Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden [22]. As can be ob- served in Table 2 column 8, all the values of Iα obtained are below the recommended limit. This shows that radon inha-
The calculated AGd according to Eq. (9) ranged from 0.42 to
1.25 μSv y−1 with a mean value of 0.87 μSv y−1. Therefore, all the ceramic tiles sampled have values lower than 1 mSv y−1 as rec- ommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) for members of the public.

lation from the ceramic tiles studied would not cause any excess		

radiation exposure when used as a building material.

Activity concentration index (Iγ)

The activity concentration index (Iγ) is derived to indicate whether the annual dose due to the excess external gamma radiation in a building may exceed 1 mSv. The activity index
is calculated for superficial material in the following way [11]:
Statistical evaluation

Descriptive statistics

Descriptive statistics include basic statistics (mean, median, variance, etc.), frequency counts, and correlation coefficients of a set of data. It provides an overview of the entire data. The list of basic statistical data, (mean, median, standard devia- tion, sum, median, range) of the ceramic samples are presented

I  	CU	  	CTh	  	Ck	  1 1701 Bq kg  1458 Bq kg  21259 Bq kg
(7)
in Table 4. The table helps to simplify the data sets in a way that gives meaningful insight and indicate natural correla- tions between the variables.

where CU is the specific activity concentration of 238U, CTh is the activity concentration of 232Th and CK is the activity concen- tration of 40K in Bq kg−1. The activity concentration index is a screening tool for determining materials that might be of
concern when used as a building material. The values of Iγ for
The spread of the data is evaluated by the standard devia- tion. From Table 4, the range of each variable can easily be deduced from the minimum and maximum values. For 40K, the range is 57.67–1768.48, for 238U the range is 15.89–42.78. Out of the seven types of ceramic tile studied, 40K has a mean value






of 850.14 Bq kg−1, while 238U has 24.01 Bq kg−1 and 232Th has 127.92 as mean. This indicates that gamma radiation activities from the ceramic tiles studied are due more to 40K than to the other two primordial radionuclides that is 238U and 232Th.

Correlation analysis

Correlation is a bivariate analysis that measures the strengths of association between two variables. In statistics, the value of the correlation coefficient varies between +1 and −1. When the value of the correlation coefficient lies around ±1, then it is said to be a perfect degree of association between the two variables. As the correlation coefficient value goes toward 0, the relationship between the two variables will be weaker.
Correlation coefficient is used as a measure of relation- ship between two variables. Spearman’s correlation coefficient is a statistical measure of the strength of a monotonic rela- tionship between paired data. Spearman correlation is a common substitute for Pearson correlation coefficient when non-parametric statistics is involved.
All the evaluated variables were subjected to Spearman’s correlation analysis to determine the mutual relations and the degree of association between pairs of variables. Table 5 shows the correlation coefficient matrix of all the radiological vari- ables considered for the ceramic tile types in Ile-Ife. The strength of the correlation is defined for the absolute value of the Spear- man coefficient as 0.00–0.19 (very weak), 0.20–0.39 (weak), 0.40–
0.59 (moderate), 0.60–0.79 (strong), and 0.80–1.0 (very strong). It can be seen from the table that a high positive correlation exists among all the variables. The Spearman’s correlation co- efficient value of 1 in the matrix is a reflection of the perfect monotonic relationship that exists between the pairs. Simi- larly, from the data in Table 5, all but one coefficient fall in the
strong to very strong correlation range. 40K has a very high cor- relation with all other variables except 232Th where it has a weak correlation. The high positive correlation coefficient ob- served between 232Th and 238U is due to the fact that radium and thorium decay series occur together in nature [27].

Conclusions

The activity concentration, gamma absorbed dose rate, radium equivalent activity, annual effective dose and various radio- logical hazard indices of ceramic tiles used in Ile-Ife have been analyzed using gamma spectrometry technique. The extracted values are, in general, comparable to the average worldwide ranges. The values obtained in this study are within the recommended safety limits, demonstrating that these ceramic tiles do not pose any significant radiation hazard when used as a building material. This study can be used as a base- line for future research work and also be used as a reference data for monitoring possible radioactivity pollutions in the future.
