In this article, an analytical solution based on the series expansion method is proposed to solve the time-fractional telegraph equation (TFTE) in two and three dimensions using a recent and reliable semi-approximate method, namely the reduced differential trans- formation method (RDTM) subjected to the appropriate initial condition. Using RDTM, it is possible to find exact solution or a closed approximate solution of a differential equation. The accuracy, efficiency, and convergence of the method are demonstrated through the four numerical examples.

Introduction

Several real phenomena emerging in engineering and science fields can be demonstrated successfully by developing models using the fractional calculus theory. Fractional differential theory has gained much more attention as the fractional order system response ultimately converges to the integer order equations. The applications of the fractional differentiation
for the mathematical modeling of real world physical prob- lems such as the earthquake modeling, the traffic flow model with fractional derivatives, measurement of viscoelastic ma- terial properties, etc., have been widespread in this modern era. Before the nineteenth century, no analytical solution method was available for such type of equations even for the linear fractional differential equations. Recently, Keskin and Oturanc [1] developed the reduced differential transform

method (RDTM) for the fractional differential equations and showed that RDTM is the easily useable semi analytical method and gives the exact solution for both the linear and nonlinear differential equations.
Let us assume that u(x,y,t) and i(x,y,t) denote the electric voltage and the current in a double conductor, then the time- fractional telegraphic equations (TFTEs) in the two dimension (2D) aregiven as
v2a u + 2p va u + q2u = v2 u + v2 u + f (x; y; t); 9=


equation directly without using linearization, transformation, discretization or restrictive assumptions. Also, the RDTM scheme is very easy to implement for the multidimensional time-fractional order physical problems emerging in various fields of engineering and science.

theory is almost more than two decades’ old in the literature.
Several definitions of fractional integrals and derivatives have been proposed but the first major contribution to give proper definition is due to Liouville as follows.

It has been observed that telegraph equation is more suitable than ordinary diffusion equation in modeling reac- tion diffusion. The hyperbolic partial differential equations model the vibrations of structures (e.g. machines, buildings and beams) and they are the basis for fundamental equations of atomic physics. The telegraph equation is an important equation for modeling several relevant problems in engi- neering and science such as wave propagation [2], random walk theory [3], signal analysis [4] etc. In recent years, from the literature it can be seen that much attention has been given to

The RiemanneLiouville derivative has certain disadvantages when
trying to model real world problems with fractional differential equations. To overcome this discrepancy, Caputo and Mainardi [24] proposed a modified fractional differentiation operator Da in his work on the theory of viscoelasticity. The Caputo fractional derivative al- lows the utilization of initial and boundary conditions involving integer order derivatives, which havte clear physical interpretations.

till now no one has applied the RDTM to solve the time-frac- tional order telegraphic equations in two and three dimensions.

In this study, the Caputo fractional derivative is taken since it allows traditional initial and boundary conditions to be included in the derivation of the problem. Some other properties of fractional de- rivative can be found in [25,26].

Conclusions

In the present study, we have illustrated the reduced differ- ential transform method for the analytical solution of two and three dimensional second order hyperbolic linear and nonlinear TFTEs. The method is applied in a direct way without using linearization, transformation, discretization or restrictive assumptions. The effectiveness of the method is shown from the computational results. These results show that the RDTM technique is highly accurate, rapidly converge and is very easily implementable mathematical tool for the multidimensional physical problems emerging in various fields of engineering and sciences.
