In this article, Laguerre Wavelets Method (LWM) is proposed and combined with steps Method to solve linear and nonlinear delay differential equations of fractional-order. Computational work is fully supportive of compatibility of proposed algorithm and hence the same may be extended to other physical problems also. A very high level of accuracy explicitly reflects the reliability of this scheme for such problems.

Introduction

Fractional differential equations are applied to model wide range of physical problems including nonlinear oscillation of earth quakes [1], fluid-dynamic traffic [2], frequency depen- dent damping behavior of many viscoelastic materials, signal processing [5] and control theory [6]. Moreover, in several areas of applied mathematics [1,7e11] fractional differential equations are often used. These are also used in the study of
epidemics, age-structured population growth [12], automa- tion, traffic flow and in many engineering problems. The basic motivation of this paper is to develop a Laguerre Wavelets Method (LWM) and combine it with the steps Method [13] to solve linear and nonlinear delay differential equations [4] of fractional-order. It is observed that proposed method is fully compatible with the complexity of such problems and is very user-friendly. The error estimates explicitly reveal the very high accuracy level of the suggested technique.

Laguerre Wavelets

from dilation and translation of a single function j(x) called Wavelets [2,3,5] constitute a family of functions constructed the mother wavelet. When the dilation parameter a and the
translation parameter b vary continuously we have the following family of continuous wavelets as [10]
j (x)= |a —1  x — b ; a; b2R; as0.
ya(x)= f (y)+ g(x)y x — c ; 0 < x < b; 1 < a ≤ 2;	(3)
y(x)= p(x); —b ≤ x ≤ 0.
where g(x) is a source term function, f (y) is a given continuous linear or nonlinear function.
According to the proposed method, first use the method of step to convert the delay differential equation (3) to inhomo- geneous ordinary differential equation by using initial func-



If we restrict the parameters a and b to discrete values as
a = a—k; b = nb0a—k; a0 > 1; b0 > 0; we have the following family

Conclusion

Linear and Nonlinear Delay Differential Equations of fractional-order are successfully tackled by Modified Laguerre Wavelets Method (MLWM). The solutions of the fractional delay differential equation converge to the solution of integer delay differential equation, as shown in Figs. 1e4. According to the Tables, we get more accurate results while increasing
M. Computational work and numerical results explicitly reflect that the proposed method (MLWM) is very user-friendly but extremely accurate.
