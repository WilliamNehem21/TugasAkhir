1	Introduction
For a space X, it is well known that a subset U of X is open iff every net that converges to a point in U is residually in U (cf. [2]). Foe certain order-defined topologies, it suffices to test that criterion for monotone nets. Spaces or topologies with that property is called monotone determined in [3]. Ern´e [3] has shown that all locally hypercompact spaces and all Scott spaces are monotone determined, compact open subsets of monotone determined spaces are hypercompact, and a space is

hypercompactly based iff it is monotone determined and compactly based. It follows that the monotone determined monotone convergence spaces are exactly the Scott spaces of dcpos, the hypercompactly based sober spaces are exactly the Scott spaces of quasialgebraic domains, which gave a negative answer for the question posed by Priestley in [9]: whether there exists a non-quasicontinuous domain on which the Scott topology is spectral.
In this paper, we investigate some basic properties of monotone determined spaces, especially the categorical properties. For a topology τ , we construct a mono- tone determined topology md(τ ). It is shown that md(τ ) is the weakest monotone determined topology on X containing τ and clτ D = clmd(τ )D for any directed sub- set D. Let Topmd be the category of monotone determined spaces with continuous maps and Top the category of all topology spaces with continuous maps. We show
that the product and the limit of monotone determined spaces are md(Qi∈I Xi)
and md(l→im−j Xj), respectively, where Qi∈I Xi and l→im−j Xj are the product and the
limit in Top, respectively. It is proved that Topmd is fully co-reflexive in Top and
Topmd is cartesian closed.
2  Preliminaries
In this section we recall some basic definitions and notations used in this note, more details can be found in [1,5,8]. Let P be a poset, x ∈ P, A ⊆ P . Let ↑x = {y ∈ P : x ≤ y} and ↑A = {y ∈ P : x ≤ y for some x ∈ A}, ↓ x and ↓A are defined dually. A is said to be an upper set if A = ↑A. A↑ and A↓ denote the sets of all upper and lower bounds of A, respectively. Let Aδ = (A↑)↓. P is said to be a directed complete poset, a dcpo for short, if every directed subset of P has the least upper bound in
P . The Alexandroff topology A(P ) on P is the topology consisting of all its upper subsets. The topology generated by the collection of sets P\↓x(as subbasic open subsets) is called upper topology and denote by ν(P ). A subset U of P is called Scott open if U = ↑U and D ∩ U /= ∅ for all directed sets D ⊆ P with ∨D ∈ U whenever ∨D exists. The topology formed by all the Scott open sets of P is called the Scott topology, written as σ(P ).
We order the collection of nonempty subsets of a poset P by G ≤ H if ↑H ⊆ ↑G. We say that a nonempty family of sets is directed if given F1, F2 in the family, there exists F in the family such that F1, F2 ≤ F , i.e., F ⊆ ↑F1 ∩ ↑F2. For nonempty subsets F and G of a dcpo L, we say F approximates G if whenever a directed subset D satisfies ∨D ∈ ↑G, then d ∈ ↑F for some d ∈ D. A dcpo L is called a quasicontinuous domain if for all x ∈ L, ↑x is the directed (with respect to reverse inclusion) intersection of sets of the forms ↑F , where F approximates {x} and F is finite.
Give a topological space (X, τ ), define an order ≤τ , called the specialization order, by x ≤τ y if and only if x ∈ clτ {y}. Clearly, each open set is an upper set and each closed set is a lower set with respect to the specialization order ≤τ . Denote the closure of subset A ⊆ X by clτ A and interior of A by intτ A in (X, τ ).
Definition 2.1 ([3]) A space is called locally hypercompact if for any x ∈ X and

U ∈ τ with x ∈ U , there exists a finite set F such that x ∈ intτ ↑F ⊆ ↑F ⊆ U .
Definition 2.2 ([6,10]) Let P be a poset.
Given any two elements x and y in P , define a relation ≺ on P by x ≺ y iff
y ∈ intν(P )↑x;
P is called hypercontinuous if x = ∨{u ∈ P : u ≺ x} for all x ∈ P .
Theorem 2.3 ([10]) A poset P is hypercontinuous if and only if for all x ∈ P and
U ∈ ν(P ) with x ∈ U, there exists a y ∈ P such that x ∈ intν(P )↑y ⊆ ↑y ⊆ U.
Definition 2.4 ([10]) Let P be a poset. P is called quasi-hypercontinuous if for all x ∈ P and U ∈ ν(P ) with x ∈ U , there exists a finite set F ⊆ P such that x ∈ intν(P )↑F ⊆ ↑F ⊆ U .
Theorem 2.5 ([11,12]) Let P be a poset. Then the following conditions are equiv- alent:
P is quasi-hypercontinuous;
(ν(P ), ⊆) is a hypercontinuous lattice;
ν(P ) is locally hypercompact.
Definition 2.6 ([13]) Let P be a poset.
Given any two subsets G and H in P , we say that G approximates H and write G  2 H, if for all directed sets D ⊆ P , ↑H ∩ Dδ /= ∅ implies ↑G ∩ D /= ∅. Let w(x)= {F ⊆ P : F is finite and F  2 x}.
P is called s2-quasicontinuous if for each x ∈ P , ↑x =  {↑F : F ∈ w(x)} and
w(x) is directed.
Obviously, if P is a dcpo, then s2-quasicontinuity is equivalent to the quasicon- tinuity.
Definition 2.7 ([3,4]) Let P be a poset. A subset U ⊆ P is called weak Scott open
if it satisfies
U = ↑U ;
For all directed sets D ⊆ P , Dδ ∩ U /= ∅ implies D ∩ U /= ∅.
The collection of all weak Scott open subsets of P forms a topology, it will be called the weak Scott topology of P and will be denoted by σ2(P ). Clearly, ν(P ) ⊆ σ2(P ) ⊆ σ(P ) and σ2(P ) coincide with σ(P ) on dcpos.
Theorem 2.8 ([13]) For a poset P, the following statements are equivalent:
P is an s2-quasicontinuous poset;
σ2(P ) is locally hypercompact;
(σ2(P ), ⊆) is a hypercontinuous lattice.

3  Monotone determined spaces
In this section, we will give some properties of monotone determined spaces and construct a monotone determined topology md(τ ) from any given topology τ .
Definition 3.1 ([3]) A topological space (X, τ ) is called a monotone determined space,a MD-space for short, if any subset U meeting all directed sets whose closure meets U is open, that is, U ∈ τ iff U ∩ clτ D /= ∅ implies U ∩ D /= ∅. The topology τ is called a monotone determined topology, a MD-topology for short,
Lemma 3.2 ([3]) (1) The weakest monotone determined topology with a given specialization order is the weak Scott topology, the strongest is the Alexandorff topology;
Every locally hypercompact space is a MD-space;
A poset P associating with Scott topology σ(P ) is a MD-space.
Definition 3.3 Let (X, τ ) be a space, U ⊆ X, U is call MD-open if and only if for any directed subset D ⊆ X, clτ D ∩ U /= ∅ implies D ∩ U /= ∅. The collection of all MD-open sets is denote by md(τ ).
It is immediate that an arbitrary unions of MD-open sets is again MD-open and almost immediate that the same is true for finite intersection. Indeed, Let U, V ∈ md(τ ) and D ⊆ X be a directed subset which satisfies clτ D ∩ (U ∩ V ) /= ∅, then clτ D ∩ U /= ∅ and clτ D ∩ V /= ∅. Since U, V ∈ md(τ ), there exist d1, d2 ∈ D such that d1 ∈ U and d2 ∈ V , thus there is a d ∈ D such that d1, d2 ≤ d. Notice that U, V are upper sets, which implies d ∈ U ∩ V , so D ∩ (U ∩ V ) /= ∅. This proves that U ∩ V ∈ md(τ ). Hence the MD-open sets form a topology. Obviously, we have τ ⊆ md(τ ).
Lemma 3.4 Let (X, τ ) be a space.  Then for any directed subset D, clτ D =
clmd(τ )D and ≤τ =≤md(τ );
Proof. Clearly, clτ D ≥ clmd(τ )D since τ ⊆ md(τ ). On the other side, for any x ∈ clτ D and U ∈ md(τ ) with x ∈ U , we have clτ D ∩ U /= ∅. From the definition of md(τ ), it follows that D ∩ U /= ∅, thus x ∈ clmd(τ )D. Therefore, clτ D = clmd(τ )D. For any x, y ∈ X, x ≤τ y iff x ∈ clτ y = clmd(τ )y iff x ≤md(τ) y.	2
Theorem 3.5 Let (X, τ ) be a space. Then md(τ )=min{α : α is a MD-topology on
X with τ ⊆ α}, that is, md(τ ) is the weakest MD-topology containing τ.
Proof. Firstly, we show that md(τ ) is a MD-topology. Let D ⊆ X be a directed subset and U ⊆ X. Suppose that clmd(τ )D∩U /= ∅ implies D∩U /= ∅. Now we have to show U ∈ md(τ ). If clτ D ∩ U /= ∅, by Lemma 3.4, we have clmd(τ )D ∩ U /= ∅. Thus D ∩ U /= ∅. By Definition 3.3, U ∈ md(τ ). Hence, md(τ ) is a MD-topology.
Let α be a MD-topology on X with τ ⊆ α. For any U ∈ md(τ ), if clαD ∩ U /= ∅ for a directed subset D, note that clτ D ≥ clαD, it follows that clτ D ∩ U /= ∅. Since U ∈ md(τ ) and α is a MD-topology, we have D ∩ U /= ∅ and U ∈ α. Thus md(τ ) ⊆ α.	2

Follows from preceding theorem, it is easy to see that (X, τ ) is a MD-space iff τ = md(τ ). Now question naturally arise: whether a poset P equipped with the upper topology ν(P ) is a MD-space? If not, what is the md(ν(P ))? Next, we will give an example to show that even if P is a complete lattice, (P, ν(P )) is not a MD-space, and it is proved that md(ν(P )) is exactly the weak Scott topology σ2(P ).
Example 3.6 Let L = {a} ∪ {bi : i ∈ N} ∪ {c}, where N denotes the set of all natural numbers. The order ≤ on L is defined as follows: for any i ∈ N , c ≤ bi ≤ a. Then (L, ν(L)) is not a MD-space. In fact, we can conclude that
↑b1 /∈ ν(L). Suppose not, since a ∈ ↑b1, there is a finite subset F ⊆ L such that a ∈ L\↓F ⊆ ↑b1 = {a, b1}, we have ↓F = {bi : i ∈ N and i ≥ 2}, which contradicts to F is finite. Hence ↑b1 /∈ ν(L). For any directed subset D ⊆ L, if clν(L)D ∩ ↑b1 /= ∅, Note that clν(L)D = ↓∨ D and ↑b1 ∈ σ(L), it follows that D ∩ ↑b1 /= ∅. Thus ↑b1 ∈ md(ν(L)). Hence, ν(L) /= md(ν(L)). Therefore, (L, ν(L)) is not a MD-space, as desired.
Lemma 3.7 Let P be a poset. Then for any directed subset D ⊆ P, clσ2(P )D =
clν(P )D = Dδ;
Proof. Clearly, clσ (P )D = Dδ. Since ν(P ) ⊆ σ2(P ), we have Dδ = clσ (P )D ⊆
clν(P )D. Note that Dδ = 
2	2
{↓x : D ⊆ ↓x}. Then it is easy to see that Dδ is a closed
set in ν(P ). So clν(P )D ⊆ Dδ. Hence clν(P )D = Dδ.	2
Theorem 3.8 Let P be a poset. Then md(ν(P )) = σ2(P ).
Proof. Since ν(P ) ⊆ σ2(P ), we have md(ν(P )) ⊆ md(σ2(P )) = σ2(P ). Let U ∈ σ2(P ) and D ⊆ P be a directed set with clν(P )D∩U /= ∅. By Lemma 3.7, clν(P )D = Dδ. Thus Dδ ∩ U /= ∅, it follows that D ∩ U /= ∅. So U ∈ md(ν(P )). Therefore, md(ν(P )) = σ2(P ).	2
Let τ be an order compatible topology(≤τ =≤) on P . Then ν(P ) ⊆ τ ⊆ A(P ), by Theorem 3.8, σ2(P )= md(ν(P )) ⊆ md(τ ) ⊆ md(A(P )) = A(P ). Hence we get the following Corollary by this way which is different from the manner given by Ern´e.
Corollary 3.9 ([3]) Let P be a poset and τ be an order compatible(≤τ =≤) MD- topology on P. Then σ2(P ) ⊆ τ ⊆ A(P ).
The following Corollaries are easy to obtain and the proof is omitted.
Corollary 3.10 Let P be a poset. ν(P ) is the MD-topology if and only if ν(P )= 
σ2(P ).
Corollary 3.11 Let (X, τ ) be a MD-space and τ be an order compatible topology. Then clτ D ⊆ Dδ for any directed subset D.
By Theorem 2.5, Theorem 2.8, Lemma 3.2 and Corollary 3.10, we immediately have:

Corollary 3.12 Let P be a poset. Then the following conditions are equivalent:
(ν(P ), ⊆) is a hypercontinuous lattice;
P is s2-quasicontinuous and ν(P )= σ2(P );
P is s2-quasicontinuous and ν(P ) is a MD-topology.
Corollary 3.13 Let L be a dcpo. Then the following conditions are equivalent:
P is a quasi-hypercontinuous domain;
P is a quasicontinuous domain and ν(P )= σ(P );
P is a quasicontinuous domain and ν(P ) is a MD-topology.
Denote the set of all topologies on set X by Top(X) and the set of all monotone determined topologies on X by Topmd(X).
Proposition 3.14 Let X be a set and {τi : i ∈ I} ⊆ Topmd(X),  {τi : i ∈ I} is the least upper bound of {τi : i ∈ I} in Top(X). Then
{τi : i ∈ I}∈ Topmd(X);

md( {τi : i ∈ I})= 

T opmd(X)
{md(τi): i ∈ I}.

Proof. (1) Let  {τi : i ∈ I} = τ . Since τ ⊆ τi, we have x ≤τ
y, which implies

x ≤τ y for any i ∈ I. Thus, if D is a directed set in (X, ≤τi ), then D is directed in (X, ≤τ ).
Let D be a directed subset of (X, ≤τ ). Suppose that clτ D ∩ V /= ∅ implies
D ∩ V /= ∅, we need to show V ∈ τ =	{τi : i ∈ I}, that is, we have to prove that
V ∈ τi for each i ∈ I. For any i ∈ I, let Di be a directed subset of (X, ≤τi ), then Di is directed in (X, ≤τ ). If clτi Di∩V /= ∅, then clτ Di∩V /= ∅ which implies Di∩V /= ∅. Since τi is a MD-topology, we have V ∈ τi. Hence V ∈ τ . So {τi : i ∈ I} is the MD-topology.

(2) Obviously, md( {τi : i ∈ I}) ≥ 
T opmd(X)
{md(τi) : i ∈ I}. Suppose that

τ is a MD-topology on X containing md(τ ) for any i ∈ I. Next we have to show
τ ≥ md( {τi : i ∈ I}). Since τi ⊆ md(τi) ⊆ τ , we have  {τi : i ∈ I} ⊆ τ . Thus md( {τi : i ∈ I}) ⊆ md(τ )= τ . Hence, md( {τi : i ∈ I}) is the least upper bound containing  {τi : i ∈ I} in Topmd(X).	2
From Proposition 3.14, it can be easy to get the following theorem.
Theorem 3.15 Let X be a set and for any {τi : i ∈ I}⊆ Topmd(X),  {τi : i ∈ I} is the least upper bound of {τi : i ∈ I} in Top(X). Then Topmd(X) is a complete sublattice of Top(X).
4	The category of MD-spaces
Let Top denote the category of all topology spaces and continuous maps, and Topmd denote the category of all MD-spaces and continuous maps. In this section, we will discuss some category properties of MD-spaces, especially the cartesian closed property.

Lemma 4.1 Let (X, τ ) and (Y, σ) be two spaces. If the function f : (X, τ ) → (Y, σ) is continuous, then f∗ : (X, md(τ )) → (Y, md(σ)) which satisﬁes f∗(x) = f (x) is continuous.
Proof. For all V ∈ md(σ), we need to show that f−1(V ) ∈ md(τ ). For any directed subset D ⊆ X, suppose that clτ D ∩ f−1(V ) /= ∅. Since f : (X, τ ) → (Y, σ) is continuous, f (clτ D) ⊆ clσf (D), it follows that clσf (D) ∩ V /= ∅. Since V ∈ md(σ), we have f (D) ∩ V /= ∅, that is, D ∩ f−1(V ) /= ∅. Thus f−1(V ) ∈ md(τ ). Therefore f∗ is continuous.	2
Lemma 4.2 Let (X, τ ), (Y, σ) be two MD-spaces and f : (X, τ ) → (Y, σ) be a function. Then the following statements are equivalent:
f is continuous;
For any directed subset D ⊆ X, f (clτ D) ⊆ clσf (D).
Proof. (1) ⇒ (2) Obviously.
(2) ⇒ (1) Firstly, we show f is order preserving. Let x ≤τ y in X, then x ∈ clτ {y}. So f (x) ∈ f (clτ {y}) ⊆ clσf (y) = ↓f (y). Thus f (x) ≤σ f (y). For any U ∈ σ, we will show that f−1(U ) is an open set in X. Assume clτ D∩f−1(U ) /= ∅ for a directed subset D ⊆ X, then there exists a x ∈ clτ D such that f (x) ∈ U ∩f (clτ D). Thus f (x) ∈ U ∩ clσf (D). Since (Y, σ) is a MD-space, we have f (D) ∩ U /= ∅, that is D ∩ f−1(U ) /= ∅. Since (X, τ ) is a MD-space, f−1(U ) is an open set. Hence, f is continuous.	2
Define md : Top → Topmd as following: for any (X, τ ) ∈ Ob(Top) and f ∈ Mor(Top), md((X, τ )) = (X, md(τ )), md(f ) = f . It is easy to see that md is a functor.
Theorem 4.3 The category Topmd is fully co-reflexive in Top.
Proof. Given a space (X, τ ), let j : (X, md(τ )) → (X, τ ) be an identity function(j(x) = x). Suppose that f : (Y, α) → (X, τ ) is a continuous map with (Y, α) a MD-space. By Lemma 4.1, f∗ : (Y, md(α) = α) → (X, md(τ )) which sat- isfies f∗(y) = f (y) for any y ∈ Y is continuous, and f = j ◦ f∗. Assume there exists a continuous function g : (Y, α) → (X, md(τ )) such that f = j ◦ g, then f (y) = j(g(y)) = g(y) for any y ∈ Y , thus f∗ = g. Therefore, Topmd is fully co-reflexive in Top.	2
Let (X, τ ), (Y, σ) be spaces, X × Y denoted the cartesian product. Define an order ≤ on X × Y as followings: (x1, y1) ≤ (x2, y2) ⇔ x1 ≤τ x2, y1 ≤σ y2, this order is said to be pointwise order. Obviously, the pointwise order coincide with the specialization order on X × Y . For MD-spaces, it is natural to ask whether the cartesian product X × Y of MD-spaces is MD-space? Next, we will give a negative answer and construct the product in Topmd.
Lemma 4.4 ([5]) Let L be a complete lattice. If σ(L × L) = σ(L) × σ(L), then
σ(L) is sober.

Theorem 4.5 Let L be a complete lattice. If (L, σ(L)) is not sober, then (L, σ(L))×
(L, σ(L)) is not a MD-space.
Proof. Clearly, ν(L × L) = ν(L) × ν(L) ⊆ σ(L) × σ(L) ⊆ σ(L × L). By Lemma 3.2(3), σ(L× L) is a MD-topology. Assume that σ(L) × σ(L) is a MD-topology. By Theorem 3.8 and L×L is a complete lattice, it follows that σ(L×L)= σ(L) ×σ(L). By Lemma 4.4, (L, σ(L)) is sober, a contradiction.	2
In [7], Isbell constructed a complete lattice whose Scott topology is not sober.
Hence we have conclusion that the product of MD-spaces is not a MD-space.
Theorem 4.6 Let {Xi : i ∈ I} be a family of MD-spaces. Then md(Qi∈I Xi) is

the product of {Xi : i ∈ I} in Topmd, that is Q Qi∈I Xi is the product in Top.
T opmd
Xi = md(Q
i∈I
Xi), where

Proof. For any i ∈ I, let pi : md(Qi∈I Xi) → Xi be a project map. Suppose that (X, τ ) is a MD-space and fi : X → Xi is a continuous map. Since Qi∈I Xi is the product in Top, there exists a unique continuous maps f : X → Qi∈I Xi such
that pi ◦ f = fi for any i ∈ I. By Lemma 4.1, f∗ : X → md(Qi∈I Xi) satisfying
f∗(x)= f (x) is continuous and pi ◦ f∗ = fi. Hence, md(Qi∈I Xi)= QT op	Xi. 2
In the remainder parts of this section, we denote the product of {(Xi, τi): i ∈ I}
in Topmd by Q	Xi for convenience.
Theorem 4.7 Let D : J → Topmd be a diagram. Then md(l→im−j Xj) is the limit of D in Topmd, where l→im−j Xj is the limit in Top.
Proof. Denote the limiting cone in Top by (l→im−j Xj, pj), where pj : l→im−j Xj → Xj
is continuous. By Lemma 4.1, p∗ : md(l→im−j Xj) → Xj is continuous. Next we
have to show that (md(limjXj), p∗) is the limiting cone in Topmd. Let (X, τ ) be
→−	j
a MD-space and given any cone (X,, cj) to D. Since l→im−j Xj is the limit in Top,
there isa unique continuous map u : X → l→im−j Xj such that for all j, pj ◦ u = cj, it
follows that u∗ = u : X → md(limjXj) is continuous satisfying p∗ ◦ u = c∗. Hence,
→−	j	j
md(l→im−j Xj) is the limit of D in Topmd.	2
Using the similar proof, we can get the following results:
Theorem 4.8 Let {Xi : i ∈ I} be a family of MD-spaces, and D : J → Topmd be a diagram. Then
T opmd Xi = md(  i∈I Xi), where  i∈I Xi is the coproduct in Top.
md(l−i→mjXj) is the colimit of D in Topmd, where l−i→mjXj is the colimit in Top.
From above theorems, we know that Topmd is a complete subcategory. So the functor md : Top → Topmd preserve limit and colimit.
At the end of this section, we will discuss the cartesian closed property of the category Topmd. Let (X, τ ), (Y, σ) be two spaces. Denote the set of all continuous maps from (X, τ ) to (Y, σ) by Y X , i.e., Y X = {f : (X, τ ) → (Y, σ)|f is continuous
}.

Definition 4.9 ([2,8]) Let (X, τ ), (Y, σ) be two spaces. Given a point x ∈ X and an open set U ∈ σ, let S(x, U )= {f : f ∈ Y X and f (x) ∈ U}, the sets S(x, U ) are a subbasis for topology on Y X , which is called the topology of pointwise convergence. Denote the pointwise convergence topology by S.
Define the usually pointwise order on Y X : f ≤ g ⇔ f (x) ≤ g(x) for any x ∈ X. It is easy to see that the specialization order ≤S coincide with the pointwise order ≤ on Y X . The set Y X equipped with the pointwise convergence topology S denote by S(X, Y ), that is, S(X, Y )= (Y X, S). Hence, md(S(X, Y )) = (Y X, md(S)), written as Smd(X, Y ). Obviously, Smd(X, Y ) is a MD-space.
Lemma 4.10 ([2,8]) Let {fd : d ∈ D}⊆ Y X be a net. Then {fd}d∈D converges to the function f ∈ Y X in the topology of pointwise convergence S if and only if for each x ∈ X, the net {fd(x)}d∈D converges to f (x).
Lemma 4.11 Let (X, τ ), (Y, σ) and (Z, α) be MD-spaces, (x, y) ∈ X × Y . If f : X ×md Y → Z is continuous, then ϕ(f ): X → Smd(Y, Z) deﬁned by ϕ(f )(x)(y)= f (x, y) is continuous.
Proof. Clearly, ϕ(f ) is order preserving. Since X and Smd(Y, Z) are MD-spaces, we have only to show that ϕ(f )(clτ D) ⊆ clmd(S)ϕ(f )(D) for any directed set D. Let x ∈ clτ D. For any y ∈ Y , we have (x, y) ∈ clτ D × clσ{y} = clτ×σD × {y} = clmd(τ×σ)D × {y}. Suppose that U ∈ α with ϕ(f )(x)(y) = f (x, y) ∈ U , then (x, y) ∈ f−1(U ) and f−1(U ) is an open set in X×mdY . Thus (D×{y})∩f−1(U ) /= ∅, which implies that there is a d ∈ D such that (d, y) ∈ f−1(U ), that is ,f (d, y) ∈ U . Hence ϕ(f )(x)(y)= f (x, y) ∈ clα{f (d, y): d ∈ D} = clαϕ(f )(D)(y). By arbitrary
of y and Lemma 4.10, ϕ(f )(x) ∈ clS ϕ(f )(D)= clmd(S)ϕ(f )(D). Thus ϕ(f )(clτ D) ⊆
clmd(S)ϕ(f )(D). By Lemma 4.2, ϕ(f ) is continuous.	2
Lemma 4.12 Let (X, τ ), (Y, σ) and (Z, α) be MD-spaces, (x, y) ∈ X × Y . If g : X → Smd(Y, Z) is continuous, then ψ(g): X×mdY → Z which satisﬁes ψ(g)(x, y)= g(x)(y) is continuous.
Proof. Firstly, we show that the evaluation map e : Smd(Y, Z) ×md Y → Z which sends (f, y) to f (y) is continuous. Clearly, e is order preserving. Let D ⊆ Smd(Y, Z) ×md Y be a directed subset and (f, y) ∈ clmd(md(S)×σ)D = clmd(S)×σ D. Then f ∈ clmd(S)p1(D) = clS p1(D) and y ∈ clσp2(D), where p1 : Smd(Y, Z) ×md Y → Smd(Y, Z) and p2 : Smd(Y, Z) ×md Y → Y are projec- tion maps. Let U ∈ α with e(f, y)= f (y) ∈ U . Then y ∈ f−1(U ) ∈ σ. Note that y ∈ clσp2(D). Thus f−1(U ) ∩ p2(D) /= ∅, which implies there exists a (g1, y1) ∈ D such that f (y1) ∈ U . Since f ∈ clS p1(D) and S is pointwise convergence topology, by Lemma 4.10, f (y1) ∈ clαp1(D)(y1). Thus U ∩ p1(D)(y1) /= ∅, that is, there exists a (g2, y2) ∈ D such that g2(y1) ∈ U . Since D is directed, it follows that there is a (g0, y0) ∈ D such that (g1, y1), (g2, y2) ≤ (g0, y0), that is, g1, g2 ≤ g0 and y1, y2 ≤ y0, we know that gi(i = 0, 1, 2) are order preserving and U is an upper set, which implies that g2(y1) ≤ g2(y0) ≤ g0(y0) and g0(y0) ∈ U . Hence U ∩ e(D) /= ∅, it follows that e(f, y) ∈ clαe(D). Thus e(clmd(md(S)×σ)D) ⊆ clαe(D). By Lemma 4.2, the evaluation map e is continuous.

Suppose g : X → Smd(Y, Z) is continuous. Since ψ(g) equals the composite g × iY : X × Y → Smd(Y, Z) × Y and e : Smd(Y, Z) ×md Y → Z, where iY is the identity map of Y , it follows that ψ(g) is continuous.	2
Theorem 4.13 Let (X, τ ), (Y, σ) and (Z, α) be MD-spaces. Then Smd(X ×md Y, Z)
is isomorphism to Smd(X, Smd(Y, Z)).
Proof. For any (x, y) ∈ X × Y , f ∈ ZX×mdY  and g ∈ Smd(Y, Z)X , de- fine ϕ : Smd(X ×md Y, Z) → Smd(X, Smd(Y, Z)) by ϕ(f )(x)(y) = f (x, y) and
ψ : Smd(X, Smd(Y, Z)) → Smd(X ×md Y, Z) by ψ(g)(x, y) = g(x)(y). By Lemma
4.11 and Lemma 4.12, ϕ and ψ are defined well. It is easy to see that ϕ ◦ ψ(g)= g,
ψ ◦ ϕ(f )= f and ϕ, ψ are order preserving.
Now we only have to show that ϕ and ψ are continuous. For any directed subset D = {fi : i ∈ I}⊆ Smd(X×md Y, Z). Denote the pointwise convergence topology on ZX×mdY and (Smd(Y, Z))X by S1 and S2, respectively. Let f ∈ clmd(S )D = clS D,
1	1
by Lemma 4.10, f (x, y) ∈ clα{fi(x, y) : i ∈ I} for any (x, y) ∈ X × Y . Then
ϕ(f )(x)(y) = f (x, y) ∈ clα{fi(x, y) : i ∈ I} = clα{ϕ(fi)(x)(y) : i ∈ I}. Thus
ϕ(f ) ∈ clmd(S2){ϕ(fi): i ∈ I}, hence ϕ(clmd(S1)D) ⊆ clmd(S2)ϕ(D). By Lemma 4.2, ϕ is continuous. Similarly, we can prove that ψ is continuous. All these show that Smd(X ×md Y, Z) is isomorphism to Smd(X, Smd(Y, Z)).	2
Now we can immediately obtain the following theorem:
Theorem 4.14 The category Topmd is cartesian closed.
