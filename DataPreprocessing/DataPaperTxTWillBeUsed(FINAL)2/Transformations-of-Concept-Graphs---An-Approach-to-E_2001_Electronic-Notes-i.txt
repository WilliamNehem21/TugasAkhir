1	Concept Lattices

Let R be a binary relation, as illustrated in Figure 1(a), with m rows and n columns. Such a relation can represent many phenomena and there exists an extensive literature on relational algebras [1]. In this paper we take a more limited view and simply regard R as an observation of a set of attributes A associated with a set of objects O. In our formulation, objects are denoted by numbered rows and attributes denoted by lettered columns.
\Formal Concept Analysis" [5] has been developed by Rudolf Wille [15], Bernard Ganter and their colleagues at Darmstadt. In their approach the construction and visual display of concept lattices, that is partially ordered sets of concepts, is crucial. The nodes of the concept lattice correspond to abstract concepts of the phenomenon being modelled and relationships within the lattice are re ective of relationships in the external world. Their book has numerous examples, and their method has found application in industrial applications (reported by Ganter & Wille) and in code re-engineering [8,14].
What makes it interesting to this workshop is an investigation of how these concept lattices are transformed with the advent of new information.
We begin with a very brief overview of concept lattices. Let R be a binary relation between any two sets O and A, as in Figure 1(a). We regard O as a set of objects and A as a set of attributes. But, they can be arbitrary sets. For example, Lindig and Snelting [8] apply concept analysis to legacy code by creating a relation R between P , a set of procedures, and V , a set of global variables.
By the closure, 'R of O with respect to R, we mean a maximal set of objects which share the same attributes as all o 2 O. Similarly, 'R 1 operating on a set A of attributes picks up any other attributes that are common to all objects which satisfy each a 2 A. 1 Ganter and Wille [5] show that 'R and

'R 1 are indeed closure operators, and constitute a Galois connection. For any R, such as that of Figure 1(a), the closure systems of 'R and 'R 1 are isomorphic and can be represented by the lattice LR of closed sets shown in Figure 1(b), which are partially ordered by inclusion. Labeling each node is

the pair of closed sets that is joined by the Galois connection, for example
< abg; 123 >. The set abg is closed in A; 123 is closed in O. In this case we have oriented the lattice with respect to A, the set of attributes, where the universe A = abcdef ghi (which must be closed) is the lattice supremum. The singleton set fag, which is an attribute of every object is the lattice inf imum. It is partially ordered with respect to set inclusion.
Readily, the concept lattice L is a visual model of the content of R. There are many similar examples of applied concept analysis in Ganter's and Wille's book [5]. Later extensions to concept analysis are reported in [16].

2	Closure Spaces

An operator ' is a closure operator if X  X:', X  Y ) X:'  Y:', and X:':' X:'. The Galois closure on binary relations is one kind of discrete closure operator. A more general treatment of closure spaces has been advanced in [9,12]. A central idea in these papers is that of the generators of a closed set, Z, denoted Z: , by which we mean a minimal set Y such that Y:' = Z. For example, with a convex hull closure operator, the generators of a convex n-gon are its n vertices (or extreme points). 2

a:R 1  O. Conversely, one forms the closure, '
R 1
of A with respect to

	
R consisting of the closed sets A = Ak:R 1:R. The set Oi:R denotes the set of all attributes shared by every object in O. Consequently, Oi:' = Oi:R:R 1 denotes  the set of all the objects that share (at least) these common attributes. Similarly, Ak:R 1 denotes the set of all objects sharing every attribute in Ak and Ak:' = Ak:R 1:R consists of all the attributes shared by the objects which (at least) have Y in common.
2  In the discrete geometry literature [3] all generators are called extreme points.


An n-gon is uniquely determined by its generators. Whenever the gener- ators of a closed set must be unique, we say the closure operator is uniquely generated and call the resulting closure space an antimatroid. 3 Much of the closure literature, e.g. [2,3,4,9,12] assumes antimatroid closure.
Using concepts from closure spaces, it is quite straightforward to generate the concept lattice while simultaneously determining the generators of these closed concepts. For example, the single attribute e generates the closed con- cept acde. That is, feg:'R 1 = facdeg. To see this in R, observe that every object which has property e (there is only one!) also has properties a, c and
d as well. Similarly we nd that either fbdg or fbf g will generate fabdf g because attributes b and d only found together in objects 5 and 6, which also share attributes abdf . This closure space, and most arising from concept anal- ysis, are not antimatroid. Nevertheless, they retain much of the structure of antimatroid closure spaces [7].
If we regard R as a relation in the database sense, then (o; a) 2 R denotes that a is an attribute of object o. In Figure 1(a) it is clear that abgh are shared attributes of objects 2 and 3. Attributes bh generate abgh. So we may assert that in this world (8o 2 O)[o:bh ) o:abgh]; or more simply we have the attribute implication bh ) abgh Similarly one may show that both bcd and bcf are minimal generators of abcdf ; so we have the attribute implication bcd _ bcf ) abcdf . By deriving the generators of all the closed concept sets, we extract all the logical implications (universally quanti ed over O) that are valid for R. From now on we will use ) to denote both attribute implication and closure generation.
The interpretation of X: and X:' as precedent and consequent respec- tively in a rule based description of a discrete world opens up a entire new approach to knowledge discovery [11] that can be exploited in relatively small discrete worlds. 4 Although this cursory description of the generators of closed sets in a concept lattices may be too brief for full comprehension, it should be su√Ücient to suggest the potential for modeling inductive learning by incre- mentally adding observations (rows) to R.


3	Inductive Transformations

If a concept lattice LR captures all the logical attribute implications one can make about a collection of objects; 5 it is natural to ask \suppose we observe

3 Matroids and antimatroids are identical, except that the closure operator of a matroid satis es an exchange axiom while the closure operators of an antimatroid satis es an anti- exchange axiom.
4 A robot project at U.Va. [6] gathers sensor data about objects in its world in a relational table. It will use our algorithm to convert this data into implications for input to its rule based planning component.

one more object and its attributes. How will this transform the lattice LR?" This is the essence of discrete, empirical induction. Given a collection R of observations that have an internal structure denoted by LR , how does new information transform this structure? Actually, such transformations are in- herently \graceful" and \local" in nature because of a fundamental property of closed sets | the intersection of closed sets must be closed. This leads to an interesting interplay between closed sets Z = X:' and their generators Z: .
Every time we add a row (object/attributes observation) to R, we add at least one new closed set to LR, because the attributes of a single row constitute a closed set of A 6 . Let < o0 ; A0 > denote this new row. If there exists Z 2 L such that A0 = Z, then the lattice remains unchanged. Suppose not. Then, there exists at least one closed Z in L	such that A0  Z. We consider A0 \ Y for all closed Y; Y  Z. These are the only elements of the concept lattice LR with which A0 can interact.
For example, appending to R a new observation of object 9 with attributes a, c and g yields the relation of Figure 2(a) and the corresponding concept

This newly observed datum has also changed the generation structure of LR . In LR , we have (cg _ ch) ) acgh. In LR2 , we have cg ) acg, so cg can no longer be a generator of argh. Now in LR2 , ch ) acgh.
We observe that this new object is not very di erent from existing ob- jects. It is contained in Z = acgh, which is fairly low in LR . Suppose Z = abcdef ghi = U, the universe of attributes? One can show that ef is a generator of abcdef ghi, along with 11 other minimal generators. But, there are no objects associated with abcdef ghi = A. In this world, ef is a logical

contradiction. 7 In Figure 3(a) we have now changed the new object 9 so it has the attributes a, d, e and f . The combination ef is no longer a contradiction. In LR3 , adef is covered by Z = U. It intersects acde and abcdf (which are also covered by Z) in ade and adf respectively. The closed set ade is new, and it recursively intersects with acd (which is also covered by acde) as ad. The

For a nal example, we observe that a is an attribute of every object. It corresponds to logical tautology in the universe of R. By adding a 9th row with only attributes def we change that. It intersects with acde and abcdf to create de and df respectively and the interesting concept lattice of Figure 4(b).

Addition of new rows (empirical observations) to the logical world de- scribed by a binary relation R engenders a regular graceful transformation of the concept lattice based on iterated set intersection. Conversely, it has been shown [10,13] that deletion of an element from an antimatroid closure space

induces a lattice homomorphism on its closure lattice L. 8 As observed ear- lier, concept closure spaces are not normally antimatroid. We conjecture, but have not yet proven, that deletion in concept lattices will still induce at least a meet homomorphism.
Together, these results would indicate that the gradual accumulation of
\knowledge" based on sequential, empirical observation is relatively \stable". Certainly, this is in accord with our intuitive, psychological understanding of knowledge. But, this is still very active research. For example, we conjecture that as the concept lattice becomes large, the expected magnitude of incre- mental change will become small. Also, we would like to know what a major restructuring of the concept lattice (a world understanding) would look like
| and what might cause it.
