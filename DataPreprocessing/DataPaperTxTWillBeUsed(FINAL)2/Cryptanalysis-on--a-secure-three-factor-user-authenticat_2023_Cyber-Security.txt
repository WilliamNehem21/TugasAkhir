Keywords: Authentication Smart cards
Telecare medicine information system User anonymity
The health-care delivery services were made possible by telecare medicine information systems (TMIS). These systems are paving the way for a world where computerised telecare facilities and automated patient medical records are the norm. Authentication schemes are common mechanisms for preventing unauthorised access to medical records via insecure networks. Amin and Biswas recently proposed an authentication scheme for TMIS, asserting that their scheme can withstand various attacks. Despite this, their scheme still has significant security weaknesses. In this paper, we present a cryptanalysis of Amin and Biswas’ scheme and show that it is subject to a variety of attacks.





Introduction

The increased proliferation of distributed networks has resulted in more resource and service exchange among user devices. As a result, during this cyber-connected period, there has been an increase in trans- action volume.
Due to the open nature of network that is dispersed, for application systems, system security and robust privacy protection techniques have become an inevitable requirement. As a result, authentication of the user may be a critical security element that must be included in such systems in order to distinguish legitimate users from potential threats.
One of the applications of distributed networks is the Telecare med- ical information system (TMIS). TMIS creates an effective and practical connection through an insecure internet between the patient and the doctor. Therefore, in order to access critical medical data over unse- cure communication, data security, privacy, and user authentication are of utmost importance. There have been numerous user authentication mechanisms for TMIS proposed recently [1–22], but it has been shown that the majority of these protocols fall short of meeting all security requirements.
tication. It’s also susceptible to forging and password guessing attacks when used oﬄine.
The remainder of the paper is divided into the following sections. The scheme devised by Amin and Biswas is examined in Section 2. Section 3 discusses the problems in Amin and Biswas’ strategy. In Section 4, you’ll find the conclusions.
Review of the scheme [24]

Registration, login, authentication, and password update are the four sections of the authentication process. The explanations are as follows:

Furthermore, Amin and Biswas concluded that Mishra et al’s is susceptible to a variety of attacks. Then, to address the shortcomings in Mishra et al’s scheme, Amin and Biswas provided an updated authentication scheme. First, we show that Amin and Biswas’s strategy [24] is not able to satisfy the user anonymity property and doesn’t give complete forward secrecy and mutual authen-

User registration phase

The medical server accepts registrations from anyone during this phase to gain access to medical services.
User selects 𝐼𝐷𝑗 , password 𝑃 𝑊 𝐷𝑗 , and biometric template such as fingerprint 𝑇𝑗 . Then, 𝑈𝑗 submits 𝐼𝐷𝑗 , 𝐴𝑗 , and 𝐹𝑗 through se- cure link or in person to the medical server after computing 𝐴𝑗 = ℎ(𝐼𝐷𝑗 ||𝑃 𝑊 𝐷𝑗 ) and 𝐹𝑗 = 𝐻 (𝑇𝑗 ).
Then, Medical server 𝑆  computes 𝐴𝑗 = ℎ(𝐼𝐷𝑗 ||𝑃 𝑊 𝐷𝑗 ), 𝐾 =
ℎ(𝐼 𝐷𝑠 ||𝑧||𝐼 𝐷𝑗 ), 𝐵𝑗 = ℎ(𝐼 𝐷𝑗 ||𝐴𝑗 ) ⊕ 𝐾 , 𝐶 𝐼 𝐷𝑗 = 𝐸𝑧 (𝐼 𝐷𝑗 ||𝑟) and issues
a SC for the 𝑈 after storing 𝐹 , 𝐴 , 𝐵 , 𝐶𝐼𝐷 , ℎ(⋅), 𝐻 (⋅) into the
2.5. Password change phase

It’s a useful attribute for adding a password change phase to any password-based user authentication mechanism, allowing users to change their passwords without the need for a medical server.
The 𝑈𝑗 first puts the SC into the card reader and performs steps 1 and 2 of the login phase to verify the 𝑈 ′ s authenticity. After that, the
card reader performs the procedures below to successfully change the password.
After user authentication, the card reader prompts the user to en-
ter a new password, 𝑃 𝑊 𝐷𝑛𝑒𝑤, into the 𝑈𝑗 , and after doing so,

, 𝐵𝑗



The 𝑈𝑗 can use a medical server with a card reader or terminal device
to access the medical server at any time and from any location after
successfully completing the registration procedure. The following is a list of all the steps in this phase:
The 𝑈𝑗 first embeds his or her SC into the card reader device, then embeds the biometric template 𝑇𝑗 into the sensor device. 𝐹 ∗ = 𝐻 (𝑇𝑗 ) is computed by the card reader and compared to the stored 𝐹𝑗 . Bio- metric verification is successful if it matches, and the 𝑈𝑗 is asked to input 𝐼𝐷𝑗 , 𝑃 𝑊 𝐷𝑗 ; otherwise, the connection is terminated.
𝐴∗ = ℎ(𝐼𝐷𝑗 ||𝑃 𝑊 𝐷𝑗 ) is computed by the card reader and compared

to the stored 𝐴𝑗 . The matching result determines whether or not the 𝑈𝑗 provided valid 𝐼𝐷𝑗 , 𝑃 𝑊 𝐷𝑗 . Proceed to the next stage if it
matches; Else, the connection will be canceled.
The terminal generates a nonce at random 𝑟𝑗 and calculates 𝐷1 = 𝑟𝑗 ⋅
𝑁 , 𝐾 = 𝐵𝑗 ⊕ ℎ(𝐼 𝐷𝑗 ||𝐴∗), 𝐷2 = 𝑟𝑗 ⊕ 𝐾, 𝐷4 = ℎ(𝐼𝐷𝑗 ||𝑟𝑗 ||𝐾) and sends
𝐷2 , 𝐷4 and 𝐶𝐼𝐷𝑗 over the public/open channel as a login message
to the medical server.


2.4. Authentication and key agreement phase
The 𝑈𝑗 and the medical server must establish mutual authentication and a shared session key agreement at this phase. All of the steps in this
phase are listed below:
The medical server decrypts 𝐶𝐼𝐷𝑗 using the server’s secret key 𝑧
and gets (𝐼𝐷∗||𝑟) = 𝐷𝐸𝑧 (𝐶𝐼𝐷𝑗 ), 𝐾 = ℎ(𝐼𝐷𝑠 ||𝑧||𝐼𝐷∗), 𝑟∗ = 𝐷2 ⊕ 𝐾,
This section describes the security limitations of the scheme in Amin and Biswas [24].

Adversary model

Adversary modeling is a crucial component of creating an authen- ticated protocol. A strategy for strengthening security by categorizing vulnerabilities and goals, and hence establishing protective measures against threats to the system, is known as adversary modeling. In this context, a threat could be a harmful attack carried out by an enemy, such as an adversary who could harm the resources. The adversary model is based on the assumptions below. These assumptions regarding an adver- sary’s prowess are legitimate, and they’ve been made in contemporary works as well:
The message that was communicated across the insecure communi- cation channels has little influence on the adversary. Intercepting, altering, and deleting any conveyed message are all examples of this [25–27]
Using a power analysis technique, the adversary can retrieve the security parameters encoded in the smart card [28–31].
The password dictionary can be enumerated oﬄine by adversary [32,33].

Fails to oﬀer user anonymity
Assume Adversary acquires the value 𝐴𝑗 , 𝐵𝑗 under assumption 2
from the stolen smart card, and the adversary intercepts the 𝑈𝑗 ’s lo-

𝐷∗ = 𝑟∗ ⋅ 𝑁 , 𝐷∗ = ℎ(𝐼𝐷𝑗 ||𝑟∗||𝐾) and matches 𝐷∗ with the received
gin request message (𝐷2 , 𝐶𝐼𝐷𝑗 , 𝐷4 , 𝑇𝑗 , 𝑇𝑢 ). Now, Adversary has values

1	𝑗	4	𝑗	4

𝐷4. The medical server trusts it if it matches the 𝑈𝑗 ’s legitimacy.
The medical server generates a nonce at random 𝑟𝑘 and cal-
culates 𝐷1 = 𝑟𝑘 ⋅ 𝑁 , 𝑆𝐾 = 𝑟𝑘 ⋅ 𝐷∗ = 𝑟𝑘 ⋅ 𝑟∗ ⋅ 𝑁 , 𝐽1 = 𝐻1 + 𝐷∗, 𝐿𝑗 =
(𝐴𝑗 , 𝐵𝑗 , 𝐷2 , 𝐶𝐼𝐷𝑗 , 𝐷4 , 𝑇𝑗 , 𝑇𝑢 ). Adversary can find the user 𝑈𝑗 ’s 𝐼𝐷𝑗 by
doing the following:

Amin and Biswas’s scheme fails to offer user anonymity.



Prone to offiine passsword guessing attack
Assume Adversary obtain the values {𝐴𝑗 , 𝐵𝑗 , 𝐽𝑖 , ℎ(⋅)} under assump- tion 2, the login request message is intercepted by Adversary from the
stolen/lost 𝑆𝐶 of (𝐼𝐷𝑗 , 𝐷2 , 𝐶𝐼𝐷𝑗 , 𝐷4 , 𝑇𝑗 , 𝑇𝑢 ) under assumption 1. As
previously stated, Adversary can uncover a user’s original identification
𝐼𝐷𝑗 . Adversary can perform an oﬄine password guessing attack using
these values as follows:
the authenticity of the user, but the user can also verify the server’s le- gitimacy. Furthermore, no unauthorised users or cloud servers have the ability to impersonate a legitimate user or server. An attacker can mimic a valid user, as previously stated. As a result, the mutual authentication setup is broken. As a result, mutual authentication is not achievable.
Conclusion

Adversary assumes password of the user 𝑈𝑗

as 𝑃 𝑊 𝐷𝑎 .
We investigated Amin and Biswas’s authentication technique and
found that it is not able to deliver user anonymity, mutual authenti-

Compute 𝑧𝑗 = 𝐽𝑖 ⊕ ℎ(𝐴𝑗 ⊕ 𝑃𝑊 𝐷𝑗 ) = 𝑧𝑗 ⊕ ℎ(𝐴𝑗 ⊕ 𝑃𝑊 𝐷𝑗 ) ⊕ ℎ(𝐴𝑗 ⊕
𝑃 𝑊 𝐷𝑗 ) = 𝑧𝑗 .
Compute 𝐴∗ = ℎ(𝐼𝐷𝑗 ||𝑃 𝑊 𝐷𝑎 ).
Compare 𝐴 =? 𝐴∗. If this is the case, adversary’s guessed 𝑃 𝑊 𝐷 is
correct.
If false, the adversary must repeat steps (1–4) till you get your hands on the current password.
Hence, the attacker can learn the user’s password.
The foregoing steps take 𝑂(∣ 𝐷𝑃𝑊 𝐷 ∣ ×(6𝑇𝑥𝑜𝑟 + 4𝑇ℎ )), where ∣ 𝐷𝑃𝑊 𝐷 ∣ denotes the identity space size, 𝑇𝑥𝑜𝑟 presents the XOR operation execu- tion time, and 𝑇ℎ presents the hash operation execution time. In reality, the password space is usually somewhat limited, such as ∣ 𝐷𝑃𝑊 𝐷 ∣<=

password guessing attack.

Future efforts will be fo- cused on bolstering Amin and Biswas’s scheme, which will be capable of meeting all security criteria and objectives.

As a result, since revealing the user’s password affects the secrecy of previous session keys, Amin and Biswa’s scheme doesn’t provide perfect forward secrecy.
