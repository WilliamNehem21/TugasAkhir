The concept of picture fuzzy sets (PFS) is a generalization of ordinary fuzzy sets and intuitionistic fuzzy sets, which is characterized by positive membership, neutral membership, and negative membership functions. Keeping in mind the importance of similarity measures and applications in data mining, med- ical diagnosis, decision making, and pattern recognition, several studies have been proposed in the liter- ature. Some of those, however, cannot satisfy the axioms of similarity and provide counter-intuitive cases. In this paper, we propose new similarity measures for PFSs based on two parameters t and p, where t identifies the level of uncertainty and p is the Lp norm. The properties of the bi-parametric similarity and distance measures are discussed. We provide some counterexamples for existing similarity measures in the literature and show how our proposed similarity measure is important and applicable to the pattern recognition problems. In the end, we provide an application of a proposed similarity measure for medical diagnosis.

Introduction

Many classical theories such as fuzzy set theory [1], probability theory, vague set theory [2], rough set theory [3], intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) [4], and the interval mathematics [5] are well known and effectively model uncertainties. These approaches show their inherent difficulties because of intensive quantity and type of

uncertainties as pointed out by Molodtsov [6]. In [6], Molodtsov defined the soft set which is an absolutely new logical instrument for dealing uncertainties. Nowadays, many authors work to hybri- dize the different models with the soft set and achieved results in many applicable theories. The fuzzy soft set and intuitionistic fuzzy soft set (IFSS) were defined by Maji et al. [7,8]. Then the further extensions of soft sets like the generalized fuzzy soft set [9], the interval-valued fuzzy soft set [10], the soft rough set [11], the vague soft set [12], the trapezoidal fuzzy soft set [13], the neutro- sophic soft set [14], the intuitionistic neutrosophic soft set [15], the multi-fuzzy soft set [16], and the hesitant fuzzy soft set [17] were introduced. Agarwal defined the generalized intuitionistic fuzzy soft set (GIFSS) as the cross product of IFSS and IFS [18]. Later, Feng el al. [19] pointed out that this cross product was not well defined. Feng el al. clarified and reformulated the GIFSS as the combination of an IFSS over the universe of discourse and the IFS in the parameter set. The soft decernibility matrix approach for GIFSS was used to solve decision making problems in reference [20].

In [21], Coung introduced the notion of PFS by including an extra membership; the ‘‘neutral membership degree”. The PFS is the gener- alization of fuzzy sets and IFSs [22]. Coung and Kreinovich discussed PFS for computational intelligence problems [22]. The PFS model uncertainties more effectively and directly applied to solve the daily life problems. Coung and Kreinovich explained t-norm operators for PFSs [23]. Fuzzy logic operators for PFSs were determined by Cuong and Hai [24]. Correlation coefficients of PFS and their applications in clustering analysis were introduced by Sing [25]. With the help of novel fuzzy calculations based on the PFS domain time arrange- ment gauging and climate estimating was given by Son and Thong [26]. Son [27], defined picture fuzzy separation, generalized distance and association measures, and connected them to tackle group inves- tigation under the PFS condition. Wei [28], exhibited picture fuzzy aggregation operators method and applied it to multi attribute deci- sion making (MADM) for ranking enterprise resource planning (ERP) structures. Wei [29], researched a basic leadership technique in light of the picture fuzzy weighted cross-entropy and used this to rank the choices. Garg [30], contemplated aggregation operations on PFSs and applied it to multi criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems. Pic- ture fuzzy hamarcher, geometric and Dombi aggregation operators and their applications to the MADM were demonstrated by Wei, Wang and Jana, respectively [31–33]. For more about aggregation operators of PFSs, we refer to [34–37].
Yang et al. [38] defined the hybrid model of soft set and PFS and called it picture fuzzy soft set (PFSS). The generalized picture fuzzy soft set (GPFSS) and their applications in decision making were dis- cussed by Khan et al. [39]. The soft decernibility matrix approach for PFSSs and GPFSSs approach was used to solve decision making problems [38,40]. The decernibility matrix approach is important when you have to start the process with predefined conditions on membership functions, i.e., threshold values. The applications of GPFSS in concept selection were discussed in [41].
In this paragraph, we discuss the distance and similarity mea- sures of PFSs and the methods derived based on them. The distance and similarity measures have application in data mining, medical diagnosis, decision making and pattern recognition. In [42], Wei defined the picture fuzzy cross entropy and use it for MADM prob- lems. Similarity measures for PFSs based on cosine and cotangent functions and applied them for strategic decision making [43]. Peng [44], determined an algorithm for PFS that was implemented to decision making problems. In [45], Wei interpreted cosine, weighted cosine, set theoretic, weighted set theoretic, grey and weighted grey similarity measure for picture fuzzy sets and applied them to the pattern recognition problems. Wang et al.
[46] used projection based VIKOR method for risk evaluation of construction project by using PFSs. Meksavang et al. [47] used extended VIKOR method for sustainable supplier selection using PFSs and discussed its application in beef industry. An applications of PFSs in cleaner production of gold mines by using integrated EDAS-ELECTRE was discussed by Liang [48]. Picture fuzzy TOPSIS method based on the linear programming and distance measure was discussed by Sindhu et al. [49]. The picture fuzzy entropy based similarity measures and its applications in MADM were practiced by Thao [50]. Nhung et al. [51] adopted the dissimilarity measures for PFS and discussed its applications in MADM. A pro- jection model was exercised by Wei et al. [52], in order to measure the similarity. The picture fuzzy generalized dice similarity mea- sures were presented by Wei and Gao [53]. The generalized picture distance measures and picture association measures, and their application in clustering analysis were discussed by Son [54]. Ganei et al. [55] defined some new correlation coefficients of PFSs and discussed their applications in pattern recognition, medical diagnosis and clustering analysis.
In this paragraph, we discuss the applications of IFSs and type-2 fuzzy sets in medical diagnosis. Szmidt and Kacprzyk discuss the
medical diagnosis problems using IFSs based on the similarity and distance measures [56–58]. De et al. [59] extended the San- chez’s approach for medical diagnosis using max–min-max com- position based on IFSs. The pattern recognition and medical diagnosis problems were discussed by Vlachos et al. [60] using cross-entropy in IF settings. Wei et al. [61] introduced the entropy measure for interval valued IFSs and construct similarity measures based on the proposed entropy. Then similarity measures were used to solve pattern recognition and medical diagnosis problems. The distance measures for interval values IFSs were used for med- ical diagnosis of headache in [63]. Boran and Akay introduced the bi-parametric distance and similarity measures for IFSs and dis- cussed their applications in pattern recognition and medical diag- nosis problems in [62]. In reference [64] Own studied advantages of type-2 fuzzy and switching relation between type-2 fuzzy sets and IFSs. Then the switching results are applied in medical diagno- sis. For advance study about medical diagnosis by using type-2 fuzzy sets, we refer you to [65–70].
We adopt the generalize model of fuzzy set (PFS) for medical diagnosis. The PFSs are comparatively a new extension of fuzzy sets which describe the human opinions that has more answers like acceptance, rejection, neutral and desist, which cannot be cor- rectly presented in fuzzy sets and IFSs. The PFSs are categorized by three objects, the degree of belonging (membership), the degree of neutral belonging and the degree of non-belonging (non- membership) such that the total of these three degrees must not be more than one. Basically, PFSs play an important role in situa- tions involving more types of answers like no, yes, refusal and abstain. To model such situations, a PFS is an appropriate choice.
The main contributions of our work are:

We extend the idea of bi-parametric distance and similarity measures for PFSs. The properties of the proposed similarity measures are discussed.
The interpretation of the novel distance measure and the func- tionality of level of uncertainty t are discussed.
Applications in pattern recognition for the proposed bi- parametric distance and similarity measures are discussed, as well as, the counter intuitive cases for existing distance and similarity measures are discussed.
The medical diagnosis problem is discussed based on the bi- parametric distance and similarity measures.

Some of the proposed similarity measure for PFSs has some problems which are pointed out in Section 5. To improve the idea of the similarity measure, we proposed the new similarity mea- sure based on two parameters p and t, where p is the Lp norm and t identifies the level of uncertainty. The remaining paper is organized as follows: The preliminaries are presented in Sections
In Section 3, we proposed the new distance and similarity mea- sures for PFSs. In Section 4, we give the explanation of both param- eters p and t, and interpretation of novel distance measure. In Section 5, we provide some counterexamples for already proposed similarity measures. To support the proposed similarity measure a numerical example of medical diagnosis is presented in Section 6. Comparison analysis and conclusion are presented in Sections 7 and 8.


Preliminaries

In this section, we provide some basic definitions of fuzzy set, intuitionistic fuzzy set, picture fuzzy set and some similarity measures.
A fuzzy set is defined by Zadeh [1], which handles uncertainty based on the view of gradualness effectively.

ship function, the picture fuzzy set is obtained. Basically, the model of the picture fuzzy set may be adequate in situations when we face human opinions involving more answers of the type: yes, abstain, no, refusal. Voting can be a good example of picture fuzzy set because it involves the situation of more answers of the type: yes, abstain, no, refusal.

then we have

and S^ in Y^ .

Proof. (D1) Let Α^ and S^ be two PFSs.
We can write the following equations:
|t(nΑ^ (yj)— nS^ (yj))— (gΑ^ (yj)— gS^ (yj))— (mΑ^ (yj)— mS^ (yj))|
= |(tnΑ^ (yj)— gΑ^ (yj)— mΑ^ (yj))— (tnS^ (yj)— gS^ (yj)— mS^ (yj))|,
|t(g^ (yj)— g^ (yj))— (n^ (yj)— n^ (yj))+ (m^ (yj)— m^ (yj))|
nΑ^ (yj) = nS^ (yj), gΑ^ (yj) = gS^ (yj) and mΑ^ (yj)= mS^ (yj), therefore, nΑ^ (yj)— nS^ (yj)= 0, gΑ^ (yj)— gS^ (yj) = 0 and mΑ^ (yj)— mS^ (yj) = 0. Therefore, the distance measure is equal to zero.
(D3) For two PFSs Α^ and S^, we can write the following equations:
Α( )— S ( ))— ( Α( )— S ( ))— ( Α( )— S ( ))|
= |(—1){t(nS^ (yj)— nΑ^ (yj))— (gS^ (yj)— gΑ^ (yj)) — (mS^ (yj)
— m^ (y ))}|p ,

Α	S	Α	S	Α	S	Α  j

= |(tgΑ^ (yj)+ mΑ^ (yj)— nΑ^ (yj))— (tgS^ (yj)) + mS^ (yj)— nS^ (yj))|,
|t(mΑ^ (yj)— mS^ (yj))— (nΑ^ (yj)— nS^ (yj))+ (gΑ^ (yj)— gS^ (yj))|
= |(tm^ (yj)+ g^ (yj)— n^ (yj))— (tm^ (yj)) + g^ (yj)— n^ (yj))|.
|t(g^ (yj)— g^ (yj))— (n^ (yj)— n^ (yj))+ (m^ (yj)— m^ (yj))|p
= |(—1){t(gS^ (yj)— gΑ^ (yj))— (nS^ (yj)— nΑ^ (yj)) + (mS^ (yj)
— m^ (y ))}|p ,

Since from the definition of PFS, we have 0 6 nΑ^ (yj) 6

0 6 mS^ (yj) 6 1, and therefore we have the following inequalities:
—1 6 (tnΑ^ (yj)— gΑ^ (yj)— mΑ^ (yj)) 6 t
—t 6 —(tnS^ (yj)— gS^ (yj)— mS^ (yj)) 6 1
then we have
= |(—1){t(mS^ (yj)— mΑ^ (yj))— (nS^ (yj)— nΑ^ (yj))+ (gS^ (yj)
— g^ (yj))}|p.
Based on the definition of absolute value, we have
|t(n^ (yj)— n^ (yj))— (g^ (yj)— g^ (yj))— (m^ (yj)— m^ (yj))|p

Α	S	Α	S	Α	S

It means that
0 6 |(tn^ (yj)— g^ (yj)— m^ (yj))— (tn^ (yj)— g^ (yj)— m^ (yj))|p

Similarly, we have the following inequalities:
— m^ (y ))}|p ,	(6)

|t(m^ (yj)— m^ (yj))— (n^ (yj)— n^ (yj))+ (g^ (yj)— g^ (yj))|p

—1 6 (tg^ (yj)+ m^ (yj)— n^ (yj)) 6 t

= |{t(mS^ (yj)— mΑ^ (yj))— (nS^ (yj)— nΑ^ (yj))+ (gS^ (yj)
— g (y ))}|p.	(7)

then we have
Α^  j


Thus, Ð^ (Α^ , S^) = Ð^ (S^, Α^ ).
|(tm^ (yj)+ g^ (yj)— n^ (yj))— (tm^(yj)) + g^(yj)— n^(yj))|p

(D4) Let Α^ , S^ and C^ are three PFSs. The distance between Α^ and
S^, and Α^ and C^ are the following:
P |(tmΑ^ (yj)+ gΑ^ (yj)— nΑ^ (yj))— (tmS^ (yj)) + gS^ (yj)

Clearly, Α^ – S^ but CS1(Α^ , S^) = 1. Hence CS1 is not effective for these cases and not reliable to find the similarity measure between PFSs. But when we find the similarity measure from proposed bi- parametric similarity  measure  with  t = 3  and  p = 2,  we  get

To obtain distance measure and the reliability of the proposed method, we replace the negative sign from positive sign in second and third term in Eq. (17) for neutral membership function
Our aimed to find out the class of unknown pattern P belongs to. When we use set theoretic similarity measure STM (Definition 2.10),  we  get  the  same  similarity  measure  i.e., STM(P, Q 1) = STM(P, Q 2)= 0.5. Hence in this case we can’t decide the class of unknown pattern P. But when we find the similarity

t = 3	and	p = 2,	we	get	Sp(P, Q 1) = 0.907298	and
Sp(P, Q 2) = 0.870163.  Since  Sp(P, Q 1) > Sp(P, Q 2),  therefore,  the

labels Z1 and Z2, respectively, are given. The PFSs are used to repre- sents the patterns in Y^ = {y1, y2 , y3} as follows:
Q 1  = {(0.3, 0.2, 0.1)/y1, (0.5, 0.1, 0.2)/y2 , (0.6, 0.1, 0.3)/y3 }
Q 2  = {(0.6, 0.1, 0.3)/y1, (0.1, 0.2, 0.5)/y2 , (0.6, 0.3, 0.1)/y3 }.
P is the unknown pattern which is given as follows:
P = {(0.5, 0.3, 0.2)/y1, (0.3, 0.4, 0.2)/y2, (0.4, 0.3, 0.2)/y3}.
Our aimed to find out the class of unknown pattern P belongs to. When we use cosine similarity measure CS2 (Definition 2.4), we get  the  same  similarity  measure  i.e.,  CS2(P, Q 1)= CS2(P, Q 2)= 0.93104. Hence in this case we can’t decide the class of unknown pattern P. Also when we use the cotangent similarity measure CS4, we get the same similarity measures i.e., CS4(P, Q 1)= CS4(P, Q 2)= 0.688629. Hence in this case we can’t decide the class of unknown pattern P by using cotangent similarity
measure CS4. The bi-parametric similarity measure successfully applies for t = 3 and p = 2. We get Sp(P, Q 1)= 0.844098 and Sp(P, Q 2)= 0.864087. Since Sp(P, Q 2) > Sp(P, Q 1), therefore, the
P is the unknown pattern which is given as follows:
P = {(0.5, 0.3, 0.2)/y1, (0.3, 0.4, 0.2)/y2, (0.4, 0.3, 0.2)/y3}.
Our aimed to find out the class of unknown pattern P belongs to. But when we use cosine similarity measure CS5 with degree of refusal membership (Definition 2.7), we get the same similarity measure i.e., CS5(P, Q 1)= CS5(P, Q 2)= 0.93104. Also when we use the cotan- gent similarity measure CS6 with degree of refusal membership (Definition 2.8), we get the same similarity measures i.e., CS6(P, Q 1)= CS6(P, Q 2)= 0.688629. Hence in this case we can’t decide the class of unknown pattern P by using cotangent similarity measure CS6 with degree of refusal membership function. Hence in this case we can’t decide the class of unknown pattern P. But when
we find the similarity measure from proposed bi-parametric simi- larity measure with t = 3 and p = 2, we get Sp(P, Q 1)= 0.844098 and Sp(P, Q 2)= 0.864087. Since Sp(P, Q 2) > Sp(P, Q 1), therefore, the
unknown pattern P belongs to class Z2.

Example 5.4. Let Q 1 and Q 2 be two known patterns with class labels Z1 and Z2, respectively, are given. The PFSs are used to repre- sents the patterns in Y^ = {y1, y2 , y3} as follows:

Q 2  = {(0.6, 0.1, 0.3)/y1, (0.1, 0.3, 0.4)/y2, (0.3, 0.1, 0.2)/y3}.
P is the unknown pattern which is given as follows:

Our aimed to find out the class of unknown pattern P belongs to. But when we use cosine similarity measure CS3 (Definition 2.5), we get the same similarity measure i.e., CS3(P, Q 1)= CS3(P, Q 2) =0.941998. Hence in this case we can’t decide the class of unknown pattern P. But when we find the similarity measure from proposed bi- parametric similarity measure with t = 3 and p = 2, we get
Sp(P, Q 1)= 0.836064 and Sp(P, Q 2)= 0.876678. Since Sp(P, Q 2) >

For a proper diagnosis, we calculated similarity measure between patients and diagnosis in the context of symptoms. For all diagnosis this process is done. If similarity measure is high then the patient suffer from that particular disease. The similarity mea- sure between patients and diagnosis is presented in Table 3. According to the similarity measure in Table 3, Joy suffers from Stomach problem, Pob suffers from Heart problem, Aya suffers from Viral fever and Ted suffers from Stomach problem.

For different values of p, we have seen that the values of similarity measures decreases when we increase the value of p but the order of the diagnosis remains same. From Fig. 2, we have seen that the graph for p = 2 remains above and for p = 8 remains lower. No graph intersect or cut each other
and hence consistent and reliable for all value of p. This shows that if we increase or decrease the value for p, we get the same diagno- sis (order). For different values of t, we get the same diagnosis but their value depends on the data because t identifies the level of uncertainty and purely depends on the data set that we have provided.

Comparison analysis

A comparison between bi-parametric similarity measure and already proposed similarity measure is conducted to illustrate the superiority of the bi-parametric similarity measure.
We have seen from Example 5.1 that the second condition of Definition 3.2 (S2) is not satisfied for cosine similarity measure CS1, i.e., £^(Α^ , S^) = 1 even Α^ – S^. Also we provide a general criteria when second condition of Definition 3.2 (S2) is not satisfied for
cosine similarity measure CS1. In Example 5.2, we have seen that the STM can not classify the unknown pattern and i.e., STM(P, Q 1) = STM(P, Q 2) even Q 1 – Q 2. In Example 5.3, we have seen that the CS2 can not classify the unknown pattern i.e., CS2(P, Q 1)= CS2(P, Q 2) even Q 1 – Q 2. Also in Example 5.3, we have seen that the similarity measure CS4 fails to classify unknown pat-
tern i.e., CS4(P, Q 1) = CS4(P, Q 2) even Q 1 – Q 2. In Example 5.4, we
have seen that the CS3 can not classify the unknown pattern and i.e., CS3(P, Q 1) = CS3(P, Q 2) even Q 1 – Q 2. In Example 5.5, we have seen that the CS5 can not classify the unknown pattern i.e., CS5(P, Q 1)= CS5(P, Q 2) even Q 1 – Q 2. Also in Example 5.5, we have seen that the similarity measure CS6 fails to classify unknown pat- tern i.e., CS6(P, Q 1)= CS6(P, Q 2) even Q 1 – Q 2. But in all Examples
5.1–5.5, the bi-parametric similarity measure classify the unknown pattern and hence successfully applicable to the pattern recogni-
tion problems. Also in medical diagnosis problems CS2 and CS4
can not diagnosis Aya (see Table 4).
A comprehensive comparison with the existing similarity mea- sures is discussed by considering four cases. In first case, suppose A = (0.4, 0.4, 0.2), B = (0.2, 0.2, 0.1) and C = (0.3, 0.1, 0.1) be three
distinct PFVs. We have calculated the similarity measure between A and B, as well as, A and C. The second condition for similarity measure is not satisfied for CS1, i.e., A – B but CS1(A, B) = 1. The similarity measures CS3, CS5, CS6, CS7 and STS have no capabilities to distinguish between the PFVs B and C from the PFV A perspec- tive.  In  second  case,  we  suppose  D = (0.5, 0.3, 0.2), E = (0.3, 0.2, 0.1)) and F = (0.6, 0.1, 0.3) be three distinct PFVs. The similarity measures CS2, CS3 and CS4 have no capabilities to distin- guish between the PFVs E and F from the PFV D perspective. Simi- larly, in third case, the PFVs G = (0.5, 0.3, 0.2), H = (0.3, 0.2, 0.1)) and I = (0.6, 0.1, 0.3) are considered. All the previously proposed similarity measures for PFSs have no capabilities to distinguish
between the PFVs H and I from the PFV G perspective. The fourth case  consist  of  two  distinct  PFVs  K = (0.2, 0.2, 0.2), L = (0.3, 0.3, 0.3) but CS1(K, L)= 1. The bi-parametric similarity mea- sure remains consistent for all cases and gave us a satisfactory results. The summary of the four cases presented in Table 6.



Conclusion

In this paper, we have proposed new similarity measures for PFSs called bi-parametric similarity measures based on two param- eters t and p, where t is the level of uncertainty and p is the Lp norm. We have defined bi-parametric distance measures, weighted bi-parametric distance measures, bi-parametric similarity mea- sures and weighted bi-parametric similarity measures and dis- cussed their properties. Also, we discussed the comprehensive interpretation of the proposed similarity measure. We discuss some special cases ((5.1)–(5.5)), where already proposed similarity measure fails to classify the unknown pattern while the proposed similarity measure successfully applied to the pattern recognition problems. A numerical example is proposed to solve medical diag- nosis problems and we have seen that the results are consistent and does not change with the values of the parameters (See Table 5 and Fig. 2).
In the future direction, we will apply the bi-parametric similar- ity measure to data mining, medical diagnosis, decision making, complex group decision making, linguistic summarization risk analysis, pattern recognition, clustering analysis, image processing and image restoration problems.
