First-order methods for solving convex optimization problems have been at the forefront of mathematical opti- mization in the last 20 years. The rapid development of this important class of algorithms is motivated by the success stories reported in various applications, including most importantly machine learning, signal process- ing, imaging and control theory. First-order methods have the potential to provide low accuracy solutions at low computational complexity which makes them an attractive set of tools in large-scale optimization problems. In this survey, we cover a number of key developments in gradient-based optimization methods. This includes non-Euclidean extensions of the classical proximal gradient method, and its accelerated versions. Additionally we survey recent developments within the class of projection-free methods, and proximal versions of primal- dual schemes. We give complete proofs for various key results, and highlight the unifying aspects of several optimization algorithms.





Introduction

The traditional standard in convex optimization was to trans- late a problem into a conic program and solve it using a primal- dual interior point method (IPM). The monograph Nesterov and Ne- mirovski (1994) was instrumental in setting this standard. The primal- dual formulation is a mathematically elegant and powerful approach as these conic problems can then be solved to high accuracy when the di- mension of the problem is of moderate size. This philosophy culminated into the development of a robust technology for solving convex opti- mization problems which is nowadays the computational backbone of many specialized solution packages like MOSEK (Andersen and Ander- sen, 2000), or SeDuMi (Sturm, 1999). However, in general, the iteration
mension. As a result, as the dimension 𝑛 of optimization problems grows, costs of interior point methods grow non-linearly with the problem’s di-
off-the shelve interior point methods eventually become impractical. As an illustration, the computational complexity of a single step of many
standardized IPMs scales like 𝑛3, corresponding roughly to the complex-
ity of inverting an 𝑛 × 𝑛 matrix. This means that for already quite small problems of size like 𝑛 = 102, we would need roughly 106 arithmetic op-
erations just to compute a single iterate. From a practical viewpoint, such a scaling is not acceptable. An alternative solution approach, par- ticularly attractive for such ”large-scale” problems, are first-order meth- ods (FOMs). These are iterative schemes with computationally cheap iterations usually known to yield low-precision solutions within reason- able computation time. The success-story of FOMs went hand-in-hand with the fast progresses made in data science, analytics and machine learning. In such data-driven optimization problems, the trade-off be- tween fast iterations and low accuracy is particularly pronounced, as these problems usually feature high-dimensional decision variables. In these application domains precision is usually considered to be a sub- ordinate goal because of the inherent randomness of the problem data, which makes it unreasonable to minimize with accuracy below the sta- tistical error.
The development of first-order methods for convex optimization problems is still a very vibrant field, with a lot of stimulus from the

already mentioned applications in machine learning, statistics, optimal control, signal processing, imaging, and many more, see e.g. the recent review papers on optimization for machine learning (Bottou et al., 2018; Jain and Kar, 2017; Wright, 2018). Naturally, any attempt to try to sur- vey this lively scientific field is already doomed from the beginning to be a failure, if one is not willing to make restrictions on the topics cov- ered. Hence, in this survey we tried to give a largely self-contained and concise summary of some important families of FOMs, which we believe have had an ever-lasting impact on the modern perspective of continu- ous optimization. Before we give an outline of what is covered in this survey, it is therefore fair to mention explicitly, what is NOT covered in the pages to come. One major restriction we imposed on ourselves is the concentration on deterministic optimization algorithms. This is in- deed a significant cut in terms of topics, since the field of stochastic op- timization and randomized algorithms has particularly been at the fore- front of recent progresses made. Nonetheless, we intentionally made this cut, since most of the developments within stochastic optimization al- gorithms are based on deterministic counterparts, and actually in many cases one can think of deterministic algorithms as the mean-field equiv- alent of a stochastic optimization technique. As a well-known example, we can mention the celebrated stochastic approximation theory initi- ated by Robbins and Monro (1951), with its close connection to deter- ministic gradient descent. See Benveniste et al. (1990); Kushner (1984); Ljung et al. (2012), for classical references from the point of view of systems theory and optimization, and Benaïm, 1998 for its deep con- nection with deterministic dynamical systems. This link has gained sig- nificant relevance in various stochastic optimization models recently (Davis et al., 2020; Duchi and Ruan, 2018; Mertikopoulos and Staudigl,
timization, mainly because of its good scalability properties and small iteration costs. Conceptually, it is an interesting optimization method, as it allows us to solve convex programming problems with complicated geometry on which proximal operators are not easy to evaluate. This, in fact, applies to many important domains, like the Spectrahedron, or domains defined via intersections of several half spaces. CG is also rele- vant when the iterates should preserve structural features of the desired solution, like sparsity. Section 5 gives a comprehensive account of this versatile method.
All the methods we discussed so far generally provide sublinear con-
ity of 𝑂(1∕𝜀). In his influential paper (Nesterov, 1983), Nesterov pub- vergence guarantees in terms of function values with iteration complex- lished an optimal method with iteration complexity of 𝑂(1∕ 𝜀) to reach an 𝜀-optimal solution. This was the starting point for the development
of acceleration techniques for given FOMs. Section 6 summarizes the recent developments in this field.
With writing this survey, we tried to give a holistic presentation of the main methods in use. At various stages in the survey, we establish connections, if not equivalences, between various methods. For many of the key results we provide self-contained proofs.
Notation We use standard notation and concepts from convex and variational analysis, which, unless otherwise specified, can all be found in the monographs (Bauschke and Combettes, 2016; Hiriart-Urrut and

ferent optimization algorithms are surveyed, all of which belong now to the standard toolkit of mathematical programmers. After introduc- ing the (standard) notation that will be used in this survey, we give a precise formulation of the model problem for which modern convex optimization algorithms are developed. In particular, we focus on the general composite convex optimization model, including smooth and non-smooth terms. This model is rich enough to capture a significant class of convex optimization problems. Non-smoothness is an impor- tant feature of the model, as it allows us to incorporate constraints via penalty and barrier functions. Non-smooth optimization methods also gained a lot of attention in statistical and machine learning where regu- larization functions are usually included in the estimation part in order to promote sparsity or other a-priori relevant information about the es- timator to be obtained. An eﬃcient way to deal with non-smoothness is provided by the use of proximal operators, a key methodological contri- bution born within convex analysis (see Rockafellar and Wets (1998) for an historical overview). Section 3 introduces the general non-Euclidean proximal setup, which describes the mathematical framework within which the celebrated Mirror Descent and Bregman proximal gradient meth- ods are analyzed nowadays. These tools achieved extreme popularity in online learning and convex optimization (Bubeck, 2015; Juditsky and Nemirovski, 2011a; 2011b). The main idea behind this technology is to exploit favorable structure in the problem’s geometry to boost the prac- tical performance of gradient-based methods. The proximal revolution has also influenced the further development of primal-dual optimization methods based on augmented Lagrangians. We review proximal variants of the celebrated Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) in Section 4. We then move on to give an in-depth presentation of projection-free optimization methods based on linear minimization ora-

𝑓 ∶ 𝖵 → ℝ is convex and continuously differentiable on a neighbor- hood of 𝖷. Furthermore, it possesses a 𝐿𝑓 -Lipschitz continuous gra-

𝑟 ∈ Γ0(𝖵) and 𝜇-strongly convex on 𝖵 for some 𝜇 ≥ 0 with respect to a norm ⋅ on 𝖵. This means that for all 𝑥, 𝑦 ∈ dom 𝑟, and any selection 𝑟 (𝑥) ∈ 𝜕𝑟(𝑥), we have
𝑟(𝑦) ≥ 𝑟(𝑥) + 𝑟′(𝑥), 𝑦 − 𝑥 + 𝜇 𝑥 − 𝑦 2.

If 𝜇 = 0 then the function 𝑟 is called convex.
We are interested in problems which are feasible.
Assumption 2. dom 𝑟 ∩ 𝖷 ≠ ∅.
In many recent applications, the smooth function 𝑓 represents a data fidelity term and the non-smooth part 𝑟 takes the role of a penalty func- tion or regularizer. The most important examples of function 𝑟 are as
follows:

Wajs (2005). This led to a rich interplay between convex programming on the one hand and machine learning and signal/image processing on the other hand. Indeed, several work-horse models in these application domains are of the composite type
Ψ(𝑥) = 𝑔(𝐀𝑥) + 𝑟(𝑥)	(2.7)
where 𝑔 ∶ 𝖤 → ℝ is a smooth function defined on a finite-dimensional set 𝖤 (usually of lower dimension than 𝖵), and 𝐀 ∈ B𝖫(𝖵, 𝖤) is bounded linear operator mapping points 𝑥 ∈ 𝖵 to elements 𝐀𝑥 ∈ 𝖤. Convexity al-
lows us to switch between primal and dual formulations freely, so that the above problem can be equivalently considered as a convex-concave minimax problem

Such minimax formulations have been of key importance in signal pro- cessing and machine learning (Juditsky et al., 2013; Juditsky and Ne- mirovski, 2011b), game theory (Sorin, 2000), decomposition methods (Tseng, 1991) and its very recent innovation around generative adver-

In the context of the composite optimization problem (P), a classical

and very powerful idea is to construct numerical optimization meth- ods by exploiting problem structure. Following this philosophy, we de-

Given the standing hypothesis on the functions 𝑓 and 𝑟, it is easy
to see that 𝖷∗ is always a closed convex set. Moreover, if 𝜇 > 0, then problem (P) is strongly convex, and so 𝖷∗ is a singleton.
Optimality conditions for problem (P) can be formulated using dif- ferential calculus tools from convex analysis. (P) can be treated as an
linearization of the smooth part, the non-smooth part 𝑟 ∈ Γ0(𝖵), and a termine the position of the next iterate by minimizing the sum of the quadratic regularization term with weight 𝛾 > 0:

by the non-smooth penalty 𝛿𝖷. Our main problem becomes then
min(𝑓 (𝑥) + 𝑟(𝑥) + 𝛿 (𝑥)).	(2.4)

Fermat’s rule says that 𝑥∗ ∈ 𝖵 is a solution to (2.4) if and only if 0 ∈
𝜕Ψ(𝑥∗) + 𝖭𝖢𝖷(𝑥∗) (Rockafellar and Wets (1998, Theorem 8.15)). In gen-

𝑥+ (𝛾) = argmin {𝛾𝜙(𝑢) + 1 ‖𝑢 − (𝑥 − 𝛾∇𝑓 (𝑥))‖2 }.	(3.2)

and 𝑓 is smooth on a neighborhood containing 𝖷 (Assumptions 1(b)). Hence, by Rockafellar and Wets (1998, Exercise 8.8c), we have 𝜕Ψ(𝑥∗) =
∇𝑓 (𝑥∗) + 𝜕𝑟(𝑥∗). Therefore, Fermat’s optimality condition becomes
0 ∈ ∇𝑓 (𝑥∗) + 𝜕𝑟(𝑥∗) + 𝖭𝖢𝖷(𝑥∗).	(2.5)
This means that there exists 𝜉 ∈ 𝜕𝑟(𝑥∗) such that

finite constant on 𝖷 (say 0 for concreteness), then the rule (3.2) is nothing else than the Euclidean projection of the directional vector

turns the classical projected gradient step 𝑥+(𝛾) = 𝑃𝖷(𝑥 − 𝛾∇𝑓 (𝑥)), where

The structured composite optimization problem (P) has attracted a lot of interest in convex programming over the last 20 years moti- vated by a number of important applications, see, e.g. Combettes and

𝖷. A fundamental idea, going back to Moreau (1965), is to define the
proximity operator Prox𝜙 ∶ 𝖵 → 𝖵 associated with a function 𝜙 ∈ Γ0(𝖵)

Remark 3.1. The classical Moreau proximity operator of 𝜙 is, in gen- eral, explicitly computable when 𝜙 is norm like, or when 𝜙 is the in-
dicator function of sets whose geometry is favorable to Euclidean pro- jections. Although quite frequent in applications (orthant, second-order
cone, 𝓁1 norm), these prox-friendly functions are very scarce, see, e.g.,
Combettes and Wajs (2005, Section 2.6). A significant improvement will
be made in Section 3.2, where a general Bregman proximal framework will be introduced.
The value function

features of the set 𝖷.

Definition 3.1. Let 𝖷 be a closed convex subset of 𝖵. We say that ℎ ∈ Γ0(𝖵) is a distance generating function (DGF) with modulus 𝛼 > 0 with

In the context of minimization the composite model Ψ = 𝑓 + 𝑟, the
gradient-based methods. Choosing 𝜙 = 𝑟 + 𝛿F in (3.3), and replacing the proximity operator is the key actor in generating a large family of generic input with the specific input 𝑥 − 𝛾∇𝑓 (𝑥), we are in the frame-
work of the Proximal Gradient Method (PGM). PGM is a very powerful method which received enormous interest in optimization and its ap- plications. For a survey in the context of signal processing we refer the reader to Combettes and Pesquet (2011). A general survey on proximal operators can be found in Beck (2017); Parikh and Boyd (2014).
We denote by  (𝖷) the set of DGFs on 𝖷.

(1970, Section 23-25), we know that dom(𝜕ℎ) ⊂ dom ℎ. Hence, 𝖷◦ = From classical differential theory of convex functions Rockafellar dom(𝜕ℎ) ∩ 𝖷 is contained in the set dom ℎ ∩ 𝖷, which in turn agrees with
𝖷 thanks to property (b). Restricted to 𝖷◦ the DGF ℎ is continuously

Hence, 𝐷ℎ(𝑥, 𝑥) = 0 for 𝑥 ∈ dom(𝜕ℎ), but in general it is not a symmetric
function and it does not satisfy a triangle inequality. This disqualifies
𝐷ℎ from carrying the label of a metric, but it can still be interpreted as
a distance measure.

Assumption 1(a) gives rise to the the classical ”descent Lemma” (Nesterov, 2018b):

Additionally, for all 𝑢 ∈ 𝖷, differential convexity of 𝑓 on 𝖵 implies (cf.
(1.1))
𝑓 (𝑢) ≥ 𝑓 (𝑥) + ∇𝑓 (𝑥), 𝑢 − 𝑥 .	(3.16)
This allows us to bound
𝑓 (𝑥), 𝑢 − 𝑥+ = ∇𝑓 (𝑥), 𝑥 − 𝑥+ + ∇𝑓 (𝑥), 𝑢 − 𝑥
In the previous subsections we focused on the setting of problem
(P) with smooth part 𝑓 and obtained for BPGM a convergence rate
𝑂(1∕𝑘). The same method actually works for non-smooth convex op- timization problems when 𝑓 has bounded subgradients In this setting BPGM with a different choice of the step-size (𝛾𝑘 )𝑘 is known as the Mir-
ror Descent (MD) method (Nemirovski and Yudin, 1983). A version of this method for convex composite non-smooth optimization was pro- posed in Duchi et al. (2010), and an overview of Subgradient/Mirror Descent type of methods for non-smooth problems can be found in Beck (2017); Dvurechensky et al. (2020b); Lan (2020). The main dif- ference between BPGM and MD is that one replaces the assumption that
∇𝑓 is Lipschitz continuous with the assumption that 𝑓 is subdifferen-
tiable with bounded subgradients, i.e. 𝑓 ′(𝑥)   𝑀  for all 𝑥 ∈ 𝖷 and

policy like 𝛾𝑘 ∼ 𝑘−1∕2. Under such a specification, the MD sequence (𝑥𝑘)𝑘 A typical choice for the step size sequence is a monotonically decreasing can be shown to converge with rate 𝑂(1∕ 𝑘) to the solution, which
is optimal in this setting. A proof of this result can be patterned via a suitable adaption of the arguments employed in our analysis of the Dual Averaging Method in Section 3.4.

Potential Improvements due to relative smoothness
A key pillar of the complexity analysis of BPGM was the descent inequality (3.15), which is available thanks to the as-
sumed Lipschitz continuity of the gradient ∇𝑓 . The influential work
Bauschke et al. (2016) introduced a very clever construction which al-
lows one to relax this restrictive assumption.2 The elegant observation
The first important observation is an extended version of the fundamen- tal inequality (3.17), which reads as
𝛾(Ψ(𝑥+) − Ψ(𝑢)) ≤ 𝐷 (𝑢, 𝑥) − 𝐷 (𝑢, 𝑥+) − (1 − 𝛾𝐿ℎ )𝐷 (𝑥+, 𝑥) ∀𝑢 ∈ dom ℎ ∩ 𝖷.	(3.21)
The derivation of this inequality is analogous to inequality (3.17), re- placing the Lipschitz-gradient-based descent inequality (3.15) by the
relative smoothness inequality (3.19) with parameter 𝐿ℎ . The contin-
introduction of the symmetry coefficient of the DGF ℎ as uation of the proof differs then in one important aspect. It relies on the
( ) ∶= inf	𝐷ℎ(𝑥, 𝑢) (	) ∈  ◦ ×  ◦	≠

The symmetry coeﬃcient 𝜈(ℎ) is confined to the interval [0,1], and
𝜈(ℎ) = 1 applies essentially only to the energy function ℎ(𝑥) = 1 𝑥 2.

made in Bauschke et al. (2016) is that the Lipschitz-gradient-based de- scent lemma has the equivalent, but insightful, expression
( 𝐿𝑓 ‖𝑥‖2 − 𝑓 (𝑥)) − ( 𝐿𝑓 ‖𝑢‖2 − 𝑓 (𝑢)) ≥ ⟨𝐿 𝑢 − ∇𝑓 (𝑢), 𝑥 − 𝑢⟩	∀𝑥, 𝑢 ∈ 𝖵.

Remark 3.6. For ℎ ∈ £(𝖷), it is true that 𝖷◦ ⊆ int(dom ℎ) ∩ 𝖷.
Based on the general intuition we have gained while working with a general proximal setup, a very tempting and natural generalization is the following.
Definition  3.6  (Relative  Smoothness,  (Bauschke  et  al.,  2016;
Comparing the constants in the complexity estimates of NoLips and BPGM we see that the relative eﬃciency of the two methods depends on
2𝐿ℎ ∕(1+𝜈(ℎ))

ous gradient), exploiting the idea of relative smoothness might lead to superior performance of NoLips.

”reciprocity” conditions on the Bregman divergence must be imposed.
Assumption 6. The DGF ℎ ∈ £(𝖷) satisfies the Bregman reciprocity con-

Rearranging terms, a very concise and elegant way of writing the
dition: The level sets {𝑢 ∈ 𝖷◦ 𝐷 (𝑢, 𝑥) ≤ 𝛽} are bounded for all 𝛽 ∈ ℝ,
and 𝑥𝑘 → 𝑥 ∈ 𝖷◦ if and only if lim𝑘→∞ 𝐷ℎ(𝑥, 𝑥𝑘) = 0.

relative smoothness condition is 𝐷𝐿ℎ ℎ 𝑓
𝑓
(𝑢, 𝑥) ≥ 0 on 𝖷◦. This amounts

This assumption is necessary, as in some settings Bregman reci-

to saying that 𝐿ℎ ℎ − 𝑓 is convex on 𝖷◦. Clearly, if 𝑓 and ℎ are twice
𝑓	◦	procity is violated. See Example 4.1 in Doljansky and Teboulle (1998) as

continuously differentiable on 𝖷 , the relative smoothness condition can be stated in terms of a positive semi-definitness condition on the set 𝖷◦ as
𝐿ℎ ∇2ℎ(𝑥) − ∇2𝑓 (𝑥) ⪰ 0   ∀𝑥 ∈ 𝖷◦.	(3.20)
Beside providing a non-Euclidean version of the descent lemma, the no- tion of relative smoothness allows us to rigorously apply gradient meth- ods to problems whose smooth part admits no global Lipschitz continu- ous gradient. This gains relevance in solving various classes of inverse problems under Poisson noise (see Section 5.2 in Bauschke et al. (2016)), and optimal experimental design (Lu et al., 2018), a class of problems structurally equivalent to finding the minimum volume ellipsoid con- taining a list of vectors (Boyd and Vandenberghe, 2004; Todd, 2016).
Assumption 5. There exists a DGF ℎ ∈ £(𝖷) for which (𝑓, ℎ) is a rela-

Dual Averaging

An alternative method called Dual Averaging (DA) was proposed in Nesterov (2009) and, on the contrary, is a primal-dual method making alternating updates in the space of gradients and in the space of iterates.

We have thus shown that DA and BPGM/MD agree if all parameters and initial conditions are chosen in the same way.

On the connection between Dual Averaging and Mirror Descent
A deep and important connection between the Dual Averaging and Mirror Descent algorithms for convex non-smooth optimization has been observed in Beck and Teboulle (2003). To relate these iterates to BPGM,
we assume that ℎ ∈  (𝖷), in the sense of Definition 3.5. Let us recall
that ℎ is essentially smooth if and only if its Fenchel conjugate ℎ∗ is es- sentially smooth. Moreover, ∇ℎ ∶ int(dom ℎ) → int(dom ℎ∗) is a bijection
with
(∇ℎ)−1 = ∇ℎ∗ and ∇ℎ∗(∇ℎ(𝑥)) = 𝑥, ∇ℎ(𝑥) − ℎ(𝑥)	(3.33)
Since 𝖷 = cl(dom ℎ), it follows
dom 𝜕ℎ = int(dom ℎ) = int(𝖷) with 𝜕ℎ(𝑥) = {∇ℎ(𝑥)}  ∀𝑥 ∈ int(𝖷).
𝜂(𝑡) ≡ 1. Differentiating the previous equation with respect to time 𝑡
gives
𝑥′(𝑡) = ∇2 ℎ∗(𝑦(𝑡))𝑦′(𝑡) = −𝜆(𝑡)∇2 ℎ∗(𝑦(𝑡))∇𝑓 (𝑥(𝑡)).
ing ∇ℎ∗(∇ℎ(𝑥)) = 𝑥 for all 𝑥 ∈ int dom ℎ (cf. (3.33)). Differentiating im- To make headway, recall the basic properties of Legendre function say- plicitly this identity, we obtain ∇2 ℎ∗(∇ℎ(𝑥))  Id, or
∇2 ℎ∗(∇ℎ(𝑥)) = [∇2 ℎ(𝑥)]−1 =∶ 𝐻 (𝑥)−1 .	(3.35)
As in Section 3.4.1, it holds true that 𝑦(𝑡) = ∇ℎ(𝑥(𝑡)) for all 𝑡 ≥ 0, we
therefore obtain the interesting characterization of the primal trajectory
as
𝑥′(𝑡) = −𝜆(𝑡)𝐻 (𝑥(𝑡))−1 ∇𝑓 (𝑥(𝑡)).
If 𝖷 is a smooth manifold, we can define a Riemannian metric
𝑔 (𝑢, 𝑣) ∶= 𝐻 (𝑥)𝑢, 𝑣	∀(𝑥, 𝑢, 𝑣) ∈ 𝖷◦ × 𝖵 × 𝖵.
The gradient of a smooth function 𝜙 with respect to the metric 𝑔 is then given by ∇𝑔 𝜙(𝑥) = 𝐻 (𝑥)−1 ∇𝜙(𝑥). Hence, the continuous-time version of

inf {Φ(𝑥, 𝑧) = 𝑔(𝑧) + 𝑟(𝑥) 𝐀𝑥 − 𝑧 = 0, 𝑥 ∈ 𝖷, 𝑧 ∈ 𝖹},	(4.1)
where 𝖷 = ℝ𝑛 and 𝖹 = ℝ𝑚. We will call this the primal problem. The
Lagrangian associated to (4.1) is
𝐿(𝑥, 𝑧, 𝑦) = 𝑔(𝑧) + 𝑟(𝑥) + 𝑦, 𝐀𝑥 − 𝑧 ,

Suppose that in (3.37) we take 𝑄(𝑦) = 𝑦, 𝜂(𝑡) = 1. This corresponds to the	⟨	⟩

straint. The dual function is accordingly defined as
𝑞(𝑦) = inf 𝐿(𝑥, 𝑧, 𝑦) = inf {𝑔(𝑧) − 𝑦, 𝑧 } + inf {𝑟(𝑥) + 𝐀𝑥, 𝑦 }

Combining the primal and the dual trajectory, we easily derive a purely primal second-order in time dynamical system given by

More generally, suppose that ℎ is a twice continuously differentiable

𝑥′′(𝑡) + (𝛾(𝑡) − 𝛾′(𝑡) )𝑥′(𝑡) + 𝛾(𝑡)𝜆(𝑡)(∇2 ℎ)−1 (𝑄(𝑦(𝑡)))∇𝑓 (𝑥(𝑡)) = 0.
Using the identity (3.35), as well as 𝑥′(𝑡) + 𝑥(𝑡) = ∇ℎ∗(𝑦(𝑡)), it follows
that
A classical implicit method for solving this minimization problem is the
proximal point method:

where 𝑐 > 0 is a regularization parameter controlling the effects of the quadratic penalty term. By Fermat’s optimality condition, the point 𝑦𝑘+1

This means that there exists 𝑥𝑘+1 ∈ 𝜕𝑟∗(−𝐀⊤𝑦𝑘+1) and 𝑧𝑘+1 ∈ 𝜕𝑔∗(𝑦𝑘+1)
such that

∇2 ℎ(𝑥(𝑡) + 𝑥′(𝑡) )( 𝑥′′(𝑡) + (1 − 𝛾′(𝑡) )𝑥′(𝑡)) = −𝜆(𝑡)∇𝑓 (𝑥(𝑡)) ⇔ 𝑑 ∇ℎ(𝑥(𝑡) + 𝑥′(𝑡) )

This shows that for 𝜂 ≡ 1, the dynamic coincides with the Lagrangian

This means that the proximal point method can be implemented for the given instance as the implicit method
𝑥𝑘+1 ∈ argmin{𝑟(𝑥) + 𝐀𝑥, 𝑦𝑘+1 },

The Proximal Method of Multipliers and ADMM

In this section we turn our attention to a classical method for solv- ing linearly constrained optimization problems building on the classi- cal idea of the celebrated method of multipliers. An extremely powerful proponent of this class of algorithms is the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), which has received enormous interest from dif- ferent directions, including PDEs (Attouch et al., 2011; 2007), mixed- integer programming (Feizollahi et al., 2017), optimal control (Lin et al., 2012) and signal processing (Yang and Zhang, 2011; Yuan, 2012). The very influential monograph (Boyd et al., 2011) contains over 180 refer- ences, reflecting the deep impact of alternating methods on optimization theory and its applications. Following the general spirit of this survey, we introduce alternating direction methods in a proximal framework,
𝑦𝑘+1 = 𝑦𝑘 + 𝑐(𝐀𝑥𝑘+1 − 𝑧𝑘+1).
erates 𝑥𝑘+1, 𝑧𝑘+1, 𝑦𝑘+1 simultaneously. Of course, this does not give rise This defines a fully implicit iteration, which requires to compute the it-
to a practical algorithm. The main idea behind alternating methods is to organize the computations in a Gauss-Seidel kind of iterations in which the sequences are updated sequentially using the most recent informa-
tion available. To set the stage, observe that (𝑥𝑘+1, 𝑧𝑘+1) defined above
is the coordinate-wise minimum of the function
𝐹 (𝑥, 𝑧, 𝑦𝑘) = 𝑔(𝑧) + 𝑟(𝑥) + 𝑐 𝐀𝑥 − 𝑧 + 1 𝑦𝑘 2.
2	𝑐
In that sense, the proximal point method applied to the dual can be represented more compactly as
(𝑥𝑘+1, 𝑧𝑘+1) ∈ argmin 𝐹 (𝑥, 𝑧, 𝑦𝑘), 𝑦𝑘+1 = 𝑦𝑘 + 𝑐(𝐀𝑥𝑘+1 − 𝑧𝑘+1).
(𝑥,𝑧)
This scheme is known as the augmented Lagrangian method.
Observe that minimizers of the function 𝐹 (𝑥, 𝑧, 𝑦𝑘) with respect to
(𝑥, 𝑧) agree with the minimizers of the function

as pioneered by Rockafellar Rockafellar (1976a,b), and due to Shefi and

elaborations.
To set the stage, consider the composite convex optimization prob- lem (P), in its special form (2.7):
Ψ(𝑥) = 𝑔(𝐀𝑥) + 𝑟(𝑥),
which is known as the augmented Lagrangian of problem (4.1). Using the augmented Lagrangian, an alternating minimization procedure build- ing on the proximal point idea gives rise to the celebrated Alternating Direction of Method of Multipliers (ADMM).

problem formulation above.

The Douglas-Rachford algorithm and ADMM

The Douglas-Rachford (DR) algorithm is a fundamental method to solve general monotone inclusion problems where the task is to find ze- ros of the sum of two maximally monotone operators (see Bauschke and Combettes (2016) and Auslender and Teboulle (2006a)). To keep the fo- cus on convex programming, we introduce this method for solving the
dual problem (4.2). To that end, let us define the matrix 𝐊 = −𝐀⊤, so
that our aim is to solve the convex programming problem
𝑦𝑘+1 = 𝑦𝑘 + 𝑐(𝐀𝑥𝑘+1 − 𝑧𝑘+1)
which is just the standard ADMM. By this we have recovered a classi- cal result on connection between the DR and ADMM algorithms due to Gabay (1983) and Eckstein and Bertsekas (1992).
Proximal Variant of ADMM

the term 𝐀𝑥 in the update of 𝑥𝑘+1. The presence of this factor makes One of the limitations of the ADMM comes from the presence of
it impossible to implement the algorithm in parallel, which makes it slightly unattractive for large-scale problems in distributed optimiza- tion. Moreover, due to the result of Chen et al. (2016) the conver- gence of ADMM for general linear constraints does not generalize to more than two blocks. Leaving parallelization issues aside, Shefi and Teboulle Shefi and Teboulle (2014) proposed an interesting extension of the ADMM by adding further quadratic penalty terms, which allows much flexibility by suitably choosing the norms employed in the algo-
rithm. Given some point (𝑥𝑘, 𝑧𝑘, 𝑦𝑘) ∈ 𝖷 × 𝖹 × ℝ𝑚 and two positive def-
inite matrices 𝐌1, 𝐌2, we define the proximal augmented Lagrangian of
(4.1) as

Any solution 𝑧̄ ∈ dom(𝑟∗) satisfies the monotone inclusion

The DR algorithm aims to determine such a point 𝑧̄ by iteratively con- structing a sequence {(𝑢𝑘, 𝑣𝑘, 𝑦𝑘), 𝑘  0} determined by
𝑣𝑘+1 = (Id +𝑐𝐊⊤◦𝜕𝑟∗◦𝐊)−1 (2𝑦𝑘 − 𝑢𝑘),

AD-PMM allows for various choices of the matrices 𝐌1, 𝐌2.
With 𝐌1 = 𝐌2 = 0, we recover the classical ADMM. For any 𝑐 > 0,
it is known (Gabay, 1983; Glowinski and Tallec, 1989) that conver-
gence in function values as well as global convergence to to dual multiplier are warranted. To ensure convergence of the primal se-
quence (𝑥𝑘)𝑘, one needs to assume that 𝐀 has full column rank.
With the choice 𝐌1 = 𝜇1 𝐈𝑛, 𝐌2 = 𝜇2 𝐈𝑚 with 𝜇1 , 𝜇2 > 0, the AD-PMM
of (Eckstein, 1994) is recovered.

Our derivation of an iteration complexity estimate of AD-PMM proceeds in two steps. First, we present an interesting “Meta-Theorem”, due to Shefi and Teboulle (2014), and stated here as Proposition 4.2. It for-


Dividing both sides by 𝑁 and using the convexity of the Lagrangian with respect to (𝑥, 𝑧) and the linearity in 𝑦, we easily get
𝐿(𝑥̄ , 𝑧̄ , 𝑦) − 𝐿(𝑥, 𝑧, 𝑦̄ ) ≤  1  (𝐶(𝑥, 𝑧) + 1 ‖𝑦 − 𝑦0‖2 )

satisfying a specific per-iteration bound. We then apply this general re-
sult to AD-PMM, by verifying that this scheme actually satisfies these

The practical application of an LO requires to make a selection from the set of solutions of the defining linear minimization problem. The precise definition of such a selection mechanism is not of any impor-
tance, and thus we are just concerned with any answer	(𝑦) revealed

Applying this fundamental identity, we see	by the oracle.

𝑐𝑧𝑘+1 + Prox𝑐𝑔∗ (𝑦𝑘 + 𝑐𝐀𝑥𝑘+1) = 𝑦𝑘 + 𝑐𝐀𝑥𝑘+1.
The second summand is just the 𝑦𝑘+1-update in the CP algorithm, so that
we deduce
𝑐𝑧𝑘+1 + 𝑦𝑘+1 = 𝑦𝑘 + 𝑐𝐀𝑥𝑘+1 ⇔ 𝑦𝑘+1 = 𝑦𝑘 + 𝑐(𝐀𝑥𝑘+1 − 𝑧𝑘+1).
Consequently,
𝑝𝑘+1 = 𝑦𝑘+1 + 𝑐(𝐀𝑥𝑘+1 − 𝑧𝑘+1) = 2𝑦𝑘+1 − 𝑦𝑘,
and hence we recover the three-step iteration defining CP:
The information-theoretic assumption that the optimizer can only query a linear minimization oracle is clearly the main difference be- tween CG and other gradient-based methods discussed in Section 3. For instance, the dual averaging algorithm solves at each iteration a strongly convex subproblem of the form
min{ 𝑦, 𝑢 + ℎ(𝑢)},	(5.3)
where ℎ ∈  (𝖷), whereas CG solves a single linear minimization prob-

Given the above derivations, we can summarize this subsection by the following interesting observation.
Proposition 4.3 (Proposition 3.1, Shefi and Teboulle (2014)). Let
(𝑥𝑘, 𝑦𝑘, 𝑝𝑘) be a sequence generated by CP with 𝜃 = 1. Then, the 𝑦𝑘+1-update
(4.20) is equivalent to
feasible set 𝖷. To illustrate this point, consider the spectrahedron
𝖷 = {𝐗 ∈ ℝ𝑛×𝑛 𝐗 ⪰ 0, tr(𝐗)  1}. Computing the orthogonal projec- tion of some symmetric matrix 𝐘 onto the spectrahedron requires first to compute the full spectral decomposition 𝐘 = 𝐔𝐃𝐔⊤ , and then for the diagonal matrix 𝐃 computing the projection of its diagonal el-
ements onto the simplex. The resulting projection is therefore given

The Conditional Gradient Method

The eﬃciency of the Bregman proximal gradient method stands and falls with the relative ease of evaluating the Bregman proximal operator (3.7). In this section, we present a class of first-order methods which gain relevance in large-scale problems for which the computation of the projection-like operators is a significant computational bottleneck. We describe conditional gradient (CG) methods, a family of methods which, originating in the 1960’s, have received much attention in both machine learning and optimization in the last 20 years. CG is designed to solve convex programming problems over compact convex sets. Therefore, we assume in this section that the feasible set 𝖷 is a compact convex set.
Assumption 9. The set 𝖷 is a compact convex subset in a finite- dimensional real vector space 𝖵.
Classical Conditional gradient

CG, also known as the Frank-Wolfe method, was independently de- veloped by Frank and Wolfe Frank and Wolfe (1956) for linearly con- strained quadratic problems, and by Levitin and Polyak Levitin and Polyak (1966) for general smooth convex optimization problems over compact domains:
This operation can be typically done using numerical linear algebra techniques such as Power, Lanczos or Kaczmarz, and randomized versions thereof (see Kuczyński and Woźniakowski (1992) for gen- eral complexity results). For large-scale problems, computing such a leading eigenvector to a predefined accuracy is much more eﬃcient than a full spectral decomposition.
Simplicity: The definition of an LO does not rely on a specific DGF
ℎ ∈  (𝖷) and makes the update aﬃne invariant.
Structural properties of the updates: When the feasible set 𝖷 can be


represented as the convex hull of a countable set of atoms (”gener- ators”), then CG often leads to simple updates, activating only few atoms at each iteration. In particular, in the case of the spectrahe- dron, the LO returns a matrix of rank one, which allows for sparsity preserving iterates.

CG attempts to solve problem (5.1) by sequentially calling a linear oracle
(LO), a fundamental notion we introduce next.
Exact line search:  𝛾𝑘 ∈ argmin 𝑓 (𝑥𝑘−1 + 𝑡(𝑝𝑘 − 𝑥𝑘−1)),	(5.6)

Exact line search is conceptually attractive, but can be costly in large- scale applications when computing the function value is computation-

ally expensive. To understand the construction of the adaptive step-size scheme, it is instructive to introduce a primal gap (merit) function to the problem defined as
𝚎(𝑥) ∶= sup ∇𝑓 (𝑥), 𝑥 − 𝑢 .	(5.8)
𝑢∈𝖷
This merit function is just the gap program (see e.g. Facchinei and Pang (2003)) associated to the monotone variational inequality (2.6) in which the non-smooth part is trivial. In terms of this merit function, the descent lemma (3.15) yields immediately
gradient assumption, where Ωℎ(𝖷) is the diameter of set 𝖷. On the other
hand, choosing ℎ(𝑥) = 𝑓 (𝑥) and 𝐿ℎ = 𝐿𝑓 , we essentially retrieve the fi-
nite curvature assumption used by Jaggi Jaggi (2013).
Remark 5.1. It is clear that the finite curvature assumption (5.10) is not compatible with the DGF to be essentially smooth on 𝖷. We are therefore forced to work with non-steep distance-generating functions.
The analysis of CG under a relative smoothness condition and Assumption 10 runs in the same way as for the classical CG. However, the adaptive step-size is reformulated as

returns the adaptive step-size rule in (5.7). Once the optimizer decided upon the specific step-size policy, the classical CG picks one of the step sizes (5.5), (5.6), or (5.7), and performs the update
𝑥𝑘 = 𝑥𝑘−1 + 𝛾𝑘 (𝑝(𝑥𝑘) − 𝑥𝑘−1).

sults in a smaller step-size than the adaptive step, which hints towards a deterioration of performance. Nevertheless, this trick allows us to han- dle convex programming problems outside the Lipschitz smooth case, which is not uncommon in various applications (Bian and Chen, 2015; Bian et al., 2015; Haeser et al., 2018).

Generalized Conditional Gradient

Introduced by Bach Bach (2015) and Nesterov (2018a), the general- ized conditional gradient (GCG) method, is targeted to solve our master problem (P) over a compact set 𝖷. To handle the composite case, we need to modify our definition of a linear oracle accordingly.

Choose a step-size 𝛾𝑘 either by (5.5), (5.6), (5.7);
Update 𝑥𝑘 = 𝑥𝑘−1 + 𝛾𝑘 (𝑝𝑘 − 𝑥𝑘−1);

The convergence properties of classical CG under either of the step- size variants above is well documented in the literature (see e.g. the recent text by Lan (2020), or Jaggi (2013)). We will obtain a full con-

Relative smoothness
The basic ingredient in proving convergence and complexity results on the classical CG is the fundamental inequality

and the same three step size policies as in the classical CG, with the standard step size remaining the same and the obvious modifications for the two other step size policies:

𝑡∈[0,1]
{ 𝑟(𝑥𝑘−1) − 𝑟(𝑝𝑘) + ∇𝑓 (𝑥𝑘−1), 𝑥𝑘−1 − 𝑝𝑘	}

Based on the relative smoothness analysis in Section 3.3.3, it seems to be intuitively clear that we could easily prove also convergence of CG when instead of the restrictive Lipschitz gradient assumption we make
Adaptive:	𝛾𝑘 = min

(5.13)

a relative smoothness assumption in terms of the pair (𝑓, ℎ) for some DGF ℎ ∈ 𝛼(𝖷). Indeed, if we are able to estimate a scalar 𝐿ℎ > 0 such
that 𝐿ℎ ℎ(𝑥) − 𝑓 (𝑥) is convex on 𝖷, then the modified Descent Lemma
(3.19) yields the overestimation
𝑓 (𝑥 + 𝑡(𝑝 − 𝑥)) ≤ 𝑓 (𝑥) − 𝑡𝚎(𝑥) + 𝐿ℎ 𝐷 (𝑥 + 𝑡(𝑝 − 𝑥), 𝑥).	(5.9) Instead of requiring that 𝑓 has a Lipschitz continuous gradient over the convex compact set 𝖷, let us alternatively require the following:
The adaptive step size variant is derived from an augmented merit func- tion, taking into consideration the non-smooth composite nature of the underlying optimization problem. Indeed, as again can be learned from the basic theory of variational inequalities (see Nesterov (2007)), the natural merit function for the composite model problem (P) is the non- smooth function
𝚎(𝑥) = sup Γ(𝑥, 𝑢), where Γ(𝑥, 𝑢) ∶= 𝑟(𝑥) − 𝑟(𝑢) + ∇𝑓 (𝑥), 𝑥 − 𝑢 .   (5.14)

such that 𝐿ℎ ℎ − 𝑓 is convex on 𝖷, and ℎ has a finite curvature on 𝖷,
only if 𝑥 ∈ 𝖷 . These basic properties justify our terminology, calling

𝑓
that is,
2𝐷 (𝑡𝑢 + (1 − 𝑡)𝑥, 𝑥)

so that for all 𝑥, 𝑢 ∈ dom(𝑟),
Γ(𝑥, 𝑢) ≥ 𝑟(𝑥) − 𝑟(𝑢) + 𝑓 (𝑥) − 𝑓 (𝑢) = Ψ(𝑥) − Ψ(𝑢).
From here, one immediately arrives at the relation
where the second inequality follows from 𝑠𝐾 < min{𝐿𝑓 Ω2 , 𝑠0}, the third inequality follows from  𝑎	 being a monotonic function in 𝑎 0 for
any 𝑘 ≥ 𝐾 + 1, and the last inequality follows from 𝐾 ≤ max {2,  𝑠0  }.

Alternative assumptions and step-sizes

Such a bound was given to us essentially for free under the compactness

Based on this fundamental inequality of the per-iteration decrease, we
can deduce the iteration complexity via an induction argument. First, one observes that for each of the three introduced step-size rules (stan- dard, line search and adaptive), one obtains a recursion of the form
Ψ(𝑥𝑘−1 + 𝛾 (𝑝𝑘 − 𝑥𝑘−1)) ≤ Ψ(𝑥𝑘−1) − 𝛾 𝚎(𝑥𝑘−1) +   𝑘 𝑝𝑘 − 𝑥𝑘 2.
on the smooth part 𝑓 . The resulting complexity constant is then de- assumption of the domain 𝖷, and the Lipschitz-smoothness assumption termined by 𝐿𝑓 Ω2 . Moreover, this constant will be involved in lower
bounds of the adaptive step-size rule (5.13). However, such a constant may not be known, or may be expensive to compute. Moreover, a global
estimate of this constant is not actually needed for obtaining an upper

be a constant such that the point obtained by using this step-size is upper bounded by the corresponding quadratic function, i.e.,
Ψ((1 − 𝛾(𝑥, 𝑀 ))𝑥 + 𝛾(𝑥, 𝑀 )𝑝(𝑥)) ≤ 𝑄(𝑥, 𝑝(𝑥), 𝛾(𝑥, 𝑀 ), 𝑀 ) < Ψ(𝑥).	(5.16)
Thus applying the update 𝑥+ ∶= (1 − 𝛾(𝑥, 𝑀 ))𝑥 + 𝛾(𝑥, 𝑀 )𝑝(𝑥), we obtain

To conclude, we reiterate that the step-size choices analyzed here are the most common, but there may be many more choices of step- size which provide similar guarantees. For example, Freund and Gri- gas (2016) suggests new step-size rules based on an alternative analysis of the CG method that utilizes an updated duality gap. (Nesterov, 2018a) discusses recursive step-size rules, and in Dvurechensky et al. (2020a); Odor et al. (2016) new step-size rules are suggested based on additional assumptions on the problem structure.

Variants of CG

One of the main drawbacks of CG method is that, in general, it comes with worse complexity bounds than BPGM for strongly convex functions. Indeed, it was shown as early as in 1968 by Canon and Cul-
lum (1968) (see also Lan (2013, 2020)) that the rate of 𝑂( 1 ) is in fact

ary of 𝖷. Thus, when 𝑓 is strongly convex, Jaggi and Lacoste-Julian away-step step-size will not necessarily result on a point on the bound-
Lacoste-Julien and Jaggi (2015) show a linear convergence of AW-CG with a rate that only depends on the geometry of set 𝖷, which is cap- tured by the pyramidal width parameter. The Pairwise variant of AW-CG, which is also presented and analyzed in Lacoste-Julien and Jaggi (2015),

(Nesterov, 2018a) showed an accelerated 𝑂( 𝑘2 ) rate of convergence
for GCG with strongly convex 𝑟 (𝜇 > 0). Linear convergence of the CG
method can only be proved under additional assumptions regarding the
problem structure or location of the optimal solution (see e.g. Beck and Teboulle (2004); Dunn (1979); Epelman and Freund (2000); Guélat and Marcotte (1986); Levitin and Polyak (1966)).
Departing from these somewhat negative results, variants of the clas- sical CG were suggested in order to obtain the desired linear conver-
gence in the case of strongly convex function 𝑓 . We will discuss four of
these variants: Away-step CG, Fully-corrective CG, CG based on a local
linear optimization oracle (LLOO), and CG with sliding.

Away-step CG
The away-step variation of CG (AW-CG), first suggested by
two calls of the LO at each iteration. The first call generates 𝑝𝑘 = Wolfe (1970), treats the case where 𝖷 is a polyhedron. It requires
𝖷(∇𝑓 (𝑥𝑘−1)), defined in the original CG algorithm, while the second
call generates an additional vector 𝑢𝑘 =  (−∇𝑓 (𝑥𝑘−1)). The two vec-
some subset A𝑘 ⊆ A. The heart of the method is a correction routine, which updates the correction atoms A𝑘 and iterate 𝑥𝑘, and satisfy the
following:
𝑆 𝑘 ⊆ A𝑘
𝑓 (𝑥𝑘) ≤ min 𝑓 ((1 − 𝑡)𝑥𝑘−1 + 𝑡𝑝𝑘)
𝑡∈[0,1]
𝜖	max ∇𝑓 (𝑥𝑘), 𝑠 − 𝑥𝑘
𝑠∈𝑆 𝑘
where 𝑝𝑘 = G (∇𝑓 (𝑥𝑘−1)), and 𝜖 is a given accuracy parameter. The FC-
CG was known by various names depending on the updating scheme of
𝑘 and 𝑥𝑘 (Holloway, 1974; Von Hohenbalken, 1977), and was uni-
fied and analyzed to show linear convergence in Lacoste-Julien and
Jaggi (2015). The convergence analysis of FC-CG is similar to that of AW-CG, and is based on the correction routine guaranteeing that the forward step is larger than the away-step computed in the previous it- eration.
In order to apply FC-CG one must choose a correction routine, and

linear convergence for the case where the smooth part 𝑓 is strongly con-
vex, is obtained by a specific update of 𝛿𝑘 at each step of the algorithm. This update depends on the Lipschitz constant 𝐿𝑓 , the strong convex- ity constant of 𝑓 , and the parameter 𝜌. Moreover, despite the fact that

In previous sections we focused on simple first-order methods with sublinear convergence guarantees in the convex case, and linear con- vergence in the strongly convex case. Towards the end of the discussion in Section 3, we pointed out the possibility to accelerate simple itera- tive schemes via suitably defined extrapolation steps. In this last section of the survey, we are focusing on such accelerated methods. The idea of acceleration dates back to 1980’s. The rationale for this research direc- tion is the desire to understand the computational boundaries of solv-

Linear Convergence

Under additional assumptions, we can use the scheme A-BPGM to obtain a linear convergence rate, or, in other words, logarithmic in the
that Ψ(𝑥) satisfies a quadratic error bound condition for some 𝜇 > 0: desired accuracy complexity bound. One such possible assumption is
each restart. This leads to the complexity estimate 𝑂(√ Ω𝐿𝑓 log2	0 which is optimal (Nemirovski and Yudin, 1983; Nesterov, 2018b) for first-order methods applied to smooth strongly convex optimization problems.

the above rate estimate with the one reported in Nemirovski (2004), one observes that the bound in Nemirovski (2004) has a similar to (6.20) structure, yet with the second term being non-accelerated,
i.e. proportional to 1∕𝑁 . This approach was generalized to obtain
an accelerated method for a special class of variational inequali-
ties in Chen et al. (2017), where an optimal iteration complexity
𝑂(𝐿∕  𝜀) to reach an 𝜀-close solution is reported. In the original
paper (Nesterov, 2005b), the smoothing parameter is fixed and re-
quires to know the parameters of the problem in advance. This has been improved in Nesterov (2005a), where an adaptive version of the smoothing techniques is proposed. This framework was extended in Alacaoglu et al. (2017); Tran-Dinh et al. (2020); Tran-Dinh and Cevher (2014); Tran-Dinh et al. (2018) for structured composite opti- mization problems in the form (2.7) and a related primal-dual represen- tation (2.8). A related line of works studies minimization of strongly con- vex functions under linear constraints. Similarly to (6.16) the objective in the Lagrange dual problem has Lipschitz gradient, yet the challenge is that the feasible set in the dual problem is not bounded. Despite that it is possible to obtain accelerated primal-dual methods (Anikin et al., 2017; Chernov et al., 2016; Dvurechensky et al., 2016; 2018b; Guminov et al., 2021; 2019; Ivanova et al., 2020; Kroshnin et al., 2019; Nesterov et al., 2020; Tran-Dinh and Cevher, 2014; Tran-Dinh et al., 2018). In particular, this allows to obtain improved complexity bounds for differ- ent types of optimal transport problems (Dvurechensky et al., 2018a; 2018b; Guminov et al., 2021; Kroshnin et al., 2019; Lin et al., 2020; 2019; 2019; Tupitsa et al., 2020; Uribe et al., 2018).

Closing Remarks Let us make several remarks on the related literature. A close approach is proposed in Nemirovski (2004), where the problem (6.15) is considered directly as a min-max saddle-point problem. These classes of equilibrium problems are typically solved via tools from mono- tone variational inequalities, whose performance is typically worse than the performance of optimization algorithms. In particular, contrasting

and all 𝑓 (𝑥) ∈ 𝜕𝑓 (𝑥) and 𝑓 (𝑦) ∈ 𝜕𝑓 (𝑦). If 𝜈 = 1, we recover the 𝐿𝑓 - smoothness condition (2.1). If 𝜈 = 0 we have that 𝑓 has bounded varia-
tion of the subgradient, which is essentially equivalent to the bounded subgradient Assumption 8. The main observation (Devolder et al., 2014; Nesterov, 2015) is that this Hölder condition allows to prove an inex- act version of the ”descent Lemma” inequality (3.15). More precisely
Nesterov (2015, Lemma 2), for any 𝑥, 𝑦 ∈ dom 𝑓 and any 𝛿 > 0,
𝑓 (𝑦) ≤ 𝑓 (𝑥) + 𝑓 ′(𝑥), 𝑦 − 𝑥 +  𝐿𝜈  𝑦 − 𝑥 1+𝜈 ≤ 𝑓 (𝑥) + 𝑓 ′(𝑥), 𝑦 − 𝑥 + 𝐿 𝑦 − 𝑥 2 + 𝛿,

the same steps as the derivation of the convergence rate for A-BPGM in Section 6.1. The first thing which is changed is equation (6.1), where now the inexact descent Lemma is used instead of the exact one. The
only difference is that 𝐿𝑓 is changed to its local approximation 𝐿𝑘+1 and
add the error term 𝜀𝛼𝑘+1 appears in the r.h.s. In (6.2) the new quadratic

equation with 𝐿𝑘+1 is used and the inequality remains the same. This

It is easy to see that the oracle complexity, i.e. the number of proximal

Conclusion





A-BPGM is in one simple change of the step for 𝑢𝑘+1, to obtain the con- Since the difference between such conditional gradient method and
vergence rate of the former, it is suﬃcient to track, what changes such approximate Bregman Proximal step entails in the convergence rate proof for A-BPGM. In other words, we need to understand what hap- pens with the proof for A-BPGM if the Bregman Proximal step is made inexactly by applying the generalized linear oracle. The first important difference is that we need an inexact version of inequality (3.12), which was used in the convergence proof of A-BPGM and which the result of the exact Bregman Proximal step. To obtain its inexact version, let us denote
𝜑(𝑥) = 𝛼𝑘+1 𝑓 (𝑦𝑘+1) + ∇𝑓 (𝑦𝑘+1), 𝑥 − 𝑦𝑘+1 + 𝑟(𝑥) .
set 𝖷 to obtain 𝑢𝑘+1. Thus, by the optimality condition, we have that Then generalized linear oracle actually minimizes this function on the there exists 𝜉 ∈ 𝜕𝜑(𝑢𝑘+1) such that 𝜉, 𝑢𝑘+1 − 𝑥  0 for all 𝑥 ∈ 𝖷. Now
we remind that the Bregman Proximal step in A-BPGM minimizes
𝜑(𝑥) + 𝐷ℎ (𝑥, 𝑢𝑘). These observations allow to estimate the inexactness
of the Bregman Proximal step implemented via generalized linear ora-
We close this survey, with a very important fact which Nesterov writes in the introduction of his important textbook (Nesterov, 2018b): in general, optimization problems are unsolvable. Convex programming stands out from this general fact, since it describes a significantly large class of model problems, with important practical applications, for which general solution techniques have been developed within the mathematical framework of interior-point techniques. However, mod- ern optimization problems are large-scale in nature, which renders these polynomial time methods impractical. First-order methods have become the gold standard in balancing cheap iterations with low solution accu- racy, and many theoretical and practical advances having been made in the last 20 years.
Despite the fact that convex optimization is approaching the state
of being a primitive similar to linear algebra techniques, we foresee that the development of first-order methods has not come to a halt yet. In connection with stochastic inputs, the combination of acceler- ation techniques with other performance boosting tricks, like variance reduction, incremental techniques, as well as distributed optimization, still promises to produce some new innovations. On the other hand,

the desired inexact version of (3.12).
Let us now see, how this affects the convergence rate proof of A- BPGM. Inequality (3.12) was used in the analysis only in (6.5). This

Another important focus in the research in optimization methods is now on numerical methods for non- convex optimization motivated by training of deep neural networks, see Danilova et al. (2020); Sun (2019) for a recent review. A number of open questions remain in the theory of first-order methods for variational in- equalities and saddle-point problems, mainly in the case of variational inequalities with non-monotone operators. In particular, recently the



authors of (Cohen et al., 2021) observed a connection between extra- gradient methods for monotone variational inequalities and accelerated first-order methods. Thus, as we emphasize in this survey, new con- nections, that are still continuously being discovered between different methods and different formulations, can lead to new understanding and developments in this lively field of first-order methods.
