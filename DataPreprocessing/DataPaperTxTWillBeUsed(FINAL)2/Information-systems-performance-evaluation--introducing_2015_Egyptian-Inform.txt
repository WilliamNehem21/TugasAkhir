Introduction

With the emergence of Information and Communication tech- nologies, and the relatively cheap cost of calls (voice and data), the use of call centers to provide new services to citizens has grown extensively [1]. Evolution in call centers technologies, systems and infrastructures allowed the transformation of industries and services in big enterprises and organizations, customer support services, marketing services and after sales support are examples of such transformations. Moreover, the use of call centers in real time critical services is growing.
In Egypt, call centers have been used to improve the service of emergency control systems. Call centers have been used for call taking, dispatching and tracking of emergency calls [2]. The system monitors the overall performance and response time to guarantee the quality of service provided to the citi- zens. The system has successfully proved the improvement in the services provided by the ambulance system during the cir- cumstances that Egypt has faced since the 25th of January rev- olution. An example of using specialized call centers in other countries is India, where first line health consultations have been provided by a specialized call center in order to reduce the referral of cases to primary care health units [3]. Outsourc- ing critical services to specialized call centers will definitely help in improving the quality of services provided by the gov- ernment, companies and organizations to the targeted customers.
This new shift in services provisioning necessitates a thor- ough analysis of the design, implementation and performance evaluation of call centers. This analysis should not only include the call center system design, infrastructure, connectivity, reli- ability, and information systems used, but also organizational, management structures, and agents’ skills should be consid- ered. Different techniques have been used in the literature for the evaluation of the performance call centers. Due to the complexity of the system, simulation based techniques are the most commonly used [4], these techniques do not take
into consideration recent trends such as skill-based routing, electronic channels and interactive call handling. On the other hand, analytical techniques and operation research and queu- ing theory techniques are also adapted to model and analyze call centers.
Queuing theory approach is usually associated with assumptions in order to ease the modeling and the analytical complexity. These techniques do not reflect the reality due to the complexity of the system and the assumptions and the sim- plifications in the models proposed. The models are used to calculate the blocking rate, the average waiting time for the calls, the number of customer retrials [5]. A survey of the recent literature on call center operation management is pro- vided [6]. Special focus has been given to new management challenges that have been caused by emerging technologies, to behavioral issues associated with both call center agents and customers, and to the interface between call center opera- tions and sales and marketing.
Many researchers and call centers industry associations and institutions have proposed a number of performance indica- tors [7,8] to be used to measure call centers operation. Some of these performance indicators are targeting measurement of the call center overall performance, others target the quality of service provided to the customers, while other indicators target the quality and skills of the individual employee accord- ing to North American Quitline Consortium (NAQC) [7] as presented by Tables 1–3.
The objective of this paper was to introduce a new tech- nique that can support decision makers in the call centers industry to evaluate, and analyze the performance of call cen- ters. The technique presented in this work is derived from the research done on measuring the success or failure of informa- tion systems. Two models are mainly adopted to measure the performance of success and failures of information systems namely: the Delone and Mclean model first introduced in 1992 [9] and the Design Reality Gap model introduced by Heeks in 2002, [10]. Applying the models to include Internet











based information systems has been experimented by Delone and Mclean for eCommerce systems [11]. The use of the Design Reality Gap model to evaluate the performance of ERP systems, and eGovernment systems has been studied by Heeks [12,13].
This research has adopted the Delone and Mclean model to analyze the performance of the call centers [14]. A call center performance index reflecting the success index of the call center was proposed to measure the overall performance of the call center. A total of 43 indicators were proposed and mapped to the six dimensions of the Delone and Mclean model. The results obtained demonstrate that using multi-dimensional modeling for call centers gives the possibility of analyzing indi- vidual dimensions and identifying the impact of each dimen- sion on the overall performance [14]. Moreover, weighted dimensions indicators would reflect the priorities given by the top management for the calculation of the performance index.
As a contribution of this work, this article highlights the possibility of applying the Design Reality Gap model, in this respect it is proposed a Gap Index in addition to the perfor- mance index already proposed in [14]. An overall performance Gap Index is introduced in this article using the seven
dimensions of the design-reality gap model. Additionally, a Call Center Performance Evaluation (CCPE) tool is developed to be applied in the two models to calculate the performance success index and the Gap Index.
The reason behind developing the Gap Index is to measure the existing gap between the benchmarked values for the indi- cators and the resulting values of the indicators during the operation of the call centers.
This paper applies the Design Reality Gap model to ana- lyze the performance of call centers by mapping the call centers indicators introduced for the Delone and Mclean model in [14] to the seven dimensions of the Design Reality Gap model. It also compares both the Delone and Mclean model in [14] and the Design Reality Gap model presented in this paper.
The rest of the paper is described as follows: Section 2 describes the design-reality gap model as applied to call cen- ters, together with the mapping of the call centers indicators to the design-reality gap model dimensions. Section 3 presents the Call Center Gap Index. Section 4 presents the results of the proposed methodology, and the effect of proposed indicators on the performance assessment of the call centers under study. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper and provides insights for future work.

The Design Reality Gap model for call centers

The foundation of the ‘‘design-reality gap’’ model is expressed in simple terms as the degree of fit between, on the one hand, the requirements and assumptions built into the information system design and, on the other, the real situation found in the organizational context of implementation. Based on the analysis of the Information Systems literature, Heeks indicated that seven dimensions – summarized by the ITPOSMO acro- nym – are necessary and sufficient to provide a comprehensive understanding of design-reality gaps [10]:

Information Technology Processes
Objectives and Values
Staffing and Skills

Management Systems and structures
Other Resources

















Gap

Information Technology Processes
Objectives and Values
Staffing and Skills

Management Systems and structures
Other Resources





Information: includes both formal and informal informa- tion, held on both IT based and other types of information
system.
Technology: mainly focuses on information handling tech- nology (particularly IT but also paper, telephones, etc.),
but can cover other types of technology such as production machinery.
Processes: the activities undertaken by the relevant part of the organization – both information related processes and
broader business processes.
Objectives and values: often the most important dimension since the ‘objectives’ component covers issues of self-inter-
est and organizational politics, and can even be seen to incorporate formal organizational strategies; the ‘values’ component covers organizational culture: what stakehold- ers feel are the right and wrong ways to do things.
Staffing and skills: cover both the number of staff and their competencies (particularly skills, but also knowledge).
Management systems and structures: the overall manage- ment systems required to organize plus the way in which
the organization  is structured, both formally and informally.
Other resources: time and money.
Putting these dimensions together with the notion of gaps produces the model (Fig. 1) for understanding success and fail- ure of information systems.
Following the same conceptualization method, this paper is applying the Design Reality Gap model as a framework to measure the Gap Index of call centers. The seven dimensions of the Heeks IS Design Reality Gap model can be applied to the call centers environment as follows:

Information, customers in call centers should be properly authenticated; agents should address the customers with personalized, complete, relevant, easy to understand, and secure content especially in case of customers that perform financial transactions.
Technology, measures the essential characteristics of call center systems including availability, reliability, intelligent routing, channels of communications, as well as the response time represented by calls abandoned, waiting time to answer, and average call-handling time (time actually on phone with customer).
Processes, this dimension reflects the quality of services provided by the agents to the customers. Examples of services may include information retrieval, marketing, technical support, remote diagnosis, remote data entry as in medical transcriptions, mobile, etc.
Figure 1	Design-reality gaps dimensions.



Objectives and values, measure the objectives set by the call center, these objectives may include maximizing the number of customers using the call center, the growth rate of cus- tomers using the system, as well as the rate of re-utilization of the same customer for the call center. Other targets may reflect the net profit and the return on investment for the call center.
Staffing and skills, the number of agents and staff in the call center. A critical parameter to be measured for the agents’ skills is the rate of the escalation of calls beyond the agent representative as the existing system failed to answer the customer query. Measuring customers’ feedback of the call center system should cover the entire customer experience cycle based on the services provided from the call center.
Management systems and structures, this dimension reflects the internal organization structure for the call center, the scheduling design and the degree of overstaffing and understaffing that exists as a result of the scheduling design. Also, it reflects the efficiency of utilization of avail- able resources and the productivity of agents in the call center.
Other resources, cost of service to customer, profit of call center.

Tables 4–10 propose the indicators defined for each dimen- sion of the Design Reality Gap model. Tables 11–16 propose the indicators defined for each dimension of the Delone and Mclean model. Table 17 depicts the proposed mapping between the different call centers indicators, the Delone and Mclean model dimensions, and the Design-Reality gap model dimensions. As it is seen from the tables, different grouping for the indicators is made based on the definition of the dimen- sions for each model.


	









































Call Center Gap Index

In order to analyze the performance of call center and to diag- nose the challenges and the reasons of success or failure of a specific dimension or indicator in call centers, two indices are proposed in this work namely: the Linear Call Center Perfor- mance Index (L-CCPI) and the Call Center Gap Index (CCGI). The success index has been introduced in [14] with the objective of evaluating the overall performance of the call


	

center based on the success index for each of the dimensions of
the Delone and Mclean evaluating model.
The L-CCPI in its simplest form can be calculated as the sum- mation of the D&M dimensions’ performance index as follows:

L-CCPI (Linear Call Center Performance Index).
Figure 2	CCPET main modules.


m	n
L-CCPI = 1/m	(aji)/(n)	(1)
j=1  i=1





where n is the number of indicators for dimension j, m repre- sents the six dimensions of the D&M model, aji represents the value for the indicators for the dimension (Dj).
In this paper, CCGI is proposed to measure the discrepancy of each dimension in reality from the design value. It should also be noted that in case of availability of benchmark values for the different indicators as in the case of call centers [15], the Design Reality Gap model will be substituted by the Benchmark Reality Gap model, where the benchmark values will be used for the gap calculations.
The Call Center Gap Index CCGI in its simplest form can be calculated as the summation of the Design Reality Gap model dimensions’ index as follows:

CCGI (Call Center Gap Index).
m
CCGI =   GI(Dj)/(m)	(2)
j=1
where m represents the seven dimensions of the Design Reality Gap model and GI(Dj) is the Gap Index value for each dimension.
The Gap Index value for each dimension of the model GI(Dj) is calculated based on the values of the indicators defined for each dimension as follows:
n
GI(Dj) =   (gji )/(n)	(3)
i=1

where n is the number of indicators for dimension j, gji repre- sents the value for the Gap indicators for the indicator I in dimension Dj, gji is calculated as the difference between the design value for the indicator and the real or measured value.
gji = (Design value — Real value) for indicator i
In the case of Benchmark Reality Gap model, the gji is cal- culated as the difference between the benchmark value for the indicator and the real or measured value.
gji = (Design or Benchmark value
— Real value) for indicator i
Based on Eq. (2) and (3) the Call Center Gap Index is cal- culated as follows:
CCGI (Call Center Gap Index)
proposed indicators were collected based on the type of indica- tor whether hard or soft indicator. Data for hard indicators (example: blockage rate) are collected using call centers man- agement systems, these systems generate reports that actually include a lot of data, the main challenge resides in the analysis of these reports and to make it easy for decision makers to identify whether a problem exists, and then to identify the source of the problem. The four call centers vary in their nature and location representing two different food sector, marketing, and IT support and a capital city and small city call location.
On the other hand, in order to collect the data for soft indi- cators (example: knowledge and competency, user satisfac- tion), call centers use a variety of methods that may include the following:

Test calling where calls are made to the call center by staff pretending to be customers.
Silent monitoring of calls where a manager or supervisor lis- tens in on certain calls.
Call recording where recording the entire call is made.
Making follow-up outbound call where calls are made after the initial interaction and the customer is questioned about
their experience of the original interaction.

These methods are resource intensive, especially for test calling, silent monitoring and follow-up outbound calls where someone should actually do the monitoring of the outbound call. Moreover, the results of these methods are subjective and dependent on the interpretation of the person in charge of the monitoring and measurement process. With the evolu- tion of call centers and Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems, automated feedback and surveys are done automati- cally by the system upon approval of the customer. Survey scripts (i.e. the questions asked to customers) can be created online over the Internet or through the IVR system. This means that customer satisfaction can be measured almost immediately. The results of these surveys are used for the soft indicators.
For this research, hard indicators data were collected for the four call centers monthly for one year. Four sets of surveys have been conducted for 100 users for each call center using IVR, and phone calls.
Due to the complexity of the system and the large number of indicators included in the study, an evaluation tool was designed, namely the Call Center Performance Evaluation

Tool (CCPET) that can be used by the call centers to make self-assessment. Results for the Delone and Mclean model are presented. Using Heeks’ Design Reality Gap model, results for Gap Index are presented with a comparison between the

Data analysis and results

In recent years, Egypt has become one of the most prominent outsourcing countries, offering a large variety of products meeting the internal and external needs of customers. Existing call centers in Egypt vary in size, the number of clients served, the priority of services provided (real time service vs. nonreal time service, example emergency call centers) and the location of the call center (capital city, big cities, small cities). Four call centers in Egypt were studied during the work, data for the
two models under study with the two performance indices
used: the performance index and the Gap Index.

Call Center Performance Evaluation Tool (CCPET)

Based on the two performance indices proposed in Section 3, a Call Center Performance Evaluation Tool is designed to be used by the call center industry. The tool can be used to analyze the performance of any information system. In its general form, it can also be considered as a generic tool for

performance evaluation. The tool is composed of five main modules: the model definition module, the performance indices module, the Input Data module, the calculation module, and the reporting module. Fig. 2 shows the different modules of CCPET as applied to the call centers.
The model definition module allows the definition of the evaluation models to be adopted in the evaluation, i.e. several models can be used through the assessment. The user needs to define the name of the model and the number and names of dimensions for this model. For example 6 dimensions in the case of the Delone and Mclean model, seven dimensions for the Heeks’ Design Reality Gap model, three dimensions for the NAQC [7], and in the case of a single dimension model (SDM) the number of dimensions is one without any categori- zation. This module also defines the indicators for each dimen- sion and the relative weight of the dimension.
Two performance indices are defined for the performance indices module: the success index and the Gap Index. The user

CCPET allows to define the indicators used, entering the values, and the calculation of the average value per
indicator.
The tool also allows the calculation of the two indexes suc- cess and Gap Index.
Table 18 depicts the resulting data for the four call centers under study for the Delone and Mclean model. The two
indices proposed are calculated, for example for dimension D1, GI for D1 is 18.67%, the overall Gap Index for call center 1 is 84.89%, while the success index for the same call center is 15.11%. it is clear from the data collected to this call center that the performance of the call center for all the dimensions of Heeks is poor, this means that the design of this call center from a technology and skills needed to operate the call center needs a serious revision.
Table 19 depicts the results of calculations of the case of applying Heeks’ Design Reality Gap model. It is to be
noted that the resulting overall Gap Index and success index are equal to those resulting from the Delone and Mclean model; this is due to using the same parameters in the two models. Moreover, the calculation of the Gap Index
quality dimension. For the net benefits dimension, the call cen- ter 3 has the lowest value of gap as shown in Fig. 8. Similarly, Figs. 9–14 show the distribution of the Gap Index for the Delone and Mclean model. Results using the Gap Index con- firm the results of the success index; call center 4 has the lowest system quality dimension Gap Index.

4.4. Call center evaluation using Heeks’ Design Reality Gap model

In this section, the performance evaluation for the four call centers using Heeks’ Design Reality Gap model is imple- mented. CCGI in its simplest form was calculated as the sum- mation of the Design Reality Gap model dimensions’ index (Review Section 3 of ‘‘Call Center Gap Index’’ and Eq. (2)).
Figs. 15–21 depict the Gap Index distribution for the different indicators for each of the seven dimensions of the Heeks’ Design Reality Gap model. For example, Fig. 15 shows the distribution of the information gap dimension function of the indicators defined for this dimension. For the

is not based on benchmarking values. This interprets the value of the gap dimension to be equal to (100 – Success Dimension). It is clear that the main strength for the Design Reality Gap model is to use Benchmarking values to reflect the real gap.


Call center evaluation using Delone and Mclean model

In this section, the success index as well as the Gap Index for the Delone and Mclean model is calculated. Applying the Design Reality Gap model in the Delone and Mclean model means that the same approach proposed by Heeks was applied to the dimensions proposed by the Delone and Mclean model. Figs. 3–8 depict the Gap Index distribution for the different indicators defined for the six dimensions of the Delone and Mclean model. Call center 4 as shown in Fig. 3 is the top center in the system quality dimension index. Call centers 2 and 3 as shown in Fig. 4 have the best performance for the Information

Application of success index and Gap Index for the two models is valid.
The two models are providing the same results in case the reality value used for Heeks’ Design Reality Gap model is
equal to 100.
In order to get the maximum benefit of the Heeks’ Design Reality Gap model, the real benchmark value for the
indicators should be used otherwise the two models are very much similar.
The use of an overall index for the call center whether suc- cess index or Gap Index is providing the top management

sub-dimension indicators are proposed for each of the seven dimensions. Six indicators are defined for the information gap dimension. The overall Gap Index for dimension informa- tion gap for call center 1 is 78%. The higher the value of the
Delone and Mclean model or Heeks’ Design Reality Gap
model allows the identification of the area or dimension that faces challenges. The grouping model should be aligned with the priorities the call center provider is setting.
Proposing success index and Gap Index at the level of the dimension allows analyzing the issues related to a certain
dimension, i.e. diagnosing the points of weakness and strength for the dimension.

The call centers’ scorecard can be composed of 14 values in the case of Delone and Mclean model and 16 values in the
case of Heeks’ Design Reality as follows:
The success index.
The Gap Index (measured by the benchmark values).
The dimensions indices/gap values (6 figures in the case of Delone and Mclean model and 7 figures in the case of Heeks’ Design Reality model).

The scorecard is a simple way to monitor such complex sys- tems such as call centers. A maximum of 16 values are mon-
itored periodically by the top management.


Conclusion and future research

This paper studies the performance evaluation techniques for information systems with the call centers as a case study.
Two models have been used, the Delone & Mclean model and the Design Reality Gap model.
The two levels evaluation technique used is summarized as follows: the first level is simply not to use any modeling tech- nique, so using the indicators for the call centers as if they are mapped to one single dimension, and you get the system to cal- culate your success index and the Gap Index. If the results are satisfactory then actually you do not need to get into more detailed analysis. If results are not satisfactory then you need to select one of the two models the Delone and Mclean model or Heeks’ Design Reality Gap model in order to analyze the overall result obtained from the first step. This will allow iden- tifying which dimension is impacting call center performance. So, first level means to use the tool without any model to get the overall call center performance.
The work presented in this paper is a continuation to our previous report [14], which has shown the applicability of Delone and Mclean model to call centers, and introduced the



success index to measure the performance of each dimension and the overall index.
The overall approach for the two papers is the same, sum- marized in the following three main steps:
The modeling using Heeks’ Design Reality Gap model.
The modeling using Delone and Mclean model.
Measuring using the success index and Gap Index, and the analysis using the CCPET.

In this paper and our previous report [14] the models introduced by Delone and Mclean model and Heeks’ Design Reality Gap model were applied without modification; hence the figures are the same as these figures represent the two models.
The Design Reality Gap model introduced by Heeks was used in this paper to evaluate the performance of call centers. A new metric is used for measuring the performance ‘‘Gap Index’’.
A comparison is made between the Delone and Mclean model and Heeks model. A tool is developed to facilitate the evaluation process and to be used to analyze different model- ing techniques.
The main benefit of the Design Reality Gap model is to measure the gap, the gap between the design value and the real value during the operation and implementation of the informa- tion system. The gap is measured for every dimension; the overall Gap Index gives an overall metric for the call center. Use of Benchmark values for the Heeks’ Design Reality Gap model gives the call centers mangers a method to benchmark their centers.
The work demonstrates that using Heeks’ Design Reality Gap model and/or Delone model can be a feasible technique to model call centers. Gap Index is a better metric to measure the performance especially when Industry Benchmark values are used.
As a conclusion of this research, it was found that the two models reflect the same results when no benchmark values are used for the Heeks’ Design Reality model, especially that the same indicators are used. Hence, it is really crucial in the case of applying Heeks’ Design Reality model to calculate the Gap Index based on the Industry Benchmark values for the differ- ent indicators. Two indices are defined to calculate the perfor- mance of the call center namely the success index and the Gap Index. Indicators grouping per dimension and calculation of an index on the level of dimension make it clear for the deci- sion maker to see the scorecard for the call center. The score- card will be composed of the success index, the Gap Index, and the success index per dimension (6 or 7 numbers based on the model used Delone and Mclean or Heeks’ Design Reality model) and the Gap Index per dimension (6 or 7 numbers based on the model used). This scorecard should be generated monthly so that top managers monitor continuously the per- formance of their call centers. An evaluation tool has been developed to allow call centers managers to evaluate the per- formance of their call centers in a systematic analytical approach. Results showed the importance of using informa- tion systems models to evaluate complex systems as call cen- ters. The models used allow identifying the dimensions for the call centers that are facing challenges, together with an identification of the individual indicators in these dimensions that are causing the poor performance of the call center.
As future work, a study for specific indicators related to specific verticals may enhance the analysis of the call centers specialized in specific field, for example includes financial sec- tors, or health sectors. This may result in adding a specific dimension that is a vertical specific to include indicators related to the vertical. Moreover, analyzing the association of different weights for the model is based on numerical anal- ysis, more research should be done in this area in order to iden- tify the proper weights for each dimension, and whether there is any correlation between these weights and the type of the product or service provided by the call center. Also, there is a need to develop an automated assessment tool that can be used by decision makers to evaluate and benchmark the call centers. One important characteristic of this tool is that it could be integrated to the existing call center monitoring sys- tems, allowing seamless communication and exchange of data between the tool developed (similar to CCPET) and the mon- itoring system in place.
