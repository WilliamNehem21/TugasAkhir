To limit the adverse effect of the fluid pressure field in high-speed gearing systems, especially for the main reducer of helicopters, shrouds usually adopted to enclose and approaches the high-speed gears will play a vital role in the windage and pumping power losses in axial and radial directions. To better explore and predict the total load-independent losses, this paper proposes an improved quasi-analytical method to quantify the power losses caused by the windage and pumping effects, considering the gear pump characteristics with the compressibility of the air or air-oil mixture. The theoretical calculations using the improved model are then compared with experimental results in the open literature. Leveraging the swept volume of the gear pump, the squeezing/pocketing behavior of the fluids in the tooth space can get a better understanding as the shroud approaches the gear pair.





Introduction

Gear system is one of the key components of aero engines and heli- copter transmissions, where the rotating speed of the input stage is up to 20,000 r/min, accompanied by greater power losses. A huger energy dissipation implies a stricter and more rigorous requirement of onboard lubrication and cooling system and endurance mileage. Regarding the high-speed gear transmission, load-independent power losses domi- nating the total losses can easily reach 2–3 % of the transmission power
[1–2]. In general, gear load-independent losses mainly include windage
losses, churning losses, and pumping losses, windage power losses have contributed most to the total losses above 90–120 m/s tip tangential speeds [3]. Once the pitch velocity exceeds 127 m/s, the pumping power
losses are also seen to be a significant part [4]. Due to the gear windage and churning losses approximately proportional to the third power of the rotating speed, the sum of these two losses is more than 50 % of the total energy dissipation of the gear system as the speed exceeding 100 m/s [5]. Thereby, shrouds are commonly adopted to limit these inde- pendent losses and improve the efficacy. Indeed, it is just what this paper tries to deal with the prediction of the power losses when the shroud approaches the gear pair.
Past research has been carried out to model the windage power losses of different kinds of gears. Diab et al. [6] proposed two quasi-analytical theoretical models to estimate the windage drag losses of an isolated
single spur gear, detailly characterizing the drag moment of the fluid flow on the gear faces and inside the teeth. The theoretical method in Seetharaman and Kahraman [7–8] is similar, which is based on
boundary layer theory to predict the windage losses as the sum of the
loss on the faces and teeth space, this method is also applied to the case of splash lubrication [9]. Based on these, Zhu et al. [10–11] developed the theoretical and calculating models of windage losses for a single
spiral bevel gear, presented as the sets of the toe/heel and the teeth. In general, different types of load-independent losses can be added up to quantify the total losses. Ruzek et al. [12–13] explored and determined
the total losses of the no-meshing spur gear pair are approximately equal
to the sum of the individual gear, the same conclusion is reached by Dai et al. [14]. Considering the windage effect, the total independent power losses of a splash-lubricated spiral bevel gear are effectively estimated [15–17], so is a splash and oil jet-lubricated orthogonal face gear
[18–19].
Meanwhile, some researchers tried to model and estimate the gear pumping power losses. Pumping losses, namely the squeezing/pocketing power losses, are attached to the physical phenomenon of trapping and releasing the air or air-oil mixture in the given tooth interspace when the
gears proceed through mesh [20–23]. Using the equation of continuity and energy, Daib et al. [24] used Euler’s prediction and Newton- Raphson correction method to calculate the pressure distributions in a
mesh cycle, verified by experimental data measured by the pressure

sensors implanted under the gear surfaces, then determined the mean value of the pumping losses. Further leveraging the equation of mo- mentum, Seetharaman and Kahraman [8,25] obtained the velocity dis- tributions in a mesh cycle for the estimation of the resulting pumping losses, the results indicated that the pitch line velocity is the most powerful force driving these velocities and power losses, in addition, the velocities and pressures at the end is slightly lower than that at the backlash. A shroud has been recognized as an effective tool to mitigate windage power losses. Gorla et al. [26] replaced the air or air-oil mixture with oil to investigate the influence of geometrical and working pa- rameters on the total power losses subjected to windage and pumping effects for a meshed gear pair in power transmissions. However, its advantageous effect may be offset for a shrouded meshed gear pair due to the squeezing/pocketing behavior in the vicinity of mesh, the related research reported by Delgado and Hurrell [27]. Meanwhile, Hurrell and Sawicki [4,28] also explored the squeezing/pocketing phenomenon of the meshed gears with a shroud by introducing the swept volume of the gear pump.
Benefiting from CFD techniques [29–31], the load-independent los-
ses have been widely and systematically concerned, including windage [32–34], churning [35–38] and impacting phenomena [18,39–40]. Although there still exist some defects in modeling the gear meshing due
to the compression and expansion of the very small cavity and contact of the gear pair in all time, Al et al. [41] conducted a 2D CFD study to explore the pressure change on the gear teeth during the mesh cycle by using several meshed teeth instead of a meshed gear pair, the numerical results agree well with experiments by Diab et al. [24]. Regarding the fluid flow to be isothermal and incompressible, Burberi et al. [23] exploited a dynamic mesh dealing with the meshed gear not in contact to investigate the meshed spinning gear pair partly submerged in an oil
bath. Hurrell and Sawicki [4] adopted ASNSY CFX to simulate the engagement of the shrouded gears, and obtained the swept volume and mesh pressure of the gears in different configurations.
Making a better sense of load-independent losses of the shrouded gears is relatively scarce, especially for the shroud closely approaches the gears. Therefore, this paper presents a quasi-analytical method to deal with the prediction of the load-independent losses of the tightly shrouded meshed gears, considering the windage and pumping effects. Then, based on the volumetric change in the processes of compression and expansion of the given cavity and subsonic compressible flow characteristic, this theoretical calculation model is improved and then compared with experimental findings.

Description of the compression-expansion behavior

For a tooth of the pinion and the conjugate tooth of the gear, the evolution process of the compression-expansion behavior for the space tooth is depicted in Fig. 1. Points K1 and K2 represent the entry and exit points of the top of the pinion entering and exiting the tooth space of the gear. The volume of the tooth space experience from the single-teeth meshing (from point S1 to point D1), double-teeth meshing (from point D1 to point D2) to single-teeth meshing (from point D2 to point S2) processes, when the contact points changing from point S1 (i.e., the top of the gear approaches the root of the pinion tooth) to S2 (i.e., the top of the pinion reaches the gear dedendum), along with the volume first decreasing and then increasing, it means that the air or the air-oil mixture expelled from or sucked into the tooth space. Due to the gear engagement, the air or the air-oil mixture is blocked in the tooth space,

causing variations in fluid density, pressure and temperature. This behavior mainly depends on the attributes of the air or the air-oil mixture (density, viscosity, etc.), gear geometry and operating param- eters, the sonic or non-sonic conditions of the flow, the ambient pressure and temperature.
The involute tooth profile function of the pinion is presented based on the cartesian coordinate system as illustrated in Fig. 1, with the origin at the center of the pinion, expressed as:
Calculation of the gear load-independent losses

According to the study of Ruzek et. al [12] and Dai et. al [14], the windage power losses of the no-meshing gear pair are the sum of the single individual gear. When a shroud approaches the spur gear pair (see Fig. 2), the resulting load-independent power losses can be regarded as the sum of the windage losses on the faces of the individual spur gears and the pumping losses at the gear backlash, expressed as:





[ x0 ] = ( cos(π/z1)	+sin(π/z1) )[ rb1[cos(θos1 + θks1) + θks1sin(θos1 + θks1) ]
], k = (β , γ )	(1)






and
θks = tanαiαi ∈ [0, arccos(rb/ra) ]
θos = π/2z — invαp
The involute tooth profile function of the gear is then expressed as:
Pall = Pwind—1 + Pwind—2 + Ppump	(5)
where Pall is the total resulting load-independent losses. Pwind and Ppump
represent the power losses caused by the windage and squeezing/ pocketing behavior, respectively. Subscript 1,2 denotes the driving and driven gears.

Pumping losses
As a shroud approaches the spur gear pair, the whole of the gears and the shroud can be regarded as a gear pump. The behavior of pumping fluid through the clearance gap on the top of the tight shroud is similar to the operation principle of a gear. Following the definition of swept volume as described in Ref.[4,42], the squeezing/pocketing losses of the meshed spur gears are expressed as:

the width wo and distance la:

Additionally, as for the mixture of air and oil, the fluid density and
viscosity are defined as:
ρ = αamρair + (1 — αam )ρoil	(20)
and
μ = αamμair + (1 — αam )μoil	(21)
with αam being the volume ratio of air to the total mixture.

Test description

The load-independent power loss tests by Hurrell et al [4] were performed on the gear windage test facility of NASA Glenn Research Center, the experimental power losses of the tight shrouded gears were used to compare with the predictions in this paper. The experimental scheme is described in details as follows. The meshed spur gear tests were respectively run in unshrouded and shrouded configurations at the
same oil supply conditions. Each test typically involves three steps:

tightly shrouded meshed gears in the G1 configuration mainly comes from the teeth spaces, while some swept volume of the shrouded gears in G2 is from the radial clearance of 17 mm. Therefore, these reasons need to be one-by-one analyzed.
Based on the idea of Seetharaman and Kahraman [6], the influences of air ingestion and discharge at moderate rotating speeds will change the nature of the analysis from incompressible to compressible flow. An assumption is put forward that the changes in air-oil mixture density are caused by the effects of the variations in the volume of the tooth space and the gas ingestion and discharge at low or moderate speeds, while at high speeds of tangential linear speed over subsonic speed the changes of density come from the volumetric change.
For a given tooth space, it is regarded as an open system (Fig. 5), delimited by the pinion and gear surfaces, deformable varying with the rotating angle, and having at least one opening allowing a transfer of air- oil mixture. By convention, the mass flow rate is positive when the fluid enters the open system and negative when it exits. The continuity equation for an open tooth space is:

volume ration αam of 0.998 at 38 ◦C. The axial clearance is 1 mm. The orifice and approach width are 5.44 mm and 5.74 mm for the radial
clearance between the pinion or the gear and the shroud is 1 mm, simply as group G1. The orifice and approach width are 3.91 mm and 26.4 mm for the radial clearance is 17 mm, simply as group G2. The rotating speed of the pinion was changed from 0 to about 8700 r/min.

Results and discussion

For the tightly shrouded gears, the total load-independent power losses are the sum of the windage losses and the pumping losses. Ac-

ρ′V = ρV0 + ρπmznb[Sr(i — 1, j) — Sr(i, j) ]	(23) where Sr (i,j), Sr (i-1,j) is the minimum distance between the pinion
and gear profiles at the inlet and outlet of the given tooth space. V0 is the initial volume of tooth space. V is the real-time volume, as the product of the cross-sectional area Sa (i,j) and the gear width b. The changing rate of the tooth space concerning the rotating angle is obtained as:

cording to Hurrell et. al [4], the windage loss was reduced to 2.7 kW and
3.5 kW for groups G1 and G2 at 8681 r/min (25000 ft/min). The reduction coefficient of windage drag losses in Eq. (8) is achieved as

0.091 for group G1, and 0.131 for group G2. Integrating the reduction coefficient into the windage losses and pumping losses formulas, the total resulting load-independent losses is obtained against the rotating speed and compared with the experimental findings, as shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4.
According to the characteristics of the curves in the above figures, there is a great difference between the real experimental load- independent power losses and the anticipated value in theory. In other words, the theoretical prediction method derived from the swept volume of the gear pump already does not apply to the power losses caused by the squeezing/pocketing behavior of the tooth space. There are three big reasons to explain the clear differences. Firstly, the fluid filled with the tooth space is gas (i.e., air or air-oil mixture) instead of liquid, the compressibility of air or air-oil mixture cannot be ignored, especially for the processes of the single-teeth meshing and double-teeth meshing. Secondly, the fluid flow would be changed from subsonic incompressible flow to subsonic compressible flow once the rotating speed exceeds 25,000 ft/min (8681 r/min), where the Mach number is 0.374 over the threshold value of 0.3. Last but not least, the discharge capacity of the

Based on the profile function of the given tooth in Eq. (3) and (4), the

From these changing curves, the minimum distance at the outlet of the tooth space changes to be zero when the root of the pinion tooth

mean values for the minimum distances, cross-sectional area and tooth space volume are adopted and applied to Eq. (23), and the quantity proportion relationship between the mean density and the initial density of the air-oil mixture is obtained. Meanwhile, considering the number of teeth engaged simultaneously, the mean density needs to be multiplied by the contact ratio in Eq. (10).
Following the above assumption, a simplified mean density for pre-
high rotating speed (n ≤ 2000 r/min, ρ′avg = 6.98 kg/m3; n ≥ 8000 r/ dicting the pumping losses will be regarded as a constant at both low and min,ρ′avg = 3.07 kg/m3), with a linear transition at medium speed.
Additionally, the effects of the high tangential speed exceeding 102
m/s at standard atmospheric pressure (Mach number is greater than 0.3) will change the nature of the analysis from subsonic incompressible to subsonic compressible flow. The fluid density for predicting the windage and pumping losses will decrease, expressed as:

Furthermore, following Fondelli et. al. [36], the velocity of the
airflow close to the gear top is about 90 % of the pitch line velocity of the gear. It can also be interpreted as that 90 % of the gas volume sur- rounding the rotating gears for the relatively loose shroud in G2 configuration, is accelerated and sucked into the tooth space. For this case, the swept volume needs to be multiplied by a correction coefficient of 0.9 in Eq. (11).
Integrating these three factors into Eq. (5), (6) and (11), the improved theoretical analytical model of the total load-independent losses for the tightly shrouded meshed gears is finally determined. Then, different kinds of power losses are calculated and compared with experimental values, as depicted in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9. Clearly, the pre- dictions calculated by the improved theoretical method agree well with experimental results, it is indicated that the method is correct and effective. It is also suggested that the quasi-analytical method is capable of predicting the load-independent power losses for the tightly shrouded meshed gears, especially for the shroud that approaches the gears in axial directions.
Meanwhile, the windage losses and pumping losses at different rotating speeds are also illustrated by using the improved analytical model in Fig. 10. Obviously, more than 75 % of the total load- independent losses are from pumping losses, and the contribution of the pumping losses to the total losses is far greater than that of the windage losses in the same configuration at the same rotating speed. As for the different configurations, the proportion of the pumping losses in G1 is slightly larger than that in G2, it is suggested that a tight shroud makes the behavior of the tightly shrouded gears more similar to the gear pump, with better prediction accuracy. When the rotating speed is advanced, the ratio of the pumping losses slightly decreases and that of the windage losses slightly increases, this shows that the windage loss is more sensitive to the rotating speed. In particular, the total load- independent power losses are about 7.5 kW at the rotating speed of 6944 r/min, and 13 kW at the rotating speed of 8681 r/min. This implies that load-independent power losses can be a major source of power losses at high-speed conditions, especially for pumping losses. It is worth pointing out that this theoretical calculation results for each group can be obtained in a few minutes on an ordinary PC (12th Gen Intel(R) Core

Conclusion

Aiming to explore and predict the load-independent power losses mainly including windage power losses and pumping power losses of a shrouded meshed gear pair, a quasi-analytical method based on the concept of the swept volume for the gear pump is established in this paper, avoiding the disadvantages of high cost for experimental in- vestigations and heavy computation for numerical simulations. The correctness and effectiveness of the theoretical model are verified by comparing it with experiments in open literature. Some conclusions are obtained as follows:
Leveraging the swept volume of the gear pump, the squeezing/ pocketing behavior of the air or air-oil mixture in the tooth space of the tightly shrouded meshed gear pair is investigated, thereby the total load- independent power losses are predicted considering the windage and pumping effects. Based on the compressibility of the various in tooth space and subsonic compressible flow, the quasi-analytical model of the total power losses is improved, it is capable of estimating the total losses including the pumping and windage losses, from low speed to high speed. Furthermore, when the pitch line velocity exceeds 127 m/s (8681 r/min), the pumping losses are over 11.3 kW, and it has been a signifi- cant contribution to the total power losses.
However, the quasi-analytical method in this paper is limited to predicting the load-independent losses of the tightly shrouded meshed gears that the gear pair is enclosed with the smallest axial and radial
clearances. The range of applications needs to be concerned and extended in follow-up studies. Furthermore, the end face and circum- ferential sealing of the gear device is significantly worse than that of the gear pump system. The leakage of the lubricating medium is not negli- gible. These factors do have an impact on the model computation pre- cision, especially in the case of a larger clearance between the gears and the shroud. Follow-up studies of this pumping loss model are being planned from two aspects: on the one hand, the influence of the air flow at the import and export of tight shrouded gear pair needs further investigated; on the other hand, The leakage of the lubricating medium at the end face should be focused.
