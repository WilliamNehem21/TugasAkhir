Abstract
We investigate notions of algorithmic randomness in the space C(2N) of continuous functions on 2N. A probability measure is given and a version of the Martin-L¨of test for randomness is defined which
allows us to define a class of (Martin-L¨of) random continuous functions. We show that random Δ0 continuous functions exist, but no computable function can be random. We show that a random function maps any computable real to a random real and that the image of a random continuous
function is always a perfect set and hence uncountable. We show that for any y ∈ 2N, there exists a random continuous function F with y in the image of F . Thus the image of a random continuous function need not be a random closed set.
Keywords: Martin-Lo¨f test, random real, random closed set, random function.

Introduction

The study of algorithmic randomness has been of great interest in recent years. The basic problem is to quantify the randomness of a single real number. Early in the last century, von Mises [16] suggested that a random real should obey reasonable statistical tests, such as having a roughly equal number of zeroes and ones of the first n bits, in the limit. Thus a random real would be stochastic in modern parlance. If one considers only computable tests, then there are countably many such tests and one can construct a real satisfying all tests.
Martin-Lof [14] observed that stochastic properties could be viewed as special kinds of measure zero sets and defined a random real as one which avoids certain effectively presented measure 0 sets. That is, a real x ∈ 2 is Martin-L¨of random if for any effective sequence S1, S2,... of c.e. open sets with μ(Sn) ≤ 2−n, x ∈/ ∩nSn.
At the same time Kolmogorov [11] defined a notion of randomness for finite strings based on the concept of incompressibility. For infinite words, the stronger notion of prefix-free complexity developed by Levin [13], G´acs [9] and Chaitin [5] is needed. Schnorr later proved that the notions of Martin-Lo¨f randomness and Chaitin randomness are equivalent.
In a recent paper [2], the notion of (Martin-Lo¨f) randomness was extended to finite-branching trees and effectively closed sets. It was shown that a ran- dom closed set is perfect, has measure 0, and contains no computable elements. In this paper we want to consider algorithmic randomness on the space
N
C(2 ) of continuous functions F : 2 → 2 .
Some definitions are needed. For a finite string σ ∈ {0, 1}n, let |σ| = n. For two strings σ, τ , say that τ extends σ and write σ ≺ τ if |σ| < |τ | and σ(i) = τ (i) for i < |σ|. Similarly σ ≺ x for x ∈ 2N means that σ(i) = x(i) for i < |σ|. Let σ-τ denote the concatenation of σ and τ and let σ-i denote σ (i) for i = 0, 1. Let x n = (x(0),... , x(n  1)). Two reals x and y may be coded together into z = x  y, where z(2n)= x(n) and z(2n + 1) = y(n) for all n.
For a finite string σ, let I(σ) denote x  2N : σ  x . We shall call I(σ), the interval determined by σ. Each such interval is a clopen set and the clopen sets are just finite unions of intervals. We let denote the Boolean algebra of clopen sets.
Now a nonempty closed set P may be identified with a tree TP ⊆ {0, 1}∗ where TP = {σ : P ∩ I(σ) /= ∅}. Note that TP has no dead ends. That is, if σ ∈ TP , then either σ-0 ∈ TP or σ-1 ∈ TP .
For an arbitrary tree T ⊆ {0, 1}∗, let [T ] denote the set of infinite paths

through T , that is,
x ∈ [T ] ⇐⇒ (∀n)x[n ∈ T.
It is well-known that P	2N is a closed set if and only if P = [T ] for some tree
T . P is a Π0 class, or an effectively closed set, if P = [T ] for some computable

tree T . P is a strong Π0
class, or a Π0
closed set, if P = [T ] for some Δ0

tree. The complement of a Π0 class is sometimes called a c.e. open set. We
remark that if P is a Π0 class, then TP is a Π0 set, but it is not, in general,
1	1
computable. There is a natural effective enumeration P0, P1,... of the Π0
classes and, hence, there is a corresponding enumeration of the c.e. open sets. Thus we say that a sequence S0, S1,... of c.e. open sets is effective if there is a computable function, f , such that Sn = 2N  Pƒ(n) for all n. For a detailed development of Π0 classes, see [3,4].

Random continuous functions
We will define the notion of a random continuous function along similar lines to the definition of a random closed set in [2]. The definition of a random (nonempty) closed set P = [T ] (where T = TP ) comes from a probability measure μ∗ where, given a node σ ∈ T , each of the following scenarios has
3
σ-0 ∈ T and σ-1 ∈ T ,
σ-0 ∈ T and σ-1 ∈/ T , and
σ-0 ∈/ T and σ-1 ∈ T .
More formally, we define a measure μ∗ on the space C of closed subsets of 2N as follows. Given a closed set Q ⊆ 2N, let T = TQ be the tree without dead ends such that Q = [T ]. Let σ0, σ1,... enumerate the elements of T in order, first by length and then lexicographically. We then define the code x = xQ = xT by recursion such that for each n, x(n) = 2 if both σn-0 and σn-1 are in T , x(n)=1 if σn-0 ∈/ T and σn-1 ∈ T , and x(n)= 0 if σn-0 ∈ T and σn-1 ∈/ T . We then define a measure μ∗ on C by setting
μ∗(X )= μ({xQ : Q ∈ X })	(1)
for any X ⊆ C and μ is the standard measure on {0, 1, 2}N. Then Brodhead, Cenzer, and Dashti [2] defined a a closed set Q ⊆ 2 to be (Martin-Lo¨f) random if xQ is (Martin-L¨of) random.
A continuous function on 2N is a function with a closed graph. Thus we might simply say that a function F is random if the graph Gr(F ) is a random closed set. Now Gr(F ) = {x ⊕ y : y = F (x)}. Thus if [T ] is the graph of

a function and σ ∈ T has even length, then we must have σ-0 ∈ T and σ-1 ∈ T . This means that the family of closed sets which are the graphs of functions has measure 0 in the space of closed sets and hence a random closed set will not be the graph of a function. So we need a different measure to define randomness for continuous functions.
A continuous function F : 2N → 2N may be represented by a function
f : {0, 1}∗ → {0, 1}∗ such that the following hold for all σ ∈ {0, 1}∗.
|f (σ)|≤ |σ|.
σ1 ≺ σ2 implies f (σ1) “ f (σ2).
For every n, there exists m such that for all σ ∈ {0, 1}m, |f (σ)|≥ n.
For all x ∈ 2N, F (x)=   f (x[n).
We will define a space of representing functions f : 0, 1 ∗   0, 1 ∗ to be those which satisfy clauses (1) and (2) above. For such a function f , we have f (∅)= ∅ by (1). There are three choices for f ((0)). If f ((0)) = (i) where i ∈ {0, 1}, this means that for all x ∈ I((0)), F (x)(0) = i. If f ((0)) = ∅, we shall take this to mean that there exist x0 and x1 in I((0)) such that F (xi)(0) = i for i = 0, 1. It will always be the case that F (σ) “ τ , where τ is the longest string τ with |τ |≤ |σ| such that τ ≺ F (x) whenever σ ≺ x.
We will use the following measure on the set of representing functions to define randomness. Given that f (σ)= τ , we define a measure μ∗∗ so that each of the following scenarios has equal probability 1 for i = 0, 1:
f (σ-i)= τ ,
f (σ-i)= τ-0, and
f (σ-i)= τ-1.
This can be pictured geometrically as representing the graph of F as the intersection of a decreasing sequence of clopen subsets of the unit square. Initially the choice of f ((0)) and f ((1)) selects from the 4 quadrants. That is, for example, f ((0)) = (0) = f ((1)) implies that the graph of F is included in the lower half of the square. Successive values of f restrict the graph of F in a similar fashion.
Let  be the space of functions f : 0, 1 ∗   0, 1 ∗ which satisfy clauses
(1) and (2) above. Then every continuous function F has a representative f as described above, and, in fact, it has infinitely many representatives. There is a one-to-one correspondence between F and {0, 1, 2}N defined as fol- lows. Enumerate {0, 1}∗ in order, first by length and then lexicographically, as σ0, σ1,.. .. Thus σ0 = ∅, σ1 = (0), σ2 = (1), σ3 = (00),.   Then r ∈ {0, 1, 2}N
corresponds to the function fr : {0, 1}∗ → {0, 1}∗ defined by declarling that

fr(∅)= ∅ and that, for any σn with |σn| ≥ 1,


f (σ
)=  fr(σk),	if r(n)= 2;

	

where k is such that σn = σk-j for some j. The measure μ∗∗ on is then induced by the standard probability measure on 0, 1, 2 N. We now define a effectively random continuous function on 2N to be one which has a represen- tation in  which is effectively random. For the rest of this paper, when we say a function, closed set, or real is random, we mean that it is effectively radom.
Our first result will be to show that every random function represents a continuous function. To prove such a result, we need to prove the following lemma.
Lemma 2.1 Let Σ be a ﬁnite set and let Q ⊆ ΣN be a Π0 class of measure 0.
Then no element of Q is Martin-Lo¨f random.
Proof. We will give a proof only in the case where Σ = {0, 1, 2} as the general result can be proved in a similar manner. Let Q = [T ] where T ⊆ {0, 1, 2}∗ is a computable tree (possibly with dead ends). For each n, let Tn = T ∩ {0, 1, 2}n and let


Let g(n)= μ(Qn
Qn =	{I(σ): σ ∈ Tn}.
)= |Tn| . Then g(n) is a computable sequence and

limn→∞g(n)= μ(Q)= 0.
This Martin-L¨of test shows that Q has no random elements. (As observed by Solovay, it is sufficient for a sequence of c.e. open sets {Sn}n≥0 to be a Martin-L¨of test if limn→∞μ(Sn) = 0 effectively rather than the stricter test with a sequence of measures μ(Sn) ≤ 2 .)	 
Theorem 2.2 The set of functions in F which represent a total continuous function has measure one. Hence every random function represents a contin- uous function.
Proof. Let f ∈ F and suppose that f does not represent a total function. Then there is some x ∈ 2 and some τ ∈ {0, 1} such that f (x[n) = τ for almost all n. Without loss of generality we may assume that τ = ∅. Let A be the set of functions f : {0, 1} → {0, 1} such that f (σ)= ∅ for arbitrarily long strings σ and let p = μ∗∗(A). Then certainly p ≤ 5 since, if r(0) and r(1) are both in {0, 1}, then fr ∈/ A. Considering the 9 cases for the initial choices

of f ((0)) and f ((1)), we see that
p = 4 p + 1 [1 − (1 − p)2]
so that 1 p2 + 1p = 0, which implies that p = 0. That is, there are 4 cases in
9	3
which f ((i)) =1 for i = 0, 1 so that immediately f / A, there are 4 cases in
which only one of f ((i)) = , in which case the remaining function g, defined by g(σ)= f (i-σ) must be in A, and there is one case in which f ((i)) = for i = 0, 1, in which case at least one of the remaining functions must be in A.
Observe that A is a Π0 class since fr ∈ A if and only if (∀n)(∃σ ∈
{0, 1} )fr(σ) = ∅. It follows from Lemma 2.1 that no random function can
be in A and therefore every random function f : {0, 1}∗ → {0, 1}∗ indeed represents a continuous function F : 2N → 2N.	 
Now the set of Martin-L¨of random elements of 0, 1, 2 N has measure one and there exists a Δ0 Martin-L¨of real. Hence we have the following.
Theorem 2.3 There exists a random continuous function which is Δ0 com-
putable.
Next we consider some basic properties of random continuous functions.
Our first result is easy to prove.
Proposition 2.4 (a) F is a random continuous function if and only if, for every σ ∈ {0, 1}∗, the function Fσ is random continuous, where
Fσ(x)= F (σ-x).
F is random continuous if and only if both F(0) and F(1) are random continuous.
Next we shall show that every random function maps a computable real to a random real. Again, we need a preliminary lemma.
Lemma 2.5 Let Σ be a ﬁnite alphabet where |Σ| ≥ 3 and let Σ1 ⊂ Σ be a proper subset of Σ where |Σ1| ≥ 2. If z ∈ ΣN is Martin-Lo¨f random and y is the result of removing from z all symbols from Σ − Σ1, then y is Martin-Lo¨f
1
Proof. Clearly it is enough to prove the lemma when |Σ|− 1 = |Σ1|. Thus there is no loss in generality in assuming that Σ = {1, 2,... ,n + 1} and Σ1 = {1,... , n} where n ≥ 2.
Define the function G so that for any x with infinitely many values of x(m)   1,... , n , G(x) is the result of removing from x all occurences of n + 1.

Claim 2.6 For any Σ0 subset S of {1,... , n}N , μ(G−1(S)) = μ(S).

Proof. [Proof of Claim] Since every Σ0
class S is the effective union of a

disjoint sequence of intervals, that is, there is a computable function f such
that S =	m I(σƒ(m)), it suffices to prove this for intervals I(σ) ⊆ {1,... , n}N . The proof is by induction on the length |σ|.
For m = |σ| = 1, we see that
G−1(I((i))) = I((i)) ∪ I((n + 1)-i)) ∪ I((n + 1)(n + 1)-i) ∪ ··· 
so that
μ(G−1(I((i)))) =   1	 + 	1	 + 	1	 + ··· 
n +1	(n + 1)2	(n + 1)3
1	1	1
= n	(	 1  )=  = μ(I((i))).
+1 1 − n+1	n
Now assume the result to be true for m and let σ = (i)-σ where τ = m. Then it is easy to see that
G−1(I(σ)) = i-G−1(I(τ ))∪(n+1)i-G−1(I(τ ))∪(n+1)(n+1)i-G−1(I(τ ))∪··· .
Thus
μ(G−1(I(σ))) =   1	 μ(G−1(I(τ ))) + 	1	 μ(G−1(I(τ ))) + ··· 
= μ(G−1(I(τ )))(   1	 + 	1	 + ··· )

n +1

= μ(I(σ)).

Now let S0, S1,... be an effective sequence of c.e. open sets with μ(Sm) 2−m. Thus there exists a computable function f such that
Sm = ∪iI(σƒ (i,m)).

Let Rm = G−1(Sm), so that μ(Rm) = μ(Sm) by the Claim. It remains to be checked that the sequence Rm m∈N is an effective sequence of c.e. open sets. Define the computable function g : 1,... ,n + 1 ∗   1,... , n ∗ so that g(σ) is the result of removing from σ all occurences of n + 1. For each i, m define the computable function h such that {σh(j,i,m)}m∈N enumerates
{τ : g(τ )= σƒ(i,m)}. Then
Rn = ∪j,i,mI(σh(j,i,m)).

Thus {Rm}m∈N is a Martin-L¨of test and hence z ∈/ Rm for some m. But then
y ∈/ Sm so that y is random.	 
Theorem 2.7 If F is a random continuous function, then, for any com- putable real x, F (x) is a random real.
Proof. Suppose that F is random with representing function fr, let x be a computable real and let y = F (x). Define the computable function g so that, for each n,
σg(n) = x[n.
By the Von-Mises–Church–Wald Computable Selection Theorem, the sub- sequence z(n) = r(g(n)) is random in 0, 1, 2 N. Now y = F (x) may be computed from z by removing the 2’s. Thus F (x) is random by Lemma 2.5. 
In particular, it follows that if F is random function and x is a computable real, then F (x) is not a computable or even a c.e. real. Hence, a random function F can never be computably continuous and the graph of F is not a Π0 class.
We note that Fouche [8] has used a different approach to randomness for continuous functions connected with Brownian motion, first presented by Asarin and Prokovsky [1], and has shown that, under this approach, it is also true that for any random continuous function F , F (x) is not computable for any computable input x.
Theorem 2.8 If F is a random continuous function, then the image F [2N]
has no isolated elements.
Proof. Let f be the random representing function for F and let Q = F [2N]. Suppose by way of contradiction that Q contains an isolated path y. Then there is some finite τ  y such that y is the unique element of I(τ )  Q. Fix σ such that f (σ)= τ .
For each n, let Sn be the set of all g ∈F such that for all ρ1, ρ2 ∈ {0, 1}n,
g(σ-ρ1) is compatible with g(σ-ρ2),
τ ≺ g(σ-ρ1), and
τ ≺ g(σ-ρ2).
Then for any each m < n and each ρ ∈ {0, 1}m, we are restricted to at most 7 of the 9 possible choices so that in general, μ(Sn) ≤ ( 7)n. Now for each n, Sn is a clopen set in F and thus the sequence S0, S1,... is a Martin-L¨of test. It follows that for some n, F / Sn. Thus there are two extensions of σ of length n which have incompatible images, contradicting the assumption that y was the unique element of Q ∩ I(τ ).	 

It follows that the image of a random continuous function is perfect and has continuum many elements. There are several natural questions about the image F [2N] of a random continuous function F . Is the image of F a random closed set? What is the measure of the image? Can the function be onto? We will give some partial answers.
It follows from Proposition 2.4 that, for any τ ∈ {0, 1}∗, there is a random continuous function with image  I(τ ). Thus a random continuous function is not necessarily onto.
Theorem 2.9 For any σ  0, 1 ∗, the probability that the image of a con- tinuous function F meets I(σ) is always > 3 .
Proof. The proof is by induction on σ . Without loss of generality, we may assume that σ = 0n. For each n > 0, let qn be the probability that F [2N] meets I((0n)). Let f be the representing function for F . For n = 1, there are 9 equally probable choices for the pair f ((0)) and f ((1)) which can be broken down into 4 distinct cases.
Case 1. If f ((0)) = (1) = f ((1)), then F [2N] does not meet I((0)). This occurs just once.
Case 2. If f ((0)) = (0) or f ((1)) = (0), then F [2N] meets I((0)). This occurs in 5 of the 9 choices.
Case 3. If f ((i)) = and f ((1 i)) = (1), then F [2N] meets I((0)) if and only if F(i)[2N] meets I((0)). This occurs in 2 of the 9 choices, with probability q1.
Case 4. If f ((0)) =	= f ((1)), then F [2N] meets I((0)) if at least one of F(i)[2N] meets I((0)). This occurs in 1 of the choices, with probability
1 − (1 − q1)2. That is, F [2N] fails to meet I((0)) if both F	[2N] and F	[2N]
fail to meet I((0)).
Putting these cases together, we see that

5	2
q =	+	q
1
+	(2q
— q ),

so that q1 satisfies the quadratic equation
x2 + 5x − 5= 0.
Thus q1 is the unique solution in [0,1] of this equation, that is,
q = √45 − 5 ,
1	2

which is indeed > .75.
Now let qn = q and let qn+1 = p. Once again we consider the 9 initial choices, now breaking down into 6 distinct cases.
Case 1. If f ((0)) = (1) = f ((1)), then F [2N] does not meet I((0n+1)).
This occurs just once.
Case 2. If f ((0)) = (0) = f ((1)), then F [2N] meets I((0n+1)) if and only if at least one of F(0) and F(1) meets I((0n)). This occurs just once, and with probability 1 − (1 − q)2 = 2q − q2.
Case 3. If f ((i)) = (0) and f ((1  i)) = (1), then F [2N] meets I((0n+1)) if and only if F(i)[2N] meets I((0n)). This occurs in 2 of the 9 choices, with probability q.
Case 4. If f ((i)) = and f ((1  i)) = (1), then F [2N] meets I((0n+1)) if and only if F(i)[2N] meets I((0n+1)). This occurs in 2 of the 9 choices, with probability p.
Case 5. If f ((0)) = ∅ = f ((1)), then F [2N] meets I((0n+1)) if at least one of F(i)[2N] meets I((0n+1)). This occurs just once, with probability 1 −(1 − p)2.
Case 6. If f ((i)) = and f ((1 i)) = (0), then F [2N] meets I((0n+1)) if at least one of the following two things happens. Either F(i)[2N] meets I((0n+1)),

or F(1−i)
[2N] meets I((0n)). This occurs in 2 of the 9 choices, with probability

1 − (1 − p)(1 − q).
Putting these cases together, we see that
p = 2 p − 1 p2 − 2 pq + 2 q − 1 q2,
so that p = qn+1 satisfies the equation
p2 + 3p + 2pq − 6q + q2 = 0.
We note that for p = q, the solutions are p = q = 0 and p = q = 3. This
explains the value 3 in the statement of theorem.
Now assume by induction that q > 3. Suppose by way of contradiction
that p ≤ 3 . It follows that
 9 + 9 + 3 q − 6q + q2 ≥ 0.

Simplifying, this implies that 16q2 − 72q + 45 ≥ 0. But this factors into (4q − 3)(4q − 15) and is only ≥ 0 when either q ≤ 3 or q ≥ 15 . Since the latter

is impossible, we obtain the desired contradiction that q ≤ 3 .	 
Corollary 2.10 For any y ∈ 2N, there exists a random continuous function
F with y ∈ F [2N].
Proof. Let Sn be {F ∈ C(2N) : I(y[n) ∩ F [2N] /= ∅}.	By Theorem 2.9,
μ(Sn) ≥ .75 for all n.NBut Sn+1 ⊆ Sn for all n and therefore μ(∩nSn) ≥ .75
as well. Thus y ∈ F [2 ] with probability ≥ .75. Since the random continuous
functions have measure 1 in (2N), it follows that some random continuous function has y in the image.	 
Corollary 2.11 The image of a random continuous function need not be a random closed set.
Proof. It was shown in [2] that a random closed set has no computable mem- bers. Let F be a random continuous function with 0ω in the image, as given by Corollary 2.10. Then F [2N] is not a random closed set.	 

n-random continuous functions
Our approach also allows us to define the notion of n-random continuous functions. That is, recall that
a Σ0 test is a computable collection {Vn : n ∈ 2N} of Σ0 classes such that
n	n
μ(Vk) ≤ 2−k and

a real α is Σ0 random or n-random if and only if it passes all Σ0
tests,

i.e., if {Vn : n ∈ 2N} is a computable collection of Σ0 classes such that
μ(Vk) ≤ 2−k, then α ∈/ ∩n≥0Vn.
Thus 1-random reals are just Martin-L¨of random reals. See [6] for details on random and n-random reals.
Kurtz [12] and Kautz [10] proved the following result. Let ∅(n) denote the
n-th jump of ∅.
Theorem 3.1 Let q be a rational number.

For each Σ0
class S , we can uniformly compute from q and a Σ0
index

for S, the index of a Σ∅(n−1) class U ⊇ S such that U is an open Σ0
class

1	n
and μ(U ) − μ(S) < q.

For each Π0 class T , we can uniformly compute from q and a Π0
index

for T , the index of a Π∅(n−1) class V ⊇ T such that V is a closed Π0 class
1	n
and μ(V ) − μ(T ) < q.

For each Σ0 class S, we can uniformly compute from q, and a Σ0
index

for S and an oracle for ∅(n), the index of a Π0	class V ⊆ S such that V

is a closed Π0	class and μ(S) − μ(V ) < q. Moreover, if μ(S) is a real
computable from ∅(n−1), then the index for V can be found computably
from ∅(n−1).
For each Π0 class T , we can uniformly compute from q and Π0 index for
T and an oracle for ∅(n), the index of a Σ0	class U ⊆ T such that U
is an open Σ0	class and μ(T ) − μ(U ) < q. Moreover, if μ(S) is a real
computable from ∅(n−1), then the index for U can be found computably
from ∅(n−1).
It follows that a real is n + 1-random if and only if it is 1-random relative to (n). The analogue of Theorem 3.1 also holds for 0, 1, 2 N for our measures μ∗ or μ∗∗. Thus we can define a closed set Q to be n-random if and only if is Martin Lo¨f random relative to (n) and, similarly, we can define a continuous function F : 22N	22N to be n-random if and only if it is Martin L¨of random relative to (n). One can then easily relativize the results of the previous section to obtain similar results for n-random continuous functions.

Conclusions and Future Research
In this paper we have proposed a notion of effective randomness for continuous functions on the Cantor space 2N and derived several properties of effectively

random continuous functions. Effectively random Δ0
continuous functions

exist, but no computable function can be effectively random. In fact, the image
if a computable real under an effectively random function is an effectively random real so that no effectively random function can map a computable real to a computable or even to a c.e. real. We have shown that the image of a random continuous function is always a perfect set and hence uncountable. We have shown that for any y ∈ 2N, there exists a random continuous function F with y in the image of F . Thus the image of a random continuous function need not be a random closed set.
We would like to extend the notion of a random continuous function to functions on the real unit interval [0, 1] and the real line ঩ by representing functions again in terms of the images of subintervals. We conjecture that a random continuous real function cannot be left or right computable and, in fact, it cannot even be weakly computable. We also conjecture that a random continuous function is nowhere differentiable.
