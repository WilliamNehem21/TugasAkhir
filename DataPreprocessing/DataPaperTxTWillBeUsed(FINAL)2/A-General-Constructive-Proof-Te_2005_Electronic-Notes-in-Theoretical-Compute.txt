Abstract
In the constructive theory of uniform spaces there occurs a technique of proof in which the applica- tion of a weak form of the law of excluded middle is circumvented by purely analytic means. The essence of this proof–technique is extracted and then applied to three important problems in the theory of apartness and uniformity.
Keywords: Uniform structure, constructive mathematics.

Introduction
The theory of apartness spaces, a counterpart of the classical theory of prox- imity spaces, appears promising as a foundation for constructive 4 topology. In several of the papers dealing with metric and uniform apartness spaces [5,11,15], we have used ad hoc variants of what appears to be a general proof– technique, which we now outline.
We have N = P ∪ Q, where N is the set of positive integers, and the definition of the sets P, Q depends on certain additional hypotheses. We want to prove that n ∈ P eventually. We first use additional information, such as the strong continuity (see below) of some mapping between uniform spaces, to establish that either n ∈ P holds eventually 5 or else n ∈ Q infinitely often. In order to rule out the second alternative, we then show that it implies a weak form of the law of excluded middle, and that if this weak form of excluded middle is added to intuitionistic logic, then it is contradictory that n ∈ Q infinitely often. It follows from all this that n ∈ P eventually.
In this note we expand these ideas into a surprisingly powerful proof– technique 6 that we then apply to three problems in the constructive theory of uniform spaces. We require only minimal knowledge of that theory, as found in [13]; but to assist the reader, we shall give some of the basic definitions at the start of Section 3.


The proof–technique
Our proof–technique comprises two lemmas and a proposition. The first of these results is a peculiarly constructive one that takes the sting out of a number of succeeding proofs and is made necessary by the constructive failure of what Bishop called the limited principle of omniscience (LPO):
For each binary sequence (λn)n≥1 either λn = 0 for all n, or else there exists
n such that λn = 1.

4 By constructive mathematics we mean mathematics with intuitionistic logic; see [1,2,4,14].
5 Let A be a set of positive integers. We say that n ∈ A eventually, or for all sufficiently large n, if there exists N such that n ∈ A for all n ≥ N, and that n ∈ A infinitely often if we can construct a strictly increasing sequence (nk)k≥1 of positive integers such that nk ∈ A for each k.
6 An earlier paper of ours [7] dealt with a proof technique in uniform space theory. That
technique is strong enough to produce Theorem 3.3 below; but, contrary to the claim made in [7] and subsequently corrected in [8], it is not strong enough for the other two applications in that paper. Moreover, it does not have Ishihara’s proof technique (see Proposition 4.2) as a consequence.


In its recursive interpretation (with classical logic), LPO entails the decidabil- ity of the halting problem ([4], Chapter 3).
Lemma 2.1 Let S be a nonempty set, and H a set of sequences s in S such that if s ∈ H, then each subsequence of s belongs to H. Let T be a subset of S with the following property: if
s ∈ H, N = P ∪ Q, and sn ∈ T for each n ∈ Q,	(1)
then either n ∈ P for all n or else there exists n ∈ Q. If (1) obtains, then either n ∈ P eventually or else n ∈ Q inﬁnitely often.
Proof. In view of our hypotheses, we may assume without loss of generality that there exists n1 ∈ Q. Set λ0 = λ1 = 0. Using dependent choice, we construct inductively an increasing binary sequence (λk)k≥1 and a strictly increasing sequence (nk)k≥1 of positive integers such that for each k > 1,
if λk = 0, then nk ∈ Q, and
if λk = 1 − λk−1, then n ∈ P for all n > nk−1.
To this end, suppose we have found nk−1 with the applicable properties. Define
P ' = {j ≥ 1 : nk−1 + j ∈ P }, Q' = {j ≥ 1 : nk−1 + j ∈ Q},

and

s' = sn



k−1

+j j≥1 .

Then s' ∈ H, by our first hypothesis, and N = P ' ∪ Q'. Moreover, if j ∈ Q',

then nk−1 + j ∈ Q and so s'
∈ T. Applying our hypotheses with P, Q, s

replaced by P ', Q', s' respectively, we see that either n ∈ P for all n > nk−1, in which case we set nk−1+j = nk−1 + j for each j ≥ 1, and λk = 1; or else there exists nk > nk−1 with nk ∈ Q, and we set λk = 0. This completes our inductive construction.
Now let
P '' = {k ∈ N : λk = 0 ∨ λk−1 = 1} , Q'' = {k ∈ N : λk = 1 − λk−1} ,

and

s'' = sn



k−1

 k≥2 .

We see that s'' ∈ H and that N = P '' ∪ Q''. Moreover, if k ∈ Q'', then

nk−1 ∈ Q, and s'' = sn

k−1
∈ T. Applying our hypotheses with P, Q, sk replaced

by P '', Q'', s'' respectively, we see that either k ∈ P '' for all k or else there

exists k ∈ Q''. In the first case, if λj = 1 − λj−1 for some j, then j ∈/
P '',

a contradiction; whence λk = 0 for all k, and therefore (nk)k≥1 is a strictly


increasing sequence of elements of Q. In the case there exists k ∈ Q'', we have
n ∈ P for all n > nk−1.	 


Our next lemma may seem bizarre, since it shows that under certain hy- potheses the nonconstructive proposition LPO holds. However, it enables us to use LPO to rule out the unwanted second alternative in the conclusion of Lemma 2.1.
Lemma 2.2 Under the hypotheses of Lemma 2.1, if n ∈ Q inﬁnitely often, then LPO holds.
Proof. Choose a strictly increasing sequence (nk)k≥1 in Q, and note that snk ∈ T for all k. Consider any increasing binary sequence (λk)k≥1 . Applying Lemma 2.1 with P, Q, sk replaced by
P ' = {k ∈ N : λk = 0} ,
Q' = {k ∈ N : λk = 1} ,
'
and snk respectively, we find that either k ∈ P  for all k or else there exists
k ∈ Q'.	 
Proposition 2.3 Under the hypotheses of Lemma 2.1, let s ∈ H, let N =
P ∪ Q, and suppose that sn ∈ T for each n ∈ Q. Suppose also that
LPO ⇒ ¬ (∀n∃k > n (k ∈ Q)) .

Then n ∈ P eventually.
Proof. By Lemma 2.1, either n ∈ P eventually or else n ∈ Q infinitely often. In the second case, Lemma 2.2 shows that LPO holds, which, in view of our final hypothesis, is absurd.	 


In order to apply the foregoing, we need to set up suitable S, H, T and show that if s ∈ H, N = P ∪ Q, and sn ∈ T for each n ∈ Q, then either n ∈ P for all n or else there exists n ∈ Q. It will then follow from Proposition 2.3 that n ∈ P eventually.

Continuity, convergence, and uniformity
Let X be a nonempty set, and let U, V be subsets of the Cartesian product
X × X. We define certain associated subsets as follows:


U ◦ V = {(x, y) : ∃z ∈ X ((x, z) ∈ U ∧ (z, y) ∈ V )}, U 1 = U,	Un+1 = U ◦ Un	(n = 1, 2,.. .),
U −1 = {(x, y) : (y, x) ∈ U }.
We say that U is symmetric if U = U −1. The diagonal of X × X is the set
∆ = {(x, x) : x ∈ X}.

A family U of subsets of X × X is called a uniform structure, or uni- formity, on X if the following conditions hold.
U1 I Every finite intersection of sets in U belongs to U.
II Every subset of X × X that contains a member of U is in U.
U2 Every member of U contains both the diagonal ∆ and a symmetric member of U.
U3 For each U ∈ U there exists V ∈ U such that V 2 ⊂ U .
U4 For each U ∈ U there exists V ∈ U such that

∀x ∈ X × X (x ∈ U ∨ x ∈/ V ) .

The pair (X, U) —or, loosely, X alone—is called a uniform space, and the elements of U the entourages of X. For clarity, we sometimes denote the uniform structure on X by UX. The motivating example of a uniform space is a metric space (X, ρ) , in which the unique uniform structure has a basis of sets of the form
{(x, y) ∈ X × X : ρ (x, y) ≤ ε}	(2)
with ε > 0.
Condition U1, and the fact that, by U2, each element of U is nonempty, show that U is a filter on X × X. Classically axiom U4 is superfluous (we simply take V = U ); but constructively it is essential for the development of the theory. A good reference for the classical theory of uniform spaces is [3].
The (uniform) topology on a uniform space (X, U) is the one in which a base of neighbourhoods of a point x ∈ X consists of the sets

U [x] = {y ∈ X : (x, y) ∈ U }	(U ∈ U) .

A topology τ on a set X is said to be given by the uniform structure U
on X if it coincides with the uniform topology arising from U.
We define a canonical inequality on a uniform space (X, U) by

x /= y ⇔ ∃U ∈ U ((x, y) ∈/ U ) .


Note that, by axioms U1II and U2, if U ∈ C , then U −1 ∈ C . It follows that if x /= y, then y /= x. Moreover, since C contains ∆, if x /= y, then ч (x = y) . Thus /= has the two properties that define an inequality relation in constructive mathematics. In turn, the inequality on X induces an associated inequality on X × X in the usual way. Note that an apparently stronger form of axiom U4 holds: for each U ∈ C there exists V ∈ C such that
6x ∈ X × X x ∈ U V x ∈ CV ,

where
CV = {x ∈ X × X : 6v ∈ V (x /= v)}
is the complement of V in X × X.
For each positive integer n we define an n–chain of entourages of X to be an n–tuple (U1,... , Un) of entourages such that for each applicable k, Uk is symmetric, U 2 ⊂ Uk−1, and
6x ∈ X × X x ∈ Uk−1 V x ∈ CUk .
Axiom U3 ensures that for each U ∈ C and each positive integer n there exists an n–chain (U1,... , Un) of entourages with U1 = U.
We state two technical lemmas about uniform spaces for later use; these appear, with proofs, as Lemmas 7 and 8 of [7].
Lemma 3.1 Let Y be a uniform space, let (an)n≥1 , (bn)n≥1 be sequences in Y, and let (V1, V2, V3) be a 3–chain of entourages of Y such that (an, bn) ∈ CV1 for each n. Then it is impossible that for each n, (an, bk) ∈ V3 for all suﬃciently large k.
Lemma 3.2 Assuming LPO, let (an)n≥1 and (bn)n≥1 be sequences in a uni- form space Y, and let (V1,... , V4) be a 4–chain of entourages of Y, such that (an, bn) ∈ CV1 for each n. Then there exists a strictly increasing sequence (nk)k≥1 of positive integers such that (anj , bnk ) ∈ CV4 for all j and k.

We say that two subsets A, B of a uniform space (X, C) are apart, and we write A da B, if there exists an entourage U such that
A × B ⊂ CU = {x ∈ X × X : 6y ∈ U (x /= y)} .


Two sequences (xn)

n≥1
and (x' )
in X are eventually close if for each

entourage U of X we have (xn, x' ) ∈ U eventually. A mapping f from X into a uniform space Y is


strongly continuous if for all subsets A, B of X,
f (A) da f (B) ⇒ A da B;
uniformly sequentially continuous if for all sequences (xn)n≥1 and

(x' )n≥1 that are eventually close in X, the sequences (f (xn))
n≥1
and

(f (x' ))
n≥1
are eventually close in Y.

These two types of continuity are weak forms of uniform continuity. We aim to prove the following result, whose metric space version is in [5].
Theorem 3.3 A strongly continuous mapping between uniform spaces is uni- formly sequentially continuous.
Our proof will require yet more lemmas.
Lemma 3.4 Let X, Y be uniform spaces, f : X → Y a strongly continu- ous function, and V an entourage of Y. Let (λn)n≥1 be an increasing binary sequence, and (An)n≥1 , (Bn)n≥1 sequences of subsets of X such that
D for each entourage U of X there exists N such that for each n ≥ N, either
An × Bn = ∅ or else An × Bn intersects U ;
D if λn = 0, then An = ∅; and
D if λn = 1 − λn−1, then An /= ∅, Bn /= ∅, f (An) × f (Bn) ⊂ CV, and Ak = ∅
for all k > n.
Then there exists N such that λn = λN for all n ≥ N.
Proof. Note that if λ1 = 1, then there is nothing to prove. Writing
A =  n≥1An,
B =  n≥1 {Bn : λn = 1 − λn−1} ,
we see that f (A) × f (B) ⊂ CV : for if x ∈ A, then there exists n such that A = An,B = Bn, and f (An) × f (Bn) ⊂ CV. Hence f (A) da f (B) and therefore, by the strong continuity of f, there exists an entourage U of X such that A × B ⊂ CU. Choose N such that for each n ≥ N, either An × Bn = ∅ or else An × Bn intersects U. Either λN = 1 and therefore λn = 1 for all n ≥ N, or else λN = 0. In the latter case, if λm = 1 − λm−1 for some m > N, then A = Am /= ∅,B = Bm /= ∅, and A × B intersects U. This contradicts our choice of U ; whence λn = 0 for all n ≥ N.	 
Lemma 3.5 Let X, Y be uniform spaces, f : X → Y a strongly continuous function, and V an entourage of Y. Let S be the space X × X,
H = s ∈ SN : 6U ∈ CX ∃N 6n ≥ N (sn ∈ U )} ,



and
T = (x, x') ∈ S : (f (x),f (x')) ∈ CV } .

If s ∈ H, N = P ∪ Q, and sn ∈ T for each n ∈ Q, then either n ∈ P for all n
or else there exists n ∈ Q.
Proof. For each n write sn = (xn, x' ) . Construct an increasing binary se-
quence (λn)n≥1 such that
if λn = 0, then k ∈ P for all k ≤ n;
if λn = 1 − λn−1, then n ∈ Q.
We may assume that λ1 = 0. If λn = 0, set An = Bn = ∅. If λn = 1 − λn−1,
set An = {xn} and Bn = {x' } , and note that, as n ∈ Q, we have (xn, x' ) ∈ T
n	n
and therefore f (An) × f (Bn) ⊂ CV ; also set Ak = ∅ = Bk for each k ≥ n. Now consider any entourage U of X. Since s ∈ H, there exists ν such that (xn, x' ) ∈ U for all n ≥ ν. For each such n, if λn = 0 or λn−1 = 1, then An × Bn = ∅. On the other hand, if λn = 1, then An × Bn = {(xn, x' )} ⊂ U. Thus the hypotheses of Lemma 3.4 are satisfied. Applying that lemma, we produce N such that λn = λN for all n ≥ N. If λN = 0, then n ∈ P for all n; whereas if λN = 1, there exists k ≤ n such that k ∈ Q.	 

To prove Theorem 3.3, let S = X × X, and define H as in the preceding

lemma. Given two sequences (xn)
n≥1
'
n n≥1
in X that are eventually close,

let s = ((xn, x' ))
n≥1
. Let V be any entourage of Y, and construct a 5–chain

(V1,... , V5) of entourages of Y with V1 = V. Define
P = {n : (f (xn),f (x' )) ∈ V },
Q = {n : (f (xn),f (x' )) ∈ CV2},

and
T = (x, x') ∈ S : (f (x),f (x')) ∈ CV2} .

Then N = P ∪Q, s ∈ H, and sn ∈ T for each n ∈ Q. It follows from Lemmas 3.5 and 2.1 that either n ∈ P eventually or else n ∈ Q infinitely often. Supposing that n ∈ Q infinitely often, we see from Lemma 2.2 that LPO holds. Thus,
by Lemma 3.2, there exists a strictly increasing sequence (nk)k≥1 of positive
integers such that f (xn ),f (x' ) ∈ CV5 for all j, k. Writing
j	nk
A = xnj : j ≥ 1} , B = x	: k ≥ 1} ,
'

we see that f (A) × f (B) ⊂ CV5, so f (A) da f (B) in Y. Since f is strongly continuous, A da B in X, and therefore there exists an entourage U of X such
that A×B ⊂ CU. But this is absurd, since xn , x'  ∈ U eventually. Referring


to Proposition 2.3, we conclude that n ∈ P —that is, (f (xn),f (x' )) ∈ V —
eventually. This completes the proof.

It is shown in [11] that Theorem 3.3 is the best we can produce construc- tively without introducing a principle that, while valid in the standard models (intuitionistic, recursive, classical) of constructive mathematics, appears not to be derivable using only intuitionistic logic and dependent choice. Under certain additional hypotheses, Theorem 3.3 can be strengthened to produce the uniform continuity of the strongly continuous function f ; see [5].
The uniform continuity theorem for continuous mappings from compact metric spaces into metric spaces follows easily from Theorem 3.3 with classical logic. In the same way, a standard classical result about uniform convergence can be obtained from our next application of Proposition 2.3. This needs more definitions.
Let X be a nonempty set, Y a uniform space, (φn)n≥1 a sequence in Y X,
and φ ∈ Y X. We say that (φn) is proximally convergent to φ if

φ(A) da B ⇒ ∃N 6n ≥ N (φn(A) da B); 

and that (φn) is uniformly sequentially convergent to φ if for each se- quence (xn)n≥1 in X, the sequences (φ(xn))n≥1 and (φn(xn))n≥1 are eventually close. We want to prove the following theorem which first appeared in [15].
Theorem 3.6 Let X be a nonempty set, Y a uniform space, and (φn)n≥1 a sequence in Y X that converges proximally to φ ∈ Y X. Then (φn) is uniformly sequentially convergent to φ.
To do this, we need counterparts of Lemmas 3.4 and 3.5.
Lemma 3.7 Let X be a nonempty set, and Y a uniform space. Let (φn)n≥1 be a sequence in Y X that converges proximally to φ ∈ Y X. Let (xn)n≥1 be a sequence in X, and V an entourage of Y. Let (λn)n≥1 be an increasing binary sequence, and (An)n≥1 , (Bn)n≥1 sequences of subsets of X, Y respectively, such that
D if λn = 0, then An = Bn = ∅, and
D if λn = 1 − λn−1, then An = {xn} , Bn = {φn(xn)} , φ(An) × Bn ⊂ CV, and
Ak = Bk = ∅ for all k > n.
Then there exists N such that λn = λN for all n ≥ N.
Proof. Write


A =   n≥1An,
B =  n≥1 {Bn : λn = 1 − λn−1} .
If x ∈ A, then there exists n such that A = An = {xn} , B = Bn = {φn(xn)} , and φ(An) × Bn ⊂ CV. Hence φ(A) × B ⊂ CV and therefore φ(A) da B. By proximal convergence, there exists N such that φn(A) da B for all n ≥
N. Suppose that λm = 1 − λm−1 for some m > N. Then A = {xm} ,B =
{φm(xm)} , and φm(xm) da φm(xm), which is absurd. Hence λn = λN for all
n ≥ N.	 
Lemma 3.8 Let X be a set, and Y a uniform space. Let (φn)n≥1 be a sequence in Y X that converges proximally to φ ∈ Y X. Let (xn)n≥1 be a sequence in X, and V an entourage of Y . Let P, Q be sets of positive integers such that N = P ∪ Q, and suppose that (φ(xn), φn(xn)) ∈ CV for all n ∈ Q. Then either n ∈ P for all n or else there exists n ∈ Q.
Proof. Construct an increasing binary sequence (λn)n≥1 such that
if λn = 0, then k ∈ P for all k ≤ n;
if λn = 1 − λn−1, then n ∈ Q.
We may assume that λ1 = 0. If λn = 0, set An = Bn = ∅. If λn = 1 − λn−1, set An = {xn} and Bn = {φn(xn)} , and note that, as n ∈ Q, we have φ(An) × Bn ⊂ CV ; also set Ak = ∅ = Bk for each k ≥ n. By Lemma 3.7, there exists N such that λn = λN for all n ≥ N. If λN = 0, then n ∈ P for all n; if λN = 1, then n ∈ Q for some n ≤ N.	 


To prove Theorem 3.6, given a set X and a uniform space Y, let S = X×Y X and H = SN. Let (φn)n≥1 be a sequence in Y X that converges proximally to φ ∈ Y X, let U be an entourage of Y, and construct a 5–chain (U, V1, V2, V3, V4) of entourages of Y . Define
T = (x, f ) ∈ S : (φ(x),f (x)) ∈ CV1} .

Let (xn)n≥1 be a sequence in X, and let s = ((xn, φn))n≥1 ∈ H. Define
P = {n : (φ(xn), φn(xn)) ∈ U } ,
Q = n : (φ(xn), φn(xn)) ∈ CV1} .
Applying Lemmas 3.8 and 2.1, we see that either n ∈ P eventually or else n ∈ Q infinitely often. Suppose that there exists a strictly increasing sequence (nk)k≥1 of positive integers in Q. Then LPO holds, by Lemma 2.2, so we can


apply Lemma 3.2 with
ε
ak = φ (xnk ) , bk = φnk (xnk ) , and r = 2 ,

to construct a strictly increasing sequence (ki)∞
of positive integers such that




Let
 φ xnkj , φnki xnki  ∈ CV4	(i, j ≥ 1) .	(3)

A = xnki : i ≥ 1, ,
B = φnkj  xnkj  : j ≥ 1, .

We see from (3) that φ(A) da B. Hence there exists N such that φn(A) da B
for all n ≥ N. In particular, for all i ≥ N we obtain the contradiction

φnki xnki da φnki xnki .
Thus
ч (6n∃k > n (k ∈ Q)) ,
and so, by Proposition 2.3, n ∈ P eventually. That is, (φ(xn), φn(xn)) ∈ U for all sufficiently large n. This completes the proof.

Ishihara’s tricks
In the seminal paper [12], Hajime Ishihara introduced two lemmas, subse- quently dubbed Ishihara’s tricks, that have had many significant applications in constructive analysis. These lemmas were examined in a more general set- ting in [9]. We end this paper by showing that they are also related to our
foregoing proof–technique. We first prove a slight generalisation of Ishihara’s first trick ([12], Lemma 1) that sets up our application of Proposition 2.1.
Lemma 4.1 Let X be a complete metric space, x ∈ X, and f a strongly ex- tensional mapping of X into a metric space Y. Let H be the set of all sequences in X that converge to x, let α > 0, and deﬁne
T = {y ∈ X : ρ (f (x),f (y)) > α} .
If (xn)n≥1 ∈ H, N = P ∪ Q, and xn ∈ T for all n ∈ Q, then either n ∈ P for all n, or else there exists n ∈ Q.
Proof. Suppose that (xn)n≥1 ∈ H, N+ = P ∪ Q, and xn ∈ T for all n ∈ Q.
Construct an increasing binary sequence (λn)n≥1 such that


if λn = 0, then k ∈ P for all k ≤ n;
if λn = 1 − λn−1, then n ∈ Q.
We may assume that λ1 = 0. If λn = 0, set yn = x. If λn = 1−λn−1, set yk = xn for all k ≥ n. Then (yn)n≥1 is a Cauchy sequence in X and so converges to a limit y ∈ X. Either ρ (f (x),f (y)) > 0 or ρ (f (x),f (y)) < α. In the first case, since f is strongly extensional, we have x /= y. So there exists N such that
x /= yN , from which it follows that λN = 1 and hence n ∈ Q for some n ≤ N. In the case ρ (f (x),f (y)) < α we must have λn = 0, and therefore n ∈ P, for all n.	 

We now easily deduce Ishihara’s second trick ([12], Lemma 2).
Proposition 4.2 Let X be a complete metric space, f a strongly extensional mapping of X into a metric space Y, and (xn)n≥1 a sequence converging to a limit x ∈ X. Then for all positive α, β with α < β, either ρ(f (xn),f (x)) < β eventually or else ρ(f (xn),f (x)) > α inﬁnitely often.
Proof. Take S = X, and let H and T be defined as in the statement of Lemma
That lemma shows that the hypotheses of Lemma 2.1 hold. Applying that lemma with
P = {n : ρ(f (xn),f (x)) < β} ,
Q = {n : ρ(f (xn),f (x)) > α} ,
we immediately obtain the desired conclusion.	 

Thus our proof–technique can be viewed as a strong extension of Ishihara’s ideas in [12], lifting them from the restrictive context of a complete metric space to a general setting that permits applications such as the ones we have given in the theory of uniform spaces.
