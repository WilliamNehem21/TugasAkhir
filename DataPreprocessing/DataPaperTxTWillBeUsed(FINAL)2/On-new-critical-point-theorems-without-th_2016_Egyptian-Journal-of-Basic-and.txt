Introduction

The weak Ekeland variational principle is an important tool in critical point theory and nonlinear analysis, and in this paper
Lemma 1 (Weak Ekeland variational principle). Let (E, d) be a complete metric space and let  : E  ℝ be a lower semicontinuous functional, bounded from below. Then for every ε > 0, there exists a point u*  E such that

we will use this principle to establish some new results in criti- cal point theory.

Preliminaries

We need the following weak Ekeland variational principle which can be found for example in Ref. 1.
Definition 1. We say that a functional   C1 E, R has a se- quence of almost critical points if there exists a sequence vn n in E such that φ′(vn) → 0 in E* as n → ∞.

Lemma 2 (Minimization principle). ( [2]) Let E be a Banach space and  : E  ℝ a functional, bounded from below and Gâteaux dif-
ferentiable. Then, there exists a minimizing sequence vn n of almost critical points of φ in the sense that

Then φ is lower semicontinuous and bounded from below on J′(E). Let ε ∈ (0, 1). From the weak Ekeland variational prin- ciple, there exists u* in E such that

Theorem 1. Let E be a reflexive Banach space, Ω be a bounded and weakly closed set of E with J  C1 E, ℝ, and let J′ be strongly con- tinuous on Ω. Suppose also that J satisfies J u E*  k Ju E*
We deduce that u* is a critical point of J. If this is not true
then Ju*  0. Let (vn) the sequence of almost critical point of J. Then we obtain that

As a consequence of the last theorem, we obtain the fol- lowing corollary.

Remark 1. The two geometric conditions in the Mountain pass theorem suffice to get a sequence of almost critical points (see Ref. 2).

Corollary 1. Let E be a Banach space, and let J  C1 E, ℝ satisfy J(0) = 0. Assume that J′(E) is a closed set in E* and there exist posi- tive numbers ρ and α such that

J(u) ≥ α if u   ,
there exists e ∈ E such that e   and J(e) < α.

Corollary 3. Let E be a Banach space, and let J  C1 E, ℝ with J′(E) a closed set in E*. Suppose that J is bounded from below. Then J has at least one critical point.

Proof. The minimization principle ensures the existence of almost critical points. The conclusion follows from Theorem 2. ■
Ω is weakly closed, u ∈ Ω. Let C be the constant of the con- tinuous embedding of H1(0, 1) in L2(0, 1). We have

Corollary 4. Let E be a reflexive Banach space, let Ω a bounded and weakly closed subset of E with J  C1 E, R, and let J′ be strongly continuous on Ω. Suppose also that J admits a sequence of almost critical point in Ω. Then J has at least one critical point in
Ω.

We consider the functional J defined on E  H1 0, 1 by

where f  C 0, 1  ℝ, ℝ is a continuous function. Suppose that there exist a function  : R  R and k ∈ ]0, 1[ such that

Finally we show J′ satisfies

One may take as examples of f and ϕ,
u ∈ Ω, where φ is the Nemytskii’s operator associated with ϕ.
Now from (f1) we have

where q is a positive function defined on [0, 1].
 k sup  f t, u t h t dt

h H1 1 0

Theorem 3. Suppose that f satisfies (f1). Then J has at least one criti- cal point.

Proof. Note that J is well defined and J  C1 H1 0, 1, R with

From Theorem 1, J has at least one critical point in Ω.
