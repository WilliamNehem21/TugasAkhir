Introduction

Blue-green algae (Cyanobacteria) are group of Gram-negative photoautotrophic prokaryotes that contain a blue-green colored pigment (c-phycocyanin). Cyanobacteria have a fossil history from
3.3 to 3.5 billion years ago [1]. The cyanobacteria can be found in nearly all the imaginable habitats such as fresh and salty water, polluted waters of lakes, ponds, water tanks, soil, rocks and tree barks. Its morphological form varies from unicellular to filamen- tous or colonial forms [2]. Some cyanobacterial species are ther- mophilic and growing in thermal springs [3]. Some cyanobacteria are environmentally-friendly and have the ability to fix atmo- spheric nitrogen and solubilize phosphate [4]. Cyanobacteria are considered as a rich source of primary metabolites such as polysac- charides, proteins, fats, oils, vitamins, pigments and hydrocarbons [5]. They are also a rich source of many secondary metabolites like

the antifungal cyclic peptides in Tolypothrix byssoidea [6,7], the
algicidal phenolic compound 4,4' dihydroxybiphenyl and the indol antibacterial diterpenoids compounds in Nostoc commune [8], the alkaloid norharmane in Nostoc insulare and Nodularia harveyana,
respectively [9]. There are a lot of intracellular and extracellular metabolites with diverse biological activities as antiviral [10], anti- cancer, anti-inflammatory, cytotoxic [11] and immunosuppressive agents. The production of extracellular antibiotic metabolites by marine microalgae and screening for other pharmacologically active compounds had been studied in past few decades [12]. In addition to that foregoing, there are many other important com- pounds with antioxidant activity like ascorbic acid, reduced glu- tathione, phenolic compounds and flavonoids [13]. Furthermore,
photosynthetic pigments which consist of two classes, chlorophylls (a &b chlorophyll) and carotenoids. Carotenoids that contain oxy- gen known as xanthophylls like lutein, zeaxanthin, canthaxanthin, b-cryptoxanthin and astaxanthin; while that are only hydrocar-
bons are known as carotenes like b-carotene and lycopene [14]. Sinha et al. [15] reported that the screening programs of cyanobac-

terial biomass have led to discovery of new compounds with antimicrobial, antineoplastic and cytotoxic activities. The use of non-conventional microorganism in biotechnology had attracted

much interest in recent years [16]. The conventional optimization 	
of production factors is usually a time uncontrollable and labor- intensive process. On the contrary, statistically designed two level-factorial experiments, had been proved to be valuable tools for optimizing microbial culture conditions [17]. The objective of this study was to apply Response surface methodology (RSM) to evaluate the effects of the medium composition for attaining the highest bioactive compounds production by cyanobacterium Ana- baena oryzae.

Materials and methods


Culture preparation and isolation of micro-organism

Cyanobacterium Anabaena oryzae was isolated from the rice fields in Egypt. The soil samples were collected, air-dried, ground to pass a 2-mm sieve. Soil samples were transferred into Petri- dishes, wetted by sterilized distilled water and incubated under fluorescent illumination for three weeks. The formed mats were inculcated into modified (BG-11) medium [18], and the mat was re-cultured several times to new solid BG-11 plates and incubated under continuous illumination using white fluorescent light inten-
sity of 2000–2500 lux for three weeks at 26 ± 2 °C, with regular
microscopic examination.
Modified BG-11 medium was used in the present study and its final pH after autoclaving and cooling was 7.4.

Alga identification

Cyanobacterium Anabaena oryzae was identified according to Desikachary [19] and the samples were prepared according to the procedure described by Cronberg [20] using light microscope
at 100× oil immersion lens.
Maintenance medium for alga

The Anabaena oryzae alga was maintained on BG-11 medium, 250 ml of algal culture was transferred to 500 ml Erlenmeyer flasks. The flasks were exposed to a light/dark cycle of 14/10 h, respectively at room temperature, left to grow and harvested after 2 weeks by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 10 min.

Optimization of the bioactive compounds production based on multi-factorial experiments

The Plackett–Burman experimental design, [21] an efficient technique for optimization of the factors affecting active com- pounds’ production was used to reflect the relative importance of various chemical factors on bioactive compounds production.
This model does not describe the interaction between the fac- tors, but was used to screen and evaluate the important media components that influence the production of antibacterial compounds.
Eight independent variables (Table 1) were screened in thirteen runs organized according to the Plackett–Burman design matrix as indicated in Table 2. The studied factors were: NaNO3, K2HPO4, MgSO4, CaCl2, citric acid, ammonium ferric citrate, ethylene diaminetetraacetic acid disodium magnesium salt (EDTA-Na2Mg)
and Na2CO3. For each variable, a high level (+) and low level (—)
were tested, which represents two different nutrient concentra-
tions. The trials were performed in triplicate using 250 ml Erlen- meyer flasks and final data was calculated as the mean of triplicate.

Cell growth and determination of cell dry weight

The growth of Anabaena oryzae was determined by measuring the optical density of the algal suspension at wavelength 660 nm for 7 days using spectrophotometer (UV-200-RSLW scientific) [22]. The algal biomass can be determined by measuring its dry weight. The pellets were washed with distilled water, recen-
trifuged and kept for drying at 60 °C till constant weight [23].

Preparation of alga extract

One hundred mg of alga was soaked in 5 ml petroleum ether (60–80 °C) for 48 h and filtrated; the precipitate was soaked in dichloromethane for the same period and repeated for the last time in methanol.

Analysis of bioactive compounds

The methanol extracts of Anabaena oryzae were used for the tannin, flavonoids, total phenol content, antioxidant, ascorbic acid and pigments analyses.

Total phenolic content (TPC)

Total phenolic content was performed by Folin-Ciocalteu method [24]. Distilled water (3.16 ml) was mixed with the 40 ll of sample and then 200 ll of Folin Ciocalteu reagent was added. After 5 min, 600 ll of 20% sodium carbonate solution (Na2CO3) was added and solution mixed again. The solution was left at room
temperature for 2 h. The color intensity was measured using spec- trophotometer at wavelength 750 nm. The total phenol content was compared to with gallic acid standard curve according to the formula:
TPC (mg/g)= C × V/g
where;
C = concentration of the gallic acid equivalent from standard curve (mg/mL),
V = volume of the extract used (ml), g = weight of extract (g).

Pigments estimation

A known volume of culture was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 minutes, after that the algal pellets were treated with known volume of methanol and kept in water bath for 30 min at 55 °C, then centrifuged again. The color of pellets must be white to ensure complete extraction of pigments. Absorbance was measured at 666, 653 and 470 nm. Calculations were made according to the for-

mula devised by Costache [25] for chlorophyll (a) and carotenoids estimation.

Chlorophyll (a) = 15.65 Ab 666-7.340 Ab653 Carotenoids = 1000 Ab 470-2.860 Chlorophyll (a)

Flavonoid content determination

The flavonoid content of Anabaena oryzae extract samples were determined according to the aluminum chloride method described by Barku [26]. One ml of sample solution of alga extract was added to 0.5 ml of distilled water. About 0.075 ml of 5% sodium nitrite solution was then added to the mixture followed by incubation for 6 min after which 0.15 ml of 10% aluminum chloride was added, shaked and left to stand for 6 min, 0.5 ml of 1 M sodium hydroxide was finally added and the mixture was diluted with
0.275 ml distilled water, shaked and left to stand for 15 min before absorbance reading, using the sample solution without coloration as reference solution. The absorbance of the reaction mixture was measured at 500 nm.
Flavonoid content was expressed as mg of quercetin equivalent (QE)/g dry weight.

Antioxidant capacity

Antioxidant activity of Anabaena oryzae extract was determined by the ability of extract to scavenge 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH)radicals [27]. One hundred ll of test extract was mixed
centration causing a 50% reduction of DPPH absorbance was expressed as the half maximal inhibitory concentration (EC50) value.


Vanillin – HCL assay

Sample (0.2 g) of dried Anabaena oryzae biomass was extracted with 10 ml of methanol for 24 h at 30 °C. One ml of the resulting extract was reacted with 5 ml of vanillin reagent 50:50 (mixture of 1% vanillin:8% HCl in methanol) for 20 min at 30 °C, and absor- bance was measured at 500 nm. For the control sample, vanillin reagent was replaced with 5 ml of 4% HCl in methanol. Blank value was subtracted from experimental value to give adjusted data.
Tannic acid standard curve from 0.0–1.0 mg/ml was used in cal- culating tannin levels [28].


Ascorbic acid content

Ascorbic acid content of Anabaena oryzae was estimated accord- ing to the method of Loeffler and Ponting [29]. Ten ml of 2,6- dichlorophenol indophenol dye solution was added to 5 ml of 100 mg of dried Anabaena oryzae biomass then was extracted by 6% HPO3, vortexed well and the red color was measured within 15–20 second at 518 nm.
Ascorbic acid standard curve was used in calculating mg of ascorbic acid per g of dry sample according to the formula:

Mg of ascorbic acid per g of dry sample =	Ascorbic acid content ×volume made up × 100
ml of solution taken for estimation× 1000 × weight of sample taken (0.1 g)


with 1 ml of methanolic solution of 0.1 mM DPPH. The mixture was vortexed and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in dark. The absor- bance of the samples was measured at 517 nm.
Lower absorbance of the reaction mixture indicated higher free radical scavenging activity which was calculated using the follow- ing equation:
DPPH scavenging effect (%)= 100 × (A◦ — A1)/(A◦)
where: A° is the absorbance of the control reaction and A1 is the
absorbance of reaction mixture.
Percentage of the DPPH scavenging activity was plotted versus the different concentrations of sample extract used and the con-
Statistical analysis

Statistical were carried by using Minitab 16 software.

found in experimental trial no. 10 (0.256 mg/ml), whereas mini- mum concentration of phenol was in trial no. 8 (0.097 mg/ml).
Statistical results of eight tested medium variables in case of the phenol production revealed that K2HPO4 and ferric ammonium citrate had a negative effect, other variables had a positive effect and in general there was no significant effect between medium
variables on phenol production by Anabaena oryzae at P ≤ 0.05
(Fig. 1).
In case of chlorophyll (a) and carotenoid pigments production, maximum concentration of chlorophyll (a) was found in trial no. 10 (47.7 µg/ml) and minimum concentration was found in experi- mental trial no. 6 (1.7 µg/ml), while maximum carotenoid pigment production also was present in trial 10 (4.11 µg/ml). Statistical results of eight tested medium variables in case of the chlorophyll
(a) revealed that ferric ammonium citrate and citric acid had a sig- nificant positive effect, while in carotenoid pigment production, NaNO3, citric acid and ferric ammonium citrate had a significant positive effect. The results revealed that MgSO4, K2HPO4 and CaCL2 variables had a significant negative effect in chlorophyll (a) pro- duction while MgSO4 and CaCL2 had that effect in production of carotenoid, respectively (Figs. 2 and 3).
The highest record of total flavonoid content was observed in trial no. 10 (1.83 µg/ml). (Fig. 4) shows that both NaNO3 and citric acid variables had a significant positive effect on the production of flavonoids.
All experimental trials have a scavenging activity toward the DPPH reagent; however the trial no. 10 exhibited the highest scav- enging activity (62.81%). It was found that among the eight inves- tigated medium variables, EDTA, citric acid and NaNO3 had positive main effects on antioxidant capacity (Fig. 5); while the K2HPO4 and

Statistical results of eight tested medium vari- ables in tannin production revealed that K2HPO4 and MgSO4 vari- ables had a significant negative effect; and citric acid, ferric ammonium citrate and EDTA had a positive effect, respectively (Fig. 6).

The maximum concentration of ascorbic acid was 4.82 mg/ml in trial no. 12, from the statistical results represented in (Fig. 7). The main effect of the eight different factors in the Plackett -Burman experimental design, the p-value and the significant of the differ- ent factors that affect ascorbic acid production showed that, NaNO3, MgSO4 and EDTA have negative main effects on the ascor- bic acid content, while the other factors have positive main effects on the ascorbic acid content. Statistical analysis also estimated that NaNO3, MgSO4, EDTA and Na2CO3 were significant variables on
production of ascorbic acid by Anabaena oryzae at P ≤ 0.05.
Among the eight nutrient components used in this study,
K2HPO4, MgSO4 and citric acid had contributed to a large extent for most bioactive compounds production.
The chlorophyll (a) and carotenoid pigments, antioxidant capacity, flavonoid content and tannin content yields were increased in the presence of high concentration of citric acid and low concentrations of K2HPO4 and MgSO4.
NaNO3 was effective in higher level in increasing concentration of carotenoid pigments, flavonoid content and antioxidant capac- ity; while ferric ammonium citrate was effective in case of chloro- phyll (a), carotenoids and tannic acid production. On the other hand the CaCl2 was the most important medium variable in lower level in increasing of chlorophyll (a), carotenoid pigments and per- centage of antioxidant activity.
The Plackett–Burman experimental design has been used to evaluate the components of BG-11 medium, affecting the produc- tion of active constituents like the phycocyanin. MgSO4 and ferric ammonium citrate were found to be the effective components affecting the phycocyanin production [30]. Bloor and England [31], studied the increasing of nitrate from its base level of
8.8 mM to 26.4 mM which increased the antibiotic production by Nostoc muscorum. However, increasing the concentration of iron from its base level of 5 mM to15 mM caused a dramatic decrease in antibiotic production. Similar results obtained by Ohta et al.
[32] who reported that the increase in magnesium and phosphate concentrations cause increase in antibiotic production from Chloro- coccum strain HS-101, whereas, the antibiotic production from Chlorococcum strain HS-101 increased by 1.8- fold in the optimized BG-11 medium than in the standard BG-11 and also the antibiotic production from the alga Dunaliella primolecta increased by 2.3- fold in the optimized BG-11 medium. Yin et al. [33] stated that changes in phosphate, nitrate, calcium, irradiance and temperature all caused quantitative, but not qualitative, changes in toxin com- position produced by the Cyanobacterium Lyngbya wollei where, lower phosphate, nitrate and higher calcium levels gave rise to higher biomass and toxicity. Lower calcium or phosphate deficient medium and high nitrate or phosphate caused a large decrease in dry weight and toxicity. The results obtained from Plackett–Bur- man experimental design stated that the highest main effect and t-value obtained by NaCl was significant variable within seven independent variable, so the effect of NaCl on the antifungal activ- ity of Spirulina platensis is the highest and positive [34].


Conclusion

Blue-green algae Anabaena oryzae was used in this work for bioactive compounds production using modified blue-green med-



ium (BG-11). Eight independent factors including NaNO3, K2HPO4, MgSO4, CaCl2, citric acid, ammonium ferric citrate, ethylene dia- mine tetra acetic acid disodium magnesium salt (EDTA-Na2Mg) and Na2CO3 surveyed considered as more and effective variables for the production of chlorophyll (a) and carotenoid pigments, phe- nols, flavonoids, tannins. Also increased the antioxidant capacity of the algal extract. The Plackett–Burman experimental design, an efficient technique for optimization of the factors affecting active constituent’s production was used to reflect the relative impor- tance of various chemical factors on bioactive compounds production.
