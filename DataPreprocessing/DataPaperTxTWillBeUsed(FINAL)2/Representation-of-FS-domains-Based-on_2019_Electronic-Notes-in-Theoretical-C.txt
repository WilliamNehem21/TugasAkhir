Abstract
In this paper, we propose the notion of FS-closure spaces by incorporating an additional structure into a given closure space, which provides a concrete representation of FS-domains. Furthermore, we prove that the category of FS-closure spaces with approximable mappings as morphisms is equivalent to that of FS-domains with Scott-continuous functions as morphisms.
Keywords: FS-domain, FS-closure space, Closure operator, Categorical equivalence.


Introduction
A closure space is a pair (X, γ) consisting of a set X and a closure operator γ on X, where the closure operator is an isotone, extensive and idempotent map on the powerset of X. Closure spaces have played an important role in restructuring lat- tices and various order structures. The technique by adding a special structure into a given closure space may be traced back to the early works of Birkhoff’s famous representation theorem for finite distributive lattices [3] and Stone’s duality theorem for Boolean algebras [9]. These famous results also encourage researchers to investi- gate the interrelation between lattices and closure spaces. In [4], Edelman obtained that a lattice is meet-distributive if and only if it is a lattice of closed sets of closure space with the anti-exchange property. Ern´e [5] developed a uniform approach to representing various complete lattices by closure spaces from the categorical view- point. Guo and Li [7] proposed the notion of F-augmented closure spaces by adding a family of finite subsets into the closure space, which essentially establishes the

representation of algebraic domains. Recently, Wang and Li [8] discuss the relation- ship between continuous domains and closure spaces. They introduce the notion of F-augmented generalized closure spaces by adding a map into a given closure space, and give a concrete representation of continuous domains.
FS-domains were introduced by A. Jung in [1,2], and proved that the category of FS-domains is a maximal Cartesian closed full subcategory of continuous domains. As is well known, a Cartesian closed category is of great significance that as a formal system with the same expressive power as a typed λ-calculus. Based on the basic fact, in this paper, we focus on the representation of FS-domains.
The paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we recall some basic notions in domain theory. In Section 3, we introduce the concept of FS-closure spaces. Moreover, we prove that every FS-domain arises as the set of F-regular open sets of some FS-closure space. In Section 4, we obtain the main result that the category of FS-closure spaces with approximable mappings as morphisms is equivalent to that of FS-domains with Scott-continuous functions as morphisms.
Preliminaries
For any set X, we write F ± X to mean that F is a finite subset of X. P(X) and 7 (X) are always used to denote the powerset of X and the family of all finite subsets of X, respectively. Let (L, ≤) be a poset. A subset D of L is called directed, if it is nonempty and every finite subset of D has an upper bound in D. We use HD to denote the least upper bound of a directed subset D. A poset is called a dcpo if every directed subset has a least upper bound. Given x, y ∈ L, we say x is way below y (in symbol x  y) if for any directed subset D ⊆ L with HD exists, y ≤ HD always implies x ≤ d for some d ∈ D. For any x ∈ L, we use ↓x to denote the set
{y ∈ L | y  x}. A subset B ⊆ L is called a basis of L if for every x ∈ L, ↓x ∩ B is a directed subset and x = H(↓x ∩ B). A dcpo is a continuous domain if it has a basis.
′
Definition 2.1 [6] A function f : L → L between dcpos is said to be Scott-
continuous if for any directed subset D of L, f (HD)= Hf (D).
′	′
We denote by [L → L ] the set of all Scott-continuous functions from L to L .
Definition 2.2 [6] Let L be a dcpo.
An approximate identity for a dcpo L is a directed set Ð⊆ [L → L] satisfying sup Ð = 1L, the identity on L.
A Scott-continuous function f : L → L is ﬁnitely separating if there exists a finite set Mf such that for each x ∈ L, there exists m ∈ Mf such that f (x) ≤ m ≤ x.
L is called an FS-domain if there is an approximate identity for L consisting of finitely separating functions.
Lemma 2.3 [6] Let L be a dcpo.

′
If Ð⊆ [L → L] is an approximate identity for L, then Ð = {f  = f◦f : f ∈ Ð}
is also an approximate identity.
If f ∈ [L → L] is finitely separating, then f (x)  x for all x ∈ L.
Definition 2.4 [8] Let (X, γ) be a closure space. A pair (X, τ ◦ γ) is called a generalized closure space, if τ ◦ γ is the composition map of γ and τ , where τ is a map on P(X) satisfies the following conditions, for any A, B ⊆ X:
τ (γ(A)) ⊆ γ(A);
τ (τ (γ(A))) = τ (γ(A));
τ (γ(A)) ⊆ τ (γ(B)) whenever A ⊆ B. For simplicity, we write ⟨A⟩ for τ (γ(A)).
Definition 2.5 [8] Let (X, τ ◦ γ) be a generalized closure space and 7 a nonempty family of finite subsets of X. The triplet (X, τ ◦ γ, 7 ) is called an F-augmented generalized closure space if, for any F ∈7 and M ± ⟨F⟩, there exists F1 ∈7 such that M ⊆ ⟨F1⟩ and F1 ⊆ ⟨F⟩.
Definition 2.6 [8] Let (X, τ ◦ γ, 7 ) be an F-augmented generalized closure space. A nonempty subset U of X is called an F-regular open set of (X, τ ◦ γ, 7 ) if, for any M ± U , there exists some F ∈7 such that M ⊆ ⟨F⟩⊆ U .
For convenience, we use R(X) to denote the family of all F-regular open sets of (X, τ ◦ γ, 7 ).
Proposition 2.7 [8] Let (X, τ ◦γ, 7 ) be an F-augmented generalized closure space.
For any F ∈ 7, ⟨F⟩ is an F-regular open set of (X, τ ◦ γ, 7 ).
U is an F-regular open set of (X, τ ◦ γ, 7 ) if and only if {⟨F⟩| F ∈ 7,F ⊆ U}
is directed and U = S{⟨F⟩ | F ∈ 7,F ⊆ U}.
If {Uj}j∈J is a directed family of F-regular open sets of (X, τ ◦ γ, 7 ), then
j∈J Uj is an F-regular open set of (X, τ ◦ γ, 7 ).
Theorem 2.8 [8] Let (X, τ ◦ γ, 7 ) be an F-augmented generalized closure space. Then (R(X), ⊆) is a continuous domain.
Given a continuous domain (L, ≤) with a basis BL, for any A ⊆ BL, define
γ(A)= ↓A ∩ BL,τ (A)= ↓A ∩ BL.

Let 7L be the family of all finite subsets of BL with a greatest element under the induced order ≤. Then for any F ∈ 7L, we have ∨F ∈ F and
⟨F⟩ = (↓ ∨ F ) ∩ BL.
Theorem 2.9 [8] Let (L, ≤) be a continuous domain with a basis BL. Then (BL,τ◦ γ, 7L) is an F-augmented generalized closure space. And (L, ≤) is isomorphic to (R(BL), ⊆).

Theorem 2.11 [8] The category DOM of continuous domains with Scott- continuous functions is equivalent to the category FGC of F-augmented generalized closure spaces with approximable mappings.
FS-closure spaces
In this section, we give a special type of F-augmented generalized closure space which is called FS-closure space, and use this notion to obtain the representation of FS-domains.
Definition 3.1 An FS-closure space is an F-augmented generalized closure space (X, τ ◦ γ, 7 ) which satisfies: there exists a directed family {Θj}j∈J of approximable mappings for (X, τ ◦ γ, 7 ) such that :
Sj∈J Θj = idX ,
For every Θj, we have a finite subset family Mj ⊆7 such that for each F ∈ 7, there exists M ∈ Mj, F Θjx implies M ⊆ ⟨F⟩ and x ∈ ⟨M⟩.
Throughout this paper, we use R(X) to denote the family of all F-regular open sets (Definition 2.6) of FS-closure space (X, τ ◦ γ, 7 ).
Theorem 3.2 Let (X, τ ◦ γ, 7 ) be an FS-closure space. Then (R(X), ⊆) is an FS-domain.
Proof. Theorem 2.8 has shown that (R(X), ⊆) is a continuous domain. To finish the proof, it is sufficient to show that there is an approximate identity for R(X) consisting of finitely separating functions. By hypothesis, there exists a directed family {Θj}j∈J of approximable mappings for (X, τ ◦ γ, 7 ) satisfies the conditions in Definition 3.1. For every Θj, define φΘj : R(X) → R(X) by φΘj (U ) = {x ∈ X | (∃F ∈ 7)F ⊆ U & F Θjx}. From [8, Theorem 4.4], we know that φΘj is a Scott-continuous function.
We firstly prove that {φΘj }j∈J is an approximate identity for R(X). The di- rectivity of {φΘj }j∈J just follows immediately from the definition of φΘj . Suppose

U ∈ R(X), we have
(supj∈J φΘj )(U )= supj∈J φΘj (U )
=  φΘj (U )
j∈J
=  {x ∈ X | (∃F ∈ 7) F ⊆ U & F Θjx}
j∈J
= {x ∈ X | (∃F ∈ 7) F ⊆ U & (F, x) ∈   Θj}
j∈J
= {x ∈ X | (∃F ∈ 7) F ⊆ U & F idXx}
= {x ∈ X | (∃F ∈ 7) F ⊆ U & x ∈ ⟨F⟩}
= U.
This means that supj∈J φΘj = idR(X).
We now prove that φΘj is finitely separating for every j. By Definition 3.1, for every Θj, we have a finite subset family Mj ⊆ 7 such that for each F ∈ 7, there exists M ∈ Mj, F Θjx implies M ⊆ ⟨F⟩ and x ∈ ⟨M⟩. Suppose U ∈ R(X), from Proposition 2.7, we obtain that U =  {⟨F⟩ | F ∈ 7,F ⊆ U} and {⟨F⟩ | F ∈ 7,F ⊆ U} is directed. Set Ð  = {⟨F⟩ | F ∈ 7,F ⊆ U, M ∈ M , ∀F Θ x ⇒ M ⊆
⟨F⟩ & x ∈ ⟨M⟩}. It follows that U = S SM∈Mj ÐM and SM∈Mj ÐM is directed.
Since Mj is a finite subset family of 7 , there is a M0 ∈ Mj such that ÐM0 is a
cofinal subset of S	′
M∈Mj ÐM . We denote Mj = {⟨M⟩ | M ∈ Mj}. It is clear
′
that Mj is a finite subset family of R(X). We finish the proof by checking that
φΘj (U ) ⊆ ⟨M⟩ ⊆ U for some M ∈ Mj. In fact, suppose x ∈ φΘj (U ), then there exists F ∈ 7 such that F ⊆ U and F Θjx. It follows that ⟨F⟩ ⊆ ⟨F0⟩ for some F0 ∈7 and ⟨F0⟩∈ ÐM0 . Therefore, φΘj (U ) ⊆ ⟨M0⟩⊆ U .	2
Given an FS-domain L, and its approximate identity {φj}j∈J for L consisting of finitely separating functions. For every φj, define a relation Θφj ⊆ 7L × L by
F Θφ x ⇔ x  φ2(∨F ).
j	j
Lemma 3.3 Let L be an FS-domain. Then Θφj is an approximable mapping on
(L, τ ◦ γ, 7L) for every j ∈ J.

′
Proof. From Definition 2.10, suppose that F, F
′
∈ 7L and F Θφj F . Then by the

2	′	′

definition of Θφj , we have x  φj (∨F ) for every x ∈ F . Since F
is finite and

′	′	′	2	′
∨F ∈ F , it follows that ∨F  φj (∨F ). Thus F Θφj ⟨F ⟩.
′′	′′	2
Let F ± ⟨F ⟩ and F Θφj M , then x  ∨F	and m  φj (∨F ) for every x ∈
2	2	′′	2	′′

F, m ∈ M . As φj is order-preserving, φj (∨F ) ≤ φj (∨F
′′
). Thus m  φj (∨F
) for

any m ∈ M , which implies F Θφj M .
Assume that F Θφ M , then m  φ2(∨F ) for all m ∈ M . By the interpolation
j	j
property, there exists a ∈ L such that m  a  φ2(∨F ). Notice that φj(∨F ) = 
φj(∨(↓ ∨ F )) = ∨φj(↓ ∨ F ). Moreover, φ2(∨F ) = ∨φ2(↓ ∨ F ), then there exists
j	j

b ∈ ↓ ∨ F such that a   φ2(b). Set G = {b} and G′
= {a}. It is clear that

′	′	′
G, G ∈ 7L such that G ⊆ ⟨F⟩,M ⊆ ⟨G ⟩ and GΘφj G .	2
Theorem 3.4 Let (L, ≤) be an FS-domain. Then (L, τ ◦ γ, 7L) is an FS-closure space. Moreover, (L, ≤) is order isomorphic to (R(L), ⊆).
Proof. By Theorem 2.9, (L, τ ◦ γ, 7L) is an F-augmented generalized closure space and (L, ≤) is order isomorphic to (R(L), ⊆). Then it suffices to prove that {Θφj }j∈J satisfies the conditions in Definition 3.1. From Lemma 3.3, we know that Θφj is an approximable mapping on the F-augmented generalized closure space (L, τ ◦ γ, 7L) for ever j ∈ J . We claim that {Θφj }j∈J is a directed family with respect to inclusion
order. For any Θφj , Θφj  where j1, j2 ∈ J , by definition of Θφj , for any (F, x) ∈ Θφj
if and only if x   φ2 (∨F ) for i = 1, 2. Because {φj}j∈J is directed, there exists
j ∈ J such that φj1 , φj2 ≤ φj. Now we prove that Θφj , Θφj  ⊆ Θφj for this j.
Indeed, suppose (F, x) ∈ Θφ , i = 1, 2, then x  φ2 (∨F ) ≤ φ2(∨F ), which implies

ji
(F, x) ∈ Θφj . Thus Θφj , Θφj
i	S	1	2
⊆ Θφj .
ji	j

Since ∨F = supj∈J φ2(∨F ), there exists j ∈ J such that x   φ2(∨F ). Thus
j	j
(F, x) ∈ Sj∈J Θφj . Conversely, if (F, x) ∈ Sj∈J Θφj , then (F, x) ∈ Θφj for some
j ∈ J . It follows that x   φ2(∨F )   ∨F . Hence x ∈ ↓ ∨ F = ⟨F⟩. Therefore,
(F, x) ∈ idL.
For every j ∈ J , since φj is finitely separating function of L, there exists a finite subset Mj ⊆ L such that for each x ∈ L, there is m ∈ Mj such that φj(x) ≤ m ≤ x. We set Mj = {{φj(m)} | m ∈ Mj}, then Mj ⊆ 7L is a finite subset family. For every F ∈ 7L, there is m ∈ Mj such that φj(∨F ) ≤ m ≤ ∨F . If F Θφj x, which implies x  φ2(∨F ) ≤ φj(m) ≤ φj(∨F )  ∨F . Therefore, {φj(m)} ⊆ ⟨F⟩ and x ∈ ⟨{φj(m)}⟩.	2

The	categorical	equivalence	between	FS-closure spaces and FS-domains
In this section, we investigate the connection between approximable mappings and Scott-continuous functions. Moreover, we establish the equivalence between FS- closure spaces and FS-domains from the categorial point of view.
Given an FS-closure space (X, τ ◦ γ, 7 ), define a relation idX ⊆7 × X by (F, x) ∈ idX ⇔ x ∈ ⟨F⟩.
′	′	′	′
Given two approximable mappings Θ : (X, τ ◦ γ, 7 ) → (X ,τ  ◦ γ , 7 ) and

F (Θ ◦ Θ)x ⇔ (∃G ∈7 ) (F ΘG & GΘ x ).

Proposition 4.1 FS-closure spaces and approximable mappings form a category that is denoted as FSC.

′	′	′
(F, x ) ∈ Θφ ⇔ x   φ (∨F ).

Then Θφ is an approximable mapping from (L, τ ◦ γ, 7L) to (L ,τ ◦ γ , 7L′ ).

Conversely, suppose (X, τ ◦ γ, 7 ) and (X ,τ ◦ γ , 7 ) be FS-closure spaces. For

′	′	′
φΘ(U )= {x ∈ X | (∃F ∈ 7) F ⊆ U & F Θx }.
′
Then φΘ is a Scott-continuous function from (R(X), ⊆) to (R(X ), ⊆).
Proof. The proof is similar to that of [8, Theorem 4.4, Theorem 4.6].	2
Proposition 4.3 F : FSC → FSdom is a functor which maps every FS-closure

space (X, τ ◦ γ, 7 ) to R(X) and approximable mapping Θ: (X, τ ◦ γ, 7 ) → (X ,τ ◦

γ , 7 ) to φΘ : R(X) → R(X ), where φΘ is deﬁned in Lemma 4.2.
Proof. Based on Theorem 3.2 and Lemma 4.2, F is well-defined. We check that F
preserves the identity morphism. For any U ∈ R(X),
F(idX )(U )= φidX (U )
= {x ∈ X | (∃F ∈ 7) F ⊆ U & (F, x) ∈ idX}
= {x ∈ X | (∃F ∈ 7) F ⊆ U & x ∈ ⟨F⟩}
= U
= idR(X).

Θ an approximable mapping from (X ,τ

′′	′	′′
x ∈ F(Θ ◦ Θ)(U ) ⇔ x ∈ φΘ′ ◦Θ(U )

⇔ (∃F ∈ 7,G ∈7 ) F ⊆ U & F ΘG & GΘ x
′	′ ′′
⇔ (∃G ∈7 ) G ⊆ φΘ(U ) & GΘ x
⇔ x′′ ∈ F(Θ′ )(F(Θ)(U )).

′	′
It implies F(Θ ◦ Θ) = F(Θ ) ◦ F(Θ).
Now, we obtain the main result of this paper.
Theorem 4.4 FSC and FSdom are categorically equivalent.
Proof. According to Theorem 3.4, it is sufficient to show that the functor F is full and faithful.
′	′	′	′
We claim that F is full. Let (X, τ ◦γ, 7 ) and (X ,τ ◦γ , 7 ) be FS-closure spaces.
′	′
For any Scott-continuous map φ : R(X) → R(X ), define a relation Θφ ⊆ 7 × X
by

F Θφx

⇔ x ∈ φ(⟨F⟩).

It is straightforward to check that Θφ is an approximable mapping from (X, τ ◦γ, 7 )
′	′	′	′
to (X ,τ ◦γ , 7 ). Now we only need to prove that F(Θφ)= φ. Suppose U ∈ R(X),
F(Θφ)(U )= φΘφ (U )

= φ(  {⟨F⟩ | F ∈7 & F ⊆ U})
= φ(U ).
This implies that F is full.
′
We claim that F is faithful. Suppose that Θ, Θ be two approximable mappings
′	′	′	′
from (X, τ ◦ γ, 7 ) to (X ,τ ◦ γ , 7 ) such that φΘ = φΘ′ . For any F ∈ 7 and

′	′
x ∈ X , we have



′	′
(F, x ) ∈ Θ ⇔ (∃G ∈ 7)G ⊆ ⟨F⟩ & GΘx
′
⇔ x ∈ φΘ(⟨F⟩)
′
⇔ x ∈ φΘ′ (⟨F⟩)
′	′
⇔ (F, x ) ∈ Θ .


Then Θ=Θ , and hence F is faithful.	2
