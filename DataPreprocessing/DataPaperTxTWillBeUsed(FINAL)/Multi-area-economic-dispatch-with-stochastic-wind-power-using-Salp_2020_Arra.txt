Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA) is a newly developed swarm intelligence based optimization method. Its analytical model mimics self-organized swarming and foraging behavior of salps. Salps are found in the ocean and they form a swarm called salp chain for their organized movement and foraging. Since its inception in 2017, SSA has been applied to many engineering domains. This paper presents the solution of complex constrained multi-area eco- nomic dispatch problem of power system with and without stochastic wind integration using SSA. Simulation analysis has been carried on four different constrained test cases with diverse dimensions/complexity level. They are (i) four area system with sixteen thermal units (ii) four area system with forty thermal units (iii) two area system with forty thermal units and (iv) two area forty-unit system with wind integration. Comparison of simulation results obtained by SSA with other methods reported in the recent literature has proven SSA’s capability of constrained handling and offered promising and efficient solutions.







Introduction

Due to rising complexity and the size of real-world optimization problems Bio-inspired optimization approaches became very popular in past decade among researchers of almost all application domains. The Bio-inspired optimization techniques are stochastic in nature and they apply randomness for searching the solution. The randomness helps in the development of a gradient-free search mechanism. Most of these optimization techniques are inspired by natural phenomena and they can be grouped either based on evolution, collective behaviour (swarm- based), ecological phenomenon, physical science. These algorithms have proven their great potential to deal with real-world optimization prob- lems. The classification of Bio-inspired optimization methods is pre- sented in Fig. 1.
Evolution based algorithm utilises the concept of natural evolution such as reproduction, mutation, recombination and selection. Some of the popular optimization method in this category are genetic algorithms (GA) [1], differential evolution (DE) [2] and backtracking search algo- rithm(BSA) [3].
In fact among bio-inspired optimization methods swarm intelligence
based optimization approaches are quite popular and efficient. The key features of swarm intelligence (SI) based algorithms are self-organization and division of work to achieve a given task. For Example, Particle swarm optimization (PSO) [4] simulates biological behaviour of fish schooling and bird flocking, artificial bee colony (ABC) [5] optimization simulates collective foraging behaviour of honey bees, whale optimization algo- rithm (WOA) [6] follows behaviour of humpback whales, grasshopper optimization (GOA) [7] follows their unique swarming behaviour, spider monkey optimization(SMO) [8] mimics the fission-fusion social structure of spider monkeys, grey wolf optimizer (GWO) [9] mimics the hunting behaviour and social leadership of grey wolf, TLBO [10] models the ef- fect of the influence of a teacher on the output of students in the class- room and many others.
The next class of bio-inspired optimization methods belongs to opti- mization methods inspired by the concept of physical Sciences. The most popular and efficient optimization methods in this class are simulated annealing (SA) [11] inspired by annealing process of metal, Harmony search (HS) [12] follows the concept of jazz’s improvisation process and then the search of the perfect state of harmony by musician, Gravitation search algorithm(GSA) [13] utilises the concept of Newton’s law of gravitation and laws of motion, chemical reaction optimization (CRO)

These are the popular algorithms that belong to the family of ecological process-based optimization.
A detailed review and applications of bio-inspired techniques for the solution of different types of constrained complex practical optimization problems can be found in Ref. [20–24]. These include applications related to medical science, job shop scheduling, image processing, parameter estimation, power, and energy. Economic dispatch (ED) is one of the most complex constrained optimization problems of the integrated power system [25]. The main aim of ED is to allocate the power demand among the committed generator units in the most economical manner
while satisfying all the physical and operational constraints. The practical ED problem is highly non-linear and non-convex with multiple minima due to practical operational constraints like valve point loading (VPL) effects, discontinuous due to prohibited operating zones (POZ) and ramp rate limits (RRL). Over the past decades various single area ED problems considering VPL effect [26–31], RRL [27,30,32,33] and POZ [32,34–36] were solved without considering transmission constraints.
However, many utilities have their own limitations for power flows among different areas/regions over transmission lines. Every area/region has its own load pattern and power generation characteristics. Multi-area economic dispatch (MAED) is an extension of ED, where the objective is to calculate power generation as well as the exchange of power between different areas at minimum cost while satisfying additional power transmission capacity constraints along with all equality and inequality constraints associated with ED problems. Due to the additional trans- mission line power flow limit constraints, MAED problem becomes more complex to solve. Therefore, for the solution of such a complex con- strained optimization problem a latest and efficient bio-inspired opti- mization approach is required.
Various bio-inspired optimization algorithms were reported in the literature for the solution of MAED problems [37–50]. The solution of a



single objective MAED problem with different dimension and complexity levels are found in Ref. [37–47]. They are harmony search (HS) [37,38], differential evolution(DE) [39], artificial bee colony (ABC) [40], flower pollination algorithm(FPA) [42], particle swarm optimization (PSO) [44], hybrid cuckoo search algorithm(HCSA) [45], hybrid differential evolution based PSO (DEPSO) [41] and moth-flame optimization(MFO) [43]. Considering clean air policy and global warming concept, solution of multi-objective MAED problems are also presented using PSO [48], chaotic artificial bee colony (CABC) [49] and improved Jaya algorithm (IJA) [50].
In the present scenario, the Integration of wind and solar energy among renewable energy resources is gaining wide acceptance due to their emission-free low-cost operation. However, as wind speed is un- certain therefore, uncertainty associated with wind power is incorpo- rated in objective function using a mathematical model called probabilistic density function (pdf). Out of many pdf models, Weibull distribution [21,51,52], beta distribution [53] and gamma distribution
[54] are used by researchers to calculate cost due to random wind power. The effect of large wind power integration in MAED problems is investigated for a combined wind-thermal system for Taiwan power system using a direct search approach (DSA) in Ref. [55], where 52 unit
thermal systems were used with cost function as a second-order poly-
Practically due to VPL effects ripples are introduced in the cost function, which can be modelled by adding rectified sine function in it, and represented as:

Wind power modeling’

Wind power is a stochastic variable due to uncertain wind speed. Therefore power generation by wind farm includes three types of costs:
(i) direct cost, (ii) overestimation cost/reserve cost which is included due to deficit in wind power and (iii) the underestimation cost/penalty cost which is taken into account due to more wind power generation than the scheduled power [21,51–56]. Therefore the cost of jth wind generator in itharea can be represented as
fwij P ij = bw;ij × P ij + kp Pwav;ij — P sij + kr P sij — Pwav;ij	(4) Reserve cost/overestimation cost of wind power is represented as:

the backtracking search algorithm (BSA) in Refs. [56].
Even though various optimization techniques are proposed for the solution of MAED problems, according to No Free Lunch Theorem [57], none of the algorithms can guarantee to solve all optimization problems. There is always a chance of improvement; keeping that in mind, this paper presents the Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA) for the solution of MAED

this paper. The paper also presents Weibull pdf model for the calculation of wind power. In order to validate the performance of SSA over MAED problem, four cases with different dimensions and complexity levels which possess non-linear, multimodal, non-convex, discontinuous and probabilistic modal due to wind integration are evaluated.

Rest of the paper is organized as follows: formulation of the problem that combines the concept behind MAED, wind power modeling and the related constraints are described in section 2. Section 3 presents the concept behind the SSA, its foraging behavior using an analytical model and implementation procedure for the solution of MAED problem. Description of test cases, effect of control parameters, simulation results and their discussion are presented in section 4. Finally, conclusions are drawn in section 5.

Salp swarm algorithm

Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA) is a recent bio-inspired optimization technique [58], inspired by navigation and foraging behaviour of salp chain, generally found in deep oceans. In its mathematical model, salp population is divided into two groups called leader and followers. The best salp (best solution) is considered as the food source to be followed by the salp chain. After every iteration, the leader salp changes its position with respect to the food sources. The leader explores and exploits the search space around the best solution and the follower salps move

The MAED problem given in section 2 is solved using above explained SSA algorithm. The implementation process of SSA to solve MAED problems is depicted with the help of flowchart given in Fig. 4.

Description of test cases and simulation results

The performance of SSA is evaluated and validated on four standard test cases of MAED problems with different dimensions and complexity levels. SSA has been implemented in MATLAB13 environment and executed on 2.40GHz, i5 processor with 8GB RAM and is simulated over 30 independent runs for all test cases. Description of test cases and the outcome of simulation results obtained by SSA are presented below.
Test Case I: This test case has four areas. Each area consists of four power generating unit systems connected using six tie lines [37]. The fuel cost coefficient data, tie-line power flow limits along with area wise power demands are listed in Table A1. The network topology used in this test case with four areas consisting of sixteen power generating units system is shown in Fig. 5.
The simulation results obtained by SSA in terms of area wise optimum generation scheduling are listed in Table 1 and the comparison of costs with other metaheuristics is summarized in Table 2. The optimum gen- eration cost obtained by SSA is 7337.0139 $/hr. Fig. 6 shows the smooth and stable cost convergence characteristic obtained by SSA.
Test Case II: It is a comparatively large dimension test case with forty power generator units having non-convex fossil fuel cost characteristics with multiple minima. Transmission loss is not considered here. The fuel cost coefficients data and power generation limits are listed in Table A2 as reported in Ref. [26]. The total load demand is set at 10500 MW. Here forty power generating units are segregated in four areas. Each area with ten power generating units shares power demand as 1575MW (15%) in area one, 4200MW (40%) in area two, 3150MW (30%) in area three, and 1575MW (15%) in area four respectively [40].
The tie-line power flow limitations are considered as follows: (i) be- tween area 1 to area 2 or from area 2 to area 1 is 200MW, (ii) between

convergence characteristic for a larger test system obtained by SSA is presented in Fig. 7.
Test Case III: It has a two-area system with forty thermal power generating units. Each area consists of twenty generating units, con- nected using a tie line with capacity 1500MW. This test case is much complex and highly nonlinear, multimodal and discontinuous with many local minima as all practical complexities like VPL effects, RRL, and POZ are considered here. The fuel cost coefficient data is taken as in Ref. [39]
and are also listed in Table A3. The total power demand is considered as 10500MW. The area wise power demands are set at 7500MW and 3000MW respectively. The network topology is shown in Fig. 8.
Here the best cost solution obtained by SSA is 124647.0508 $/hr for tie line limit (TLLL) of 1500MW. Fig. 9 depicts the steady and stable cost convergence characteristic of SSA for the two area networks. The opti- mum power generation schedules are listed in Table 5, which shows the potential of SSA to satisfy associated operational constraints for larger and complex test case too and comparison of results in terms of cost with other methods are presented in Table 6.
Test case IV: It is a two area network with combined wind-thermal (WT) system having forty generating units [39]. The WT system is con- structed by replacing three thermal units of Test case III by the wind generators. These thermal units are 27, 28, and 29. The parameter used for wind generators are Weibull scale and shape factor as c1 = c2 = c3 =
15and k1 = k2 = k3 = 1.5.The penalty cost due to underestimation and
overestimation of stochastic wind power is considered as kp1 = kp2 = kp3 = 5, and kr1 = kr2 = kr3 = 5respectively. The cut-in speed(vin), cut out speed(v0), and rated wind speed (vr )are 5 m/s, 15 m/s, and 45 m/s similar to Ref. [51]. The rated wind power of three generators are considered as Pwr1 = Pwr2 = Pwr3 = 110MW . For the TLL capacity of 1500MW, the best total cost solution obtained by SSA is 120857.2447
$/hr, out of which the thermal cost is 120164.95424 $/hr and the wind over estimation cost 692.2903 $/hr. The Stochastic variation of wind velocity and corresponding wind power of three wind generators is plotted in Fig. 10. The optimum generation scheduling of generators is presented in Table 7 and the stable and steady cost convergence

4.1. Effect of control parameter

SSA is a population-based algorithm. Apart from population size, termination criteria and other common parameters it has only one con- trol parameter C1. To get optimum value, simulation analysis has been carried out with different population (search agent) sizes keeping maximum number of iterations 500 as the stopping criteria. Performance of SSA over 30 repeated trials is analyzed on Test Case I and the outcome of results are presented in Fig. 12 and Fig. 13, respectively. Here it is observed that with population size of 200, SSA attained minimum cost with less standard deviation. However, with further increase in popula- tion size there is no improvement in operational cost but average CPU time increases. Therefore, population size of 200 is considered for simulation analysis of MAED problems.
Now to find the optimal value of control parameter C1which is coupled with current iteration and maximum iteration by exponential term as defined in (22) and plotted in Fig. 14. Here it is observed that the value of C1exponentially decreases as iteration progresses, which shows the exploration in the initial stage and then exploitation in the later stage.

optimum cost obtained by SSA 7337.0139 $/hr is found to be compa- rable with MFO [43], HLSO [41] and better than IHS [38], IFEP [38] and IDEPSO4 [41], reported in the recent literature.
For large dimension problem (Test Case II), the optimal generation schedule and statistical results in terms of costs are summarized in Ta- bles 3 and 4 respectively. By comparison of costs reported by other metaheuristics it is observed that SSA can acquire lowest cost 122471.666 $/hr as compared to real coded genetic algorithms (RCGA) [40], differential evolution (DE) [40], evolutionary programming (EP) [40], artificial bee colony optimization (ABCO) [40], cuckoo search al- gorithm (CSA) [45] and flower pollination algorithm (FPA) [42]. Also the mean cost 122507.5003 $/hr obtained by SSA is found to be superior as compared to the best cost reported by other methods, which supports to claims the global search capability of SSA.
For two area network (Test case III) which has non-convex as well as discontinuous fuel cost characteristics due to VPL effect and POZ both are considered here. The minimum cost solution obtained by SSA is
124647.0508 $/hr and corresponding generation schedule is listed in Table 5. While comparing its statistical results in terms of cost with other methods in Table 6, such as stochastic fractal search (SFS) [47], hybrid DEPSO with different mutation strategy of DE, DEPSO1 to DSPSO4 [41], Hybrid sum local search optimizer (HLSO) [41] and MFO [43] and DEC2 [39], it is observed that the minimum cost obtained by SSA is better.
Test case IV is a modified version of Test case III, and modification has been done by replacing three thermal generators by the wind generators. It has highest complexity among all cases considered for simulation analysis. It includes complexity like probabilistic constraints due to wind integration in addition to VPL, RRL and POZ of the thermal system, makes the objective function multimodal as well as discontinuous in nature and hence finding global minima solution for such a complex constrained problem has become quite difficult task. For such a complex and highly constrained test case also SSA is able to obtain optimum generation cost of 120857.2447 $/hr which is found to be lower by 3789.8061 $/hr as compared to Test Cast III. Its detail solution which is listed in Table 7, shows the better constrained handling capability of SSA.
Therefore, we can say SSA has a strong ability to find a better quality of the solution.
But for two test cases, it is observed that minimum cost of SSA is found to be inferior as compared to hybrid version meta-heuristics re- ported in the literature listed in Tables 2 and 4, respectively. They are (i) for test case I, the best cost reported using a hybrid harmony search




Fig. 14. Variation of the Control parameter C1with iteration (Test Case I).


(HHS) [37] is 7329.85$/hr, while SSA has 7337.0139 $/hr. (ii) for test case II the best cost obtained using JAYA-TLBO [46] is 121694.4 $/hr while using SSA it is 122471.666 $/hr.

Computational efficiency
The best cost solution achieved by SSA and corresponding generation schedule for different cases are presented in Tables 1, 3, 5 and 7 show the ability to satisfy constraints for complex constrained optimization prob- lems. The average CPU time required to converge into the optimum so- lution for all four test cases are shown in Fig. 15. Considering dimensions and complexity levels of problems taken under consideration, such computational times are quite justified. Therefore, it can be said that SSA is computationally efficient also.

Robustness
The statistical results in terms of cost simulated over 30 independent runs of all four test cases having different dimensions/complexity are summarized in Table 2, Table 4, Table 6, and Table 8. The robustness of the algorithm is analyzed on the basis of mean cost and standard devi- ation (SD). For test case I, the mean cost of SSA is found to be inferior to hybrid/improved version of metaheuristics reported in literature as hybrid sum-local search optimizer (HLSO) [41], DEPSO4 [41] but su- perior to MFO [43]. Here the SD of cost for SSA is also higher as compared to others.
For large dimension test case II, even the worst cost solution of SSA 122737.9965 $/hr is found to be superior to the best cost reported by EP [40], DE [40], ABCO [40], FPA [42] and CSA [45] listed in Table 4.
For two area system test case III, with the nonlinear, multimodal and discontinuous objective function, the mean cost 124688.4065 $/hr of SSA is better as compared to other bio-inspired methods as variants of DE

[41], MFO [43], SFS [47] and ISFS [47] listed in Table 6. Here also it is observed that SD of cost 88.1322 for SSA is either superior or almost comparable to other reported methods except DEC2 [39].
Comparing the results of Test case III and Test case IV, i.e. MAED problem of thermal system and then MAED problem of wind-thermal system as presented in Tables 6 and 8, it has been observed that cost is reduced significantly by wind integration but due to additional proba- bilistic constraints, standard deviation of the cost is found to be large. Based on this discussion, we can say SSA is a robust optimization approach.

Conclusion

In this paper, a salp swarm algorithm is implemented to solve MAED problems with different dimensions and operational complexity. By analyzing the generation schedule, it has been observed that all opera- tional constraints are fully satisfied for all the test cases having different dimensions and complexity level. It proves that SSA can efficiently handle the constraints. Through comparison of best cost solution with other metaheuristics, SSA is found to be effective in terms of solution quality too. The average CPU time required to converge into the optimum solution has also been analyzed, considering the dimension and complexity of problems. SSA is found to be sufficiently fast converging algorithm. Despite providing good results, it has been observed that SSA suffers from premature convergence especially for test cases having objective function non-convex, discontinuous and probabilistic in nature. It may be due to parameter C1, which decreases exponentially and is responsible for exploration and exploitation during the optimization process. Therefore a more extensive research on the sensitivity analysis of parameter C1can further improve SSA.
