Abstract
This paper presents a novel Gaussian mixture approximation smoother (GMA) for estimation the nonlinear system state. The smoothing implementation is transformed into computing some Gaussian weighted integrals, which triggers the development of the new GMA-URTSS algorithm by applying unscented transformation (UT). Simulation application demonstrates the superior performance of the proposed method.

Introduction

Nonlinear state smoothing estimation has been attracting considerable research interests (see, e,g., [1]-[3] and the references therein) because of its widespread applications in signal processing, navigation and communication. The smoothing problem involves computing the probability density function (PDF) of a sto-
chastic dynamic state xk conditioned on a sequence of noisy measurements zN  {z1 ,z2 , ,zk , zN } . The gen-
eral optimal fixed-interval smoothing scheme in conjunction with the Bayesian rule [4], is given by the func-
tional recursive relations for computation of the PDFs p(xk |zN ) from p(xk +1|zN ) for all k  {0 1,  ,N} . For
the nonlinear system, the exact description of such posterior smoothing PDFs by way of the Bayesian recur- sive equations is unavailable and intractable since the Bayesian solution requires the propagation of full prob- ability density which results in the computation intensive in numerical implementation [5].

are thus necessary, and the Gaussian approximation (GA) to such PDFs is widely accepted by the fact that the correspondingly derived GA smoother is always cost-effective with acceptable accuracy desirable in practical applications. So far, a large number of GA smoother have been proposed for smoothing the nonlinear state from a reentry tracking problem [1]-[2], including the extended Kalman smoother (EKS) based on the first- order linearization, the unscented Rauch–Tung–Striebel smoother (URTSS) based on the unscented transfor- mation (UT) , the quadrature Kalman smoother (QKS) based on the quadrature rule, the central difference Kalman smoother (CDKS) based on the polynomial interpolation and the cubature Klaman smoother (CKS) based on the cubature rule.
In general, the above-mentioned GA smoothers approximate the state PDF using a single Gaussian, such that they are only suitable for the case that the state PDF is the gaussianity or unimodality, and that the system model is at most weakly nonlinear. However, a state which is initially Gaussian will inevitably become sig- nificantly non-Gaussian if propagated over a sufficiently long time span. In this situation, although the single GA smoother is better than the corresponding GA filter, it still inevitably results in inaccurate state estimate. Consequently, a Gaussian mixture approximation (GMA) to the smoothing PDF is more appropriate than the GA as a result that: 1) it can effectively approximate any PDF as closely as desired (in the L1 norm) [6] by using a weighted sum of Gaussian densities, and 2) it enables a more accurate representation of the nonlineari- ties in the dynamics and measurement models. Therefore, there is a great demand to develop the correspond- ing GMA smoother for nonlinear system in a reentry tracking problem. Up to the present, an explicit and sys- tematic solution to the derivation of the GMA smoother has been seldom reported.
Here, motivated by the fact that the GMA is more accurate than the GA, we present the GMA smoother for the ballistic reentry tracking problem. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II formulates the investigated problem and recalls the standard GA filter and smoother. Section III derives the GMA smoother on the basis of the standard GA estimators. Section IV gives the simulation application for the reentry track- ing problem. Some conclusions are drawn in section V.

Problem Formulation and Standard GA Estimator

We consider the following discrete-time nonlinear stochastic system for generally describing the problem of tracking a ballistic target on reentry

distribution with mean xˆ0|0 and covariance P0|0 , which is independent of wk and vk .
Our aim is to design the GMA smoother for the system in (1)-(2). In other words, we need to find the Gaus-

sian mixture approximation to the smoothing PDFs pGMA ( xk | ZN ) for all k
 {0,
1,2,  , N} , where

N

. Then, the smoothing estimation and the associated covariance in the GMA form can be ob-

tained by computing the first two moments of pGMA ( xk | YN ) .
In [6], Ito and Xiong presented a general GA filter, whose implementation can be separated into two steps
including the state prediction and correction. Afterwards, [2] and [3] provided the GA smoother, which is implemented as follows.

In general, the GA smoother in (3) is a forward-backward smoother [3]. As seen from Fig. 1, in the forward pass, the GA smoother uses the GA filter to compute the filtering density up to p( xN | ZN ) . In the backward pass, it implements (3) for rolling backwards from pGA(xN 1 | ZN ) to pGA (x0 | ZN ) . Through initialization
of pGA ( xN | YN )  N( xN ; xˆN |N , PN |N ) , the GA smoother recursively operates by joint the analytical compu-
tation in (3) and the Gaussian weighted integrals in (4).

Fig. 1 The forward and backward passes in the GA smoother
The heart of implementing the GA smoother is how to compute the nonlinear Gaussian weighted integrals in (4). However, for the nonlinearity of fk ( ) and hk ( ) , the GA smoother is only formal in the sense that it rarely can be directly used in practice since the model nonlinearity causes the intractability and infeasibility of analytically computing such integrals. For this reason, some numerical methods are required for approximat- ing such integrals, e.g., the linearization and the corresponding GA smoother is the existing GA-EKS in [2]. At the same time, as a result of the better precision of unscented transformation (UT) than the linearization, we can also develop the existing GA-URTSS in [2] by using UT for computing such integrals.

Problem Formulation and Standard GA Estimator

For the derivation of GMA smoother, a standard result about Gaussian functions in [7] is recalled.
Lemma 1. Given F , d , Q , m and P of appropriate dimensions, and that Q and P are positive definition, it can be obtained that
N( x, F	+ d ,Q)N(, m, P)d = N( x, Fm + d ,Q + FPF T ) .	(5)
Firstly, we have to find the GMA filter.
Step 1: The GMA filter. According to [6], given the Gaussian sum approximation

the GMA filtering PDF can be obtained as follows

i 1	i 1

where each filter is independent of the others and can be performed in a parallel manner, and the weights i


are updated and normalized by learning from Eqs. (5.1)-(5.2) in [6]

i N(z

Hence, the GMA filtering estimate and the corresponding covariance are obtained by computing the first two moments of the PDF in (7)
Step 2: The GMA smoother. The PDF pGMA ( xk | xk 1 , zk ) can be expressed by the GMA method, i.e.

p	( x | x

where xˆi

are given in (10), and the weights	i are updated and normalized by learning from

Eqs. (5.1)-(5.2) in [6]

Then through using Lemma 1, the smoothed PDF pGMA ( xk | YN ) at k can be updated from (9) and (12)

Hence, the GMA smoothing estimate and the corresponding covariance are obtained by computing the first two moments of the PDF in (13)
Note that as shown in (3), the GA smoother starts from the initial density pGA ( xN | YN ) . Similarly, the GA smoother is the foundation of developing the GMA smoother, hence, according to (7), the GMA smoother is initialized as follows, i.e.

In addition, the number of the GA terms in (13) grows exponentially, due to the fact that the posterior PDFs
in (9) and (12) have a Gaussian mixture form. Therefore, in order to decrease the computational complexity, it is necessary to reduce the number of the GA terms. One simplest way of mixture reduction is to retain only a
few Gaussians with highest weights, where, if { j  j 1,  , L} are the L highest weights all of {s
s 1,  , ML} , the GMA smoother in (13) becomes

where x1 and x2 are altitude and velocity, respectively; x3 is a constant ballistic coefficient that depends on the target’s mass, shape, cross-sectional area and air density; g is gravity ( g=9.81m/s2 ) and the constant =5  10 4 .
For the model problem at hand, a radar is located at (0, H) and equipped to measure the range z at a sam- pling time interval of T. Hence, the measurement equation is given by

Here, we select the accumulative root mean square error (ARMSE) for comparing the GA and GMA
smoothing performance. For the GMA in (7) and (15), the number of the GA terms is M  L  50 .  in UT is
chosen as 0. Each trajectory was simulated for 100s and a total of N =1000 .The experimental data is that

In estimation accuracy, the proposed GMA-URTSS and GMA-EKS algorithms outperform the existing GA-URTSS and GA-EKS in [2], respectively. Moreover, expect for some time steps, the ARMSE of the GMA-URTSS is less than that of the GMA-EKS since the UT technique is superior to the first-order lineariza- tion in approximating the posterior mean and covariance of the nonlinear state. Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 make us be- lieve that the GMA smoother performs significantly better than the corresponding GA smoother in estimation precision.

Conclusion

Motivated by the fact that the GMA is more accurate than the GA, based on the existing standard GA filter and smoother, we propose a general GMA smoother for estimating the nonlinear state from racking a ballistic target on reentry. Furthermore, the new GMA-URTSS algorithm is developed by using UT for numerically computing the Gaussian weighted integrals in GMA smoother. The simulations show that the proposed GMA- URTSS outperforms the corresponding GA-URSS by its superior estimation accuracy.
