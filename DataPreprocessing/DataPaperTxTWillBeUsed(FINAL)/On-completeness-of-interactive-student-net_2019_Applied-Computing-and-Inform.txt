The completeness of interactive student networks are investigated in this paper, which can be used to improve middle school students’ independent environment for their study outside class. This paper takes covering approximation spaces as mathematical models of interactive student networks and character- izes completeness of interactive student networks by connectivity of covering approximation spaces. Further, this paper gives a simpler and practical method to check completeness of interactive student net- works. Consequently, a way to communication among students is explored and applied in education.

Introduction

In the world, middle school students’ knowledge acceptance may be divided into three stages: preview before class, classroom learning and review after class. We observe the three stages, the problems arise more frequently in preview stage or review stage than in class learning. The most part of the problems can be solved in classes, but if they are solved outside class in previewing or reviewing, the effectiveness will be more beneficial. However, due to students’ independent environments outside classes, it is difficult for students to solve these problems by themselves. In the past years, some more recent researches on using ‘‘social meth- ods” in education has aroused more and more scholar’s wide inter- ests and many interesting results were obtained [1,5,14,19]. Having gained some enlightenments from these researches, we carry out the research for the following issue supported by a major project of Chinese postdoctoral scientific foundation.

As an interesting exploration on the above issue, Z. Xia, the first author of this paper, designed a interactive student network for a group of twelve students in Suzhou No.3 High School (see the fol- lowing 1.4). Students, who use the interactive student network, can send and receive information each other. This network created a new environment for these students and would promote the interaction among these students. We state the concept of interac- tive student network as follows, which is similar to wireless net- work system in [9].

The interactive student network (V ; S)

A interactive student network is a pair (V ; S) satisfying the fol- lowing conditions, where V is a collection of some information points and S is a collection of some base stations.

Every information point in V can send information to some base stations in S and receive information from these base stations in S.
Every base station in S can send information to some infor- mation points in V and receive information from these infor- mation points in V.

Completeness of interactive student networks

Let (V ; S) be a interactive student network.

An information point u in V and an base stations B in S is

called to have a contact if u and B can send and receive infor- mation each other.
Two information point u and v in V is called to have a contact
if there are some information points u1; u2; ... ; un in V and

some base stations B1; B2; ... ; Bn—1 ∈S such that for each i = 1; 2; ... ; n — 1, not only ui and Bi have a contact but also ui+1 and Bi have a contact, where u1 = u and un = v.
(V ; S) is called complete if u and v have a contact for all pair
u; v of information points in V.

Thus, any pair of students can send and receive information each other by using a complete interactive student network. In fact, let two students P1 and P2 use information points u and v in
V respectively, where (V ; S) is a complete interactive student net-
work. Then there are some information points u1; u2; ... ; un ∈ U and some base stations B1; B2; ... ; Bn—1 ∈S such that for each i = 1; 2; ... ; n — 1, not only ui and Bi have a contact but also ui+1 and Bi have a contact, where u1 = u and un = v. Since u1 and B1 have a contact, with the help of u = u1; P1 can send information
to B1. Also, since u2 and B1 have a contact, B1 can send information to u2. Thus, P1 can send information to u2. Successively, P1 can send information to un = v. Moreover, with the help of v = un; P2 can
receive information sent by P1.

Xia’s interactive student network

Now we state Xia’s interactive student network (V ; S), which is described in the following table (Table 1).
Here, V = {u1; u2; u3; u4; u5; u6; u7; u8; u9; u10; u11; u12} is the col- lection of twelve information points, S = {B1; B2; B3; B4; B5; B6} is the collection of six base stations, and the number, which lies in the cross of the row labeled by u (u = u1; u2; u3; u4; u5; u6; u7; u8; u9; u10; u11; u12) and the column labeled by B (B = B1; B2; B3; B4; B5; B6), is 1 or 0 by u and B can send and receive information each other or can not.
By the method of enumeration, it is not difficult to check that Xia’s interactive student network (V ; S) is complete. Thus, any pair of students in Suzhou No.3 High School, who use information points in (V ; S), can send and receive information each other. As a further work, Xia tried to establish interactive student networks in a larger scale. However, it is necessary to design more informa- tion points and base stations in such an interactive student net- works, which make it complicated and difficult to check the completeness of interactive student networks by the method of enumeration. This brings the following question.

The open question

For a interactive student network, how to check its complete- ness? More precisely, are there a simpler and practical method to check completeness of interactive student networks?.
To investigate the above question, it is necessary to analyze data collected from interactive student networks. In the research of modern sciences, in order to extract useful information hidden in data, many methods in addition to classical logic and classical mathematics have been proposed. Rough set theory, which was proposed by Pawlak [15], plays an important role in applications of these methods. Their usefulness has been demonstrated by many successful applications in information sciences and com- puter sciences [2,4,12,18,21,22]. In particular, rough set theory is
also applied in education widely [3,7,17,20]. In the past years, with development of information sciences and computer sciences, applications of rough-set theory have been extended from Pawlak approximation spaces to covering approximation spaces in many research fields [10,11,13,16,23,24].

The purpose of this paper

This paper launches an investigation around Question 1.5 by covering approximation spaces. The purpose of this paper is to give a simpler and practical method for checking completeness of inter- active student networks.

Covering approximation spaces

In this section, we state basic concepts and theories of covering approximation spaces.

Definition 2.1 24. Let U, the universe of discourse, be a finite set and K be a family of nonempty subsets of U.
K is called a cover of U if S{K : K ∈ K} = U.
The pair (U; K) is called a covering approximation space if K
is a cover of U.


Remark 2.2. Let (U; K) be a covering approximation space. If Ø∈K and K is closed with respect to both the union and the finite inter- section of elements of K, then (U; K) is a topological space [6].
Now we state connectivity of covering approximation spaces (see [8,9], for example) and give its discussion again.

Definition 2.3. Let (U; K) be a covering approximation space and
x; y ∈ U.

A subfamily {K1; K2; ... ; Kn} of K is called a chain between x
and  y  if  x ∈ K1; y ∈ Kn  and  Ki T Ki+1 – Ø  for  each
i = 1; 2; .. . ; n — 1.
x is called to be chain connected to y if there is a chain between x and y.

Remark 2.4. Let (U; K) be a covering approximation space. Then the relation for ‘‘chain connected” is an equivalent relation, i.e., the following hold for all x; y; z ∈ U.

x is chain connected to x.
x is chain connected to y ⇒ y is chain connected to x.
x is chain connected to y and y is chain connected to z ⇒ x is chain connected to z.

Proof. Obviously, (1) and (2) hold. Let x be chain connected to y, and y be chain connected to z. Then there are K1; K2; ... ; Kn ∈K 
such that x ∈ K1; y ∈ Kn; Ki T Ki+1 – Ø for each i = 1; 2; ... ; n — 1;
and   there   are   Kn+1; Kn+2; ... ; Kn+m ∈K   such   that
y ∈ Kn+1; z ∈ Kn+m; Kn+i T Kn+i+1 – Ø  for  each  i = 1; 2; .. . ; m — 1.


Table 1
Xia’s Interactive Student Network (V ; S).


Consequently, there are K1; K2; ... ; Kn; Kn+1; Kn+2; ... ; Kn+m ∈K such that   x ∈ K1; z ∈ Kn+m   and   Ki T Ki+1 – Ø   for   each
i = 1; 2; ... ; n + m — 1. This proves that x is chain connected to z. So (3) holds. h

Definition 2.5. A covering approximation space (U; K) is called connected if for each pair x; y ∈ U; x is chain connected to y, i.e., there is a chain between x and y.
As a classical result in topology, a topological space (X; У) is connected if and only if (X; У) has no non-empty clopen proper subset. Note that there is not concept for clopen subset for covering approximation spaces. So we need to introduced a class of new subsets of covering approximation spaces, which has relation with the following covering upper approximation operator.

Definition 2.6. Let (U; K) be a covering approximation space. For each X C U, Put
SH(X)= [{K : K ∈K and K \ X – Ø}.

Then SH : 2U —→2U is called a covering upper approximation opera- tor, and SH(X) is called a covering upper approximation of X.
The above covering upper approximation operator SH is called the second type of covering upper approximation operation in [24].

Definition 2.7. Let (U; K) be a covering approximation space and
X C U. X is called an SH-subset of (U; K) if SH(X)= X.
The following theorem is an important result of this paper, which characterizes connectivity of covering approximation spaces by their SH-subsets.

Lemma 2.8. Let (U; K) be a covering approximation space and x ∈ U. Put X = {u ∈ U : x is chain connected to u}. If X = U, then (U; K) is connected.

Proof. Assume that X = U. Let u; v ∈ U = X. Then x is chain con- nected to both u and v. By Remark 2.4(2), (3), u is chain connected to v. So (U; K) is connected. h

Theorem 2.9. Let (U; K) be a covering approximation space. Then the following are equivalent.

(U; K) is connected.
(U; K) has no non-empty proper SH-subset.

Proof.

⇒ (2). Suppose that (U; K) is connected. Let X be a non-
is chain connected to y by Remark 2.4(3). It follows that y ∈ X. This proves that SH(X) C X. On the other hand, It is clear that X C SH(X), and hence SH(X)= X. Thus, X is a SH- subset of (U; K), it follows that X = U. By Lemma 2.8, (U; K)
is connected. h

The method of checking completeness of interactive student networks

In this section, we establish a relation between completeness of interactive student networks and connectivity of covering approx- imation spaces. By this relation we give a method to check com- pleteness of interactive student networks.

Proposition 3.1. Let (V ; S) be a interactive student network. For every base station B in S, let KB be a set of some information points in V such that u ∈ V is an information point in KB if and only if u and B have a contact. Put U = V and K= {KB : B ∈ S}. Then (U; K) is a covering approximation space.

Proof. It suffices to prove that K is a cover of U. Let u ∈ U, i.e., u is an information point in V. By 1.2(1), there is a base station B in S such that u and B have a contact. So u is an information point in KB, i.e., u ∈ KB. This proves that K is a cover of U. h
By the above proposition, we can take covering approximation spaces as mathematical models of interactive student networks. Here, the covering approximation space (U; K) is called to be induced by the interactive student network (V ; S).

Lemma 3.2. Let (V ; S) be a interactive student network, and let (U; K) be a covering approximation space induced by (V ; S). Then the following are equivalent for all u; v ∈ V = U.

u and v have a contact in (V ; S).
There is a chain between u and v in (U; K).

Proof.

⇒ (2): Let u and v have a contact. Then there are some infor- mation points u1; u2; .. . ; un ∈ U and some base stations B1; B2; .. . ; Bn—1 ∈S such that for each i = 1; 2; ... ; n — 1, not
only ui and Bi have a contact but also ui+1 and Bi have a con- tact, where u1 = u and un = v. Note that (U; K) is induced by (V ; S). For each i = 1; 2; ... ; n — 1; KBi ∈ K, we put Ki = KBi .
Then K1; K2; ... ; Kn—1 ∈ K, and for each i = 1; 2; ... ; n — 1;
ui; ui+1 ∈ Ki. It follows that u = u1 ∈ K1; v = un ∈ Kn—1, and for each i = 1; 2; ... ; n — 2, ui+1 ∈ Ki T Ki+1 – Ø. This shows
that K1; K2; ... ; Kn—1 is a chain between u and v.
⇒ (1): Let K1; K2; ... ; Kn is a chain between u and v, i.e.,

empty SH-subset of (U; K). Then SH(X) = X – Ø. We only
need to prove that X is not a proper subset of U, i.e. X = U.
u ∈ K1; v ∈ Kn
and Ki T K

i+1
– Ø for each i = 1; 2; .. . ; n — 1.

Let x ∈ U. Pick y ∈ X, then y is chain connected to x, i.e., there are	K1; K2; ... ; Kn ∈K	such	that	y ∈ K1; x ∈ Kn	and
Put u1 = u, un+1 = v, and for each i = 1; 2; .. . ; n — 1, choose
ui+1 ∈ Ki T Ki+1.  It  follows  that  ui; ui+1 ∈ Ki  for  each

Ki T Ki+1 – Ø for each i = 1; 2; ... ; n — 1. Since y ∈ K1 T X –
Ø; K1 C SH(X) = X. Furthermore, K2 T X э K2 T K1 – Ø,  so
K2 C SH(X) = X. In the same way, we can obtain that Kn C SH(X) = X. Thus, x ∈ Kn C X. This proves that U C X. It follows that X = U.
⇒ (1). Suppose that (U; K) has no non-empty proper SH- subset. Let x ∈ U. Put X = {u ∈ U : x is chain connected to u}.
Then x ∈ X – Ø by Remark 2.4(1). Let y ∈ SH(X). Then there is K ∈K such that y ∈ K and K TX – Ø. Pick z ∈ K TX. Then x
is chain connected to z, and z is chain connected to y. So x
i = 1; 2; ... ; n. Since (U; K) is induced by (V ; S), there are base
stations B1; B2; ... ; Bn ∈S such that Ki = KBi  for each i = 1; 2; ... ; n. Thus, for each i = 1; 2; ... ; n, ui; ui+1 ∈ KBi , i.e., not only ui and Bi have a contact but also ui+1 and Bi have a contact. This proves that u and v have a contact. h

By Lemma 3.2, we obtain the following theorem immediately, which shows that the completeness of interactive student net- works and the connectivity of covering approximation spaces are equivalent.

Theorem 3.3. Let (V ; S) be a interactive student network, and let (U; K) be a covering approximation space induced by (V ; S). Then the following are equivalent.

(V ; S) is complete.
(U; K) is connected.

Now we give a simpler and practical method for checking com- pleteness of interactive student networks.

Method 3.4. Let (V ; S) be a interactive student network. The method for checking completeness of (V ; S) consists of the following five steps.

By Proposition 3.1, we convert (V ; S) to a covering approxi- mation space (U; K), where (U; K) is induced by (V ; S).
By Definition 2.6, we endow the covering upper approxima- tion operator SH on (U; K).
By Definition 2.7, we obtain all SH-subsets of (U; K) by a sim- ple algorithm.
By the above (3) and Theorem 2.9, it is known that whether
(U; K) is connected.
By the above (4) and Theorem 3.3, it is known that whether
(V ; S) is complete.

Some applications

In this section, we give some applications to show that our approach does work. This work is to assess completeness of inter- active student networks.

Check of Xia’s interactive student network

Description of Xia’s interactive student network (V ; S)
(see 1.4 in Section 1).
(1.1)  V = {u1; u2; u3; u4; u5; u6; u7; u8; u9; u10; u11; u12} is the col- lection of twelve information points.
(1.2) S = {B1; B2; B3; B4; B5; B6} is the collection of six base stations.
(1.3) Contacts between information points and base stations. (1.3.1)  B1 and ui have a contact for i ∈ {1; 5; 6; 7; 8; 11}.
(1.3.2)  B2 and ui have a contact for i ∈ {2; 3; 5; 8; 10; 12}.
(1.3.3)  B3 and ui have a contact for i ∈ {1; 2; 7; 9; 11; 12}.
(1.3.4)  B4 and ui have a contact for i ∈ {1; 3; 4; 9; 10; 12}.
(1.3.5)  B5 and ui have a contact for i ∈ {3; 4; 6; 7; 8; 9}.
(1.3.6)  B6 and ui have a contact for i ∈ {2; 4; 5; 6; 10; 11}.
The covering approximation space (U; K) induced by
(V ; S).
(2.1)  Put U = V .
(2.2) For each i ∈ {1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6}, let Ki be a set of some infor- mation points in V such that u ∈ V is an information point in Ki if and only if u and Bi have a contact.
(2.2.1)  K1 = {u1; u5; u6; u7; u8; u11}.
(2.2.2)  K2 = {u2; u3; u5; u8; u10; u12}.
(2.2.3)  K3 = {u1; u2; u7; u9; u11; u12}.
(2.2.4)  K4 = {u1; u3; u4; u9; u10; u12}.
(2.2.5)  K5 = {u3; u4; u6; u7; u8; u9}.
(2.2.6)  K6 = {u2; u4; u5; u6; u10; u11}.
(2.3)  Put K= {K1; K2; K3; K4; K5; K6}.
(2.4) It is clear that (U; K) is a covering approximation space induced by (V ; S).
The connectivity of (U; K).
By a simple algorithm, it can be obtained that if X is a non-empty SH-subset of (U; K), then X = U. In fact, let
X be an SH-subset of (U; K) and X – Ø. Then there is
ui ∈ X for some i ∈ {1; 2; ... ; 12}. If u1 ∈ X, then Ki T X – Ø for i = 1; 3; 4. Thus, X = SH(X)= S{K : K ∈ K and K T X – Ø} ≥ K1 S K3 S K4 =   {u1; u2; u3; u4; u5;
u6; u7; u8; u9; u10; u11; u12}= U. It follows that X = U. By
the same method, we can obtain that if ui ∈ X for i ∈ {2; 3; ... ; 12}, then X = U. This shows that (U; K) has no non-empty proper SH-subset. It follows that (U; K) is connected from Theorem 2.9.
The completeness of (V ; S).
By Theorem 3.3, (V ; S) is complete.

A simulative interactive student network

As a re-examine of our method, the following gives a simulative interactive student network.

Description of the simulative interactive student net- work (V ; S).
This network is described as follows.
(1.1)  V = {u1; u2; u3; u4; u5; u6; u7; u8; u9} is the collection of nine information points.
(1.2) S = {B1; B2; B3; B4; B5; B6} is the collection of six base stations.
(1.3) Contacts between information points and base stations. (1.3.1)  B1 and ui have a contact for i ∈ {1; 3; 8; 9}.
(1.3.2) B2 and ui have a contact for i ∈ {1; 4; 9}. (1.3.3) B3 and ui have a contact for i ∈ {3; 4; 8}. (1.3.4) B4 and ui have a contact for i ∈ {2; 6; 7}. (1.3.5) B5 and ui have a contact for i ∈ {2; 5; 7}. (1.3.6)  B6 and ui have a contact for i ∈ {5; 6; 7}.

Similar to Xia’s interactive student network, we can describe the simulative interactive student network by the following table (Table 2).

The covering approximation space (U; K) induced by
(V ; S).
(2.1)  Put U = V .
(2.2)  For each i ∈ {1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6}, let Ki be a set of some infor- mation points in V such that u ∈ V is an information point in Ki if and only if u and Bi have a contact.
(2.2.1)  K1 = {u1; u3; u8; u9}.




Table 2
A simulative interactive student network (V ; S).


(2.2.2)	K2 = {u1; u4; u9}.
(2.2.3)	K3 = {u3; u4; u8}.
(2.2.4)	K4 = {u2; u6; u7}.
(2.2.5)	K5 = {u2; u5; u7}.
(2.2.6)	K6 = {u5; u6; u7}.
(2.3)	Put K= {K1; K2; K3; K4; K5; K6}.
(2.4)	It is clear that (U; K) is a covering approximation space induced by (V ; S).
SH-subsets of the covering approximation space (U; K).

By a simple algorithm, we obtain all SH-subsets of (U; K). They are Ø; U; {1; 3; 4; 8; 9} and {2; 5; 6; 7}.

The connectivity of (U; K).
By the above (3), (U; K) has two non-empty proper SH- subset. So (U; K) is not connected from Theorem 2.9.
The completeness of (V ; S).
By Theorem 3.3, (V ; S) is not complete.


Remark 4.1. In Xia’s interactive student network and the simula- tive interactive student network, fewer information points and base stations are designed. However, if we establish interactive student network in large-scale, then voluminous information points and base stations should be designed in general. It is note- worthy that the method for checking their completeness is the same, which can be achieved by some simple algorithms under the help of computer technology.

Conclusion

Conclusion 5.1. The main results of this paper are to investigate completeness of interactive student networks. Here, interactive student networks are used to transform middle school students’ independent environment in preview and review such that students can contact each other by using the complete interactive student networks. In order to investigate completeness of interac- tive student networks by mathematical methods, this paper takes covering approximation spaces as mathematical models of inter- active student networks and establish a relation between com- pleteness of interactive student networks and connectivity of covering approximation spaces. Further, this paper introduces SH- subsets of covering approximation spaces to characterize their connectivity. By converting completeness of interactive student network to connectivity of covering approximation spaces, this paper gives a simpler and practical method for checking com- pleteness of interactive student network. In the end of this paper, two examples are given to demonstrate applications of this method.
Remark 5.2. This paper focuses on check of completeness of inter- active student networks, without dealing with the method of establishing them. How do we establish a complete interactive stu- dent network? This is an interesting question, which deals with either mobile communication project or virtual organization framework. We will discuss this question in our future work.
