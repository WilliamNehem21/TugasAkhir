based on the spatial correlation algorithm, such as distributed Bayesian fault tolerant detection algorithm (BFTD) [2].
However, BFTD frequent communication between adjacent nodes, that leads the energy consume fast .A- SMAC protocol based on data traffic dynamic adjustment to listen and sleep time. A-SMAC protocol does not contribute to the reliability of the underlying data judgment. Usually send out unreliable information, result in wrong decision to Fusion Center.
In this paper, we present an adaptive fault tolerant algorithm (AFTA).Through the Threshold Area Decision Scheme [3], using the data correlation, realize the combination of underlying data fault-tolerant verdict and A-SMAC protocol.
We adopt the simulation shown the values of slow changes in the monitor environments, the AFTA could improve the efficiency of valid data delivery and reduce the unnecessary data to send.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents Time Correlation Fault-tolerant algorithm. Adaptive listening dormancy discussed in Section 3. Section 4 described our simulation results. Section 5 concludes the paper.

Fault-tolerant Based on Time Correlation

System model

When a sensor readings is greater than certain threshold, assumes the sensor monitoring area by events; And when the sensor readings is smaller than certain threshold, it assumes no incident. Because of the sensor is not reliability, sensor readings may greater than a certain threshold method does not necessarily mean the monitoring area has occurred.
We define the node  in t time values is :
Ȥ𝚒(t) = m𝚒(t) + ǽ𝚒	(2-1)
is environment characteristic value at t time.ǽ	is Detection of noise(including the effect on the stability of the environment noise and equipment).
Assume that at any time of t,ǽ𝚒(t)is Gaussian distribution ȃ(O,ı2)˚We define that t is the system test cycle,this the threshold. Each node periodically send binary decision, get test results:S𝚒(KTs)

S𝚒(KTs) = { 1	if χ𝚒(KTs) ≥ th

S𝚒(KTs) = O is at(KTs )time test results of the node i is “no event”.

(2-2)

So we know S𝚒 KTs = 1 actually as result is “ev(ent”). Assume that node i at KTs time the actual

circumstances of the environment in a binary variable T𝚒 KTs T𝚒(KTs) = { 1,	if m𝚒(KTs) ≥ th
to expression:



(2-3)

T𝚒(KTs)=0 is at time of KTs situation for the environment without incident.T𝚒(KTs)=1 is real situation for



It has four possible situations:  (  )  , (  )   (Sensor correctly report without events); 𝚒( s) , 𝚒( s)  (Sensor correctly report events); 𝚒( s) , 𝚒( s)  (Sensor error report events);	,	(sensor error report without events).
We observe that sensor node have not reliability, T𝚒(KTs) 𝗀S𝚒(KTs) may occur, also is to detect errors.

P1 = P(S𝚒(KTs) = O|T𝚒(KTs) = 1) = P(χ𝚒(KTs) < 𝑡ℎ| m𝚒(KTs) ≥ th) = Q (mi(KTs)−th)	(2-4)

P2 = P(S𝚒(KTs) = 1|T𝚒(KTs) = O) = P(χ𝚒(KTs) ≥ th| m𝚒(KTs) < 𝑡ℎ) = Q (th−mi(KTs))	(2-5)

We define the time correlation of fault tolerance algorithm, is used to improve the energy efficiency and precision.

Time correlation data

Under the condition of monitoring the environment change slowly, environment characteristic value in a short period of time considered change slowly.
So we called value at the time of the redundant as time correlation data [5]. We define that node i characteristic value keeps the same situation at	.
So in time t, (L + 1) consecutive redundant information can be used to test results of time error correction.
Average values of node i within the time period C is:
̅X𝚒;C =  1  ∑L𝚒=0 x𝚒 [(k− l)Ts] =  1  ∑L𝚒=0 m𝚒[(k− l)Ts] +  1  ∑L𝚒=0 z𝚒 [(k− l)Ts] = m̅ 𝚒 + Z̅𝚒	(2-6)

binary decision threshold is 0.5(m𝚗+m𝗍).

For the actual situation of node  environment to make the following binary estimates 𝚒	s
R𝚒(KTs) = { O	if	X̅𝚒′(k−L)Ts,kTs < th

Detection error probability can be approximately expressed in the following Q function to:

p^ = P(R𝚒(KTs) = O|T𝚒(KTs) = 1)=P(R𝚒(KTs) = 1|T𝚒(KTs) = O) = Q [(m𝗍−m𝚗)√L+1]	(2-8)

The system miss probabilityPMand false alarm probability PF are given by
PM = P(R𝚒(KTs) = O|T𝚒(KTs) = 1);PF = P(R𝚒(KTs) = 1|T𝚒(KTs) = O).


If	and	that means corrected a mistake. Type (2-8) is shown that probability of miss and probability of false alarm decreases with the increase of L.

Threshold Area Ruling Model

Using environment characteristic value if there has been a marked change, the node redundancy testing information of fault tolerance, will introduce more mistakes. So we define the node decision threshold area concept (such as those described in [7]).Through the threshold region to estimate changed in the environment. Here we suppose the threshold area:	𝗍	Įı	𝚗	Įı , The parameter is the standard variance of
According to the same node in time of the adjacent value differences, defines the dynamic change of environment. If the same node twice values satisfy the following condition, define that obvious changes have taken place in monitor region.

{χ𝚒((k− 1)Ts) < m𝗍 − 𝘢σ and χ𝚒(kTs) > m𝚗 + 𝘢σ}
{χ𝚒((k− 1)Ts) > m𝚗 + 𝘢σ and χ𝚒(kTs) < m𝗍 − 𝘢σ}	(2-9)

Otherwise, we assume the value of the testing region is not changing significantly.
If the node i characteristic values for environment is	𝚗then the probability density function of 𝚒	s is :
f0(χ𝚒(kTs)) =  1   exp [− (×i(kTs)−m𝚗)2]	(2-10)

Similarly, if the environmental characteristic value of node i is m𝗍,Probability of χ𝚒(kTs) as follows:

Expanding the single threshold for the threshold area, (2-9) formula to judge whether tested environment changed. In order to estimate the duration time of the node and adjust the average values (2-6), and finally


make an estimate of the actual situation of the environment. The algorithm implementation step in the following ways:
Using the detection threshold area, to determine whether a test environment change obviously.
In case of obvious change, the binary decision, binary estimates	and will be the verdict sent three times in a row.
If it had no obvious change, determine the time correlation processing period T, to calculate the L

For binary decision detection average values . For binary estimate T, and then send the verdict.
If this test environment does not change, using the data of time correlation, fault-tolerant processing of test data. If suddenly change, a binary decision sent three times in a row, is to improve the node number of sent packets.
In MAC layer, A-SMAC protocol according to the node throughput dynamic adjustment to listen and sleep time. So it can transmit the information in a timely manner.

Adaptive Listening Dormancy Scheme

A-SMAC protocol principle

A-SMAC protocol is based on the SMAC protocol improved, such as propose in [8,9]. A-SMAC protocol has adaptive listening scheme could according to the value of the node throughput to predict the change of network traffic.

A-SMAC protocol working process

A-SMAC protocol could base on the node throughput to measure the size of network traffic. Set the parameters used for statistical nodes in each cycle to send and receive packets number. We adopt the two threshold method (respectively set as S, M) can be divided n into three kinds of circumstances.
And in these three cases, , , . The three kinds of duty ratio(  <  <  ).Corresponding to the
a) If n < 𝑆, at this stage the network load is small, adjust the duty ratio, the minimum duty cycleD1;

Duty ratio adjusted, the length of the frame period is not change, just listen time to adjustment, new activity time should be as follows:
T𝚗e𝗐l𝚒ste𝚗 = D𝚒 × T𝗍rame(i=1,2,3,)(3-1) The	is adjusted the value of duty ratio,
Increase the time of data packets, can transmit more data in the effective time. AFTA propose if the environment changed, send three consecutive decisions, so that we can make the node to transmit data traffic increase. Then, according to A-SMAC protocol make duty ratio increases, listen time increases, can make decision information sent out in time, reduce the decision delay data.

Results of Simulation Analysis

In order to compare the AFTA and Bayesian algorithm .We use theNS-2.35 emulator as experimental


platform [10].
We define the 90 nodes were randomly distributed in the area, between two nodes in turn form pairs of CBR stream transmission link. Adaptive incident detection algorithm adopts the method of sliding window- restart. Determine the length L of the sliding window, binary decision threshold th, and a threshold area parameters.

Fig. 4.2. Error performance comparison

Sliding window length L should according to the test to determine changes in the environment condition, general values between 3~5 more appropriate. Binary decision threshold	The simulation results as shown in the figure below.
We can see from the graph Fig. 4.1, the algorithm after joined the fault-tolerant judgment relative to A- SMAC protocol, the node energy consumption is lower.


Fig.4.2 shows error reduction performance of AFTA. We can seen from the diagram when data acquisition number L take more than three times, the AFTA is superior to using spatial correlation of (adjacent nodes N = 4)Bayesian fault tolerance detection algorithm at error reduction.

Conclusions

Energy consumption and event monitoring has been one of the important indices for wireless sensor network performance .In this paper, AFTA is proposed. This approach require data time correlation to fault tolerance through Threshold area. The proposed approach also determines the combination of algorithm and A - SMAC protocol.
The simulation results demonstrate that this approach can significantly reduce the unnecessary data to send and lead energy consumption is lower than A-SMAC protocol. It is also shown that the AFTA improve the ruling data transmission efficiency effectively, makes the system has a higher real-time performance and reliability is better. As a future extension, AFTA approach can be developed that can be used for even larger networks.
