Keywords:Automatic transplanterPlug seedlingPlanting onﬁlmsPlanting IndexTo improve the low transplanting efﬁciencies and simplify the complex structures of current automatic trans- planters, a mechanical high-speed transplanter for picking plug seedlings that is suitable for planting on plasticﬁlms was designed. The main components were an automatic seedling picking system and a basket-type plantingsystem, which were used for the following processes: automatic picking, planting, soil covering, and suppressionof plug seedlings. The performance test was performed on the automatic transplanter with 60-day-old pepperseedlings. The transplanting efﬁciency was tested at speeds of 40, 60, 90, and 120 plants·min

The results showed that the coefﬁcient of variation (CV) of the plant spacing and the missed transplanting rate increasedwith the planting frequency, whereas the quali ﬁed rate of planting perpendicularity and the quali ﬁed rate of planting decreased with the increase in the planting frequency. All planting indices met the JB/T 102912013 stan-dards. The results of this study showed that the auto-transplanter could perform high-speed transplanting on thebasis of completing the following functions: automatic picking, planting, soil covering, and suppression of plugseedlings.© 2021 The Authors.

Transplanting seedlings is an important task in crop production.Using transplants rather than direct seeding can avoid natural disasters,such as low temperatures and cold in spring, improving the survival rateof seedlings and the quality of crops (Brewer, 1994;Syed et al., 2019). At present, the transplanting machinery in China is still based on semi-automatic transplanting technology. The seedling planting mainlydepends on manual processes (Choi et al., 2001;Han et al., 2019a), which suffer from low efﬁciency and high labor requirements andcosts. Thus, it is urgent to design an automatic transplanting machineto replace the manual picking and discharging of seedlings ( Han et al., 2019b;Yu et al., 2012).Research on automatic transplanting machines has been previouslyreported (Yu et al., 2014). The Ferrari company in Italy developed theFutural series automatic transplanter based on the domestic agronomy,and it can automatically complete the picking and planting of ﬁve rows of plug tray seedlings with a planting frequency of 130plants·row
−1·min−1(Ni et al., 2015; Prasanna Kumar and Raheman,2011). The automatic transplanting machine developed by the BritishPearson company takes the seedlings out of the seedling trays usingthe seedling needles and places them horizontally on a conveyor belt.The plug seedlings are sequentially sent to the soil through the conveyorbelt. The planting frequency is 100 –135 plants·row−1·min−1(Wang et al., 2018;Wu et al., 2013). The HDl44 automatic transplanter devel-oped by the Transplant Systems in Australia can complete the trans-plantation of six rows of plug seedlings with a planting frequency of100 plants·row
−1min−1(Kutz et al., 1987). The three aforementioned transplanters perform ditched transplanting. In Japan, plots are small,and most of the transplanters developed there punch holes in a plasticmulchﬁlm (Shaw, 1993), such as the PA1A developed by Yanmar andthe SKP-100 T automatic transplanter developed by Kubota, whichpick up the plug seedlings with an end effector and cooperate withthe planter to push the plug seedlings into the soil. This machine has acompact structure, precise movement, and a planting frequency of upto 50 plants·row
−1·min−1(Hu et al., 2016;Han et al., 2018;Han et al., 2016a). However, the transplanter has only two rows of opera-tions and the mechanism is complex; thus, it is less ef ﬁcient than the three types of automatic transplanters mentioned above ( Han et al., 2013;Yang et al., 2018;Tian et al., 2010).Presently, the use of automatic transplanting machines is not popu-lar in China, mainly due to the complicated mechanical structures andhigh production costs, and it is difﬁcult to combine agricultural machin-ery and agronomics effectively (Yu et al., 2011). Therefore, the transplanting frequency of transplanting machines is generally low.Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 5 (2021) 64 –71

journal homepage:http://www.keaipublishing.com/en/journals/artificial-intelligence-in-agriculture/An automatic transplanter was designed by Yan of Jiangsu Universitywith a maximum transplanting efﬁciency of 60 plants·row
−1·min−1
(Yan et al., 2013). The structure of the seedling pick-up component ismainly driven by CAM, which wears out over time, thus reducing theprecision of the whole machine (Han et al., 2015;Han et al., 2016b). The automatic transplanting machine developed by Han of Jiangsu Uni-versity has a transplanting frequency of 60 plants·row
−1·min−1. Be- cause most of the seedling-picking devices use electrical controlsystems, electrical problems occur during transplanting, which cannotbe solved in a timely manner by farmers, so the adoption of thesedevices is limited (Liu et al., 2016). The transplanting efﬁciency of the 2ZXM-2 automatic plasticﬁlm mulching plug seedling trans-planter for vegetables developed by Li of Shi Hezi University is 62plants·row
−1·min−1(Li et al., 2017). Due to the limited number of ma-nipulators used to pick seedlings, it cannot meet the supply require-ments of 90 plants·row
−1·min−1for high-speed transplanting (Tai et al., 1994;Xu and Tang, 2019).Based on the above analysis, to achieve high-speed transplanting ofplug seedlings, a mechanical high-speed transplanting machine for plugseedlings is designed in this paper that can operate on a plastic ﬁlm mulch, which can complete the functions of automatic picking, deliver-ing, planting, soil covering, and suppression of plug seedlings duringtransplanting operations.1. Materials and methods1.1. Overall structureThe high-speed seedling auto-transplanter is mainly composed ofan automatic seedling picking system and the basket-type plantingsystem (Fig. 1). A ground wheel drives the basket-type planting sys-tem, which completes the transplanting process, and the automaticseedling picking system is responsible for continuously supplyingplug seedlings to the basket-type planting system. The automaticseedling picking system is symmetric on both sides, which allowsforﬁlm and double line reciprocating seedling picking. There is aﬁxed transmission ratio between the planting system and the auto-matic seedling picking system to ensure that the seedlings are accu-rately fed into the seedling cups. Its speci ﬁc design parameters are presented inTable 1.1.1.1. Structural schematic of automatic seedling picking systemThe main parts of the automatic seedling picking system includethe lifting rod, seedling guide, locking mechanism, manipulator,frame, pressure plate, adjusting bolt, feeding mechanism, and trans-mission mechanism, which have a left –right symmetric arrangement. When the assembly of the manipulator moves to the dischargeposition of the plug seedling, the pressure plate presses the seedlingrod to the bottom of the locking mechanism, and the manipulatoropens and disperses with the guide groove of the seedling guide.When the manipulator returns to the seedling picking position, itcloses with the guide groove of the seedling guide until the adjustingbolt and the locking mechanism touch, causing the lifting rod to losethe restriction of the locking mechanism; at this point, the liftingrod drives the manipulator to pick up the seedlings. The seedling feed-ing mechanism moves step by step, waiting for the next picking step(Fig. 2).1.2. ManipulatorThe structure of the manipulator is shown in Fig. 3. A compression spring is installed between adjacent clips, and one end is hinged to theslider. The slider can be moved up and down along the slide bar.When the slider moves upward, the clip is driven to move upwardalong the guide rod. At this time, the clips overcome the elastic forceof the compression spring and the pressing force of the limit bearing,forcing the clips to close and completing the clamping of the plug seed-ling. When the slider continues to move upward along the guide rod,the two clips maintain a balanced force under the action of the compres-sion spring and the limit bearing, and the clamping force remains un-changed until the slider moves up to the top of the ﬁxed base. When the slider moves down to the bottom of the ﬁxed base, the limit bearing is exactly tangent to the depression of the clip. At this time, the clip losesthe limitation of the limit bearing and is bounced off by the compressionspring. Finally, the plug seedlings are accurately put into the basket-typeplanting system.1.2.1. Analysis of manipulatorThe force analysis is conducted when the manipulator clip is closedto pick seedlings (Fig. 3a). The spring force of the compression spring,the extrusion force of the limit bearing, and the reaction force of thestem work together to reach a force balance, and the force analysis isas follows:

Compression spring designWhen the manipulator reaches the position to pick and dischargethe seedlings, the compression spring acts quickly to achieve the pre-cise clamping and discharging of the plug seedlings. If the spring stiff-ness is too small, the clips cannot be opened in time when themanipulator discharges the plug seedlings. As a result, plug seedlingscannot be fed into the basket-type planting system accurately. If thespring stiffness is too large, when the manipulator is used to clampthe plug seedlings, a greater lifting force is required to remove theplug seedlings. Therefore, the design of a reasonable spring structureparameters is important to improve the precision of the manipulatorplug seedlings. Considering that the compression spring must exhibita high strength and good performances, a C-grade carbon springsteel wire was selected. According to the mechanical design manual,the diameter of the compression spring wire d
0was estimated to be 1 mm, so the bending stressσ
Bwas 1800 MPa, and the spring indexCwas 10. The speciﬁc structural parameters of the compression springcan be calculated as follows:t¼dþ

Eqs.(4)–(6)show that the diameterdof the compression spring wire was 0.5 mm, the meandiameterDof the spring was 6 mm, the pitch tof the spring was 2.13 mm, and effective working circle nwas 15.1.3. Locking mechanismThe opening and closing of the manipulator is determined by thelocking mechanism, which is composed of a tension spring, slide panels,a separation rod, a return spring, and closed bearing bases ( Fig. 4a). After the manipulator picks up seedlings at point C, the locking mecha-nism can keep the manipulator always closed during the C→A process. When the manipulator moves to point A, the pressure plate presses thelifting rod to the bottom of the slide panels, then the return spring resetsthe separation rod. The manipulator will open all the way during theA→C process, until the adjusting bolt touches the separation rod atpoint C. At this time, the seedling lifting rod loses the restriction of theseparation rod, then the lifting rod will be dependent on the tensionspring to complete the picking of the plug seedling ( Fig. 4b).1.4. Seedling guideWhen picking seedlings, each plug seedling is required to be withinthe gripping range of the manipulator. When seedlings are discharged,each plug seedling can be aligned with the center of the rotating seed-ling cup. According to the plug tray parameters, the center distance ofthe guide groove at the end of picking and the spacing of guide groovesat the end of discharging can be determined, that is, h=6 3 . 5m ma n d H= 127 mm (Fig. 5).The center lines of the guide grooves aO,bO,cO,a n ddOextend from pointO. The seedling guide usesOO’as the axis of symmetry to separatethe guide grooves with a certain inclination angle. It is known from thegeometric relationship inFig. 5thatl

Transmission mechanismThe transmission mechanism is mainly composed of the manipula-tor reciprocating mechanism, the gear train, the transmission case,and the support frame (Fig. 6).The gear train is installed on the support frame, and the transmissionratio is 1:2. One end of the manipulator reciprocating mechanism is con-nected to the manipulator, and the other end is connected to the geartrain and the output shaft of the transmission case. When the manipu-lator picks up the plug seedlings, the transmission case drives thecrank to rotate, so that the manipulator picks up and discharges theplug seedlings back and forth.1.5.1. Kinematic analysis of manipulator reciprocating mechanismThe essential component of the manipulator reciprocating mecha-nism is the crank slider mechanism. The crank rotates around point Ato C′, the manipulator picks seedlings at point C, and the crank rotates

The manipulator then moves to point C ′to discharge the seedlings (Fig. 7).The travel velocity-ratio coefﬁcientKwas 1, the extreme position angle was 0°, and there was no sharp return phenomenon. Accordingto the movement and installation requirements of the mechanism(Sun et al., 2015), the slider motion strokeL

1.5.2. Simulation analysisTo determine the output torque of the transmission case, the maxi-mum transplanting frequency was set to 120 plants·min
−1, and the crank speed was 1.57 rad·s
−1, which were substituted into Eq.(14)to simulate the motion state of the slider ( Su, 2014). MATLAB was used to calculate the motion state of the slider at any time ( Pan, 2015). In the interval (0,π), the slider moved away, and when the crankwas turned toπ, the movement speed dropped to 0 m·s
−1.A tt h i s time, the manipulator picked multiple seedlings. In the interval(π,2π), the slider reversed movement, and when the crank was turnedto 2π, the movement speed dropped to 0 m·s
−1fromFig. 8(a). At this time, the manipulator discharged multiple seedlings.As shown inFig. 8(b), the acceleration of the slider was greater than0m · s
−2, and the force of the connecting rod on the slider was greaterthan the force of friction on the slider. When the crank angle θ
1wasπ3, the maximum slider acceleration was 1.25 m·s
−2. It is known that the mass of the crank slider mechanism driving part was 18 kg, and the slid-ing friction coefﬁcientμwas taken as 0.2. Thus, the minimum outputtorque of the transmission case satisﬁed the following:F/C2sinθ

According to Eq.(15), because the crank slider mech- anism was symmetrically distributed on the left and right sides, theminimum torque required by the transmission case was 42.4 N·m.1.6. Feeding mechanismThe seedling tray conveying mechanism is mainly composed of apallet, chain cross rod, pressure plate, ratchet, and underframe ( Fig. 9). The pallet isﬁxed on the underframe to support the plug seedlingtray. The power is input by the ratchet, and the drive shaft is driven bythe ratchet for intermittent rotation. The drive shaft drives the chaincross rod to move, making the plug seedling tray step shift. The platenabove the ratchet is used to keep the seedling tray tightly attached tothe pallet to prevent the seedling tray from shifting when the machineshakes. The seedling tray is placed between the pallet and the platen,the V-shaped gap of the seedling tray is stuck on the chain cross rods,

68and the seedling tray can be stepped on the pallet with the chaincross rods.1.6.1. RatchetThe stepping movement of the seedling tray is controlled by aratchet, and the power is input by the pawl support, which drivesthe coaxial sprocket to rotate stepwise, and the chain cross rod drivesthe seedling tray to feed longitudinally ( Fig. 10). The distance that the plug tray moves is equal to the arc length of the sprocket, and the centralangle of the sprocket is equal to the central angle αof the ratchet. The plug tray has eight holes longitudinally, and the distance between adja-cent holeslis 31.75 mm. The number of ratchet teeth nis 8, and the modulusmis 6.

Performance testTo evaluate the working performance of the automatic transplanter,performance tests were conducted in Ningjin County, Shandong Prov-ince, China, in June 2019. Before theﬁeld experiments, the land was re- quired to be ploughed completelyﬂat without large soil blocks, stones,straw, or weeds. The quality of the cultivated land met the requirementsof planting agronomy, and the soil moisture content was about 15%. Thetransplanted object was a 128-cell-type pepper plug seedling tray, andthe growth characteristics met the standards in Table 2. The planting mode of this machine was “oneﬁlm double rows,”the plant spacingXrwas adjusted to 0.25 m, and the row spacing was0.43 m. During the whole operation, one operator was needed to installthe plug seedling tray (Fig. 11).2.1. Evaluation indicesAccording to the JB/T 10291 –2013 standard, the machine wastransplanted at a low speed at planting frequencies of 40, 60, and 90plants·min
−1to verify the basic performance. It was then increased to120 plants·min
−1to observe the operation effect during high-speedtransplanting. Each time 128 plants were transplanted in a single row,theﬁrst 8 plants were removed, and the next 120 were continuouslytested. The number of missed, replanted, lodging, exposed, buried, andinjured seedlings were then counted, and the main performance indiceswere calculated, such as the coefﬁcient of variation (CV) of the plant spacing, missing transplanting rate, qualiﬁed rate of planting perpendic- ularity, and qualiﬁed rate of planting.2.1.1.

−1for low-speed transplanting, the CVincreased from 6.5% to 6.7%, which was less than the national standard value of15%. The highest missed planting rate was only 2.5%, which wasless than the national standard value of 5%. The minimum quali ﬁed rate of planting perpendicularity was 98%, which was higher than93%. The minimum qualiﬁed rate of planting was 97.2%, whichwas higher than 90% It can be seen from Table 3.T h u s ,t h el o w - speed transplanting process of this machine had a good effect andcould meet the pre-set working requirements.When the machine was transplanted at a high-speed of 120plants·min
−1,t h eCVwas 9.4%,Mwas 3%,Lwas 97.5%, andQwas 97.5%. Compared with low-speed transplanting, the CVandMincreased slightly, andLandQdecreased. However, all the indices met the JB/T10291–2013 standard. This showed that in the process of high-speedplanting, the automatic transplanter could achieve high speeds interms of picking, planting, and soil covering of the plug seedlings.4. ConclusionsThe aim of this study was to solve the problems of a lowtransplanting efﬁciency and complicated seedling picking mechanismsby designing a mechanical high-speed transplanter for picking seedlingssuitable for plasticﬁlm transplanting. The machine consists of an auto-matic seedling picking system and a basket-type planting system, whichcan automatically complete the functions of picking plug seedlings,planting, and covering soil.By analyzing the force when the manipulator picked the plug seed-lings, the structural parameters of the compression spring were deter-mined. The kinematics and dynamics of the reciprocating mechanismwere analyzed, and the relationship between the velocity and accelera-tion of the manipulator was obtained using MATLAB when the plantingfrequency was 120 plants·min−1. The minimum output torque of thetransmission case was 42.4 N·m
−1.The mechanical high-speed transplanter for picking seedlings atlow speeds veriﬁed the basic performance. We then attempted to in-crease the planting frequency to 120 plants·min
−1for high-speed transplanting, under which the coefﬁcient of variation for the plant spacing was 9.4%, the rate of missed planting was 3%, the quali ﬁed rate of planting perpendicularity was 97.5%, and the quali ﬁed rate of planting was 97.5%. All indices met the JB/T 10291 –2013 requirements. The results showed that the auto-transplanter could achieve high-speedtransplanting based on the completion of the basic functions of auto-matic picking, planting, soil covering, and suppression.Declaration of Competing InterestThe authors declare that they have no known competing ﬁnancial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to in ﬂu- ence the work reported in this paper.AcknowledgmentsThis wok was supported by the National Key Research Program ofChina (2017YFD0700800), the National Natural Science Foundation ofChina (50905153, 51565059), Autonomous Region Key ResearchProjects (2018B01001-3), and Autonomous Region Tianshan YouthProgram (2017Q018).We thank LetPub (www.letpub.com) for its linguistic assistance during the preparation of this manuscript.References
