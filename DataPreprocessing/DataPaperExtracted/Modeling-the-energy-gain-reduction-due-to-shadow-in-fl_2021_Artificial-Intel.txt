Article history:Received 13 May 2021Received in revised form 10 July 2021Accepted 25 August 2021Available online 24 September 2021Energy lost due to shadow in the absorber plate of solar collectors can decrease the solar energy gain. In somestudies, mathematical modeling was applied for calculating the energy gain reduction due to shadow in ﬂat- plate solar collectors. In this study, ANN method was developed for modeling the energy gain reduction. Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) with one hidden layer and a range of neurons (5 –30) by two training algorithms (LM and BR) and tangent sigmoid activation function (TanSig) were used by help of K-fold cross validation method.In theﬁrst section, six set of solar collector dimensions were used (1×1; 1×1.5; 1×2; 1.5×1.5; 1.5×2 and 2×2).In the second section all the range of dimensions were used as the inputs. The results of the ﬁrst section showed that MLP with BR training algorithm can predict the energy gain reduction with minimum MAPE and RMSE in allthe categories. The best results related to (1.5×1.5) dimension that achieved a MAPE of 0.15 ± 0.09% and RMASEof 4.42 ± 2.43 KJm
−2year−1, respectively. The results of the second section indicated that BR is a better trainingalgorithm than LM. The MAPE and R
2factors for the best topology (5-27-1) were 0.0610 ± 0.0051% and 0.9999 ± 0.0001, respectively. The results of the sensitivity analysis showed that height has the biggest impacton total energy gain reduction due to shadow in ﬂat-plate solar collectors. Finally, the results of this study indi- cated that by using ANN and decrease the energy lost, the ef ﬁciency of solar collectors can be increased in all applications such as industry and agriculture.© 2021 The Authors.

1. IntroductionFossil fuels are not good sources for future energy supply because oflimited resources, priceﬂuctuations, environmental pollution, etc.(Fadaei et al., 2018). So, the human shouldﬁnd another replacement re- source for energy generation. Solar energy can be continuously used byhumans because of its cleanliness and abundance ( Kalani et al., 2017). Between all the solar energy systems, solar collectors and especiallyﬂat-plate solar collectors are widely used by people as a cheap and inex-pensive energy system for warming air and water ( Al-Waeli et al., 2019). They are simpler to manufacture, they receive direct and indirectradiation and do not require solar trackers ( Kalogirou, 2014). Solar col- lectors can be used in agriculture and industry. In agriculture, the green-house extended the use of solar energy from post-harvest to crop-production (Taki et al., 2018a). Today greenhouses are ubiquitouswith a huge variety of designs providing a wide range of modi ﬁed cli- mates for plant growth. Solar energy also ﬁnds use in agriculture in solar water pumping for irrigation and in the desalination of brackishwater (Farhadi and Taki, 2020). Solar cooking has taken the use ofsolar energy in the food production chain directly to the end-user.Broader industrial uses of solar energy have also tended to be linkedto food and beverage production because the temperatures requiredcan be satisﬁed readily in many climates by a well-designed solar ther-mal system. Non-agricultural technologies such as solar furnaces haveconsiderable potential but have had limited practical use to-date ( Taki et al., 2018b).Flat-plate solar collectors typically have one or two layers of trans-parent glass on the absorber plate to reduce losses due to convectiveairﬂow (Dufﬁe and Beckman, 2013). This transparent glass is locatedat a distance from the absorbent plate. Increasing this distance reducesconvective losses. But, it creates shadows on the absorbent plate and re-duces the absorption radiation of the sun and ultimately decreases theperformance (Farhadi and Taki, 2020). This distance is suggested in some researches between 4 and 5 cm ( Nahar and Garg, 1980). The best distance can be calculated by shadow estimation, which has beendone in previous research byFarhadi and Taki (2020). In this study, the authors decided to introduce a fast and accurate method for calcu-lating the energy gain reduction inﬂat-plate solar collectors due to shadow by using Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI).AI with some simplistic modeling of real neural systems, is widelyused for solving various science problems.

journal homepage:http://www.keaipublishing.com/en/journals/artificial-intelligence-in-agriculture/is so wide (Taki et al., 2018a). It covers classiﬁcation to applications, such as interpolation, estimation, detection, etc. ( Rohani et al., 2019; Amini et al., 2020). Maybe the most important advantage of this methodis its high speed and acceptable accuracy than traditional mathematicalmethods (Alonso et al., 2012). Nowadays various models of AI includingArtiﬁcial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Adap-tive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and …, are used in most as- pects of engineering science (Elsheikh et al., 2019). ANNs are dynamic systems that transmit empirical knowledge or the law behind the datainto a network structure. These systems learn general rules based onthe calculations of the numerical data or examples and are intelligentsystems (Alonso et al., 2012). The scientists predict that ANN will beused in the future in all aspect of human life because of its ability tomodeling the linear and nonlinear systems as well as the need for nopreconditions (Rohani et al., 2018).Application of AI in solar energy systems in some studies was evalu-ated.Table 1indicates some of the recent researches on different typesof solar energy systems using AI. In a research, ANN with three hiddenlayers was used for evaluation the output of Photovoltaic Thermal(PV/T) air collector (Dimri et al., 2019). In this study, ANN applied for prediction the outputﬂuctuating (thermal and electrical energy gainand also overall thermal energy and exergy gain). The results indicatedthat the traditional techniques were complex compared to ANNmethod. The ANN model based on the three inputs (global, diffuse andambient solar radiation) showed a reasonable prediction accuracy(MSE = 0.086) and (R= 0.9997). Some other researchers used differ-ent types of ANN models for PV/T systems and reported reasonable pre-diction accuracy than traditional methods ( Jia et al., 2019). In another study, ANN was used to predict the output in parabolic trough solar col-lector tube (Heng et al., 2019). The results showed that ANN is fast andaccurate prediction method for calculating the exit temperature in par-abolic trough solar collectors. Some others studies showed the ANNmethod is accurate, fast and reliable ( Rohani et al., 2019;Al-Waeli et al., 2019;Amini et al., 2020;Rohani et al., 2018;Taki et al., 2018b).1.1. Scope, innovations and structureBased on the above literatures andTable 1,t h i sr e s e a r c ha t t e m p t st o apply ANN for calculating the energy gain reduction due to shadow inﬂat-plate solar collectors. This study considers all the latitudes and thedimensions of theﬂat plate solar collectors. So, the results can be usefulfor all the solar energy engineers in the world. Main goals of thisresearch are: Application of ANN-MLP model using two training algo-rithms include Levenberg Marquardt (LM) and Bayesian Regularization(BR), Application of K-fold cross validation method for increasing theaccuracy and reliability of the results and sensitivity analysis for indicat-ing the share of the inputs on output changing.It is also theﬁrst attempt to investigate the application of ANN forcalculating the energy gain reduction in one of the solar energy systems.In this study,Section 2shows the methodology of the article –focusing

The last section is the overall conclusions and recom-mendations of this study.2. Materials and methods2.1. Data collectionFlat-plate solar collectors are getting more attention every day due totheir simplicity and reasonable price. The absorber plate in these collec-tors is enclosed to reduce heat loss with a transparent glass above andheat-insulated walls from around. But often shadow covers some part ofabsorber plate, which reduces the performance. In the previous study(Farhadi and Taki, 2020), a mathematical model was used to determinethe factors affecting shadow formation (latitude, tilt angle and collectordimensions). The results showed that height and width had the highesteffect and latitude had the least sharei ns h a d o wf o r m a t i o n .I nt h ep r e s e n tstudy, the authors try to estimate the energy loss due to shadow in ﬂat- plate solar collectors using AI. The required data was extracted from thestudy ofFarhadi and Taki (2020).I nt h eﬁrst step, the data were catego- rized based on the dimensions. So, based on the Table 2, six categories were selected based on the popular and practical purpose.In the second section, all the data were used for analysis ( Table 3). In this section, more than 8000 rows of data were extracted and preparedfor ANN analysis.2.2. Artiﬁcial neural networkThe MLP neural network will generate the output vector ( zq)f o re a c h q(q=1 . 2 . 3…Q) by receiving the input vector (x
q). The goal is to adopt the correct network parameters to achieve the actual output that isclose to the desired output with high accuracy ( Ranjbar et al., 2013). In this study, basic Back Propagation (BP) algorithm was used for learningthe network. Initially, the data were randomly divided into two groups:training set (60% of total data) and test set (40% of total data). If this seg-mentation does not produce the desired results, this step can be repeatedagain. Before applying the raw data, the data must be normalized, be-cause the learning algorithm with the raw data cannot produce the suit-able results. When using the Tangent Sigmoid (TanSig) activationfunction, the best data conversion range is [−1 to +1]. Linear normaliza- tion was used to convert the data (Rohani et al., 2018):x

are the upper and lower limits of data ranges, respectively.In this study two training algorithms were used: LevenbergMarquardt (LM) and Bayesian regularization (BR). Due to the highspeed of network response and avoidance of complexity, a single layernetwork was used in this study (Ranjbar et al., 2013). The number of neurons in hidden layer increased as the results improved and was con-sidered constant after the error increased. In this study, the maximumnumber of neurons in hidden layer was 30. Fig. 1. shows the overall structure of MLP model with all the components in this study.2.3. K-fold cross validationIn this research, K-fold cross validation method was used for increas-ing the conﬁdence of ANN outputs. In this method, the validation dataare divided into different categories of K, based on their type and num-ber, and are evaluated by each algorithm. In each step, K subsets is usedfor accreditation and the others (K-1) are applied for training(Rodriguez et al., 2010). This K procedure is repeated and all data areused for training and validation (in this study, K = 5). Finally, the aver-age results are validated as aﬁnal estimation. Application of K-fold as astochastic subdivision in this method can increase the distribution inthe ANN process and makes the neural network normally used as apractical method with acceptable results ( Taki et al., 2018a). In some studies, this method was used and the authors reported that the resultscan be used in the experimental sections because of reliability ( Taki et al., 2018b;Rohani et al., 2019;Amini et al., 2020). In order to evaluate the performance of ANN-MLP model, Mean Ab-solute Percentage Error (MAPE), coefﬁcient of determination (R
2), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Efﬁciency Factor (EF) were used (Rohani et al., 2019):MAPE¼

Also, MATLABsoftware 2018a was used to analyze neural network and regressionmethods.Fig. 2shows the whole procedure of methodology in this study.3. Results and discussion3.1. The best algorithm for MLPIn this study two training algorithms were used for MLP model (LMand BR). The Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm is a method for ﬁnd- ing the minimum of a multivariate nonlinear function that has become astandard method for solving the least squares problem in nonlinearfunctions (Najaﬁet al., 2009). Bayesian Regularization (BR) algorithmis more robust than other traditional algorithms such as standardback-propagation and can decrease the need for long cross-validation.BR is a mathematical process that change a nonlinear regression into awell-posed statistical problem in the manner of a ridge regression. Theadvantage of BR is that this method is robust and the validation process,such as back propagation, is unnecessary ( Amini et al., 2020). For trans- fer function, TanSig was used. This type of transfer function is very pop-ular and many researchers applied this method in ANN studies ( Taki et al., 2018b;Ranjbar et al., 2013;Rohani et al., 2019). In theﬁrst section, six types of data based on the collector dimensions were used formodeling. Two training algorithms and several number of neurons inhidden layer (1,2, 3….,30) were used for ANN process.Fig. 3. shows the results of MLP model with two training algorithm (LM-BR) to pre-dict the energy lost due to shadow for different dimensions of ﬂat- plate solar collectors. As the results show, the BR algorithm has the bet-ter performance than LM in all the six categories. The MAPE factor wasvaried between 0.119%–0.267% and 0.879%–1.87%, for BR and LM algo- rithms, respectively.The results show that the BR algorithm can make accurate outputdata and based on the K-fold cross validation, this model (MLP-BR)can use in real experimental applications. So for other analysis, the BR

190was used.Fig. 4shows the RMSE and EF factors for the best neuron inthe hidden layer by BR algorithm. The results of Fig. 5show that for the six dimensions (1×1; 1×1.5; 1×2; 1.5×1.5; 1.5×2 and 2×2) thebest topologies are: 5-14-1; 5-15-1; 5-8-1; 5-18-1; 5-16-1; 5-10-1, re-spectively. The lowest RMSE is related to (1.5×1.5) dimension. Alsothis dimension has the highest EF (0.9999). The results of this ﬁgure show that the number of neurons in the hidden layer can play an impor-tant role in theﬁnal performance but the higher number of neurons inthe hidden layer is not always a reason for increasing the ef ﬁciency and accuracy of the neural network model. Table 4shows the overall performance of MLP model for the best neurons in the hidden layer byBR algorithm in the train and test phases. The results of Table 5show that MLP model with proposed structure can predict the energy lostdue to shadow for all the dimensions with high accuracy. For ﬂat-plate solar collectors with (1.5×1.5) dimension, MLP model can use withhigher performance than other dimensions.

191There is not any similar research about collectors but in other appli-cations, some researchers reported similar results about ANN models.For example,Kalogirou (2006), applied ANN model to estimate the col-lector performance parameters and reported that this method can usewith high precision. Also the authors indicate that the performance ofANN can be improved by more training and use other new and suf ﬁcient algorithms.In a similar study, ANN models (MLP and RBF) were applied to pre-dict the output yield of wheat production ( Taki et al., 2018b). The results showed that ANN models can use with high performance to predict theTable 5Selection the best neuron in MLP model with LM algorithm by application of K-fold cross validation method.Number of neurons Train Test TotalMAPE % R

192wheat yield for the next cultivation. In another study, Ghritlahre and Prasad (2018), developed MLP and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)models to predict the heat transfer of two different types of roughenedsolar air heaters. The results showed that ANN models with 5-10-1 to-pology can predict the heat transfer characteristics with high accuracy(R
2= 0.9953) than MLR. In another study, ANN-MLP model was usedto predict the performance of solar chimney ﬁlled with phase change materials (Fadaei et al., 2018). The results showed that the correlationcoefﬁcient between the actual and predicted data was more than 0.99and also the relative error is less than 3%.In the second section, all the data based on the Table 2were used for ANN analysis. In this section the effect of data size can be evaluated. Soas the last section, the TanSig transfer function with LM and BR trainingalgorithms and the different number of neurons in hidden layer(1,2,3…,30) were used for ANN modeling.Table 5shows the results of MLP-LM model with different number of neurons in the hidden layerin train, test and total phases.The results ofTable 6indicated that, the best topology with highestperformance is 5–20-1. Total MAPE and R
2for this structure are 1.0397 ± 0.2888 and 0.9970 ± 0.0017, respectively. Based on theTable 5, the MAPE of MLP-LM structure in total phase was varied be-tween 1.0397 and 1.3982%. Also, this table show that the data size oftraining has not a signiﬁcant effect on total MAPE of MLP-LM structurein this study. So the analysis was repeated for MLP-BR model withsame structure of MLP-LM (Table 6). The results ofTable 6show that MAPE and R
2at total phase for the best topology with MLP-BR structure(5–27-1) are 0.0610 ± 0.0051% and 0.9999 ± 0.0001, respectively.MAPE for different number of neurons in the hidden layer is varied be-tween 0.0610 ± 0.0051 to 0.8664 ± 0.1482%. The results of MLP-BRanalysis show that the standard deviation in train, test and total phasesis very low compared with the same results of MLP-LM. The MAPE forthe best topology (5–27-1) in MLP-BR is more than 16 times lowerthan the same MAPE for the best topology by MLP-LM (5 –20-1). Table 7shows a brief comparison with all statistical parameters be-tween the best topologies by LM and BR training algorithms.Fig. 5.A shows Cross-Correlation of predicted and actual values bythe best topology (5–27-1) and B: shows the convergence diagram ofthis topology at train, test and validation phases. Fig. 5A shows that after 677 repetitions, the MSE for train, test and total phases reachedto the minimum value and MLP-BR model was learned to predict theoutput with lowest error. Also the next section (B) shows that this to-pology can accounted more than 99% of total actual variability in thereal data. The correlation coefﬁcient between the actual and predicteddata in train, test, validation and total phases are very high. So, thismodel can show the relation between the inputs and output with highaccuracy and can be accepted for experimental applications. Many re-searchers reported that the ANN model could solve problem equationand predict the results with high accuracy in all aspect of sciences(Elsheikh et al., 2019).Sözen et al. (2008), applied ANN method to eval- uate the performance ofﬂat-plate solar collector and reported that themaximum deviation between the actual and predicted data by ANNmodel was about 2.55%.3.2. Sensitivity analysisIn the last section, the sensitivity analysis was evaluated for MLP-BRstructure. By sensitivity analysis, the share of each inputs on the outputcan be calculated.Fig. 6shows the sensitivity analysis for MLP-BR(5–27-1) in this study. As it can be seen, the share of height on the en-ergy gain reduction due to shadow inﬂat-plate solar collectors, is higher than other parameters. This is similar to the result of mathematicalmodeling (Farhadi and Taki, 2020). So,ﬁnding the best height in all the dimensions and in all the latitudes and tilts, is a main factor for op-timization the energy lost due to shadow in ﬂat-plate solar collectors. By the results of this study, engineers canﬁnd the energy lost inﬂat-plate solar collectors in the world and the optimum dimensions and heightcan beﬁnd by ANN model before construction. The authors stronglysuggested to adopt the best ANN models for every county based onthe local dimensions ofﬂat-plate solar collectors and decrease the en-ergy lost and improve the efﬁciency of solar collectors.

1934. ConclusionIn this study, ANN-MLP method was developed for modeling the en-ergy gain reduction due to shadow inﬂat-plate solar collectors. Two training algorithms (LM-BR) with TanSig transfer function and K-foldcross validation method were used for ANN modeling. Four statisticalparameters including Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean AbsolutePercentage Error (RMSE), Efﬁciency Factor (EF) and correlation of deter-mination (R
2) were used for evaluate the precision of ANN model. Theinputs including Latitude, Length, Width, Height and tilt were extractedfromFarhadi and Taki (2020). In this study, two scenarios were evalu-ated. In theﬁrst scenario, the dimensions (Length×Width) were dividedinto 5 categories including (1×1; 1×1.5; 1×2; 1.5×1.5; 1.5×2 and 2×2)and in the second, all the range of dimensions (Length: 0.5 –2.5 and Wight: 0.5–2.5 m) were used in the inputs data. The results showedthat MLP-BR has the lowest MAPE and RMSE than MLP-LM in the twoscenarios. MAPE for different number of neurons in the hidden layerwas varied between 0.0610 ± 0.0051 to 0.8664 ± 0.1482% in the secondscenario. Also, the best topology was (5 –27-1) that achieved to MAPE and R
2of 0.0610 ± 0.0051% and 0.9999 ± 0.0001, respectively. The re-sults of sensitivity analysis indicated that height has the biggest effecton the output (42%) followed by tilt (37%) and latitude (14%). The re-sults of this study showed that ANN method can predict the outputdata with reasonable accuracy and also combination the K-fold crossvalidation with ANN can increase the reliability of the ANN outputs.Declaration of Competing InterestThe authors do not have any type of conﬂict of interest.AcknowledgementThe authors would like to thank the editor in chief and the anony-mous referees for their valuable suggestions and useful comments thatimproved the paper content substantially.
