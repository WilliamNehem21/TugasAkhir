As the size of the Smart Grid (SG) grows, the economic signiﬁcance of power generation, consumptionand storage scheduling becomes more and more apparent. A proper scheduling for electricity generation,consumption and storage will also ensure the reliability of the SG and extend the operational lives of itsconstituent units. Besides, it can achieve economical and ecological beneﬁts for the SG. In this work, wepropose a multi-objective cooperative scheduling consisting of two main modules: (1) the Preference-based Compromise Builder and (2) the Multi-objective Scheduler. The Preference-based CompromiseBuilder aims at generating the best balance or what we call ‘the compromise’ between the preferencesor associations of the sellers and the buyers that must exchange power simultaneously. Once done,the Multi-objective Scheduler aims at proposing a power schedule for the associations, in order toachieve three-dimensional beneﬁts: economical by reducing the electricity costs, ecological by minimiz-ing the toxic gas emissions, and operational by reducing the peak load of the SG and its components, andby increasing their comfort. Conducted experiments showed that the proposed algorithms provide con-vincing results./C2112017 The Authors. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of King Saud University.

1. IntroductionThe Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) repre-sent unprecedented opportunities to move the power systems intoa new era of reliability and efﬁciency that will contribute to oper-ational, economical and ecological improvements. During thistransition period, it is important to implement adequate tech-niques allowing to ensure that the beneﬁts envisioned from theSG (cf.Fig. 1) become a reality. Commonly considered as a keymechanism towards a more efﬁcient and cost effective SG, theDemand Side Management (DSM) [6,16]refers to the planning and implementation of the utility companies’ programs
1designed to directly or indirectly inﬂuence the consumer consumption inthe aim of reducing the system peak load and electricity costs.DSM techniques can be mainly gathered in two maincategories:– Theload shifting[12]which involves shifting the power con-sumption from on-peak to off-peak periods– Theenergy efﬁciency and conservation[2]which encourages con- sumers to reduce their consumption in order to reduce theirelectricity bills and the peak load.Although important the emergence of tools provided by theenergy efﬁciency and conservation approaches, such as TiDomus[7], we focus here on the load shifting, and more speciﬁcally onthe power scheduling, since it has been observed that it is easierto motivate users to reschedule their needs rather than askingthem to reduce their consumption [12]. Several approaches have been provided in the literature to address the power schedulingproblem[11,19,15,1,5,17]. However, and to the best of our knowl-edge, none of the them fully addresses the following challenges:–Operational Challenges: Several limitations can be mentionedregarding the operational aspect:1.The consumer discomfort: while the consumers are enjoy-ing their reduced electricity bills when shifting their con-sumption from on-peak to off-peak periods, they might risk

discomfort related to the delay time of receiving theirdesired power.2.The local peaks: while trying to reduce the whole SG peakload, it is essential to consider the individual SG components’peak loads as well. This would conduct to increase the relia-bility of the components and decrease the local failure risks.3.The consumption wise: the current shifting programs[11,19,15,5]provide consumption scheduling without con-sidering the production nor the storage scheduling (withthe exception of few approaches[1,17]) which negatively impact their efﬁciency in shaping the peak load, reducingthe electricity bills and minimizing the gas emissions effects.–Economical Challenges: Knowing that the electricity pricerelies on the demand and supply over a speciﬁc period [10], an adequate scheduling is expected to shift loads during periodsof high market prices (peak hours) and consequently minimizethe electricity costs.–Ecological Challenges: A signiﬁcant power production frompollutant energy sources leads to a signiﬁcant toxic gas emis-sions. Hence, it is essential to provide a power productionscheduling allowing to reduce the bad emissions and effectson the environment by reducing the simultaneous toxic powerproduction.To address the aforementioned challenges, we introduce hereMOCSF, a ‘Multi-Objective Cooperative Scheduling Framework’designed for the power scheduling in the SG. MOCSFaims at scheduling a set of couples, each consisting of a seller and buyer,working together in a mutual spirit so to ensure a better reductionof the economical, operational and ecological costs and impactswithin the SG. In addition, our approach presents several advan-tages over existing approaches, namely:1. It provides a scheduling coverage able to consider all of thepower consumption, production and storage entities of the SG,2. It considers multiple energy sources (unlike existingapproaches[11,19,15,1,5,17]that studied the interaction ofthe consumers with only one energy source),3. It takes into account the SG components’ preferences unlikecurrent approaches[19,1,17]that consider them partially.The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2provides details about existing power scheduling techniques and theirdrawbacks regarding aforementioned challenges. Section 3details the ‘MOCSF’ modules. An illustrative example is provided aftereach step to ease the understanding of each module. In Section 4, the experiments conducted to validate our approach and the mainresults obtained are presented. Section 5concludes the paper.2. Related workMany approaches have been proposed in the literature to solvethe power scheduling problem. Current approaches can be catego-rized into two main groups[8]: semi-automatic schedulers [11,19,5]and automatic schedulers[17,15,1]schedulers. In the semi-automatic schedulers, the consumers inject their desiredpreferences (e.g., desired temperature, appliances start time pref-erences, etc.) during the scheduling, contrarily to the automaticschedulers where there is no human intervention. In our work,we will be focusing on six scheduling approaches, that vary in theirscheduler, optimization problem type, appliances types andobjectives.2.1. Semi-automatic schedulersIn[11], the authors developed a distributed power consumptionscheduling algorithm aiming at reducing the electricity bills andbalancing the total power demand when multiple consumers sharea single energy source. To do so, the authors formulated a game-theory technique, where the players are the consumers and thestrategies are their corresponding power consumption schedules(represented as vectors). The objective function of each consumernwhen choosing the strategy

Salameh et al. / Applied Computing and Informatics 15 (2019) 67–79For each playern2N, the power consumption scheduling isgenerated randomly. The intuition behind this choice is that theauthors considered that, at the beginning, a player nhas no prior information about others players. Then, a loop is executed untilthe algorithm converges. Within the loop, the objective functionis resolved using an IPM algorithm [3], resulting a new schedule for each player. The same process is repeated until there is nonew announced schedule for all the players. Simulations resultsshowed that the proposed distributed algorithm can reduce theelectricity bills and the peak of average ratio.In[19], the authors developed a meta-heuristic scheduling algo-rithm, aiming at reducing the dissatisfaction and the energy cost ofa set of homes in a district, and the variance of the grid. To do so,the authors divided the home appliances into two categories:power-shiftable and time-shiftable appliances. The objective func-tion is formulated as follows:

The dissatisfaction functionU ijðtÞrepresents the difference between the desired temperature and the actual indoor tempera-ture for the space heater at time t, and the difference between the desired hot water temperature and the actual hot water tem-perature for the water heater at time t. The authors used the Cooperative Particle Swarm Optimization(CPSO) (cf.Fig. 2) to ﬁnd the optimal scheduling of the appliances.Experimental results showed the positive impact of the householdscoordination in decreasing the peak loads and reducing the powercosts.In[5], the authors developed a power consumption schedulingaiming at reducing the electricity bills of the consumers with aminimum impact on their consumption preferences. The authorsconsidered that the scheduler needs to determine the consumptionvectorXi¼½x i;1;xi;1;...;x i;H/C138for each unitiin the determined zone horizonH, whereHconsists ofMsegments comprised ofmtime intervals, i.e.,H¼M/C3m. Then, a shrinking horizon optimizationproblem[4]has been deﬁned as follows:

whereSðjÞðHÞis the total electricity cost in thejthoptimization step,P

jmh¼jmþ1 ^SðthÞis the esti- mated energy cost based on the forecasted electricity prices forsubsequent time intervals. Note that the user preferences are con-sidered by including the time intervals where energy schedulingis performed for uniti. Without giving details about the obtainedresults, the authors assume that the proposed model can minimizethe electricity consumption costs while including the consumers’preferences.
2.2. Automatic schedulersIn[15], the authors formulated an optimization model forhouseholds power scheduling, aiming at reducing the electricitycosts and the peak load of the grid. To do so, the authors integratedthe incentive and inconvenience concepts. The incentive is offeredto the users during peak times to encourage them to reduce theirconsumption, while the inconvenience seeks to reduce the differ-ence between the baseline and the optimal appliances schedule.The objective function is deﬁned as follows:

The formu- lated model is solved using the MINLP algorithm, which utilizesthe Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) [18]and the Non-Linear Pro- gramming (NLP)[3]. Simulations results showed that using thismodel, the consumers realized 25 %of electricity cost reduction. Noting that this percentage is affected by several factors, such asthe number of shiftable appliances and the prices of the on-peakand off-peak times.
In[17], the authors developed a power storage scheduling algo-rithm aiming at managing the storage in the grid in a way of savingenergy and reducing the reliance on the non-renewable energysources. To do so, the authors formulated a game-theorist tech-nique, where the players are the consumers and the strategiesare their storage schedule vectors. The objective function of eachplayeriwhen choosing the strategys

Similar to[15], the authors in[1]proposed an energy storage and loads scheduling algorithms aiming at reducing the electricitycosts and the peak load hours. In this study, the electricity loadanalysis is done by grouping the day periods into three time zoneseach representing a cluster. Each cluster represents the loadsexpected to be launched during a given period. The cost requiredto satisfy the power needs of a given cluster j, consisting of K appli-ances is given by:

his the market power price at a period h. An optimal load and storage scheduling shouldsatisfy the consumers’ requirements at the lowest cost in each per-iod without harming the grid stability. To do so, the objective func-tion has been deﬁned as follows:

Here, linear programming was applied in resolving the optimizationproblem. Simulation results showed a 20 %of peak load reduction and a 17%of costs savings.2.3. DiscussionTable 1shows a comparison between the existing DSMapproaches highlighting their strengths and drawbacks withrespect to the aforementioned challenges. On can observe thefollowing:–Scheduling coverage: All the existing DSM approaches[11,19,15,1,5,17]focused only on the power consumptionscheduling, with the exception of[1,17]that addressed the stor- age scheduling as well. However, none of them covers thepower production scheduling.–Consumer satisfaction: Few approaches[1,17,19]took into account the consumers’ satisfaction. In [19], the consumers’ comfort is ensured by reducing the gap between the desiredand the actual hot water, and between the desired and theactual indoor temperature. However, in [1,17], the satisfaction is measured by the delay time between the desired start timeand the real operation of its household appliances. Contrariwiseto[11,15,5], where this aspect was completely absent.–Multiple energy sources: To the best of our knowledge, all theDSM approaches[11,19,15,1,5,17]target the interaction of theconsumers while assuming having only one utility grid and con-sequently one energy source.–Restricted goal: Another limitation of all the existingapproaches is that they do not cope with the three objectives(operational, ecological, and economical) of a successful DSM.In almost all the approaches[11,19,15,1,5,17], the goal was mainly to reduce the electricity costs (economical aspect). In[11,19], the peak load reduction (operational aspect) isaddressed aiming at reducing the peak hours in the power grid.However, none of the approaches considers the gas emissionreduction (ecological aspect).All these limitations lead us to develop a new DSM cooperativemodel, allowing the scheduling of the power production, consump-tion and storage while considering the three-objective aspect ofthe DSM and the components’ preferences.3. Multi-objective cooperative schedulingIn this section, we detail our ‘Multi-Objective CooperativeScheduling Framework’ orMOCSFaiming at reducing electricity bills, peak loads and environmental bad effects, while enhancingthe comfort of the SG components. In order to conceive a coopera-tive environment,MOCSFtakes as input a set of couples, or whatwe call: seller-to-buyer associations, each consisting of a sellerand buyer having mutual beneﬁts in working together, with theirdesired schedules reﬂecting their operational preferences in termsof: start time, end time and power quantity (to sell or to buy). Themain reason behind this choice relies on the fact that we do notwant to schedule the sellers and the buyers randomly but werather want to maintain the power exchange between the sellersand the buyers having the biggest interest in working together(the interest can be expressed via an objective function that takes

Several approaches have been proposed in the literature toprovide appropriate associations[13,14]. Our approach is based on[14], where the authors provided a dedicated clustering algo-rithm aiming at gathering the components that have mutual ben-eﬁts. To do so, they proposed a Digital Ecosystem DE cooperativemodel for SG management, that consists of two main modules:(1) the Alliances Builder and (2) the Seller2Buyer matcher. The Alli-ances Builder provides an appropriate clustering algorithm, aimingat gathering all theDEheterogeneous components, having similarneeds and preferences. Once done, the Seller2Buyer matcher isapplied inside each cluster and between clusters, targeting a bettercollaboration inside the SG. Note that, their needs and preferencesare expressed via a three-dimensional objective function that takesinto account the operational aspect by reducing the transmissionpower losses wasted over the distribution lines and maintaininga power balance (between the generation and the consumption),the economical aspect by minimizing the environmental impactdue to the conventional energy sources, and the ecological aspectby ensuring a stable energy trading via a cost reduction.For the rest of our paper, we will be using the following exam-ple: Let us consider an SG consisting of 9 components having thepower generation(g), demand (d) and storage (s) as shown in Table 3. After classifying the SG components, they will be put intothree main categories: the sellers willing to sell their power sur-plus (nR
1!nRþ1,nR 4!nRþ2;nR 6!nRþ3;nR 8!nRþ4), the buyers willing to buy their power needs ( nR
2!nR/C01;nR 3!nR/C02;nR 5! nR
/C03;nR 9!nR/C04), and the self-satisﬁed components ( nR 5!nR01) (c.f.Table 2.).After applying a clustering algorithm aiming at gathering the SGcomponents having mutual interests in working together based onthe minimization of an objective function that takes into accountthe ecological, economical and operational costs, the result is aset of couples or seller-to-buyer associations as follows:
Association1:ðnRþ1;nR/C03Þ/C0nRþ1should sellnR/C03a quantity of 14 kW Association2:ðnR

þ4;nR/C02Þ/C0nRþ4should sellnR/C02a quantity of 2 kW8>>><>>>:As shown inFig. 3,MOCSFconsists of two main modules:Preference-based compromise builder andMulti-objective Schedulerdetailed in what follows.3.1. Preference-based compromise builderAs mentioned before, the input of this module is a set of seller-to-buyer associations, each composed of a seller and a buyer. Note that,each seller or buyer might belong to one or several associations.While sellers and buyers of the same association have to exchangepower, each one of them has its own preferences to be respectedso to establish a successful cooperative SG. Hence, the ﬁrst steptowards each association scheduling is to ﬁnd the best balance orwhat we call the compromise, between the preferences of therelated seller and buyer. Let us consider the ﬁrst association(nR
þ1;nR/C03) of the illustrative example.nRþ1andnR/C03should be sched- uled together, howevernR
þ1may have several preferences that aredifferent fromnR
/C03’s: for instance, this latter prefers to buy powerat 7:00 am, whilenR
þ1prefers to sell its surplus at 8:00 am. Hence,our goal is to ﬁnd the trade-off between the sellers and the buyerspreferences. The problem becomes more and more complicatedwhen each seller and buyer exchanges power with several compo-nents (since each can belong to several associations). For instance,nR
þ1belongs to another association as well, ( nRþ1;nR/C01), wherenR/C01
prefers also to buy power at 7:00 am. Hence, our module should pro-pose an optimal distribution of the sellers’ available power at eachtime t, in that it can meet its preferences and the buyers preferences,as well. Note that, for privacy reasons, a component has no priorinformation with whom he will exchange power, he can only precisethe quantity he needs to sell or buy at each time t.Before detailing the process, we present ﬁrst some deﬁnitionsused in our study. Each component nR,

It con-siders the sellers and buyers’ comfort (operational), the powerpeak load (operational), the electricity bills (economical) and theenvironmental impacts (ecological). Although it can be deﬁnedusing different aggregation functions (e.g., maximum, average,etc.), we adopted the weighted sum function to combine thedifferent objective aspects costs, allowing the user to tune theweight of each criterion.

An overview of the Preferences-based Compromise Buildermodule is shown inFig. 4consisting of three main components:(1) Candidate components’ prescheduling, (2) Final components’prescheduling, and (3) Compromise prescheduling. They aredetailed below.3.1.1. Candidate components’ preschedulingThe aim of this module is to dissociate the desired schedule ofeach seller/buyer, so as to distribute the power quantity at eachtime t (its capacity of selling/buying) between the componentswith which, it must exchange, without exceeding nor being inferiorto its desired capacity at time t. The pseudo-code of the candidatecomponents’ prescheduling is provided in Algorithm 2. Brieﬂy, for each seller/buyer, we retrieve the list of edges to which the seller/buyer belongs. Then, we generate the list of all the possible permu-tations of the retrieved edges (Lines 7–16). For each possible per-mutation list of edges at a time t, we verify if the seller/buyerhas enough power to sell/to buy to the buyer/from the seller ofthe same edge (Line 17). If there is enough power (Lines 18–20),we ﬁll the schedule with the quantity to buy/to sell and recall
Fig. 4.Preferences-based compromise builder framework.K. Salameh et al. / Applied Computing and Informatics 15 (2019) 67–79 73the process by the next seller/buyer. If not, we ﬁll the schedulewith the quantity to buy/sell, reduce the quantity to sell/buy, andverify the quantity to sell/buy to the next buyer/from the nextseller of the next edge (Lines 21–25).
3.1.2. Final components’ preschedulingThe aim of this module is to select the candidate components’schedules that guarantee that each edge is provided with itsexchanged value (EV) at each time t (e.g., at the end of the day,where t = 24 h). In other words, for each edge, the sum of thepower quantity exchanged between its sellers and the buyers atT, should be equal to their exchanged value ( EV) in thePG. So, the sellers sell all their power surplus and the buyers satisfy alltheir needs. The pseudo-code of the ﬁnal components’ schedulesis provided inAlgorithm 3. Brieﬂy, for each candidate schedule ofeach seller (Lines 2–9) and for each time t of the day, we calculatethe sum of the energy exchanged of the edges to which the seller/buyer belongs. The schedule is accepted if the sum is equal to theexchanged value of the edge (Lines 12–13). If the equality is veri-ﬁed for all the edges, we add the candidate schedule to the ﬁnalcomponents’ schedules (Lines 13–16).3.1.3. Compromise preschedulingThe aim of this module is to generate every seller-to-buyerassociation (edge) desired schedule. It consists of selecting the bestcombination between the ﬁnal preschedules of the sellers and buy-
ers. This can be done by selecting the combination that ensures theminimum gap between the desired schedules of the sellers andbuyers and the proposed compromise desired schedule. Thepseudo-code of the ﬁnal components’ schedules is provided inAlgorithm 4. First, we generate the combinations between the ﬁnalpreschedules of the sellers and the buyers (Lines 1–3). Then, foreach seller/buyer of each combination, we calculate the powerquantity for each edge in each candidate schedule for all combina-tions at a time t and ﬁll it into a new vector ( FinalQuantity) (Lines 4–17). After that, a similarity computation of the resulting vectorand the initial desired schedule (vector) of each seller/buyer isdone using the cosine similarity measure (Line 18). In fact, weadopted the commonly adopted cosine measure to calculate thedistance between the proposed and the desired schedule vectors(instead of many others such the Euclidean Distance, the PearsonCorrelation Coefﬁcient, etc.) since it provides better results whenAlgorithm 2.Candidate Components’ Prescheduling
Algorithm 3.Final Components’ Prescheduling74 K. Salameh et al. / Applied Computing and Informatics 15 (2019) 67–79there are many values in common between the two schedules tocompare. Finally, the combination vector having the biggest simi-larity or what we call it here ‘minimum delay’ will be retrieved(Lines 19–27).
3.1.4. Preference-based compromise builder illustrationIn our previous illustration, all the buyers and sellers are con-nected, forming one purchase graph (cf. Fig. 5), where the sellers are represented in red, the buyers in blue and the exchangedpower value is annotated on the gray arrow. For example, inFig. 5, there are 2 sellers (nR

This solution is the combination of the ﬁnal seller and buyerpreschedules that reduces the gap with the initial desired sched-ules of the sellers and buyers. Here, the Gap = 0 (the idealsolution).
3.2. Multi-objective SchedulerOnce done with the preferences-based combination generatorthat aims at extracting the desired schedules of the seller-to-buyer associations based on the sellers and buyers desired sched-ules given as input, it is time to schedule the resulting associationsin a way to minimize the operational, economical and ecologicalaspects. As deﬁned in Eq.(3), our objective function takes intoaccount: 1)- the operational aspect by considering the comfort ofthe sellers and buyers measured by the delay time between thedesired schedule and the real operation, the peak load reductionof the SG and the components calculated using the variance ofthe power at a time t 2)- the economical aspect is considered bymeasuring the electricity price at a time t, and 3)- the ecologicalaspect is treated by calculating the toxic gas emissions producedat a time t in the SG.In our work, we adopted Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), tosearch for the near-optimal scheduling for each seller-to-buyerassociation, because of its straightforward implementation anddemonstrated ability of optimization. In essence, PSO is a compu-tational method that optimizes a problem by iteratively trying toimprove a candidate solution with regard to a given measure ofquality using an objective function. It is considered as a powerfultool to solve complex non-linear and non-convex optimizationproblems. Moreover, it has several other advantages, such as fewerparameters to adjust, and easier to escape from local optimalsolutions.76 K. Salameh et al. / Applied Computing and Informatics 15 (2019) 67–79Brieﬂy, the problem is solved by having a population of candi-date solutions, here dubbed particles, and moving these particlesaround in the search-space according to simple mathematical for-mula over the particle’s position and velocity. Each particle’smovement is inﬂuenced by its local best known position, but is alsoguided toward the best-known positions in the search-space,which are updated as better positions are found by other particles.This is expected to move the swarm toward the best solutions.The pseudo-code of the adapted PSO is provided in Algorithm 5. The goal is to ﬁnd a solution a for which DisðaÞ<DisðbÞfor allb, which would mean thatais the global minimum. LetSbe the num- ber of particles in the swarm, each having a position x
iand a veloc- ity
vi. Letpibe the best known position of particle iand letgbe the best known position of the entire swarm. The values b
loandb upare respectively the lower and upper boundaries. The termination cri-terion can be number of iterations performed, or a solution withadequate objective function value is found. In our method, weset the parameters as in[19]to calibrate the PSO problem, usedfor mathematical models of Smart Homes.4. ExperimentsA set of experiments have been conducted to highlight the efﬁ-ciency of our approach as explained below.4.1. Experimental contextA prototype has been implemented using Java to conduct thetest on a PC with an Intel Core i7-3630 QM CPU, 2.40 GHz proces-sor with 8 GB RAM. Since the SG is relatively a recent concept inthe power systems area, there is a lack of a current Benchmarkto be based on. Hence, we carried out our experimental scenarioinspired by the one provided in[13]but adapted to ﬁt better the scope of our study. Here, we set up an SG within an area of 10km/C210 km with: 1) the main grid located at the onshore, and2) the SG components randomly located within this area. Thepower gap (G) of any SG componentnR:1 0 M W6GðnRÞ6316 MW. Note that, the power cost per kW is set to 11 :6 cents based on the US electricity prices
3and the conventional power generatorgas emissions is set to 0:26 kgCO2/kWh.
4The prototype includes the following functionalities: (1) the Preference-based compromisebuilder and the (2) Multi-objective scheduler.4.2. Experimental metrics and resultsThe main criteria used to evaluate the effectiveness of ourapproach are: (i) the preference-based compromise builder effec-tiveness, (ii) the time needed to generate the compromises, as wellas, (iii) the multi-objective scheduler impact on the electricity costreduction, the peak loads and the gas emissions.4.2.1. Preferences-based compromise builder effectivenessThe efﬁciency of the generated desired compromise schedule ismeasured by its similarity with the desired schedules of the sellersand the buyers given as an input. The similarity measure used inour module is the ‘Cosine Similarity Measure’, which results a sim-ilarity between 0 and 1 (from an absence of similarity ‘0’ to the big-gest similarity ‘1’).Fig. 6shows that the worst similarity ratioobtained is 0:72 and the best one is 0:95. This result reﬂects that our module ensures nice results providing an adequate compro-mise between the seller and the buyer preferences.4.2.2. Preferences-based compromise builder performanceIn addition to testing the effectiveness of our module in reduc-ing the gap between the proposed compromise desired scheduleand the desired sellers and buyers, we also evaluated its time per-formance. This test consisted of measuring the necessary time tobuild the compromise from the sellers and buyers associations(cf.Fig. 7), and showed a linear complexity of our algorithm.4.2.3. Multi-objective scheduler impact on the SGThe cooperation and the multi-objective aspects of the SG arethe key features of our scheduling. Hence, we measured the follow-ing resulting costs: the total electricity prices, the total toxic gasemissions, the components comfort, and the peak loads.Algorithm 5.Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm

4https://www.carte-grise.org/explication-calcul-bilan-co2.htm .K. Salameh et al. / Applied Computing and Informatics 15 (2019) 67–79 77In this test, two different scenarios were considered: (1) a non-cooperative scheduling, where each association is selﬁsh in that itonly considers its desired schedule, and (2) a cooperative schedul-ing based on our proposed multi-objective scheduling. To remaincoherent, we will consider the scheduling of the seller-to-buyerassociations of our same previous illustration. Note that, the out-put of the preference-based compromise builder will be used hereto calculate the comfort of the components by calculating the gapbetween the resulting schedule and the compromise desiredschedule.Fig. 8shows the electricity load resulting from the non-cooperative case. At T = 2, a peak load (Electricity load = 14 kW)appeared having several bad effects on the economical, ecologicaland the operational costs. From the economical perspective, thispeak load leads to a total electricity cost of 163 cents. From theecological perspective, and having at T = 2, a conventional powergenerator (emitting 0.26 kgCO2/kWh), the non-cooperationscheduling caused a simultaneous gas emissions of 3.64 kgCO2.The only advantage of this scheduling is that it answers exactlythe desired preferences of the components, which gives a similar-ity of 1 (the highest), between the proposed and the desiredschedules.Fig. 9shows the electricity load resulting from our multi-objective scheduler. It shows how the peak loads are shaved (High-est electricity load = 6 kW). The result is a trade-off between theeconomical, ecological and operational aspects. From the econom-ical perspective, the total electricity cost is reduced to 136 c. Fromthe ecological perspective, the highest simultaneous gas emissionsis reduced to 1.57 KgCO2. The only feature affected negatively isthe similarity between the desired and the proposed schedule,reduced to 0:75. Despite this reduction, the value remains a verygood result.5. ConclusionIn this paper, we proposedMOCSF, a Multi-Objective Coopera- tive Scheduling Framework providing a multi-type scheduling forthe power generation, storage and consumption, while taking intoaccount the ecological, economical and operational costs in apower system.MOCSFconsists of two main modules: thePreference-based Compromise Builder, providing the best balancebetween the desired schedulers of the sellers and the buyers givenas an input, and the Multi-objective Scheduler, providing seller-to-buyer associations scheduling aiming at ensuring the economical,ecological and operational satisfactions. Experiments resultsshowed the potential of our modules in providing efﬁcientpreference-based compromises able to reduce the gap with the ini-tial components preferences and in minimizing the three-dimensional costs. Currently, we are working on implementing aprivacy-by-design[9]grid control allowing to protect the compo-nents privacy whilst preserving the advanced control and monitor-ing functionalities of the power systems. Further, it is interesting toapply strategy-proof techniques, in order to avoid cheating in thedesired schedules,References
