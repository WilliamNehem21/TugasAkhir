Abstract 
In view of using only the intensity information of retrorefle ction wave and poor capacity of anti-interference in laser short-range detection, this paper analyzes the polarization characteristics of laser beam on the metal surface and establishes reflection model of polarized laser. A target de tection method based on polarization characteristics of reflection laser is putted forward and the simulation of polar ization characteristics on the surface of several typical metal targets is implemented at last.

1. Introduction Short-range detection with laser usually irradiates targ et by using laser beam and obtains target distance according to the intensity information of retroreflection wave. However, target and background objects usually intermix together in complex battlefield environment, and the laser reflected by background objects cause false alarm frequently when detecting target. Because of using only the intensity information of laser for detection, it is difficult for the detector to effectively distinguish betw een target and background objects, and

 the anti-interference capability of detection system is  low. As an important attribute of laser as well as intensity, frequency and coherent, polarization effectiv ely expand the laser detection information dimension and has attracted great attention widely in the world, an d research focus distributes in military target detection [1] [2] [3], remote sensing [4] [5], medical imaging [6] and other fields. Domestic research on laser polarization is also mainly focused on these fields and pa ys little attention to short-range detection, especially detection model, of ground objects. This paper mainly models and analyzes the laser polarization characteristic on the surface of metal target, and the simulation of polarization characteristics on the surface of several typical metal targets is also implemented. 2. The stokes polarization parameters Any polarization state of light, including completely po larized light, unpolarized light and partly polarized light, can be completely described by stokes parameters [ S
0;S1;S2;S3]. Because of monochromatic approximation for a plane wave, the Stokes parameter s of polarized laser are obtained from the formulas:

Polarization reflection characteristics of metal target The surface of metal target is quite smooth, and the echo consists mainly of low-order reflection component. Thus, this paper only considers polarization re flection characteristics, without considering higher- order scattering caused by rough surface. 3.1. Polarization reflection model of metal target Because of conductivity 
0, metal is lossy dielectric. Part of the electromagnetic energy is transformed to heat and consumed. Therefore, Fresnel
s equations for reflection becomes [8]

 3.2. Muller matrix description of reflection on metal surface According to the above analysis of reflection characteristics on metal surface, both the reflectivity and the phase of s and p components change in different degrees. In general, incident linear polarized laser beam becomes elliptically polarized on reflection from metal. According to the definition of stokes parameters, the changes of polarization on reflection from metal can be described by Muller matrix which can represent the process of reflection. Assuming that the Stokes vector of the incident light is
01 23[;; ; ]iiiiSSSS , and the Stokes vector of reflected light is
01 23[;;;]rrrrSSSS . The Muller matrix for reflection on metal surface can be derived by coordinating formulas (1) and (5).

Detection principle using polarization Due to the differences in object material, roughness of  surface, laser wavelength and incident angle, the polarization of reflected light changes in different degrees. By detecting the Stokes parameters of reflected light, the information of target can be extracted and the target can be detected from background objects.

Figure 2 Principle of short-range detection using polarization laser 
As shown in Figure 2, linearly polarized laser irradiates the surface of metal, and the detector receives the reflected light. The transmission axes of polarizer s and p are orthogonal. Therefore, the detectors s and p receive s and p components of reflected light respectively and output voltage signals. According to the signals, 332   Yu-ying Yang et al.  /  AASRI Procedia   3  ( 2012 )  328 – 334 
 the reflectivity of s and p components can be calculated and then different materials, including metal and nonmetal, will be distinguished.  4. Simulations for polarization reflection characterize of typical metal The formula (5), which represents the reflectivity an d the phase changes of reflected polarized light on the surface of metal, only has one variable 
1. As the 1 changes, the reflectivity and the phase on s and p direction also change. According to formula (5), the ref lectivity and angle changes of reflected light on copper, aluminum, iron, steel and water can be calculated, an d the related optical parameters are shown in table 1.

Figure 3 shows plots of reflectivity variations. When 1=0 or 1=90 the reflectivity on s and p directions of each material have the same value. Beca use of different materials, the initial values of these materials are not the same, and the initial reflectivity  of metal is obviously higher than the water
s. Meanwhile, initial values of these metals are not the same, and aluminum has the highest while iron has the lowest. All of the values of s component increase until unity with the incident angle increases, and the curve of water is the most violent in the five. As the incident angle increases, the values of p component decrease at first, and subsequently increase after some angle; the curve of water is also the most violent in the five.

 When the laser beam irradiates onto the surface of target, the energy is redistributed on the s and p directions. The energy of s and p components is different because of different materials, and the difference between s and p component is also not the same. As shown in figure 4(a), Y-axis is the value of R
s minus R p, and the differences increase with the incident angle in creases, and the order of differences from largest to smallest is iron, steel, cooper, aluminum and water. As sh own in figure 4(b), Y-axis is the ration between R
s and R
p, and the ratios of different materials become more  obvious with the incident angle increases. The maximum ratio of iron is nearly six times the size of the maximum ratio of aluminum.

5. Conclusions From the simulations for polarization reflection characteristics of different materials, two conclusions can be reached without considering the scattering components on the smooth surface of metal: 334   Yu-ying Yang et al.  /  AASRI Procedia   3  ( 2012 )  328 – 334 
 (1) The reflectivity and the phase on s and p directions will change and the degrees of changes are different because of materials when the polarized laser irradiates the surface of metal.   (2) From figures 3, 4, 5, the polarization reflectio n characterizes of magnetic metal, nonmagnetic metal and nonmetal can be used to distinguish the material of the object. Combined with the reflected light intensity information, the detector can be more effective to distinguish different objects. References [1] W G Egan, M J Duggin.
