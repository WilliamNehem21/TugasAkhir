One of the most promising approaches for complex technical systems analysis employs ensemble meth-ods of classiﬁcation. Ensemble methods enable a reliable decision rules construction for feature spaceclassiﬁcation in the presence of many possible states of the system. In this paper the novel techniquesbased on decision trees are used to evaluate power system reliability. In this work a hybrid approachbased on random forests models and boosting model is proposed. Such techniques can be applied to pre-dict the interaction of increasing renewable power, storage devices and intelligent switching of smartloads from intelligent domestic appliances, storage heaters and air-conditioning units and electric vehi-cles with grid to enhance decision making. This ensemble classiﬁcation method was tested on the mod-iﬁed 118-bus IEEE power system to examine whether the power system is secured under steady-stateoperating conditions./C2112017 The Authors.

1. IntroductionAssessment of security of bulk electric power systems isexpected to become an issue in modern power engineering dueto the continued growth in renewable energy generation and thefuture decentralization and electriﬁcation of heating, transportand smart domestic loads in the future smart grid. Trends towardsliberalization and the need to expand electricity transmission dueto increasing energy demand and generation expansion will resultin power grid operating electrical networks at critical conditions,close to admissible security limits[1–8].In such conditions unforeseen excess disturbances, weak con-nections, hidden defects of the relay protection system and auto-mated devices, human factors as well as a great amount of otherfactors can cause a drop in the system security or even the catas-trophic accidents.An analysis of methods for the assessment of security and volt-age stability of electric power system shows that the existing tra-ditional approaches cannot be effectively applied online and realtime conditions because of their computation complexity. Forexample, load ﬂow calculation for the assessment of the aftermathof a system component fault, which underlie the classical approachto the assessment of security in electric power systems does notseem to be fully implemented due to complex modeling of the cor-responding protections.Most energy management systems (EMS), for example Siemens,ABB, AREVA etc., use one or more security assessment predictorssuch as sensitivity matrix, security indicators, distribution factors,fast decoupled load ﬂows etc to reduce the computational effort ofthe security assessment. These analytical techniques are also usu-ally time consuming and therefore are not always suitable for real-time applications. Moreover, these methods can suffer from the

problem of misclassiﬁcation or/and false alarm, for example in thecase of ‘‘bad data” problem, cyberattacks, serious system topologychanges etc. Despite the EMSs wide development, the decisionmaking and onus is usually still with the expertise of the grid oper-ators. However, as the number of market participants, renewablepower sources, storage devices and smart loads increase in thepower system both at the transmission (and distribution) levelthe decision making will become ever more complex [9,10]. One of the effective solutions to this problem is the use of acombination of traditional approaches on the basis of securityindices and machine learning algorithms, such as artiﬁcial neuralnetworks (ANNs), support vector machine (SVM) and decisiontrees (DTs)[11–14,10]. The main idea here lies in an intelligentmodel learning to independently determine the current value ofan assumed indicator on the basis of input data, thus identifyingthe current state of power system. As studies by Wehenkel [15] and Diao[16]show such a modiﬁed approach makes it possibleto neutralize the drawbacks of traditional algorithmic approachesowing to the original properties of the machine learning technolo-gies[17].Among machine learning algorithms, some DT algorithms [18], especially those of the ‘‘white box” nature, have gained increasinginterest because not only do they provide the results of securityassessment but they also reveal the principles learned by DTs forsecurity assessment. These principles provide useful decision-making information required to make remedial action against rec-ognized insecure conditions. Moreover, ensemble methods basedon DT, such as random forest, boosting-based models, enable reli-able decision rules for feature space classiﬁcation in the presenceof many possible states of the power system. This researchemploys the ensemble methods based on DT. The calculationsinvolved modiﬁcations of bagging models (Random Forest, BaggedCART) and boosting models (Stochastic Gradient Boosting,AdaBoost).The paper is organized in 6 sections. Section 1introduces. Sec- tion2presents the problem statement of security assessment. Sec-tion3introduces the applications of ensemble DT-based learningfor the security assessment in power systems. Section 4describes database preparation with due considerations to power systemswith high penetration of wind power generation and other dis-tributed generation (DG). Section6demonstrates the feasibility of the ensemble DT-based approach using an IEEE 118 test powersystem. Section6concludes.2. Problem statementSecurity is the ability of an electric power system to withstandsudden disturbances without unforeseen effects on the consumers.It is provided by the control capabilities of power systems. Duringoperation the required level of security can be achieved by preven-tive control actions (before a disturbance) and emergency controlactions (after disturbance). Control in the pre-emergency conditionis mainly responsibility of the Operator in dispatch control. Natu-rally there can be situations where decision-making by the dis-patch personnel can be insufﬁcient to avoid dangerous situations.The complexity of the problem lies in the fact that most dangerous(pre-emergency) states of electric power system which lead tolarge-scale blackouts are unique and there is no single algorithm(for solving) to effectively reveal such conditions at the time. Theproblem gets complicated by the fact that the security limit of elec-tric power system constantly changes. Therefore fast methods forreal time security monitoring are required to analyze the currentlevel of security and accurately trace the limit and detect the mostvulnerable regions in a power system.The key idea of the ‘‘pre-emergency” control concept is that thevoltage instability following an emergency disturbance whichaccompanies many system emergencies does not develop as fastas the dynamic instability of the power system [6]. Thus, when aphase of slow emergency development occurs, the balancebetween generation and consumption is maintained for a longtime making it possible to detect potentially dangerous states,which appear after the disturbance in order to make the appropri-ate preventive control actions[1].To monitor if a power system is within its limit, primary mea-surement tools such as are SCADA systems and post processingby a state estimator as used[19]. The ENTSO-E
1network code on operational security requires each transmission system operator(TSO) to classify its system according to the system operating states[20].Fig. 1shows the different operating states of a power system asidentiﬁed by Liacco[21]and adopted in this work. Kundur et al. [22] describes power system stability concisely, details a precise methodof classiﬁcation and explains the real world implications to securityand reliability.
3. Ensemble learning for the security assessment in powersystems3.1. Ensembles methods of classiﬁcationsA great many studies show that the effective solution to thisproblem can be found on the basis of machine learning methodswhich normally include artiﬁcial neural networks, decision trees,ensemble (committee) models, etc. These studies are summarisedand discussed in Zhou et al.[23].The ability to solve the problem is related to the capability ofthe method to fast detect images, patterns (i.e. typical samples)and learning/generalization, which is important to identify insta-bility boundaries at high speed.One of the advanced approaches to analyze complex technicalsystems is ensemble methods of classiﬁcation. This method makesit possible to form reliable decision rules of classiﬁcation for a setof potential system states. In this approach the key idea is to builda universal classiﬁer of power system states, which is capable oftracing dangerous pre-emergency conditions and predicting emer-gency situations based on certain system security indices. In thiscase the detection of dangerous operation patterns is not effectivewithout considering probable disturbance/faults, whose calcula-tion lead to a considerable increase in the computational complex-ity and a potential decrease in the accuracy for basic algorithms.This leads to need to ﬁnd a way to improve the accuracy of theclassiﬁer of power system states. One of such methods is the cre-ation of ensembles of the classiﬁcation models and their training.One of the ﬁrst most general theory of algorithmic ensembleswas proposed in the algebraic approach by Zhuravlev [24]. Accord- ing to Zhuravlev[24]the composition ofNbasic algorithms h

This process was called boosting.Schapire[26]developed the ﬁrst provable polynomial-time boost-ing algorithm. It was intended to convert weak models into strongmodel by constructing an ensemble of classiﬁers. The main idea ofthe boosting algorithm is a step-by-step enhancement of the algo-

One of the popular implementations of this idea isSchapire’s AdaBoost algorithm, which involves an ensemble ofdecision trees[27].Another approach to the classiﬁcation and regression problemsusing the ensembles was suggested by Breiman [28]. This approach is an extension of the bagging idea. According to this idea, a collec-tive decision can be obtained by using an elementary committeemethod which classiﬁes an object according to a decision of mostof the algorithms. Unlike the boosting method bagging is basedon parallel learning of base classiﬁers. One of the progressivebagging-based approaches is the method called Random Forest[29]. Later there appeared the most effective modiﬁcations of bothRandom forests and boosting algorithms such as Extremely Ran-domized Trees[30], Oblique Random Forests[31]and Stochastic Gradient Boosting[32].In the studies on security assessment there are manyapproaches oriented to the construction of models on the basisof decision trees. These studies are described by Panasetsky et al.[1]. These models use both off-line (periodically updated) andon-line methods. Single trees are easily interpretable, yet do notalways result in the required accuracy when approximating com-plex target relationships. Therefore, it is considered reasonable touse compositions.3.2. Applications in power system security assessmentSeveral applications involving ensemble DTs have beenaddressed in real-time transient stability prediction and assess-ment, voltage security monitoring and estimation, loss of synchro-nism detection and timing of controlled separation in powersystems[15,16,18,33]. A recent approach has combined DT withanother data mining tool for prediction performance improvementin the ﬁeld of dynamic security controls [34]. Vittal et al.[16]pre- sented an online voltage security assessment scheme using PMUsand periodically updated DTs. The proposed tree-based modelare trained ofﬂine using detailed voltage security analysis con-ducted and updated every hour by including newly predicted sys-tem conditions for robustness improvement. Sadeghi et al. [13] proposed the AdaBoost algorithm as a new approach in securityassessment by classifying pre-fault data of power system. The mainbeneﬁts of using AdaBoost are a higher accuracy compared to othermachine learning approaches and the ability to display effects ofdifferent features in the security assessment problem.Liu et al.[35]proposed a random forest-based approach foronline power system security assessment. The results are showedhigh accuracy in the presence of variance and uncertainties dueto wind power generation and other dispersed generation units.The performance of this approach was demonstrated on the oper-ational model of western Danish power system with the scale ofaround 200 lines and 400 buses. Kamwa et al. [36]demonstrated the effectiveness of the random forest-based approach in a PMUpredictive assessment of catastrophic power system events. Todemonstrate the greatest generalization capability of the method-ology, a single Random Forest is shown to have a 99.9% reliabilityon a large data set containing a mix of 90% instances from theHydro-Quebec grid and 10% instances from a nine-area testsystem.3.3. The problem of conﬁrmation biasOptimizing a machine learning-based model for security assess-ment often requires experimentation and tuning. Often, research-ers compare their own favorite algorithm, for which they arepresumably expert, with a set of ‘‘competing” methods, which theydiscover while doing the comparative study. For this reason, thecompared algorithms often represent the state of the art only forthe favorite method, and under such conditions highly biased con-clusions may be reached. The analysis of many studies showed thatwe could not suggest that one particular kind of predictive modelwould be more appropriate than others [37].Fig. 1.Operating states and transitions.A. Zhukov et al. / Applied Computing and Informatics 15 (2019) 45–53 47Since the best security model depends on the problem and thedata, the engineer must search a very large set of feasible optionsto ﬁnd the best model. In operational dispatch management, how-ever, the time is strictly limited. Strict time constraints do not per-mit much time for experimentation. Researchers tend to deal withthis problem by settling for sub-optimal models, arguing thatobtained models need only be ‘‘good enough,” or defending useof one technique above all others. As power grids grow more com-plex, realizations of power system parameters more quickly chang-ing, these tactics become ineffective.The key to overcoming these challenges is to use automatedmodeling techniques. To ﬁnd the best security assessment model,we need to be able to search across techniques and to tune param-eters within techniques. Potentially, this can mean a massive num-ber of model train-and-test cycles to run; we can use heuristics tolimit the scope of techniques to be evaluated based on characteris-tics of the response measure and the predictors.Therefore, we started from the premise that almost everymethod (model) may be useful within some restricted context,and summarize the respective strengths and limitations of the var-ious methods so as to highlight their complementary possibilities.Therefore, the power system security assessment tool was devel-oped based on the multi-model machine learning-based approach.In the paper, we propose an automated security assessment tech-nique in order to predict alarm states in power systems based onthe caret package in open source R.4. An automated ensemble DT-based technique for securityassessmentEnsemble methods enable a reliable decision rules for featurespace classiﬁcation in the presence of many possible states of thesystem to be build. In this paper, an automated technique basedon ensemble DTs learning is proposed for online power systemsecurity assessment (Fig. 2).4.1. Test patternSpeciﬁcally, ensemble DT models are ﬁrst trained off-line usingthe cross-validation. For each candidate tuning parameter combi-nation, an ensemble DT model is ﬁt to each resampled data setand is used to predict the corresponding held out samples. Theresampling performance is estimated by aggregating the resultsof each hold-out sample set. Resampling methods try to inject vari-ation into the system to approximate the model’s performance onfuture samples. These performance estimates are used to evaluate,which combination(s) of the tuning parameters are appropriate.Once the ﬁnal tuning values are assigned, the ﬁnal model is reﬁtusing the entire training set. The ‘‘optimal” model from eachensemble DT technique is selected to be the candidate model withthe largest accuracy or the lowest misclassiﬁcation cost.The primary principle of the approach lies in the ensemble DTmethod of classiﬁcation to automatically make a sufﬁciently accu-rate assessment of the power system conditions according to thecriterion secure/insecure based on the signiﬁcant classiﬁcationattributes of a power system state, for example active and reactivepower ﬂows, bus voltage, etc. A great amount of such attributes areobtained from randomly generated data samples consisting of a setof really possible states of the electric power system. Depending onthe ensemble method applied each decision rule will be trained byits subsampling according to the bagging and boosting principles.The ﬁnal decision on the classiﬁcation of any power system stateis made by the generalized classiﬁer according to different princi-ples of simple majority voting, weighted voting or by choosing themost competent decision rule (seeFig. 3).4.2. The Use of L-index in the problem of security assessmentIn this study L-index is used because it is one of the effectiveindices from this group, as a target indicator of system stabilitywhen training an ensemble DT model. The L-index is proposedby Kessel and Glavitsch in[38]as an indicator of impeding voltagestability. Starting from the subsequent analysis of a power lineequivalent model, a voltage stability index based on the solutionto power ﬂow equations is developed. The L-index is a quantitativemeasure for the estimation of the distance of the actual state of thesystem to the stability limit. The L-index describes the stability ofthe entire system with the expression:
L¼max
j2aLLj/C0/C1 ð1Þ
where aLis a set of load nodes.L jis a local indicator that determinesthe buses which can be sources of collapse. The L-index varies in arange between 0 (no load) and 1 (voltage collapse) and is used toprovide meaningful voltage instability information during thedynamic disturbances in the system.
Kessel and Glavitsch reformulate the local indicator L jin terms of the power as:
L¼1þ_U0j

Evaluating the L-index as given by(2)each pattern is labeled as belonging to one of the four classes shown in Table 1. The obtained labeling of L-index is based on modeling of manytest power systems schemes with expert evaluation differentobtained states as normal, dangerous and emergency conditions.The criteria for the system states are brieﬂy described as follows:/C15Normal state implies that all parameters of the power systemare maintained within speciﬁed normal operation limits./C15Alarm state implies that some of the system parameters exceedthe speciﬁed normal limits (for example, bus voltage can exceed5%, but remain within 10%). Depending on the operation rules,actions can take place to bring the system to the normal state./C15Emergency correctable state implies the system is still intact.However, some system constraints are violated. The systemcan be restored to the normal state (or at least to the alarmstate), if suitable corrective actions are taken./C15Emergency non-correctable state implies that the current situa-tion cannot be corrected and will lead to major emergency. Con-trol actions, like load shedding or controlled system separationare used for saving as much of the system as possible from awidespread blackout.The performance indices can communicate contingency sever-ity and thus the power system security degree by means of indica-tive colors[39]. These need to be carefully selected in order todeliver a suggestive message; if remedial actions are needed, forexample. As illustrated inFig. 4smoothly changing color scale issuitable for that purpose. In this way, the reporting is simple butindicative, suggesting the alarm level and the expected magnitudeof remedial actions for improvement of the condition.

Case studyThe feasibility of this approach in a proof-of-concept has beendemonstrated on the IEEE 118 power system consisting of morethan 118 buses, 54 generators, and 186 transmission lines.
2The base load of this system is about 4242 MW and 1438 MVar. Anopen-source environment R[40]withcaretpackage[41]is used as the computing environment for the proposed models’ designand testing.
5.1. Data base generationIn the analysis a list of potential power system states for themodel learning is formed using quasi-dynamic modeling with aspecial program in the MATLAB environment (Power System Anal-ysis Toolkit)[42]. The load model was represented by static char-acteristics depending on voltage. When critical values of voltageare achieved the load is automatically transferred to shunts. Themethod of a proportional increase in load at all nodes of the testsystem was optimized for the security analysis in such a way thatthe initial condition for each emergency disturbance is a stablecondition closest to it, from those calculated. Thus, at each stageof an increase in the test scheme load the emergency events (pri-mary disturbances) are randomly modeled by the N/C01 reliability principle. The disturbances included losses of generation and con-nection of a large consumer at speciﬁed nodes. As a result, thedatabase including a set of various pre-emergency and emergencystates of the test scheme is built.The database contains not only the data as predictor values, butalso the target values. A set of the obtained system states was usedto calculate the values of global L-index, and on the basis of localindicesL
j. As result, we computed the attribute values and pre-classiﬁed based on the L-index the obtained states as ‘‘normal”,‘‘alarm”, ‘‘emergency correctable” and ‘‘emergency non-correctable”. These characteristics were applied as class marksfor training and testing the models.5.2. Estimating performance for classiﬁcationIn this analysis proper performance measurement metrics forclassiﬁcation problems are used. The following metrics are used:/C15The overall accuracy of a model indicates how well the modelpredicts the actual data./C15The Kappa statistick, takes into account the expected error rate:k¼O/C0E1/C0E ð3Þ
whereOis the observed accuracy andEis the expected accuracy under chance agreement.
5.3. Ensemble DT training and performanceAll 3000 cases in the created database were treated equally and1000 cases (33%) are randomly selected to form a test set. Theremaining 2000 ones (66%) were used to form the learning set.Namely, the following DT-based techniques were tested: boostingmodels - Stochastic Gradient Boosting (SGB), AdaBoost (AB) andbagging models - Random Forest (RF),
3and Bagged CART.4DT mod- els were trained using the cross-validation. For comparison purposeswith other learning techniques, such as Extreme Learning Machine(MLP), Support Vector Machine (SVM), were also trained and testedusing the same approach.
As already discussed, the ‘‘optimal” model from each techniqueis selected to be the candidate model with the largest accuracy. Ifmore than one tuning parameter is ‘‘optimal” then the functionwill try to choose the combination that corresponds to the leastcomplex model. For example, for the Random Forest, mtrywas esti- mated to be 124 andnumRandomCuts= 1 appears to be optimal (Fig. 5).Fig. 5.The relationship between the number of Random Forest technique components and the resampled estimate of the area under the cross-validation.

Zhukov et al. / Applied Computing and Informatics 15 (2019) 45–53Table 2shows comparison of accuracy achieved by the classiﬁ-cation learning techniques. FromTable 2, the comparison indicates that ensemble models produce more accuracy than the simpleones. For this case study, Random Forest and AdaBoost modelsare the ‘‘best” performance techniques to detect dangerous statesin the IEEE 118 test system.Compared with single DT, an ensemble DT model has theadvantage that it gives each variable the chance to appear in a dif-ferent context with different covariates, so as to better reﬂect itspotential effect on the response. The importance of variables inensemble modeling is computed to assess the contribution of thevariables to grow the ensemble model and the relevance of eachvariable over all DTs in the ensemble model [35].Fig. 6shows the relative variable importance.5.4. Ensemble DT performance in the case of ‘‘Corrupted ”dataFor comparison purposes the following computational experi-ments were carried out to compare the traditional and intelligentapproaches.

Zhukov et al. / Applied Computing and Informatics 15 (2019) 45–53 51states database were generated using quasi-dynamic modeling. All3000 cases in the created database are treated equally and 1000cases (33%) were randomly selected to form a test set. However,the data of a test set were distorted such as 1% of the data wasreplaced by uniformly distributed random values lying withinthe limits of the changes of each particular system variables. Suchdistortions can be caused by a number of reasons, including thepresence of ‘‘bad data” in telemetry information, cyberattacks,etc. Based on a learning set, approximations of the L-index wereconstructed using several machine learning methods, includingensemble DT models. Machine learning models were trained usingcross-validation. After the trained models were tested using a ‘‘cor-rupted” test set to determine the value of the L-index. For clarity,the problem of regression recovery was solved.As can be seen fromFig. 7, the traditional algorithmic approachbased on the direct calculation of the L-index (according the orig-inal approach of Kessel and Glavitsch proposed in [38]) leads to a signiﬁcant distortion of the assessment. At the same time, asshown inTable 3, all tested intelligent methods show high accu-racy. The Random Forest method shows the best result.The feasibility of dealing with missing data was also tested. Tak-ing into consideration SCADA malfunctions the corrupted patternswere used to train ensemble classiﬁcation trees. The resultsshowed that the test error rate did not changed even with 50% gaps(Table 4).These test results clearly show faster, better ﬁtting and moreefﬁcient results if the test system model is adapted and updatedperiodically with new cases rather than using ofﬂine cases as usedin Beiraghi and Ranjbar[43]and Diao et al.[16]. The database can be periodically updated by the new cases together with the exist-ing cases. Finally, a stronger ensemble model can be created imme-diately with strengthened information of the updated database.This theoretically means that not alone is less computational timerequired to identify a feasible solution but a better optimal solu-tion is also achieved enabling the TSO to respond better to powersystem instability.6. ConclusionThe ensemble classiﬁcation methods were tested on the modi-ﬁed IEEE 118 power system showing that proposed technique canbe employed to examine whether the power system is securedunder steady-state operating conditions. The experimental studiesshowed that the ensemble methods can identify key systemparameters as security indicators with high accuracy and, ifrequired, the obtained security tree-based model can produce analarm for triggering emergency control system. Hypothetically,this outlier identiﬁcation ensemble method is able to improvethe accuracy of power system security assessment to even 100%.However, even in the case of retraining, the complete training ofthe ensemble DT model is associated with additional time, whichexcludes the retraining in real time. The next stage of this workwill involve development of an on-line ensemble DT method,which updates the existing model, using new data without its totalrestructuring.A potential security ensemble a DT based system can operate intwo modes for control the power system states: (1) automatic con-trol (closed loop) which automatically produces the optimal con-trol actions (for example, control the reactive power sources)when interacting with local automation (automatic undervoltageprotection, multi-agent automation, etc.) without checking theoperator’s actions and (2) advisor dispatcher (open loop) whichgenerates control actions that can then be implemented by the dis-patcher (for example, change the protective relay settings bydecreasing the settings with respect to time, increasing sensitivityof startup signals of the emergency control functions through theselection of an appropriate group of settings, etc.). Overall thisensemble DT based system approach shows potential real worldopportunities to enhance and optimize TSO power system stabilitycapabilities. Such an approach will be invaluable in a future powersystem with increasing numbers of market participants, renewablepower sources, storage devices and smart loads both at the trans-mission (and distribution) level.AcknowledgementsThis work is partly supported by the International science andtechnology cooperation program of China and Russia, project2015DFR70850 and by the National Natural Science Foundationof China Grant No. 61673398.References
