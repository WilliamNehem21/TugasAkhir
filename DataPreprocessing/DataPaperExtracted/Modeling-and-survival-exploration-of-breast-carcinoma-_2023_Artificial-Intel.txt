Maximum likelihood estimation ABSTRACT  
The core objective of this research is to describe the behavior of the distribution using the MLE method to es-
timate its parameters, as well as to determine the optimal Artificial Neural Network method by comparing it to 
the maximum likelihood estimation method and applying it to real data for breast cancer patients to determine 
survival, risk, and other survival study functions of the log-logistic distribution. The parameters were defined in 
the input layer of the artificial neural network developed for the purpose of survival analysis and reliability 
function, hazard rate function, probability density function, reserved hazard rate function, Mills ratio, Odd 
function and CHR values were obtained in the output layer. The findings show that risk function increases with 
the increase in the time of infection and then decreases for a group of breast cancer patients under study, which 
corresponds to the theoretical properties of this according to the practical conclusions. The examination of 
survival analysis reveals that practical conclusions correspond to the theoretical properties of log-logistic dis-
tribution. Artificial neural networks have proven to be one of the ideal tools that can be used to predict various 
vital parameters, especially survival of cancer patients, with their high predictive capabilities.   
1.Introduction 
Any carcinoma that develops in our bodies is inherently harmful. If it 
occurs, we must endeavor to detect it and expel it as soon as possible. 
Breast carcinoma is an extremely frequent carcinoma in women of all 
races and ethnicities, and it is the second leading root of carcinoma- 
related death in Asian Pacific Islander, American-Indian Native 
women [1,2]. It is a carcinoma that begins in the tissues of the breast and 
spreads uncontrollably to other regions of the body, resulting in death. 
There are some occurrences of breast carcinoma in men, although they 
account for less than 0.05 percent of all occurrences symptomatic [3]. 
Breast carcinoma is grouped into two categories. The ducts that carry 
milk from the breast to the nipple are where ductal carcinoma begins. 
This is the most frequent types of breast carcinoma. Lobular cancer 
develops in the milk-producing lobules of the breast [4–6]. Bust carcinoma can start in other parts of the breast in extremely uncommon 
circumstances. The three most significant things we can perform to 
discover a potentially malignant deepen in the breast are frequent 
mammography, annual clinical breast checks with your health practi -
tioner, and monthly bust inspections [7]. 
Artificial intelligence tools, including artificial neural networks 
(ANN), have been used frequently in the projection of many health data, 
including oncological conditions [8–10]. There are some publications on 
the practice of ANNs that can predict data according to traditional sta-
tistical methods and mathematical tools. Ambrogi et al. [11] focused on 
the research of precise hazard functions of survival data as a statistical 
analysis. In the study, a multilayer perceptron is recommended as an 
addition of GLMs (generalized linear models) with multinomial errors 
using a nonlinear estimator within the structure of discrete-time distri -
butions and competing risks. As per standard practice, weight reduction

2is adopted to modulate model complexity. For complexity control, a 
Genetic Algorithm is taken into account that allows each parameter of 
the model to be regulated independently. To exemplify the importance 
and strengths of the methodology, an implementation is presented on 
analyses of 1793 women with primary breast cancer without axillary 
lymph node involvement. Shafiq et al. [12] used two separate tech-
niques, ANN modelling and maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), to 
establish a real application to estimate COVID-19 mortality rates in 
Italy. The numerical findings were compared to the predictions derived 
from the ANN model formed with 9 neurons in the hidden layer. The R 
value for ANN model was 0.99836, and the greatest deviance was 
-0.14%. The findings of the investigation showed the great reliability of 
the two statistical models constructed. Bhambhvani et al. [13] examined 
the predictability of survival with machine learning in bladder cancer 
patients. In the research, the performance of ANN, a kind of machine 
learning algorithm, was evaluated with the performance of multivariate Cox proportional hazards models in predicting 5-year genetic disorder 
survival and overall longevity. ANNs were trained and tested by dividing 
the dataset in a ratio of 80/20. Considering the inherent constraints of 
administrative datasets, machine learning can help to analyze the 
complex data they contain more effectively. As a result, it has been seen 
that machine learning algorithms can be a tool that can be used in 
improving the capacity to forecast the prognosis of breast carcinoma. 
The log-logistic (LL) distribution is a significant right-skewed model 
that has piqued the researchers ’ interest [14]. It is employed as a sur-
vival study parametric model. The LL distribution, unlike the more often 
employed Weibull model, can have a non-monotonic hazard function 
forξF1, where ξ is the shape indicator. Furthermore, forξ≼1, the LL 
distribution ’s hazard function is unimodal and monotonically declining 
[15,16]. Some other feature of the LL distribution is that the model ’s 
function may be stated in explicit form, which is helpful in censored 
survival analysis. Further literature on the LL distribution ’s applications

3can be found in [17,18]. The LL distribution has been investigated by 
many scientists. The order statistics of the LL distribution were studied 
by [14]. Ali and Khan [19] developed recurrence equations for the LL 
distributions ’ moments of order statistics. 
Because of its widespread application in biosciences and pharma -
cological studies, research in the domain of survival analysis has 
exploded in recent years. One goal of this research is to investigate the 
effectiveness of competing survival function estimators after selecting 
the probability density function (PDF) that perfectly describes the sur-
vival times of breast carcinoma women. The current study will employ 
the LL distribution to model survival data. Based on our careful review of 
abovementioned studies, we believe that no investigation has been 
conducted on metric analysis of the probability survival model via MLE 
and artificial ANN. Hence, the fundamental goal of this research is to 
investigate, optimize and predict lifetime model dependability using 
two different methodologies, ANN modelling and MLE. This research 
attempts to fill a significant gap in the existing literature. 
We devoted a lot of time and exertion into this investigation in order to make a fair comparison by integrating two techniques to model sur-
vival/failure times for breast cancer patients entry to the center until 
discharge was recorded, and that all of them were in a state of death 
upon discharge at Medical City Hospital - Baghdad for the year 2020 
using LL distribution and enhancing it utilizing ANN modeling and MLE 
likewise. 
This study is planned in accordance with current trends.  
(i) The main goal of this research is to forecast and assess the 
dependability characteristics of LL distribution employing a set of 
inputs in all ANN models that has never been studied and 
addressed previously. 
(ii)To develop ANN-based models for forecasting the LL distribu -
tion’s appealing closed-form features.  
(iii) Determine whether ANN models are ideal for assessing and 
forecasting features of real-world facts using the LL distribution.  
(iv) To assess results using two techniques.

Because of its flexibility and ability to imitate skewed data as shown 
in Fig. 1(a-f), the LL distribution is frequently employed in disciplines 
such as biological studies, dependability, physical infrastructure, and 
survival analysis. 
In fields like as medicine biology, social sciences, econometrics, and 
engineering, survival analysis is now widely used [20]. Whenever it 
concerns to events that can happen over a long period of time (years), 
the time of occurrence becomes critical information, and the field that 
investigates its model is known as survival evaluation [17,21]. The 
period between a certain starting point (birth, commencement of 
treatment) and a "terminal" event (death, treatment failure), where 
"terminal" denotes that following events are not taken into account even 
if they could theoretically occur (i.e., recurrent failures), is referred to as 
survival time (T). The survival function (SF) is the fundamental quantity 
for defining survival time T (nonnegative continuous r.v) in this sce-
nario. It is described as the likelihood of surviving at t:StPrTFt

are given. Where, lifespan r.v T represents an individual ’s longevity. The SF St†ξCβof LL distribution is.

It’s a monotonic decreasing function that assumes value one for t0 
and ends at 0 as time approaches infinity. Fig. 2 illustrates graphs of the 
LL distribution ’s survival function for various parameter values. Under 
the considered parametric parameters, this displays monotonic non- 
increasing behavior. In Fig. 3, the 3D behavior of both 
ftandStfunctions is shown. 
The hazard rate is a measurement of an item ’s inclination to fail or 
perish based on its age. It is a subcategory of the larger field of statistics 
known as survival analysis. It’s utilized to model a person ’s odds of 
dying as a function of age, and it’s also utilized to model the periods with 
the largest and smallest possibilities of an occurrence. It can also be used 
to simulate any other variable that changes over time [22]. Let T r.v 
represents the survival time, which is nothing but the time-to-event, 
then generally h (t), is mathematically characterized as:

STtBThe results from (3) to (4) demonstrate that the hazard rate and 
survival functions provide alternative but related descriptions of the T 
distribution. These are some of the reasons why using the hazard rate 
function instead of other techniques for presenting survival studies 
might be a beneficial suggestion:  
≡It is informative to evaluate the risk associated with an entity that is 
surviving at age t.  
≡effective for comparing groups of individuals,  
≡When there is censoring or diversity of failures, this is quite useful.

mon in real-time applications.

This result of estimation is used in evaluation of survival analysis of 
LL distribution and has been authenticated and compared with ANN 
prediction discussed in Section 4. 4.Basic equations and foundation of the ANN model design 
Seven distinct parameters were estimated using a multilayer per-
ceptron (MLP) ANN model. In the MLP network model ’s input layer, that 
is one of the most extensively employed ANN models, t, ξ and β values 
are defined and RF, HRF, PDF, RHRF, Mills, OF and CHR parameters are 
obtained in the output layer [25–27]. Since there is no mechanism for 
detecting neurons in MLP networks ’ deep layer, the performances of 
ANNs formed with various neuron counts were assessed and the hidden 
layer model with 9 neurons was explored [26,28,29 ]. The symbolic 
framework and fundamental configuration of the adapted ANN model 
are shown in Fig. 10. The 34 of data points are reserved for training, 8 for 
confirmation, and 8 for testing in ANN model, which utilizes a number of 
50 data [30–32]. Levenberg-Marquardt training algorithm, that has a 
strong learning structure, was employed as the training algorithm 
[33–35]. The Tan-Sig and PFs (Purelin functions) used as transfer 
functions are [25,36]:

5.Numerical approach and ANN validation 
In this section, we look at how LL distribution has been implemented 
on data obtained from 50 breast cancer patients at Medical City Hospital 
in Baghdad in the year 2020. As of the time of the patient ’s admission to 
the hospital till discharge, and as of the time of their release, all of them 
were dead; this data is regarded complete data. The distribution of data 
is LL.The more detail about the data can be seen in [40]. They had used 
Anderson –Darling, Chi-squared, and Kolmogorov –Smirnov statistic as 
model fitting requirement; and the LL model fits all of the requirements 
for a greater goodness fit model, according to the findings of this study. 
The following are the findings of their investigation into the MLEs of 
parameters for this data: β⌢
3B2795and ξ⌢
4B8896BHistograms and 
box plots are both employed to investigate and display data in a simple 
and concise way. Since histograms are more effective in displaying data 
distribution, a box plot can be helpful to determine whether the distri -
bution is symmetric or skewed. Fig. 11 exhibits histogram and boxplot 
plots, demonstrating that the distribution is right-skewed. Using these 
results, we were able to analyze the effects of MLEs of key parameters on 
the FF, RF, HRF, RHRF, MR, OF and CHRF for cancer patients ’ survival 
periods and forecast these outcomes applying an ANN framework. The 
accuracy of the outcome was determined by calculating these scores for the survival measures of interests for the β⌢
3B2795and ξ⌢
4B8896B
Fig. 12 depicts the behavior of survival function indicators for cancer 
patients ’ survival periods using the MLE technique and ANN prediction. 
The both results have been authenticated and compared through 
graphically. It is seen that graphs are almost identical under both 
methods. We notice from Fig. 12, that the survival function, Mills ratio 
and RHRF appeared decreasing, and the risk function appeared upside 
down bathtub shaped, and this corresponds to the theory of the func-
tions. Whereas. In this line, an increment of survival time causes the 
boost in the profile of odd function and CHRF, as indicated in Fig. 12. 
This corresponds to the theory of the functions discussed in Section 3. 
These have been demonstrated to be in excellent accordance when 
compared to the ANN model and we obtained an excellent confirmation 
of the results as shown in Fig 12. As a conclusion, the current study can 
be used to analyze survival study issues with confidence. 
6.Results and discussion 
Before examining the accuracy of the prediction of the ANN model, it 
is pivotal to verify that the training phase is preferably finished. Fig. 13 
provides the training performance of the MLP network. Although MSE 
estimates are large in the early phases of the MLP network, MSE values 
drop with each successive epoch. The decrease in MSE values shows that 
the error between the predicted scores and the target outcomes obtained 
in output layer also decreases. By the 15th epoch, the smallest error value 
was acquired and the training stage of model was terminated by 
achieving the highest training performance. This indicates that the 
training phase of the MLP architecture was finished with a very low 
error rate. Fig. 14 predicts error histogram of ANN model. In the error 
histograms, the training performance of the model is analyzed by 
showing the differences across the predicted scores and the target scores. 
When the results in the error histogram are scrutinized, it is noticed that 
the values obtained of the errors are really near to zero and are 
extremely low. It’s also worth mentioning that the errors are concen -
trated near the zero error line. The results obtained from the error his-
togram show that the errors for the training phase of the ANN model are 
very low and the training phase of the model is completed ideally. The 
ANN model ’s R score was found to be 0.99958. And this is another 
indication of the ideal completion of the training phase of the model. In 
Fig. 15, for each of the 7 output values, the agreement of the target 
values with the predicted values is examined. When the values shown 
for each of the 50 data used in the development of the ANN model are 
examined, it is seen that the predicted values obtained from the ANN 
model are in perfect agreement with the target values. Fig. 16 shows the 
MoD values calculated for each data point. When the values calculated 
to analyze the prediction errors of the ANN model are analyzed, it is seen 
that the MoD values for 50 data points are generally on or very close to 
the zero deviation line. It should be noted that the average MoD quan-
tities provided for each output are also quite low. Results gleaned from 
the calculated MoD quantities show that ANN model can calculate 7 
output values with very low deviation values. Another error analysis was 
made in Fig. 17, where the disparities in target values and ANN outputs 
were scrutinized. The low difference values are considered as another 
proof that the ANN model can make forecasts with very small errors. In 
Fig. 18, on the x and y axes, the target and output values are displayed, 
respectively. It’s worth noting that the positions of the data points are on 
the zero error line and are in ±10% error band. The study found that the 
designed ANN model is capable of accurately predicting each output 
value with very minimal errors. 
7.Conclusions 
In this research work, comparative examination of the MLE method 
and ANN modeling has been scrutinized using LL distribution. This 
innovative model has been applied in a survival-based examination of

Shafiq et al.

10cancer patients ’ remission periods and survival times. In recent decades, 
several attempts have been undertaken to combat cancer by combining 
modern technologies with traditional methods. As general non-linear 
models, artificial neural networks have been demonstrated to be effective in medical diagnosis, forecasting, and survival analysis. 
The important findings are noted as follows:

11≡Through the results of the ANN experiments, survival characteristics 
of LL distribution like survival/reliability, risk, and others functions 
can be predicted more precisely.  
≡It has been revealed that both strategies exhibit the same pattern as 
the time increases.  
≡The values of the risk function increase with the increase in the time 
of infection and then decrease for a group of breast cancer patients 
under study, which corresponds to the theoretical properties of this 
function as it is an upside down bathtub shaped function, according 
to the practical conclusions.  
≡The values of the survival function appeared decreasing as the values 
of (t) increased, and this corresponds to the theory of the SF.  ≡As survival time ‘t’ rose, the values of the survival function seemed to 
be diminishing, this is consistent with the survival function theory.  
≡The probability density function ’s results gradually increased before 
declining.  
≡The R value for the developed ANN model was calculated as 0.99958.  
≡The MoD value assessed for each of the 7 out-turns parameters 
estimated by the ANN model was very low.  
≡The findings of the investigation of performance parameters revealed 
that ANNs are an excellent technique that can be used in the analysis 
of survival of cancer patients.
