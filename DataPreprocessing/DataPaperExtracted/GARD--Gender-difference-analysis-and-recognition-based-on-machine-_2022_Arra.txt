In recent years, intelligent diagnosis and intelligent medical treatment based on big data of medical examina-
tions have become the main trend of medical development in the future. In this paper, we propose a method
for analyzing the difference between males and females in medical examination items (medical attributes) and
find that males and females of different ages have differences in medical attributes. Then, the cluster analysis
method is used to further analyze the differences between male and female in medical examination items,
such that some common important attributes (CIAs) that can be used for gender recognition are found within
a specific age range. Following, we propose two gender recognition models (GRMs) by using the found CIAs
to identify the gender. A large number of experimental results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the
proposed GRMs. Experimental results show that the medical attributes with a large value of difference really
contribute to gender recognition. Within a certain age range, such as 17 to 51 years old, the proposed GRM
can reach 92.8% accuracy using only six medical attributes.
1. Introduction
With the rapid development of computer technology and hospital
information systems, electronic medical record (EMR) has been pop-
ularized to replace the traditional handwritten medical records [ 1].
Furthermore, the establishment of an advanced EMR system will bring
the hospital into a new era of digital hospitals and provide proactive,
convenient, and efficient data services for the hospital’s medical, scien-
tific research and teaching as well as hospital management. However,
during collecting the EMR data, the values of some medical examina-
tion items cannot be avoided to lose, such as the value of gender. For
EHR analysis, patient ender information plays a very essential role in
referring some useful information, and the lack of this information will
affect the data quality of EMR. However, in some Chinese EHRs, gender
information is either missing [ 2], or it is hidden and deleted due to

miss value algorithm with the non-missing value of medical data, and
predict gender from data that does not involve privacy risks.
It is well-known that accurate analysis of medical examination
data, which depends on data integrity, is conducive to early disease
detection, patient care, and community service. However, the incom-
pleteness of medical examination data will reduce the analysis accu-
racy. Yoon et al. proposed a generative adversarial imputation network
(GAIN) for imputing missing data by adopting the well-known gener-
ative adversarial network (GAN) framework [ 4]. Yang et al. pointed
out that GAIN is not suitable for analyzing medical examination data,
because GAN itself adapts to pixel data, so they combined fuzzy coding
to adjust the GAIN [ 5]. As most of the medical examination data
in the intensive care unit are time series, Luo et al. combined GAN

with the gated recurrent unit to construct the gated recurrent unit
for data imputation for filling missing values in time series data [6].
Similarly, the time dimension information is used to fill missing values
by multidirectional recurrent neural network [7]. Machine learning
and deep learning are also widely used to fill in missing values in
EMR. McLean et al. introduced Predictive Mean Matching, 𝐾Nearest
Neighbors, Iterative Imputer, and MICE to generate values for missing
data in EMR centered on oncology [8]. Farnaz et al. developed a
time series medical generative adjunctive network (GANs) for a wound
prognosis model that can generate continuous and categorical features
from EMR [9].
When solving the problem of data incompleteness, filling gender
information, i.e., gender recognition is also a research hotspot. For
gender identification, Li et al. introduced a multiple support vector
machine (SVM) gender classifier based on five facial features in addi-
tion to human hair and clothes [10]. The Gabor filter responses of face
images were used to identify gender and age [11]. A RestNet based
gender recognizer was developed by detecting and locating the face
landmarks on the regression tree set [12]. In addition to face images,
there are studies that use text, mobile phone behaviors, and neural
signals to distinguish males and females. Moumita et al. effectively
identified the male and female by extracting the Euler Numbers of
names [13]. The gender information of users is predicted by matching
the mobile text data of users with the gender representative word set
based on Web documents [14]. Dongxu et al. used reposing behav-
iors on social networks to distinguish male and female by combining
statistical knowledge and sociological knowledge [15]. Kaur et al.
tried to mine useful information from neural signals, they designed a
prediction framework to use neural signals collected by brain wave
sensors to identify age and gender [16]. In the medical field, Jun-
mei et al. developed a data management method using convolutional
neural network(CNN) to predict missing values of patient gender from
EMR [2]. Serkan et al. proposed a machine learning algorithm based
on multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) image measurement
of the patella, using a decision tree (DT) method to determine gen-
der [17]. Yuichiro et al. used brain MRI(magnetic resonance imaging)
to construct a multichannel 3D-CNN and verified the effect of brain
structure image patterns on gender recognition [18].
In this paper, we first analyze the differences between males and
females in medical examination items, and then build two gender
recognition models based on the results of the analysis to identify males
and females. The main contributions are summarized as follows:
1. An algorithm based on overlapping areas is proposed to analyze
the difference between males and females in medical examina-
tion;
2. Some common important attributions (CIAs) in a certain age
ranges are found to facilitate the recognition of males and females
via using cluster analysis, and an age range division algorithm is
proposed as a by-product;
3. Two gender recognition models (GRMs), i.e., GRM A for the
sample to be identified with known age, and GRM B for the
sample to be identified with unknown age, are developed to
identify the gender of samples. Experimental results show that in
certain age ranges, such as 17 to 51 years old, the proposed GRM
A and GRM B can reach 92.8% and 93.8% accuracy, respectively.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we
describe the dataset and analyze the differences between males and
females in medical examination. In Section 3, we further analyze
through cluster analysis and determine the medical examination items
that play an important role in gender recognition in each age subrange.
In Section 4, two gender recognition models are proposed according to
whether the age of the examples is known or not. Then, we evaluate
the proposed models and the role of data analysis in gender recognition
in Section 5. Finally, we conclude in Section 6.2. Data description and analysis
2.1. Data description
To analyze the differences between males and females in medical ex-
amination data, we collected 62,072 samples from the Xiangya Medical
Big Data System after desensitization. For ease of presentation, let be
the set of samples. Each sample contains 𝑁=39 medical examination
items (medical attributes) and 2 basic attributes (‘‘AGE’’: Age, ‘‘SEX’’:
Sex). In particular, Table 1 lists the medical attribute types, index,
attributes, and full name of attributes. The medical attributes include
the routine blood test, liver function test, renal function test, and
examination of plasma prothrombin time measurements. To grasp the
data structure in set , we list the common statistics of each attribute,
including the mean value (Mean), minimum (MIN), and maximum
(MAX). For the basic attributes, the minimum age and the maximum
age of samples in set are 1 and 70, respectively, i.e., the age range is
={1,2,…,69,70}. For the male samples, the value of attribute ‘‘SEX’’
is ‘‘0’’, while for the female samples, the value of attribute ‘‘SEX’’ is ‘‘1’’.
2.2. Difference analysis
The existing studies have shown that there are differences between
males and females in some medical attributes listed in Table 1. For
example, the medical attributes RBC, HGB, and HCT have a signifi-
cant differences between males and females after 2years old [19,20].
Through the statistical analysis of samples between 1 and 17 years old,
CREA and UA have a significant differences between males and females
within 12 to 17 years old [21]. However, the statistical methods used in
the aforementioned literature can only determine whether the distribu-
tions of medical attributes 𝛾of males and females are the same or not.
If they are not the same, the Difference between malEs and Females in
mEdical Attribute (DEFEA) 𝛾is considered significant. However, these
aforementioned literature has not revealed the change trend of DEFEA
𝛾, what we only know is there is the DEFEA 𝛾. In other words, they
do not compare the magnitude of DEFEA 𝛾. In short, these statistical
analysis cannot tell us the specific value of DEFEA 𝛾[22]. In what
follows, we analyze the DEFEA 𝛾through the distribution of medical
attribute𝛾of male and female, respectively.
Fig. 1 shows the numerical distribution of three medical attributes at
different ages of males and females. Specifically, Figs. 1(a), 1(b), and
1(c) illustrate the numerical distribution of medical attributes CREA,
HGB, and PT%, respectively. It is not difficult to find that for medical
attributes CREA and HGB, the numerical distribution of males and
females is almost the same at the age of 5. However, there are large
differences between the numerical distribution of males and females
over 5 years old. For the medical attribute PT%, the difference between
the numerical distribution of males and females is not obvious at these
ages. From the statistical viewpoint, for the medical attribute 𝛾, the
closer the numerical distribution of males and females is, the larger
the overlap area of the numerical distribution is. This implies that the
DEFEA𝛾at age𝑡can be evaluated with the overlap area 𝐎(𝑡,𝛾)of the
numerical distribution of medical attribute 𝛾of males and females at
age𝑡, given by
𝐃(𝑡,𝑟)=−ln(𝐎(𝑡,𝑟)), (1)

where𝛬𝛾is a set of subintervals generated by dividing uniformly the
value range of medical attribute 𝛾into multiple intervals, 𝑃𝑚(𝑡,𝑟,𝑗)
and𝑃𝑓(𝑡,𝑟,𝑗)represent the frequency of samples of medical attribute
𝛾of males and females belonging to the 𝑗th subinterval at age 𝑡,Array 14 (2022) 100140

respectively. Note that 𝐃(𝑡,𝑟)is negatively correlated with 𝐎(𝑡,𝑟), and
approximates 0 when 𝐎(𝑡,𝑟)is close to 1. In other words, the overlap
of the two numerical distributions means that there is no difference
between females and males in a medial attribute.
Fig. 2 shows the change of the value of DEFEA as age increases.
It can be seen that for most medical attributes, the value of DEFEA
is smaller than 0.5 at all ages and fluctuates with age. However, with
an increasing age, the value of DEFEA has obvious changes for some
medical attributes, such as CREA, HGB, HCT, RBC, UA, AST/ALT, and
ALT. In particular, one can see that for these medical attributes, the
value of DEFEA grows rapidly from the age of 12, and reaches the
highest point between the ages of 15 and 50 years old. After 50 years
old, the values of DEFEA CREA, HGB, HCT, RBC, and UA are still large,
while the values of DEFEA AST/ALT and ALT drop to a lower level
compared with other medical attributes, such as MONO#, MCH, and
LYM.
3. Cluster analysis
After the aforementioned analysis, one can find that only a few
medical attributes, such as CREA, ALT, have an obvious differences
between males and females in a certain age range in terms of the value
of DEFEA. The difference between the values of other medical attributes
is not obvious at each age. Can we find medical attributes, which play
an important role in distinguishing males and females with a higher
value of DEFEA at each age? To answer this question, in what follows,we focus on designing an effective method to divide age range into
an age subrange 𝑖, i.e.,∪𝑖𝑖=. As a result, in the age subrange 𝑖,
some common medical attributes can be used to distinguish males and
females. Note that to reduce the computational complexity and to take
into account the fact that the age itself is ordered, the age contained in
age subrange 𝑖should be adjacent, such as 𝑖={1,2,3}.
For easy of presentation, we define the mean value of the values of
DEFEAs at age 𝑡as
𝜋(𝑡)=∑
𝑟∈𝐃(𝑡,𝑟)
𝑁. (3)
If𝐃(𝑡,𝑟)is higher than 𝜋(𝑡), the medical attribute 𝛾is regarded as an
important attribute (IA) in distinguishing males and females at age 𝑡.
We introduce a matrix 𝐌whose element is given by
𝐌(𝑡,𝑟)={
1,if𝐃(𝑡,𝑟)>𝜋(𝑡)
0,other,(4)
where𝑡∈,𝑟∈. The cohesion of IAs in the age subrange 𝑖is

where𝐻(𝑡1,𝑡2)is calculated by
𝐻(𝑡1,𝑡2)=∑
𝑟∈|||𝐌(𝑡1,𝑟)−𝐌(𝑡2,𝑟)|||. (6)
As can be seen from Eqs. (5) and (6), the smaller the cohesion, the
larger similarity of IAs in age subrange 𝑖.Array 14 (2022) 100140
4S. He et al.
Fig. 1. Numerical distribution of (a) CREA, (b) HGB, (c) PT% in different ages.
Fig. 2. The value of DEFEAs.
By using the concept of cohesion, we use division hierarchical
clustering (DHC) to divide the age range into some age subranges
with the goal of minimizing the sum of cohesion of age subranges,
such that the IAs between ages in age subrange 𝑖is as the same as
possible. The detailed DHC is summarized as Algorithm 1. To illustrate
the process of running Algorithm 1, Fig. 3 gives out an example of the
number of age subranges is 10. One can see that when 𝑛= 10, eachage subrange contains a small number of age before the age of 16, and
contains more ages after the age of 16. This implies that the common
IAs changes frequently between the ages of 1 and 16 years, and tends
to be stable after the age of 16. Furthermore, the IAs of different ages
within the same age subrange obtained by DHC may also be different.
In the age subrange 𝑖, we regard the mean value of DEFEA 𝛾at all
ages as the value of DEFEA 𝛾, given by
𝐕(𝑖,𝑟)=∑
𝑡∈𝑖𝐃(𝑡,𝑟)
||𝑖||, (7)
where𝑟∈,||𝑖||means the number of ages in the age subrange 𝑖.
Similarly, for the age subrange 𝑖, we define the mean value of the
values of DEFEAs as
𝛱(𝑖)=∑
𝑟∈𝐕(𝑖,𝑟)
𝑁. (8)
If𝐕(𝑖,𝑟)is higher than 𝛱(𝑖), the medical attribute 𝛾is regarded as a
common important attribute (CIAs) in distinguishing males and females
in the age subrange 𝑖.

Through Algorithm 1, the age range is divided into many age
subranges, but excessive division is not necessary. To determine the
optimal number of age subranges, two methods are used in this paper.
One is to observe the changing trend of the sum of cohesion of all
age subranges as the number of age subranges increases. The other
is to observe the changing trend of the number of different CIAs in
all age subranges as the number of age subranges increases. Fig. 4
illustrates the aforementioned two trends with an increasing number
of age subranges. One observes that the total cohesion decreases with
the number of age subranges increases and tends to saturation. While,
the number of different CIAs in all age subranges increases with an
increasing number of age subranges and also tends to saturation. To
make the division results as accurate as possible, we need to make
trade-offs. On the one hand, it is necessary to avoid unnecessary
divisions. On the other hand, it is necessary to ensure that ages within
the same age subrange have similar CIAs. Combining these two factors,
in what follows, we divide age ranges into4age subranges is a better

choice,1i.e.,1={1,2,…,7},2={8,9,…,16},3={17,18,…,51},
4={52,53,…,70}. Table 2 lists the CIAs in age subrange 𝑖and the
ratio of DEFEA 𝛾calculated by
𝑟(𝑖,𝑟)=𝐃(𝑖,𝑟)∑
𝑘∈𝐃(𝑖,𝑘)⋅100%. (9)
In Table 2, there is a total of 27 different medical attributes. The
number of CIAs varies greatly across age subranges. Specifically, there
are 18 CIAs in the age subrange 1, which is the most. The number of
CIAs in the age subrange 3is 7, which is the least. In addition, the
number of CIAs in age subrange 2and4are 13 and 11, respectively.
This implies that the values of DEFEA CIAs and the values of DEFEA
non-CIAs in age subrange 1are not much different, on the contrary,
the values of DEFEA CIAs in age subrange 3are much higher than
that of non-CIAs, which is consistent with Fig. 2. For the most medical
attributes, the value of DEFEA remains below 0.4 at any age, we can
think that the smaller the number of CIAs in age subrange 𝑖, the higher
the value of DEFEA of CIAs in age subrange 𝑖.
Note that the correlation between CIAs is not considered in Algo-
rithm 1, therefore, the Pearson correlation method is firstly used to
reduce some correlated medical attributes for facilitating the construc-
tion of GRMs. Generally speaking, if the absolute value of Pearson
correlation coefficient corr (x, y)is greater than 𝛿=0.80, the variables
𝑥and𝑦have a strong correlation. Table 3 lists all medical attributes
with the absolute value of Pearson correlation coefficients larger than
𝛿. When corr (x, y)> 𝛿, we discard the medical attribute with a low
value of DEFEA. For a more intuitive display, Table 2 shows whether
the attribute is retained or not, in which ‘‘⁓⁓⁓⁓’’ means that the
medical attribute is discarded, otherwise the medical attribute is used
to construct the GRMs.
4. Gender recognition
To further assess the effectiveness of CIAs, in this section, according
to whether the age is known or not, we construct two GRMs to distin-
guish the gender of samples. In particular, we study an effective GRM
for case I in which the age is known. While, for the age is not known,
called case II, we design another GRM. For the sake of explanation, we
represent the reserved CIAs in the age subrange 𝐶𝑖as the set𝜎𝑖.
Case I: When the age is known, it is easy to know that the sam-
ple belongs to which of the four age subranges. This implies that we
can use the CIAs of each age subrange to construct the corresponding
GRM. Let the samples whose age belongs to age subrange 𝑖constitute
a sample subset 𝑖,𝑖∈𝜛={1,2,3,4}. It is not difficult to find that
the gender recognition problem belongs to two-classification problem.
Therefore, for the age subrange 𝑖, the two-classification learning algo-
rithm such as Logistic Regression (LR) [23], Random Forest (RF) [24],

can be used to construct the recognition model 𝐴𝑖. The recognition
model𝐴𝑖is trained with the samples in sample subset 𝑖by regarding
the elements in the set 𝜎𝑖as the features and the basic attribute SEX
as the label of samples, respectively. Thus, all recognition models 𝐴𝑖
constitute GRM A. When using GRM A for gender recognition, if the age
of sample to be identified is within the age subrange 𝑖, the sample is
identified by the corresponding recognition model 𝐴𝑖is shown in Fig. 5.
Case II: When the age is not known, we do not know which age
subrange the age of sample to be identified belongs to, it means
that the ideas of designing GRM A cannot be directly used. To
effectively exploit the CIAs of each age subranges, in what follows, we
design a three-classification learning for each age subrange. Then, the
integration learning method is used to construct GRM B to identify the
gender of the samples to be identified. Specifically, recognition model
𝐵𝑖for age subrange 𝐶𝑖has the ability of identifying the gender of the
sample and judging the age range of the sample by outputting three
probabilities 𝑝𝑖(𝑚),𝑝𝑖(𝑓), and𝑝𝑖(𝑜).𝑝𝑖(𝑚)is the probability that the
age of sample to be identified with the gender being males is within
the age subrange 𝑖.𝑝𝑖(𝑓)is the probability that the age of sample to
be identified with the gender being females is within age subrange 𝑖.
𝑝𝑖(𝑜)is the probability that the age of sample to be identified is not in
age subrange 𝑖. Unlike the training process of recognition model 𝐴𝑖,recognition model 𝐵𝑖is trained using samples at all ages. In particular,
to train recognition 𝐵𝑖, the CIAs in set ∪𝑖∈𝜛𝜎𝑖are regarded as features.
At the same time, the males sample and females sample in sample
subset 𝑖are labeled as ‘‘m’’ and ‘‘f’’, respectively, and the sample
in set∪𝑗≠𝑖𝑗is labeled as ‘‘o’’. Then, the three probabilities of each
age subrange are jointly used to identify the gender of samples via
computing the integrated probabilities of males and females, i.e.,
𝜌(𝑚)=∑
𝑖∈𝜛𝑝𝑖(𝑚)
𝑝𝑖(𝑜),
𝜌(𝑓)=∑
𝑖∈𝜛𝑝𝑖(𝑓)
𝑝𝑖(𝑜).(10)
If𝜌(𝑚)>𝜌(𝑓), the gender of sample is males, otherwise is females.
To clearly describe GRM B for case II, the detailed structure of GRM B is
illustrated in Fig. 6. Note that even the age of samples to be identified
is known, we also can use GRM B to identify the gender of samples
via ignoring the age information. This implies that GRM B has a wider
range of applications compared to GRM A.
5. Experiment
In this section, we evaluate the performance of the GRMs and
discuss further the role of CIAs as well as the important of the division
of age range. For each experiment, five learning algorithms, i.e., LR,
linear discriminant analysis (LDA) [ 25], naive Bayes (NB) [ 26], RF, and
gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) [ 27], are used. In addition, for
comparison, we also evaluate several simple GRM, i.e., GRM0, GRM1,
and GRM2. In particular, GRM0directly identifies the gender of the
sample via two-classification method, i.e., without considering the age
factor. GRM0is trained with samples at all ages and uses ∪𝑖∈𝜛𝜎𝑖as
the training feature. GRM1and GRM2regard the CIAs in ∪𝑖∈𝜛𝜎𝑖and in
∪𝑗≠𝑖𝜎𝑗as features to train GRM 𝐴𝑖, respectively. We take the recognition
result of recognition model 𝐴𝑖as the result of GRM A (GRM1and GRM2)
in age subrange 𝑖. The recognition results of GRM B and GRM0in age
subrange 𝑖are computed via the sample whose age belongs to age
subrange 𝑖.
Table 4 shows the recognition accuracy of GRM A and GRM B. It can
be seen that when we use the classical learning algorithm such as LR,
LDA, and NB, there is a comparable performance difference between
GRM A and GRM B in age subrange 1and2. Specifically, GRM A
obtains about 6% accuracy gain compared to GRM B. However, there
is a tiny difference between GRM A and GRM B in age subrange 3and
4. When using learning algorithms with strong learning ability, such
as RF and GBDT are adopted, the recognition accuracy of GRM B can
reach the level of GRM A in age subrange 1, and in age subrange 3
and4, GRM B outperforms GRM A. Experimental results show that the
lack of age information has a more severe impact on gender recognition
in age subrange 1and2. In addition, no matter GRM A or GRM B, the
accuracy of five algorithms is the lowest in age subrange 1, and is the
highest in age subrange 3. This is because the smaller the number of
CIAs in age subrange 𝑖, the larger the value of DEFEA in age subrange
𝑖. We also find that the smaller the number of CIAs in age subrange 𝑖,Array 14 (2022) 100140

the better the recognition accuracy of GRMs in age subrange 𝑖. This
shows that the medical attributes with a large value of DEFEA really
contribute to gender recognition.
Table 5 gives out the comparison between GRM0, GRM B, and GRM1
to further evaluate the effectiveness of GRM B and analyze the role
of age range division. Note that in most age subranges, GRM B with
the five learning algorithms obtains up to 1% gain. However, in the
age subrange 2, GRM B does not show an overwhelming advantage.
However, it is worth mentioning that if the learning algorithms NB, RF
or GBDT are used, the recognition accuracy of GRM B is still higher than
that of GRM0in age subrange 2. This means that GRM B is effective
even for age subrange 2which is most affected by the lack of age
information. At the same time, it also shows that if we do not know
the age of samples and divide the age range, we can still improve the
accuracy of gender recognition. Let us look at the results of another
group of control experiments, it can be seen that in all age subranges,
GRM1outperforms GRM0in terms of the recognition accuracy for the
five learning algorithms. In particular, in age subrange 1and2, the
average gain is 10.3%, while in age subrange 3and4, the average
gain is 2.8%. This means that if we know the age of samples, the
age range division will improve the accuracy of gender recognition
more, which is much higher than the case of unknown sample age.
Furthermore, the division of age range is more helpful for gender
recognition in age subrange 1and2. This is because the gender
differences are different in different age subranges, and learning theirgender difference information separately helps improve recognition
accuracy. If the age range is not divided, GRM is more inclined to
learn the gender difference information of medical attributions in age
subrange 3and4in which the gender difference is obvious.
Table 6 lists the comparison between GRM A, GRM1, and GRM2
to reflect the role of CIAs. We can see that in age subrange 1and
2, GRM1has no significant improvement in terms of the recognition
accuracy compared to GRM A. This means that for age subranges 1
and2, the selection of CIAs is appropriate, and we have not left out
any useful medical attributes for distinguishing males and females. For
age subranges 3and4, the participation of more medical attributes
leads to a small improvement in recognition accuracy. In particular, in
age subrange 3and4, GRM1obtains about 2% gain in terms of the
recognition accuracy at the cost of large computation complexity. This
means that the CIAs cover the vast majority of useful information for
distinguishing males and females. For example, in age subrange 3, the
five learning algorithms can achieve about 92% recognition accuracy
with only six CIAs. In age subrange 1and2, compared to GRM
A, GRM2has 10% recognition accuracy loss. While, the recognition
accuracy loss will be more in age subrange 3and4, close to 20%.
The values of DEFEA CIAs and the values of DEFEA non-CIAs in age
subrange 1and2are not much different, on the contrary, the values
of DEFEA CIAs in age subrange 3and4are much higher than
that of non-CIAs, which leads to the above situation. The above two
comparisons show that the CIAs are indeed more conducive to genderArray 14 (2022) 100140

6. Conclusion
In this paper, we proposed a method for calculating the difference
of medical attributes between males and females at a specified age via
the distribution of medical attributes of males and females. We find
that only a few medical attributes have an obvious differences between
males and females. Then, we further analyzed the differences between
males and females by cluster analysis, and found some CIAs in a certain
age subrange. In addition, we proposed two GRMs based on the results
of data analysis to identify the gender of samples according to whether
the age is known or not. Experiment results have shown that in a
certain age range, such as 17 to 51 years old, the proposed GRM can
reach 92.8% accuracy using only six medical attributes. In addition to
evaluating GRM recognition effect, we also verified the effectiveness of
GRM B, cluster analysis, and CIAs through comparative experiments.
