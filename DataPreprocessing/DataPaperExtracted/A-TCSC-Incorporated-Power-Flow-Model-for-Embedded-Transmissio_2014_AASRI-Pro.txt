 their maximum limits. Hence the question of transmission usage allocation and reactive power compensation is of great importance. In a modern power system  Transmission usage allocation must be intended in a reasonable and apparent manner that is economically equitable to each and every one  market players, not only with the intent of correct revenue reconciliation st rategies that recover system-wide transmission asset and operational costs, but also with the goal of increasing market efficiency. In present era FACTS devices play a vital role to solve the problems like overloading and reactive power compensation in efficient way. Many FACTS devices are used around the world to regulate active and reactive power flow along with maintaining desired voltage profile. The first attempt to allocate power flows was done by Bialek et al. when Topological Generation Distribution factors based power flow tracing were proposed in March 1996 [1], which explained the method for tracing generator's output. They introduce a simple topological method of tracing the flow of real and reactive power in transmis sion networks. In Feb 1997, Kirschen et al. [2] explained a power flow tracing method based on the proportional sharing assumption which introduces the concept of domains, Commons, and links. In Nov 2000, Gu bina et al. [3] described the method to determine the generators’ contribution to a particular load by using the nodal generation distribution factors. In Aug 2000, Wu et al. [4] explained the use of graph theory to  calculate the contributions of individual generators and loads to line flows and the real power transfer among distinctive generators and loads. In 2009, Xie et al.[5] proposed and explained the power flow tracing algorithms founded in the extended incidence matrix considering loop flows. Similarly, the existing loss allocation methods may be classified into prorata method, marginal method, power flow tracing-based methods, and circuit theory based methods [6]. Prorata method  allocated losses to load and generators in equal manne r [6]. In marginal procedure, incremental transmission coefficients are used for allocation of transmission lo sses to demands and generators [7]. The use of tracing methods for allocation of transmission losses is prese nted in [8].A method based on a combination of cooperative game theory and circuit theory is presented in [9]. In [10] a novel algorithm is proposed for transmission loss allocation, which is used path integral and based on transaction strategy. A usage based loss allocation method is proposed in [11]. In [12] method based on circuit theory and the concept of orthogonal projection for pool based electricity market is proposed. FACTS device has the capability of regulating the power flow and voltage support at the buses. It provides the properties of both shunt and series compensations in order to regulate the power flow and simultaneously support the voltage at the bus. Modeling of these devices such as SVC, STATCOM and UPFC has been done effectively in [16, 17]. In [14] Newton Raphson algorithm for large power system with FACTS devices was presented [15]. In this paper authors presented a usage and loss allocation method along with TCSC incorporation in power flow model. A tracing algorithm presented in [5]  is used and modified for usage and loss allocation. Newton Raphson method of load flow is used for power flow which is modified for incorporation of TCSC. Results with and without TCSC is presented on Sample 5 bus system. 2. Proposed Matrices Methodology Let consider a simple diagraph G showed in Fig1.[13]

Diagonal elements give net flows at nodes and off diagonal elements give the actual flows and counter flows in the system. The proposed matrix is defined as follows: active power in branch

Power fl ow allocated to generators from the lines flow as shown in Eq. (5). For this allocation 23% share is allocated to generators and 77% is allocated to loads. For exam

The idea of changeable series reactance is used to make the power flow model with TCSC in which value of series reactance adjusted to control the power flow. The modelling of TCSC in Newton Raphson load flow is presented in [16]. Power flow equation of TCSC can be written as PK=V

Result And Discussion The proposed matrices methodology is apply to the 5 bus structure to demonstrate feasibility and effectiveness of the methodology. An Executable c ode is developed under MATLAB. Test is conducted on standard 5 bus system.  For analysis bus 1is slack bus, bus 2 is voltage controlled bus and 3, 4, 5 are load buses. TCSC is installed between bus 3 and 4 by introduced an additional bus 6. For TCSC starting value of the inductive reactance is taken 0.015 pu (50% of value of the inductive reactance of the transmission line).

5. Conclusion Author presents a tracing based usage and loss sharing methodology with incorporation of FACTS devices. TCSC is incorporated with voltage source modelling structure for compensating the reactive power and 50   Baseem Khan et al.  /  AASRI Procedia   7  ( 2014 )  45 – 50 
 improving the voltage profile. With TCSC power flow of transmission is increased hence transmission usage allocation and transmission loss allocation also increased. Voltage source modelli ng is used for FACTS incorporation because by this effect of TCSC at each iteration is incorporated in system. Further usage and loss allocation is done in direct way because matrix inversion is required only single time. The methodology is applied on sample 5 bus. References [1] J. Bialek, D. B.
