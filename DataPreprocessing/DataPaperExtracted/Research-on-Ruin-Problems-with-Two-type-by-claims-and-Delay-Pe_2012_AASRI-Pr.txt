Abstract 
In this paper, we propose a new a new risk model with two-type by-claims and delay period based on compound binomial distribution, in which every main claim induces two kinds of by-claims but either of the by-claims maybe delayed to the next period. The nature of the risk model with time-correlated claims is studied based on recursion of joint distribution functions. Through introducing three submodels, we obtain the expression of the joint distribution 
(,, )fuxy  of the surplus just before ruin and deficit at ruin when initial surplu s is 0 and the recursive formula of the joint distribution when  initial surplus is
u. In addition, when initial surplus is 0 the ruin probability of the risk model is given. At last, we provide the method to compute the ruin probability when initial surplus is 
u.

1. Introduction In the classical risk model, assumption of independence among claims is an important condition to the study of risk models. However, in many practical situations, this assumption is often inconsistent with the operation of insurance companies. Sometimes, claims ar e time-correlated, and it is necessary to study risk

models that are more realistic. Ambagaspitiya, 1998,1999 and Partrat,1999 studied the probability distribution, moment generating function and ruin probability of ma in claims under the condition of correlated aggregated claims; Yuen and Guo, 2001 studied the compound binomial model with time-correlated claims, in which each claim causes one kind of by-claim that maybe delayed, and obtained the finite survive probability; Xiao and Guo, 2007 obtained the recursive formula of joint distribution 
(,, )fuxy of the surplus just before ruin and the deficit at ruin, but still only one kind by-claim. Unlike their models above, we studied a new risk model with practical significance. Consider the claims in a car accident, the vehicle damage may induce bodily injury or property damage at the same time or af terwards, so in this risk model each main claim causes two kinds of by-claims, and both kinds have the probability being delayed to the next time period. In our study, we give the recursive formula of joint distribution 
(,, )fuxy  of the surplus just before ruin and the deficit at ruin, the ruin probability is also obtained. 2. Depict of the model In this risk model, we assume each claim produces two kinds of by-claims. Denote the discrete time units by 
0,1, 2,...k .In time period (1 , ]kk , a main claim happens with a probability of (0 1)qq , thus 
1pq   is the probability of no main claims. We assume that the occurrences of main claims in different time periods are independent. The first by-claim and its associated main claim may occur in the same time period with probability 
1r, or the occurrence of the by-claim maybe delayed to the next time period with probability 
11r ; the other by-claim and its associated main claim may occur concurrently with probability
2r, or the by-claim maybe delayed and occur in the next time period with probability 21r . All claim amounts are independent, positive and integer valued. Main claim amounts
12,,XXÂ˜Â˜Â˜Ä‚  are independent and identically distributed random variables with common probability 
^` (1 , 2 ,)lhP X = l l  Â˜ Â˜ Â˜Ä‚ , probability generating function
()1lhz h zllfÂ¦   , and expectation 1lhlXlPfÂ¦  . The two types of by-claims 12,,YYÂ˜Â˜Â˜Ä‚  and 
12,,ZZÂ˜Â˜Â˜Ä‚ are independent and identically distributed random variables with common probability 
^` (1 , 2 , )mg= P Y = m m =Â˜Â˜Â˜ and^` (1 , 2 , )nk= PZ = n n =Â˜Â˜Â˜ , probability generating function ()gy, ()kzand expectation 
YP,ZP respectively.  We assume initial surplus 
u is a non-negative integer. XkW,YkWand ZkW are the total amount of main claims and two kinds of by-claims respectively. With  the assumption that the premium collected per period is 1, the surplus process is defined as :

(1)0Uu  is the initial surplus. Define ^`11inf : 0k Tk U   as the ruin time, and ^`(1)()uP TI  f  as the ruin probability. 3. Joint distribution of the surplus just before ruin and deficit at ruin in simple case 
0u  There are four different cases when claims occur: a ma in claim and its two by-claims occur concurrently in some period, then the surplus process gets renewed but the initial value; a main claim and its first by-claim occur simultaneously in some period but its second by-cla im is delayed and occurs in the next period; a main claim and its second by-claim occur simultaneously in some period but its first by-claim is delayed and occurs in the next period; a main claim occurs in some period  but the two types of by-claims are both delayed to the next period. Then in the last three cases the surplus pr ocesses behave differently because of the delayed by- claim occurring in the next period. Thus we define the following three new surplus processes:

 With Theorem 1 and Theorem 2, we can compute the joint distribution of the surplus just before ruin and deficit at ruin when 
u is of any value. Furthermore, sum (,, )fuxy  over x from 0 to f and y from 1 to
f, we can finally have the ruin probability ()uI  when initial is u. 5. Conclusion Considering the claims in a car accident, and the vehi cle damage may induce bodily injury or property damage at the same time or afterwards, we studied a new risk model with two-type by-claims and delay Period based on compound binomial distribution. The natu re of the risk model with time-correlated claims is studied based on recursion joint distribution functions. The recursive formula of joint distribution 
(,, )fuxy  of the surplus just before ruin and the deficit at ruin, and the ruin probability are obtained. The results are helpful to research the other risk models from such as [6,7]. 6.
