Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA) is a newly developed swarm intelligence based optimization method. Its analyticalmodel mimics self-organized swarming and foraging behavior of salps. Salps are found in the ocean and they forma swarm calledsalp chainfor their organized movement and foraging. Since its inception in 2017, SSA has beenapplied to many engineering domains. This paper presents the solution of complex constrained multi-area eco-nomic dispatch problem of power system with and without stochastic wind integration using SSA. Simulationanalysis has been carried on four different constrained test cases with diverse dimensions/complexity level. Theyare (i) four area system with sixteen thermal units (ii) four area system with forty thermal units (iii) two areasystem with forty thermal units and (iv) two area forty-unit system with wind integration. Comparison ofsimulation results obtained by SSA with other methods reported in the recent literature has proven SSA ’s capability of constrained handling and offered promising and ef ﬁcient solutions.
1. IntroductionDue to rising complexity and the size of real-world optimizationproblems Bio-inspired optimization approaches became very popular inpast decade among researchers of almost all application domains. TheBio-inspired optimization techniques are stochastic in nature and theyapply randomness for searching the solution. The randomness helps inthe development of a gradient-free search mechanism. Most of theseoptimization techniques are inspired by natural phenomena and they canbe grouped either based on evolution, collective behaviour (swarm-based), ecological phenomenon, physical science. These algorithms haveproven their great potential to deal with real-world optimization prob-lems. The classiﬁcation of Bio-inspired optimization methods is pre-sented inFig. 1.Evolution based algorithm utilises the concept of natural evolutionsuch as reproduction, mutation, recombination and selection. Some ofthe popular optimization method in this category are genetic algorithms(GA) [1], differential evolution (DE) [2] and backtracking search algo- rithm(BSA) [3].In fact among bio-inspired optimization methods swarm intelligencebased optimization approaches are quite popular and ef ﬁcient. The key features of swarm intelligence (SI) based algorithms are self-organizationand division of work to achieve a given task. For Example, Particle swarmoptimization (PSO) [4] simulates biological behaviour ofﬁsh schooling and birdﬂocking, artiﬁcial bee colony (ABC) [5] optimization simulates collective foraging behaviour of honey bees, whale optimization algo-rithm (WOA) [6] follows behaviour of humpback whales, grasshopperoptimization (GOA) [7] follows their unique swarming behaviour, spidermonkey optimization(SMO) [8] mimics theﬁssion-fusion social structure of spider monkeys, grey wolf optimizer (GWO) [ 9] mimics the hunting behaviour and social leadership of grey wolf, TLBO [ 10] models the ef- fect of the inﬂuence of a teacher on the output of students in the class-room and many others.The next class of bio-inspired optimization methods belongs to opti-mization methods inspired by the concept of physical Sciences. The mostpopular and efﬁcient optimization methods in this class are simulatedannealing (SA) [11] inspired by annealing process of metal, Harmonysearch (HS) [12] follows the concept of jazz’s improvisation process and then the search of the perfect state of harmony by musician, Gravitationsearch algorithm(GSA) [13] utilises the concept of Newton ’s law of gravitation and laws of motion, chemical reaction optimization (CRO)

[20–24]. These include applications related to medical science, job shop scheduling, image processing,parameter estimation, power, and energy. Economic dispatch (ED) is oneof the most complex constrained optimization problems of the integratedpower system [25]. The main aim of ED is to allocate the power demandamong the committed generator units in the most economical mannerwhile satisfying all the physical and operational constraints. The practicalED problem is highly non-linear and non-convex with multiple minimadue to practical operational constraints like valve point loading (VPL)effects, discontinuous due to prohibited operating zones (POZ) and ramprate limits (RRL). Over the past decades various single area ED problemsconsidering VPL effect [26–31], RRL [27,30,32,33] and POZ[32,34–36] were solved without considering transmission constraints.However, many utilities have their own limitations for power ﬂows among different areas/regions over transmission lines. Every area/regionhas its own load pattern and power generation characteristics. Multi-areaeconomic dispatch (MAED) is an extension of ED, where the objective isto calculate power generation as well as the exchange of power betweendifferent areas at minimum cost while satisfying additional powertransmission capacity constraints along with all equality and inequalityconstraints associated with ED problems. Due to the additional trans-mission line powerﬂow limit constraints, MAED problem becomes morecomplex to solve. Therefore, for the solution of such a complex con-strained optimization problem a latest and ef ﬁcient bio-inspired opti- mization approach is required.Various bio-inspired optimization algorithms were reported in theliterature for the solution of MAED problems [ 37–50].

2single objective MAED problem with different dimension and complexitylevels are found in Ref. [37–47]. They are harmony search (HS) [37,38], differential evolution(DE) [39], artiﬁcial bee colony (ABC) [40],ﬂower pollination algorithm(FPA) [42], particle swarm optimization (PSO)[44], hybrid cuckoo search algorithm(HCSA) [ 45], hybrid differential evolution based PSO (DEPSO) [41] and moth-ﬂame optimization(MFO) [43]. Considering clean air policy and global warming concept, solutionof multi-objective MAED problems are also presented using PSO [ 48], chaotic artiﬁcial bee colony (CABC) [49] and improved Jaya algorithm (IJA) [50].In the present scenario, the Integration of wind and solar energyamong renewable energy resources is gaining wide acceptance due totheir emission-free low-cost operation. However, as wind speed is un-certain therefore, uncertainty associated with wind power is incorpo-rated in objective function using a mathematical model calledprobabilistic density function (pdf). Out of many pdf models, Weibulldistribution [21,51,52], beta distribution [53] and gamma distribution [54] are used by researchers to calculate cost due to random wind power.The effect of large wind power integration in MAED problems isinvestigated for a combined wind-thermal system for Taiwan powersystem using a direct search approach (DSA) in Ref. [ 55], where 52 unit thermal systems were used with cost function as a second-order poly-nomial in nature. Using all complexity of practical thermal generator unitas VPL, RRL and POZ, the impact of wind integration was analyzed usingthe backtracking search algorithm (BSA) in Refs. [ 56]. Even though various optimization techniques are proposed for thesolution of MAED problems, according to No Free Lunch Theorem [ 57], none of the algorithms can guarantee to solve all optimization problems.There is always a chance of improvement; keeping that in mind, thispaper presents the Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA) for the solution of MAEDproblem.Application of a novel swarm intelligence based SSA algorithm for thesolution of MAED problems is the signiﬁcant and major contribution of this paper. The paper also presents Weibull pdf model for the calculationof wind power. In order to validate the performance of SSA over MAEDproblem, four cases with different dimensions and complexity levelswhich possess non-linear, multimodal, non-convex, discontinuous andprobabilistic modal due to wind integration are evaluated. The obtainedresults using SSA are also compared with recently reported results in theliterature.Rest of the paper is organized as follows: formulation of the problemthat combines the concept behind MAED, wind power modeling and therelated constraints are described in section 2. Section3presents the
concept behind the SSA, its foraging behavior using an analytical modeland implementation procedure for the solution of MAED problem.Description of test cases, effect of control parameters, simulation resultsand their discussion are presented in section 4. Finally, conclusions are drawn in section5.2. Problem formulationThe key objective of MAED problem is to minimize total operatingcost in all areas in such a manner that it will satisfy all operationalconstraints associated with it, i.e. power balance, minimum andmaximum power generation limits, RRL, POZ and area wise capacityconstraints of tie-line/transmission line.The objective function of MAED problem with wind integration canbe expressed as:MinimizeF

Salp swarm algorithmSalp Swarm Algorithm (SSA) is a recent bio-inspired optimizationtechnique [58], inspired by navigation and foraging behaviour of salpchain, generally found in deep oceans. In its mathematical model, salppopulation is divided into two groups called leader and followers. Thebest salp (best solution) is considered as the food source to be followed bythe salp chain. After every iteration, the leader salp changes its positionwith respect to the food sources. The leader explores and exploits thesearch space around the best solution and the follower salps movegradually towards the leader. This process helps salps in converging tothe global optima quickly while preventing from being trapped in localoptima.Fig. 3depicts the salp chain. The front salp of the chain is calledleader while other salps of the chain are called followers. The leader salpguides the follower salps.The salp locations are deﬁned in then-dimensional search space: Wherenis the number of decision variables in the problem.Let us assume there is a food sourceFSin the search space as swarm ’s target. As per the location of the food source, leader updates its positionusing the equation(21)as below:x

The implementation process of SSA to solve MAEDproblems is depicted with the help ofﬂowchart given inFig. 4.4. Description of test cases and simulation resultsThe performance of SSA is evaluated and validated on four standardtest cases of MAED problems with different dimensions and complexitylevels. SSA has been implemented in MATLAB13 environment andexecuted on 2.40GHz, i5 processor with 8GB RAM and is simulated over30 independent runs for all test cases. Description of test cases and theoutcome of simulation results obtained by SSA are presented below.Test Case I:This test case has four areas. Each area consists of fourpower generating unit systems connected using six tie lines [ 37]. The fuel cost coefﬁcient data, tie-line powerﬂow limits along with area wise power demands are listed inTable A1. The network topology used in this test case with four areas consisting of sixteen power generating unitssystem is shown inFig. 5.The simulation results obtained by SSA in terms of area wise optimumgeneration scheduling are listed inTable 1and the comparison of costs with other metaheuristics is summarized in Table 2. The optimum gen- eration cost obtained by SSA is 7337.0139 $/hr. Fig. 6shows the smooth and stable cost convergence characteristic obtained by SSA.Test Case II: It is a comparatively large dimension test case with fortypower generator units having non-convex fossil fuel cost characteristicswith multiple minima. Transmission loss is not considered here. The fuelcost coefﬁcients data and power generation limits are listed in Table A2 as reported in Ref. [26]. The total load demand is set at 10500 MW. Hereforty power generating units are segregated in four areas. Each area withten power generating units shares power demand as 1575MW (15%) inarea one, 4200MW (40%) in area two, 3150MW (30%) in area three, and1575MW (15%) in area four respectively [ 40]. The tie-line powerﬂow limitations are considered as follows: (i) be-tween area 1 to area 2 or from area 2 to area 1 is 200MW, (ii) between
area 1 to area 3 or from area 3 to area 1 is 200MW, (iii) between area 3 toarea 2 or from area 2 and area 3 is 200MW, (iv) between area 4 to area1or from area1 to area 4 is 100MW,(v) between area 4 to area 2 or fromarea 2 to area 4 is 100MW and (vi) between area 3 to area 4 or from area4 to area 3 considered as 100MW.Here the best cost obtained by SSA is 122471.666 $/hr, the corre-sponding generation schedule is presented in Table 3and its statistical results are summarized inTable 4.

7characteristic for combined WT obtained by SSA is presented in Fig. 11.4.1. Effect of control parameterSSA is a population-based algorithm. Apart from population size,termination criteria and other common parameters it has only one con-trol parameterC
1. To get optimum value, simulation analysis has beencarried out with different population (search agent) sizes keepingmaximum number of iterations 500 as the stopping criteria. Performanceof SSA over 30 repeated trials is analyzed on Test Case I and the outcomeof results are presented inFig. 12andFig. 13, respectively. Here it is observed that with population size of 200, SSA attained minimum costwith less standard deviation. However, with further increase in popula-tion size there is no improvement in operational cost but average CPUtime increases. Therefore, population size of 200 is considered forsimulation analysis of MAED problems.Now toﬁnd the optimal value of control parameter C
1which is coupled with current iteration and maximum iteration by exponentialterm as deﬁned in(22)and plotted inFig. 14. Here it is observed that the value ofC
1exponentially decreases as iteration progresses, which showsthe exploration in the initial stage and then exploitation in the later stage.4.2. Comparative analysis4.2.1.

8optimum cost obtained by SSA 7337.0139 $/hr is found to be compa-rable with MFO [43], HLSO [41] and better than IHS [38], IFEP [38] and IDEPSO4 [41], reported in the recent literature.For large dimension problem (Test Case II), the optimal generationschedule and statistical results in terms of costs are summarized in Ta- bles 3 and 4respectively. By comparison of costs reported by othermetaheuristics it is observed that SSA can acquire lowest cost122471.666 $/hr as compared to real coded genetic algorithms (RCGA)[40], differential evolution (DE) [40], evolutionary programming (EP) [40], artiﬁcial bee colony optimization (ABCO) [ 40], cuckoo search al- gorithm (CSA) [45] andﬂower pollination algorithm (FPA) [42]. Also the mean cost 122507.5003 $/hr obtained by SSA is found to be superior ascompared to the best cost reported by other methods, which supports toclaims the global search capability of SSA.For two area network (Test case III) which has non-convex as well asdiscontinuous fuel cost characteristics due to VPL effect and POZ both areconsidered here. The minimum cost solution obtained by SSA is124647.0508 $/hr and corresponding generation schedule is listed inTable 5. While comparing its statistical results in terms of cost with othermethods inTable 6, such as stochastic fractal search (SFS) [ 47], hybrid DEPSO with different mutation strategy of DE, DEPSO1 to DSPSO4 [ 41], Hybrid sum local search optimizer (HLSO) [ 41] and MFO [43] and DEC2 [39], it is observed that the minimum cost obtained by SSA is better.Test case IV is a modiﬁed version of Test case III, and modiﬁcation has been done by replacing three thermal generators by the wind generators.It has highest complexity among all cases considered for simulationanalysis. It includes complexity like probabilistic constraints due to windintegration in addition to VPL, RRL and POZ of the thermal system,makes the objective function multimodal as well as discontinuous innature and henceﬁnding global minima solution for such a complexconstrained problem has become quite difﬁcult task. For such a complex and highly constrained test case also SSA is able to obtain optimumgeneration cost of 120857.2447 $/hr which is found to be lower by3789.8061 $/hr as compared to Test Cast III. Its detail solution which islisted inTable 7, shows the better constrained handling capability of SSA.Therefore, we can say SSA has a strong ability to ﬁnd a better quality of the solution.But for two test cases, it is observed that minimum cost of SSA isfound to be inferior as compared to hybrid version meta-heuristics re-ported in the literature listed inTables 2 and 4, respectively. They are (i) for test case I, the best cost reported using a hybrid harmony searchTable 7Optimal generation scheduling for two area forty unit wind-thermal system (Testcase IV).

9(HHS) [37] is 7329.85$/hr, while SSA has 7337.0139 $/hr. (ii) for testcase II the best cost obtained using JAYA-TLBO [ 46] is 121694.4 $/hr while using SSA it is 122471.666 $/hr.4.2.2. Computational efﬁciencyThe best cost solution achieved by SSA and corresponding generationschedule for different cases are presented in Tables 1, 3, 5 and 7show the ability to satisfy constraints for complex constrained optimization prob-lems. The average CPU time required to converge into the optimum so-lution for all four test cases are shown in Fig. 15. Considering dimensions and complexity levels of problems taken under consideration, suchcomputational times are quite justiﬁed. Therefore, it can be said that SSAis computationally efﬁcient also.4.2.3. RobustnessThe statistical results in terms of cost simulated over 30 independentruns of all four test cases having different dimensions/complexity aresummarized inTable 2,Table 4,Table 6, andTable 8. The robustness of the algorithm is analyzed on the basis of mean cost and standard devi-ation (SD). For test case I, the mean cost of SSA is found to be inferior tohybrid/improved version of metaheuristics reported in literature ashybrid sum-local search optimizer (HLSO) [ 41], DEPSO4 [41] but su- perior to MFO [43]. Here the SD of cost for SSA is also higher ascompared to others.For large dimension test case II, even the worst cost solution of SSA122737.9965 $/hr is found to be superior to the best cost reported by EP[40], DE [40], ABCO [40], FPA [42] and CSA [45] listed inTable 4. For two area system test case III, with the nonlinear, multimodal anddiscontinuous objective function, the mean cost 124688.4065 $/hr ofSSA is better as compared to other bio-inspired methods as variants of DE[41], MFO [43], SFS [47] and ISFS [47] listed inTable 6. Here also it is observed that SD of cost 88.1322 for SSA is either superior or almostcomparable to other reported methods except DEC2 [ 39]. Comparing the results of Test case III and Test case IV, i.e. MAEDproblem of thermal system and then MAED problem of wind-thermalsystem as presented inTables 6 and 8, it has been observed that cost is reduced signiﬁcantly by wind integration but due to additional proba-bilistic constraints, standard deviation of the cost is found to be large.Based on this discussion, we can say SSA is a robust optimizationapproach.5. ConclusionIn this paper, a salp swarm algorithm is implemented to solve MAEDproblems with different dimensions and operational complexity. Byanalyzing the generation schedule, it has been observed that all opera-tional constraints are fully satisﬁed for all the test cases having differentdimensions and complexity level. It proves that SSA can ef ﬁ
ciently handle the constraints. Through comparison of best cost solution withother metaheuristics, SSA is found to be effective in terms of solutionquality too. The average CPU time required to converge into the optimumsolution has also been analyzed, considering the dimension andcomplexity of problems. SSA is found to be suf ﬁciently fast converging algorithm. Despite providing good results, it has been observed that SSAsuffers from premature convergence especially for test cases havingobjective function non-convex, discontinuous and probabilistic in nature.It may be due to parameterC
1, which decreases exponentially and isresponsible for exploration and exploitation during the optimizationprocess. Therefore a more extensive research on the sensitivity analysis ofparameterC
1can further improve SSA.Vishal Chaudhary: Writing - original draft, Software. Hari MohanDubey: Data curation, Conceptualization. Manjaree Pandit: Supervision.J. C.
