Integrated circuit(IC) fabrication technology has improved to 7 nm resulting that IC can accommodatemore transistors to implement system-on-a-chip(SOC). SOC generally consists of a great quantity digital circuits with speciﬁc functions. Diverse signals not only convey inside but also communicate outsideamong circuits. For hundreds of thousands interlaced and complicated signals, it is an extreme big chal-lenge to route in shrink channel. In this work, we propose a complexity effect routing algorithm based onthe Lee algorithm to achieve fast veriﬁcation for SOC. The advantages are to gain fast evaluated for var-ious architectures of route, trace path from origin to destination and set diverse complexity to simulateSOC architectures. Experimental results demonstrate the achievements on ﬁve complexity sets of routingbenchmarks./C2112018 The Author. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of King Saud University.

1. IntroductionAdvance fabrication brings the inclusion of system-on-a-chip (SOC) that coexist processor and all the necessary components.As follow the latest technology of semiconductors nanometer pro-cess, the length of transistors is designed inside SOC that improvescapacity, performance and reliability. At the same time, more andmore circuit modules are integrated into SOC resulting in routingthrough all modules and becomes a lot much difﬁcult.2. SOC routingRouting technique is continuously studied in designing SOC. Inpre-SOC stage, Farooq et al.[1]presented a novel exploration ﬂowwith optimized inter-FPGA routing on multi-FPGA platform. Also,Kan et al.[2]addressed RAS validation on NoC routing issue. Asintellectual property(IP) core SOC, El-Naggar et al.[3]adoptednet- work on chip(NoC) to route among IP blocks and proposed univer- sal veriﬁcation methodology(UVM) to verify design. In post-routingstage, Tsai et al.[4]presented DVI-X algorithm with considerationof single via and redundant-via candidates of chips. Moreover, Fan[5]implemented a routing tool based on line-probe routingalgorithm. Ininternet-of-things(IoT) network, Fan[6]presented that clique-ﬁrst adaptive routes approach had gained high perfor-mance. Additionally, he pointed power saving to demonstrate arouting-aware approach in[7]. Other routing algorithms addressedin[8]. Moreover, Xu et al.[9]solved the maze routing problem inthe routing stage by redundant-via insertion method. On the otherhand, Lembach et al.[10]focused on high quality routing to phys-ical design. In Manhattan path research, Zhao et al. [11]paid more attention to a path-counter method with low time complexity tofault-tolerant minimal paths. The proposed approach can applyto arbitrary fault distribution. Also, the existing paths can bechecked and the fault blocks effect does not affect available nodes.For dedicated routing and XY routing issue, Agrawal et al. [12]pre- sented two algorithm to solve the test-delivery and dynamic pro-gramming problems. The proposed method was separately testedby 1000 and 1600 cores experiments for test scheduling of powerconstraints. Ren et al.[13]also adopted two-phase routing algo-rithm for routing on-chip trafﬁc problems. The effectiveness ofthe proposed method was tested by extensive experiments, andwas compared with previous algorithms.3. Complexity effect routingAdvance nano-process integrated circuit technology producesan extreme tiny transistor to achieve lighter and faster products.Minimized transistors expand capacity to accommodate moreand more digital circuits but shrink the path among elements.Moreover, the area of chip is either the same or smaller than pre-vious products. In other words, new technology makes the design

chip becoming more difﬁcult resulting from tiny transistor, morecircuits and narrow paths. Besides, within same area which placesmore circuits result in the usable communicating path are greatlydecreased. As a modern chip with more and more circuits but lessand less usable path, nano-process technology obviously brings anew challenge on exacerbating routing problem.4. Complexity effect routing algorithmIn this paper, we present acomplexity effect routing algorithm(CERA) based on the Lee algorithm[8]with the aim of fast routing veriﬁcation with visual stepping propagation, graphical trace andretrace and the shortest path. The Lee algorithm adopts breadth-ﬁrst search to communicate from origin to destination. It routeson either horizontal or vertical direction on grid plane. A well-known routing technology, Manhattan routing, also obeys horizon-tal or vertical way which is the de facto routing standard in chip[14]. On the other hand, the Lee algorithm has three advantages.One is visual stepping propagation from origin to target. Anotheris from destination to source or vice versa to graphical trace orretrace. The other is the shortest path for link if the route exists.Despite Lee’s algorithm was proposed in 1991, its route approachcorresponded to cross section which was as same as some com-mercial tools such as Laker of Synopsys [15]or Virtuoso of Cadence [16]. Both academic research and commercial company notice thatthe route of chip will be more and more complex and complicatedin the future. Therefore, the CERA adds the complex effect to routeso as to observe the effect of block circuits. Speciﬁcally, it is com-bined complexity into Lee algorithm to gain the complex routingeffects with the function of visual examination, graphical traceand shortest path in chip designs. Those features make CERA valu-able in comparison to commercial CAD tools.On the basis of aforementioned explanations, the routing prob-lem of SOC is deﬁned as follows. For a SOC design in grid plane, thenumber of cross points of chip for Manhattan plane is deﬁned inthe following
Pði;jÞ¼i/C2j ð1Þ
whereiis the number of lines in x-axis and jis the number of lines in y-axis.
Fig. 1illustrates the Manhattan plane on blocking routebetween source and destination.Fig. 1(a) shows the Manhattan plane with 3/C23 cross point andFig. 1(b) displays two obstacles in Manhattan plane. The obstacles may be irrelevant circuits whichmust be isolated from source and destination to avoid short circuit.Therefore, the link between origin and target must bypass obsta-cles. Otherwise, the SOC design works incorrectly caused by shortcircuits.Fig. 1(c) shows the source and destination using twoobstacles in Manhattan plane. Based on Fig. 1(c), the number of usable points for link between source and destination can bederived as follow
Uði;jÞ¼Pði;jÞ/C0Xo/C0kð2Þ
whereois the obstacle andkrepresents the number of points ofsource and destination.FromFig. 1(d) to (g) are the more obstacles result the less pathto link from source to destination. One key factor of successfulroute depends on the number of obstacles. Therefore, we deﬁnethe ratio ofPandUas complex effect in the following
CðP;UÞ¼ðP/C0UÞ/C0kP/C2100%ð3Þ
wherePis the number of cross points,Uis the number of usable points andkis the number of points for source and destination.
After placing the obstacles and determine location of source anddestination, the route can only walk on the vacant points ratherthan move to the blocks. Consequently, those vacant points forma set of classV, which is deﬁned in the following
V¼f v1;v2;v3;...;vugð 4Þ
where v1,v2,v3,..., vuare vacant points of XY coordination, sub-scriptuis the number ofU.
Fig. 2exhibits the procedures of the CERA approach and thethree advantages, which are visual stepping propagation, graphicalretrace and the shortest path.Fig. 2(a) displays the complexity as 22% based on Eq.(3)for a given routing plane. The ﬁrst steppingpropagation departs from orange point to west and north as showninFig. 2(b). On mark 1 as location west of orange point, there is nopath with other neighbours. Therefore, the other mark 1 as locationnorth of orange point steps one from source. Fig. 2(c) shows the route direction to north due to the only one vacant in north. Sim-ilarly, the way forFig. 2(d) and (e) are as same asFig. 2(c). Only one vacancy locates at west so that walks to left to arrive destina-tion that is shown inFig. 2(e). Finally, the retrace route from des-tination to source is exhibited in Fig. 2(f). Those procedures demonstrate a signiﬁcant characteristic, that is, a link will be con-nected if the path exists. As a result, it is valuable for high complex-ity routes of SOC. On the other hand, six different inherentunconnected routing cases are exhibited in Fig. 3. In summary, the link is unconnected while no path passes from source todestination.Fig. 4presents thecomplexity effect routing algorithm(CERA) for SOC. For a given source points, destination pointdand the number of complex effectC. The proposed CERA discovers its neighbours ofsources(line 5). For each neighbours
xofs(line 6), it travels to neighbour ass
yfor eachs x(line 7). In case ofs ymeets obstacle, it changes to another direction (line 8). Otherwise, the s
ygoes to next stop and saves
yinformation to vacant class (line 9). If the s yarrives d, the route exists (line 10) and then retraces from destination tosource (line 13). In the contrary, if the vacant class does not beset, no path links from source to destination. On the basis of afore-mentioned explanations, the time complexity of CERA is O(mn)wheremis the number of lines in x-axis and nis the number of lines in y-axis.Fig. 5exhibits one of SOC designs with the complexity effect as10, 35 and 60 in the 20/C220 grids individually. The difference isthe number of obstacles amongFig. 5(a), (b) and (c) that is calcu- lated by Eq.(3). Those obstacles are randomly generated by theproposed method. By randomly generating benchmarks, we canfast simulate diverse SOC and then discover the route. For example,the CERA can fast generate another SOC with complex effect from

This study con-tributes not only fast generation but also rapid veriﬁcation which iscorresponding to route for both even more benchmarks. In com-parison with complex effect from 10 to 60, higher complexity obvi-ously results in the less paths from origin to destination. Althoughthe complex effect exacerbates the route, the CERA can discoverany existed links between source and destination no matter howthe complex effect is set. In addition, the route is the shortest paththat implies the fast execution time to be achieved.5. SimulationsFig. 7(a) to (c) separately demonstrates three SOC architectureswith a successfully completed route where the complexity is indi-vidually set as 20, 40 and 50 in the 20 /C220 grids. A successfully completed route indicates that has a path from a start point toan end point. In contrast, there are no paths to communicate fromorigin to destination. The successful recursive route detects pathsaround an origin point. Label ‘‘1” is used to point one distance fromsource. It is called one step. Next, the CERA departs from source tolabel ‘‘1” and then ﬁnd a possible vacancy around itself and run tonext stop. These steps form wave propagation from source to des-tination. From the viewpoint of the distance of route, Fig. 7(a), (b) and (c) are separately cost 15, 37 and 24 steps from origin and des-tination. On the other hand,Fig. 7(d) shows the CERA stops step-ping at label ‘‘1” in north and label ‘‘2” in south. Besides, theCERA stops stepping at label ‘‘4” in southeast and label ‘‘8” innorthwest due to no paths.Table 1shows that the experimental results of the CERAmethod with complex effect set as 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 in the20/C220 grids. Each set consists of 30 test benchmarks named c1,c2, c3 to c30. Each benchmark simulates a SOC with various obsta-cles from origin to destination. Those obstacles are randomly gen-

Due to the blocking locations cannot be pre-dicted, the ability of the CERA can be effectively measured. Label‘‘Y” represents that the CERA completes route from source to des-tination. In the contrary, label ‘‘–” denotes unconnected from originto target. The ‘‘Avg” column shows that the ratio is 100%, 86.7%,76.6%, 43.3% and 20% which obviously demonstrates a decreasedtrend due to available paths are less and less.Table 2shows the stepping propagation of experimental results.First, in the Complex set 20, each benchmark is successfully com-pleted and routed via various steps. In the Complex set 30, thebenchmarks of c5, c19, c23 and c25 are unable to link from sourceto destination because there are no paths. Their layouts are showninFig. 8. On the other hand, other benchmarks such as c7, c8, c13and c27 successfully depart from source to destination that isdemonstrated inFig. 9. Thirdly, in the Complex set 40, there areno any paths in c1, c3, c4, c5, c13, c14 and c15 which are partlyshown inFig. 10. In the contrast, there are 23 benchmarks withcompleted route such as c2, c8, c20 and c26 that are illustratedinFig. 11. For the Complex set 50, more spaces are used to placedigital circuit and cause that the usable paths are decreased. Thus,(a) Complex effect as 10 (b) Complex effect as 35 (c) Complex effect as 60

Fan / Applied Computing and Informatics 15 (2019) 144–152 149erates a set of obstacles which depends on the complex effect. First,in the Complex set 20, all benchmarks have successfully completedrouting by CERA method. In the Complex set 30, c33, c38 and c47are routed incompletely unless circuit placement is adjusted.Thirdly, in the Complex set 40, the routing completion and incom-pletion is separately 13 and 17 designs. In the Complex set 50,there are 22 in total benchmarks without path between sourceand destination. On the other hand, the CERA approach completes8 benchmarks which are partly shown in Fig. 16. Finally, in the Complex set 60, only four layouts have been routed which arepartly shown inFig. 17. The ‘‘Avg” column points the ratio is100%, 90%, 43.3%, 26.7% and 13.3% which shows a decreased trendowing to the blocking obstacles are more and more.Table 4shows the number of steps of experimental results. TocomparisonTable 4withTable 2, more steps are needed in 40/C2 40 grids. This phenomenon is caused by more candidates and thelonger distance between origin and destination. Not only distancebut also path is key factors in route. First, in the Complex set 20,the shortest and the longest steps are 15 and 54 individually. Itis caused that the former is near than the latter for source and des-tination. In the Complex set 30, the shortest and the longest stepsare c45 and c37 benchmarks that separately cost 3 and 70 steps.Thirdly, in the Complex set 40, c49 has the shortest routed due thatthe location of origin and destination is the nearest among bench-marks. In contrast, c37 has the longest path that is shown in Fig. 18 (a). For unconnected benchmarks such as c33, it stops stepping at(a) c16 layout (b) c20 layout (c) c24 layout (d) c27 layout

In the Complex set 50 and 60, more spaces are used by digital circuit result in less pathsthan the Complex set 40. On the basis of those results, the route ofhigh complexity SOC becomes more and more difﬁcult in thefuture.6. ConclusionThis work presents a fast routing veriﬁcation with complex-ity effect approach that is based on the algorithm of Lee. Itcan be applied to evaluate various layouts in SOC. Once allmodules are determined their placements in SOC, the CERAperforms the routing scheme from origin to destination. Theresult may be either successfully completed route or discon-nected. The former report is useful for designers to furtherconsider of delay and driver issue. In the contrary, the latterpoints the stop stepping from origin to destination to helpdesigners to adjust placement. In order to demonstrate theeffectiveness of the CERA, we conduct ﬁve complex sets exper-iments in 20/C220 and 40/C240 grids. Experimental resultsshow that the CERA achieves fast routing veriﬁcation for diver-sity architectures in SOC.(b) c41 layout (b) c49 layout
