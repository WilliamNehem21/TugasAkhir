The aim of this research is to study, monitor, mapping, planning, distribute and locate Government PHCCsin the selected study area. This information is to be held on a database. The paper also focuses onfollowing-up supply and demand in PHCCs; managing various health care (HC) facilities in accordanceto the criteria and standards of Ministry of Health and Population (MOHP) on the integration of remotesensing data and geographic information system GIS from geographic and HC view, for the best treatmentservice. El-Salam medical region, Cairo, Egypt has been selected as a study area to perform this research.It is a densely populated urban area. The proposed methodology involved many procedures, based onusing satellite images, GIS, demographic, health data and ﬁeld data. The obtained results showed thatthere was shortage in PHC centers in the selected study area. This shortage is more theoretical than prac-tical, as the research concluded that there are many other governorate and private health service, whichshould be studied in details./C2112017 The Authors.

1. IntroductionHealth is a prerequisite for all mankind. Indeed, it is a criticalcomponent of individuals’ social needs. Equal access to primaryhealthcare services for low socioeconomic groups is an aim forgovernments to meet social justice policy agenda. In response tothis policy agenda, governments’ investments give priority formonitoring and evaluating health care services (HCS) [1]. PHCCs are an approach to health beyond the traditional HC system thatfocuses on health equity-producing social policy (World HealthOrganization. Declaration of Alma-Ata, Adopted at the Interna-tional Conference on PHCCs[2]. A health system deﬁned as a struc-tured group of resources, actors and institutions according to theﬁnancing, regulation and provision of health actions that provideHC to a given population. Health services in Egypt have a highlypluralistic HC, with many public and private providers.The Egyptian HC faces multiple challenges in improving andensuring the health and wellbeing of the Egyptian citizens. Thegrowth of population with a longer life expectancy leads to thepopulation pressure on the health system. Lack of full knowledgeand awareness of duties and responsibilities leads to a feeling offrustration and aggression or oppositely reluctance towards what-ever the individual is performing. The PHC system main aims are tooptimize the health status of an entire population throughout thelife cycle.Primary care concentrated on the patient and considers alldeterminants of health. Primary care addresses most importantissues in the community by providing preventive, curative andrehabilitative services. In Egypt, PHC centers are considered oneof the vital support systems for effective high-quality health ser-vices[3].The collection of information and the necessary data about PHCcenters is to in hence the HC and to provide a plan for monitoringthe change. PHCS constructed as needed without sustainabledevelopment plans using the traditional methods. Usually, thelocations of the PHC centers selected on the available location ofthe state lands does not take into consideration the raped growthof urban areas and population. Within the health sector, the PHCCshave been an area of researches.This includes: what PHC services should be offered, how PHCcan linked via referral mechanisms to other levels of care and a

vision of health in its social context [4]. The World Health Organi- zation (WHO) is a specialized agency of the United Nations (UN)that is concerned with international public health. It was estab-lished on 7 April 1948 in Geneva, Switzerland. WHO is a memberof the UN development group? Declaration of the internationalconference on PHCCs meeting in Aima-Ata on 13/9/1978 express-ing the need for urgent action by all governments n, all healthand developments workers, and the world community to projectand promote the health of the of all the people of the world [5]. PHCCs includes all services such as income, housing, education,and environment.Primary care is the element within PHCCs that focuses on HCS,including health promotion, illness and injury prevention, and thediagnosis and treatment of illness and injury, advocacy and com-munity development. International standards and guidelines areused to check HCS are based on two points which are; a PHCCs unitshould serve a certain number of persons and a PHC should coveran area of a certain radius. The MOHP in Egypt considers the inter-national guidelines within the international standards.In PHC centers there is a need of many continuing medical edu-cation, local and international manuals, workshops, and seminarson how to make use of these guidelines would improve doctors’performance[6]. In Egypt the period from 2006 to 2011 has beenaccredited PHC centers at 2006 PHC centers was 837 unit and at2011 was 2159 unit[7].Fig. 1shows accredited PHC centers From(2006–2011). A study has been performed to evaluate the perfor-mance of PHCCs in Nigeria and also to highlight the managementto draw lessons for other actors in the health sector [8]. The PHCCs Program in USA, the Texas Department of StateHealth serves women, children, and men whose income is at orbelow 200% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) and who are unableto access the same care through insurance or other programs [9].I n Malaysia, they control, monitor and systematically plan the rapiddevelopment of the town due to the increase in the populationand economic growth to face the uncontrolled planning process.The ﬁndings showed the implementation of GIS in town planningcan improve the result based on quality of town planning processfor saving time and costs and data can be obtained faster [10]. Many researchers concluded that the use of electronic medicalrecords was functionally aiming to ensure the applicability andconvenience of the medical record and optimizing HCS introducedto our patients[11,12].Since the successful launch of satellites with very high resolu-tion sensors such as IKONOS-II with 1 m resolution and QuickBirdwith 0.61 m resolution, many researchers have considered them aspossible substitutes of the traditional airborne aerial photos usedfor producing large scale maps and in many applications [13–15]. Also, the increase in the availability of GIS in governmental healthorganizations, together with the proliferation of spatially disaggre-gate data led to a number of researches focused on developingmeasures of access to HCS[16]. This research is carried outtowards integration of remote sensing and GIS to manage PHCCsand health planners and decision makers can use continuesadvanced remote sensing to manage various HC facilities in allﬁelds of knowledge.The main objectives of this research is to present a methodologyto analysis the information from different sources as application toa particular case applied on El-Salam Awel Medical Region, Cairo,Egypt. To manage, evaluate, study, calculate served/un-served cit-izens and area supply/demand of PHC centers, analysis the geo-graphic distribution and locations of governmental PHCCs and forthe purpose of improving the health services.2. Guidelines and standards of PHC centersThe MOHP in Egypt considers the international guidelineswithin the international standards. A PHC unit in Egypt shouldserve 20,000 persons and area of 2.5 km radius [3]. Also, According to the rules of Egyptian MOHP: (1) the area of PHC unit should notbe more than 1200 square meters. (2) The construction of PHCCsmust be on land owned by the state or an area of ??land donatedby the citizens. This donation must accepted by the ofﬁcials ofthe MOHP. As example, in Emirate of Dubai, one health center orclinic served 30,000 individuals[17].3. Levels of health in EgyptLevels of Health Care in Egypt[18,19]:

Study areaThe study was conducted in 8 PHCCs related to El-Salam med-ical Region, MOHP, Cairo Governorate.These 8 PHCCs are located in El-Salam El-Shakia, El-Salam El-Gharbia, Barket El-Nasr El-Shakia and Barket El-Nasr El-Gharbiaaccording to the administration border. 8 PHC centers named; El-Salam Awel, El-Salam Than, El-Delta, El–Abd, El-Sad El-Ali, El–Hir-afeen, El-Toriki and Sder El-Salam. Also, El-Salam hospital locatedin the same selected study area as a high level of health service.El-Salam Awel medical region located in the study area, it controlsall of the activities of the PHC centers either medical or non-medical. It is characterized with densely urban and populated area,low level income and considered as sprawl area. Fig. 2shows loca- tion map of the study area.

Data collectionThe following data have been collected: Administration bordersaccording to central agency for public mobilization and statisticsCAPMS[20]; Satellite data: Very high resolution satellite Dubi-sat2 image; Ground Control Points GCPs and check points CPshas been collected using GPS; Clinic data: from records and ﬁeld;ﬁnally Demographic or population data: from census and fromlocal records[21].Table 1shows administration borders and census data (popula-tion), El-Shiakha of Qism El-Salam at 2006.6. MethodologyThe proposed methodology at beginning stage is based on sim-plicity and to be applicable to serve the different health ﬁelds. Inthe upcoming stages, the method will rely on advanced techniquesin remote sensing science, computer science and population pre-diction will based on different models such as exponential modelsand census data. The following steps have been proposed: Data col-lection (satellite images, maps, administration borders) coveringthe study area; Acquisition of GCPs, CPs and location of PHC usingHandheld GPS from ﬁeld; Pre-processing of satellite images; Regis-tration satellite image; Accuracy assessment of rectiﬁed satelliteimage registration based on RMS; Image subset; Database designof PHC centers should includes types of clinics, labs, staff, medicalfacilities and others; Distribution and locations of governmentPHCCs. Producing vectors layers; Projecting of population to2015; Calculating supply of PHC centers; Applying internationaland Egypt guidelines of PHC centers; Calculating demand of PHCcenters and served/un-served citizens and area; And evaluate theresults.7. ResultsProposed methodology applied step by step. Pre-processing ofsatellite images carried out to overcome the distortions due tothe earth curvature, relief displacement and the acquisition geom-etry of the satellites (i.e. variations in altitude, aspect, velocity,panoramic distortion). Well deﬁned GCPs has been collected fromGPS measurements to register the QuickBird image using secondorder polynomial function. Accuracy assessment of the producedgeo-images has been done based on the total RMS on easting andnorthing. The results showed that the produced rectiﬁed imagemeet map scale 1:5000.Based on clinic data: from rectiﬁed image, records and ﬁeld.PHC centers provide medical examination and treatment servicesat different clinics for a nominal fees of one Egyptian pound andfree fees for vaccination. Generally PHCC clinics includes Internalmedicine; Gynecology; Ante natal care; Pediatrics; Dental; Vacci-nation; Emergency; Delivery; Family planning; Laboratory andPharmacy. PHC Sader El-Salam center provide only chest clinic,X-ray and treatment.Vector map has been produced Administration border of thestudy area and geographical distribution of PHC centers ( Fig. 3). The results showed that good geographical distribution of 4PHC centers (El-Salam Awel, El-Salam Than, El- Sad Ali and El –Hir-afeen) relative to each others over the study area. Also, the resultsshowed bad geographical distribution of 4 PHC centers (Sader ElSalam, El Delta, El–Abd and El-Toriki|) where the distance betweenPHC Sader El Salam and PHC El Delta is 165 m and the distancebetween PHC El–Abd and PHC El-Toriki is 228 m. Main conceptof PHCC is easy accessibility of patients to them by walking. Theaccessibility of the different PHC centers mainly depends on thelocation of the center relative to the home of the patient and pov-erty level. The poverty line is deﬁned as the minimum incomedeemed adequate for an individual to meet his basic needs.According to CAPMAS 27.8 percent of Egyptian population livesbelow poverty line. The CAPMAS survey pointed out that the urbanpopulation poverty line in Cairo differs from one area to anotherdepending on the prices of apartments and living in each area.Urban areas in Cairo witnessed increased levels of inequality andpoverty during the last two years.Most of PHCC are located in main road where there was publictransportation. The road network in El-Salam urban area consistsof two types of roads paved and unpaved roads. Paved roads aredesigned to carry buses and cars. Unpaved roads are narrow roadsused by citizens to access to their apartments. Access to any healthcenter will be through various ways such as walking, public trans-portation, Taxi and private cars to the nearest point to the locationof the center. Public transportation move only in main road.

Toktok move in narrow roadsfor 5 Egyptian pounds. PHCC El-Sad Ali has been taken as exampleto explain access to it. There is a Railway considers as an obstaclesfor patients to move from side to another side where PHCC El-SadAli exists.Fig. 4shows example of enlarged road network - PHC SadAli extracted from rectiﬁed image.Database has been designed, it included attribute data of PHCcenter such as Name, area, address, telephone, date of construction,different type of clinics, were maintained in different ﬁelds.Administration borders and serviced area by each PHC center arerepresented with the polygon. Also, location of PHC center hasbeen presented by point data type in the database ( Table 2). Population has been projected from 2006 to 2015 based on cen-sus data using average growth rate of population per year. Popula-tion at 2006 was 440,444 Capita and average growth rate/year was2% in Cairo governorate according to the Central Agency for PublicMobilization and Statistics[21]. Hence, predicted population 2015was 519,723 Capita.Demand of PHCCs has been calculated based on guidelines andstandards of Egyptian MOHP. There were two criteria: (1) PHC cen-ter should serve 20,000 Capita: Results showed that total numberof un-serviced population 359,723 Capita, so required number ofPHC = 18 centers to achieve criteria number 1. (2) Area coveredby circle 2.5 km radius (Fig. 5): Results showed that according tocriteria 2 required number of PHC = 2 centers. Hence, there is notdeﬁcit in the number of health centers. The ﬁnal conclusions thedeﬁcit on PHC centers is mainly related to total number ofpopulation.The total area of the selected study area is approximately ser-viced. At year 2015 theoretically un-serviced population = 359,723 Capita, which represent 81.7% of the total number of population.Hence, the required numbers of PHC centers to cover the shortageare 18 centers according to the criteria of Egyptian MOHP.To construct a new PHCC the situation has been studied andreported that there is no piece of land in the range of area = 1200m
2that belongs to the state inside the study area. So, the solutionis searching for donators to solve the problem or re-plan and re-allocation of state lands. The shortage in the number of PHCC ismore theoretical than practical due to the study explored thatthere are many other governorate and private health services.The Governorate health services such as public hospital and heathinsurance clinics. Private health services such as private hospitalsand private clinics.The directors of the centers, there is a pressure from the audi-tors on the centers that can be avoided by developing the centers,especially by increasing the number of clinics and by working extrahours or two shifts. MOHP needs further steps in planning for newPHC facilities considering changes in the MOHP guidelines anduses development in knowledge and sciences when planningupcoming PHC centers.Many researchers concluded that the use of electronic medicalrecords was functionally aiming to ensure the applicability andconvenience of the medical record and optimizing HCS introducedto our patients such as in Dubai[16]. PHCCs could be very different depending on the organization of the system. All mentioned solu-tion should be taken into consideration and studied in details inthe next researches.

ConclusionsTraditional method is not capable dynamically to mange PHCcenters and it is costly and time consuming. The obtained resultshowed that health planners and decision makers can use contin-ues advanced ﬁelds of knowledge’s such as remote sensing, GISand computer science in studying, monitoring, mapping, planning,following-up supply and demand in PHCCs to manage various HCfacilities according to the criteria and standards of MOHP of Egypt.The study found that the population is considered as the active cri-teria due to the high population growth. Theoretically, the PHCcenters cover the serviced area but it doesn’t cover the servicedpopulation according to the criteria of Egyptian MOHP. Moreover,the study explored that there are many other governmental andprivate health services that were used by some patients insteadof PHC centers. So, this point should be taken into considerationin the next study.AcknowledgementThe Authors gratefully thanks and acknowledge the Reviewersof the manuscripts for their valuable comments.References
