Article history:Received 19 November 2021Received in revised form 9 September 2022Accepted 11 September 2022Available online 19 September 2022A reliable and accurate forecasting model for crop yields is crucial for effective decision-making in every agricul-tural sector. Machine learning approaches allow for building such predictive models, but the quality of predic-tions decreases if data is scarce. In this work, we proposed data-augmentation for wheat yield forecasting inthe presence of small data sets of two distinct Provinces in Algeria. We ﬁrst increased the dimension of each data set by adding more features, and then we augmented the size of the data by merging the two data sets.To assess the effectiveness of data-augmentation approaches, we conducted three sets of experiments basedon three data sets: the primary data sets, data sets with additional features and the augmented data sets obtainedby merging, usingﬁve regression models (Support Vector Regression, Random Forest, Extreme LearningMachine, Artiﬁcial Neural Network, Deep Neural Network). To evaluate the models, we used cross-validation;the results showed an overall increase in performance with the augmented data. DNN outperformed the othermodels for theﬁrst Province with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.04 q/ha and R_Squared ( R
2) of 0.96, whereas the Random Forest outperformed the other models for the second Province with RMSE of 0.05 q/ha.The data-augmentation approach proposed in this study showed encouraging results.© 2022 The Author.

1. IntroductionThe estimation of crop yield is a crucial task for decision-makers as itenables efﬁcient planning of resources (Chergui et al., 2020;Gyamerah et al., 2020;Kim et al., 2019). Economically, yield prediction can helpdecision-makers react in the right way on how much to export in thecase of a surplus or make early decisions about quantities, contracts,agreements and planning of imports in the case of shortage. It can alsohelp determine the optimal proﬁle of crops to plant and appropriatelyallocate government resources. On the other hand, it can help farmersdecide on what and when to grow and plan their harvest and storage(Chergui et al., 2020). Besides, cereals are considered the most impor-tant crops in Algeria and play a crucial role in maintaining the food sup-ply. According to ofﬁcial reports, the estimated need of Algeria forcereals is around 15 million tons per year. In 2019, production for theharvest season was estimated at 6 million tons, while it imported nearly12 million tons. Consequently, timely and accurate yield information isfateful to decision-makers and sustainable developments. Moreover,crop yield prediction permits studying factors that in ﬂuence and affect production, such as climate and weather, irrigation and fertilisationpractices, agricultural policies, etc.Advanced information and communication technologies haveemerged together with machine learning (ML) to create new opportu-nities to understand processes in agricultural systems where cropyield prediction is one of their crucial tasks that consists of severalcomplicated steps. ML is a practical approach that can provide betteryield prediction based on several features ( Klompenburg et al., 2020); ML can determine patterns and correlations and discover knowledgefrom data sets. (Klompenburg et al., 2020) present a systematic review of the literature on crop yield prediction using ML techniques, where itextracts the major ML algorithms, features and evaluation metrics usedfor this task. Several models from traditional ML models ( Gyamerah et al., 2020;Guo et al., 2021;Shahhosseini et al., 2020) to complex deep learning (DL) models (Alibabaei et al., 2021;Shook et al., 2021; Schwalbert et al., 2020;Wolanin et al., 2020;You et al., 2017) have been successfully developed and proven their ef ﬁciency. However, a good and powerful ML model requires equally good dataquality to generate quality predictions, where the data quality can beaffected by two factors, impurities and size. In our case, regrettably,directorates and agricultural services in Algeria became aware of the im-portance of recording the farming data, farmers' knowledge andpractices (including seeding, irrigation, fertilisation, soil components,etc.), and their signiﬁcant role in enhancing the production and foodsustainability till the last few years. Therefore, the prediction processin such a situation is challenging.Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 6 (2022) 156 –166

While one possible solution to solve the problemof small data sets is data augmentation. This latter includes techniquesof increasing training data diversity without explicitly collecting newdata (Feng et al., 2021), in an attempt to improve the generalisationability of training models. For real-world data, generalisation is signi ﬁ- cant because it can help networks overcome small data sets ( Olson et al., 2018), and it is used to regularise and reduce over- ﬁtting when training ML models (Shorten and Khoshgoftaar, 2019). The most widely used data augmentation techniques involve either adding slightly mod-iﬁed copies of existing data or creating synthetic ones ( Shorten and Khoshgoftaar, 2019).Several artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) applications apply data augmenta-tion in the case of small training data. In computer vision and patternrecognition for generating more labelled data, where techniques likecropping,ﬂipping, and colour jittering are standard components ofmodel training (Feng et al., 2021). In natural language processing(NLP), in this case, techniques of interpolation and rule-based areapplied to augment patterns (Feng et al., 2021). In addition to time se- ries classiﬁcation based on techniques of random transformation(Iwana and Uchida, 2021).Agricultural applications based on computer vision like crop classi ﬁ- cation, diseases and weed detection also used data augmentation basedon techniques to artiﬁcially increase the number of images in handbased on ideas of (rotation, light shade's variation, colour inversion,translation, improving the resolution and changes in intensity and soon) (Arsenovic et al., 2019;Aravind and Raja, 2020;Chen et al., 2019; Kamal et al., 2019;Liu et al., 2017;Sladojevic et al., 2016;Yamamoto et al., 2017). Yet, this solution is not applicable to crop yield forecasting.Transfer learning is another alternative solution for increasing smalldata set, where the knowledge obtained from solving a task in a givendomain is transferred to the target domain ( Aravind and Raja, 2020; Barbedo, 2018;Cruz et al., 2017;Wang et al., 2018). But, this solution can be effective if the source and target domains share certain similari-ties; and if we initially have a good model for the source domain, whichis not always possible.In this work, we address the problem of crop yield forecasting andthe performance of ML methods in the presence of small data setswhere we use data augmentation techniques to increase the data setsand enhance the performance of ML models. In which we conduct acomparative study using ML regression models, such as Support VectorRegression (SVR), Random Forest regression (RF), Arti ﬁcial Neural Network (ANN), Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and Deep NeuralNetwork (DNN), under three experimental scenarios by evaluating theperformances achieved by the different methods.2. Related worksML and DL techniques are of increased use to estimate different cropyields. (Elavarasan et al., 2018
) discuss the yield estimation by integrat-ing agrarian factors in ML techniques. Besides, several works have beenproposed to estimate crop yield using ML ( Abbas et al., 2020;Guo et al., 2021;Ji et al., 2021;Piekutowska et al., 2021;Rahman and Robson, 2020;Rezapour et al., 2021;Shahhosseini et al., 2020;Xu et al., 2020) and others have been used DL models ( Alibabaei et al., 2021;Cao et al., 2021;Gong et al., 2021;Nevavuori et al., 2020;Shook et al., 2021;Schwalbert et al., 2020).(Chergui et al., 2020) demonstrate possible applications of ML andDL for crop management, including crop yield forecasting. They distin-guish two trends for crop estimation; the ﬁrst one is related to data sources that directly affect the crops(soil data, weather data, environ-mental parameter data). These are typically used to offer a pre-seasonestimate of crop yield (Crane-Droesch, 2018;Ehret et al., 2011; Fukuda et al., 2013;Gonzalez-Sanchez et al., 2014;Gyamerah et al., 2020;Kouadio et al., 2018). The second trend is related to the datasources' collected using advanced technologies and tools such asmulti-spectral and hyper-spectral satellite images, remote sensing andsensors. These are usually applied to provide in-season predictions ofcrop yields (Ji et al., 2017;Maimaitijiang et al., 2020;Pantazi et al., 2016;You et al., 2017). Where other studies use both types of datasources (Abbas et al., 2020;Filippi et al., 2019;Han et al., 2020;Jeong et al., 2016;Kim et al., 2019;Kamir et al., 2020;Oliveira et al., 2018; Schwalbert et al., 2020;Sakamoto, 2020).Other proposed studies used data augmentation via the aggregationof different small data sets for crop yield forecasting. Among others, wefound the work of (Meroni et al., 2021) which predicted the monthly yield of three types of cereals at the national level, where it integrateddata sets by crop from all provinces and added an identi ﬁer for eachProvince as an additional predictor variable. ( Filippi et al., 2019) com- bined data on three types of cereals over multiple ﬁelds and years into one data set. Then they created three separate models based on factorslike (pre-sowing, mid-season and late-season conditions); to study theeffect of the availability of within-season information on the predictiveability of their models. They created a single model for the three cropsand included the crop type as a predictor variable. In our study, we inte-grate small data sets from two Provinces to form a more considerablebase for training. Rather than creating a single predictor for the twoProvinces, we seek to construct a speciﬁc predictor for each one that better corresponds to its speciﬁcity.InTable 1, we resume and compare recent works on forecasting cropyield, where we focus on theﬁrst trend that used to offer a pre-seasonestimate of crop yield.3. Material and methods3.1. Region and crop selectionThe study was carried out in two sites: the Province of Constantineand the Province of Setif 1 (seeFig. 1). Constantine is located in the northeast of Algeria; at latitude: 36.2833 and Longitude: 6.61667, 36
∘
16′60”North and 6∘37′0″East, and it has a Mediterranean climate.Setif's latitude: 36.15 and longitude: 5.43333, 36
∘11′28.03”North and 5
∘24′49.43″East, it has a semi-arid climate.These regions are known for the cultivation of cereals. The crop cho-sen for this study is durum wheat because it presents the most impor-tant crop and occupies the amplest agricultural area. The croppedwheat in both regions is rainfed or not irrigated.3.2. Data sourcesWe have obtained historical data on durum wheat yields from theDepartment of Agricultural Services of the Province of Constantine
1
and the Province of Setif,2data is not available online. The yield data ob-tained for the Province of Constantine covers the seasons from 1991 to2019 and starting from 2005 to 2020 for the Province of Setif. The twodata sets contain information on the recorded annual yields and theacreage; they present the crop yield as the harvested production of acrop per unit of the harvested area, measured in metric quintals perhectare (q/ha). However, they do not provide information on geo-graphic identiﬁcation, soil nature and components or fertilisation pro-grams.Additionally, we used climatic data obtained from different sources,initially from the principal used source,
3that archives meteorological data at airports of the provinces of Constantine and Setif. However,this site offers downloadable data only from February 2005; therefore,we have got the weather data from 2005 to 1996 from a second source.

157Due to the scarcity of meteorological data for the pre-1996 period,we have reduced the study interval for the province of Constantinefrom 1996 to 2019.The climatic data from theﬁrst source is rich and downloadable; itoffers daily-level records (at least three records per day). The secondsource provides data from 1945 at the daily level, but it was hard toreuse because it was not downloadable. Additionally, it includes only afew features (air temperature, precipitation, wind and pressure); it con-tains missing records for a few months. Thence, we selected attributesin common between the two data sources (the monthly mean temper-ature and the monthly mean precipitation) as predictor variables fromNovember to June for each year. It exists a national climate centre thatprovides more detailed data and includes more expanded informationon solar radiation, humidity, pressure, wind, etc. Because of the absenceof agreements between the institutions, this data was helpless.We used a third data source
5for the following purposes: to completethe data for the missing months and to extract the relative air humidityfor the period before February 2005 to construct the data set used forthe second experiment. Data from this source is not directly download-able.Durum wheat is sown in autumn (from late October to November,subject to autumn rainfall); harvesting acquires at the beginning ofsummer (from June to July). Therefore, we collected climatic datafrom November to May.3.3. Data pre-processingThe historical yield data was complete with no missing data.We obtained climatic data from different sources; therefore, we ﬁrst extracted all the needed features and transformed them into a singleform. Next, we cleaned up the data from some redundant records.Then, we imputed the rest of the missing records by using the medianapproach. After that, we gathered and calculated the monthly meansof temperature, precipitation and relative humidity.Later, we calculated the standard deviation (SD) of the yield time se-ries in each zone and then deﬁned the observed values as outliers andremoved them if they were not within the range of ±3SD.Finally, we normalised the data and deﬁned it into an identical scale in the interval [0,1] using the min_max normalisation function.3.4. AI models and evaluation metricsTo investigate how the data augmentation approach proposed inthis work can improve the accuracy of yield prediction, we conduct acomprehensive set of experiments using the main types of AI regressionmodels for crop yield modelling. Based on the study by ( Klompenburg et al., 2020), which claimed that neural networks were the most usedand accurate tools for crop yield estimation, we selected the ExtremeLearning Machine (ELM), Artiﬁcial Neural Network (ANN) and DeepNeural Network (DNN) as predictive models. In addition, we also testthe accuracy of the approach using some algorithms commonly usedfor small data set: Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Regression(SVR) (SeeTable 2).We adjusted the hyper-parameters of each model by experiments;the properties of neural network models like their structure, learningrate and activation functions, in addition to those of RF and SVR.Finally, we normalised the data and deﬁned it into an identical scale in the interval [0, 1] using the min_max normalisation function.Root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error(MAPE), coefﬁcient of determination (R-squared or R
2), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean biased error (MBE) were the statistical parame-ters used for evaluating the accuracy of the forecast.Table 1ML approaches for crop yield estimation.Ref Crop type Algo Evaluation metricsData type Extracted features ResultsShahhosseiniet al.

Therefore,forecasting crop yield using small data sets may not achieve highaccuracy.After pre-processing the data, we obtained a data set containing 23samples for the Province of Constantine and 14 samples for the Provinceof Setif.We are going to conduct three experiments under three differentdata sets where the component of each one is as follows:•Weﬁrst refer by data-sets1, data-sets2 and data-sets3 to the datasets used respectively for experiment1, experiment2 and experiment3;•We respectively refer by (data-set1A, zone-A) and (data-set1B,zone-B) to the Province of Constantine and its data and the Provinceof Setif and its data. Both data sets contain the mean monthly precipita-tion and the mean monthly temperature;•Data-sets2 used for experiment2 is the data-sets1 enhanced byan additional feature (the relative humidity) to improve the prediction'saccuracy byﬁrst adding a new feature to data-sets. We built data-set2Afor zone-A and data-set2B for zone-B;•In experiment3, we merged data-set2A with data-set2B to builddata-set3 (data-set3A for zone-A and data-set3B for zone-B), the merg-ing process will be discussed later (see Fig. 2). We divided data sets into training data (70%) and test data (30%).We chose this partition to obtain more cases to test the generation abil-ity of the ML algorithms, therefore, to get more accurate results becausetoo little test data can lead to an optimistic estimation of the model'sperformance. Then, we used three-fold cross-validation to train theML algorithms.3.5.1. Data augmentation through merging of data setsTo increase the performance of models' predictions when only smalldata sets are available, we augment raw versions of data-sets2 (withhumidity) used to train/test ML algorithms for the two zones (A andB) by merging them to build a larger one (data-set3).Then, we pre-processed the resulting data set (data-set3) by remov-ing the outlier using ±3SD. After that, we normalise it using themin-max function.To get a more transparent comparison between the threeexperiments, we keep the same test sets used for experiment1 and ex-periment2. Therefore, we split data-set3 into three subsets: test-setA forzone-A, test-setB for zone-B and train-setAB, and the training set for thetwo zones, which means that we exclude test-setA and test-setB fromtrain-setAB.

159Cross-validation is applied to train ML algorithms. To train modelsfor zone-A, we exclude the validation records of zone-B from its trainingset and the same for training zone-B. In another sense, we adjust thelearning of the ML algorithm according to the target zone. Fig. 2presents the data augmentation process.4. Results and discussions4.1. ResultsAfter implementing the ML models in Python using existing librarieslike the Scikit-Learn library, we obtained the results presented in Table 3where the text in bold font indicates the best results for each metric ineach experiment. Generally observed, each of the regression methods:ANN, DNN, ELM, RF and SVR, exhibited better performance for experi-ment3 over the two other experiments for both zones in most cases.Besides, they also showed better-to-comparable performance withexperiment2 and experiment1, while experiment2 (data with the addi-tional feature) was favourable. Algorithms known to perform well withlarger data sets (ANN, DNN, RF, ELM) performed very well with exper-iment3 for both zones. However, SVR showed weaknesses ingeneralising high-quality estimates for all three experiments, especiallyfor experiment3 (zone-A). It is because SVR does not perform well withhigh-dimensional data sets.Table 2Summary of the main features, strengths and weaknesses of AI models used in this study.Algo features Strengths WeaknessesANN A network model consisting of input hidden andoutput layers based on the back-propagation Performs well with larger data sets Suffers from local minima problem Hard to determine the proper network structure.

160Furthermore, the best performance for durum wheat yieldprediction was observed when using augmented data (experiment3)for both zones, achieving a (RMSE = 0.037 q/ha, MAPE = 5.9%, R
2= 0.965) with DNN algorithm for zone A, and a (RMSE = 0.051 q/ha,MAPE = 24.879%,R
2= 0.835) with RF for zone-B, as shown in Table 3. On the other hand, when increasing the number of input features(experiment2), the evaluation metrics gradually improved (RMSE,MAPE, MAE, MBE,R
2) for almost all methods, especially for zone-B.Indicates that all tested regression methods, to some extent, were ableto beneﬁt from the additional input feature. In addition, the relativehumidity feature has helped improve the prediction accuracy in manycases.However, ML methods such as ANN, RF and ELM outperformed DNNregression when fewer input variables were available (experiment1and experiment2). Conversely, DNN achieved higher performancethan other methods when a more signiﬁcant number of input variables were available (augmented data of experiment3). It is because deeplearning often goes beyond ordinary machine learning models for largerdata sets (Maimaitijiang et al., 2020).Bar chart that visualises performance of the evaluation metrics(RMSE, MAPE,R
2,M A Ea n dM B E )o ft h eﬁve methods using the test data are given inFig. 3for zone-A, andFig. 4for zone-B. When predicting the yield of durum wheat using data sets of experiment1,comparative to theﬁve benchmark methods, it is evident that forzone-A, ELM performed better in terms of RMSE, MAPE, MAE and R
2. Yet RF outperformed all the other models in terms of all metrics forzone-B.Moreover, we can observe that ANN, DNN and ELM performed verywell concerning all evaluation metrics when predicting the durumwheat yield using data-set3A from experiment3 compared to RF andSVR. In addition, we perceive that for zone-B, almost all methodsreached a high level of precision for RMSE, MAE, MBE and R
2(except the DNN showed a bit of degradation with R
2). RF outperformed other methods in RMSE,R
2and MAE, while DNN surpassed them in MAPEand MBE.On the other side, if we take the MBE metric that explains the aver-age amount by which the observation is greater than the prediction, andallows us to see how much the model overestimates or underestimates.We can perceive that the DNN model outperformed all the other modelsfor both zones. Also, there is an improvement in the value of MBE froman underestimation in experiment1 to a slight overestimation in exper-iment2. Besides, it reached a neglected level in experiment3 for bothzones, indicating that the DNN model in experiment3 for both zones isnot biased. If we look at an overview of all evaluation metrics; we canobserve that using data-set2A from experiment2 (with the additionalfeature) does not improve the prediction accuracy for zone-A comparedto experiment1 regarding ANN and SVR methods, where DNN recordedbetter performances but still exceeded by ELM.However, for zone-B in experiment2, all methods performed betterthan those in experiment1 in terms of all metrics. RF outperformedother methods considering RMSE and MAE, and DNN performances'surpassed those of the remaining algorithms in terms of R2,M A P Ea n d MBE. This fact conducts us to understand that the impact of the relativehumidity feature is more signiﬁcant for forecasting wheat grown inzone-B (characterised by semi-arid climate) than zone-A (characterisedby Mediterranean climate).5. DiscussionsFor a clearer vision, we further investigate the relationship betweenrelative humidity and yield using the Partial Dependence Plots (PDP)along with the Individual Conditional Expectation plots (ICE) to visual-ise the marginal effect of relative humidity on yield prediction and thedependence between them for both zones.But since there is an average correlation between the relativehumidity and rainfall (knowing that correlation= 0.37 for zone-A, correlation= 0.43 for zone-B), PDP may become a misleading. Toovercome this limitation, we used the Accumulated Local Effects (ALE)plot, an unbiased model that describes how much the feature in ﬂuences the prediction of an ML model.TheFigs. 5, 6show two PDP, ICE and ALE plots for zone-A and zone-B, with a RF regressor.The PDPs inFigs. 5aa n d6a respectively depict the average effect ofthe relative humidity on the yield for zone-A and zone-B. We can ob-serve that an increase in the relative humidity increases the yieldvalue until reaching some levels where it becomes steady (from 0.55for zone-A and 0.68 for zone-B). Besides, the effect of relative humidityon zone-B is more signiﬁcant than its inﬂuence on zone-A; this is evi- dent when we look at the size of the change in the yield. Through thecurve of zone-A, we notice that the amplitude of variation is equal to0.035, which is considered negligible compared to 0.20 of zone-B.The ICE plots are presented inFigs. 5ba n d6b, in which the dashed lines in the plots correspond to the PDP line that overlaid on ICE lines(each sample of the feature has a separate line).

This indicates that relative hu-midity is more relevant for predictions of zone-B than zone-A.Figs. 5ca n d6c showed the ALE plots for zone-A and zone-B. Theseplots are zero-centred which signiﬁes the mean prediction, and thenthe value at each point of the ALE curve is the difference from thismean. The higher the difference is, the higher the effects of the featureon the yield prediction. Accordingly, we conclude that the in ﬂuence of

163relative humidity on yield prediction of zone-B is more signi ﬁcant than for zone-A.6. Limitation and perspectivesThe data augmentation approach has remarkably helped improvethe quality of predictions for many models. This fact is not due only tolarger data sets, but the latter may contain additional information andvarieties in weather conditions with different intrinsic yield potential,and this variety would be a necessary predictor variable ( Filippi et al., 2019). The drawback of this study is that we used the entire Province(an aggregation of several scatteredﬁelds and farms) without consider-ing sub-regional spatial variability (Pham et al., 2022), resulting from climatic factors, the different topography and soil nature. In addition,various farmers manage theseﬁelds following different technicalpaths for seeding, harvesting and so on. Therefore, although we didnot use most of this information in this study because of their unavail-ability, weather data taken at one station per Province are irrelevantfor someﬁelds and may affect the models' output. Therefore, if wehad accurate climate variable information and ground-truth data attheﬁeld level within each Province, we could likely get more data pointsthat would automatically increase the data set and possibly improve theaccuracy of results.Furthermore, theﬁeld-level information would allow us to useremote sensing images derived from satellite sensors like sentinel-2. Itwould make it possible to provide temperature values closer to the ac-tual one on the farm compared to the employed values, which describea sensed temperature that may be very far from several ﬁelds and farms within the same Province.On the other hand, it would permit us to use additional variables likevegetation indices which have proven their ef ﬁciency in enhancing pre- diction accuracy (Maimaitijiang et al., 2020;Abbas et al., 2020;Filippi et al., 2019;Han et al., 2020;Kim et al., 2019;Kamir et al., 2020; Oliveira et al., 2018;Schwalbert et al., 2020;Sakamoto, 2020). Another potentially obtained beneﬁt from the availability ofﬁeld- level information is the exploration of other deep learning models likeCNN for yield forecasting using the sensed images. Additionally, theexploitation of data augmentation techniques used for image classi ﬁca- tion purposes to augment the data size of samples if needed ( Arsenovic et al., 2019;Aravind and Raja, 2020). Besides, image-based deep learn-ing approaches can employ spectral, spatial, and temporal informationfrom satellite data and may reduce the need for feature engineering(Sagan et al., 2021).

ConclusionTo solve the problem of crop yield estimation in the presence of datascarcity and its impacts on forecasting quality, we conducted an ap-proach to predicting the yield of durum wheat using only two climaticvariables for two different provinces in Algeria.The method was to increase the size and dimension of the data.Firstly, we increased the dimension of the initial data by adding a newclimatic feature. Secondly, we augmented its size by merging data setsfrom the two provinces to create a more signi ﬁcant input. Next, we per- formed extensive experiments to study the effects of data size and selectthe best model, particularly to examine and test the effectiveness of thedata augmentation-by-merging approach. We carried out a comprehen-sive comparison ofﬁve major AI regression models based on the threedifferent data sets for the two provinces. Then, we proposed a cross-validation training/test process to learn algorithms to develop the bestmodel for crop yield prediction. As a result, we achieved the best perfor-mance when utilising data augmentation-by-merging data sets for bothProvinces. While the DNN model employed for the ﬁrst Province outperformed the other four AI models, the RF model outperformedthe related models for the second Province.The data augmentation approach proposed in this study has shownpromising results and can be adopted in other regions or for othercrops. In addition, the suggested method is generic, allowing it to be ap-plied to other agricultural applications or for other ﬁelds where data is scarce.Credit statementNabila CHERGUI:conceptualisation, methodology, data collectionand processing, performing the experiments, visualising the results,preparing tables and images, writing draft preparation, writing-reviewing and editing,Declaration of Competing InterestWe declare that there is no conﬂict of interest associated with thisresearch paper, and there has been noﬁnancial support for this work.AcknowledgementsThe author thanks the Constantine and Setif Agriculture Depart-ments for their cooperation and for providing us with the required dataon the durum wheat crop.References
