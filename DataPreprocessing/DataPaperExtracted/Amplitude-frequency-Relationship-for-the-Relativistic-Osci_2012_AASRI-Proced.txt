Abstract 
The Hamiltonian approach and the variational approach are utilized to treat the relativistic harmonic oscillator for the amplitude-frequency relationship. The nice reliability is shown by the result comparison with that from open literature. The simplicity and efficiency of the methods are also disclosed for different range of the initial amplitude during looking for the amplitude-frequency relationship for the nonlinear relativis tic harmonic oscillator.

where A is the initial amplitude. This is an example of a conservative nonlinear oscillatory system in which 
the restoring force has an irrational form. The relativ istic oscillator is important in physics because it is 
usually used as the basis for analyzing more complicated motion. 2. Application of the Hamiltonian approach 
      The Hamiltonian approach has been successfully used to st udy the nonlinear vibrating equations [5, 6] 
since it was discovered by Ji-huan He [4]. Here, the corresponding Hamiltonian can be easily obtained, which 
reads

3. Application of the Variational approach       Variation is one of the two basic ways to descri be a physical problem [7, 9]. Next, we apply the variational method [7, 9] to the nonlinear relativistic harmonic oscillator. The functional formulation can be constructed, which reads

Z in Eq. (13) and Eq. (15) is different in form, we know the approximation is good compared with the exact one after symbolic computation with distinct initial amplitude.
