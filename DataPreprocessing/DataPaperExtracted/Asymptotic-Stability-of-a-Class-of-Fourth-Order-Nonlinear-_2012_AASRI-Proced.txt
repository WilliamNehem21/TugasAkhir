Abstract 
In this paper, two asymptotic stability criterions of the tr ivial solutions to a class of forth order nonlinear systems are improved, and an error which exists in the proof of Theorem 2 of the paper [1] is pointed out.

Introduction Lyapunov stability is named after Aleksandr Lyapunov, a Russian mathematician who published his book "The General Problem of Stability of Motion" in 1892[1]. Lyapunov was the first to consider the modifications necessary in nonlinear systems to the linear theory of stability based on linearizing near a point of equilibrium. His work, initially published in Russian and then translated to French, received little attention

for many years. Interest in it started suddenly during  the Cold War (1953-1962) period when the so-called "Second Method of Lyapunov" was found to be applicab le to the stability of aerospace guidance systems which typically contain strong nonlinearities not treatable by other methods. A large number of publications appeared then in the control and systems literature. Mo re recently the concept of Lyapunov exponent (related to Lyapunov's First Method of discussing stability) has received wide interest in connection with chaos theory. Lyapunov stability methods have also been applied to finding equilibrium solutions in traffic assignment problems following the work by MJ Smith and MB Wisten. Various types of stability may be discussed for the so lutions of differential equations describing dynamical systems. The most important type is that concerning the stability of solutions near to a point of equilibrium. This may be discussed by the theory of Lyapunov. In simple terms, if all solutions of the dynamical system that start out near an equilibrium point 
 and stay near 
  forever, then 
  is Lyapunov stable. More strongly, if 
 is Lyapunov stable and all solutions that start out near 
  and converge to 
 , then 
 is asymptotically stable. The notion of exponential stability guarantees a minimal rate of decay, i.e., an estimate of how quickly the solutions converge. The idea of Lyapunov stability can be extended to infinite-dimensional manifolds, where it is known as structural stability, wh ich concerns the behavior of different but "nearby" solutions to differential equations. Input-to-state stabili ty (ISS) applies Lyapunov notions to systems with inputs. In thepaper[3],  Liapunov function for a fourth order linear system with constant coefficients is given by means of the Barbashinâ€™s formula, and then stability of  the trivial solutions to a class of forth order nonlinear systems is studied by applying the comparison method. But, we think it necessary to point out the following two problems: First, the two stable theorems in [2] are treaded
