The precision and accuracy of certain simulations in nanoscience, ﬂuid dynamics and biotechnology inthe analyses of boundary conditions problems with real experimental results are in general related tothe characteristics of numerical approach used and subsequently to the morphological structure of lat-tices used along these calculations. The more the lattice used approximates to the original boundaryor initial condition problem more precise the simulation would be. This work shows a simple algorithmthat can be used to build huge lattices containing the main geometrical structures statistically similar toexperimental 2D image data of ceramic grains by using some freeware software./C2112017 The Author.

1. IntroductionIn the area of nano-science, biotechnology, ﬂuid dynamics andother scientiﬁc research branches the investigation of the maincharacteristics or nature of the interactions on each system canbe developed by means of computational simulations [1–7].I n general, these approaches involve the solution of partial differen-tial equations or ordinary differential equations and a big amountof these set of equations are boundary value problems.Particulary, the matching between solution of the Dirichlet andNeumann boundary condition problems that emerge on theseanalyses and the real system are strictly correlated to the rightchoose of the lattice used to solve the differential equations [8–11]. Besides the numerical solution of differential equations thereare the stochastic models[12], classical molecular dynamics simu-lations[13]and the cellular automata modeling [14,15]that are strongly dependent on the lattice used to role the simulations.Hence, the determination of geometrical structures of these lat-tices are very important for the correct accuracy of the modelsinvestigated.One of the branches in applied physics research that requiresthe accurate description of the lattice is the analyses ofsuperconductors junctions[16,17]. At these theoretical studies,part of them developed using percolation theory [18–20], the similarity between real grains morphology and the simulated onesare suitable important. For example, the area of the grains and thelinear size of a junction can determine the behaviour of the currentdensity associated with the Cooper pairs [21–23]. The present article develops an algorithm based on freewaresoftware capable of characterize qualitatively the distributions ofarea and linear length of a grain edge per site of a scanned elec-tronic microscopy image of a ceramic material containing thegrains edges. Consequently, with all the statistical informationobtained a modiﬁed Voroni diagram algorithm is proposed toreconstruct the original grain image with great similarity anddetermine exactly the connectivity of the grains.2. Thecnique and resultsThe algorithm here proposed here is similiar to the one devel-oped by Tuan et al.[24], and is useful to deal with any kind ofsource image, otherwise, a scanned electronic microscopy imagehave a gray scale pattern of colors. Due to the quality of the originalimage used at the example here shown, modiﬁcations on the colorcontrast was performed in order to clarify the grain edges and theresulting image is represented inFig. 1. This previous processing of the image can be performed using any manipulation software, hereGIMP[25]was used.

In order to scan the ceramic image the software Imagemagick [27]was used to convert the:jpegimage ﬁle into a:txtﬁle. The out- put ﬁle obtained is a text ﬁle that contains the pixels coordinates asinteger numbers and the color associated with each pixel describedby asrgbcolor code presented in three formats being one of themthe corresponding hexadecimal format code for each kind of color.The next step of the technique is a clean-up procedure. The pix-els coordinatesði;jÞand the hexadecimal color code must beselected from the original text ﬁle, and all other symbols and infor-mation removed. Now, is possible to scan the image inside in anarrayAof integer numbers and associate a number to each colorcode.The most important color at this array is black because it wasthe color associated with the ceramic grains edges. From the pointof view of array elements, we create a 2-D vector of integer valuescalledA
n;mwith 0 to black pixels and 1 for all other kinds of colors.Here,m;nare the size in pixels of the original picture ( n/C2m) and represent the dimensions of the vector A. Computing only the black pixels the result obtained from the processing of Fig. 1is shown inFig. 2.As observed some pixels inside the ceramic grains are black, dueto the inhomogeneity of the original image. To remove part ofthese black pixels that do not belong to grain edges, a line searchacross the array considering it as a rectangular regular latticewas performed a couple of times. Along the search, each black ele-mentAi;jsurrounded by more than 3 white ﬁrst nearest neighborswas changed from 0 to 1. Given the huge number of pixels deter-mining each grain edge, the boundary of the grains was notaffected by this process.The most difﬁcult step was to determine the region/area of thearrayAthat belongs to each ceramic grain. To perform it, the arrayAcontaining only two kinds of elements 0 and 1 was scanned,going from line 1 up tomand from column 1 up ton. Every time that the forward elementA
i;jþ1–0 and the instant element A
i;j–0 or 1, then the operationA i;jþ1¼A i;jwas evaluated. Doing that, ifA
i;jþ1–0 or 1 butA i;j¼0 thenA i;jþ1¼kwherekis an integer number and is the label associated with the grain wherethe proposed pixel belongs. The determination of kmust be done

i¼0) associated with the labels of all the detected ceramic grains. If there is some elementaroundA
i;jþ1–0, or 1 thenkmust be the label associated with thisnon-zero element. On the other hand, if every element are equal to0 or 1, thenkmust be the smallestiindex of the zero elements of arrayG, and every time that search across Goccur the elementG

Unfortunately, some labels explicitly split some grainsbecause of some dendritic formation of the grains edge similar tothe one presented inFig. 3.Generally,Mwas bigger than the real number of ceramic grains.In other to reduceMfor the real number of grainsM
r/C01, ﬁrstly the number of elements ofAwith each label was determined, thenanother line search throughAwas performed and every time thatthe ﬁrst neighbours ofA
i;jhad more than two distinct labels (notconsidering 1 or 0) the label of the smaller group was changedby the label of the biggest group. The result obtained after this pro-cedure, for the picture ofFig. 2is shown inFig. 4.

rÞfor the elements belonging to the grains. The area of a grainlwas determined as the total numberof elementsA
i;j¼l. In order to determine the edge length betweentwo grains another line search through Awas performed, going from linei¼1t onand columnj¼1u pt om. During this line search an auxiliary arrayLwas used and the elementL
p;kstored the number of elementsA
i;jat the edge between grainspandk (2<p;k<M
rand initiallyL¼0). Along the line search the valuesofA
i;jwere stored in variables v1;2;3, representing the actual ele- ment read
v1, and the two predecessors read elements v2;3. Every time that
v1¼0, a grain edge is reached, so the value v2is the label of the grain original analyzing, so it was saved in variable p. After thisedge-event, the line search continous, but the values of thelabels ofA
i;jwere stored at variable v3, and when v3–0;k¼ v3
was set, determining the other grain participating in the edge.Hence, elementL
p;kwas up dated with a unit. At the end of the linesearch only the elementsL
pk–0 indicates the conectivity (ﬁrstneighbors) for all grains and consequently the size of the edgebetween grainsfp;kg.Knowing the label of each pixel, is possible to determine thecentroid of each ceramic grain, by calculating the media indexesð/C22i

In order to determine the morphology of a Voronoi diagram[28]built using the same rectangular regular lattice Vorwith n/C2melements and the centroids of the original ceramic theregion of inﬂuence of each centroid was determined calculatingthe euclidian distanced

1) and small sites (sites with less than 2 % of the total image area) are not matching each other.
In order to reproduce the same behavior of the original ceramicwas proposed to build a new diagram based on the Voronoi algo-rithm, but instead of calculating the euclidean distance betweentwo elements ofVora weight factorw

withw lbeen the number of pixels associated with site l. On other words, it was related to the original area of the ceramic grain. Thisweigth factor can be interpreted as a form to compute the non-linear inﬂuence of each grain at the ceramic processingmanufacturing.
The result obtained by this algorithm can be observed on Fig. 7. Coupling the diagram ofFig. 7and the original contours associatedwith each site as depicted inFig. 8, is possible to observe that theproposed weigth factor imposes an agreement between the origi-nal ceramic geometrical features and the built one.In order to quantitatively compare the results obtained for theoriginal ceramic and the typical Voronoi Diagram using the cen-troids of each grain previously determined the normalized his-tograms for the number of sites as a function of the site’s areawas calculated, as shown inFig. 9(a) and (b), where a distributionfunction can be casted in format of a gamma functions as proposed.At the same way the normalized histograms for the number ofsites per edge length, presented a continuous behaviour of gaus-sian functions, as observed onFigs. 10(a) and (b).These calculations related to the distribution of areas andlengths of edges for the grains, can be used as a source probabilitydistribution function (p.d.f.) to build a large diagram that recoverthe same statistical behaviour of the original ceramic. To evaluatethis one may use some Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm asMetropolis-Hastings[29], in order to determine the weight factor(area related) for each Voronoi like diagram cell, and at indirectlydetermine the position center of each grain cell.A procedure that evaluate the proposed mechanism to deter-mine large diagramns, can be depicted as the following ﬁve stepalgorithm:

Determine the area of inﬂuence of each Voronoi Cell.The third step can be held on the same one way as depictedbefore. The second step can be determined by using an auxiliarsquare lattice of speciﬁc lengthL, where theN
ssites, topologically considered as spheres of radius r
s,2associated with the areaA s
must be set up covering the square lattice on a way to minimizethe vacancies between each one of the N
ssites, on a similar proce- dure as proposed in the rearragment of containers as proposed inRef.[30].
In order to validade the previous algorithm for the caracteriza-tion of ceramic samples, we analyze the main features of the urandioxide (UO
2) polycristalline pellet image collected on Fig. 1 ofRef.[31]. The reconstructed image, the correspondent Voronoi Dia-gram and the centers of each grain can be observed can be observedatFig. 11.The distribution functions associated with experimentalmicrostructure and the corresponding Voronoi diagram are showninFig. 12.Using the proposed curveNðxÞ=N
maxfor the areas, we determine the radius ofN
s¼104sites, and determine, and using the threestep procedure described we determine a huge lattice comparedto the original lattice, produced with the experimental image, witha very similar statistical feature for the area and the cells boundarylength as observed inFig. 13.Probably, due to the stochastic behaviour of Metropolis-Hastingalgorithm, the approximation of the centers of the grains/Voronoicelss, addicted to the small number of grains/sites of the originalssamples, the p.d.f.’s associated with the area and the boundarylength of each grain for the bigger lattice, do not exactly matchthe original functions. But the main goal of the proposed algorithmis achieve, with the procedure proposed we are now able to createmore realistic approximated lattices, that are intrinsecly correlatedto experimental data.In other words, a better computational/mathematical back-ground to create useful random lattices that are the aim ofinterest to develop studies related to percolation, partial differ-ential equations, and other sets of computational areas of inter-est to material science, can be performed using the proposedalgorithm.3. ConclusionsThe proposed scanning algorithm is a very useful technique tomanipulate 2D ceramic images containing the grains edges. Aquantitative characterization of the grains edge length and areacan be casted in the format of normalized histograms and the con-nectivity of the grains (ﬁrst neighbours) can be explicitly deter-mined. The previous features described allows the constructionof huge inhomogeneous lattices statistically correlated to realceramics, creating a useful framework for many material scienceresearch areas using a Voronoi like diagram algorithm where theinﬂuence of each grain is modulated as a weigth factor related tothe grain area.
