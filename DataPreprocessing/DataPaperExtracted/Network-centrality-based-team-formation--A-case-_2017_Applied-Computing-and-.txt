KEYWORDSSocial Network Analysis(SNA);Centrality measures;T-20 cricket;Small world network;Clustering coefﬁcientAbstractThis paper proposes and evaluates the novel utilization of small world network proper-ties for the formation of team of players with both best performances and best belongingness withinthe team network. To verify this concept, this methodology is applied to T-20 cricket teams. Theplayers are treated as nodes of the network, whereas the number of interactions between team mem-bers is denoted as the edges between those nodes. All intra country networks form the cricket net-work for this case study. Analysis of the networks depicts that T-20 cricket network inherits allcharacteristics of small world network. Making a quantitative measure for an individual perfor-mance in the team sports is important with respect to the fact that for team selection of an Inter-national match, from pool of best players, only eleven players can be selected for the team. Thestatistical record of each player considered as a traditional way of quantifying the performanceof a player. But the other criteria such as performing against a strong opponent or performanceas an effective team member such as ﬁelding, running between the wickets, good partnershipdeserves more credential. In this paper a revised method based on social networking is presentedto quantify thequalityof team belongingness and efﬁciency of each player. The application ofSocial Network Analysis (SNA) is explored to measure performances and the rank of the players.A bidirectional weighted network of players is generated using the information collected from T-20cricket (2014–2016) and used for network analysis. Thus team was formed based on that rankingand compared with their IPL (Indian Premier League) performances of 2016.

The focus of this paper is to apply the social net-work analysis techniques such as clustering coefﬁcients andcentrality measurements to quantify the belongingness of anindividual player within the team along with their individualperformances. As a result, the quality of the players as a teammember reﬂected in team formation which is very importantfor team sports. Based on that characterization the key players(in a role based approach) can be selected for a teamformation.Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams,consisting eleven players in the both team, on a cricket ﬁeld.One team is the batting team, attempts to score as many runsas possible, while their opponents are the bowling team, whichgive ﬁelding and bowling and try to take as many as wicketsand restrict the runs of the batting team. In short term cricket,the length of each innings ranges from 20 overs of six bowlingdeliveries per side (T-20 cricket) to 50 over deliveries per side(one day cricket) and in case of Test cricket, there is a maxi-mum of four innings played over ﬁve days, and per day max-imum 90 overs can be played.In this paper, a ranking system based on both players’ per-formance statistics and belongingness is proposed. To capturethe belongingness of a player, centrality measures and cluster-ing coefﬁcient are considered. The data for network generationfor this research work are collected from international T-20cricket matches for the session 2014–2016. Statistical recordsof top ten countries Australia, England, South Africa, NewZealand, India, West Indies, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladeshand Zimbabwe are considered. From late 2000, ICC (Interna-tional Cricket Council, the highest parenting body of cricket)introduced the shortest format called T-20 cricket which areplayed for twenty-twenty overs and durations of the matchesare approximately three hours[3]. Players are selected basedon their centrality measures and clustering coefﬁcient andﬁnally a pool of players are formed from where a team of ele-ven players can be selected. Best team according to the pro-posed approach is also compared with IPL 2016 teams.We are comparing our results with IPL 2016 teams. Most ofthe countries that played Test Cricket have a domestic cupcompetition, and in case of India it is Indian Premium League,often abbreviated as IPL. The IPL is the most attracting formof cricket in the world and ranks sixth among all sports lea-gues, contested every year during April–March by franchiseteams representing Indian cities from different states. Thereare currently 8 teams playing in this tournament, and eachmember of the team is selected by auction of players doneby the franchisees. Each franchise can select a squad of 14players based on their different performance matrices, andfrom them 11 of the players are played in the day of match.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the related works are discussed. The proposed approach forteam formation is discussed in Section3. This section high-lights small world characteristics of T-20 cricket network. Dif-ferent centrality measures and clustering coefﬁcient techniquefrom the view point of cricket network are also discussed. InSection4, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is evalu-ated and compared with IPL T-20 session 2016. In Section 5a brief discussion is made comparing other best team formationapproaches with proposed approach. Finally, the paper con-cludes in Section6.2. Related workIn recent research trends, several works have been done forperformance measures of a team, where team belongingnessof individual performance along with their individual perfor-mances in team sports plays a signiﬁcant role. Different tech-niques used in analysing team sports like football can befound in[4–8].I n[9,10], interactions among players are anal-ysed in other ball sports such as baseball and basketballrespectively. Another network analysis approach has beendone on Spanish Teams performance during FIFA WorldCup 2010[11]. They have done a temporal analysis of theresulting passes network, taken into account the number ofpasses, length of the chain of passes, and centrality, clusteringcoefﬁcient measure of the players. Some researchers also con-sider the basic fact of a team sports and instead of measuringsimple statistics as number goals or number assists, they putemphasis on the players ability a team member by generationa ﬂow network[12].I n[13,14]network based approaches areused for performance analysis of players in tennis. In [15,16] a network was generated using the interaction of players forcricket. Performances of water polo also quantiﬁed throughnetwork-based approach.Not only in sports, network based approach in team build-ing is more recent trend of analysis along with data mining andweb mining tools[17,18]. Though these papers focussed on for-mation of network, social network characteristics are not usedfor ranking systems or team formation.3. Proposed approach for team formationThis work presents a social network analysis based approachto form a team. Both the performances and belongingness ofplayers are considered here. Initially, from the data of T-20cricket session 2014–2016 a pool of players is created o thebasis of their performance. A player is included in the poolas a batsman if he has scored more than 900 runs in T-20 inter-national matches during 2014–2016. Similarly, a player isselected as a bowler if he has taken more than 35 wicketsduring that period in T-20 international matches. The majorsteps of the proposed approach are (1) network formation ofthe T-20 cricket, (2) identiﬁcation of small world propertiesin the network, and (3) formation of a pool of players withrespect to high centrality and clustering coefﬁcient measures.From this pool, four teams are selected on the basis of players’betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, node degree distri-
bution and clustering coefﬁcient. Players are also assignedranks according to these measures in the corresponding team.These four teams are compared with present IPL teams, 2016.Fig. 1shows a ﬂow diagram of the proposed approach.
Figure 1Flow diagram of the proposed approach.162 P. Dey et al.3.1. Network formationCricket database is created from match by match statistics col-lected fromwww.espncricinfo.comWeb site, and imported onexcel sheet as an adjacency matrix as shown in Table 1. This adjacency matrix deﬁnes the number of matches playedbetween players. We have formed a player vs. player matrix,where we deﬁne the number of matches common betweentwo players. Firstly this was done by individual team basisand the intra network is formed. A small sample network isshown inFig. 2Each team member is deﬁned as a node inthe graph, and connection between them represents the edgesof the graph. The weighted directed edges are created fromthe ratio of common matches and total number of matchesplayed by that player. From the reference ﬁgure it is clear thatthe thick edges represent profound relationship between twoplayers whereas thin edges represent less interaction. Then ateam vs. team matrix was formed for all the countries underconsideration and thus network of networks of all countriesis formed as shown inFig. 3. This network is executed inGephi (https://gephi.org/), which is a free and open sourcesoftware. Finally, the network parameters are calculated. Apartial data table showing the derived parameters is shownin appendix asTable 4.3.2. Small world characteristics of T-20 cricket networkIt is important for the cricket network to be a small world net-work[1], as our idea is to use the centrality measures and clus-tering coefﬁcient to detect the key players in the network.However, most of the nodes are not directly connected in asmall world, but the distance (i.e., number of hops) betweentwo nodes is signiﬁcantly less and the nodes connecting othernodes play signiﬁcant role in the network.In a network, small world coefﬁcientrcan be deﬁned as. r¼ðC
Actual =CRandom Þ=ðL Actual =LRandom Þ:This value should be greater than 1 for being a small worldnetwork[1].HereC
ActualandC Random signify the clustering coefﬁcients ofplayers’ network and random network respectively. Similarly,L
Actual andL Random respectively signify the average path lengthsof players network and random network.At ﬁrst, we have generated network for T-20 cricket net-work.Fig. 4shows the random graph and T-20 cricket net-work graph with same number of nodes. Clusteringcoefﬁcient and average path length for the network are calcu-lated. Clustering coefﬁcient for T-20 is derived as 0.702 andaverage path length is calculated as 2.147. Now to calculater, a random network[19]is generated using random rewiringprobability. Clustering coefﬁcients of random network withsame number of nodes (as the actual T-20 cricket network)are 0.14 and average Path Length is 2.081. Thus, the smallworld coefﬁcient, i.e.,rof T-20 cricket network is calculatedas 4.86 which is not only greater than 1, but shows higher valuethan small world coefﬁcients of karate (1.65) and the Internetnetworks (2.38)[20]. This result clearly depicts that the T-20cricket network inherits small world phenomenon.3.3. Clustering coefﬁcientClustering coefﬁcient of a node (player) in the network signi-ﬁes characteristics of that node (player) forming local clusterthat is numbers of nodes (players) those are inﬂuenced by thatparticular node (player). In this context, the dense local clustersigniﬁes that node (player) has great inﬂuence to other nodes(players). In social networks, especially in small world net-works, generally all nodes are highly connected and the cluster-ing coefﬁcient is also quite high valued than the averageclustering coefﬁcient of random network. The local clusteringcoefﬁcient of a node is also deﬁned as the number of completegraph (clique) that can be formed using the neighbor of thatnode. This property was ﬁrst introduced by Watts and Stro-gatz[1]for deﬁning small world coefﬁcient. The clusteringcoefﬁcient varies between 0 (no clustering) and 1 (maximumclustering)[20].Let graphG¼ðn;lÞdenotes set of nodesnand a set of links lconnecting the nodes.

GðnÞClustering can be measured in different ways also. Onecommon procedure for measuring is to ﬁnd existing triangles,i.e., to check that when two edges share a node, and then in anetwork with high clustering, it is highly probable that a thirdedge exists to form a triangles[22]. Small world networks havethe characteristics of highly clustered nodes. From the analysisit can be stated that the cricket network is highly clustered asmaximum players have high clustering coefﬁcient value. Aver-age clustering coefﬁcient is the mean value of individual clus-tering coefﬁcients. In this work, a total number of 39,784triangles are formed in the T-20 network and average cluster-ing coefﬁcient is calculated as 0.702. The maximum clusteringcoefﬁcient is derived as 1 and distribution graphs of players inthe role of batsman and bowler (only for the players who qual-iﬁed for the performance pool) respectively are shown in Figs. 5 and 6.3.4. Average path lengthIn a graphG¼ðV;EÞof ordernthe average path length isdeﬁned as the average distance between any two pair ofvertices[21]. It is denoted by the arithmetic mean of distancebetween any two randomly chosen nodes or players. Thus,average path length can be deﬁned as[21]: lðGÞ¼1n2/C18/C19X
u;v/C26Vdðu;vÞAverage path length signiﬁes how well the players in thenetwork are connected to the other players in the player net-work. The characteristics of small world network are that aver-age path length is comparatively smaller compared to randomor scale free network.3.5. Betweenness centralityBetweenness centrality is a widely used centrality measure. Foreach single node present in the network, betweenness centralityof that node can be deﬁned as proportionality of total shortestpaths passing through that nodes to all possible shortest pathspresent in network[23]. A player with high value of between-ness centrality measure has large inﬂuence on the other play-ers. Betweenness centrality of nodencan be expressed as[23] C

Figure 5Distribution of different measures of players in the roleof batsman.164 P. Dey et al.betweenness centrality play important roles within the net-work. In the computation, total number of shortest paths isderived as 51,302, for 227 numbers of players. Normalizedbetweenness centrality distribution graphs for players in therole of batsman and bowler respectively are shown in Figs. 5 and 6.3.6. Closeness centralityIn a graph representing a small world network, closeness cen-trality measures how close a node is to others in the network.In other words, the closeness centrality of a node in a networkis the inverse of distance between two nodes in that network.By the use of closeness centrality one can determine the efﬁ-ciency of each node with respect to others for spreading infor-mation in the network. The shorter the distance between twonodes, the larger the closeness centrality and thus ensures themore efﬁcient spreading in the network. There are variousalgorithms for deﬁning closeness centrality measurements bycalculating all pair shortest paths. A node is considered asan important node if that node is relatively close to othernodes. Closeness is reciprocal of farness. To calculate closenesscentrality of a node the equation can be deﬁned as [21] closenessðuÞ¼X

vuis the shortest distance between these two nodes. In T-20cricket network, closeness centrality value ranges between 1and 52.3.Figs. 5 and 6shows the normalized closeness central-ity distribution of players in the role of batsman and bowler.3.7. Node degree distributionAmong all centrality measures degree distribution is the sim-plest one. Degree of a node in a network is determined bythe total number of outgoing and ingoing edges from thatnode. In case of directed graph we have two types of degreedistribution namely out-degree and in-degree distribution foreach node. Although in case of undirected graph there is nosuch classiﬁcation. When analysing the weighted networks,degree has generally expressed as sum of nodes. For calculat-ing the total degree distribution of a node in a directed graph,all the incoming and outgoing edges should be added. The in-degree and out-degree of nodeuis the total number of connec-tions onto and from nodeurespectively. Basically degree dis-tribution captures only a small amount of data of a smallworld network, but that information gives us the importantclues about the network. Nodes with highest number of degreehave greatest inﬂuence on connection the other nodes andworking as the hub of the network. In T-20 cricket, the valueof node degree centrality ranges from 22 to 68 for the playersselected in the performance pool and the distribution (normal-ized) of players in the role of batsman and bowler is shown inFigs. 5 and 6.4. Selection of playerFrom the pool of players who meet the criterion of perfor-mance, based on the clustering coefﬁcient, betweenness cen-trality, closeness centrality and node degree distribution, thekey players are selected in a ranked manner. Each cricket teamhas batsman, bowler, all-rounder and wicketkeeper which canbe designated as the role of the players in the team. Based onthe role required for a cricket, a team is selected from the poolof players formed using the proposed approach.In this work, T-20 cricket network is formed for a total of227 players (session 2014–2016) and total number of shortestpaths is derived as 51302. As discussed earlier, performancedata (runs, wickets, ﬁelding) are collected for each player.Then those designated players are sorted according to theirbetweenness centrality, closeness centrality, clustering coefﬁ-cient and degree in descending order and normalized those val-ues. Now from the pool of players with high performances,players in different roles are selected based on their centralitymeasures and clustering coefﬁcients. From the analysis, thebest teams are shown inTable 2.For the comparison, we show the ﬁrst eleven (based on themaximum appearance) from the squad of 25 players of IPL2016 teams inTable 3. It depicts that almost all players ofthe best teams are included in the ﬁrst eleven. Statistics alsoreﬂect that performance of these players has a great contribu-tion for their teams. 19 players are appeared in ﬁrst eleven ofeight IPL teams out of 22 players that belong to our best fourteams (refer toTables 3 and 2) Proposed team matching indexwith IPL is 86.36%, whereas for ICC best rank players (22numbers) matching index is 14 out of 22, i.e., 63.63% (exclud-ing players from Pakistan). In other words, more than 86%players in the team formed using our proposed approach areincluded in the ﬁrst eleven team (excluded the players fromPakistan as they didn’t participate in this season of IPL) ascompared to 63% of the best ranked players of ICC T-20ranking.It is interesting that team Royal challenger Bengaluru havemost players in the role of batsman from our proposed pool ofplayers. However, none of their bowlers are from this pool. Inthe real scenario, the team Royal challenger Bengaluru per-formed very well and they were the ﬁrst qualiﬁer for the ﬁnalof IPL season 2016, however their comparatively poor bowlingsection was a drawback of their performance. Now the otherthree teams that include maximum number of players fromour proposed best teams are Rising Pune Supergiant, SunrisersHyderabad and Gujarat Lions. From these four teams exceptRising Pune Supergiant, other teams are top three teams ofIPL 2016.
Figure 6Distribution of different measures of players in the roleof bowler.Network centrality based team formation 1655. DiscussionIn this paper, we have presented an approach which includesboth performance and bonding with the teammates. It isbecome important to select the players who have maximumpotential and have the capability of playing team game, whichbuilds the success of the team. Moreover for each role/positionit requires a proper balance so that the team can play withmaximum coordination.For the ranking of the players, other approaches such asneural network is applied to the selection of players. For exam-ple, in the case of annual Australian Football League (AFL)national draft, team formation involves mathematical and sta-tistical approach for extracting knowledge from the neural net-work[24]. A recent study have been made, where theresearchers model a decision-making process of a single sportsfranchise, which takes a combination of the players estimatedvalue along with the value of the other players currently avail-able, and the position wise analysis required for that particularteam[25]. But all these techniques ignore the fact that interac-tion of the players can play an important role for team perfor-mance. We are trying to incorporate this property and ﬁndthat it is more closure to the real team selection.Table 2Best team with respect to betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, node degree distribution, clustering coefﬁcient.

This paper usesthree centrality measures betweenness centrality, closeness cen-trality, node degree distribution and clustering coefﬁcient forevaluation of players. Few key players, that exhibit higher cen-trality values or clustering coefﬁcient may inﬂuence manyother players and take a signiﬁcant role in team formation.In this work, we put an emphasis on quantifying the perfor-mance of players from the history of previous years’ dataabout their batting, bowling performances, as well as takinga qualitative measure based on clustering coefﬁcient and cen-trality measures derived from the network of players. Boththe characteristics are used as team formation strategy and arole based team was formed.AcknowledgementThere is no grant for this research work.Appendix A.SeeTable 4.References
