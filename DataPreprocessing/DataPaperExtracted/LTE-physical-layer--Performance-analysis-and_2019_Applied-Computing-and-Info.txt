1. IntroductionProviding higher-speed data transmission has always been themost concerned objective of the 4th generation of mobile commu-nication standards. That is why these standards have constantlybeen suffering from prohibitive cost, splintering of technologystandards and lack of user interest. Evolved UMTS Terrestrial RadioAccess Network (E-UTRAN) is one of the 4th generation mobilecommunication standards for mobile communications introducedby 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) [1]. Unlike 3rd gen- eration standards which use CDMA technique, LTE makes use ofOrthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) for downlinkand Single Carrier-Frequency Division Multiple Access (SC-FDMA)for uplink transmission. It has a very ﬂexible radio interface, andits core network is called System Architecture Evolution (SAE) orEvolved Packed Core (EPC). The most serious rival for LTE standardis the IEEE 802.16e standard, which is well-known as WiMAX andwas developed by IEEE[2,3].2. Overview of 3GPP LTE2.1. System architectureLTE came up with a new network architecture called SAE. SAEarchitecture consists of two main parts: EPC and E-UTRAN(Fig. 1). These two parts together form a system called EvolvedPacket System (EPS). EPS routes the IP packets with a given QoS,from Packet Data Network Gateway (P-GW) to User Equipment(UE). E-UTRAN manages the radio resources and makes sure ofthe security of transmitted data[4]. E-UTRAN entirely consists of base stations only, which are connected to the UEs providing net-work air interface roles. E-UTRAN architecture is ﬂat, thus there isno centralized controlling in E-UTRAN [5]. E-UTRAN and EPC net- work components are connected together via standard interfaces[6].The EPC enables commuting data packets with the internet aswell as UE while a given QoS is maintained. EPC includes HomeSubscriber Service (HSS), Policy Control and Charging Rules Func-tion (PCRF), Mobility Management Entity (MME), P-GW and Serv-ing Gateway (S-GW).2.2. Protocol architecture of LTE physical layerFig. 2illustrates the physical layer protocol architecturebetween LTE network and UE. This air interface is composed ofthree layers commonly called layers 1, 2 and 3. The medium accesscontrol (MAC) layer transport channels, in the upper levels, are

connected to logical channels which link the MAC layer to the RLClayer.The logical channels in the MAC layer are characterized by thetype of data transferred through them.2.3. Multiple access techniquesThe downlink transmission utilizes a multiple access schemebased on OFDM with a Cyclic Preﬁx (CP) while the uplink transmis-sion uses a scheme based on SC-FDMA with a CP [9]. Since OFDM allows us to avoid Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI), transmission ofhigh-speed serial streams is highly possible. The LTE supportstransmission on a dedicated carrier for Multicast/Broadcast overa Single Frequency Network (MBSFN) [10,11]by utilizing a longer CP with a subcarrier spacing of 7.5 kHz. MIMO techniques areemployed in LTE[12]. LTE also maintains aggregation of multiplecells in both uplink and downlink directions with up to ﬁve servingcells, where each serving cell can have a transmission bandwidthof up to 20 MHz.2.4. Physical resource allocationsThe LTE physical layer supports two types of frame structures astypes 1 and 2. The type 1 structure ( Fig. 3) is used for Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) mode; however, the type 2 structure(Fig. 4) is applied to Time Division Duplex (TDD) mode maintainingonly full duplex operation. Type 1 lasts 10 ms equivalent to 10 sub-frames (each 1 ms long) or 20 slots (each 0.5 ms long). As in FDD,each frame consists of 10 subframes of 1 ms long and each sub-frame consists of two concatenated slots of 0.5 ms long. The radioframe used in TDD mode (type 2) also has a length of 10 ms, but itis divided to two half-frames of length 5 ms. Just like the FDD, eachsubframe of type 2 frame structure also consists of two slots oflength 0.5 ms. The special subframe in each half-frame includesthree ﬁelds; DwPTS (Downlink Pilot Time Slot), GP (Guard Period)and UpPTS (Uplink Pilot Time Slot).The transmitted signal within each slot is deﬁned by a resourcegrid ofNULRBNRBscsubcarriers andNULSymbSC-FDMA symbols for uplink, and a resource grid ofN

The minimum and a maximum number of resource blocks forboth uplink and downlink are 6 and 100 respectively. Table 1 shows the resource block (RB) conﬁguration for different channelbandwidths.The number of symbols (SC-FDMA symbol in uplink andOFDMA symbols in downlink direction) per slot is conﬁguredbased on the CP length and the subcarrier spacing selected bythe higher layers. The small blocks in the resource grids areResource Elements (RE), and a set of REs forms an RB. Hence, thenumber of REs existed in each RB is N

Performance evaluation Of LTE physical layer3.1. Link level simulatorWe have utilized only the Link Level simulation ( Fig. 7) for downlink transmissions[13–15]. In LTE, the transmission processstarts when user data is generated and tailed with Cyclic Redun-dancy Check (CRC)[16]. In next step, each user’s data is encodedindependently using a turbo encoder. Then each coded block isinterleaved and rate-matched to achieve the target rate, and thenmodulated based on the received Channel Quality Indicator (CQI)feedback value[17]. The possible modulation schemes are 4-QAM, 16-QAM, and 64QAM.The User Equipment absorbs the signal transmitted by theevolved Node Base (eNodeB) and performs the reverse processingmade by the transmitter. The receiver in UE then provides the nec-essary information (Fig. 7).3.2. LTE physical layer modulationAdaptive modulation and coding, support of MIMO systems andHARQ are the key features of the LTE downlink. The modulationschemes speciﬁed in[13]for downlink transmission are 16-QAM,64-QAM, BPSK, and QPSK.3.3. LTE downlink physical channel processingIn LTE, data and control information are encoded down from theMAC to the physical layer and decoded back from physical to MAClayer to serve transport and control Channels. Once the channelcoding is performed, its output will be kept in a circular bufferwhere Redundancy Versions (RVs) are constituted. An RV is consid-ered as the retransmission unit in the Hybrid Automatic Repeatrequest (HARQ) technique, and maximum 4 of them are permittedto be used in LTE.The signal processing is shown inFig. 8. First, the coded bits in every codeword are scrambled and conveyed to physical channels.The next step is to map these complex-valued modulated symbolsinto one or few transferring layers. Once the layer mapping is done,the process of precoding of modulated symbols on each layer willbe started and the output will be conveyed to the antenna ports.The precoded symbols for each antenna port are then mapped intoresource elements, and eventually, generation of time-domainOFDM signal for every single antenna port takes place. At the UE,to detect the transmitted signal and discover the original data, aTable 2Resource Block Parameters.

The receiver mustsend requests for up to 3 retransmissions of redundancy versionto the transmitter.3.4. Channel Coding, Interleaving and rate matchingThe turbo encoder used in LTE consists of two convolutionalconcatenated encoders that are connected by an interleaver. Thecode rate of turbo coder used in the LTE is 1/3 and its two gener-ated polynomials are G0 = [1011] and G1 = [1101]. From two can-didates as Quadratic Permutation Polynomial (QPP) and AlmostRegular Permutation (ARP), QPP was selected to improve the max-imum throughput of the system. This interleaver is a conﬂict-freeparallel turbo coder and provides maximum ﬂexibility in support-ing the parallelism. In LTE, the value for QPP inverse polynomialinterleaver is 4. From the 1/3 rate output of the turbo coder, RateMatching (RM) algorithm selects bits for transmission via punctur-ing or repeating. In rate matching, the bits in the code block arepunctured and repeated to achieve a desired Effective Code Rate(ECR).4. Performance evaluation metricsThe LTE Link Level Simulator has key features such as the Adap-tive Modulation and Coding (AMC). It consists of few functionalsections, which are one eNodeB (transmitter), N number of UEs(receivers), a downlink channel model, signaling information, andan error-free uplink feedback channel with adjustable delay. Acomplete set of physical layer variables can be modiﬁed in the sim-ulator. The eNodeB can estimate the code rate and modulationscheme by using the Sounding Reference Signal (SRS). Refs. [18– 22]have presented the physical layer throughput as 100 Mbps,150 Mbps and 300 Mbps for 1, 2 and 4 antenna ports respectively.Based on bandwidth of 1.4–20 MHz, the number of antenna ports(1, 2, or 4), the number of OFDM symbols assigned for PDCCH (1,2, or 3 symbols per subframe), different channel code rates(0.0762–0.9258) and modulation schemes (4-QAM, 16-QAM, or64-QAM), different system throughput performance as well asBER and BLER performances were obtained. The MIMO systemmodels are described in detail in[23–26]. The input of this simula- tor is 500 subframes with random transmitting data selected bythe simulator itself. For the results of this downlink simulation,average values of throughput, BER, and BLER vs. average valuesof SNR are calculated and plotted in form of MATLAB ﬁgures.5. Results and discussion5.1. Simulation parametersBesides PDSCH, there are other physical channels (e.g. PBCH,PDCCH, and PMCH); however, this information is mainly controland broadcast information.Table 4summarizes the simulation parameters and depicts those conﬁgured for the simulation work.We have considered stable user equipment’s, channel band-width of 1.4 MHz, channel type of AWGN with the ideal channelestimator (Perfect), CQI = 9, 8 turbo code iterations, and 3 HARQretransmissions for simulation.5.2. SISO techniquesSISO or Single-Input and Single-Output technique is a wirelesscommunications system in which the only one transmit antennais used at the transmitter and only one receive antenna is usedat the receiver to carry out the transmission.5.2.1. Performance analysis of different CQI numbersInFig. 9the BER curves for different CQI feedback values andmodulation schemes are presented under different channel condi-tions (Channel SNR). It can be seen from the ﬁgure that for channelSNR values lower than/C05 dB, the CQI = 1, which used 4-QAM mod-ulation scheme and ECR of 0.0762, has the lowest error rate, thusthe best transmission quality. Lower order modulation schemeshave lower data rates as the number of bits per symbol is less. Itresults in increasing the symbol pulse-width thus decreasing signalbandwidth and a better BER performance.However, in the case of increasing channel SNR, CQI = 9, whichutilizes 16-QAM modulation scheme and ECR = 0.6016 appears toTable 4Simulation parameters.

/C06at a desirable channel SNR of 8 dB. This is because of using very effective errorprotection level (ECR = 0.6016) associated with the modulationscheme for this CQI feedback. Decreasing of the error rate is per-formed by applying a better ECR and a better Cyclic RedundancyCheck (CRC) scheme.Table 5shows the CQI user feedback conﬁg-uration of the LTE downlink simulator.5.2.2. Performance analysis of different channel typesInFig. 11, the BER performance of AWGN, Pedestrian B (PedB)and Flat Rayleigh, is investigated. In terms of error rate, the AWGNchannel provides the lowest error at low channel SNR values, as theBER¼10
/C06is achieved at the channel SNR = 8 dB. However, PedBand Flat Rayleigh channel models result in poorer BER perfor-mances in comparison with AWGN. The PedB channel results in abetter BER performance than the Flat Rayleigh channel. But, inthe Flat Rayleigh channel, the signal is corrupted more severe thanin the PedB channel.FromFig. 12, the throughput performance of AWGN channel isbetter than the performance of both PedB and Flat Rayleigh chan-nels. This channel results in throughput improvement to higherthan 2 Mbit/s at the channel SNR = 8 dB; however, the throughputof the system experiencing PedB or Flat Rayleigh channels can beimproved to higher than 2 Mbit/s at the SNR = 20 dB, which is12 dB higher than that of AWGN channel.5.2.3. Performance analysis for different turbo code iterationsThe BER and BLER performances are shown in Figs. 13 and 14 respectively. At turbo decoder, data decoding function is iterateduntil the decoder maximum iteration number is reached. Aftereach iteration, the output of turbo decoder is stored and later usedas an input parameter for the next decoding iteration helping thedecoder to make a better decision. Thus, by increasing the numberof turbo decoder iterations the BER performance of the system canbe improved, as inFig. 13at the 8th iteration, a BER of 10
/C06can be achieved at the channel SNR = 8 dB.Fig. 14illustrates that the SNR improvement gap between 1stand 3rd iterations is much larger than the SNR improvementbetween 3rd and 5th iterations.

Table 5At low channel SNRs, higher CQI feedback values will have poor BER performancethan the lower CQI feedback values. However, by increasing the signal power, lowererror ratio for higher CQI feedback values can be achieved. In Fig. 10, the throughput performance for different CQI conﬁgurations and different modulation schemesassociated with different ECRs can be obtained. The higher CQI values result in betteroverall throughput performance but at the price of higher channel SNR.

Mousavi et al. / Applied Computing and Informatics 15 (2019) 34–44InFig. 15the throughput performance improvement betweenlow iteration numbers is much larger than the throughput perfor-mance improvement between high iteration numbers.5.2.4. Performance analysis of different HARQ retransmissionsFrom theFigs. 16 and 17, by increasing the number of HARQretransmissions the system BER and BLER are decreased. This isbecause when a packet is found to be in error for the ﬁrst time,up to 3 retransmission requests are sent toward the transmitterwhile the corrupted packet at the receiver is ignored. For SNR val-ues 0–8 dB the 3 HARQ retransmissions technique improves thesystem BER performance moderately better than no HARQ retrans-missions technique. But, at the expenses of increasing SNR to 9 dB,both methods perform alike. Therefore, there is no point of usingHARQ retransmissions technique for high channel SNR values.InFig. 18, at low channel SNR values, a signiﬁcant differencebetween no HARQ and 3 HARQ retransmission schemes can beseen. This is since the 3 HARQ retransmissions technique canrequest data retransmissions for up to 3 times.5.2.5. Performance analysis of different channel estimationsInFig. 19the system’s BER improvement uses the Perfect orMinimum Mean Square Error (MMSE), with a comparison to theLeast Squares (LS). However, in the MMSE channel estimator, itrequires the second-order statistics of the channel and the noise,and it makes the MMSE channel estimator much more accuratethan the LS. As at the channel SNR of 8 dB, by utilizing the MMSEchannel estimator or the Perfect channel estimator a BER close to10
/C06can be achieved. However, choosing the LS algorithm as thechannel estimator can only give a BER close to 10
/C06at the expense of a higher channel SNR value which is 10 dB.Fig. 20shows the throughput performance of Perfect, MMSEand LS channel estimators, where the SNR improvement of theMMSE channel estimator in comparison to the LS channel estima-tor is approximately 2 dB. While a system using the MMSE channelestimator performs only about 0.5 dB worse than a system withperfect channel knowledge.5.2.6. Performance analysis of different user speedsFigs. 21 and 22present the BER and throughput performancesof the LTE physical layer respectively, while AWGN channel wassimulated to associate a ﬁxed user, and PedB and Flat Rayleighchannels associate users with 10 km/h and 100 km/h of velocity

 Fig. 16.BER vs. SNR for different number of HARQ retransmissions, SISO.H. Mousavi et al. / Applied Computing and Informatics 15 (2019) 34–44 39respectively. If the SNR is low, the AWGN channel results in thebest BER performance. As the UE experiencing this channel condi-tion, we can achieve data with the BER ¼10
/C06at the SNR = 8 dB. While, in case of PedB channel associating a user with 10 km/hvelocity, as well as the Flat Rayleigh channel associating a userwith 100 km/h velocity, since the UEs experience the small-scalefading channel type (PedB and Flat Rayleigh). Comparing theFigs. 21 and 22withFigs. 11 and 12, the LTE standard is not sensi- tive to user mobility and user velocity, as the performances of thechannels tested in both with user mobility and without user mobil-ity scenarios are very similar.5.3. MIMO techniquesIn LTE, the MIMO technique with the possibility of up to eighttransmit antennas and eight receive antennas in downlink, andup to four transmit antennas and four receive antennas in uplinkdirection are supported. This feature allows transmitting up toeight streams of multi-layer in downlink and up to four multi-layer streams in uplink.

Performance analysis of different CQI numbersWe analyze the impact of a different number of CQI feedbackson a MIMO TxD 4/C22 system in the LTE standard. InFig. 23, the CQI number results in an increase of required SNR value to helpkeep the BER value at a desired value. Thus, to achieve a low BERvalue while increasing the quantity of CQI feedbacks, a penalty ofenhancing SNR must be paid. Since higher CQI values indicatehigher modulation orders and higher ECRs, thus higher bit rate istransferred, which causes increasing the signal bandwidth andoverlapping. So, we see that at low channel SNRs, higher CQI feed-back values will have worse BER performances than the lower CQIfeedback values.InFig. 24, the increasing CQI numbers result in better through-put performance. Since higher CQI feedback numbers indicatehigher modulation orders and higher ECRs; hence, higher data rateand thus higher throughput can be achieved, but it requires anincrease of signal power. Therefore, a trade-off between higherCQI numbers and lower SNR values should be made to design adesirable system.5.3.2. Performance analysis of different channel typesInFigs. 25 and 26, BER and BLER performances of four channeltypes, namely; AWGN, PedB, VehicularB (VehB) and Flat Rayleighare shown using a MIMO TxD 4x2 technique. If low SNR value isdesired, the AWGN channel performs the best among all four chan-nels in terms of error performance. As the system using AWGNchannel can approach the BER¼10
/C02at SNR lower than 6 dB. However, PedB, VehB, and Flat Rayleigh channel models whichare small-scale fading channel types, perform much worse thanthe AWGN in terms of the error performance. In Flat Rayleighchannel, the signal is corrupted more severe than in the PedBand VehB channels.InFig. 27, AWGN channel type results in better performance incomparison with VehB and Flat Rayleigh channels. The PedB chan-nel has better throughput performance than both the VehB channeland the Flat Rayleigh channel. In the Flat Rayleigh channel, the sig-nal is corrupted more severe than in the PedB and VehB channels,since the Rayleigh fades is added to the Flat fades, and the signalalso suffers from Non-Line-of-Sight propagation in multipathfading.

Performance analysis of different antenna diversitiesIn this scenario, BER, BLER and throughput performances of var-ious antenna diversities, namely; SU-SISO, SU-MIMO TxD 2 /C21, SU-MIMO TxD 2/C22, SU-MIMO TxD 4/C22 and Open Loop Spatial Multiplexing (OLSM) TxD 4/C22, used in LTE standard are analyzed.InFigs. 28and29, the impact of different antenna diversities onBER and BLER performances of LTE systems are presented, andthe BER and BLER improvements in SU-MIMO TxD 2 /C22 and SU- MIMO TxD 4/C22 techniques in comparison to other SISO andMIMO techniques is signiﬁcant. As, in the case of the BER ¼10
/C02
desired, utilizing SU-MIMO TxD 4/C22 and SU-MIMO TxD 2/C22 techniques result in 3 dB SNR gain in comparison with other tech-niques. This improvement is due to the increase of the number ofthe receive antenna, as when using two receive antenna insteadof one the variance of the noise term is scaled by a factor of 2. Fig- ure 28.

The maximum throughput achieved by SU-MIMOTxD 4/C22 technique is lower than the maximum throughputachieved by two SU-MIMO TxD 2x1 and SU-MIMO TxD 2 /C22 techniques.5.3.4. Performance analysis of different channel bandwidthsInFig. 31, BER performance of few channel bandwidths(1.4 MHz, 3 MHz, 5 MHz and 10 MHz) on an SU-MIMO TxD 2 /C21 LTE system is presented, where the BER difference between differ-ent channel bandwidths is insigniﬁcant. This is due to taking theadvantage of OFDM technique in downlink transmission, whichresults in decreasing ISI in high data rates. In addition to OFDMtechnique, using turbo coding, interleaver, and HARQ retransmis-sions help to keep the system BER at low levels.By analyzingFig. 32, increasing the transmission bandwidthresults in increasing the system throughput dramatically. Highersystem throughput can be obtained by utilizing larger channelbandwidths in the scenario.6. ConclusionThis study focused on the main parameters of LTE physical layeras well as the most frequent scenarios for mobile communications.Several techniques and technologies such as OFDM, OFDMA, SC-FDMA, and MIMO for the cellular systems were studied using aLink Level Simulator based on MATLAB program.A reduction of system BER and BLER can be achieved in LTEdownlink transmission. The effects of different numbers of HARQretransmissions and turbo code iterations were investigated forSISO mode. Different user speeds were simulated and analyzed interms of BER, BLER, and throughput in SISO systems, where MMSEchannel estimator has a much better consequence on transmissionthan the LS channel estimator. A system experiencing AWGN chan-nel condition results in a signiﬁcant BER and throughput improve-ment compared to systems involving with PedB, VehB or FlatRayleigh channel types. The system involving with PedB channelresults in a better performance. In MIMO systems, increasing thesystem bandwidth is a very effective way, but this solution obvi-ously is signiﬁcantly costly for service providers. Moreover, evalu-ation of physical layer throughput can be performed for nextRelease(s) of 3GPP, since some effective modern technologies suchas bandwidth extension up to 100 MHz and supporting moreantenna ports can highly impact the performance.References[1]X.
