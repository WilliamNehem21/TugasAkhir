Article history:Received 20 March 2021Received in revised form 10 October 2021Accepted 10 October 2021Available online 13 October 2021Automation and Artiﬁcial intelligence has been used to solve the world ’'s most complex problems. The goal of this study is to develop, evaluate and optimize cowpea seeds quality detection and separating device to meet inter-national export standards. The design of the device was divided into metering, automation, and conveyor beltoutlet unit. An evaluation was done using samples made up of good and bad (impurity) portions. Response sur-face methodology was used to evaluate, model and optimize the device performance. The optimized results werevalidated using regression and prediction interval (PI) analysis test. The separating ef ﬁciency, throughput, max- imum capacity, and actual utilization obtained; range from 68.966 ‐–94.118%, 0.5––3 kg/hr, 6–36 kg/12 h, 0.083–0.083(8.3%) respectively. These evaluating parameters were signi ﬁcantly affected by the operational fac- tors atP< 0.05. Optimum values obtained are 92%, 2.689 kg/h, 32.781 kg/12 h for impurity separating: ef ﬁciency, throughput, and maximum capacity respectively. The prediction interval test shows that the validation experi-mental mean result lies within calculated prediction intervals. Regression analysis shows a 0.9(90%) coef ﬁcient of determination between the model predictions and the validation experimental results. The developed devicewas recommended to always operate at a metering speed of 20 rpm for optimum performance.© 2021 The Authors.

1. IntroductionCowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp) is one of the most ancient human protein food sources and has existed as a crop since Neolithictimes. It is used for both consumptions and as industrial raw materialfor other products. The world produces over 8 million tones of dry cow-pea seed yearly; with 90% percent of the production from Africa andAsia. America and Europe are the largest exporters, though being theleast producers. This is because Asia and African producing countriescan not meet international export standards ( Henshaw, 2008,IITA, 2015,ACB, 2015,Snapp et al., 2018,Rawal and Navarro, 2019, FAOSTAT, 2020,FAO, 2021). This study's goal is to change that trend,by developing an automated cowpea seeds quality detecting and sepa-rating device for less developed producing countries.Automation is the term used to describe an operation that requiresless or no human involvement. In crop processing, a lot of the automa-tion activity involves machine vision. According to tech brief (2019) ma-chine vision automation is bring a never seen before solution to humanproblems. Machine vision involves the use of image sensors to detectmaterials and separate them. The use of machine vision to automateagricultural grains and seed processing operations has been carriedout by various researchers.Casady and Paulsen (1989)developed a ma- chine vision automated maize corn positioning system with an error-free of 99%.Georg et al. (1995)developed an automatic machine visionfor broken and unbroken wheat kernel separating system with 95.8%accuracy.Wan (2002)developed an automatic image vision grainsorting system with 99% accuracy at 1296 kernels per minute usingtwo cameras. The system was tested with rice, wheat, jobstear, and sor-ghum kernels.Pearson (2009)developed a hardware-based image pro-cessing damaged grain sorting device. It was tested with Maize andwheat kernels with a throughput of 40 kg/h and 8 kg/h, with an accu-racy of 74 and 91% respectively.Pearson (2010)developed a low-cost high-speed machine vision grain damage sorter. The system was testedwith wheat, barley, durum, andﬂax seeds. Its throughput was found tobe 25 kg/h with an accuracy ranging from 92 to 96% depending on thegrain being sorted.Kirilova et al., 2013developed prototype image rec- ognition and grading system for damaged maize seeds. The system wastested and found to have sensitivity, speci ﬁcity, accuracy, and precision of 88.43, 93.88, 90.49, and 94.79%, respectively. Arkadiusz and Andrzej, 2018developed, a 2D machine vision, automated machine for diseasedrice sorting system using the rice shape and color. Injante et al., 2020de- veloped an automated image processing system for sorting lima beansto meet export standards.

None of these re-searchers during evaluation used I-optimal experimental design tomodel and optimize the operational capability of their developments.Modeling is the representation of concepts and happenings withinour natural world, to study and predict future instances. Optimizationis part of mathematical modeling (Zeigler et al., 2018).Dantzig (2014) andAl-Baali et al. (2018),d eﬁne numerical optimization as choosingthe best elements or factors among groups of elements considered.These choices must be done considering some sets of constraints orgoals set for the selection. In order words, optimization is ﬁnding the best available choices under certain conditions. There are different math-ematical approaches to achieve optimization. One of these approaches isResponse surface methodology. Response surface methodology (RSM) isa mathematical technique that develops an experimental design that canput together all the independent variables or factors and use the experi-mental outcome or results to produce equations that can be used to re-produce or predict the experimental results or outcome again. Thoughcomplex calculations (well-designed regression analysis) are involved,it is one of the efﬁcient ways of achieving optimization. Experimental de-signs developed during response surface optimization include CentralComposite Design (CCD); Box-Behnken (BB); Optimal Designs ( Stat- Ease, 2018;García and Peña, 2018;Makowski, 2020). The objective ofthis study is to develop, evaluate and optimize the operational capabilityof an automated device for quality detection and separation of cowpeaseeds to meet international export standards.2. Materials and methods2.1. Design of the automated deviceThe design of the automated device was divided into three catego-ries: metering unit, automation (artiﬁcial intelligence) unit, and con- veyor belt unit. The detailed design parameters, calculations, andreasons for selections are displayed in Tables S1, S2, S3, and S4 (supple-mentary tables). Written materials consulted during design include(Boumans, 1985,Srivastava et al., 2006,Yalcin, 2007,Fenner Dunlop, 2009,Sharma and Mukesh, 2010,Dunlop, 2016,O'Keefe, 2017,Tech Briefs, 2019,Habasit Fabric Conveyor Belt Engineering Guide, 2021 )2.2. Automated device design components2.2.1. Metering unitThis consists of an 11 kg/s capacity hopper having a 120 mm dia-meter wooden metering disc (with 4 holes bored at equal interval)

241attached at the bottom (ﬁg. S1 in the supplementary document). Thismetering disc was powered with 2 hp. motor revolving at 1450 rev/min and link to a reduction gear with ratio 1:80. This reduction gear al-lows the seeds and impurity to be metered one at a time into the auto-mation unit. A 920 mm high standing frame was used to support theentire metering unit (Fig. S1a).2.2.2. Automation unitFig. 1displayed the automated unit. This consists of raspberry pi3 board model B with a Pi camera board attached placed inside arectangular plastic box (Fig. 1a). This box is covered with a 5 in.TFT screen which was also connected to the raspberry pi board(Fig. 1b and c). The box is then attached to a 90 mm length PVCpipe. The inside of the pipe is divided into two compartments sepa-rated with two circular plasticﬂippers forming the bases. Thesesﬂippers are attached to two micro servo SG 90 motor whichﬂip them 90
oinside the PVC pipe. The inside of the two (primary andsecondary) compartments were lit up by LED lights also connectedto the raspberry pi board. Adaptor power cable was used to powerthe raspberry pi board. The PVC pipe had two outlets at its end forr e j e c t e da n da c c e p t e dm a t e r i a l s .2.2.3. Conveyor belt outlet unitThis consists of belt carcass type of PN (polyester and Nylon)plain weave (DIN code EP) with strength range of 315 –2000 kN/m (150–400 kn/m/ply). The belt has a carry capacity of 1000 kg/m
3,with length and width of 1300 mm and 250 mm respectively. Thebelt pulley dimensions are shown inﬁg. S1b (supplementary docu- ment).2.3. Programming of automated unitThe Raspberry pi board operational system software wasdownloaded from the Raspberry pi organization website ( https:// www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/). The operating system softwarewas installed as instructed by the company. After installation of theoperating system, other devices like the Raspberry pi camera andthe TFT screen was attached and their application softwaredownloaded from their respective company websites. These appli-cations software were also installed on the Raspberry pi board ac-cording to installation instructions. The Raspberry pi camera wasnow used to take 150,000 images each for good seeds and impuri-ties (Program S1 in the supplementary document). Some picturescaptured by the pi camera used for the automation are displayedinFig. 2. These captured images was now saved on the Raspberrypi board and then uploaded into a la ptop. These images were there- after uploaded into python software. The program (which is the ar-tiﬁcial intelligence part) that was developed by the pythonsoftware; used for comparing incoming image with stored imageon the Raspberry pi board are displayed in Program S2 in the sup-plementary document. After developing the python programs, it isthen transferred into the Raspberry pi board.

2422.4. Operational procedure of the automated deviceThe operationalﬂow diagram of the separating procedures isdisplayed inFig. 3. The device wasﬁrst turned on. Then material to bedetected and separated was introduced as input into the metering de-vice hopper. Then metering drum at the end of the hopper, introducedit into the automation unit, one after the other. As the material passedinto the automation units, motion and proximity sensors from the Rasp-berry Pi camera board detect its presence. When the material fell intotheﬁrst detection chamber called the primary grain collector (compart-ment). This primary grain collecting chamber (compartment) was wellilluminated by LED light bulbs (Fig. 2). The LED light bulbs were con- nected to the Pi camera board and come on when the automation deviceis turned on. The image photograph of the material was taken by the picamera sensors in the primary collection chamber (compartment). Thisimage was sent to the Raspberry pi board to be processed and comparedit to previous images loaded into the board memory. The Raspberry piboard then activates the circular bottom plastic ﬂipper (actuator) of the primary collection chamber (compartment) to rotate 90 degrees.This action allowed the material to move to the second chamber (com-partment) called the secondary grain collection chamber (compart-ment). This chamber also was illuminated by LED light bulbs. In thesecondary grain chamber (compartment), separation decisions aremade. This decision was made using arti ﬁcial intelligence program (see programs S1 and S2 in the supplementary material) developedby python program software, inputted into the Raspberry pi board.After comparing the taken image to the stored images, the Raspberrypi board automatically activates the actuator. The actuator here wasthe circular plasticﬂipper bottom of the secondary grain collectingchamber (compartment). This circular bottom ﬂipped eitherﬂipped 90 degrees to the left or 90 degrees to the right. Each ﬂipping of the bot- tom directs the material to either of the two outlet pipes. The outletpipes are called the“Accepted and“Rejected”outlets. Materials move from the outlets onto the conveyor belt. These materials either fall tothe right or left on the belt. The belt conveys them to another two out-lets at the end of the conveyor belt. A well labeled diagram of the com-plete assembled setup of the cowpea quality detection and separationdevice is shown inFig. 4.2.5. Evaluation techniqueThree good quality cowpea seed varieties namely: NG/AD/11/08/0033, NG/OA/11/08/063, and NGB/OG/0055 samples were obtained atthe National Center for Genetic Resources and Biotechnology(NACGRAB), Ibadan, Nigeria.

243Table 1. Images of impurities (bad portion) used in this study to mixwith good seeds (good portion) are displayed in Fig. 5. These impurities are made up of:a) Damaged seeds - cowpea seeds exposed to natural environment forsix months for it to be both insect and fungal affected ( Fig. 5aa n db ) b) Broken seeds–Crushed cowpea seeds (Fig. 5c) c) Foreign body - Stones (ranging from 6 to 10 mm in diameter)(Fig. 5d)To evaluate the device (machine) performance, a 2 kg of an ex-perimental sample (good + bad por tion), made up of different va- rieties and quality grades (percentage of impurity: grade 1, 2, and3) was poured into the metering hopper. This was metering atspeeds of 12, 16, and 20 rpm. Separated samples were collected atthe rejected and accepted outlets of the belt conveyor. Both sepa-rated samples that were collected from the outlets at the end ofeach run (experiment). Were further hand sorted into goodseeds, broken seeds, foreign body, and damaged seeds. They werethen weighed and recorded. The time for each experimental runwas also taken and recorded. Evaluation parameters were calcu-lated as displayed by eqs.(1)–(5):A.

245will produce maximum impurity separation ef ﬁciency, throughput, and capacity. Validation on the device was done using two statisti-cal analyses: The regression analysis test and the Prediction intervaltest.3. Results and discussion3.1. EvaluationThe experimental results obtained during the evaluation are showninTable 2. Summary of the modeling activity were displayed in Table 3. Impurity separation efﬁciency obtained during evaluation range from68.966–94.118% with a mean result of 82.758%. The standard deviationof the experiment was 7.479%. A low standard deviation value of 7.479%shows that majority of the impurity separation ef ﬁciency results ob- tained are close to the mean result of 82.752%. This is good, owning tothe fact that constant operational high separating ef ﬁciency is a desir- able characteristic for a quality control device. Similar separating accu-racies ranges had been achieved byCasady and Paulsen (1989),Georg et al. (1995),Wan (2002),Pearson (2009),Pearson (2010),Kirilova et al. (2013),Arkadiusz and Andrzej (2018)andInjante et al. (2020) for other grains and seeds. Impurity separating throughput results ob-tained range from 0.5–3 kg/h with a mean result of 1.352 kg/h. The stan-dard deviation of the experiment was 0.777 kg/h. A low standarddeviation also signiﬁes that the majority of the results obtained do notspread along with the range but concentrate around the mean through-put of 1.352. This is also a good quality for predicting device perfor-mance. Similar throughput results ranges for other grains and seedswere reported byWan (2002),Pearson (2009),a n dPearson (2010). The maximum impurity separation capacity results obtained rangefrom 6 to 36 kg/12 h. The mean value obtained was 16.404 kg/12 hwith an experimental mean deviation of 9.473 kg/12 h. A low standarddeviation value of 9.473 kg/12 h shows that majority of the maximumimpurity separation capacity results obtained are close to the mean re-sult of 16.404 kg/12 h. This knowledge can help the operator schedulehis working hours and cost of operation. The actual Utilization capacityresults obtain for the device were 0.083 (8.3%) all through theexperiments. This is because a constant sample weight of 2 kg wasused throughout the evaluation experiments. 2 kg represent 8.3% ofthe device material carrying and processing capacity at a time. Fromthis information, this study deduced that the device can carry and pro-cess 24 kg (100% utilization) at a time.3.2. Effects of operational factors on evaluation parametersThe effects of operational factors like speed of metering, variety, andgrade of the sample used; on evaluation parameters like separating ef ﬁ- ciency, throughput, and maximum capacity are displayed graphically inFig. 6 and 7. A 2D plot of separating efﬁciency on metering speed shows a quadratic relationship (Fig. 6a). This plot shows that an increase inseed metering speed reduced the separating ef ﬁciency to a point. Then further increments start to increase the ef ﬁciency. This phenomenon can be attributed, to the image processing time. The programmedimage comparing time was set forﬁve second (Program S2). So, increas-ing the speed of seed metering (feed rate) will lead to having more
seeds in the separating chambers. This can lead to wrong decision dur-ing comparing acquired image to stored image, therefore reducing sep-aration efﬁciency. Similar observation was mentioned by Pearson et al., 2008during his evaluation of a developed color image based sorter forseparating red and white wheat. They also notice that increasing thefederate affected the sorting accuracy of wheat seeds from its impurity.So therefore, this study recommends that to increase separation ef ﬁ- ciency the metering speed should be reduced from its design meteringspeed of 15 rpm. A 3D graph of separating ef ﬁciency on variety and grade shows that; NG/AD/11/08/0033 (small white seeds) has thehighest separating efﬁciency and NGB/OG/0055 (red seeds) the lowest(Fig. 7a). This trend can be explained to be caused by the bright whitecolors and the small sizes of NG/AD/11/08/0033 variety. Its colormakes it easier to detect by the pi camera while its size allows it to bemetered faster. The NGB/OG/0055 (red seeds) variety color delay dur-ing its detection, which could be due to colour spectrum band differ-ences. Similar condition was reported by Pasikatan and Dowell (2003), during evaluation of a high speed sorter for separating impurityin white and red wheat. The sorting sensitivity and accuracy was less for

246the red wheat blend than for the white. This study had therefore shownthat the developed device separate white cowpea better than red. A plotof the device throughput with metering speed shows a linear relation-ship (Fig. 6b). Throughput increases as metering speeds are increased.This behavior can be explained from the point of view that increasingthe metering speed increase the number of material introduced intothe automated unit in one hour. So therefore, more impurities are likelyto be a separation in one hour.Kawusara (2019)andInjante et al. (2020)also reported similar observation during evaluation and testingof their image processing devices for cowpea and lima beans respec-tively. Although throughput range of 0.5 –3 kg/h obtained is low com- pare to that obtained by previous researchers for other grains andseeds. To improve this, then the use of a higher version of the raspberryboard with lesser decision time (processing speed) with HD camera isrecommends. A 3D plot of throughput on variety and grade showsthat; NG/OA/11/08/063 has the highest throughput and NGB/OG/0055the lowest; grade 3 has the highest throughput and grade 1 the lowest(Fig. 7b). This could be because NG/OA/11/08/063 variety has a veryTable 3Summary of modeling of automation device evaluation parameter.Software: Design Expert Version 10Study Type: Response SurfaceDesign Type: I-optimalSubtype: RandomizedBlocks: No BlocksFactor Units Type Subtype Mi ⁎Max⁎Coded Values Mean Std.

248maximum capacity on variety and grade behaviors similar to that ofthroughput plot on variety and grade ( Fig. 7c). Similar explanations given to throughput graphs can also be used for the maximum capacity.3.3. Modeling and optimizationFive polynomial equations were considered for modeling and opti-mization of evaluation parameters as shown in table S5 (Supplementarytable). These equations were: linear, 2 factors interaction (2FI), qua-dratic (2 order polynomial), and cubic (3 order polynomial). A quadraticequation model was chosen for separating ef ﬁciency. This choice was base on the fact that among the model equations tested. The quadraticequation had the highest: lack ofﬁtp-value (a value that describes whether the equation adequately describes the relationship betweenthe variables); adjusted R-square (how close are the data results closeto the regression line adjusted for the predictors) and predicted R-square (how well are predicted values close to the experimentalvalues). Linear equation models were chosen for modeling and optimi-zation of separating throughput and maximum separating capacity. Thischoice was base on the fact that among the polynomials tested. The lin-ear equation had the highest sequential p-value (the probability thatthe terms are not modeling noise) and predicted R-square. These twomodel equations were used to optimize the evaluation parameters,butﬁrst the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and statistic parameterswere calculated. The ANOVA, statistical parameters, and model equationterms for the evaluation parameters are displayed in tables S6, 7, and 8(supplementary tables). ANOVA shows that all developed models forevaluating parameters were all signiﬁcant atP< 0.05 while their lack ﬁt were not signiﬁcant at P < 0.05 (table S6). These are good indicationof a very good predictive model. Table S7 shows the statistical quality ofthe developed equations. These statistic range are standard deviations(0–4.306), coefﬁcient of variation (CV) (0 –26.249), PRESS (0–654.111),−2 Log Likelihood (9–137.087), R-Squared (0.8–0.985), Adjusted R-Squared (0.7–0.965), Predicted R-Squared (0.5 –0.876), Ad- equate Precision (14–22.924), Bayesian information criterion (BIC)(29–156.401) and Akaike information criterion (AIC) (26 –153.754). These modeling statistic ranges show that the developed models canbe used to accurately optimize the evaluation parameters of the devel-oped device at 95% conﬁdent level. Model equations are displayed intable S8 (supplementary table).The optimum solutions obtained from optimizing the device opera-tions are displayed inTable 4. The goals of the optimization were toachieve maximum separating: efﬁciency, throughput, and capacity.This was done within the experimental ranges of metering speed, vari-ety, and grades used in this study. Nine optimum solutions wereachieved. The automation device achieved its highest separating ef ﬁ- ciency (92%) when processing NG/AD/11/08/0033 variety of grade 1with a metering speed of 20 rpm (solution 5 in Table 4). Maximumseparating throughput (2.689 kg/h) was achieved when processingNG/OA/11/08/063 variety of grade 3 with a metering speed of 20 rpm(solution 3 inTable 4
). Maximum separating capacity (32.781 kg/12 h) was achieved when processing NG/OA/11/08/063 variety ofgrade 3 with a metering speed of 20 rpm (solution 3 in Table 4). More

249choices can be made fromTable 4, depending on operational goals. Alloptimal results were obtained at a metering speed of 20 rpm. Thismeans that the automated device should not be operated below orabove a metering speed of 20 rpm.3.4. ValidationPrediction interval (PI) statistical analysis test was done to validatethe prediction ability of the models used; for optimizing separating ef ﬁ- ciency, separating throughput, and maximum separating capacity. Themean validation results were displayed in Table 5(full results are displayed in table S9 in supplementary material). The analysis showsthat the mean validation experimental results obtained; for separatingefﬁciency, separating throughput, and maximum separating capacityall lay between calculated low 95% prediction intervals (95% PI) and cal-culated high 95% prediction intervals (95% PI). This indicates that themodels are predicting within a statistically expected range. Further-more, a regression analysis was also done to validate the predictive abil-ity of the models (Fig. 8). A regression graph between the predictedresults was plotted against validation experimental results. This graphsshow coefﬁcient of determination (R
2) value of 0.892 (89.2%) for sepa- rating efﬁciency, 0.738 (73.8%) for separating throughput, and 0.989(98.9%) for maximum separating capacity. These values show that thedeveloped models used for optimization predictions were within therange of 73–93% accurate and precise.4. ConclusionsAn automated (artiﬁcially intelligent) quality separating device wasdeveloped with three units. These units are the metering, automating,and belt conveying outlet. To evaluate the device; its separating ef ﬁ- ciency, throughput, and maximum capacity were modeled and opti-mized. An optimal: impurity separating ef ﬁciency of 92%, impurity separating throughput of 2.689 kg/h, and maximum impurity separat-ing capacity of 32.781 kg/12 h were achieved. The effects of operatingfactors like cowpea variety, cowpea export grades, and meteringspeed on device evaluation parameters like impurity separating: ef ﬁ- ciency, throughput, and maximum capacity were established. It wasalso established that the metering speed of the device should not gobelow or above 20 rpm for optimal impurity separating results. This ar-tiﬁcially intelligent (smart) device can also be used in cowpea seedsgrading processing line to achieve cowpea seeds export grade quality.Declaration of Competing InterestThere is no conﬂict of interest what so ever between co-author andme.
