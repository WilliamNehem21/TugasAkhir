based on the spatial correlation algorithm, such as dist ributed Bayesian fault tolerant detection algorithm (BFTD) [2]. However, BFTD frequent communication between adjacent nodes, that leads the energy consume fast .A-SMAC protocol based on data traffic dynamic adjustment to listen and sleep time. A-SMAC protocol does not contribute to the reliability of the underlying data judgment. Usually send out unreliable information, result in wrong decision to Fusion Center. In this paper, we present an adaptive fault tolera nt algorithm (AFTA).Through the Threshold Area Decision Scheme [3], using the data correlation, reali ze the combination of underlying data fault-tolerant verdict and A-SMAC protocol. We adopt the simulation shown the values of slow ch anges in the monitor environments, the AFTA could improve the efficiency of valid data delivery and reduce the unnecessary data to send. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows . Section 2 presents Time Correlation Fault-tolerant algorithm. Adaptive listening dormancy discussed in Section 3. Section 4 described our simulation results. Section 5 concludes the paper. 2. Fault-tolerant Based on Time Correlation 2.1.

If suddenly change, a binary decision sent three tim es in a row, is to improve the node number of sent packets. In MAC layer, A-SMAC protocol according to the node throughput dynamic adjustment to listen and sleep time. So it can transmit the information in a timely manner. 3. Adaptive Listening Dormancy Scheme 3.1. A-SMAC protocol principle  A-SMAC protocol is based on the SMAC protocol im proved, such as propose in [8,9]. A-SMAC protocol has adaptive listening scheme could according to the va lue of the node throughput to predict the change of network traffic. 3.2. A-SMAC protocol working process A-SMAC protocol could base on the node throughput  to measure the size of network traffic. Set the parameters used for statistical nodes in each cycle to send and receive packets number. We adopt the two threshold method (respectively set as S, M) can be divided n into three kinds of circumstances. And in these three cases,

out in time, reduce the decision delay data. 4. Results of Simulation Analysis In order to compare the AFTA and Bayesian algorithm .We use theNS-2.35 emulator as experimental 64   Yun Liu and Hongzhi Zhou  /  AASRI Procedia   6  ( 2014 )  59 – 65

Fig.4.2 shows error reduction performance of AFTA. We ca n seen from the diagram when data acquisition number L take more than three times, the AFTA is supe rior to using spatial correlation of (adjacent nodes N = 4)Bayesian fault tolerance detection algorithm at error reduction. 5. Conclusions Energy consumption and event monitoring has been one of the important indices for wireless sensor network performance .In this paper, AFTA is proposed. This approach  require data time correlation to fault tolerance through Threshold area. The proposed ap proach also determines the combination of algorithm and A - SMAC protocol. The simulation results demonstrate that this approach can significantly reduce the unnecessary data to send and lead energy consumption is lower than A-SMAC pr otocol. It is also shown that the AFTA improve the ruling data transmission efficiency effectively, makes the system has a higher real-time performance and reliability is better. As a future extension, AFTA approach can be developed that can be used for even larger networks. References [1] Ying Zhang, Shashidhar Gandham, and Qingfeng H.
