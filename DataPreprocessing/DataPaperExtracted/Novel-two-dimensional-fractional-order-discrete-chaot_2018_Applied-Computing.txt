1. IntroductionIn the past decade, the discrete dynamic behavior and its appli-cations has been given a lot of attention in various applied areasowing to its potential applications in secure communication ﬁeld[1,2]. On the basis of the time scale theory [3], Atici et al. has pro- posed the discrete fractional calculus (DFC) [4–6]to describe the dynamics of the discrete time, some results have been reported.The discrete memory effect of the system indicates that themomentumxðnÞdepends on the past informationxð0Þ;...;xðn/C01Þ. There are many methods designed for the frac-tional difference models to prove that the DFC is an efﬁcient toolto discretize the chaotic systems with a memory effect [10–12]. Wu and Baleanu[13–15]focus on applications of the discrete frac-tional calculus on an arbitrary time scale and utilized the theoriesof delta difference equations to reveal the discrete chaos behavior.In order to understand the background of the discrete dynamicsbehaviors, our primary objective is to introduce applications of thediscrete fractional calculus on an arbitrary time scale [4–6]and uti- lize the theories of delta difference equations to expose the dis-crete chaos behaviors of the fractionalized map. Some othersrefer to the applications of fractional fourier transform and frac-tional differential equations[7–9].Public key cryptography (asymmetric cryptography) is a famoustechniques for many years[16]. Strong public-key cryptography isoften considered to be too computationally expensive for smalldevices if not accelerated by cryptographic hardware. Ellipticcurves are popular settings for building efﬁcient public key cryp-tosystems. Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) is an popular effectivepublic key cryptography techniques. ECC has many advantages,such as small storage capacity, faster computations and reductionof the power consumption[17]. Menezes Vanstone Elliptic CurveCryptosystem (MVECC) was one of the famous techniques thatused ECC and gave security for the data [18]. We take use of this technique in our paper and make it more adapted to image encryp-tion and security.There are many encryption methods proposed recently, such as[19–24]. Some others make use of fractional differential equation,like fractional logistic maps[25], fractional-order chaos systems[26]and fractional form of hyperchaotic system [27].I n[28], fractional-order difference has been proposed to apply in theimage encryption based on fractional chaotic time series, whilethe new encryption method which utilizes two dimensional chao-tic map based on fractional-order difference has seldom beenproposed.Our main aim is to introduce a new two dimensional discretechaotic map on the basis of fractional-order difference and applythe map to information security. The paper is organized as follows:In Section2, the deﬁnitions and the properties of the DFC are

introduced. In Section3, we provide the introduction of ellipticcurve in ﬁnite ﬁeld. The working mechanism of the Menezes-Vanstone Elliptic Curve Cryptosystem is described in Section 4. Then, in the next section, we present fractional 2D-TFCDM andstandard map on time scales from the discrete integral expression.The bifurcation diagrams, the largest Lyapunov exponent plot andthe phase portraits of the map are also displayed while the differ-ence orders and the initial points are changed. In Section 6, we dis- play the applications of fractional 2D-TFCDM with the Menezes-Vanstone Elliptic Curve Cryptosystem in the image encryption. InSection7, the results of applications in part VI are analyzed. At last,some conclusions are given.2. PreliminariesFirst, let us brieﬂy revisit the deﬁnitions of the fractional sumand difference.

The original, encryption and decryption of a image are shown inFig. 9(a), (b) and (c) as Lena, the ﬁgure size is 512 /C2512. Another 4 cases are displayed insupplementary material. In the process of encryption and decryption of Section 6.3, the keys are the same. Moreover, owing to the coupling structure ofthe algorithm, the chaotic sequences depend on each other. Thesefeatures strengthen the encryption algorithm security, and makethe encryption algorithm more robust.

Statistics analysisThe statistical property is signiﬁcant to an encrypted image anda good encryption method should be robust against any statisticalattacks.7.2.1. Correlation of the plain and cipher imagesIn an ordinary image, the correlation coefﬁcient of adjacent pix-els is always high for the reason that the adjacent pixels values areclose. A good encryption algorithm should make the correlation ofadjacent pixels nearly equal to zero. The correlation coefﬁcients arecalculated in vertical, horizontal and diagonal directions by Eq.(25), then the results are displayed inTable 1. The correlation in the original ﬁgure and the encrypted ﬁgure of Lena along the xdirections are shown inFig. 10.rxy¼jcovðx;yÞjﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃDðxÞp ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃDðyÞp ð25Þco

It is evident to see that the correlation of original image has alinear relationship, while that of the encrypted image is stochastic.Table 1indicates that the correlation coefﬁcients of encryptedimage are nearly 0, compared with the correlation coefﬁcients oforiginal image are all bigger than 0.9, some one is nearly 1. It canbe concluded that the encryption process makes the pixels of theimage almost independent with each other.

Xia / Applied Computing and Informatics 14 (2018) 177–185InTable 2, it can be observed from the statistical data that theproposed scheme are better than the encryption method proposedin other references.7.2.2. HistogramThe distribution of colors inside the image is described by thehistogram. An ordinary image has the regular histogram and itcan provide the attackers with effective information. Consequently,the colors inside the encrypted image should be uniformly dis-tributed with a good image encryption method. Fig. 11shows the histogram of Airplane in original, encrypted and decrypted 3stages.Obviously, the histogram of encrypted image is nearly uni-formly distributed compared with the histogram of original image,so that the encryption method can resist statistical attack.7.2.3. Information entropyEntropy is a measure of unpredictability of information content.The information entropy is the most important characteristic ofrandomness and it is used to indicate the degree of uncertaintyof a system. It is deﬁned as:
HðmÞ¼1NX2n/C01i¼0pðm iÞlog21pðm
iÞð29Þ
wherepðm iÞexpresses the probability of symbol m. For the pixels, values of the image are between 0 /C24255. According to Eq.(29), the ideal information entropy is 8 bits for an ideally random image.Therefore, the closer to 8 bits the information entropy, the betterthe encryption scheme. The information entropy of the encryptedimages are shown inTable 3.
Table 4gives the comparison of information entropy. In con-trast with other algorithms, the result implies that the encryptedimages of proposed algorithm are closer to the random images.All the above is enough to prove that the proposed encryptionmethod has the ability to resist statistical attack.7.3. Sensitivity analysisThere are two different criteria for measuring the rangebetween two images: Number of pixels change rate (NPCR) anduniﬁed average changing intensity (UACI), as deﬁned by Eqs.

Table 5present the result of comparison of key spaces. InTable 6, It can be observed that all NPCR are higher than 95% as well as near to the ideal value99.61%, most of UACI are near to the ideal value 33.46%. We cannotrecognize the object insideFig. 12(b)–(f), therefore the encryptionmethod is sensitive to the secret keys.7.3.2. Plaintext sensitivityA good encryption method should ensure that the twoencrypted images are completely different even if the two originalﬁgures have only one pixel difference. Because of that the attackers

Liu, T. Xia / Applied Computing and Informatics 14 (2018) 177–185can obtain informations by encrypting two original images of onepixel difference and comparing the two encrypted images.The results are shown inTable 7,Fig. 9(a)ðx;yÞindicates that the pixel value of coordinateðx;yÞis changed inFig. 9(a) as the original image and then encrypted by the proposed encryptionmethod, the NPCR and UACI are calculated with the formulas(31) and (32).FromTable 7, the NPCR and UACI of encrypted images with 2round encryption are all near to the ideal value 99 :61%and 33:46%, respectively. As a consequence, the encryption methodhas good property in plaintext sensitivity.Table 8compares the proposed encryption method with othermethods by computing the NPCR and UACI. It is obvious that ourmethod is more superior than other method.7.4. Resistance to known-plaintext and chosen-plaintext attacksIn Section6.3, the last round encrypted image pixel can deter-mine the iteration times of the next round. In Eq. (22),x
2ðiÞ, pro- duced from the fractional 2D-TFCDM, dependent on the iterationtimeskði/C01Þ, determines the iteration timeskðiÞ. Therefore, the corresponding keystream is not the same when different plaintextare encrypted. By encrypting some special images, the attackercannot obtain useful information since the resultant informationis related to those chosen-images. In consequence, the attacks pro-posed in Refs.[33–35]become ineffective on this new scheme. Theproposed scheme can primely resist the known-plaintext and thechosen-plaintext attacks.8. ConclusionFractional 2D-TFCDM is obtained from the 2D-TFCDM. Then,new chaotic dynamics behaviors is found with the map. Further-more, the map can be applied in encryption and decryption ofimage transmission in information security. The results show thatthe DFC is an efﬁcient tool for fractional generations of the discretemaps. We believe that the fractional calculus methods and frac-tional discrete formula will give us a better description of discretefractional dynamics in future. From our research, we discoveredthat no paper has been reported on information security of frac-tional difference.AcknowledgmentThe Project supported by the Natural Science Foundation ofChina (Grant Nos. 61072147, 11271008).Appendix A.
