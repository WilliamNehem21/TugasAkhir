 Abstract 
The UL21 protein of duck virus enteritis is analyzed by mean s of some software and online tools. The physicochemical properties results showed that the DEV UL21 product is a st able protein which consists of 561 amino acids and contain 27 potential phosphorylation sites, 3 potential glycosylation sites at aa residues 2, 172, 522. Both the signal peptide and the transmembrance region are not found. The secondary structure results revealed that UL21 protein is composed of 44.56% Alpha helix (h), 13.55% extended strand (e) and 41.89% random coil (c), respectively. In addition, the protein subcellular localization mainly locates at cytoplasmic with 65.2%, nuclear with 17.4 %. The phylogenetic tree and amino acid sequence comparison analysis revealed DEV UL21 protein is conserved and most closely related to Varicellovirus and Mardivirus. These results provided rational data to elucidate biological function and physiological features of the UL21 gene.

 1. Introduction Duck Virus Enteritis(DVE), also called Duck Plague(DP), is  a serious, contagious viral disease, and highly lethal in all ages of Anseriformes. The mortality an d reduction in egg production in commercial caused significant economic losses[1-2]. Duck enteritis virus (DEV) is a member of the Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily, but it has not been divided into any genus according to the Eighth International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) [3]. Previous researches focused on the epidemiology, diagnosis, prevention, the structure and morphogenesis of DEV[4-7]ˈbut now, more about the DEV gene expression, protein purification, protein function, detective studies have reported with molecular biology technology[8-10]. Different herpesvirus have similar structure. The herpe s simplex virion has four components: core, capsid, tegument and the envelope. The tegument which links the capsid and the envelope, composed of a multitude of about 20 proteins, including VP1/2 (UL36), VP11/12(UL46), VP13/14 (UL47), VP16 (UL48), VP22 (UL49), ICP0, ICP4, US2, US3, US10, US11, UL11, UL13, UL14, UL16, UL17, UL21, UL37, UL41, UL51 and UL56[11]. The HSV-1 UL21 gene product, a capsid-associated te gument protein, promotes the outgrowth of long cellular processes when it is over-expressed in non-ne ural cells. It is presumed that UL21 protein physically associates with microtubules[13]. The early reports sh owed that both  HSV and PRV UL21 gene products are not essential for viral replication in cultured cells and its  deletion resulted in only marginally reduced titers but clearly decreased plaque sizes[14-15]. The PrV UL21 gene  is a major determinant of PrV virulence, and its point mutations affecting the UL21 gene of live vaccine strain Bartha contribute to its attenuated phenotype[16]. In addition, PRV UL21 mutants which lacks UL21 gene has apparently reduced virulence for mice[17-18]. In short, the PRV UL21 protein associates wi th virulence. But as far, studies about DEV UL21 gene product are limited. The DEV CHv strain genome was identified and sequenced in our laboratory. In this paper, the product encoded by DEV-UL21 gene, which is presumed as a capsid-associated tegument protein, is analyzed by means of bioinformatics methods. These works may provide some information for further studies on DEV UL21gene. 2. Materials and methods 2.1.

2723H4313N765O841S24 containing 561 amino acids with a molecular mass of 61993.2 and an isoelectric point (pI) of 5.49. The total number of negatively charged re sidues (Asp + Glu) is 70, and the positively charged residues (Arg + Lys) is 57. The instability index (II) is computed to be 36.98, indicating that this classifies the protein as stable.  Some information about the DEV UL21 protein were obtained by some online tools (shown in table I): neither signal peptide nor transmembrane region was f ound in DEV UL21 protein the through online analysis; Phosphorylation sites analysis showed that there are 27 potential phosphorylation sites˄showed in Fig. 1a˅ when the threshold is above 0.5, including serine 13, threonine 9, tyrosine 5; the DEV UL21 protein hydrophobic amine acid district centered in aa 50-80, 120-170, 180-210, 280-300, 350-410, 420-440 and 480-500 (shown in Fig.1b); NetNGlyc1.0 analysis shows DEV UL21 protein contains 3 potential N-linked glycosylation sites at aa residues 2, 172, 522 when the threshold of prediction score is above 0.5 (shown in Fig.1c); Epitope analysis by Bepipred 1.0 server sh ows that DEV UL21 protein epitope was centred in aa residue 36-49, 100-121, 178-183, 217-224, 244-263, 273-281, 303-310, 338-346, 405-416, 452-462 and 475-128   Yong Shi et al.  /  AASRI Procedia   1  ( 2012 )  124 – 135 
 480; the futhur analysis by using Protean program of DNAStar 7.1 (showed in Fig.1d); the analysis of the UL21 protein subcellular localization indicates that it locates in cytoplasmic with 65.2%, nuclear with 17.4 % , mitochondrial with 8.7%, vacuolar with 4.3% and vesicles of secretory system with 4.3%. The prediction for DEV UL21 protein secondary structure is shown in Fig.2 and Fig3, the results suggest that of DEV UL21 protein consists of 44.56% Alpha helix (h), 13.55% extended strand (e) and 41.89% random coil (c) respectively. The Alpha helix of DEV UL21 protein is mainly located at aa 65-77, 119-143, 184-214, 341-353, 371-380, 422-451, 458-509, 521-534 and 544-556, Extended strand is mainly at aa 2-9, 14-19, 24-28, 295-300, 381-385, 393-403 and 417-421, the random coil are mainly situated in aa 36-44, 58-64, 97-107, 109-118, 215-254, 301-313, 404-415 and 534-543.

Amino acid sequence comparison among different DE V strain shows that the sequences of DEV CHv and VAC strain are identical, the UL21-like strain are similar with them except aa position 268, 436, 447 respectively(shown in Figure 4). Multiple sequences alignment of UL21 protein sequences we selected showed the conserved region of UL21 protein centred in aa 69-84, 93-103, 112-124, 174-189, 230-260, 274-283 and 335-341. 3.4. . Phylogenetic analysis about the UL21 protein sequence of  DEV and 25 referenceherpesviruses A phylogenetic tree wsa established based on UL21 pr otein sequence of DEV and those of 25 reference herpesviruses (display in Fig.6). The result shows there are 4 mainly branches: Varicellovirus, Mardivirus and DEV in a large branches; Simplexvirus, and Iltovi rus in a same branches; Betaherpesvirinae and Gammaherpesvirinae in other two branches respectively. The DEV are with MeHV-1, GaHV-2 and GaHV-3 in a monophyletic clade. Protein sequence comparison(s howed in Fig.7) by Clustal multiple revealed that DEV UL21 protein shares 26.4%, 27.3%, 26.2% similarity with GaHV-2, GaHV-3 , MeHV-1 and 33.0%, 132   Yong Shi et al.  /  AASRI Procedia   1  ( 2012 )  124 – 135 
 31.8%, 33.4%, 30.7% with EHV-1, EHV-4, EHV-9, FeHV-1 , respectively. So we can conclude that the UL21 protein of  DEV is most closely related to Varicellovirus and Mardivirus.

Fig.7 Identify analysis of the UL21 protein sequen ces of DEV and other 25 alphaherpesviruses by using DNAStar 7.1 multiple alignments. 4. Disccussion Previous reports about UL21 protein are mainly focused on the PRV and HSV-1.The UL21 protein is a tegument protein, and weakly associated with the capsid [13]. The deletion mutants which lacked the whole or partly UL21 gene sequences, were proved that UL21 protein  is dispensable for growth both in cultured cells or in vivo[14-15,19]. There is a complex interaction between the UL16 and UL21 tegument proteins in PRV and HSV-1[15,20-23]. In addition, the PRV UL21 ge ne product associates with virulence, and package pUL46, pUL49, and pUS3 efficiently[24]; the HSV-1 UL21 gene product associates with microtubules, indicating that the UL21 protein may have function of transport. All above revealed UL21 product of HSV and PRV is a regulateing protein. The UL21gene is conserved among herpes virions[25], and we presumed the product of DEV UL21 gene may have similar function. There are few reports about UL21 protein of DE V, so we study the DEV UL21 protein predicted information base on bioinformatics software and online tools. DEV UL21 protein doesn’t contain the signal peptide and the transembrance region, suggesting th e protein is not secreted protein or membrane glycoprotein. Protein phosphorylation on serine, threonine,  and tyrosine(Ser/Thr/Tyr) is generally considered the major regulatory posttranslational modification functional in prokaryotes[26]. There are 27 potential phosphorylation sites were found in DEV UL21 protein , which may associates wich regulateing function ,and the apparent molecular mass may be more than pr edicted value 61993.2. The analysis of the UL21 protein subcellular localization indicates that the UL21 gene pr oduct of DEV could both local in cytoplasmic and nuclear, which is similar with PRV and HSV-1 protein[13-14,17]. The secondary structure is related with protein fun ction. The alpha helix of the protein have higher chemical bonding energy, can firmly maintain proteinic high er structure. The alpha helix of the protein plays a important role in DNA binding motifs, but it seldom  become B cell epitopes because it is difficult to gomphosis antibody better, and usually locates at protein interior. Extended strand and random coil are more noncohesive flexibility structures and always include B cell dominant epitopes, because they are more loosen texture, which are easy to generate retortion and stretch out of the proteinic surface and gomphosis antibody[27-29]. DEV UL21 protein consists of 44.56% Alpha helix (h), 13.55% extended strand (e) and 41.89% random coil (c) respectively, indicating more extended strand and random coil structure may contain certain B cell epitopes. Previous results suggest th at herpes simplex tegument proteins are processed for antigen presentation in vivo and are possible candid ate compounds for herpes simplex vaccines[30], about 20 main antigenic determinants in epitope analysis fu rther suggests that UL21 protein is possible candidate compounds for  DEV vaccines to the preventio n and diagnosis of the duck virus enteritis. Amino acid sequence comparison among different DEV st rain shows that there may be light difference of UL21 protein among different DEV strains. We presumed the difference of identical gene may cause virulence diversity. The result of multiple sequences ali gnment of UL21 protein sequence of DEV, GaHV-2, GaHV-3, MeHV-1, HSV-1, EHV-1 and SuHV-1 supports that UL21 gene is conserved among Alphaherpesvirinae at least. From Fig.6, the established phylogenetic tree based on DEV CHv UL21 protein with its 25 reference herpesviruses and cluster analysis results show DEV has a close evolutionary relationship with GaHV-2, GaHV-3, MeHV-1, which belong to Mardivirus, but protein  sequence comparison showed in Fig.7 revealed similarity between DEV UL21 protein and Varicellovirus (including EHV-1, EHV-4, EHV-9 and FeHV-1) is higher than those between Mardivirus. It has reported DEV dUTPase gene product, gI, UL15, UL27, UL35 and UL55 proteins also have a close relationship with Ma rdivirus[10,31-35], we presumed DEV may be one 134   Yong Shi et al.  /  AASRI Procedia   1  ( 2012 )  124 – 135 
 member of  Mardivirus or belong to an individual ge nus within the Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily based on these results. More researches are required to define which genus of  herpesvirus the DEV belongs to. In short, bioinformatics analysis of DEV UL21 protein by some software and online tools provides some important information about the molecular characteristics.  Our work provided some basic information for the further DEV UL21 protein research.
