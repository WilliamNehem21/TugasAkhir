Article history:Received 19 August 2021Received in revised form 24 November 2021Accepted 25 November 2021Available online 27 November 2021Rapid socio-economic changes in China, such as land conversion and urbanization, are creating new scopes forthe application of precision agriculture (PA).An experiment to assess the economic bene ﬁts of two precision ag- riculture methods was applied for one year –precision seeding and precision seeding with land leveling. Whilst the results for this were positive, of itself it did not provide evidence of longer terms gains. The costs of land level-ing are accrued in a single year but the bene ﬁts could carry over into subsequent years. Thus, in this case if the PA method provides carry over beneﬁts to future years, the economic assessment would incorrectly assign all the costs to a single year of beneﬁts i.e.the beneﬁt-cost ratio would be underestimated. To gauge whether there was carry over beneﬁts in future years we looked at NDVI and GUI as proxies for future year bene ﬁts. For the sin- gle year experiment, our results showed that: (1) Winter wheat yield was increased 23.2% through the integra-tion of precision seeding and laser leveling technologies.(2) Both the single technology and the integratedtechnologies signiﬁcant reduced the concentration of soil ammonium nitrogen at the depths of 60 cm; (3) Thebeneﬁt/cost ratio's of the treatments exceeded that of the baseline by approximately 10% which translated toan increase of several hundred US$ per hectare. The NDVI analysis showed that the effect of laser land levelingcould last to the next two years. When considering the multi-year impact of land leveling, the bene ﬁt/cost ratio of PSLL will increase to 23.5% and 22.9% with and without laser land leveling subsidies. Making clear the eco-nomic beneﬁts of using PA technologies will likely promote application of the technologies in the region.© 2021 The Authors.

1. IntroductionIt has become increasingly challenging to produce more food withlimited land, water and environmental resources to meet the needs ofa rapidly growing population. The purpose of precision agriculture(PA) is to improve the economic and environmental bene ﬁts of agricul- ture and to reduce harm to the environment, under the premise of cropyield, quality and food safety (Cassman, 1999;Li, 2008;Gebbers and Adamchuk, 2010;Schieffer and Dillon, 2015). Current technologies of precision agriculture mainly involve the combined application of infor-mation technologies such as Remote Sensing (RS), Geographical infor-mation Systems (GIS), Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) andsensors placed on agricultural machines for laser land leveling, planting,variable rate fertilizer application, harvesting, and spraying, as well aswater-saving irrigation facilities. However, there are few studies aboutt h ee v a l u a t i o no fP Ai nt h eﬁeld. In China, the potential impacts of PA ap-plication in terms of yield, quality and farm incomes have not yet beenfully demonstrated which is likely an important factor constraining itspromotion (e.g.Kuehne et al., 2017).Seeding is the most important part of the crop production processsince it directly impacts germination, crop growth and yield, thus affect-ing crop productivity and the ensuing economic bene ﬁts (Ansari et al., 2006;Li et al., 2010). Precision seeding is the key to promoting PA, aswell as the prerequisite and basis for promoting other precision applica-tions: irrigation, fertilization, and harvesting ( Li et al., 2005). Precision seeding technology can not only improve the germination rate, saveseeds (Yazgi and Degirmencioglu, 2007;Karayel, 2009), optimize popu- lation density, and increase crop yields ( Giannini et al., 1967;Raoufat and Matbooei, 2007;Karayel, 2009), but also reduce labour inputssuch as thinning which all lead to improved farm incomes ( Zhao et al., 2010). A key determinant affecting seeding success is the quality ofland preparation (Ahmed et al., 2014). Laser land leveling machinesArtiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 6 (2022) 1 –9

In general, it can increase crop yields(Rickman et al., 1998;Jat et al., 2006), improve the efﬁciency of fertilizer and water use (Jat et al., 2006;Choudhary et al., 2000;Ahmed et al., 2014;Ashraf et al., 2017), and thereby increase economic beneﬁts (Jat et al., 2009;Ashraf et al., 2017). There are some concerns that laserland leveling affects the soil salinity and fertility of the soil since duringlaser land leveling some top soil is removed from the crest and moved tothe trough (Walker et al., 2003).Ashraf et al. (2017)indicated that there was no signiﬁcant difference for available nitrogen, phosphorous, potas-sium and organic matter in level and unlevel ﬁelds. Most previous research focus on the application effects and eco-nomic beneﬁts of applying one single technology with little research fo-cusing on integrated technologies. No attempt has been made to studythe effects on the integrated precision seeding and laser land levelingtechnologies in China. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the impactsof precision seeding and its integrated technologies with laser landleveling on the winter wheat yield, residual soil nitrogen and the result-ing economic beneﬁts. Winter wheat is a common crop in the centralplains of China. The experiments were conducted in Henan Provincein which the total wheat production and per unit yield are both thehighest in China. It further aims to study the carry over effect of theland leveling component. That is, the bene ﬁts of land leveling are still apparent 2–3 years after the initial cost of leveling.We report on a one year study of the inputs and outputs from trialsof precision seeding (PS), precision seeding with land leveling (PSLL)and compare the results with conventional farming. To capture thecarry over effect of land leveling, and to enhance the single year of eco-nomic data, we adopt remote sensing approach to capture its impact insubsequent years. Remote sensing technology can provides variousyield-directly related crop parameters for crop condition and yield fore-casting, such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), whichclosely related to the vegetation vigor, has been recognized for its abilityto monitor crops and as an estimator of crop yields since early 1980s(Bastiaanssen and Ali, 2003;Labus et al., 2002).2. Materials and methodsThe research method is composed of two parts: part one is to carryout a one-yearﬁeld experiment to obtain the yield, nitrogen residue ap-plication effect, economic beneﬁts of precision sowing, and laserﬂat + precision sowing; part two is to use the four-year remote sensing datato study the multi-year effect of laser leveling, and ﬁnally evaluate the economic beneﬁt obtained from the multi-year cost sharing correctiontest.

ow.2.1. Site descriptionsThe experimental work was undertaken at the 2011 National Collab-orative Innovation Pilot for Modern Agriculture (113°58 ′26″E, 34°12′ 06″N), located in Chang'ge City, Henan Province, China. This area typi-cally deploys a winter wheat-summer maize rotation. The north tem-perate continental monsoon climate dominates, with a mean annualtemperature of 14.3 °C, a mean annual rainfall of 711.1 mm, and amean annual frost-free period of 217days. The soil is medium textured:topsoil (0–20 cm) organic matter is 18.40 g kg
−1, alkali-hydrolyzable ni- trogen is 101.22 mg kg
−1, rapidly available phosphorus is 9.83 mg kg−1, rapidly available kalium is 98.44 mg kg
−1, and soil pH value is 7.65.2.2. Experiment designFig. 2shows theﬁeld layout of the experiment, the treatments andthe sampling points. The experiment comprised three land levelingand seeding treatments: precision seeding (PS), integrated precisionseeding and laser land leveling (PSLL), and local large-scale conven-tional farming (C). The size of the main plot was 300 m × 150 m withsub-plots of 50 m × 50 m. There were 18 sampling points in each treat-ment. PS equips conventional planters with a wheat seeding moni-toring system and a GPS navigation system developed by theNational Engineering Research Center for Agricultural InformationTechnology (NERCITA) for accurate seeding ( Fig. 3). This allows precision control of seeding evenness, and row straightness. The

21PJ-2500 laser land leveling machinery developed by NERCITA wasused for non-longitudinal cross slope leveling ( Fig. 4), with a width of 2.5 m and a leveling accuracy of 2 cm. Other treatments used con-ventional machines for land leveling.The winter wheat variety for testing was Xi Nong 979. It was plantedon October 5th, 2014. The seeding density of PS and PSLL were 195kg ha
−1, and C was 225 kg ha−1all with row spacing at 16.5 cm. Basefertilizer was applied at 750 kg ha
−1(N: P: K = 23:16: 6) and another225 kg ha
−1compound fertilizer was applied in early March 2015 fol-lowing rainfall in the jointing stage. The wheat was irrigated once onlyduring its growth period by local farmers using conventional hose sprin-klers (commonly known as the “little white dragon”)(Sui et al., 2005). The amount and timing of irrigation, fertilization, topdressing, sprayingand other management measures of the winter wheat during its grow-ing period were identical for all the three treatments. During October2014 to July 2017, laser land leveling and precision seeding was appliedonce in PSLL in October 2014.2.3. Sample collection and measurement methodFor each treatment there were 18 sampling points with a spacing of50 m × 50 m by a handheld GPS (Trimble Juno 3B). At maturity, thewheat was harvested manually at 1m
2around the sampling points.The grains were threshed using a plot thresher, dried in a batch graindryer and weighed. Grain yields of wheat was reported at 12% moisturecontent. Some of the grain was then crushed, mixed, sifted and mea-sured for the Kjeldahl nitrogen content by using the Kjeldahl method(Helrich, 1990), and further converted to crude grain protein contentwith a conversion factor of 6.25. Concurrently, soil samples weretaken from three spots randomly chosen around the sampling points,using an auger with a diameter of 5 cm to collect soil samples at 0 –60 cm soil depth (20 cm per layer), placed in a ziplock bag and broughtback to the lab. Soil moisture was measured in an oven at 105 °C. Nitrateand ammonium nitrogen were extracted from fresh soil by using 1 molL−1KCL solution. Soil nitrate and ammonium concentration were mea-sured using aﬂow analyzer (Seal AA3).2.4. Economics analysisThe economic analysis considered all inputs, including the servicecharge for cultivation, the cost of seed, fertilizer, pesticide (irrigationwater in the experimental area was free of charge) and farm manage-ment costs. Land preparation, planting, fertilizer and pesticide applica-tion, irrigation, and harvesting were all undertaken by agriculturalmachinery cooperatives and farmers' cooperatives. Thus, labour inputswere already included in these paid services. The farm belongs to

Net returns (NR) were calculated as the difference be-tween gross returns and the total cost of cultivation (NR = GR - TCC).The beneﬁt/cost ratio computed by dividing the GR TCC.2.5. Remote sense dataNDVI parameters during March to May can provide good estimatesof winter wheat condition and yield in the North China Plain ( Zhao et al., 2012). Given the aim of PSLL to produce a uniform seeding andgrowth we consider that PSLL will reduces spatial variability and accel-erates the crops growth than under conventional farming approaches.This study used a new remote sensing monitoring index-Growth Uni-formity Index (GUI) (SongXiaoyu, 2009) developed from NDVI to judge the growth condition levels of the wheat and to assess the carryover effects.2.5.1. Data collectionGF-1 satellite images from 2014 to 2017 covering the study areawere downloaded from the United States Geological Survey websiteand Land Observation Satellite Data Service Platform ( Table 1).2.5.2. Data processingWith the support of ENVI (The Environment for Visualizing Images),preprocessing of the GF-1 data included radiance calibration, atmo-spheric correction, RPC orthgraph correction and geometric correction.For the geometric corrections, high-deﬁnition digital images were se- lected as the base map, image to image method was used for correction.The NDVI value for the study area was calculated by the BandMath func-tion of ENVI. The NDVI was calculated from these individual measure-ments as follows:NDVI¼ ρNIR−ρR

Data analysisThe result of grain yield, crude protein and residual nitrogen wereshown to obey normal distributions. Data were subjected to analysisof variance (ANOVA) and analyzed using the general linear model pro-cedure of the Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS16.0). Treat-ment mean values were separated by Fischer's protected leastsigniﬁcant difference (LSD) test atP≤0.05.3. Results3.1. Grain yield and crude proteinA visualization of the experimental plot yields is shown in Fig. 5.O f all the 18 sampling points in each of the three treatments, 33% of PShad a grain yield higher than 8000 kg ha
−1compared to 83% of PSLL and only 22% of C. In terms of average yield, PS increased winterwheat grain yield by 7.8%, but the effect was not remarkably, whilePSLL signiﬁcantly increased by 23.2% (Fig. 6a). Average crude protein content of PS, PSLL and C were 13.6%, 13.6% and 13.7% respectively,the difference was not signiﬁcant (Fig. 6b).3.2. Residual nitrogenAfter the winter wheat harvest, soil residual nitrate nitrogen concen-tration decreased as soil depth increases, under all treatments ( Fig. 7a). However, compared with conventional farming, precision agriculturalpractices tend to have lower soil residual nitrate but this differencewas not signiﬁcant. Compared with C, the soil residual nitrate nitrogenconcentration at the depth of 0-60 cm in PS and PSLL was 7.9% and4.9% lower respectively.Soil residual ammonium nitrogen concentration at different soildepths was similar in all treatments ( Fig. 7b). It was slightly higher in soil at the 20-40 cm depth than other layers. Precision agricultural prac-tices signiﬁcantly reduced the soil ammonium nitrogen concentration(P≤0.05). PSLL was more effective than PS in reducing the soil ammo-nium nitrogen concentration. Soil ammonium nitrogen concentrationat the depth of 0-60 cm in PS and PSLL was reduced by 26.3% and38.2%, respectively, and there were no signi ﬁcant differences under the two treatments.3.3. Withinﬁeld spatial variabilityTable 2describes the differences between the plot treatments. Thecoefﬁcient of variation suggests that the within ﬁeld spatial variability of soil residual nitrate nitrogen and ammonium nitrogen (inorganic ni-trogen) concentration of 0–20 cm layer was much higher than that forprotein content or yield.

5has no signiﬁcant correlation with crop yield and protein content (R2< 0.3). Spatial variability of winter wheat yield is lower under PS and PSLL,compared with that under C, with the spatial variability of yield beingthe lowest under PS. PS and PSLL did not reduce the spatial variabilityof grain protein content and inorganic nitrogen concentration in thesurface soil (0–20 cm).3.4. Economic beneﬁtsEstimates of the inputs and their costs are shown in Table 3and the total costs and beneﬁts of the treatments are shown inTable 4. The total cost of cultivation for C were 1380.3 US$ ha
−1which were lower than those for PS and PSLL. Compared with C, PS and PSLL had additionalcosts of laser land leveling, seeding monitoring and GPS navigation.For this study, these costs were calculated as service charges, amongwhich the laser land leveling charge was 185.6US$ ha
−1, and seeding monitoring and GPS navigation charge was US$23.2 per hectare. TheChinese government currently subsidies laser land leveling. TakingTianjin for example, the rate of the government subsidy is US$116.0per hectare (Agricultural Bureau of Tianjin, 2015). Therefore, the fees of precision agriculture for PS and PSLL were 92.8US$ ha
−1with laser land leveling subsidies and 208.8US$ ha
−1without laser land leveling subsidies.As shown inTable 4, the beneﬁt/cost ratio of C is 1.95 (Gross Beniﬁt/ Total Cost of Cultivation). PS increased this by 7.3% to 2.09, while thecombined strategy of PSLL increased by 16.7% to 2.27 with laser landleveling subsidies or 8.1% to 2.11without the subsidies. Compared to C,the net return under PS increased by 15.5% (202.4 US$ ha−1). The in- crease under PSLL was over 40% with subsidies (546.4US$ ha
−1)o r over 30% (430.4 US$ ha
−1) without laser land leveling subsidies.3.5. Carry-over effectThe NDVI results using the GF-1 data are shown in Table 5. The coef- ﬁcient of variation (CV%) value of PSLL is lower than C in 2015 and 2017,are lower than PS in 2015–2017 suggesting a more consistent of the ex-periment results of crop yield, The CV value of PS is lower than C only in2015. These results are consistent with the GUI value. However, the PStreatment suffered serious pest attack in 2016, with the PSLL treatmentalso slightly affected, especially on the east side nearest to the PS treat-ment (PSLL is in the west of PS as shown in Fig. 2). Removing the east margin of PSLL affected by pests in 2016 from the analysis, the valueof C.V. and GUI of PSLL improved to 4.68% and 0.62 respectively whichsuperior to those for C. Therefore, it can be concluded from the aboveanalysis that applying laser land leveling in year one has positivecarry-over effects to at least the third year but that the effect of precisionseeding alone is unstable.Thus, in the case of considering the carry-over effect of laser landleveling, the cost of laser land leveling could shared equally of threeyears, then the beneﬁt/cost ratio of PSLL will increase by 20.9% to23.5% and by 21.1% to 22.9% with and without laser land levelingsubsidies.a) b) D

64. Discussion4.1. Grain yield and crude proteinOur results indicate that precision seeding and integration of preci-sion seeding and laser land leveling technologies could increase grainyield of winter wheat by 7.8% and 23.2%, respectively. These resultsare in agreement with previous studies that suggest crop yield increasesof 5% -40% through the application of precision seeding or laser landleveling technologies, as well as improving the ef ﬁciency of water and fer- tilizer usage (Li et al., 1999;Yao, 2004;Li et al., 2005;Jat et al., 2006, 2009; Hashimi et al., 2017). PSLL was more effective than PS in increasing theyield and is attributed to the following aspects. Firstly, laser land levelingimproves farmlandﬂatness (Aquino et al., 2015) which makes planting depth even, improves crop germination and its growth environment(Burce et al., 2013;Marlowe et al., 2013), and enhances the effect of pre- cision seeding. Secondly, precision seeding ensures the uniformity ofs e e d i n ga m o u n ta n dr o ws p a c e(Yazgi and Degirmencioglu, 2007), thus reducing re - seeding rate and lapsus seeding rate, improves germination,optimizes the crop population density, and the better effect of laser landleveling could be achieve. In summary, laser land leveling and precisionseeding complement each other are win-win for the crop yield. Cropgrain quality depends not only on its genotype, but also on the environ-ment and crop cultivation practices ( Souza et al., 2004;Otteson et al., 2008). The results of this study show that PS and PSLL had wheat proteincontent comparable to that from conventional farming.4.2. Residual nitrogenSoil nitrate and ammonium nitrogen residues after harvest increasethe risk of nitrogen leaching losses (Fang et al., 2006). Previous research has found that PA technologies, by increasing nitrogen utilization ef ﬁ- ciency, can reduce soil nitrogen residues ( Chen, 2003;Diacono et al., 2013). But there are also studies suggesting that PA technologies cannotreduce soil nitrate nitrogen residues ( Ferguson et al., 2002;Link et al., 2006). In this study, PS and PSLL tend to reduce the level of soil nitrateand ammonium nitrogen residues after the winter wheat harvest(Fig. 5). In particular, the two treatments signiﬁcantly affected the am- monium nitrogen concentration. The main reason is that the two PAtreatments signiﬁcantly increase wheat yields, which absorb more ni-trogen, thereby reducing the nitrogen residues ( Hatﬁeld, 2000; Thrikawala et al., 1999). PSLL was less effective than PS in reducing ni-trate nitrogen, mainly because the laser land leveling process compactsthe farmland with multiple passes of the machinery, increasing the soildensity, slowing down the moisture downward in ﬁltration (Ahmed et al., 2014), and resulting in retention of the nitrate nitrogen thatmoves easily with water in the surface soil. However, PSLL was more ef-fective than PS in reducing the ammonium nitrogen concentration,mainly because winter wheat grows better under PSLL, more nitrogenis absorbed and unlike nitrate nitrogen, ammonium nitrogen does notmove easily with water.4.3. Withinﬁeld spatial variability
NDVI perceive the temporal and spatial variability of wheat yield(Labus et al., 2002;Zhao et al., 2012;Lopresti and Bella, 2015), the value of the physiological indexes (C·V) of yield (experiments dataand NDVI perceive) shows that compared with conventional farming,PS and PSLL could reduce the spatial variability of winter wheat yieldin 2015. Precision seeding can improve the uniformity of the seeding(Arzu et al., 2007;Karayel, 2009;Zhao et al., 2014), and laser land level- ing can facilitate more uniform land for seeds, fertilizers, chemicals andother agricultural inputs (Brye et al., 2004;Ashraf et al., 2017). Both technologies contribute to reduce the spatial variability of winterwheat yield. But under laser land leveling, previous sub-surface soillayers may be exposed to the surface, and increase near-surface spatialvariability among soil chemical, physical, and biological properties(Brye et al., 2004;Aquino et al., 2015) which may be the reason ofTable 3Inputs and management measures.Management Input Unit PS PSLL CBasal dressing (compound fertilizer, N:P:K = 23:16:6) Amount of fertilizer Kg ha

7wheat yield spatial variability under PSLL is higher than under PS. And in2016 and 2017, the NDVI C.V of PSLL were lower than C, but that of PSwere not. Because a one-time application of laser land leveling lasts3–4 years (Ashraf et al., 2017;Aryal et al., 2015).4.4. Economic beneﬁtsThe economic impact of PA technologies on commodity crops withlow prices (such an wheat and maize) is generally positive. The net an-nual income, obtained from laser land level ﬁelds (two in rice-wheat ro- tation and three in the maize-wheat rotation), was 32% higher, ascompared to that from unlevelﬁelds (Ashraf et al., 2017). Experimental results in the rice-wheat rotationﬁeld show that the application of laserland leveling technology increases farmers' annual income by $145ha
−1(Jat et al., 2009). Application of multiple PA technologies canachieve higher earnings than single technology applications ( Finck, 1998;Lowenberg-De-Boer, 2000).Walker et al. (2003)andAbdullaev et al. (2007), however, reported that the net income was negative dur-ing theﬁrst year mainly because of cost incurred on laser land levelingwas recovered in one wheat season only. This study estimates positivebeneﬁt/cost ratios and net return of different PA treatments comparedto conventional farming.Actually, it is not imperative to level the ﬁelds every year thereby adding to the cost of production.Ashraf et al. (2017)study shows that there is no need to level theﬁelds at least upto 3 years.Aryal et al. (2015)supposed that a one-time application of laser land levelinglasts at least 4 years. This study use the remote sense image foundthat the laser land leveling lasts at least 3 years, and than the bene ﬁt/ cost ratio of PSLL will increase about 5% percent.The agricultural policies play a role in farmer's decision ( Touza et al., 2008;Barnes et al., 2016), developing policies by the governments thatencourage social services such as subsidies for PA technologies can helpfurther promote the popularization and application of PA technologiesin China.5. Conclusions(1) Compared with the local conventional large-scale farming, bothprecision seeding and integration of precision seeding and laserleveling increased the yield of winter wheat, with the latterbeing signiﬁcantly and more effective. They could also reducespatial variability of yield at the same time. With respect tocrop quality, the PA methods had no deleterious impact on thegrain protein content of the in-season wheat crops.(2) Precision seeding and integration of precision seeding and laserleveling reduced the soil nitrate and ammonium nitrogen con-centration at 0-60 cm layer after the wheat harvest comparedwith conventional farming to reduce ammonia volatilizationand nitrate nitrogen leaching loss risk.(3) In terms of economic beneﬁts, precision seeding increased thebeneﬁt/cost ratio by 7.3%, while integration of precision seedingand laser leveling increased the beneﬁt/cost ratio by 16.7% with laser land leveling subsidies in place or 8.1% without the subsi-dies. Net return under precision seeding increased by 15.5%(202.4 US$ ha−1). The increase under precision seeding andlaser land leveling was over 30% (430.4 US$ ha
−1)w i t h o u t laser land leveling subsidies or over 40% (546.4 US$ ha
−1)w i t h subsidies. As a one-time application of laser land leveling lasts for3 years, after spilt the cost of laser land leveling between 3 years,The beniﬁt increase under PSLL was raised 554.2 US$ ha
−1without subsidies or 592.8 US$ ha
−1with subsidies compared to C, bothover 40%.With respect to future research, further studies to evaluate the effec-tiveness and efﬁciency of different integrated precision agriculture tech-nologies should be undertaken. These should include variablefertilization, variable spraying, variable irrigation and other measures,as well as methods of awareness raising of the higher economic and en-vironmental beneﬁts for dryland farming in the central plains of China.Declaration of Competing InterestWe declare that we have noﬁnancial and personal relationshipswith other people or organizations that can inappropriately in ﬂuence our work, there is no professional or other personal interest of any na-ture or kind in any product, service and/or company that could be con-strued as inﬂuencing the position presented in the manuscript entitled.AcknowledgementsThis study is funded by the National Key Research and DevelopmentProgram of China (2017YFE0122500).
