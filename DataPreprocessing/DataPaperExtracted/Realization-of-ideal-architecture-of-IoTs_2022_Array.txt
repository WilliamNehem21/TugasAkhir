Cloud computing ABSTRACT  
As people are accustomed to the popularization of information services, immersive experiences are emphasized, 
which drives the vigorous development of virtual reality. In practice, devices are limited by their computing 
capabilities and rely on cloud computing to complete the overall service provided. As a result, technologies of the 
Internet of Things (IoT) emerge to respond to this demand. As an ideal IoT, in addition to lightweight, it is ideally 
to possess the following features: easy installation of devices, intelligent networking capability, multi-field 
equipment sharing, and customizable to meet various needs. However, most of the current IoTs are “Internet 
of Targets ” rather than “Internet of Things ”. The Internet of Targets is lacking interoperability because of 
incompatible communication protocols and interface features among a variety of “devices ” leading to different 
barriers thus hindering its applicability. This research task proposes two new ideas-refactor and feedback. The 
former meant that the system is able to change transmission path intelligently. The later enables the system 
reacts and acts appropriately in real time when receiving a stimulation. On the basis of the two factors we 
construct a conscious system served as the core of the “ideal IoT”. For the practical operating framework, we 
build a service model that integrates different data formations with feedback. We demonstrate the presented 
design by realizing a compact IoT system for long-term health care.   
1.Introduction 
Internet of Things (IoT) reveals the concept that connects all digital 
and electronic devices into the information world which is proposed for 
enhancing the quality of human lives and exploring innovative appli -
cations beyond traditional thoughts. The goal of IoT is that various de-
vices can cooperate smoothly and continuously to replenish each object 
with correct identification and appropriate timing. 
IoT has been used in a wide range of applications, such as smart cities 
[1,2], security, industrial manufacturing, agriculture [3], and even 
forestry [4] since the idea was unveiled in 2008 in which health care 
represents one of the most acceptable applications because of its po-
tential to give rise to several medical applications such as remote health 
monitoring, chronic diseases, elderly care, and more [5–10]. IoT also 
inspires many innovative business models. The research of [11] dis-
cusses how IoT devices organize consumers ’ behavior to create better 
marketing strategies in social media. 
The cutting-edge of IoTs can be roughly divided into wearable de-
vices, portable instruments [12], security [13,14], communication 
protocol comparison and optimization [15–17], and edge computing architecture [18–20] in terms of technical development. 
Due to advances in technology and economy of scale, the hardware 
cost is significantly decreasing with years. As a result, advanced sensors 
are being integrated into various kinds of systems. However, even 
though a variety of sensors are being adopted to certain areas, the range 
of IoT applications is still limited. This is because the concept of IoT 
nowadays is restricted to the traditional Internet OSI 7-layer model 
(ISO/IEC 7498-1) structure. Although there are research tasks trying to 
improve the architecture such as five-layer architecture, which addi-
tionally includes the processing and business layers [21], the entire 
system is still designed as a columnar structure. Thus, it is impossible to 
outline the blueprint of the interaction between human and things. In 
addition, the current network topology from measurement equipment to 
service systems is mostly vertically integrated, it is still hard to expand 
its functions to all kinds of application scenarios. 
There have been many papers discussing IoT since 2000. The 
research directions and fields are quite diverse. The authors of [2] have 
collected some relevant smart city methods and compared them to yield 
a general reference framework for the design of an urban IoT. This paper 
has observed uncertainty and the problems caused by such a framework

2in the face of massive integrated networks. 
The authors of [22] propose IoT requirements that fall into three 
categories and several items. The transmission category has latency, 
bandwidth, energy, and overhead; the storage category has storage 
balance and recovery; the computation category has computation 
loading, priority, and pricing. The work, different from Zanella ’s 
approach, uses centralized computing to focus on edge computing so as 
to meet the needs of a massive integrated network. In Ref. [3], the au-
thors use principal components analysis (PCA) to conduct data 
compression and anomaly detection, and divide the concept of edge 
computing into detailed steps, endpoint device computing, and fog 
computing. The attempt purposes to optimize the PCA model by calcu -
lating data from the endpoint devices on the server, and updating pa-
rameters of the PCA to the fog computing device in real-time. This 
allows IoT to correct uncertainties and errors in Ref. [2] when facing 
diversified environments. 
As time evolves, the features of IoTs have to be refined. The new 
network architecture is no longer based on the traditional internet 
models to discuss the distribution of computation or scale-up only but to 
deal with the complete system by considering total services and appli -
cations. The research task [23] proposes the concept of self-adaptive 
frameworks and the platform-as-a-service model. It emphasizes the 
importance of application-independent decentralized services and 
various IoT applications by the same devices. 
As described, the specific characteristics of the IoT system exist in 
cross-domain applications or services. Therefore, the development of 
machine intelligence is imperative. However, most of the previous 
studies show high dependence on data amount making their de-
velopments limited by the speed of data collection. In Ref. [24] the 
authors put forward another machine intelligence, named “human- -
centered cognitive computing ”. That is, humans become aware of 
ambient environments through their own perceptive sense organs as 
inputs. The input signals are transmitted to the brain through nerves for 
memory, analysis, and learning. The human also perceives responses to 
various body parts through the nervous system to react appropriately. 
The task of [25] proposes a paragraph of edge/cloud computing trans -
parency and the IoT computing topology to share data and multi-device 
management for different service units. However, the design makes the 
IoT architecture a bit heavy resulting in higher cost while deploying 
these application units. In Ref. [26], the authors propose identi -
fier/locator split and identity to identifier split schemes to accomplish 
the above requirements. 
To resolve the critical issues mentioned above, this paper proposes 
and builds a prototype lightweight IoT system. We define two major 
features to characterize an ideal IoT, i.e. “refactor ” and “feedback ”, 
which serve as the core parts of the proposed scheme. Refactoring is 
simply to change the transmission path intelligently with three ways:  
1. Self-protection route transmission: 
The proposed cell network system has a self-built network function. 
If the transmission path is damaged or busy during data transmission, 
the system will automatically select the next-shortest cell for data transmission.  
2. Automatic cell replacement: 
When the transmission cells are damaged, the cells can be replaced 
manually or by the stock box, and the cells will be automatically con-
nected to the transmission path without resetting.  
3. Variability transmission paths: 
When a user wears an identity device, the device can act as a 
transmission cell, allowing the overall cellular network to change its 
transmission structure. 
The Feedback has two modes: Response and Reflex. Response is like 
that one endows the overall IoT system with a thinking capability. When 
data is transmitted to the server, the respective computing resource re-
sponds accordingly. Reflex, on the other hand, is analogous to the 
human nervous system, it reacts and acts in real time when receiving a 
stimulation. 
On the basis of the two features, a more ideal IoT structure, named 
the “conscious system ”, is proposed which consists of four major 
quadrants-Memory, Recognition, Reaction, Adaptation. The quadrant ’s 
responsibilities and how they interact with each other will be explained 
in the main text. Moreover, an epoch-making network topology, named 
“stem cellular network ”, that mimics the function of creatures ’ stem 
cells forming a set of interstitial transmission systems for connection and 
communication between real world and digital IoT world is also pro-
posed. The prototype is realized and verified in an elder health care 
center for demonstration. 
2.Description of ideas 
An ecosystem is a community of living things in conjunction with 
nonliving components of the environment, which interact with each 
other and the environment constitutes a complete system. The current 
IoT systems are mostly isolated and unable to open and easily connect to 
the environment or other systems. This fact makes it impossible for the 
current IoT to become an ecosystem. We propose here the idea of “bio- 
design ” and presents a bionic IoT architecture to fulfill the characteris -
tics of an ideal IoT. It’s not our aim to build up the entire ecosystem, but 
to discuss a single individual first, emphasize the interaction and cycle 
between a living body and environment. 
The general human life is composed of three parts: sensor and motor, 
message transmission network, and cognitive learning capability. Our 
proposed IoT architecture mimics the latter two where a stem cellular 
network (SCN) describes the message transmission component and a 
conscious system (CS) describes the cognitive component. 
2.1. Stem cellular network 
Stem cells are undifferentiated or partially differentiated cells that 
can be variated into various types of cells; this property is called “Po-
tency ”. Self-renewal is another important property, it is the ability to go 
through numerous cycles of cell growth and cell division while main -
taining the undifferentiated state. 
As for the transmission system, the IoT, which can be widely used, 
might no longer be entered from the perspective of information theory. 
Rather, it is appropriate to discuss from the perspective of biological 
cells. The major difference is that traditional network structures are to 
preset a goal to achieve and divide the goal into different specific pro-
cesses and finally to complete the detailed implementation. 
Our approach doesn ’t intend to build a creature as sophisticated as 
mammals, but learn and extend from the organism ’s features to realize 
our idea. We take the advantage of two features of stem cells, i.e., po-
tency and self-renewal. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the potency property of a 
stem cell is differentiated into various tissue cells while the basic cell 
Fig. 1.Diagram of differentiation ability.  C.-Y. Chen et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Array 14 (2022) 100148
3module is differentiated into various functional cells. Since electronic 
devices cannot duplicate by themselves, we thus introduce the feature of 
self-renewal. It is expected that all devices can be replaced fluently 
without the need for complicated parameter settings as those in the 
traditional IoTs. Based on the feature analogy, we name the transmission 
system as the stem cellular network (SCN). 
To simplify presentation, only the definitions of a few minimum units 
(i.e. cells) are regulated, and the specific realization of the IoT is 
completed by the exchange of each unit itself. Fundamental definitions 
of cells are listed below:  
≡Every cell is evolved from the stem cells which meant that all cells 
possess common characteristics.  
≡Unique identification of each cell makes all cells distinguishable.  
≡Cells can communicate with each other.  
≡Cells can adapt to environments and alternate action patterns or 
modes. 
2.2. Conscious system 
The IoT collects real-time information of the objects ’ concerns in the 
real world. The major problem is “How could one handle these hetero -
geneous signals meaningfully? ” 
ORID is a group discussion method (also known as the focused 
conversation method) [27] that moves the objective information, 
through their initial responses and interpretations, to develop solid 
conclusions. Fig. 2 explains the process of how human cognize actual 
data and deal with their responses to undertake analysis and make 
decision. 
We propose a system architecture inspired by the ORID. The idea 
consists of four quadrants: Memory, Recognition, Reaction, Adaptation 
into a complete platform. Unlike the previous studies, we use “Quad -
rant” to define its basic elements instead of blocks or layers. The four 
elements are closely associated with others, rather than independently 
executing plan and construction. 
As shown in Fig. 3, the CS is composed of four quadrants. First, the 
“Memory ” quadrant is responsible for handling data access optimization and compression. Regarding the interaction with other quadrants, three 
memory zones are needed: RunTime Management In-formation, Meta- 
White Data, and Smart Tangram Pattern. RunTime Management In- 
formation records the operating status of each part of the system, 
which includes authorization, environment, and connection quality. 
Meta-White Data records the effective features obtained by all end ob-
jects, which include time, value, upstream route, surrounding object 
parameters, etc. Smart Tangram Pattern records data structure, which 
include original data samples, their representative meaning, and inter-
pretation; it also includes the system operating rules and the changing 
history. The importance of this part is to make data to be arranged 
reasonably. It can restore digital data to reality and define the procedure 
for incorporating new objects. 
Secondly, the “Recognition ” quadrant is responsible to manage edge 
devices and explain the information returned from the end-sensing 
components. Since most of the sensors placed around people ’s lives 
are getting sophisticated, the unneglectable problem is not the lack of 
data but the clear relationship between the physical environment and 
data. For example, temperature measurement within an oven or in the 
living room may use a similar sensor but with a totally different control 
strategy. The goal of this quadrant is to distinguish the usage or scenario 
of sensors by interpreting the received information across time, space, 
and type. Also, because the way of interpretation can be changed ac-
cording to the content of the Memory quadrant, it is thus called 
Recognition. If the above narrative is difficult to understand when this 
function or program comes to the real world, this paper suggests some 
thinking directions that can be used as design guidelines: i) How to 
construct the state machine of edge devices. ii) Who can provide infor-
mation and its format. iii) To whom to respond, its response rules and 
information contained. 
Next, the “Reaction ” quadrant generates feedback signals to the 
related objects or the same end objects based on the recognized results. 
The overall system interacts with users through these signals. Among 
them, this quadrant can be subdivided into two aspects: Response and 
Reflex. The major difference between the two aspects is that Response 
needs to go through Recognize first, while Reflex doesn ’t. In general, 
Response needs to go through a more complicated calculation process

Fig. 3.Graphical illustration of the proposed conscious system.  C.-Y. Chen et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Array 14 (2022) 100148
4that can even be connected to other data analysis systems to acquire 
more reliable and stable signal feedback. Reflex undergoes a simplified 
process, for example, a threshold, interval, or signal existence, to ach-
ieve the least feedback delay. It is usually used in the situation of 
emergency or the highest priority feedback. 
Lastly, when a system is developed, it will naturally have one or more 
goals and meet different needs. However, the needs might change with 
time, and even needed to be adapted to local conditions. The system 
architecture of this research supposes that the following issues are 
considered at the early design stage: i) Create new rules in response to 
new needs. ii) Use different parameters according to different applica -
tions. iii) Eliminate expired or no longer applicable services. The re-
sponsibility of the “Adaptation ” quadrant is to determine the purpose 
and change the ‘Recognition and Reaction ’ rules based on the re-
quirements adapted to the current goals. The formulation of its rules can 
be based on the results of professional research and analysis in the 
application field or developed from the information in memory analyzed 
by machine learning. 
3.Case study and framework design 
An elder nursing home is an appropriate place for experimental 
verification. After conducting a field survey, this study plans a series of 
services and creates a simulated field. There are already mature hospital 
information systems (HIS). Therefore, this research task doesn ’t go into 
any details of the function that the HIS already has. 
Early prevention and control of diseases are the keys to maintaining a 
healthy body status. These could be done by measuring and recording 
the condition or state of the body or bodily functions regularly and 
periodically. Although physiological measurement products have been 
widely developed on the market, perennial data are still not efficiently 
generated or collected. The major reason is that current approaches for 
collecting measured data rely heavily on tedious human operations. 
Nowadays, the digitization of data for most instruments still stays in a 
semi-automatic stage. Even for some of the advanced instruments that 
can automatically upload data, most of the instruments don’t consider 
the situation of multiple users, leading to incompatible data formats. In 
addition, the database access specifications provided by various in-
strument brands are developed independently. Therefore, it is difficult 
to integrate instruments produced by different manufacturers in 
practice. 3.1. Case study 
This section proposes a simple and complete solution on a simulated 
field as the case study. In this scheme, all instruments can automatically 
uplink data with detailed information and ID code and integrated into a 
unified database. 
There are various dynamic and static measurements in practical 
health care applications. The former sets tracking requirements of the 
residents according to their medical conditions, and notify active 
nursing staff to assist with the measurement, such as an intensive 
glucose monitor needed by diabetics. The examples in common include 
blood pressure, blood sugar, uric acid, thermometer, body weight, etc. 
The static measurement meant that the instrument can continuously 
measure the residents after the initial framework is completed. In this 
research task, a physiological detection mattress is developed which can 
help nursing staff to monitor the bed-ridden status of the patient ’s 
sleeping time, position, heart rate, and breathing. Besides, long-term 
mattress data are collected and used to analyze patient ’s sleeping sta-
tus and issue warning signals when an abnormal heartbeat or breathing 
is detected. 
The second part is the identification method. A heart rate measuring 
bracelet is utilized for this purpose. The bracelet automatically sub-
stitutes the ID code into the instrument. However, with the diversifica -
tion of requirements, the newly developed devices can be incorporated 
into the system through the established format and procedure, for 
example, the face recognition technique. The bracelet confirms the pa-
tient ’s status via regular heart rate detection. When the system receives 
information of the user’s status, it proceeds to execute access control or 
area management. Since the bracelet is equipped with a human face 
feature for recognition, multi-factor authentication applications can be 
realized. 
3.2. Structure design of SCN 
As SCN is the transmission channel of the IoT, it exhibits features of 
low power consumption, small size, and discrete data. Through stan-
dardized interfaces, it can be combined with various instruments. Ac-
cording to the instrument type and purpose, cells here are divided into 
active, status, transmission, and hub. Among them, the active cell refers 
to objects that are deliberately used or can be actuated in response to 
instructions. The status cell refers to an object that represents the status 
of an individual rather than a deliberately used one, which is built into 
the individual identification bracelet in this research. The transmission 
cell transmits data packets to communicate between the active and hub 
cells. The hub cell is the interface with CS. Details of which are explained 
in the follows. 
Four types of cell complete three features of the SCN:  
1) Auto-state sensing before transmission 
The active cell automatically senses information of the neighboring 
state cells, receives the value of its matching instrument, and packs it 
into a data packet before transmission. Since this research task puts force 
on health care, the state cell design includes residents and nursing 
members only. Therefore, each active cell is specified to receive at most 
two-state cells when activated.  
2) Continually repeat connecting transmission 
The purpose of SCN is to provide a wide-area and lightweight 
transmission network. Therefore, the hub cell being densely arranged 
like a Wi-Fi router is not expected. When a transmission cell cannot 
directly deliver data packets to the hub cell, it needs to be directed to 
connect through other transmission cells. However, this results in 
another problem, i.e. excessively complex routing rules will increase 
difficulty of computing the transmission cell, which violates the 
Fig. 4.Structure of the CS.  C.-Y. Chen et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Array 14 (2022) 100148
5principle of lightweight. Under the premise of not using complex routing 
rules, to avoid data packets from echoing in the network, a polarity 
setting is included in the transmission cell. The transmitting cell com-
pares the polarity of the data packet with itself to determine the trans -
mission direction.  
3) Self-adaptive network environment 
Following the feature mentioned, the transmission cell detects the 
hub cell and other transmission nodes within the signal range and sets its 
own polarity according to the environment. After the transmitting cell 
completes the initialization and polarity setting, it will be able to receive 
data packets from the state and the active nodes. When the active cell is 
activated, i.e. the instrument has completed measurement, it detects the 
status node information, and sends data packets to the hub cell through 
the transmitting cell. 
3.3. Structure design of CS 
The architecture of CS is illustrated in Fig. 4 with each unit corre -
sponding to a quadrant. The biggest feature of the IoT is that it connects 
reality and virtuality via various sensing and actuating mechanisms. To 
process the object signals transmitted through the SCN, the first step of 
CS is to set up the connection interface, called the interpret unit. The 
interpret unit initially processes data packets transmitted from SCN to 
facilitate subsequent Ethernet connection. It fulfills the preliminary data 
processing to facilitate the subsequent passages on the ethernet. When 
data packets come from SCN, the interpret unit checks and verifies 
checksum to ensure correctness of the transmitted data. As data packets 
need to go through Ethernet, the interpret unit is also responsible for encryption and decryption to ensure transmission security of the public 
network. 
The role of the comprehension unit is to expand data to a high-level 
format. It includes data decompression, decryption, and format con-
version. That is to convert data into information. The signal of the object 
is re-directed to the physical meaning through the virtual data. For 
example, it converts the biological resistance value to the body fat scale. 
An important feature of the IoT is to interact with users through real- 
time feedback. There are two parts, reflex unit and response unit, which 
are designed to generate feedback signals. Both of which refer to the 
definition of a Recipe block to determine the object and content of the 
feedback. The Recipe block stores parameters of the reflex and response 
units. The reflex unit feedback to the measuring instrument depends 
solely on the input signal that makes users get reactions instantly. The 
response unit refers to the information in the database to generate 
feedback signals making users receive fully-analyzed reactions. 
Because IoTs are constantly changing with real-world applications, it 
is impossible to deal with such a changing situation with fixed parameter 
settings. Only an adaptable unit can integrate all feedback from the 
response unit with information in the storage block to change parame -
ters in the recipe block. 
For the “Memory ” quadrant, there are two blocks, storage block, and 
recipe block. There are four storage types in the storage block, i.e., 
simple, combine, complex, and real-time. The simple type stores sin-
gular data such as weight or temperature. Data of the combined type are 
mutually supportive such as blood pressure, systolic blood pressure, and 
diastolic blood pressure. Those are related data and cannot be utilized 
separately. For example, the feature vector obtained by face recognition 
should only be interpreted by other models. Only the key information 
being stored is classified as the complex type. Real-time type is for time- 
sensitive data, i.e. the data will be expired in a limited period. 
4.Implementation and demonstration 
As shown in Fig. 5, we first define the cell name for the explanation in 
the following section. Fig. 6 shows the connection of the cells and 
devices. 
4.1. Implementation of stem cell network 
Nordic nRF24L01 is used as the main physical carrier to realize IoT 
signal transmission. As illustrated in Fig. 5, the structure of cells involves 
active cells, state cells, transmission cells, and hub cells. Tx and Rx, are 
the data transmission tunnels based on the uART protocol, see Fig. 6. 
The operational flow chart is shown in Fig. 7 which describes the 
operational process of active and state cells. Both active and state cells 
regularly check whether they have been specialized. If not, the cells keep 
waiting for the external signal to issue specialized information through 
Rx and store it in the electrically-erasable programmable read-only 
memory (EEROM) of the cell. At the same time, through the 
mentioned specialization process, each cell is assigned a unique ID code. 
Since it has been written in the EEROM, the ID code cannot be altered 
after being written in. 
In SCN we define three types of identification. PID, SID, and DID 
referred, respectively, to the primary state cell ID code, the secondary 
state cell ID code, and the active cell ID code which performs 
measurement. 
The state cell first configs its working mode, i.e. resident or nursing 
mode. Since both hub and transmission cells form a communication 
field, the state cell constantly confirms whether it is still within the field. 
When within the field, the status information is broadcasted to the 
communication field. At the same time, it monitors whether there is an 
active cell asking for its own information. 
Both transmission and hub cells deal with data packet transmission 
and decide direction by the polarity of data packet. The difference be-
tween the twos is that the transmission cell transmits signal wirelessly,

Chen et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Array 14 (2022) 100148
6while the hub cell converts wireless signals to wired signals and connects 
to the CS. 
The application scenarios and interaction of various cells are 
described in the follows ：  
● The state cell contains the basic information of each person including 
the identity. When the state cell enters within the communication 
field created by the hub and transmission cells, it will automatically 
match the object with the field to set the appropriate working mode 
as the resident mode or the nursing. mode. Here, we define the 
resident mode as institutional residents and the nursing mode as 
caregivers.  ● When the device with the built-in active cell is used by the caregiver, 
it will obtain the closest resident mode state cell and nursing mode 
state cell information. We presume that the residents of the organi -
zation are the main measurement objects, the information of the 
resident mode state cell will be placed in the PID, and the nursing 
mode state cell will be placed in the SID. After necessary information 
are integrated, a data packet is sent out wirelessly so that the 
transmission cell or the hub cell can deliver it to the CS thereby 
completing one measurement collection.  
● By this way, caregivers can use various devices and tools more 
flexible at any time, avoiding distraction from unnecessary settings 
and records.  
● We allow the SID area in the data packet to be blank and provide self- 
use devices for residents to perform self-care. This would bring more 
flexibility in the management and operation of the entire 
organization. 
4.2. Data packet in stem cell network 
As shown in Fig. 8, a complete data packet covers data feature, ack 
command, path token, timestamp, ID code and packet polarity. The data 
length is marked in the figure in byte strings. Format of the upper row is 
for carrying measurement data of the instrument while format of the 
lower row is assigned for instrument settings. We specify the target

7instrument for transmission by path token and ID code. 
The data feature is the digital signal that the instrument needs to 
transmit through SCN. The path token records ID codes of the first and 
last transmission cells on the transmission path. 
The ID code takes three parts, PID, SID and DID. Packet polarity is 
used to package and indicate the direction of transmission in SCN. 
4.3. Implementation of conscious system 
To explain the different processing modes from SCN and avoid 
confusion, we introduce a new type of data packet of CS named the issue 
packet. It is divided into three categories: instrument issue, adjunction 
issue, and request issue. Instrument issue refers to signals transmitted 
from the instrument through SCN. Adjunction refers to the issue packet 
derived after data processing of the comprehension unit. Request refers to the data processing requirements from the external request, such as 
reading historical data for other HIS from the database. 
We proceed to describe details of the implementation of CS with the 
structure illustrated in Fig. 9. The embedded system is an adapter con-
necting CS and SCN. We integrate the interpret and reflex units in the 
embedded system and leave the response and comprehension units in 
the server. Such a plan cannot only reduce server loading since the usage 
of distributed computing but allows the system to partially working 
when it is offline. 
The byte string containing data packets transmitted to SCN is con-
verted to the issue packet in the interpret unit for CS usage; the issue 
packet will be sent to the reflex and response units to generate signals 
feedback to SCN to complete the reaction process. The format of the 
issue packet adopts the JSON design which is easy to process by 
computer.

Chen et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Array 14 (2022) 100148
8The format is described as follows. A web server, Nginx, is used to 
assist the server in establishing the connection to the embedded system 
in the ethernet. It also handles the request for load balancing. The in-
formation of connection between the embedded system and the server is 
stored and managed in the routing managing unit. 
The heap processor unit is responsible for allocating the issue packet 
processing schedule. The double-headed arrow in the figure represents 
data circulation. Each measured signal is firstly calculated by the 
comprehension unit or sent to the external-processing module, which 
then enters to the response unit for generating feedback or conducting 
data storage. The structure of comprehension unit is relatively complicated, and 
hot-swappable plug-ins is used to realize the dynamic service update of 
the system and maintain scalability and maintainability of the system. 
The internal structure consists of a distributor and several policies as 
illustrated in Fig. 10. Policies are replaceable sub-programs, they can be 
changed or modified without rebooting the whole SC system. It handles 
all the issue packets reaching the CS, including signal format translation, 
data comparison or processing according to the requirements. The 
distributor is responsible for allocating the issue packet to the required 
policy and managing its multi-tasking process. 
Five policies are established to respond the needs:  
≡Data Re-Transform: The function for reconverting the measured 
information. For example, the general household body fat meter is 
measured by the bioelectrical impedance analysis method, which 
needs to be matched with other physiological data for accuracy 
alignment. Therefore, the instrument itself only outputs the 
measured value of its human body impedance, and the correct data 
should be obtained after conducting necessary conversion.  
≡Face Recognition: The face authentication and anti-spoofing system 
developed in Ref. [28] performs feature calculation and matches to 
the server to perform a secondary verification. By this way, the 
timeliness and high safety of this function are ensured.  
≡Identity Unification: This is used to align identities. In practical 
applications, a user may have multiple IDs. This policy enables 
measurement data to be mapped to the correct personal profile based 
on these IDs.  
≡Check Missing Item: This is used to check missing items of the 
measurement. In practical applications, there will be a standardized Table 1

issues a reminder when it is overdue.  
≡Connect Signal: Sometimes one needs to check the physiological 
condition by examining the trend of the value, not just a single 
measurement, such as heartbeat, breathing, etc. This policy is 
designed to connect the fragmented signals for trend analysis.

11surely, there are still issues worthy of further investigation. For example, 
the efficiency and stability when facing the high concurrency situation. 
However, the lightweight modular architecture designed for this work 
makes it easy to maintain and modify, in addition, it brings up a sig-
nificant potential for performance or functional evolution. 
4.4. Issue data packet in conscious system 
Here, letters are used as prefixes to represent different data meanings 
and digital codes are used for both comprehension and heap processing 
units. Table 1 shows the protocol of the data packet considered. 
4.5. Demonstration 
This section shows the integrated instrument and its data flow 
including data packet transmitted in SCN, how issue packet is process -
ing, and the final output. Fig. 11 displays data format of the Smart 
Tangram Pattern database. The behaviour of both interpret and reflex 
units in CS takes the info in this database as the reference. 
The data comes from SCN being interpreted according to the Smart 
Tangram Pattern (STP) database. Firstly, the data is identified by 
checking its length, header, and anchor abbreviated “Header”, “Length”, 
“Anchor0_pos”, and “Anchor0_value” columns in the STP database. 
Next, the data are interpreted, based on the “Mask” column. Finally, the 
CS creates reflex signals from the “Reflex_Formula” column. In Fig. 12, 
we have provided an example to interpret data when transmitting it 
from SCN to CS. 
Fig. 13 interprets data flow from three devices. The red box in Fig. 13 
(a) and (b) marks the active cell attached to the instruments. There are 
thermometers, weight scale, sphygmomanometer, and blood sugar/uric 
acid meter as dynamic measurements. We have built a smart mattress as 
an example for static measurement, see Fig. 13(c). This smart mattress 
can detect the user’s heartbeat, breathing rate and possesses the emer -
gency call function. The detection mechanism will be automatically 
activated and taken measurement every 15 s and regularly sent to the 
SCN when a user lies on it. 
Next, we show the capability of communication between two de-
vices. In Fig. 14, there are two transmission cells establishing two 
transmission fields in zones 1 and 2. When the nurse uses a thermometer 
to measure the patient’s body temperature in zone 1, the system rec-
ognizes that the measured value is for the patient. When the nurse 
conducts a body temperature self-check-in zone 2, the system marks the result in the nurse’s profile. The system automatically completes the 
procedure waving extra user operations. 
Fig. 15(a) demonstrates the practical usage scenarios and HIS 
interface. It shows that after the user measures blood pressure, body 
temperature, and weight, the interface automatically updates the latest 
measured value; the two-week data collection shows the trend of 
physical statuses. To secure user privacy, the interface displays the 
physiological information only after confirming the user’s ID. Fig. 15(b) 
demonstrates that users can track their breathing and heartbeat records 
via a pneumatic mattress. The comprehension unit in the CS connects 
discretized signals from the pneumatic mattress to monitor various 
physiological signals. The data could be, for example, used for the study 
of polysomnography or insomnia. 
4.6. Overview of implementation 
This section describes the way of realization for a fundamental stem 
cell module with an RF chip and constructs the entire SCN. In addition to 
building a wireless channel of information, physiologically measuring 
devices and wearable devices are integrated into the SCN. The CS is next 
implemented to coordinate all devices in the SCN and display the 
analysis result. The complete steps of IoT services applying to a long- 
term health care scenario are illustrated in Fig. 16 that illustrates the 
proposed IoT configuration. This real-world implementation presents 
the capability of mobility, scalability, fast response, low power con-
sumption, low implementation cost and providing the function of object 
positioning. It exhibits two major features, feedback and refactors, as 
mentioned previously. 
The concept of SCN cellularizes all IoT components, each cell has its 
own task and can be matched at will. The CS architecture design uses a 
simplified structure to accept information from various internet- 
connected devices. After processing, the information can be fed back 
to a suitable object for operation. Fig. 17 illustrates the whole archi -
tecture of an ideal IoTs. On the mobile link, we have realized a multi- 
dimensional mesh link, that can respond to the change of the trans -
mission structure of the user (PID). Through the adaptation of CS, in-
formation received from different application fields can be integrated to 
provide appropriate data to observers and for artificial intelligence (AI) 
applications. 
Table 2 compares operational differences among benchmarked ap-
proaches of the IoT applications. Advantages of the proposed one can be 
perceived from the aspects of easy implementation, scalability, and Table 2

5.Conclusions 
This paper presents the idea for implementation of an idealized IoT. 
The IoT structures seen on the market are mostly target-oriented such as 
for smart city, intelligent agriculture, or manufacturing, etc. Those IoTs 
meant “Internet of Targets ” rather than “Internet of Things ”. The former 
is lacking of interoperability leading to a barrier hindering its applica -
bility. The ideal IoT introduced here aims to challenge the problem by 
providing an alternative solution. Through emulating organisms and 
human behavior, this research task has implemented the core parts, i.e. 
SCN and CS, in a health-care center and demonstrated their functions. 
The presented work accomplishes a prototype in terms of a simplified 
framework. Still, there are remnants to be tackled: (i) with the 
increasing application fields to be implemented, calibration and testing 
have to be gradually accomplished and data have to be accumulated; (ii) 
implementing the vigorous function of the self-integrated “adaptation ” 
quadrant; (iii) integrating and developing diverse peripheral equipment 
to expand the cross-domain applications.
