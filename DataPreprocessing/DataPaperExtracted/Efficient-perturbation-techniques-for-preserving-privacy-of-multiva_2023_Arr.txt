Cloud data is increasing significantly recently because of the advancement of technology which can contain
individuals’ sensitive information, such as medical diagnostics reports. While deriving knowledge from such
sensitive data, different third party can get their hands on this sensitive information. Therefore, privacy
preservation of such sensitive data has become a vital issue. Data perturbation is one of the most often used
data mining approaches for safeguarding privacy. A significant challenge in data perturbation is balancing the
privacy and utility of data. Securing an individual’s privacy often entails the forfeiture of the data utility, and
the contrary is true. Though there exist several approaches to deal with the trade-off between privacy and
utility, researchers are always looking for new approaches. In order to address this critical issue, this paper
proposes two data perturbation approaches namely NOS2R and NOS2R2. The proposed perturbation techniques
are experimented with over ten benchmark UCI data set for analyzing privacy protection, information entropy,
attack resistance, data utility, and classification error. The proposed approaches are compared with two existing
approaches 3DRT and NRoReM. The thorough experimental analysis exhibits that the best-performing approach
NOS2R2 offers 15.48% higher entropy and 15.53% more resistance against ICA attack compared to the best
existing approach NRoReM. Furthermore, in terms of utility, the accuracy, f1-score, precision and recall of
NOS2R2 perturbed data are 42.32%, 31.22%, 30.77% and 16.15% more close to the original data respectively
than the NRoReM perturbed data.
1. Introduction
Because of the rapid growth of cloud technology and its storage
ability, a big volume of data is being used constantly in this era of in-
formation technology. A substantial amount of data is transmitted and
received on a daily basis via communication channels due to the rapid
advancement of data gathering methods [ 1]. These data may contain
many valuable and sensitive information such as commerce [ 1], edu-
cation [ 2], banking [ 3], healthcare [ 3,4], lifestyle, habits and personal
preferences [ 4]. People are often reluctant to give personally identi-
fiable information. Such reluctance to provide personal information
constrains the accessibility of vital data for knowledge discovery [ 5,6].
Data mining is the key technique of expertly identifying previously
unknown patterns and information from data [ 7]. Many data mining
techniques have made it possible to extract information from massive
amounts of data [ 8]. Many companies and organizations utilize this
data to make decisions in order to increase customer contentment [ 8].
The knowledge that is retrieved is crucial for modeling subsequent
business operations. As a result, it is envisaged that during data mining
operations, individual privacy should be protected and the data set’s

data. Other big data repositories, such as crimes [ 9], epidemics [ 10],
medical reports, customer information, and social physics [ 11] need the
data to study human behavior and forecast events that are primarily
centered on people. Therefore, protecting individuals’ privacy while
conducting analysis chores has become a crucial issue that necessitates
forceful answers.
Let us think about the illustration in the Table 1 to highlight the
privacy and utility scenario. It contains the customer ID, account num-
ber, amount of transaction and current balance of three customers of an
organization. The customer ID, account number, amount of transaction
and current balance of customers are highly sensitive and private.
The organizations typically do not divulge any details about their
clients. However, sometimes it may be important to evaluate this data
to gain insight into the organization’s and the customers’ condition.
The companies must study the customer information provided with
a specific level of modification to achieve these goals of utility and
privacy. Let us accomplish it by rotating in two dimensions at random
angles𝜃1= 1.9◦and𝜃2= 3.3◦respectively. Since the 2-dimensional

rotation matrix has a dimension of 2 ×2, we analyzed two attributes
at a time to fulfill matrix multiplication rule. So the first attribute pair
is formed by customer ID and account number, whereas the second
attribute pair is formed by amount of transaction and current balance.
The 2-Dimensional rotation matrix by counterclockwise direction [12]
is denoted by:
𝑅𝜃=(𝑐𝑜𝑠𝜃 −𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃
𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃 𝑐𝑜𝑠𝜃)
The Table 2 represents the result after rotation. Then we use two
larger random angles 𝜃1= 47.8◦and𝜃2= 55.2◦which result is depicted
in Table 3. Analyzing Tables 2 and 3, it is realized that the modified
data in Table 2 is sufficiently similar to the original data. As a result,
data mining algorithms find it quite simple to bring out information
that closely resembles the actual data. However, it is difficult to hide
the original data because the perturbed data is almost similar to the
original one. On the other hand, it is observed that the revised data
are very different from the original data in Table 3. Furthermore,
some of them are negative. As a result, data mining algorithms have
a great difficulty retrieving information unlike to the original data.
However, in this scenario, approximating the information is difficult,
which guarantees some privacy. As can be seen from Tables 2 and 3,
one transformation fails to protect privacy but preserves the utility,
while the other fails to keep up its utility but is able to safeguard
privacy. A significant challenge in data mining is the trade-off between
privacy and utility.
Privacy-preserving data mining (PPDM) is one of the well-known
trends in privacy field. It is motivated by one of the information era’s
most important policy issues: the right to privacy. PPDM has been
formed as a subject of study in which data mining techniques can be uti-
lized to examine private confidential information about persons while
protecting their privacy [5]. It is all about improving ‘‘traditional’’ data
mining and making it more privacy conscious by employing unique
privacy-preserving approaches that will create accurate data mining
predictions, show fascinating data patterns, while also safeguarding
privacy and data utility [13]. It has been extensively researched in the
context of big data. In PPDM, the information that can be extracted
from a modified data set by current data mining methods is virtually
identical to what can be extracted from the actual data set [5,13].
The main objective of PPDM techniques is to ensure individual pri-
vacy while still considering data utility [1,5,6]. PPDM has two major
concerns [5,14]. Firstly, the original data can only be accessed by the
owner or authorized users [1] and only they can alter confidential raw
data in a way that differs from the original database. Thus the privacy
is protected. Second, such information ought to be eliminated from thedata set altogether. So, the primary goal of data mining strategies based
on PPDM is to develop methodologies that may change the original data
while maintaining the privacy of the underlying information during the
data mining process [5].
Privacy and data utility are two opposing factors in data mining.
It is almost difficult and a huge challenge for any algorithm to be
better than all other algorithms in terms of privacy, utility, complexity
and so on [15]. Different research initiatives in the subject of PPDM
are being examined to deal with this burgeoning challenge. There are
different perturbation techniques, such as noise addition [16], conden-
sation based approach [17], random projection-based approach [18]
and many others. All these approaches have some limitations. The
noise addition based perturbation approach generates random noise
in the data set’s particular columns [5]. There is another perturbation
strategy which is based on randomization. Although this technique is
straightforward, attacks based on reconstruction are a threat for this
technique. On contrary, in another technique based on condensation,
there is a privacy concern because it is highly likely that the perturbed
data can be used to deduce the original data [19]. A few of the
original data points are projected into a different space than the origi-
nal multidimensional space in a random projection-based perturbation
strategy [18]. Projection perturbation can preserve graphical fidelity
because data set from different spaces can be merged more accurately
than those from euclidean space. [20]. Consequently, the protection
of sensitive details is mostly concentrated on various phases of a data
mining task in other existing systems [5]. Several studies have also
focused on the utility of data, such as in [5,21].
In this paper, two approaches namely NOS2R (Normalization, Scal-
ing, Shearing and Reflection) based perturbation and NOS2R2 (Normal-
ization, Scaling, Shearing, Reflection and Rotation) based perturbation
have been proposed which maintain data utility and preserve privacy
at the same time. Normalization is used to have a standard scale for
every data point in the data matrix [5]. In this work, z-score is used as
a normalization approach. Scaling is the technique of adjusting data.
The coordinate points of the original data change as a result of scaling.
It also changes the size of the data. Shearing deals with changing the
geometric property along axes. The shape of the object is modified via
shearing. In multi-dimensional space, rotation transformation preserves
geometric attributes such as length, inner product, shapes such as hyper
plane, and hyper curved surfaces. Data utility can be achieved by
improving data perturbation parameters for scaling, shearing, reflection
and rotation in a systematic way [3]. The privacy of the approach was
then assessed in terms of privacy guarantee, attack resistance and an
increase in entropy [3].
The remaining portion of this paper is organized as Section 2
summarizes the existing work which are related to this research work.
Section 3 represents the overview of perturbation techniques. The
metrics used for analyzing privacy and utility are discussed in Section 4.
In Section 5, the proposed approaches NOS2R and NOS2R2 are de-
scribed. Section 6 represents the experimental analysis and provides
a comparative analysis of the performance. In the last section, our
research work is concluded.
2. Related work
Individuals’ information has become pervasive in today’s world. In
case of big data, there are a lot of potential as well as a lot of risk
and on the other hand, a slew of security and privacy issues [22]. So,
the researchers’ mission of safeguarding privacy has been challenging.
Several methodologies have been applied by various studies conducted
over the last few years to discover solutions to this problem while
maintaining utility and preserving privacy.
In [23], Chamikara et al. offers a perturbation algorithm called
DISTPAB to preserve the privacy of horizontally partitioned data in a
distributed context. This strategy reduces computational limitations byArray 20 (2023) 100324
3M. Rahman et al.
dispersing the burden of privacy preservation across a dispersed ecosys-
tem with resource-constrained devices and high-performance comput-
ers, taking advantage of the asymmetry of resources. But this work has
a limitation i.e. it works only for horizontally partitioned data. So when
some vertically partitioned data appears, this method cannot maintain
the utility and privacy trade-off.
For sensitive data mining, a method called NRoReM is proposed
by Paul et al. in [5]. This data perturbation approach consists of
four stages. At first normalization, secondly geometric rotation, then
linear regression, and finally scalar multiplication was followed. The
exploratory study of privacy protection, attack resistance, information
entropy analysis, data utility, and error analysis reveals that NRoReM
protects individual privacy as well as data utility on a greater level.
However, when scalar multiplication is used for better privacy, the size
of the data set is altered, which sometimes results in a decrease in utility
in some cases.
A method for protecting privacy is represented in [24] which is
based on distance matrix. Its aim is to secure common comparable
data that is disseminated among many organizations. In circumstances
where the amount of data in each organization is limited and the data
bias is substantial, the suggested method robustly integrates scattered
data that is of the same quality as linked raw data. Furthermore, this
proposed method can be used with data that has been corrupted by
noise. Even after introducing noise, the statistics of the original data
could still be calculated which is a threat and it necessitates a more
robust method of privacy protection.
To alter and restore data, a method called RPCM is devised in [25]
that leverages reversible data concealment mechanisms. According to
the observations, when dealing with perturbed data, RPCM keeps al-
most similar knowledge as it does in original data and when the
degree of data disruption grows, the risk of privacy leakage does not
increase. In [26], a new data perturbation technique is proposed named
Range Noise Perturbation (RNP). Data set is perturbed four times in
this procedure. In the first step, it analyzes a group of attributes for
perturbation; in the second, it selects a range noise value; and in the
third step, it figures the range and determines the noise. The perturbed
attributes are then used to update the data set. However, there is still
a risk of privacy and utility trade-off because this method depends on
the range noise value.
The paper [27] introduces a Bayesian-based PPDM approach for
classification. This method is a data perturbation method which is
algorithm-independent, implying that the perturbed data can be used
directly by traditional classification methods. Experiments show that
this strategy is effective at securing privacy while maintaining data
utility. A semi-supervised privacy-preserving clustering approach is
proposed in [28]. The method of this study learns a large margin
nearest cluster metric using convex optimization utilizing a limited
quantity of supervised data. The method then applies multiplicative
perturbation on the original data based on the learned metric, which
might change the distribution shape of the original data and therefore
protect privacy information while assuring good data usability. Despite
that, the inner-site sharing of the LMNC (Large Margin Nearest Cluster)
metric within the distributed system, any site that acquires access to
the modified data of others is endowed with the capacity to retrieve
the corresponding original data.
Torra proposed a new approach microaggregation [29]. This method
involves using a clustering algorithm to protect the data set, and then
replacing each of the data with the cluster representative. Here, two
parameters 𝑚1and𝑚2are used for fuzzy partition and membership
degrees respectively. So erroneous or faulty value of these parameters
can still affect the balance between privacy and utility. The k-means
technique is utilized in [30] to propose a Reversible Privacy-Preserving
k-means Clustering (kRPP) algorithm that protects the clustering in-
formation of a data set. When the noise ratio or noise offset ratio is
increased, the inserting noises to a cluster with a minimal total distance
in the kRPP method has no significant effect on centroids movement.However, kmeans algorithm is not suitable idea for protecting privacy
because this algorithm can worsen the attack resilience.
The authors of [31] suggested a data perturbation approach that
follows min–max normalization. The technique starts with choosing the
sensitive features and then applying min–max normalization to them.
The altered attributes and the actual data are then blended in and
some assessment is performed using this data. In this approach, min–
max normalization has been used which is not suitable for the full
feature data set. The security is jeopardized by the significant changes
in the values’ positions in the matrix. The authors of [8] suggested an
approach which follows 3D rotation transformation. The technique is
accomplished by rotating the attributes of data in a set of triplets. Then
the angle of rotation is determined by thresholding to the variance of
the attributes [32]. The balance between privacy and utility can be
hampered because it uses a mixture of clockwise and anti-clockwise
rotation for a better privacy at the expense of utility.
𝑃2𝑅0𝐶𝐴𝑙is a privacy-preserving technique suggested by the authors
of [4]. For balancing privacy and utility in data sets, this method
makes use of rotation and condensation characteristics. In one version
of this method, kmeans was used. This kmeans algorithm delivers better
utility, but sometimes privacy suffers and attack resistance declines.
A non-reversible perturbation method namely PABIDOT is proposed
in [3] that uses optimal geometric transformation for privacy preser-
vation of huge data. It uses multidimensional geometrical alternation,
reflection, translation, and rotation to disrupt a data set, followed by
randomized expansion and random tuple shift out.
For the sake of stream data mining privacy, two data perturbation
methodologies are presented in [6] which use random projection, ran-
dom translation, and two distinct additive noise structure in a coalition.
Independent noise, which is produced for each individual entry, is one
of the noise types. The other type of noise accumulates during the
course of a stream’s lifetime.
In [33], the authors proposed a new data perturbation algorithm,
SEAL (Secure and Efficient data perturbation Algorithm utilizing Lo-
cal differential privacy) which relies on Chebyshev interpolation and
Laplacian noise. SEAL offers a fair balance of privacy and utility with
high efficiency and scalability. In [34], the sensitive information of
individuals is perturbed via a fuzzy data transformation technique. The
technique uses a fuzzifier to transform linguistic data from crisp values
so that the inference engine can compare them to the fuzzy rules which
had already been stated. Then using a defuzzifier, perturbed data is
then translated from the generated linguistic values to crisp values. In
this approach, while perturbing the data, privacy is preserved, but the
utility can be neglected.
Another approach namely RG+RP is proposed in [35] which con-
sists of two stages. Each individual’s data is perturbed in the first stage
by running it through a nonlinear function called repeated Gompertz
(RG); in the second stage, a specific random projection (RP) matrix is
used to project the perturbed data to a lower dimension in a (almost)
distance-preserving manner. Random projection avoids independent
component analysis (ICA) attacks and ensures clustering accuracy,
while maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation attacks are mitigated by
the nonlinear RG function. The recovery resistance of the proposed two-
stage randomization method is evaluated in terms of MAP estimation
assaults.
The authors of [36] discussed a method called value swapping.
There exists no erroneous information as a result of value swapping.
While retaining data set wise properties, methods like value swap-
ping [36], condensation [19], random projection [35] and additive
noise [6] sacrifice the secrecy of individual records by substituting
sensitive information with less sensitive records.
Most of the existing methods still lacks in balancing the privacy and
utility. Still a trade-off between utility and privacy has been noticed.
In our work, the two proposed approaches follow a combination of
normalization and some different transformations. When undergoing
these various transformations, normalization aids in maintaining theArray 20 (2023) 100324
4M. Rahman et al.
Euclidean distance between data points as closely as possible to the
original data. And the combination of normalization and the transfor-
mations helps to preserve geometric features including length, inner
product, hyper-plane forms, and hyper-curved surfaces. As our methods
go through several stages of transformations, more data is being dis-
torted. So the privacy of the data is being preserved. Thus our methods
are able to provide significant degree of privacy and keep the utility at
the same time.
3. Overview of perturbation technique
There are various number of innovative and effective approaches for
preserving privacy. Each technique has advantages and disadvantages
of its own [37]. For obtaining individual’s privacy, several of the pertur-
bation techniques employ many changes to the original data streams.
Data privacy can be protected using these perturbation techniques
and also the data utility is expected not to be overlooked. However,
centralized and distributed scenarios can be initially classified as PPDM
approaches [5]. This classification is determined by the position of
computing for data mining performance. The perturbation method
is well-suited to both centralized and distributed computing applica-
tions [38]. Perturbation techniques alter the original data before data
mining activities. In most circumstances, individual records cannot be
recovered, but aggregate distributions can [5]. All aggregated distri-
butions are significant for data mining and analytical jobs. However,
adversaries will have a difficult time extracting concealed information
about individuals from the skewed published data [39]. There are
two types of data perturbation techniques [40] — unidimensional
and multidimensional data perturbation. Random noise addition is the
most frequent unidimensional data perturbation technique, which is
mathematically [41] expressed as Eq. (1).
𝑥′
𝑖=𝑥𝑖+𝑟𝑖 (1)
where𝑥𝑖signifies the initial data value in a one-dimensional situation,
𝑥′
𝑖represents the equivalent value of the processed data, and 𝑟𝑖means
random noise from a distribution such as the Gaussian distribution. Uni-
dimensional data perturbation strategies cannot give accurate mining
results because data mining tasks necessitate knowledge from several
correlated data dimensions [5,42]. On the contrary, multidimensional
data perturbation approaches retain statistical information. When a
value from the original multidimensional data is hidden, this is likewise
true [42]. Multidimensional data perturbation methods change data
across all dimensions. Multidimensional data perturbation procedures
suffer from less information loss than uni-dimensional data perturba-
tion strategies because a lot of statistical data is stored in various
dimensions [5]. Random rotation transformation is described in [43]
as Eq. (2).
𝑔(𝑋) =𝑅𝑋 (2)
Here R stands for random rotation matrix, X for original data attribute
sets, and g(X) for changed attribute sets. The utility is maintained while
the privacy of the user’s data is increased through random rotation
transformation.
4. Evaluation metrics
Perturbation approaches are commonly evaluated using two types
of metrics: privacy metric and data utility metric. The most effective
perturbation strategies aim to protect privacy and also maintain data
utility. As described below, we have employed different criteria to
quantify data utility and privacy in this study.
4.1. Privacy of data
The complexity of estimating the actual data items from the altered
data is referred to as privacy [5]. We evaluated six different metrics
to assess data privacy security in this study: Secrecy [5,44], Value
Difference (VD) [5,45], RP [5,45], RK [5,45], CP [5,45], and CK [5,45].4.1.1. Secrecy
The variance of actual and altered data values has traditionally been
used to characterize the secrecy of a perturbation method [44]. Secrecy
is defined as follows:
𝑆𝑒𝑐𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑦 =𝑉𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 (𝑥𝑖−𝑥′
𝑖)
𝑉𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 (𝑥𝑖)(3)
where𝑥𝑖stands for a single original data attribute, while 𝑥′
𝑖stands
for the perturbed data attribute. This metric, secrecy measures privacy
by comparing the initial data contents of an altered attribute to those
which can be examined.
4.1.2. VD
VD uses the relative value difference in the Frobenius norm to
express changes in original data items [45]. When the initial data values
of a data matrix are altered, it is defined as the following equation in
Frobenius norm [45].
𝑉𝐷=‖𝐴−𝐴′‖𝐹
‖𝐴‖𝐹(4)
where Frobenius norm is denoted by the subscript F, A denotes the
actual data stream, and A’ stands for the altered data stream.
4.1.3. RP
The ranks of the related data elements are altered when a data
matrix is perturbed. The rank-based measure RP can be used to reflect
mean changes in all attribute-specific ranks [45]. For example, we
consider the data set 𝐷𝑚×𝑛, which has n attributes and m instances.
RP is now defined as Eq. (5), where 𝑅𝑖
𝑗represents the rank of the 𝑗th
element of the original data matrix 𝐴𝑗𝑖for the𝑖th attribute and 𝑅𝑖′
𝑗
represents the 𝑗th element’s rank of the perturbed data stream 𝐴′
𝑗𝑖for
the𝑖th attribute.
𝑅𝑃=∑𝑛
𝑖=1∑𝑚
𝑗=1|𝑅𝑖
𝑗−𝑅𝑖′
𝑗|
𝑛𝑚(5)
4.1.4. RK
Even after being perturbed, some data items can keep their dis-
tinct magnitude ranks for each of the attributes. RK can express the
percentage of such data components [45]. It is depicted as Eq. (6).
𝑅𝐾=∑𝑛
𝑖=1∑𝑚
𝑗=1𝑅𝑛𝑖
𝑗
𝑛𝑚(6)
Here𝑅𝑛𝑖
𝑗indicates if an element maintains its rank during the data
perturbation process. 𝑅𝑛𝑖
𝑗is characterized as the following equation:
𝑅𝑛𝑖
𝑗={
1,if𝑅𝑖
𝑗=𝑅𝑖′
𝑗
0,otherwise(7)
4.1.5. CP
The rank of the average value of each attribute is predicted to vary
following the perturbation of data items. CP [45] can indicate such
variations in rank of the average value of attributes as Eq. (8).
𝐶𝑃=∑𝑛
𝑖=1|(𝑅𝐴𝑉𝑖−𝑅′
𝐴𝑉𝑖)|
𝑛(8)
where𝑅𝐴𝑉𝑖denotes the rank of the mean value of the 𝑖th attribute in
ascending sequence. On contrary, 𝑅′
𝐴𝑉𝑖is rank of the mean value of the
𝑖th perturbed attribute in ascending sequence.
4.1.6. CK
After data perturbation, CK can reflect the percentage of qualities
that can keep their respective ranks of the average value [45]. CK can
be depicted as Eq. (9).
𝐶𝐾=∑𝑛
𝑖=1𝐶𝑛𝑖
𝑛(9)
here𝐶𝑛𝑖is characterized as the following equation:
𝐶𝑛𝑖={
1,if𝑅𝐴𝑉𝑖=𝑅′
𝐴𝑉𝑖
0,otherwise(10)Array 20 (2023) 100324

4.2. Utility of data
Utility generally means the amount of important data about a data
stream which is necessary for data mining activities [5]. We employed
two utility metrics in this study, which are described next.
4.2.1. Accuracy
It represents how many instances are correctly predicted with re-
spect to total observations. The percentage of appropriate results made
by data mining algorithms is measured by accuracy [5,46]. Hence, the
accuracy is defined as follows:
𝐴𝑐𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑦 =𝑇𝑃+𝑇𝑁
𝑇𝑃+𝐹𝑃+𝑇𝑁+𝐹𝑁(11)
where TP is true positive, TN is true negative, FP is false positive and
FN means false negative. The confusion matrix specifies all of these
variables [47].
4.2.2. F1-score
The F1-score combines the precision and recall into a single metric
by taking their harmonic mean. A balance between recall and precision
can be established by F1-Score [5,46]. If precision P and recall R, then
F1-Score can be defined as Eq. (12).
𝐹1 −𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 = 2 ∗𝑃∗𝑅
𝑃+𝑅(12)
where𝑃=𝑇𝑃
𝑇𝑃+𝐹𝑃and𝑅=𝑇𝑃
𝑇𝑃+𝐹𝑁are the precision and recall,
respectively.
4.2.3. Precision
Precision is the probability that a data is relevant once the algorithm
has returned it [48]. A model’s total number of positive predictions
divided by the proportion of true positives is known as precision [49].
Precision can be written in regards to true positives and false positives
(FP) as follows [49]:
𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 =𝑇𝑃
𝑇𝑃+𝐹𝑃(13)
4.2.4. Recall
Recall can be defined as the likelihood of retrieving a relevant
data [48]. Recall is the ratio of true positives to total number of actual
positives [49]. Recall can be written as follows [49]:
𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙 =𝑇𝑃
𝑇𝑃+𝐹𝑁(14)
5. Proposed approach
The proposed NOS2R approach consists of normalization, scaling,
shearing and reflection. Then the NOS2R2 approach is the combination
of NOS2R and 3D rotation transformation. The NOS2R algorithm is
shown in Algorithm 1.
The proposed approach starts by using the data matrix 𝐷𝑚×𝑛as
input, where n represents the total number of attributes and m repre-
sents the total number of instances. At first, the data set is normalized
to make it standardized. In NOS2R, The data set 𝐷𝑚×𝑛is normalized
using z-score normalization because it performs better than alternative
normalization methods for the full feature data set [50]. Table 1 data
set is normalized and the result is shown in Table 4. When rescaling
an attribute, z-score normalization helps to re-scale it. For rescaling,
the attribute’s mean and standard deviation is used [5]. As a result, it
generates a characteristic with a unit variance, zero mean, and good
handling of outliers. It can be defined by the following Eq. (15) [50].
𝑥′
𝑖=𝑥𝑖−𝜇𝑖
𝜎𝑖(15)
where the normalized form of the 𝑖th attribute is represented by 𝑥′
𝑖,𝑥𝑖is
original𝑖th attribute. 𝜇𝑖means the mean and 𝜎𝑖represents the standard
deviation of 𝑖th attribute.Algorithm 1: NOS2R Perturbation

Then scaling transformation is used to alter the data matrix 𝐷1𝑚×𝑛
after normalization. Scaling is one of the fundamental transformations.
The process of transformation entails changing and moving the current
points. Scaling is applied to alter or modify an object’s size. Scaling
factors are used to make the shift [12]. The item size will either be
increased or decreased depending on the scaling factor [51]. The data
size increases if the scaling factor is greater than 1. It is known as
magnification [12,51]. The data size is decreased when the scaling
factor is less than 1 which is called reduction [12,51]. Thus the data
distortion is materialized by the magnification or reduction of the data
value. The general form of scaling transformation can be written as
Eq. (16) [12]:
𝑃′=𝑆.(𝑃) (16)
For ease of understanding the scaling matrix [12] is given below
which we have used for data distortion.
𝑆=⎡

⎢⎣𝑆𝑥 0 0

Setting𝑆𝑥=1,𝑆𝑦=2 and𝑆𝑧=3, the normalized data matrix 𝐷1𝑚×𝑛
given in Table 4 is scaled using the scaling matrix S. The transformed
data matrix 𝐷2𝑚×𝑛looks like Table 5.
After scaling, the data stream 𝐷2𝑚×𝑛is deformed using shearing
transformation. Shearing changes the shape of the object. Shearing can
be done in the three directions as follows [52]:
•Shearing in X-direction
•Shearing in Y-direction
•Shearing in Z-directionArray 20 (2023) 100324

In the case of shearing in the X-direction, the coordinate of X remains
unchanged and the coordinate of Y and Z is changed. For shearing
in the Y-direction, the coordinate of Y remains unchanged while the
coordinate of X and Z is changed. Similarly, when shearing is done
along the Z direction, the coordinate of Z remains unchanged while
the coordinate of X and Y are changed. For the explanation let us see
the shearing matrices as shown in Table 6 [52].
The data distortion takes place through shearing along X axis by the
following equations [52] when P (x, y, z) is the initial data point and
𝑃′(𝑥′,𝑦′,𝑧′)is the altered data point.
𝑥′=𝑥 (17)
𝑦′=𝑦+𝑆𝑦∗𝑥 (18)
𝑧′=𝑧+𝑆𝑥∗𝑥 (19)
Similarly, shearing along Y axis performs the data alteration as
follows [52]:
𝑥′=𝑥+𝑆𝑥∗𝑦 (20)
𝑦′=𝑦 (21)
𝑧′=𝑧+𝑆𝑧∗𝑦 (22)
Again, data contortion is transpired through shearing along Z axis
by the given equations [52]:
𝑥′=𝑥+𝑆𝑥∗𝑧 (23)
𝑦′=𝑦+𝑆𝑦∗𝑧 (24)
𝑧′=𝑧 (25)
The shearing transformation is done through step 3 to step 5 in the
NOS2R algorithm. At first, 𝐷2𝑚×𝑛is transformed using 𝑆ℎ𝑥and𝐷3𝑚×𝑛is
generated. Then 𝐷3𝑚×𝑛is transformed using 𝑆ℎ𝑦and𝐷4𝑚×𝑛is generated.
After that,𝐷4𝑚×𝑛is transformed using 𝑆ℎ𝑧and𝐷5𝑚×𝑛is generated. The
corresponding data matrices after shearing along X, Y and Z axis are
given in Table 7, Table 8 and Table 9 respectively. To do so, let us use
𝑆𝑥=2,𝑆𝑦=2.5 and𝑆𝑧=3.
After shearing, reflection is done. The data value that is reflected
always takes shape on the opposite side of the mirror. As the distance
between a data point P and the mirror is same as the distance between
the reflected point 𝑃′and the mirror, the reflection transformation canTable 8

The reflection matrices along planes are given in Table 10. The reflec-
tion transformation takes place through step 6 to step 8 of algorithm
1. The reflected data matrix of our example is shown in Table 11.
This resultant data matrix of reflection transformation is the per-
turbed data set using the NOS2R method. And finally the rotation
transformation is applied on the resultant data matrix of Algorithm 1
according to Algorithm 2.
In this study, 3D rotation was accomplished using the double rota-
tion matrices shown in Table 12 [8]. Therefore for rotating the data set
using geometric multiplication, three attributes of the relevant data set
must be executed simultaneously. As an execution unit, we employed
three sequential attributes ( 𝐴𝑖,𝐴𝑗,𝐴𝑘)∈𝐷8𝑚×𝑛and termed it a triplet.
Triplet production is simple if the number of attributes is like 3t in total,
where t = 1, 2, 3, etc. When there are 3t + 1 number of attributes,
the third attribute is combined with the first two to form a triplet. For
example, if the final attribute is n, the attributes of the triplet are [n −2,
n−1, n]. The triplet can be created by combining the attribute n −2 with
n−1 and n, if there are a total of 3t+2 attributes. Then the attributes
of the triplet are [n −2, n−1, n]. Here, 𝑡1= [Customer ID, Account
number, Amount of Transaction ] and𝑡2= [Account number, Amount of
Transaction, Current Balance ] are the triplets used in our example. Due
to the fact that Table 11 has 3t + 1 attributes where t = 1, Account
number and Amount of Transaction are repeated to construct 𝑡2with
the Current Balance.
Multiple rotation angles are produced once the initial triplet is
created using the sequential first three attributes. By setting 𝜃= 0.1
to 360, a 3D rotation matrix 𝑅𝜃is produced. In line 6 of Algorithm 2,
a rotation is done by the matrix multiplication of ( 𝐴𝑖,𝐴𝑗,𝐴𝑘) and𝑅𝜃Array 20 (2023) 100324

which results in the triplet like ( 𝐴′
𝑖,𝐴′

𝑘). The variances 𝜈1,𝜈2, and𝜈3
are then calculated in line 8 by computing 𝜈𝑎𝑟(𝐴𝑖−𝐴′
𝑖),𝜈𝑎𝑟(𝐴𝑗−𝐴′
𝑗)and
𝜈𝑎𝑟(𝐴𝑘−𝐴′
𝑘) respectively. Step 9 of Algorithm 2 compares variances 𝜈1,
𝜈2, and𝜈3to the security thresholds st =[ 𝛿1,𝛿2,𝛿3] where𝛿1,𝛿2,𝛿3>0
and the inequalities are 𝜈1> 𝛿1,𝜈2> 𝛿2and𝜈3> 𝛿3. We applied
the security thresholds to ensure that the rotated triplet’s attributes
fulfill a minimum variance. For other triplets, these security criteria
might be different. Every triplet may differ in variance range because
of this. Then the variances and the angles are selected for which
the inequalities become true. The covariance matrix of the relevant
triplet’s components was then added to the resulting difference matrix’s
covariance matrix to calculate the overall variance. Then in line 12 of
Algorithm 2, 𝜃𝑚is calculated that yields the highest total variance. Then
this𝜃𝑚was used to generate the final perturbed data set.
After applying rotation, the resultant data set is the final perturbed
data set of NOS2R2 approach. The perturbed data set of our example
is shown in Table 13 where we have used Z axis as rotation axis and 𝜃
= 38◦as the angle that provides maximum variance.
The block diagrams representing NOS2R and NOS2R2 are given in
Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 respectively.6. Performance analysis
6.1. Data set
For the purpose of the evaluation, ten UCI data set were used.
Table 14 provides a full summary of the data set that were used. Data
sets with multiple dependent variables and characteristics were utilized
for analysis activities. Only numerical attributes are included in the
data set. The majority of the data set contains confidential information.
A fair selection procedure was used.
6.2. Classifiers and experimental set-up
Various classification techniques are used by different classifiers
[53]. We have used one benchmark classifier named Decision Tree
(DT) [54]. A decision tree is a tree-based method where each path
leading from the root is characterized by a data separating sequence
up until a Boolean result is attained at the leaf node [54]. In these tree
structures, the leaves stand in for class labels and the branches signify
the combinations of features that result in those class labels [55]
We have used MATLAB R2020a as the implementation platform.
The existing methods 3DRT and NRoReM and the proposed methods
NOS2R and NOS2R2 are implemented using MATLAB R2020a. We
also calculated the privacy metrics using MATLAB. After that,for the
classification model, Weka 3.8.5 has been employed to generate data
mining results. The selected measures are Accuracy, F1-score, Precision
and recall values. The analysis tasks are carried out using 10-fold
cross-validation. After calculating these utility and privacy metrics, we
plotted those data using Microsoft Excel. The data values were plotted
in different types of graphs such as: line graphs, dot plot and bar charts.
We used Microsoft Excel to generate all these types of graphs. We
used a machine with the following specifications: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-
6200U CPU @ 2.30 GHz 2.40 GHz; RAM: 8.00 GB; system type: 64-bit
Operating System, x64-based processor.
6.3. Analysis of privacy
We have studied the privacy-preserving performance of NOS2R and
NOS2R2 utilizing the metrics which were described in Section 4.1.
Again an increase in information entropy and ICA attack analysis [41]
was evaluated to measure its privacy-preserving capabilities. The pro-
posed NOS2R and NOS2R2 approaches are mostly related to NRoReM
[5] and 3-Dimensional Rotation Transformation (3DRT) [8]. That is
why, in this work, NOS2R and NOS2R2 are compared to 3DRT and
NRoReM.
6.3.1. Privacy protection
NOS2R and NOS2R2 both have the potential to protect individuals’
privacy. The secrecy level for NOS2R and NOS2R2 are higher than that
of both existing approaches which we have used in this study. Table 15
shows the secrecy level comparison.
The mean Friedman test ranks are provided in the final row of
Table 15. A lower FMR value denotes a lower level of secrecy, whereas
a higher value denotes a higher level of secrecy. According to the exper-
iment’s test statistics: chi-square 𝜒2value of 28.08 and the probability
value p is less than 0.00001. The 𝑝-value shows that the variations
in secrecy levels between 3DRT, NRoReM, NOS2R and NOS2R2 are
significant. We can conclude from the Friedman Mean Rank (FMR)
data that NOS2R offers better secrecy than 3DRT and NRoReM. And
NOS2R2 provides the greatest secrecy level. As reported by our study,
both NOS2R and NOS2R2 offer better secrecy across all the data set
compared to NRoReM and 3DRT. Even NOS2R2 provides higher secrecy
than our proposed first method NOS2R. So our proposed both methodsArray 20 (2023) 100324

work well than the existing 3DRT and NRoReM approach. And among
all the methods NOS2R2 method is superior.
VD, RP, and CP should have higher values for improved privacy
protection; however, the value of CK and RK should be lower [45].Table 16 shows the value of VD, RP, RK, CP and CK. Here, it is seen
that, at least two of the metrics show that the NOS2R strategy protects
more privacy compared to 3DRT and NRoReM for 90% the data set
and NOS2R2 works better for all the data set. Similarly, in case ofArray 20 (2023) 100324

three metrics, for 80% the data set, NOS2R protects more privacy than
3DRT and NRoReM; NOS2R2 offers more privacy for all the data set.
Again, using four metrics among those five demonstrate that NOS2R
and NOS2R2 provide higher level of privacy for 70% the data set and
90% the data set respectively than both existing approaches which we
have used in this study. Moreover, NOS2R2 is compared against 3DRT,
NRoReM and NOS2R.
It is seen that, at least two metrics demonstrate the superiority of
NOS2R2 than others for all of the data set and that of for 90% of the
data set for at least three and four metrics.Table 17

6.3.2. Attack resistance
There are various sorts of attacks which are addressed against data
perturbation methods. One of the attacks is Independent Component
Analysis (ICA), which aims to recreate the original data from the altered
data [41]. The attack resistance of NOS2R and NOS2R2 is evaluated
against an ICA attack because it is based on matrix multiplication.
When there is a bigger difference between the altered and actual data,
the ICA attack becomes more challenging.
Table 17 shows the values for ICA attack analysis. The values
represent the standard deviation of the difference between the ICA-
reconstructed data and the initial data. The last row shows the FMR
values for the comparison of the existing and proposed approaches.
Here the chi-square 𝜒2value and the probability value, p are 22.35 and
0.000055 respectively, where p demonstrates the significance of the
variations in ICA attack resistance among all the methods. According
to our analysis, NOS2R offers 33% higher resistance against ICA attack
than 3DRT and 11.5% higher resistance than NRoReM. And NOS2R2 is
the most resistant method against ICA attack. NOS2R2 is 39.2% more
resistant to ICA attack than 3DRT and 15.5% more resistant against ICA
attack than NRoReM. So our proposed both methods work better than
the existing 3DRT and NRoReM approach. And among all the methods
NOS2R2 method is superior in case of attack resistance.
6.3.3. Increase in information entropy
Information entropy indicates the amount of information contained
in an event. The average rate of information production from a random
source of data is known as information entropy. Shannon’s entropy can
be used to calculate the information entropy of a data set. The formula
of Shannon’s entropy is given in Eq. (27) [3].
𝐻(𝑋) = −𝑛∑
𝑖=1𝑃(𝑥𝑖) log2𝑃(𝑥𝑖) (27)
where H(X), a discrete random variable which denotes the entropy
of X, with X = < 𝑥1,𝑥2,…,𝑥𝑛>.𝑃(𝑥𝑖)represents the probability of
occurrence of 𝑥𝑖and∑denotes the summation over X.
Using Eq. (28) [3], the average information entropy increase are
determined.
𝐴𝐼𝐸 =∑𝑛
𝑖=1(𝐻(𝑥′
𝑖) −𝐻(𝑥′
𝑖))
𝑛(28)
Here,𝐻(𝑥𝑖)is the entropy for every attribute of the original data set.
Similarly,𝐻(𝑥′
𝑖)stands for every attribute’s entropy of the altered data
set. AIE represents an average increase in information entropy. When
the AIE values are greater than 0, it means that the altered data set
have more impurities than the original data set. Fig. 3 shows the AIE
for 3DRT, NRoReM, NOS2R, and NOS2R2. The bar chart shows that, the
entropy level is greater for NOS2R compared to NRoReM and 3DRT for
90% the data set. Also, NOS2R2 provides higher entropy than 3DRT,
NRoReM and NOS2R for 90% of the data set. Our experimental analysis
says that, NOS2R provides 6.94% higher entropy than 3DRT and 3.44%
higher entropy than NRoReM. Furthermore, NOS2R2 provides 17.72%
higher entropy than 3DRT and 15.48% higher entropy than NRoReM.Array 20 (2023) 100324

6.4. Analysis of utility
From Table 18, it is seen that the accuracy of NOS2R and NOS2R2
are more similar to that of the original data than NRoReM and 3DRT.
For over 70% data set, NOS2R outperforms NRoReM and 3DRT. And
for 80% data set, NOS2R2 approach performs on a greater scale.
The absolute differences in classification accuracy shown in
Table 19 demonstrate this analysis. Table 19 displays the differences
between the accuracy found in the altered data set by 3DRT, NRoReM,
NOS2R and NOS2R2 and that of the original data set.
From this accuracy difference, it can be said that the accuracy of
NOS2R is 28.62% closer to the original data than 3DRT and 16.81%
closer than NRoReM. As well, NOS2R2 is 50.5% closer to the original
data than 3DRT and 42.32% closer than NRoReM.
It is also obvious from the analysis of Eq. (29) that the utility
of NOS2R and NOS2R2 approach are maintained. The classification
accuracy of the original data set, Ro, and the perturbed data set, Rp,
are both expressed in Eq. (29). The value of eindicates the lowest levelover which the utility of the classifiers can be maintained.
𝐸=𝑅𝑝− (1 −𝑒)𝑅𝑜 (29)
For this analysis, eis set to 0.03068. Then it is observed that the
classifier is able to maintain the utility in case of NOS2R and NOS2R2;
however fail in case of 3DRT and NRoReM for this lowest value of e.
That is why eis set to 0.03068. In Fig. 4, this is depicted.
𝐸𝑚𝑖𝑛values are plotted along the 𝑦-axis of the graph in Fig. 4 and
are calculated as follows: At first, the minimum error returned for each
strategy is identified. This is carried out for every data set. Next, a plot
is made using the value of minimum error for every method. These 𝐸𝑚𝑖𝑛
values are displayed against ewhich initializes at 0.1 since Fig. 4 shows
that𝐸𝑚𝑖𝑛is positive for greater values of e.
The utilities of the data set that the classifier, decision tree return,
are maintained if Eq. (29) shows that the value of error E ≥0. As
a result, we found that the utility of NOS2R and NOS2R2 can be
maintained for e= 0.03068 but fail for 3DRT and NRoReM, as shown in
Fig. 5. If we further decrease the value of eand set at 0.03067, then the
utility for NOS2R2 is preserved but fail for 3DRT, NRoReM and NOS2R
as well for this value of e. This is shown in Fig. 6.
The𝑦-axis in Figs. 5 and 6 shows𝐸𝑚, the minimum error. It has been
found that NOS2R and NOS2R2 perturbation successfully preserves
the utility of the entire data set for the lowest value of e= 0.03068.
However, it turns out that 3DRT and NRoReM do not preserve 100%
utility for the same value of e.
Besides accuracy, f1-score analysis is helpful to evaluate the effec-
tiveness of classification algorithms on a larger scale. The bar chart in
Fig. 7 shows that where analysis of accuracy compromises, the NOS2R
approach provides 43.65% better result than 3DRT and 22% closer f1-
score to original data than NRoReM. Again the NOS2R2 perturbation
method outperforms all of the 3DRT, NRoReM and NOS2R approaches
in terms of f1-score. NOS2R2 results in 50.25% closer f1-score to origi-
nal data than 3DRT and 31.22% closer f1-score compared to NRoReM.
Furthermore, Precision is another important metric for utility eval-
uation. The bar graph in Fig. 8 demonstrates that, NOS2R algorithm
yields precisions that are 48.03% and 21.89% better than 3DRT and
NRoReM respectively. Similarly, NOS2R2 approach generates preci-
sions which are 53.93% and 30.77% closer to original one in compar-
ison to 3DRT and NRoReM respectively.
In addition to the other utility metrics, recall analysis is also of
utmost significance. Fig. 9 illustrates the recall values for the existing
and proposed methods. From Fig. 9, it can be found that the recall
values for NOS2R is 21.4% and 16.15% closer to original one than
that of 3DRT and NRoReM methods respectively. All of the 3DRT,Array 20 (2023) 100324
11M. Rahman et al.
Fig. 4. Selecting the value of e.
Fig. 5. Classification errors for e = 0.03068.
NRoReM, and NOS2R techniques are outperformed by the NOS2R2
perturbation method while evaluating recall values. NOS2R2 algorithm
offers 39.85% and 35.82% better recall values than 3DRT and NRoReM
respectively.
Hence, we see that the existing approaches are outperformed for
the majority of the data set by NOS2R and NOS2R2. A comparative
summary has been provided in the Table 20. Thus our methods provide
better balance between privacy and utility. Our proposed methods work
much better than the existing methods. But in case of big data there
is an uncertainty regarding the amount of time these approaches will
take.
6.5. Discussion and shortcomings
For most of the data set, NOS2R and NOS2R2 surpass 3DRT and
NRoReM, but they fall short in a few instances. NOS2R is a four stagedata perturbation technique and NOS2R2 is five stage data perturbation
technique. The improved performance is a result of all phases of
NOS2R and NOS2R2. Normalization helps to maintain a close rela-
tionship of euclidean distances of the data points. Normalization is
followed by scaling transformation. Scaling can be used to modify
an object’s size. The coordinate values can be multiplied by scaling
factors to achieve this. The original coordinate X can be multiplied
by a scaling factor to get the modified coordinate X’. Then shearing
transformation is done. Shearing also causes a change in object’s shape
and the data value and a new shape is appeared. Thus shearing play
a vital role in preserving privacy as the data value is changed and
a new shape is appeared. Again, geometric reflection and rotation
are isometric transformations [ 56]. NOS2R uses scaling, shearing and
reflection transformation. and NOS2R2 uses rotation along with these
transformations. Rotation and reflection are strict isometric transforma-
tion. Scaling is not isometric transformation, but it still can maintainArray 20 (2023) 100324

the similarity [ 56]. Thus scaling, rotation and reflection are used to
maintain the utility. But in our work, to increase the level of privacy,
a 3D rotation matrix with a mixture of clockwise and counterclockwise
directions has been employed (for example, the 𝑧-axis is counterclock-
wise, the other two axes are clockwise). The rotated data points’ spatial
representation therefore varies in a number of ways which conflicts
with maintaining utility. Several new study directions have been made
possible by this work. To begin with, other transformations or methods
can be applied with this work to compare the utility and privacy
preservation. The proposed approaches might be used for other data
mining tasks, such as regression, clustering, and so on. Currently, we
have used numerical data to validate our methods. Adapting these
methods to deal with categorical data can be potential avenue for future
research. Again, investigating alternative attacks is another crucial
topic for future research. ICA attack analysis has been employed inthis work. Further attacks can be put under consideration for a better
analysis.
7. Conclusion
The main goal of this research work is to perturb the data for
preserving privacy along with maintaining the utility at the same time.
Data perturbation techniques are applied to multivariate data set in or-
der to change the original data items. The recent perturbation methods
frequently address the trade-off between privacy and data utility. The
proposed NOS2R and NOS2R2 approaches perturb all the features of
the data set. The data items are standardized using a normalization
process, which is followed by scaling, shearing, reflection and rotation.
Thus the data elements are distorted. But the data set’s geometrical
shapes remain constant. This property facilitates in maintaining the
original data set’s utility and the composite transformation significantlyArray 20 (2023) 100324

increases privacy to a significant level. Then the results of the proposed
methods are compared with the other existing methods. And the pro-
posed two methods provide better results than the existing methods.
NOS2R and NOS2R2 perturbation approaches maintain data utility and
preserve individual privacy on a larger scale for 90% data set. However,
the work proposed in this paper can be well extended with feature
reduction in multiparty clustering scenarios.
