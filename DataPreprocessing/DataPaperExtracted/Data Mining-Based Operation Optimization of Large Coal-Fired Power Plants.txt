Abstract 
Large coal-fired power generation is a complex  process characterized as nonlinear and coupling correlation between the levels of equipment, subsystems and function modules. It is therefore difficult to describe the energy-consumption behaviour and optim ize the operation parameters under different operation conditions and boundary conditions with conventional methods. With data mining methods such as Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Genetic Algorithm (GA), a huge amount of practical operation data stored in the plant-level Supervisory Information System (SIS) were used to model the energy consumption and optimize the operation parameters for less coal consumption.  The results show that the power coal rate reduced significantly under the combination of SVR and GA. The optimal operation program has a practical feasibility, and the whole optimizing process can supply  model basis for large coal-fired power units.  © 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.

 1  Introduction Large coal-fired power unit is a complex nonlinear system with more uncertainties to describe the energy-consumption behaviour, evaluate the coal rate for power generation and optimize the practical operation. The operation optimization problem can be described as Model (1), which consists of two parts: a optimum target such as the highest power efficiency or the minimum coal consumption, and a couple of constraints such as the power load, coal quality, ambient factors and operation conditions. The expression of such optimization problem is explicit but it is difficult to determine the optimal targets in operation optimization of power units, especially considering the varying boundary constraints, operation conditions and system features.

()0igX  and ()0jhX  are the constraint conditions demonstrating the ambient and operation conditions of power units. Commonly used optimal targets mainly cover the designed values from the fabricants of power equipment, the test benchmark conducted on site and the calculation results based on mathematic modelling of power units. There are several limitations of these methods such as low efficiency, inexplicit description and local optimization features; in addition, they are frequently impracticable, costly and time-consumed, for a power unit is a complex nonlinear system with mo re uncertainties to describe, evaluate and optimize for different boundary and operational conditions.  The increasing development of measuring, monitoring and information technologi es strive a highway for the operation optimization of power units including  data processing, uncertainty measuring, intelligent modelling and expert system building
[2~5]. Clustering and fuzzy associated rules-based methods are used in process control and individual parameter optimization such as excessive air flow and boiler efficiency
[2,5]; neural network (NN) and SVR methods are introduced to model the NO
X emission of the coal-fired boiler and the operation parameters are optimized with ant colony optimization algo rithm (ACO) and GA method. This made a reference for the operation optimization of power plants. In this paper, SVR and GA are used to model th e coal consumption behaviour and determine the optimum value of operation parameters. GA shows its  priorities in two sides: to select the modelling parameters of SVR
[4] and to optimize a set of key operation parameters to obtain the optimum values, at which the coal rate for power generation falls into the least under different operation conditions. 2 Related knowledge on SVR and GA 2.1   Overview on Support Vector Regression  As an emerging technology of data mining, support vector machine (SVM) was originally proposed by Vapnik in 1990s to solve the classification problem, which is based on the VC principle and structure risk minimization principles
[3] With a substantial foundation and systematic reasoning; SVR is of the favourable features in unique solution, global optimization and strong  generalization. SVR   problem is described as:  Given the training samples set:

                                        (3)              In SVR model, there are three factors, i. e. the ty pe of kernel function, kernel function parameter and punish coefficient, dramatically affecting the accuracy, complexity and generalization ability of the model built with SVR. For this, it is important to select and optimize the above parameters
[4]. 2.2   Overview on Genetic Algorithm GA is one of the optimization algorithms, which is de rived from Darwin's genetic choice and biological evolution process of natural selection. GA is a gl obal optimization algorithm with strong commonality, robustness and promising applications in machine learning, process control, economic forecast and optimization
[9~10]. It consists of the following 7 main components: string coding, initialization, fitness function, selection operation, crossover operation, mutation operation and stop criterion.  2.3 GA-based  model parameter selection and operation optimization As shown in Figure 1, GA is introduced in this paper for both the parameter selection of SVR model and the optimization of operation parameters. The optimi zation process includes the following six steps: Step 1
Initial parameter Settings. Preset GA algorithm population scale, selection operation, crossover operation and mutation operation and termination evol ution algebra. Choose operation selection scale selection operator, crossover operation using single poi nt crossover operator, mutation operation use basic for mutation operator. Step 2
Coding and the generation of initial population. According to stay optimization parameter , C, 
 and operation parameters of the optimal interval and precision requirements, to determine to optimize parameters of the chromosome length, the parameters are binary coding.  610   Ningling Wang et al.  /  AASRI Procedia   3  ( 2012 )  607 – 612
