Main aim of this study is to develop a software prototype tool for grading and diagnosing depression thatwill help general physicians for ﬁrst hand applications. Identiﬁcation of key symptoms responsible fordepression is also another important issue considered in this study. It involves collection of data takenfrom patients through doctors. Due to several reasons, collection of data in Indian scenario is extremelydifﬁcult and thus this tool will be very handy and useful for general physicians working at remote loca-tions. Also, it is possible to collect a data pool through this software model. An intelligent Neuro-Fuzzymodel is developed for this purpose. Performance of the said model has been optimized through twoapproaches. In Approach 1, where a back-propagation algorithm has been considered and in Approach2, Genetic Algorithm has been used. The model is trained with 78 data and validated with 10 data.Approach 2 superseded Approach 1 in terms of diagnostic accuracy. Therefore, it can be said that the softcomputing-based diagnostic models could assist the doctors to make informed decisions. Data for train-ing and validation for this purpose has been collected during 2004–2005 from a Government mental hos-pital in India./C2112017 The Authors.

1. IntroductionWHO says ‘‘depression is a common illness worldwide” and it isa growing risk[1–3]. There could be several factors contributing todepression and it is closely related to physical health [1–3]. There exist known and effective treatment procedures, which reach lessthan half of the sufferers[1,4]. There are several reasons such aslack of trained professionals and lack of resources [1], silent pro- gression[5], social stigma[6]and perception difference amongdoctors leading to ‘under’ or ‘over’ diagnoses [7]. So, diagnosis has to be proper to reduce the disease load [8]. SC techniques are applied for screening and diagnosing the dif-ferent ailments[9,10]in the last couple of decades. Clusteringtechniques alone are applied for grading of depression [11]. How- ever, Chattopadhyay et al.[12]combined fuzzy logic with cluster-ing for capturing the symptoms psychiatric diseases of humanbeing. They later developed a NN-based toolbox for grading ofadult depression[13]and classiﬁed it into three categories namely,‘mild’, ‘moderate’, and ‘severe’[13]. Tai and Chiu[14]used RBFN to understand the reasons for suicidal tendencies of Taiwanese sol-diers. Chattopadhyay[15]developed a fuzzy-based automatedmodel for grading depression. Later stage, Chattopadhyay et al.[16]tried to minimize the overlapping among the three differentgrades of depression. Regression analysis is also used for the sim-ilar purpose by Chattopadhyay and Acharya [17]. It is understood from the literature that grading of depression isa difﬁcult task. It is mainly because of the non-availability of thedata. It may of different reasons which are indicated below.(i). social stigma,(ii). majority of the patients do not approach to psychiatristsﬁrst, they approach to general physicians and when itbecomes severe then comes to the psychiatrists,

(iii). non existence of systems of collecting data by the doctors.For the ﬁrst time reporting to the doctors, majority of thepatients are prescribed medicines. As a result true pictureof the patients are not available to the doctors,(iv). inferior health management system.Therefore, basic purpose of our study is to develop a prototypetool which forecasts depression better than the general physicians.In this context, SC-based techniques are found to provide formid-able solutions. However, performance of SC-based techniquesdepends on its formulation and optimization of the same. Out ofdifferent SC-based models, neuro-fuzzy models are ﬁnding wideapplications in the recent times in different ﬁeld with high predic-tion accuracies[18,19]. Development of a neuro-fuzzy-based soft-ware prototype model has been made in this study. It has beenobserved that, the performance of neuro-fuzzy systems dependson its DB and RB[20]. In majority of the case, user deﬁned thesame, which in no sense becomes optimal. Some researchers triedto combine different SC-based techniques. Therefore, the maincontribution of this work is the development of a neuro-fuzzy-based prototype model for grading depression. Later, performanceof the developed approach was made through two optimizationmethods, namely back-propagation algorithm and genetic algo-rithm. The model will be used by the general physicians for collect-ing more data. After proper validation with large set of data, it willbe given for use to the psychiatrists/experts of mental health prob-lems. Presently, the model is validated using data given by the clin-icians. However, the model is evolutionary in nature and thus, itmight handles uncertainty, impreciseness present (which are pre-dominant) in the system in much broader way.The developed neuro-Fuzzy model and its optimization proce-dures using two approaches are described in Section 2and results have been analyzed in Section3. Final outcomes of the work arediscussed and future directions are mentioned in Section 4.2. MethodologyCollecting depression data is very difﬁcult. It is because of dif-ferent reasons such as (i) prevailing social stigma, especially inthe developing nations, (ii) difﬁculties in accessing the psychia-trists as they are very few in numbers, (iii) non-existence of systemfor collecting data by the doctors and so on. Together it leads toreal a challenge in obtaining the clean data. The basic aim of thisstudy is to build a software toolbox that will be of help for theGPs, who is the ﬁrst point of contact to the patients and data willbe possible to be collected.2.1. Data collectionA study is made on 312 patients reported to one of the famousmental hospital in India in the year 2004–2005. Those patientsreported to the hospital for the ﬁrst time and they did not takeany medicines before reporting to the hospital. They are thengrouped in two. First group belongs to the patients who have sui-cidal ideations and require immediate treatment. However,patients belonging to the second group (total 88 patients) werefurther analyzed towards the severity of depression. Therefore,there exist 88 data; out of which 78 has been used for training/optimizing the neuro-fuzzy architecture and rest 10 have beenused for testing the performance of optimized architecture. Sevencommon symptoms (FS, LP, WL, IN, H, LA, PA) are then observedby three senior psychiatrists. Doctors are then requested to quan-tify the symptoms and severity of depression with which those 88patients are suffering.2.2. Neuro-fuzzy model constructionA Mamdani-type[21]NN-FL model was developed by Hui et al.[20]is used in this study for grading depression (refer to Fig. 1). Interested readers may go through the paper of Hui et al. [20,22] for detailed discussion on the development of NN-FL system. Inthe present study, seven inputs representing the seven differentsymptoms and one output representing the depression is used.Three different grades of the inputs are considered ( m,Mands). The data base of the NN-FL system is shown in Fig. 2. Since there are three possibilities (i.e., mild, moderate and severe) of the loadof each of seven inputs, there will be 3
7= 2187 numbers of possible input combinations, for which grades of depression would vary asmild, moderate and severe, based on the symptom load. Manuallyconstructed rules are presented inTable 1and one particular rule (say the ﬁrst rule of the above table) looks like:IfFSism&LPism&WLism&INism&Hism&LAism&PAis mTHENDepressionisM.For more details related to rule based selection, identiﬁcation ofrelevant rules, optimization using GA and gravitational searchalgorithm, interested readers may go through [23–31]. The performance of the above NN-FL system largely depends onthose rules and different weights such as V
1,V2,V3,V4,V5,V6,V7
and W 1. The NNFL system will have variable structure only whenrule base of the FLC is optimized i.e., some rules are deleted. Thereexist a large number of literatures for developing an optimal NNFLsystem. In the present study two different approaches have beenadopted. Both these two approaches have been explained belowin brief.2.3. Approach 1: Tuning using a BP algorithmIn this approach, RB is kept unaltered during its training. Onlythe weights V
1,V2,V3,V4,V5,V6,V7and W 1are optimized using BP algorithm[32]. It is usually implemented through the mini-mization of Mean Squared Error (E) in prediction, as given below.

2.4. Approach 2: Tuning using genetic algorithmApproach 1 suffers from the local minima problem. Also, inApproach 1, only the weights are optimized. Therefore, inApproach 2, optimization of both DB and RB is attempted using aGA. GA with 4454-bits long string is used for this purpose. DataK. Ashish et al. / Applied Computing and Informatics 14 (2018) 98–105 99base is represented by ﬁrst 80 bits (10 bits for each variable). Rest4374-bits are used to express the rule base (two bits to represent arule: 00 for medium, 01 and 10 for moderate and 11 for severe). Astring will look like the following.

The detailed working principle of combined GA-NN-FL is avail-able in[20,22]. Since GA is a population based search and eachpopulation is to be assigned a ﬁtness, mean squared error (referto Eq.(1)) in prediction of degree of depression is considered asthe ﬁtness for each population. GA aims at ﬁnding that particularsolution which gives lowest error in predicting degree of depres-sion. Also, through this approach, it is possible to reduce the num-ber of rules.2.4.1. Identiﬁcation of redundant/unimportant rulesIt is very difﬁcult for a doctor to remember a large number ofrules. Some of the GA-optimized rules may be redundant (are notimportant) in the context of the problem. Therefore, it will be nicerto eliminate them from the rule base. However, identiﬁcation ofredundant rules is difﬁcult. In this paper, we have planned to iden-tify them using the concept of importance factor. Rules having rel-atively low importance factors are called as redundant and may bedeleted from the rule base. It is to be done in such a way so thatnon-ﬁring of rules does not occur.Let us suppose that nijdenotes the number of times that the jth
linguistic term (j = 1 for mild, j = 2 for moderate and j = 3 for sev-ere) for the i
thinput condition (i.e., corresponding to different inputvalues) is ﬁred during training. In this way, total numbers of ﬁredrules are represented by N. Thus, the probability of occurrence ofthe j
thlinguistic term for the ithinput condition may be given asfollows
pij¼nij
N;where i¼1;2;3;...2187 and j¼1;2;3:ð6Þ
The probability of occurrence of a rule will indicate the neces-sity of keeping that rule in the RB. It is then multiplied with theworth of a rule (i.e., contribution of any linguistic term towardsthe output) to determine the importance factor. We have assumedthe worth of any linguistic term for the depression follow a Gaus-sian distribution pattern. The maximum worth is taken to be equalto 1 when error in prediction is zero. Otherwise it decreases withthe increase in error.Let us say that, C

The importance factor of a rule may be determined as follows

A particular rule is considered to be redundant if the impor-tance factor of that rule is very low and can be eliminated onlywhen non-ﬁring does not arise. Let us understand the samethrough an example. If we consider, S = 0.3, P = 0.3, W1 = 0.3,I1 = 0.3, H = 0.3, A = 0.3 and P1 = 0.3. So, all the inputs can be clas-siﬁed as either mild (m) or moderate (M) (refer to Fig. 2). Therefore, at a time 2
7= 128 rules out of existing 2187 rules will be ﬁred.Now, out of those 128 rules, if one such rule is absent in the rulebase, there will be a non-ﬁring of such a rule. One training/test sce-nario represents one input set, resulting in possibility of a maxi-mum 128 non-ﬁring situations. Therefore, during training with78 training cases, there is a possibility of 128 /C278 = 9984 non- ﬁring situations, if for every case all the ﬁred rules are absent.Moreover, FLC is tuned using GA, therefore, maximum possiblenon-ﬁring situations = maximum number of generations /C2 populations/C29984.3. Results and discussionsTwo approaches as explained in Section 2are used to train NN- FL system. Out of the 88 data, 78 are used for training and 10 areused for validation. During this process, all the weights are variedin between 0.1 and 0.45. In Approach 1, learning rate ( g) is system- atically varied in range of 0.01–0.5 and result is noted. Fig. 3shows the variation of
gwith MSE and best result is obtained with
g= 0.05. This study is done considering the number of iterationsequal to 15. Lowest MSD is found to be equal to 0.0116043 (refertoFig. 4). Through this process optimal weights are found to beV
1= 0.4161; V 2= 0.4469; V 3= 0.4507; V 4= 0.4469; V 5= 0.4405; V
6= 0.4232; V 7= 0.4357 and W 1= 0.3425.Fig. 2.DB of the input and output variables.

Ashish et al. / Applied Computing and Informatics 14 (2018) 98–105 101Three GA parameters inﬂuence the performance of Approach 2.Therefore, GA parametric study is carried out systematically vary-ing other parameters keeping one parameter constant for each runof algorithm. During this process, crossover probability is set at 0.5.The best mutation probability is determined varying it within0.01–0.1 in a step of 0.01. Similarly, optimal number of GA popula-tion is also obtained. Finally, with the best mutation probabilityand population size, GA is run for 500 generations and optimalparameters are noted.Figs. 5–7show the corresponding results.An attempt has also been made to identify the redundant rulesand thereafter those rules have been removed from the rule base.The importance factors thus found for all the rules during the train-ing is presented inFig. 8. After removing certain number of ruleswhich were found to have lower values of importance factor, thenumber of non-ﬁred scenarios and the corresponding errors forboth the training set (containing 78 data sets) and the test set (con-taining 10 data sets) were calculated and tabulated in Table 2. Zero non-ﬁred scenarios have been observed with the removal of 500rules out of 2187 during test cases and only 25 non-ﬁred situationshappened for the training data-sets. Therefore, ﬁnal result has beentaken removing 500 rules from the rule-base. The reason behindremoving 500 rules is – (i) it does not give rise to any non-ﬁring sit-uations of the rule base for the test cases and (ii) no furtherimprovement in error in prediction. It has been observed that thereexist three different zones of importance factors. Moreover, nearbyrules (say rule no 1819 and 1820) have same large importance fac-tors. It might have happened because of the following reasons: (a)there are only three linguistic terms representing depression (mild,moderate and severe). Therefore, there could be three differentzones of the importance factor. Each zone will have some mean

Ashish et al. / Applied Computing and Informatics 14 (2018) 98–105and a range, (b) high value of importance factor means more num-ber of ﬁring of such a rule during the process. Since we have con-sidered triangular membership function distributions, which aresymmetric in nature, therefore, rules having linguistic terms mildand moderate will have chance of ﬁring at the same time.Following things have been observed in the rule base./C15Type A:835 rules out of total 2187 rules have not been modiﬁedby the GA. It clearly indicates that those are the rules in princi-ple and even their important factor is low, still they can neverbe omitted from the rule base. For example, Rule nos. 1822and 1823 are of such a rule (refer to Table 3). /C15Type B:1106 rules out of total 2187 rules have been modiﬁedslightly (i.e., mild to moderate, moderate to severe, moderateto mild, severe to moderate). For example, Rule nos. 1795 and1796 are of such a rule (refer toTable 3). It indicates that there is a overlapping in the decision making process of the doctorsand they often could not clearly deﬁned the rules. Authors havearranged these rules according to their importance factor anddeleted those which have low importance factor.

Ashish et al. / Applied Computing and Informatics 14 (2018) 98–105 103/C15Type C:286 rules out of total 2187 rules have been modiﬁed lar-gely (i.e., mild to severe and severe to mild, for example rulenos. 1 and 9 ofTable 3). These are hypersensitive rules and exis-tence in the rule base causes wrong prediction. Therefore,authors tried to eliminate those rules as a whole and havenoticed no change is observed in terms of non-ﬁring scenarios.It is also important to mention that rule no. 1823 is the best rulein terms of importance factor and it is also a rule in principle.Table 4shows the predicted depression values corresponding tothe ten test cases. Percentage error in prediction is found to be lowleaving the tenth case. It indicates that the developed model is agood ﬁt one. Moreover, less percentage error is seen with Approach2. It may be due to the optimized rule base in the Approach 2.Performance of the best NN-FL system i.e., Approach 2 is com-pared with a NN-based classiﬁer system. The NN-based system willhave a three layered 7-6-1 architecture and the results have beenpresented inTable 5. It has been observed that the predicteddepression by Approach 2 is much closer to the target depressioncompared to NN-based system. It may be due to the fact thatlogic-based controller works well in modeling depression ofhumans.4. Conclusions and future workIn this study, an attempt has been made to develop a NNFL sys-tem for diagnosing depression based on seven different symptoms.Performance of NNFL-based diagnosing tool is improved throughGA-based optimization. Both rule base as well as data base hasbeen optimized using GA. Unfortunately, GA took huge time toevolve the good solution. There are reported works which havebrought down the time consumed while running a GA-based opti-mizer in machine automation. However, it is important to notehere that diagnosis of depression consumes months to get diag-nosed even by an expert psychiatrist and therefore speed is outof the scope of the paper. Still, to reduce the time the paperattempts to identify the redundant rules and analysis has beenmade to remove them by identifying the load of individual ruleson the morbidity. Finally, performance of the optimized GA-tuned NNFL system is compared with that of back-propagationbased NNFL system for ten different cases. It was found that theperformance of GA-tuned NNFL system is better compared to theother one. Moreover, it has been observed that GA-tuned NNFL sys-tem has outperformed to a NN-based system. Therefore, Approach2 can be of great help to the doctors for diagnosing the patientssuffering from depression.Presently forward mapping has been between the symptomsand the disease. However, it will be much more interesting if thereverse mapping is made, where it will be possible to identifythe impact of a symptom on the disease. The authors are presentlyworking with this problem. It is also worth noting while reviewingliterature we have come across few works on the said problems.AcknowledgmentsAuthors are grateful to the doctors who helped them to collectthe data and shared their experience.References[1] WHO: Depression. <www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs369/en/ >.
