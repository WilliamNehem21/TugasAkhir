Abstract 
The accuracy of the interpolation method for identification of nonlinear dynamical systems based on the Volterra model in 
the frequency domain is studied. To highlight the n-th partial component in the response of the system to the test signal 
the n-th partial derivative of the response using the test signal amplitude is found and its value is taken at zero. The 
polyharmonic signals are used as test ones. The algorithmic and software toolkit is developed for identification processes. 
This toolkit is used to construct the informational model of test system. The model is built as a first, second and third 
order amplitude–frequency characteristics and phase–frequency characteristics. The comparison of obtained 
characteristics with standard is given.

1. Introduction 
It is necessary to consider technical conditions of the communication channels (CC) operation for effective 
data transfer. Changes in environmental conditions cause  reducing the transmission data rate: in the digital 
CC- up to a full stop of the transmission, in analog CC - to the noise and distortion of the transmitted signals.

The new methods and supporting toolkit are developing to automate the measurement of parameters and taking into account the characteristics of the CC. This toolkit allows obtaining the informational and mathematical model of such nonlinear dynamic object, as the CC [1], i.e. to solve the identification problem. Modern continuous CCs are nonlinear stochastic inertial systems. The model in the form of integro-power Volterra series used to identify them [2–5]. The nonlinear and dynamic properties of such sy stem are completely characterized by a sequence of multidimensional weighting functions – Volterra kernels). Building a model of nonlinear dynamic system in the form of a Volterra series lies in the choice of the test actions form. Also it uses the developed algorithm th at allows determining the Volterra kernels and their Fourier-images for the measured responses (multidimen sional amplitude–frequency characteristics (AFC) and phase-frequency characteristics (PFC)) to simulate the CC in  the time or frequency domain, respectively [6]. The additional research of new method of nonlinear dynamical systems identification, based on the Volterra model in the frequency domain is proposed. This method lies in n-fold differentiation of responses of the identifiable system by the amplitude of the test polyharmonic signals. The developed identification toolkit is used to build information model of the test no nlinear dynamic object in the form of the first, second and third order model [8]. 2. Interpolation Method of Volterra Kernels Computation  An interpolation method of identification of the nonlinear dynamical system based on Volterra series is used [7–8]. It is used n-fold differentiation of a target signal on parameter–amplitude a of test actions to separate the responses of the nonlinear dynamical system on partial components

The main purpose was to identify the multifrequency performances characterizing nonlinear and dynamical properties of nonlinear test object. Volterra model in the form of the second order polynomial is used. Thus, test object properties are characterized by transfer functions of W
1(j), W 2(j 1,j2), W 3(j 1,j2,j3)  by Fourier-images of weight functions w
1(t), w 2(t1, t2) and w 3(t1, t2, t3). Structure charts of identification procedure – determinati ons of the first, second and third order AFC of CC are presented accordingly on fig. 1. 300   Pavlenko Vitaliy et al.  /  AASRI Procedia   4  ( 2013 )  297 – 305 
The weighted sum is formed from received signals – responses of each group (fig. 1). As a result the partial components of CC responses y
1(t), y 2(t) and y 3(t) are got. For each partial component of response the Fourier transform (the FFT is used) is calculated, and from received spectrum only an informative harmonics (which amplitudes represent values of required characteristics of the first, second and third orders AFC) are taken.

Conclusions 
The method based on Volterra model using polyharmon ic test signals for identification nonlinear dynamical systems is analyzed. To differentiate the responses of object for partial components we use the method based on composition of linear responses combination on test signals with different amplitudes. New values of test signals amplitudes were defined and model were validated using the test object. Excellent accuracy level for received model is achieved as in liner model so in nonlinear ones. Given values are greatly raising the accuracy of identification compared to amplitudes and coefficients written in [12]. The accuracy of identification of nonlinear part of the test object growth almost 10 times and the standard deviation in best cases is no more than 5%. Interpolation method of identification using the hardware methodology written in [13] is applied for constructing of informational Volterra model as an AP C of the first and second order for UHF band radio channel. Received results had confirmed significant nonlinearity of the test object characteristics that leads to distortions of signals in different type radio devices. In the further researches the received frequency characteristics of the CC will be used to decrease level of nonlinear distortions in telecommunication systems taking into account its nonlinear characteristics.
