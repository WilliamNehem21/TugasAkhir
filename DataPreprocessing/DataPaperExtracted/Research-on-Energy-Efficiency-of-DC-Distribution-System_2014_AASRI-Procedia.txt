consumption of these parts can be reduced, and then achieve the purpose of energy conservation. In the paper[12],it is studied that as the feeder voltage value of DC distribution system is two times than it in AC distribution system, the feeder loss of DC distribution system account for about 15%~50% to it in AC distribution system. In this paper, the energy efficiency of DC distribution system is treated. Firstly, the concept of DC distribution system is introduced, and the figure  of DC distribution system is showed. Then, energy efficiencies of the feeder, the power electrical devices and the load are analyzed, and their calculation models are established. Finally, the total energy efficiency of DC di stribution system is calculated and analyzed. 2. Energy Efficiency Analysis Of DC Feeder 2.1 Energy efficiency analysis models of DC feeder Energy efficiency index of power feeder mainly include that active power loss, transmission efficiency, energy loss and loss rate of feeder. The calculation m odels of AC feeder, monopole DC feeder and bipolar DC feeder are compared as follows. The operating mode of DC feeder is metal loop operating mode. Calculating model that active power loss of AC feeder is follow: 
rLU P PN Â˜ ') cos/(222M                                                        (1) Where P is active power loss consumed by load, U
N is rated feeder voltage of feeder, Mcos   is load power factor, r is feeder resistance every kilometre, L is feeder distance. Calculating model that active power loss of monopole DC feeder is follow:

distance of feeder is 3km.Then the active power consumed by load in the feeder is 3MW,and the power factor is set to 0.9.Finally,the cable voltages are set to  five grade: 10kVÇƒ15kVÇƒ20kVÇƒ25kVÇƒ30kV. 2.
 2.2 Analysis of calculating results 
Fig.1 The comparison of loss rate between AC feeder with DC feeder 
From Fig.1, it is reflected that the curves of transmission efficiency and loss rate in cable of YJV22, single-phase cross-sectional area is 240mm
2.We can compare the loss rate of AC feeder, monopole DC feeder and bipolar DC feeder according to these figures. By analyzing the result of the graph, efficiency of the power cable in a bipolar DC feeder that voltage level within a range from 10kV to 30kV is always optimal, and its advantage is obviously compared to AC feeder when  the voltage level is 10kV. As the voltage level rises, the efficiency advantages of bipolar DC to feeder AC feeder is narrowing. Therefore, it has the highest efficiency to supply power in bipolar DC feeder. 3. Energy Efficiency Analysis Of AC/DC, DC/AC And DC/DC The losses of AC/DC, DC/DC and DC/AC are not used to calculate, and cannot be computed simply by formula. Their energy efficiency is ascertained through table of power electrical devices efficiencies.

4. Energy efficiency analysis of office building 4.1 The power supplies of loads in the office building 4.1.1 The server From the power systems of the server in data center me ntioned above, the difference of energy efficiency between AC power supply and DC power supply is the power conversion devices and feeder losses. The power conversion devices include UPS, transformers and converters, etc. Figure.2 made it clear that within the server, the data switching equipment and other core IT equipments operate at the same voltage of DC. So whether in AC or DC power supply system, the energy consumption of the core device inside the server is the same in the same operating environment.
