Background:  Biomedical  knowledge  graphs (KG) have become crucial for describing  biological  ﬁndings  in a 
structured  manner.  To keep up with the constantly  changing  ﬂow of knowledge,  their embedded  information  must 
be regularly  updated  with the latest ﬁndings.  Natural language  processing  (NLP) has created new possibilities  
for automating  this upkeep by facilitating  information  extraction  from free text. However,  due to annotated  and 
labeled biomedical  data limitations,  the development  of completely  autonomous  information  extraction  systems 
remains  a substantial  scientiﬁc  and technological  hurdle. This study aims to explore methodologies  best suited to 
support the automatic  extraction  of causal relationships  from biomedical  literature  with the aim of regular and 
rapid updating  of disease-speciﬁc  pathophysiology  mechanism  KGs. 
Methods:  Our proposed  approach  ﬁrst searches  and retrieves  PubMed  abstracts  using the desired terms and 
keywords.  The extension  corpora are then passed through  the NLP pipeline  for automatic  information  extraction.  
We then identify triples representing  cause-and-eﬀect  relationships  and encode this content using the Biological  
Expression  Language  (BEL). Finally, domain experts perform  an analysis  of the completeness,  relevance,  accuracy,  
and novelty of the extracted  triples. 
Results: In our test scenario,  which is focused on the KG regarding  the phosphorylation  of the Tau protein, our 
pipeline  successfully  contributed  novel data, which was then subsequently  used to update the KG leading to the 
identiﬁcation  of six additional  upstream  regulators  of Tau phosphorylation.  
Conclusion:  Here, it is demonstrated  that the NLP-based  workﬂow  we created is capable of rapidly updating  patho- 
physiology  mechanism  graphs. As a result, production-scale,  semi-automated  updating  of pre-existing,  curated 
mechanism  graphs is enabled.  
1. Introduction  
Biomedical  literature  is a valuable  source of information;  typically  
expressing  high-level  knowledge  in the form of scientiﬁc  narratives  of- 
ten in an unstructured  format.  Presently,  publications  are growing  at 
an unprecedented  rate, therefore,  staying  up to date on the latest ﬁnd- 
ings by manually  reading  the literature  is no longer feasible  for a given 
ﬁeld of study. Thus, automated  extraction  of relevant  information  by 
applying  intelligent  natural  language  processing  (NLP) algorithms  has 
become  a crucial and non-trivial  task [1] . One of the most diﬃcult  chal-

have been essential  for the acceleration  of data-driven  drug discovery  
and drug repurposing  as they can incorporate  a broad range of biolog- 
ical scales and concepts  [6] . For example,  Domingo-Fernández  et al. 
developed  an algorithm  that prioritizes  drugs for a given disease  by rea- 
soning over causal paths in a KG [6] . In the context  of drug discovery,  
Knowledge  Graph Embedding  (KGE) models have also been explored  
and utilized  frequently  [5] . KGE models learn vector representation  of 
graph nodes and edges in low dimensional  space and embed entities  
and relations  of knowledge  graphs while keeping  the original  structural  
information  (such as the relations  between  entities)  [7] . In their study, 
Bonner  et al. investigated  a variety of KGE models to assess how dif- 
ferent factors such as the training  setup or their hyperparameters  can 
result in better prediction  in drug discovery  tasks [5] . In this regard, N. 
Sosa et al. [8] implemented  a literature-based  KGE method  with drug 
repurposing  application  in rare diseases.  
Inherently,  knowledge  evolves  rapidly  in many research  domains  of 
current  interest,  and thus an eﬃcient  update procedure  is in high de- 
mand for KG maintenance  [9] . Generally,  biomedical  KGs can be gen- 
erated in multiple  ways, ranging  from manually  aggregating  curated  
databases  [ 2 , 10 , 11 ] to techniques  such as NLP [12–14]  . To cope with 
the increased  number  of scientiﬁc  papers published  every day, NLP 
techniques  are quickly  becoming  the primary  method  by which rapid 
overviews  of thousands  of publications  can be generated  in seconds.  
NLP is often compromised  of a combination  of other technologies  and 
techniques  such as named entity recognition  (NER) [15] , relation  ex- 
traction  (RE) [16] , and document  or sequence  classiﬁcation  [17] . These 
core methods  have also been widely utilized  in domains  such as can- 
cer research  and clinical  decision  support  [18] . Pre-trained  language  
models such as BERT/BioBERT  are currently  among the most widely 
employed  language  representation  models that have proven to be ex- 
ceptionally  powerful  in biomedical  text mining [ 19 , 20 ]. As an example,  
in a recent work, a BERT-based  model was applied  for generation  of the 
high-quality  molecular  representations  in drug discovery  issues [21] . 
BERT models can employ  the encoder  part of the transformer  architec-  
ture so that the attention  mechanism  can then be utilized  for learning  
context  and relationships  in sequential  data [20] . BERT is trained  on text 
corpora  of general  domains,  whereas  BioBERT,  which is an extension  of 
BERT, is further re-trained  on domain-speciﬁc  biomedical  corpora  in- 
cluding  PubMed  database  [19] . 
To represent  scientiﬁc  ﬁndings  in a computable  format,  modeling  
of a data exchange  language  should be considered.  Extensible  Markup  
Language  (XML) [22] , Biological  Pathways  Exchange  (BioPAX)  [23] , 
Systems  Biology  Markup  Language  (SBML)  [24] , and Biological  Expres-  
sion Language  (BEL) [25] are currently  among the most widely utilized  
language  models in systems  biology.  BEL was developed  to assemble  
causal relationships  among biological  entities  with the underlying  meta 
data such as support  evidence  [ 23 , 24 ]. Furthermore,  BEL makes use of 
the concept  of namespaces  (e.g., Human  Gene Nomenclature  (HGNC))  
to ﬂexibly  normalize  entities.  Fig. 1 depicts a more detailed  example  
of a BEL statement.  More information  about BEL language  speciﬁcs  is 
provided  in the Supplementary  ﬁle. 
Further  research  was recently  conducted  to enable the automatic  ex- 
traction  and translation  of biological  relationships  directly  from scien- 
tiﬁc papers into BEL. The results of these studies can be subsequently  uti- lized to improve  the development  and updating  of causal KGs in biomed-  
ical domains  [ 27 , 28 ]. In the context  of drug discovery,  KGs representing  
causality  are becoming  essential  analytical  and inference  tools that can 
help in areas like target identiﬁcation  [29] . One recent example  of a 
cause-and-eﬀect  KG is the Human  Brain Pharmacome  (HBP), a drug- 
target mechanism-oriented  data model that combines  knowledge  from 
multiple  sources  [ 30 , 31 ]. Pharmacomes  link drug-target  information  
to speciﬁc  pathophysiology  mechanisms  and are ideal for rational  ap- 
proaches  toward the modulation  of pathophysiology  mechanisms  [32] . 
Although  the need for constant  maintenance  of KGs may appear triv- 
ial, the regular  updating  of “pathways  ”and other biological  associations  
remains  a challenge  for biocurators  and biomedical  knowledge  workers.  
Though  in most cases, changes  brought  on by evolution  and the com- 
pletion of knowledge  occur gradually  and smoothly  [33] , a fully auto- 
mated KG updating  procedure  imposes  a substantial  challenge  to the 
biomedical  research  community,  given the rapid pace of publishing  in 
the ﬁeld. Hence, our work had a singular,  pragmatic  focus: How can a 
tool be developed  for semi-automatic  updating  of the mechanism  and 
disease-speciﬁc  physiology  KGs starting  with limited data? In this work, 
we begin with the HBP and, due to its signiﬁcance  in neurodegenerative  
diseases  like Alzheimer’s  disease  (AD), we focus on the phosphorylated  
Tau (pTau) as a starting  point. Next, we introduce  and employ  an NLP- 
based workﬂow  to extract the BEL relationships  from relevant  literature  
contained  in the PubMed  database  and verify the correctness  and rel- 
evance of the extracted  triples by engaging  experts  before adding the 
newly encoded  information  to the KG. Finally,  we investigate  the NLP 
workﬂow’s  shortcomings  by analyzing  what is missing  during informa-  
tion extraction  and attempt  to improve  it. 
2. Related work 
Retrieval  of essential  information  from text, and therefore  mapping,  
creation,  and extension  of KGs are gaining  more attention  in biomedi-  
cal research.  Santos et al. [34] , as an example,  have presented  a clini- 
cal KG that supports  the harmonization  of proteomics  with other omics 
data while integrating  biomedical  databases  and scientiﬁc  publications.  
In another  work, Thomas  et al. [35] have recently  developed  a frame- 
work for modeling  causal activities  called Gene Ontology  Causal Activity  
Modeling  (GO-CAM)  to represent  more complex  statements  about bio- 
logical functions  in a structured  and scalable  manner.  Gene-product  in- 
teractions  are modeled  qualitatively  and causally  using GO-CAM,  which 
can in turn help answer complex  questions  about how gene product  ac- 
tivities interact  to carry out biological  functions  [35] . Their research  
also reveals a growing  trend toward modeling  cause-and-eﬀect  rela- 
tionships  in the context  of gene ontology.  Therefore,  there are several 
substantial  eﬀorts being made towards  the construction  of ontologies  
and causal KGs, most of which can be broadly  classiﬁed  as manual  or 
automatic/semi-automatic  and are summarized  below [ 33 , 36 ]. 
2.1. Construction  of KGs with manual curation  
Biomedical  KGs can be constructed  from manually  curated  databases  
which contain  pre-existing  data that can be merged  into a single KG 
2 N.S. Babaiha, H. Elsayed, B. Zhang et al. Artiﬁcial Intelligence  in the Life Sciences 4 (2023) 100078 
[ 10 , 11 , 37–39 ]. Manual  construction  of KGs requires  that experts  contin- 
uously read publications  to annotate  and identify  relevant  relationships  
or concepts  of interest,  which does ultimately  result in a high degree 
of accurate  information,  but at the expense  of time. One of the charac-  
teristics  of KGs built in this manner  is that they contain  precise data, 
although  the recall is low [ 2 , 40–43 ]. 
In a recent investigation,  Lage-Rupprecht  et al. [31] , developed  the 
Human  Brain Pharmacome  (HBP), a manually  and highly-curated  drug- 
mechanism-oriented  model that encompasses  a wide range of biological  
processes  relevant  to the pathophysiology  of AD. The HBP includes  a 
highly granular  representation  of mechanisms  describing  tauopathies,  
a group of neurodegenerative  diseases  distinguished  by the deposition  
of the abnormal  microtubule-associated  Tau protein  in the brain in the 
form of neuroﬁbrillary  tangles [31] . In their work, they established  a 
comprehensive  framework  in silico for identifying  druggable  mecha-  
nisms in the context  of Tau phosphorylation  (pTau) and created  a work- 
ﬂow for evaluating  likely therapeutics  that target AD-speciﬁc  patho- 
physiology  processes.  Brieﬂy,  they ﬁrst created  an initial version  of AD- 
speciﬁc  KG using the eBEL software  package  [44] which generated  a 
network  using a combination  of manually  curated,  AD-focused  BEL re- 
lations as well as established  biological  pathways  derived  from pub- 
lic repositories  including  KEGG [45] and Reactome  [46] . Using this 
KG, they selected  pTau as an entry point and identiﬁed  upstream  reg- 
ulators (secondary  interactors)  in the network  which modulate  that 
protein  [31] . The secondary  interactors  were then ranked according  
to deﬁned  criteria  (including  draggability),  and the top hits were se- 
lected for further evaluation.  In the case of the Tau drug repurpos-  
ing example,  these biochemical  assays led to the discovery  of novel 
target/compound  combinations  modulating  posttranslational  modiﬁca-  
tion of the Tau protein  [31] . Since the introduction  of HBP, several 
studies have worked  on drug discovery  for AD [47–52]  , which can in 
turn highlight  the necessity  for keeping  HBP up-to-dated  with recent 
ﬁndings.  
Though  manual  curation  is a labor-intensive  task and makes the gen- 
eration of KGs an expensive  undertaking,  it is still required  for the cre- 
ation of the highest  quality KGs. However,  to accelerate  KG construction,  
automatic/semi-automatic  approaches  are greatly desirable.  
2.2. Automatic/semi-automatic  approaches  for information  extraction  
The automated  and large-scale  generation  of biomedical  KGs can 
greatly beneﬁt several ﬁelds of research,  including  drug repurposing  
and drug-disease  identiﬁcation.  In this regard, Xu et al. [53] created  a 
pattern  matcher  system to recognize  words in PubMed  abstracts  that 
indicate  drug-disease  therapies.  Most automatic  information  retrieval  
systems  and KG creation  approaches  contain  NER and relation  extrac- 
tion (RE) subtasks  in their pipelines.  Regarding  this, in an investiga-  
tion, Kocaman  et al. [15] presented  a deep learning  framework  that 
performs  noticeably  well on biomedical  benchmarks  for NER task. Deep 
neural network  topologies  have also been proposed  regularly  for RE to 
improve  the prediction  performance  on several standard  benchmarks  
[ 16 , 34 , 54–56 ]. An article by Tudor et al. [57] explored  the use of text- 
mining algorithms  to detect protein  phosphorylation  events in relevant  
research  publications.  Likewise,  a knowledge  discovery  framework  was 
similarly  designed  to extract protein-protein  interaction,  gene-disease  
and drug-disease  interaction  from biomedical  scientiﬁc  publications  via 
text mining [ 58 , 59 ]. Speciﬁcally,  Wang et al. [60] examined  the text 
mining approaches,  modeling  resources,  systems,  and shared tasks intro- 
duced following  the emergence  of Coronavirus  pandemic  (COVID-19).  
In their review,  the qualitative  description  and evaluation  of each sys- 
tem’s performance  can reveal how these models can assist and provide  
information,  such as in the detection  of novel features,  or the potential  
to link scientiﬁc  articles  and clinical  trials [60] . 
In our work presented  here, we describe  our solution  for a rapid and 
eﬃcient  extension  of an existing  mechanism  KG using NLP technologies.  
In the following  section,  we provide  a detailed  description  of the primary  
data resources  and methodologies  that are adopted.  Table 1

3.1. Datasets  
3.1.1. Raw training  dataset 
To train the RE module  of the NLP pipeline,  we utilized  a train- 
ing dataset generated  by combining  several published  KGs. These KGs 
were built by expert manual  curation  on various  topics such as AD 
[ 28 , 61–68 ], Parkinson’s  Disease  [68] , epilepsy  [69] , amyotrophic  lat- 
eral sclerosis  (unpublished),  type 2 diabetes  [ 70 , 71 ], post-traumatic  
stress disorder  (unpublished),  traumatic  brain injury (unpublished),  
schizophrenia,  bipolar  disorder  (unpublished),  COVID-19  [ 62 , 72 , 73 ], 
and pTau modulation  [31] . The BEL statements  underlying  these KGs 
are extracted  from PubMed  abstracts  as well as full-text  documents.  
Table 1 summarizes  the information  regarding  the total number  of BEL 
nodes, edges, distinct  PMIDs,  and unique BEL statements  in this training  
dataset.  
3.1.2. Tau KG 
One subgraph  of HBP, which focuses  on the context  of pTau, serves as 
the primary  disease-speciﬁc  BEL causal KG that we sought update using 
our workﬂow  [31] . Table 1 summarizes  the key information  present  in 
this Tau KG: it contains  a total of 4,219 BEL nodes, 5,704 BEL edges, and 
5,173 unique BEL triples all of which were derived  from 256 diﬀerent  
publications  identiﬁed  using their PubMed  Identiﬁers  (PMID).  
3.1.3. Extension  corpus 
The extension  corpus was created  for updating  and expanding  the 
Tau KG. To create this collection,  we used the E-utilities  API [ 74 ] to 
search and retrieve  abstracts  from PubMed  using “Tau ”as the primary  
keyword,  and extracted  all abstracts  published  between  May 2020 and 
May 2022. The distribution  of abstracts  belonging  to the context  of Tau 
phosphorylation  and its post-translational  modiﬁcation  are shown in 
Table 2 . 
3.2. Knowledge  graph expansion  workﬂow  
A pictorial  overview  of the KG expansion  workﬂow  is provided  in 
Fig. 2 and consists  of the following  steps: 
• Starting  with the initial mechanism  KG, we query PubMed  for rele- 
vant medical  subject headings  (MeSH)  terms and keywords  consis- 
tent with the context  of the KG. Here, we extracted  PubMed  abstracts  
dealing  with Tau phosphorylation  and its post-translational  modiﬁ-  
cation. The abstracts  extracted  from this step constitute  the extension  
corpus.  
• Next, an NLP-based  BEL extractor  pipeline  that is pre-trained  to ex- 
tract BEL relationships  from biomedical  text is applied  to the exten- 
sion corpus.

Fig. 3. A high-level  overview  of the subtasks  
within the NLP pipeline.  
• The extracted  BEL statements  are then manually  checked  for correct-  
ness and completeness  by domain  experts  and only the high-quality  
triples are added to the KG. 
• Finally,  by applying  graph-based  mining and analysis,  we search for 
novel regulators  of pTau in the updated  KG. 
3.3. Training  and development  of NLP workﬂow  
To extract BEL statements  from unstructured  text and test the 
problem-solving  capacity  in translational  biomedicine  application  ex- 
amples,  we partnered  with the Kairntech  research  and product  develop-  
ment team [75] . We employed  the Kairntech  Sherpa workﬂow,  which is 
a web-based  collaborative  and completely  open source platform  that 
provides  essential  NLP requirements  for the extraction  of cause-and-  
eﬀect statements  [76] . In this pipeline,  the NLP workﬂow  is subdivided  
into multiple  subtasks  as represented  in Fig. 3 . First, after tokenizing  
and segmenting  the input text, NER is applied  and biomedical  enti- 
ties are identiﬁed  in the text. The extracted  entities  are then linked to 
their speciﬁc  database  identiﬁers  through  a named entity disambigua-  
tion (NED) approach.  In Sherpa,  NER and NED are integrated  into the 
same component  using a machine  learning  tool named Entity Fishing  
[77] . Then, to determine  speciﬁc  properties  of the recognized  entities  
(e.g., protein  modiﬁcations),  a dedicated  model is trained  and inserted  
into the NLP pipeline.  In the following  step, a neural network-based  RE 
module  known as OpenNRE  [78] is used to determine  the type of re- 
lations between  entities.  OpenNRE  is an open-source  tool that allows 
one to perform  RE in diﬀerent  settings  such as at sentence-level  or at 
bag-level.  In this work, we used sentence-level  RE and utilized  the de- 
fault BERT-base-uncased  tokenizer  [ 20 , 78 ] as the basis for our entity 
encoder.  The RE model was then ﬁne-tuned  using the recognized  en- tities and their corresponding  sentences  from the BEL training  corpus 
which was formerly  described.  
Finally,  the pipeline  encodes  results in the BEL format for subsequent  
integration  into the KG. Before the training  began, a randomly  selected  
subset of the training  corpus was deﬁned  and set aside to monitor  the 
training  procedure.  
3.4. Evaluation  scheme 
Automated  extraction  of BEL triples from text is a diﬃcult  task 
due to the high level of expressiveness  in the biomedical  domain.  Be- 
sides, there are some limitations  of the BEL syntax, terms, and func- 
tions [79] , moreover,  not all information  encoded  in a BEL document  
can be directly  found in the evidence  text. There may also be several 
diﬀerent  perspectives  on how or which speciﬁc  information  should be 
coded in BEL [79] . Therefore,  our goal was to create ﬂexible  evalu- 
ation guidelines  and a schema  to assess the performance  of the BEL 
extraction  module  so that a BEL statement  can be accurately  labelled  
based on how “correct  ”i t is. As depicted  in Fig. 4 , this evaluation  
rubric assigns one of six categories  to each triple according  to how ac- 
curately  the BEL statement  describes  the associated  support  evidence.  
This schema  also helps to determine  the level of correctness  of each 
extracted  statement  and to better understand  where the NLP pipeline  
can be improved  when extracting  BEL relationships.  Based on these 
guidelines,  we selected  triples that were of high-quality  to be further 
evaluated.  Domain  experts  then analyzed  and ﬁltered  the high-quality  
triples, and this ﬁnal subset was subsequently  added to the Tau KG. 
Table 3 showcases  a few examples  of extracted  BEL triples and their 
associated  correctness  label. These correctness  labels are deﬁned  as the 
following:

ness of the extracted  triples, a BEL curation  team consisting  of four anno- 
tators with both biology  and data science  backgrounds  was formed.  We 
then randomly  selected  more than 50% of the extracted  triples and the 
team manually  evaluated  the quality of this dataset based on the above- 
deﬁned  evaluation  criteria.  The result of this evaluation  is represented  
in Table 6 . Additionally,  the inter-annotator  agreement  rate for the en- 
tire dataset was computed  by three BEL-expert  annotators  with several 
years of experience  in BEL curation.  For this calculation,  1,000 anno- 
tated triples were randomly  selected  and given to this second BEL ex- 
pert team who then computed  the percentage  of annotations  that match 
across all annotators.  In this study, the inter-annotator  agreement  rate, 
meaning  the percentage  of BEL triples that were annotated  with the 
same sense by all annotators,  stands as 371 out of 1000 triples. Finally,  
we chose a selection  of high-quality  triples as decided  by subject-matter  
experts  for inclusion  in the KG. Table 7 illustrates  the result of the second 
round of manual  evaluation  as well as the inter-annotator  agreement  
rate. 
4.3. Enrichment  analysis  
The visualization  of the updated  BEL KG centered  around pTau is 
represented  in Supplementary  File (Fig. S9). Moreover,  this KG can also 
be visualized  with the Biomedical  Knowledge  Miner (BiKMi)  web tool, 
which is accessible  at https://bikmi.pharmacome.scaiview.com/  . After 
the high-quality  BEL triples were added to the KG, we used BiKMi and 
identiﬁed  six additional  interactors  that are related to the modulation  
of Tau phosphorylation.  Brieﬂy,  we ﬁrst chose the target, which is the 
Tau protein,  and only selected  the entities  that have phosphorylation  as 
the protein  modiﬁcation.  Then, we identiﬁed  upstream  regulators  of the 
modiﬁed  target by considering  the direct causal relations.  Next, we se- 
lected interactors  that are druggable,  meaning  those for which there ex- 
ist drugs from DrugBank  [ 86 ] that target them. These upstream  interac-  tors are apolipoprotein  E (ApoE),  Legumain  (LGMN),  phosphodiesterase  
11A (PDE11A),  protein  kinase cGMP-dependent  1v (PRKG1),  Alpha- 
synuclein  (SNCA)  and TANK-binding  kinase 1 (TBK1).  Among  them, 
only ApoE, PDE11A,  and TBK1 were shown to be druggable.  Finally,  we 
searched  several sources  and databases,  including  protein-protein  inter- 
action networks,  gene-disease  databases,  and pathway  databases  to val- 
idate and enrich the information  about the identiﬁed  potential  targets 
against  neurodegenerative  diseases,  including  AD. We have summarized  
this information  in the following  sections.  
4.3.1. Interactor  TBK1 
TBK1 is a protein-coding  gene that has been associated  with dis- 
eases such as encephalopathy,  acute frontotemporal  dementia,  and amy- 
otrophic  lateral sclerosis  4 [87] . TBK1 is also shown to be involved  in au- 
tophagy  and inﬂammatory  responses,  too [88] . More speciﬁcally,  loss- 
of-function  (LoF) mutations  in the TBK1 gene, including  frameshift  mu- 
tations and inﬂame  amino acid deletions  have been associated  to a vari- 
ety of neurodegenerative  diseases  [88] . However,  the role of TBK1 in the 
modiﬁcation  of tau phosphorylation  linked to AD or other tauopathies,  
is not yet well-understood  [89] . In a recent study, H.Abreha  et al. 
employed  immunoaﬃnity  enrichment  coupled  with mass spectrometry  
(MS) and identiﬁed  TBK1 in human cortical  brain tissue as a regulator  
of tau hyperphosphorylation  [89] . In a related study, Xiang et al. sum- 
marized  the knowledge  on inhibitors  of TBK1 that may be candidates  
for therapeutic  approaches  in many diseases,  such as inﬂammation  or 
metabolic  diseases  or pancreatic  cancer [90] . However,  no TBK1 kinase 
inhibitor  is currently  authorized  by the US Food and Drug Administra-  
tion (FDA). 
4.3.2. Interactor  Apolipoprotein  E (ApoE) 
ApoE gene is known to be a major genetic  risk factor of late-onset  AD, 
with the ApoE ∗ 𝜀 4 allele being shown to be a high-risk  element,  while 
the ApoE ∗ 𝜀 2 allele serving  as a potential  neuroprotective  variant [91] . 
Following  this, Yu et al. reported  in a recent study that ApoE may be 
protective  in neuronal  activity,  but its toxic fragments  are linked to neu- 
rodegeneration  and neurocognitive  impairment  among those with AD 
[92] . Their study also highlights  that the diﬀerences  in ApoE fragments  
expressed  in the hippocampus  of mice of diﬀerent  ages lead to variability  
in Tau phosphorylation  and neurocognitive  functions  and mechanisms  
[92] . Various  animal studies have demonstrated  that pathological  (poly- 
merized)  Tau drives cerebral  atrophy,  however,  the mechanisms  that ex- 
acerbate  Tau pathology  or Tau hyper-phosphorylation  in ApoE4-carriers  
are not known [93] . R. Saroja et al., claim that the astrocyte-secreted  
protein  glypican-4  is a key driver of ApoE4-mediated  Tau abnormal  hy- 
perphosphorylation  [93] . A variety of therapeutic  approaches  on tar- 
geting ApoE4 for preventing  or treating  Alzheimer’s  disease  have been 
highlighted  in a recent review by Williams  et al. [94] . However,  be- 
cause the mechanisms  underlying  ApoE isoform-speciﬁc  diﬀerences  in 
brain homeostasis  are complex,  it remains  unclear  which ApoE-related  
therapeutic  approaches  are applicable  in vivo [95] . 
4.3.3. Interactor  PDE11A  
PDE11A  is a protein-coding  gene that is related to primary  pig- 
mented  nodular  adrenocortical  disease  and is associated  with the GPCR 
downstream  signaling  pathway  [87] . In a recent study, exome sequenc-  
ing performed  by Qin et al., revealed  that the PDE11A  variant led to 
signiﬁcantly  higher Tau phosphorylation  levels and therefore  PDE11A  
could be a candidate  gene for early-onset  AD [96] . Previously,  two rare 
mutations  in the phosphodiesterase  PDE11A  gene were identiﬁed  in 
people with early-onset  AD [97] . Their study conﬁrmed  signiﬁcantly  
decreased  protein  levels of PDE11A  in brain samples  of AD patients  
[97] . Furthermore,  the expression  of PDE11A  variants  was proven to 
be associated  with the increased  Tau hyperphosphorylation  in context  
of AD [97] . In another  research,  Fawcett  et al. used molecular  cloning  
to characterize  PDE11A  and reported  that it is responsive  to zapri- 
nast, dipyridamole,  and the nonselective  PDE inhibitor  3-isobutyl-1-  
6 N.S. Babaiha, H. Elsayed, B. Zhang et al. Artiﬁcial Intelligence in the Life Sciences 4 (2023) 100078 
methylxanthine  (IBMX)  [98] . It has also been observed  that each of the 
four PDE11A  splice variations  (PDE11A1-4)  appears  to have a diﬀer- 
ent tissue expression  proﬁle as well as a separate  N-terminal  regulatory  
area, implying  that each isoform  could be targeted  independently  with a 
small molecule  or biologic  [ 99 , 100 ]. Though  PDE11A  inhibitors  and ac- 
tivators  have been identiﬁed  so far, more examinations  in patient tissue 
must yet be performed  for the establishment  of a therapeutic  indication  
[99] . 
5. Discussion  
5.1. A practical  and eﬃcient  system for the extension  of mechanism  KGs 
By utilizing  AI-based  relationship  extraction  workﬂows,  we demon-  
strate that regular  updating  of highly curated  KGs is feasible.  The 
relationship-extraction  workﬂow  Sherpa is an open-source  and freely 
accessible  platform  that combines  diﬀerent  machine  learning  and NLP 
techniques  to enhance  biomedical  text analysis  procedures.  Initially,  the 
corpus for KG extension  was extracted  by searching  PubMed  for research  
abstracts  involving  Tau phosphorylation.  Then, the NLP-based  module  
performed  NER, NED and RE on this extension  corpus to identify  all BEL 
relationships  embedded  within.  As a ﬁnal step, manual  assessment  was 
performed  based on deﬁned  BEL evaluation  guidelines  to assess and re- 
ﬁne the extracted  BEL triples for further integration  in the initial KG. 
In our example  scenario  that is highly relevant  for drug repurposing  in 
neurodegenerative  diseases,  the subsequent  analysis  of the updated  KG 
revealed  previously  unreported  interactors  related to the modulation  
of Tau phosphorylation.  While the results of our overall approach  are 
promising,  we acknowledge  that substantial  work is needed  to improve  
the eﬃcacy  of the underlying  NLP-based  module.  Though  the develop-  
ment of complete  autonomous  systems  for extraction  of cause-and-eﬀect  
triples is a complex  task for which there is no near-optimal  prediction  
model yet. 
5.2. Principal  ﬁndings  achieved  by the BERT-based  NLP pipeline  
At the core of Sherpa NLP workﬂow  stands the Entity-Fishing  tool, a 
machine  learning  service that aims to automate  entity recognition  and 
disambiguation  generically  while minimizing  domain-speciﬁc  restric- 
tions. To perform  entity disambiguation,  a supervised  machine  learning  
technique  based on Random  Forest and Gradient  Tree Boosting  exploit-  
ing multiple  features  was utilized.  The Sherpa pipeline  includes  an open- 
source and extensible  tool named OpeNRE,  which provides  a framework  
for the implementation  of neural models for RE based on TensorFlow  
and PyTorch,  and is trained  with a BERT-based  encoder.  The perfor- 
mance and error analysis  revealed  the success  of the BERT-based  BEL 
triple extraction  module  in the rapid expansion  of the Tau KG. By mining 
the updated  KG, our investigations  and enrichment  analysis  yielded  six 
potential  target candidates  relevant  to the regulation  of Tau phosphory-  
lation concerning  neurodegenerative  diseases.  However,  additional  bio- 
logical screening  systems  are undoubtedly  required  to learn more about 
the role of these interactors  in modulation  of Tau phosphorylation  in 
the context  of AD. 
5.3. Hypothesis  generation  and validation  of identiﬁed  regulators  
For identifying  the novel upstream  regulators  of pTau, we applied  
a graph-based  algorithm  using BiKMi, an in-house  software  package  
which was designed  to explore  pathways  and interactions  within a 
BEL network.  Currently,  there is an ongoing  demand  for ML-based  ap- 
proaches  to improve  not only the hypothesis  generation  itself, but also 
the speed at which it is performed.  For instance,  the path ranking  algo- 
rithm (PRA) is an alternative  that can help with knowledge  reasoning  
and knowledge  recommendation  tasks [101] . PRA computes  the feature 
matrix on a pair of graph nodes and edges and assigns a score to each triple. As the KG representations  are used to predict links that may in- 
dicate potential  relations  between  entities  in the KG, hypothesis  gener- 
ation approaches  can be inﬂuenced  by a variety of factors,  such as how 
well the KG is constructed  or how well the KGE algorithm  works. In this 
regard, Zeng et al. [102] provided  a review of hypothesis  generation  ap- 
proaches  for drug discovery  using KGs and explain  that designing  and 
validating  automated  workﬂows  which can generate  hypotheses,  is still 
a massive  challenge  in the biomedical  domain.  Our work aims to meet 
this challenge  and present  a viable method  to overcome  the hurdles  of 
hypothesis  generation.  
To validate  and enrich our understanding  of the found interactor  can- 
didates,  we searched  a variety of gene, protein,  and disease  databases  
for additional  information.  By comparing  proteins,  protein  families,  and 
protein-protein  interaction  networks,  one can generate  a wealth of in- 
formation  about the relationship  between  proteins  within a genome  or 
across diﬀerent  species and related to diﬀerent  diseases.  Additionally,  
human disease  databases  are also an essential  component  of biological  
research  that aid in understanding  the importance  and context  of these 
proteins.  Among  the identiﬁed  interactors  described  in the results sec- 
tion, a major allelic variant of ApoE gene, ApoE 𝜀 4, is likely the most 
well-known  risk factor for late onset AD [95] . However,  it is unclear  
whether  ApoE 𝜀 4 is linked to increased  tau phosphorylation  and neu- 
roﬁbrillary  tangle development,  both of which are markers  of AD and 
cause structural  changes  in the neuronal  cytoskeleton  [103] . Interest-  
ingly, Zhou et al. investigated  genotype-speciﬁc  eﬀect of ApoE on tau 
phosphorylation  in mice and found that the ApoE 𝜀 4 genotype  increases  
this type of phosphorylation  via the calpain-CDK5  signaling  pathway  
[103] . Following  the fact that modulations  of ApoE are related to and 
promising  in AD drug development,  Ymazaki  et al. [95] summarized  
the associated  therapies  in three main categories:  1) regulation  of ApoE 
quantity;  2) modiﬁcation  of ApoE properties;  and 3) indirect  therapeutic  
approaches.  Despite  extensive  research  conducted  regarding  the role of 
ApoE in neurodegeneration,  no therapeutic  interventions  has been suc- 
cessfully  found that targets the ApoE gene directly  [95] . This could be 
due to the complicacy  of mechanisms  underlying  ApoE isoform-speciﬁc  
diﬀerences  on brain homeostasis  [95] . However,  though ApoE is not di- 
rectly targeted,  the ApoE genotype  is expected  to aﬀect the responses  in 
several potential  AD therapies  [95] . 
5.4. Corpora  generation  and possible  improvement  strategies  
Despite  the eﬃciency  of the RE module,  more thorough  evaluations  
and adaptations  of our workﬂow  are still required  to further improve  
performance.  One area that can be revised  in our proposed  methodol-  
ogy is the strategy  for searching  for relevant  abstracts  and publications.  
As stated previously,  we used speciﬁc  keywords  and looked through  
PubMed  database  via their API, however,  even with a sophisticated  
search phrase,  querying  PubMed  may not always return pertinent  ar- 
ticles in their entirety  [104] . To improve  the search strategy,  Subra- 
manian  et al. [104] introduced  a shallow  ﬁltering  approach  to retrieve  
relevant  literature  in the context  of drug repurposing.  Previously,  this 
matter was also investigated,  and a systematic  methodology  was intro- 
duced to develop  better strategies  and enhance  biomedical  literature  
searching  [105] . Moreover,  there are now alternative  platforms  such as 
A2A [106] which support  searching  through  biomedical  publications.  
Such tools will also be considered  in our future investigations  toward 
more eﬃcient  context-speciﬁc  corpora  generation  [106] . 
5.5. Model optimization  strategies  for an enhanced  BEL relation  extraction  
Training  deep learning  models for BEL triple extraction  is diﬃcult  
due to the small amount  of BEL training  data available.  One way to al- 
leviate this and allow for a more easily generated  annotated  dataset,  
would be the use of distant supervision  techniques  [107] . Distant  su- 
pervision,  also known as weak supervision,  can help with generating  
7 N.S. Babaiha, H. Elsayed, B. Zhang et al. Artiﬁcial Intelligence in the Life Sciences 4 (2023) 100078 
labeled  datasets,  though these labels may also contain  noise [108] . In- 
terestingly,  active learning  approaches  have recently  been shown to re- 
duce the labeling  eﬀort required  for learning  a RE model. This is accom-  
plished  by incorporating  a human annotator  into the learning  loop and 
carefully  selecting  a small number  of samples  to be labeled  [109] . Ac- 
tive learning  methodologies  are especially  useful when there are plenty 
of unlabeled,  available,  and easy-to-access  samples,  but labeled  data is 
rare and costly to provide  [110] . As instance,  in their work, Rosales  et al. 
[111] used active learning  to extract and classify  clinical  concepts.  Ide- 
ally, we would in the future design and utilize an active learning  frame- 
work combined  with weak supervision  to maximize  the BEL triple ex- 
traction  performance  by minimizing  the number  of samples  that require  
domain-expert  manual  BEL annotation.  
Another  possible  solution  for improving  RE performance  would be to 
combine  the co-occurrence-based  strategies  in our pipeline.  In a recent 
study, a scoring  method  was previously  proposed  that relies on entity co- 
occurrences  to extract relationships  from biomedical  literature  [112] . In 
their work, they considered  how often two entities  appear together  and 
aggregated  these counts over the whole corpus [112] . Co-occurrence  
based RE approaches  are very advantageous  since they do require  an- 
notated  training  yet maintain  a relatively  high recall rate. In our future 
work, we will implement  these strategies  to enhance  our platform  and 
overcome  its limitations.  
6. Conclusion  
This work demonstrated  the feasibility  of an NLP-based  pipeline  for 
the semi-automated  updating  of a highly curated  KG. Our strategy  is 
based on a pragmatic  approach  to rapidly  generate  biomedical  corpora  
enriched  with recent publications  which are then fed into an NLP work- 
ﬂow for BEL statement  detection.  Despite  the eﬃciency  of our pipeline,  
clearly there is a demand  for accelerated  manual  BEL annotation  as well 
as an expansion  of training  datasets  for NLP workﬂow  improvement.  
We obviously  did not solve the problem  of full automation  of the KG 
updating  process.  However,  we foresee that soon complete  triple indices 
will be available  for entire PubMed  (including  related full-text  literature  
collections).  This will make ﬁnding  “related  ”and “recent  ”triples  merely 
a graph query task. We are currently  working  on such “triple index ”for 
entire indication  areas and it is only a matter of time before we will see 
the ﬁrst PubMed-wide  cause-and-eﬀect  indices.  
Moreover,  the breathtaking  dynamics  we currently  observe  in the 
ﬁeld of large language  models (LLMs) open new perspectives  for the 
interplay  between  LLMs and knowledge  graphs and we are looking  for- 
ward to the ﬁrst BART or ChatGPT  plugins  that support  the updating  
of knowledge  graphs.  The work here sheds a spotlight  on the challenge  
of updating  knowledge  graphs;  however,  it needs to be seen as part of 
a much broader  development  in the ﬁeld of language,  knowledge  and 
their utility.
