Orthogonal ABSTRACT  
In this article, we focus on the hybrid of orthogonal and non-orthogonal broadcasting. The hybrid configuration 
is raised and proposed for improving cellular digital television broadcasting (CDTB) technology. The hybrid 
scheme is configured as layered division multiplexing (LDM) multiplexed with an evolved multimedia broadcast 
multicast service (eMBMS) standalone layer is superimposed. The LDM and eMBMS are sub-sections of power 
division-non orthogonal multiple access (PD-NOMA) and long-term evolution (LTE) respectively. We assume 
perfect knowledge of the channel state information (CSI) over the Rayleigh fading multipath channel. The bit 
error rate (BER) and outage probability performance criteria are investigated. The impact of injection level using 
the fractional transmit power allocation (FTPA) algorithm is discussed. The proposed hybrid can operate in 
conditions without a subscriber identity module (SIM) card for uplink beamforming and internet protocol (IP). 
The broadcast network provider selection is feasible by the user equipment (UE) device. Performance analysis is 
derived based on the exact closed-form expressions, which allows the theory of hybrid proposed LDM/eMBMS 
consistent with results. Evaluations and performance will be done based on the Monte Carlo iterative method -
ology. The results show that the performance and efficiency will be increased when a proposed hybrid LDM/ 
eMBMS configuration is compared with LDM and eMBMS services individually.   
1.Introduction 
After 5G and beyond (B5G) cellular technology, the trend towards 
hybrid cellular digital television broadcasting (CDTB) are increased. The 
cellular hybrid configuration realizes user coverage fairness, low la-
tency, massive connectivity, spectral efficiency, compatibility, and 
selectivity in radio access methods [1–3]. There was created a gap be-
tween the digital terrestrial television broadcasting (DTTB) versus CDTB 
in terms of service-layers technology selection [4]. The history of the 
physical layer of cellular broadband infrastructure generations shows 
that is changed and shifted approximately once every decade for 
instance 4G to 5G. While the television broadcast has changed over time, 
for instance in analog television (ATV) to digital television (DTV) tran-
sition the national television system committee (NTSC-3.58) converted 
to advanced television system committee (ATSC) standard in USA or 
phase alternation line (PAL) converted to digital video 
broadcasting-terrestrial (DVB-T) in Europe and NTSC-J converted to 
integrated service digital broadcast (ISDB) in Japan [5,6]. Besides, there 
is an approach to broadcasting between broadcast owners to supply and deploy live video transmission among point to multipoint (PTM) and 
streaming delivery services [7]. 
Moreover, restrictions are imposed by the international telecom -
munication union (ITU) to reduce broadcast bandwidth and increase 
broadband bandwidth that is named digital dividend, and the coexis -
tence of broadcast and broadband in the ultra-high frequency (UHF) 
spectrum is regulated by local radio frequency organization policy im-
plications [8]. 
There is a challenge in historical inconsistency for operators to 
synchronize with different technologies. There are incompatibility and 
contradictions in DTTB infrastructure versus CDTB technology. For 
instance era of wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA) in 
broadband versus digital video broadcasting-handheld (DVB-H) in 
broadcast technology initially [9–11]. 
To address these challenges broadcast holders and broadcast owners 
are suggested a juxtaposition approach [12]. The subject will offer a set 
of challenges and opportunities for CDTB recipients and broadcast ser-
vice providers (BSPs) [13]. Nowadays, BSPs looking to pick out an 
alternative to next-generation platform CDTB technology using existing

2structures gap physical layers [14]. They are emerged as a possible so-
lution to have hybrid technology using a multi-layer delivery system 
recommended by researchers in the last few years [15]. To develop the 
provide technologies that can satisfy such mandates, the convergence 
broadcast and broadband and hybrid broadcast and broadband (HBB) 
are being researched and developed as a kind of integration methods 
worldwide for decades [12,16,17]. 
Furthermore, great advancements are achieved in terms of integra -
tion technologies such as using the Long Term Evolution-broadcast 
(LTE-B) and power division-non orthogonal multiple access (PD- 
NOMA) simultaneously [18]. 
The LTE-B introduced evolved Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Ser-
vices (eMBMS) as an orthogonal and PD-NOMA introduced layered di-
vision multiplexing (LDM) as non-orthogonal service providers [19,20]. 
The eMBMS operates as a PTM intermediary live big-data transmission. 
The technology is expected to play a significant role in reducing the 
loading of delivering multimedia streaming for future cellular broad -
casting. Also, the technology will support geographic positioning in-
formation updates such as local news, climate and traffic reports, stocks 
value and exchange, telemedicine, video conference, mobile TV, and 
related services [7,21–23]. 
In recent years studies of the 3rd Generation Partnership Project 
(3GPP) TV Enhancements (EnTV) have suggested a further evolved 
MBMS (FeMBMS), known as 5G broadcast, and it is based on 4G LTE. 
Authors in Ref. [24] enhanced the FeMBMS feature is flexibility in ca-
pacity, which it can allocate up to 100% sub-frames to broadcast mode 
in Rel-14, while formerly, up to 60% sub-frames and 40% sub-frames to 
broadcast and unicast mode have been allocated in the eMBMS Rel-13 
respectively [25–28]. The LDM is a sub-section of PD-NOMA, which is 
a form of physical-layer non-orthogonal that uses the available spectrum 
resource blocks (RBs) by assigning a different power value to each user. 
The infrastructure of LDM technology is based on two layers namely, the 
upper layer (UL) and the lower layer (LL) [29–31]. It can serve as a 
platform for both mobile and stationary services, which is used in the 
future digital TV standard within 3GPP LTE 5G new radio (NR) releases 
15,16,17 for next cellular broadcasting [32]. Also, LDM can achieve 
high spectrum performance when multiplexing various services (indoor, 
handheld, mobile, stationary) with different requirements and data rate 
throughputs standard-definition television (SDTV), high definition 
television (HDTV), 4k, 8k, surround audio using the same spectrum 
resource [29]. The LDM has the ability operates to transmit high data 
rates fixed service on LDM-LL and low data rates mobile service on 
LDM-UL as non-orthogonality [23,33,34].

both unicast and broadcast systems are optimally used in a hybrid 
model. Lykougiotis et al. Chen et al. [43] proposed to incorporate 
multicast and unicast services into cellular networks using a 
non-orthogonal transmission configuration based on the LDM in cellular 
networks. Zhao et al. [44] analyzed the performance gain of LDM over 
time division and frequency division multiplexing (TDM/FDM) as a 
potential NOMA approach for simultaneous transmission of broadcast 
and unicast messages over cellular networks. Boronat et al. [45] intro-
duced the concept of hybrid TV media services and media sync is 
illustrated. L. Zhang et al. [46] characterized and optimized cellular 
service transfer in LDM-based future generation DTV systems. Christo -
doulou et al. [21] presented an LTE hybrid unicast broadcast content 
delivery configuration. Guo et al. [23] optimized hybrid uni-
cast/multicast live video streaming configuration over MBMS-enabled 
technology. Fang et al. [47] optimized the energy efficiency of 
resource scheduling for NOMA compares with orthogonal multiple ac-
cess (OMA) using the DC programming method. Park et al. [48] 
implemented field laboratory test LDM for DTV systems. Table 2 sum-
marizes important studies in the literature in association with hybrid 
broadcast and broadband technology. 
We mentioned at the beginning that in addition to the challenges, 
there is an opportunity in terms of orthogonal and non-orthogonality. 
Hence, our interest in this paper is considered on hybrid orthogonal 
and non-orthogonal multi-layers networks [38]. Eventually, in this 
paper, to gain victory over the mentioned drawbacks and opportunities. 
The cellular hybrid LDM/eMBMS configuration is illustrated as an in-
termediate method for overcoming the changes in the physical structure 
gap of mobile and broadcast systems, which has been studied in terms of 
technology service-layers [49]. 
Fig. 1 illustrates a simplified schematic proposed configuration. A 
transmitter and receiver downlink cellular single-cell next-generation 
base station (gNB). A single input single output (SISO) downlink trans -
mission is broadcasting. The LDM non-orthogonal and the eMBMS 
orthogonal signals are superimposed on the different frequency archi -
tecture [34]. 
In our scenario assumed, there are three BSPs in a single cell, namely, 
BSP1, BSP2, and BSP3 are superimposed that is based on power level for 
the LDM-LL, LDM-UL, and eMBMS services in a cellular single-tier 
respectively. The LDM-LL broadcasts fix service high data rate and 
LDM-UL and eMBMS mobile broadcasts mobile service low data rate in a 
channel simultaneously. The BSP1 and BSP2 work in the same radio 
frequency and BSP3 has a different frequency. The GLL, GUL, GeMBMS 
denotes channel gains from the gNB station for LL near user and UL far 
user and eMBMS middle user respectively. The LDM signal carries two 
users per sub-carrier, while eMBMS carries a single user per sub-carrier 
simultaneously in a channel [50]. 
The LL is a near user with strong received signal and lower power 
transmission and higher channel gain factor from the gNB station, which 
has a high-level modulation and larger signal constellation for carrying 
stationary service. The UL is a far user with weak received signal and 
higher power transmission has a lower channel gain factor from the gNB 
station, which has a low-level modulation and smaller signal constel -
lation for carrying mobile service. The eMBMS is a middle user with 
average power transmission signal reception has a medium channel gain 
factor from the gNB base station, which has a high-level modulation and 
larger signal constellation for carrying mobile service. The LL signal user 
is modulated as a quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) and the UL 
signal is modulated as a binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) and the 
eMBMS signal user modulated as a QPSK in our configuration [36,37].

4● There is the convenience of choosing a BSPs for the UDs.  
● The proposed system is performed based on closed-form exact BER 
and outage performance statements over a multi-path downlink 
Rayleigh fading channel.  
● It is possible improving BER performance for the LDM-UL by using 
varying injection level factors instead of fixed ones to achieve multi- 
service multi-rate programs from SDTV up to Ultra-HDTV.  
● Due to the feature of broadcasting, the proposed broadcast system 
downlink will be able to operate without a subscriber identity 
module (SIM card) uplink and internet protocol (IP) in times of crisis. 
2.Proposed system description 
In this section, first, the proposed model description is presented and 
then followed by the basic mathematical formulation theory in sub- 
sections. 2.1. System model 
In this subsection, The power-domain downlink hybrid non- 
orthogonal/orthogonal LDM/eMBMS cellular system model will be 
introduced. The gNB station, which has an M RB, includes K sub-carriers 
and U users. We have two group users, called LDM users and eMBMS 
users. Furthermore, we have two group RBs, the LDM, and the eMBMS. 
The number of LDM RBs denoted with Ψ, and the number of eMBMS RBs 
denoted with Ω. Each RB includes Km consecutive sub-carriers. The BS 
and UDs are equipped with SISO antennas. Fig. 2 describes and extends 
the system model in three sub-figures transmitter-receiver and fre-
quency RBs spectrum as a,b,c. 
On the transmission side Fig. 2.a the data generated in two-source, 
eMBMS, and LDM. So, the LDM has two source layers. In the UL, data 
pass through the bit interleaved coding modulation (BICM) processes. 
Meanwhile, the LL data pass from the BICM process too, then the 
resultant LL signal is multiplied by, ⎪⎪⎪g♠, injection power level factor. In 
the end, output signals of two layers are superposed together in the 
power domain [51]. Afterward, the LDM output coefficients power 
layers are normalized to one. The LDM two layers multiplied by,

, in the entrance of the multiplexer. Thereby, the eMBMS part 
passes from the BICM and multiplexed with the LDM part. The result is 
generated total transmitting signal. As seen in Eq. (1), the ultimate 
signal is converted from serial to parallel, after that, both combination 
LDM and eMBMS signals are subcarrier-mapped. The mapped signal 
passes into the Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT). 
IFFT converts the signal from the frequency to the time domain. The 
guard interval is provided by the cyclic prefix (CP), which CP removes 
the inter symbol interference (ISI) from the previous symbol. Then the 
signal is converted from digital to analog and it can be up-converted into 
a radio frequency (RF) ultra-high-frequency band. The signal passes 
through the multi-path Rayleigh fading wireless channel. The Rayleigh 
fading channel is suitable for describing wireless channels in densely 
high power high tower (HPHT) broadcasting populated urban centers 
[34,52]. 
On the reception side Fig. 2.b, is shown that the radio frequency is 
down-converted and CP is removed [53] from the received signal. The 
FFT converts the signal from the time domain to the frequency domain 
and the signal is demodulated. The limitations of the superimposed 
signal by estimation and equalization block are solved. The LDM signal 
carries two users per sub-carrier and eMBMS carries a single user Table 3

5simultaneously in a channel [50]. Then de-normalized power for LDM 
and de-multiplexed composed signal. The LDM signal is demodulated 
using successive interference cancellation (SIC) two layers. The SIC 
decoding instruction is based on the ordered channel gain (G) infor-
mation.Finally in signal decoding the eMBMS signal will be decoded 
using the regular receiver [54] that hybrid receiving configuration is 
shown in Figs. 1 and 2. 
The SIC block in the receiver part is explained as follows, the strong 
user UL signal which is far from gNB station is decoded by treating the LL 
signal as interference. Because the strong signal has the lowest inter-
ference and attempts in coherent decoding without SIC perform. Then 
UL signal is subtracted from the main composite signal if the UL signal is 
decoded successfully. Afterward, LL signal near user which has high 
interference and low power, is decoded with performing SIC. Also, the 
eMBMS signal is de-multiplexed and decoded by a normal user receiver, 
because we used multiplexing in the transmitter. At the end of this sub- 
section, for more interpretation and complete theoretical description of 
the block diagram the hybrid LDM/eMBMS proposed system model in 
the frequency domain Fig. 2.c is illustrated. 2.2. Problem formulation 
Assume there are M RBs and at the mth RB there are Km sub-carriers. 
The number of LDM and eMBMS RBs are Ψ and Ω, respectively. If all the 
RBs are occupied with LDM and eMBMS data than the total number of 
RBs can be written in terms of Ψ and Ω as follows M Ψ Ω. So the kth 
sub-carrier mapping of the LDM or eMBMS symbol to the mth RB can be

αm 1 while βm 0 and to select eMBMS symbol βm 1 while αm 0.

allocation, XLDMCmk, is the summation of UL symbol XULCmkand LL

this paper, we assume that these transmit powers do not change sub- 
carrier to sub-carrier and RB to RB, so we will drop sub-carrier and RB 
indices. Therefore, the superposed transmit LDM symbol can be written 
as follows,

So in an LDM RB, there can be two users. And for eMBMS RB, only 
one user can be allocated. LL sub-carriers power is changed with an

3.Performance analysis 
In this section, the mathematical analysis in three sub-sections are 
followed as 1) The BER performance is investigated and analyzed. 2) 
Fractional Transmit Power Allocation (FTPA) algorithm for LDM multi- 
services is considered and analyzed. 3)The outage probability perfor -
mance is considered and analyzed. 
3.1. BER analysis 
In this sub-section, BER performance expressions for the UL and LL of 
the LDM part proposed hybrid system are obtained based on Kara and 
Kaya ’s derivations [36,37]. We investigated that in Refs. [36,37], their 
work considered a single carrier system and over a flat fading channel, 
our work considers to multicarrier so, some manipulations will be 
needed to obtain formulas that matched our multicarrier system and 
multipath Rayleigh channel assumption [49]. The error probability of 
the UL is as follows H. Shariatzadeh et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Array 11 (2021) 100073

3.2. FTPA Algorithm for LDM multi-services 
Due to its low computational complexity, FTPA is widely adopted in 
OFDMA and PD-NOMA systems [47,58 ]. In the FTPA, the transmit 
power of LDM RBs on sub-carrier kth (SCk) is allocated according to the 
channel gains of all the multiplexed users on SCk, which is given as 
follows

where ξ in Eq. (37) 0≼ξ≼1is a decay factor and in the case ξ 0, it 
corresponds same power between allocated users. The FTPA algorithm is 
based on the idea that allocating more power to the poorer average 
channel response coefficient when ξ increases. 
Here we select it as ξ 0.4. In Tables 4 and 5 power allocation values 
calculated by FTPA with different average channel coefficients of 
E⏟
HUL2⇑
 3C 5C 7dB are given. However, in Table 4, fixed power 
allocation values, PLL 0.4 and PUL 0.6 are given as without FTPA. In 
section 4, from Figs. 5 and 6, we will seen that fixed power allocation 
values are fit for  7 dB average channel coefficient powers value. For 
other average channel coefficient powers values, BER performance is 
getting worse compare to the with FTPA case. Moreover, using FTPA has 
an impact on UL BER performance and obviously on LDM. Since FTPA 
has no gain on LL BER performance, the effect on LDM is not as clearly 
visible as UL BER performance. 
3.3. Outage analysis 
Generally, outage probability performance is a relevant criterion for 
the assessment of the quality of service. It measures the probability of 
failing to achieve an output SNR threshold value required for the desired 
service outage probability is defined as the probability that the instan -
taneous sum rate falls below a certain pre-determined threshold value, i. 
e., R0 [59–61]. 
Since the proposed system is a multi-carrier system consisting of the 
LDM and the eMBMS parts, we can write the outage probability as sub- 
carrier based and the summations of LDM and eMBMS sub-carriers 
outage probabilities as shown in the following equation.

4.Simulation results 
In the simulation results section, iterative Monte Carlo simulation 
results will be present to evaluate the performance of the proposed non- 
orthogonal/orthogonal LDM/eMBMS system based on RBs per sub- 
carrier spectrum. Simulation parameters are given in Table 3. Simula -
tion results presented in three main parts 1) The BER performance 
illustrated for LDM, eMBMS as individually, and hybrid non- 
orthogonal/orthogonal proposed configuration. 2) FTPA power alloca -
tion algorithm results for LDM is investigated 3) Outage probability 
performance for LDM, eMBMS as individually, and hybrid non- 
orthogonal/orthogonal proposed configuration will be shown. 
4.1. BER performance results 
As shown in Fig. 3 the LDM BER performance is depicted, while 
theoretical analysis is given in Eqs. (21), (26) and (36). As can be seen 
from the figure, the theoretical and simulation results completely 
matched. Furthermore, the LDM can support two users in each sub- 
carrier and thus can facilitate meeting the quality of multi-service re-
quirements. Since we use QPSK for LL near user and BPSK for UL far user 
modulations, the bits per symbol for both layers are bLL log24 2 and 
bUL log22 1, respectively. The UL user is far from BS compare to LL 
near, the near user has a better BER performance than the far user. So, 
we assume the average frequency domain channel coefficient for UL is 3 
dB lower than LL. To compensate for this issue, we adjust fixed Table 5

But still in the SNR to be 10 dB point and increase up to 24 dB, the LDM- 
LL outperforms BER performance than the LDM-UL. It is assumed an 
equal number of LDM and eMBMS RB allocations as Ω Ψ 8. 
Simulation results, as shown in Fig. 4 the BER performance of LDM 
and eMBMS with the hybrid proposed framework versus SNR(dB) is 
compared, which are derived in Eqs. (32) and (35) with LDM technol -
ogy. For a fair comparison, we assume normalized average frequency

0dB, and normalized transmit power for 
eMBMS users PeMBMS PLL PUL 1. We use QPSK modulation for 
eMBMS, the bits per symbol is beMBMS log24 2. Although we use SIC 
for LDM users, residual interference causes BER performance degrada -
tion, therefore from Fig. 4 it can be seen that the eMBMS performance 
outperforms the LDM and the proposed overall hybrid system perfor -
mance lays down in between. As expected, the hybrid proposed frame -
work simulation results are shown that the overall performance average 
has been located between LDM and eMBMS technologies individually. 
However, eMBMS can provide better performance since it can support 
single users, and consequently, the probability to satisfy the isolation 
constraint will increase in the edge of borders and the coverage region 
between BSPs. 
The BER performance of the proposed system is more than LDM and 
less than eMBMS compared to the other two technologies. As mentioned 
the proposed system BER Performance plot is placed lays down between 
LDM and eMBMS. 
4.2. FTPA algorithm results for LDM 
In this sub-section, we evaluate the impact of the FTPA algorithm on 
BER performance to achieve PLL and PUL power allocation for LDM 
layers, which is shown in Figs. 5 and 6. 
In Table 4 fixed power allocation values, PLL 0.4 and PUL 0.6 as 
without (w/o) FTPA are given. Also, in Table 5 power allocation values 
calculated with FTPA impact for different average channel coefficient of E⏟
HUL2⇑
 3C 5C 7dB are given. Hence, from Figs. 5 and 6 it can be 
seen the effect of the FTPA algorithm compared without FTPA out-
performs BER performance on both LDM and UL layer. From Fig. 5 it can 
be seen that fixed power allocation values match exactly in  7 dB 
channel coefficient power value. For other average channel coefficient 
values, BER performance is getting worse compare to with FTPA case. 
Moreover, using FTPA has an impact on UL BER performance and 
obviously on LDM. Since FTPA has no gain on LL BER performance, the 
effect on LDM is not as clearly visible as UL BER performance in Fig. 5. 
As shown in Fig. 6 the impact of the FTPA algorithm on BER per-
formance for LDM layers with different path losses are demonstrated. In 
our novel we assume LL to be set 0 dB, while LDM changes to be ( 3,  5, 
 7)d B, attenuation path loss (channel coefficient gain). In Fig. 6 we 
evaluate the BER performance of the LDM part with different attenua -
tion levels for the UL channel without and with the FTPA algorithm. We 
assume, that the user in the UL channel is far from the gNB station, and, 
therefore, path loss attenuation is high. When the UL is looking for 
different path losses ( 3,  5,  7)dB, the user in LL is kept to 0 dB. As 
can be seen from Fig. 6 the worst performance is a value of  7 dB, and  
3 dB is the best path loss for the LDM. The exact closed-form simulation 
and theoretical outperforms BER performance for the LDM compared 
with the UL channel. 
In Fig. 7 the simulation results for the proposed overall system with 
different numbers of eMBMS RBs allocation BER performance is illus-
trated. In this figure, in every scenario, the number of occupied RBs is 
the same and M 16, but the number of eMBMS RBs, Ω, are sequentially 
taken{0, 4, 8, 12, 16}and so the number of LDM RBs, Ψ, are taken {16, 
12, 8, 4, 0}. It can be easily seen that while increasing the number of 
eMBMS RBs, Ω. The proposed hybrid framework led to improved BER 
performance, on the contrary, decreasing the number of LDM RBs, Ψ, 
lead to the proposed hybrid system ’s BER performance. 
In Fig. 8. The BER performance of the proposed hybrid framework 
versus the number of eMBMS RBs (Ω) under fixed SNR equal 24 dB is 
shown. The number of eMBMS RBs (Ω) increased from 0 to 16 (the 
number of LDM RBs (Ψ) decreased from 16 to 0). The result shows that 
the overall performance increased with the number of eMBMS

11performance. So, compared with the eMBMS single-layer mobile system, 
the efficiency of the LDM has been increased. It can be seen from Fig. 9 
results, that the LDM outage probability performance outperforms the 
eMBMS technology. 
As illustrated in Fig. 10 LDM-LL, LDM-UL, and eMBMS technology outage probability performances are compared with the hybrid pro-
posed configuration. The LDM-LL near user has a better outage perfor -
mance than the far user LDM-UL. Also, eMBMS user outage performance 
is increased and match with LDM-LL exactly. The eMBMS layer outage 
performance outperforms compared with LDM-UL, while the LDM-UL

12outage performance decreased. where the eMBMS carries one user and 
LDM carries two users on the sub-carrier concurrently. Hence, it is 
increased the efficiency of the LDM two-layer system compared to the 
eMBMS single-layer mobile system and consequently, overall system 
performance is increased. As expected from Fig. 10. The hybrid 
configuration offers the median outage probability. This is due to the 
proposed hybrid configuration for improving the throughput rate (as 
mentioned we given outage performance based on sum rate in sub- 
section 3.3) and flexibility in the radio access selection. Hence, led to 
improved outage probability performance. This is one of our claims 
about combination hybrid configuration. 
5.Conclusion and future suggestions 
In this article, we have nominated a novelty approach for radio access that can dynamically select an appropriate technology among 
LDM and eMBMS based on the average CSI. This attitude is concentrated 
on a configuration for CDTB infrastructure technology. The issue sug-
gested a hybrid of orthogonal/non-orthogonal multi-radio layers 
broadcasting multiple services. We investigated the mathematical per-
formance of hybrid LDM/eMBMS versus the individual single-layer 
service provider. We studied the impact of three BSPs through single- 
cell downlink beamforming over the Rayleigh fading multipath chan-
nel for presenting mobile/stationary services. The system has two binary 
switches for radio access service selection. The service assignment bi-
nary switch has used two factors. These factors illustrated with αm and 
βm symbols. The BER performance in LDM and UL channel response gain 
investigated with FTPA algorithm. An exact closed-form BER and 
Outage rate performance are analyzed. The system can work without 
SIM card uplink way and IP for situation crises. MATLAB simulations 
shown that both theoretical expressions and plots are matched exactly. It 
is concluded from this research that non-orthogonal and orthogonal 
hybrid framework technology has outperformed BER and outage rate 
performance compared to a solitary technology. Therefore, we proposed 
that for next-generation CDTV as a middle infrastructure for broadcast 
network owners. In a special case, we recommend it for next-generation 
CDTB broadcast. 
The optimization problem of the system is one of the most important 
future directions to continue the work on the orthogonal and non- 
orthogonal hybrid configuration. We intend to optimize BER and sum- 
rate versus transmission power for the hybrid system. The stochastic 
geometric tool are used to study of random hybrid LDM/eMBMS tech-
nologies. Utilization of stochastic processes to achieve an optimal output 
for instance using the Poisson point process will analyze the hybrid 
configuration network.
