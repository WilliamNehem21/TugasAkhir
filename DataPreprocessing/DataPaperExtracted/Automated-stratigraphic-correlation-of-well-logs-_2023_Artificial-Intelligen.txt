The stratigraphic correlation of well logs plays an essential role in characterizing subsurface reservoirs.
However, it suffers from a small amount of training data and expensive computing time. In this work,
we propose the Attention Based Dense Network (ASDNet) for the stratigraphic correlation of well logs. To
implement the suggested model, we first employ the attention mechanism to the input well logs, which
can effectively generate the weighted well logs to serve for further feature extraction. Subsequently, the
DenseNet is utilized to achieve good feature reuse and avoid gradient vanishing. After model training, we
employ the ASDNet to the testing data set and evaluate its performance based on the well log data set
from Northwest China. Finally, the numerical results demonstrate that the suggested ASDNet provides higher
prediction accuracy for automated stratigraphic correlation of well logs than state-of-the-art contrastive UNet
and SegNet.
1. Introduction
Establishing the stratigraphic framework is a crucial technology
in geological interpretation ( Cross and Lessenger , 1988 ), which is
beneficial for reservoir estimation and geologic model building ( Fang
et al. , 2021 ). Stratigraphic correlation is a widely used approach to
provide information regarding stratigraphic and compartmentalization
in a reservoir. For the traditional process of seismic interpretation,
stratigraphic correlation is often obtained by geological interpreters,
which is time-consuming and heavily reliant on the expertise of the
interpreters ( Tokpanov et al. , 2020 ). To avoid the above problems,
automatic stratigraphic correlation approaches have been proposed,
employing computational algorithms and statistical methods to an-
alyze stratigraphic data from different locations and determine the
relative ages of rock layers or sedimentary deposits. Over the past
decades, many automatic stratigraphic correlation approaches have
been employed, such as the cross-correlation technique ( Southam and
Hay, 1978 ; Mann and Dowell , 1978 ), dynamic waveform matching
technique ( Smith and Waterman , 1980 ; Edwards et al. , 2018 ), dynamic
time warping ( Wheeler and Hale , 2014 ; Behdad , 2019 ) and its improve-
ments ( Grant et al. , 2018 ). These approaches mitigate the reliance on

tuning parameters to obtain a precise stratigraphic correlation result,
which is important but difficult to select.
Recently, with the rapid development of deep learning (DL), con-
volutional neural networks (CNNs) have attracted more researchers‚Äô
attention in seismic signal processing and interpretation ( Liu et al. ,
2021 ; Dong et al. , 2022 ; Lou et al. , 2022a ; Liu et al. , 2022c ), mainly
including seismic fault detection, seismic facies analysis, seismic noise
reduction, seismic inversion, etc. Generally, CNNs-based approaches
are also utilized in stratigraphic correlation. Maniar et al. (2018 )
proposed to use CNN and multilayer perceptron for semiautomatic
stratigraphic correlation. Zhang et al. (2019 ) suggested a CNN-aided
workflow to interpret a large amount of well-log data. Recently, more
and more state-of-the-art CNNs models are introduced for stratigraphic
division and correlation. For example, SegNet, which is stable to pro-
cess pixel-based data, has been adapted to correct stratigraphic ( Xu
et al. , 2019 ; Dai et al. , 2021 ). The Bidirectional Long Short-Term
Memory (BiLSTM) and the Inception autoencoder CNN are also applied
to interpret the log data and these two models are proved to be
effective for the stratigraphic interpretation ( Tokpanov et al. , 2020 ).
Generally, these DL-based stratigraphic correlation methods is a pixel

classification, which is similar to semantic segmentation. This is the
reason that several semantic segmentation-based models are utilized to
solve stratigraphic correlation issues ( Dai et al. , 2021 ; Wang and Chen ,
2023 ). Except for the model architecture, the loss function is another
key factor for the success of a CNN model. There are several excellent
loss functions proposed for solving different tasks ( Liu et al. , 2022b ,d;
Yang et al. , 2022 ), which have also been applied to address the accurate
stratigraphic correlation ( Tokpanov et al. , 2020 ; Liu et al. , 2022a ).
Among these state-of-the-art DL models, the densely connected
convolutional network (DenseNet) stands out with its intriguing con-
nectivity pattern, where each layer is connected to all the others within
a dense block ( Zhu and Newsam , 2017 ). The DenseNet is more compact
and is not easy to overfit. Furthermore, this architecture ensures that
each layer directly benefits from supervision by the loss function,
thereby facilitating deep supervision. Benefiting from these advantages,
the DenseNet has been adopted for addressing different issues, such
as medical data analysis ( Wang et al. , 2019 ; Zhang et al. , 2020a ),
landslide detection ( Cai et al. , 2021 ), image segmentation ( Zhang et al. ,
2023 , 2020b ), etc. In consideration of these advantages of DenseNet,
we suggest a DenseNet-based workflow for automated stratigraphic
correlation in this study, termed the Attention Based Dense Network
(ASDNet). Since the attention mechanism allows DL models to weigh
different parts of the input, which can be useful for interpreting how
the model is making its predictions, we introduce the Squeeze and
Excitation Block (SEBlock). Certainly, we first take different well logs of
a certain well as the multi-channel input of the suggested model. Next,
the SEBlock is utilized to calculate self-attention on the input channels,
which aim to weigh different well logs. Afterward, the dense blocks are
combined with convolutional layers to generate feature maps, which
are utilized to get the classification result of the input well. Afterward,
to test the effectiveness of the ASDNet, we apply it to the well log
data set for the automated stratigraphic correlation, which is located
at Ordos Basin, Northwest China.
2. Methodology
2.1. Dense convolutional network
To enhance the performance of convolutional neural networks,
deepening the network is frequently proposed and utilized. Rec-
ently, He et al. (2016 ) proposed the Residual Networks (ResNet), which
utilizes the identity connections to address the gradient vanishing
caused by network depth. Similar to ResNet, the Dense Convolutional
Network (DenseNet) is suggested to utilize the dense connection to
connect all layers directly with each other ( Huang et al. , 2019 ), which
contributes to better feature reuse and contains fewer parameters.
The Dense Block mainly consists of non-linear transformation and
Transition layers. As depicted in Fig. 1, the rectangular blocks indicate
both the inputs of each layer and the outputs of previous layers. It
is worth noting that we do not draw non-linear transformation andTransition layers in the figure, but instead use arrows to represent
them. Specifically, the output of the ùëñth layer can be written as
ùë•ùëñ=ùêπùëñ([ùë•0, ùë•1,‚Ä¶, ùë•i‚àí1]), (1)
where[ùë•0, ùë•1,‚Ä¶, ùë•i‚àí1]indicates the concatenation of the feature maps
computed in the preceding layers. 0,‚Ä¶, ùëñ‚àí 1.ùêπùëñ(‚ãÖ)refers to the non-
linear transformation of the ùëñth layer, which can be defined as a
combination of the batch normalization (BN), rectified linear unit
(ReLU), and 2D convolution (Conv). Moreover, the channel size of
ùë•ùëñisùëò, which is defined as the growth rate and means each layer
in the Dense Block produces ùëòfeature maps. The dense connections
shown in Eq. (1) make the information flow and gradients easy to
propagate while reducing the parameters. However, note that a dense
block may generate a staggering amount of feature maps. To solve this
problem, the Transition layer is introduced. The Transition layer is used
to connect the Dense Block and reduce the channels of feature maps by
utilizing a Conv with kernel size 1 √ó1. The above series of non-linear
transformations constitute a Dense Block. Note that, in this study, we
remove the max pooling operation in the traditional Transition layer to
lower the precision loss in downsampling, which would be explained
in the following sub-sections.
2.2. Squeeze and excitation block
To investigate the relationship between different channels, Hu et al.
(2018 ) proposed the Squeeze and Excitation Block (SEBlock). The
network can recalibrate the features with the aid of the SEBlock,
indicating that it can learn to strengthen informative features and
weaken redundant ones. As presented in Fig. 2, the SEBlock maps
the input ùëãto the refined feature maps ÃÉX, where X ‚ààRùê∂√óH√óWand
ÃÉX ‚ààRùê∂√óH√óW. Overall, the whole process of the SEBlock can be divided
into three parts: the squeeze, excitation, and scale. Given an input X,
it first utilizes squeeze operation ùêπùë†to produce aggregating feature
maps across spatial dimensions, where ùêπùë†can be defined as the global
average pooling or global max pooling. Next, the squeezed feature
maps via a simple gating mechanism ùêπùëícan be implemented by two
fully-connected (FC) layers, to get the weight of channel dimensions,
written as ùëÜùëê. Finally, the scale operation ùêπùë†ùëêutilizes the channel-wise
multiplication between ùëÜùëêandXto re-scale the input Xto the weighted
output ÃÉX.
2.3. ASDNet
Based on the substructures in the previous sub-sections, we propose
the Attention Based Dense network (ASDNet) for automated strati-
graphic correlation of well logs in this study. Fig. 3 shows the simplified
architecture and the corresponding detailed operations of the suggested
ASDNet.
Since the well logs of a single well can be regarded as a multi-
channel vector, we concatenate the well logs as the input. To make the
model simpler and make full use of CNN‚Äôs characteristics, we reshapeArtificial Intelligence in Geosciences 4 (2023) 128‚Äì136

the input multi-channel vector into a multi-channel matrix. Afterward,
we employ the mentioned SEBlock as a bypass to calculate the refined
feature maps of self-attention on the input channels, which aim to
weigh different well logs. Then, the refined feature maps are added to
the input via a connection-skipping operation. Here, we add a Conv
Block shown in Fig. 3 to increase the channel size so that it can be
directly applied to the following Dense Blocks. Here, to have a balance
between model parameters and computational efficiency, we set four
Dense Blocks. The combination of all these modules and the Dense
Blocks can generate reduced feature maps with abundant information.
Therefore, it should be noted that this part can also be interpreted as
an encoder.
The second half of the ASDNet can be regarded as a decoder. It starts
with four Conv Blocks to maintain the non-linear transformation while
downscaling the channel size of the reduced feature maps generated
by the encoder. Afterward, we apply two up-sampling layers followed
by the OutConv and reshape operation, which are utilized to map the
size of feature maps to the original well log length and get classifica-
tion results. Based on the above operations, we can get the accurate
stratigraphic correlation of corresponding well logs.
3. Numerical results
3.1. Study area and well logs
The study area is located in the Ordos Basin, Northwest of China,
indicated by the red ellipse in Fig. 4. This study area is located near the
western margin of the North China craton, which is proved to be a low
porosity and low permeability reservoir ( Wang et al. , 2015 ). Studies
have indicated that the Chang 7 member (i.e., the target interval) shows
complex and anisotropic stratigraphic characteristics, therefore, it is a
difficult task to accurately implement stratigraphic correlation of well
logs in this survey.
Fig. 5 presents the well map of the used well logs in this study.
There are a total of 176 wells in this seismic survey. Note that the

red and blue dots present the training and blind test wells, i.e., 88
wells and 88 wells, respectively. Here, the number of training wells is
given by experiments. We select borehole diameter (CAL), spontaneous
potential (SP), gamma ray (GR), acoustic (AC), and formation resistivity
(RT) as the training data in this study. Note that there are several
other commonly used well logs, such as density (DEN) and neutronArtificial Intelligence in Geosciences 4 (2023) 128‚Äì136

porosity (CNL). Due to the confidentiality agreement, we cannot obtain
more kinds of well logs, therefore, we do not implement the ablation
study about the sensitive well log selection in this work. It should be
noticed that sensitivity analysis of well logs is important for automated
stratigraphic correlation with the aid of deep learning.
3.2. Model training
All the DL models used in this study are created using Python 3.7
and the PyTorch deep learning library in version 1.11.0. Moreover, weimplement all the computations mentioned above on a server equipped
with a 36-core processor, 256 GB RAM, and NVIDIA GTX 3090 (24 GB
GPU memory). To balance the training effectiveness and convergence
rate, the models are each trained with a batch size of 16 and a maxi-
mum of 500 epochs. To be more specific, we use the Adam optimizer
with a learning rate of 0.0001 and a weight decay of 0.001. The other
hyperparameters of the Adam optimizer are set by default. In addition,
the loss function is set as the cross entropy loss in this work.
To train and validate the proposed ASDNet, the wells of the data
set are randomly divided into training wells and blind testing wells,Artificial Intelligence in Geosciences 4 (2023) 128‚Äì136

indicated in Fig. 5. After the fine-tuning training, the training loss curve
of training data is presented by the blue in Fig. 6. To more clearly
see how values are changing, we normalize the loss value in Fig. 6.
Obviously, the ASDNet is easy to converge and converges at around 400
epochs. After model training, we obtain an accurate and convergent
ASDNet.
3.3. Model evaluation
To evaluate the performance of ASDNet, we introduce several eval-
uation indicators to quantitatively test the effectiveness of the proposed
model, including the Accuracy (Acc) and confusion matrix. The Confu-
sion matrix summarizes the data set‚Äôs entries in the form of a matrix
based on the ground truth label and the prediction of the well-trained
model. The real value is represented by the row of the matrix, while
the predicted value is represented by the column of the matrix. Ta-
ble 1 denotes the confusion matrix of binary classification results and
multi-classification may be deduced by analogy.
3.4. Stratigraphic correlation results
After model training, we apply different models to the blind test-
ing data set for model validation and detailed comparison. We first
randomly select Well 37 (W37) to visualize the predicted result of
ASDNet. Moreover, to make equitable comparisons, we apply the samewell to other deep learning models, including UNet and SegNet. Note
that UNet and SegNet are two commonly used semantic segmentation-
based DL models, which have also been successfully used for addressing
geological issues ( Liu et al. , 2020 ; Birnie et al. , 2021 ; Meng et al. , 2021 ;
Gupta et al. , 2022 ; Lou et al. , 2022b ). Therefore, we adopt them as
the contrastive methods in this study. It should be noted that the UNet
and SegNet utilized in this work are standard implementations, which
both contain five layers for encoding and decoding. As indicated in
Fig. 7, the input of DL models is composed of five curves, which are
respectively (a) CAL, (b)GR, (c) SP, (d) AC, and (e) RT. The prediction
results of these deep learning models are shown in Fig. 7(g)‚Äì7(i), while
the ground truth labels are presented in Fig. 7(f). Comparing these
stratigraphic correlation results in Fig. 7, we can easily observe that
ASDNet achieves the most precise results, especially for label 1 (straw
yellow parts), while SegNet gets the worst results that cannot predict
label 1. Moreover, there are too many misinterpreted thin layers in
Fig. 7(i). Although the prediction results of ASDNet demonstrate its
superiority for automated stratigraphic correlation, its interpretation at
stratigraphic boundaries should be further enhanced.
Next, the confusion matrices of Well 37 are computed using (a) ASD-
Net, (b) UNet, and (c) SegNet and indicated in Fig. 8. Most of confusion
values in Fig. 8(a) are larger than those in Fig. 8(b) and 8(c). These
confusion matrices quantificationally demonstrate the superiority of the
suggested model over UNet and SegNet for automated stratigraphic
correlation.Artificial Intelligence in Geosciences 4 (2023) 128‚Äì136

Fig. 9. The accuracy of the total blind test data set computed using different deep learning models.
After the comparisons of W37, we then compare the overall perfor-
mance for the whole blind testing data set. Fig. 9 shows the accuracy of
the total blind test data set computed using different models. The hor-
izontal axis indicates the normalized accuracy, while the vertical axis
presents the well numbers. Obviously, the suggested ASDNet provides
stratigraphic correlation results of all well boreholes with an accuracy
higher than 0.7. Nevertheless, UNet and SegNet show apparently worse
results than ASDNet, even resulting in accuracy lower than 0.6. In
addition, the average accuracies of the whole blind testing data set are
calculated using different models and shown in Table 2. The suggested
ASDNet achieves about 3% and 4% accuracy enhancement over UNet
and SegNet. These quantitative comparisons in Fig. 9 and Table 2
further prove the availability and stableness of the suggested ASDNet
for automated stratigraphic correlation of well logs.
Finally, we present the automated stratigraphic correlation results
of multiple wells in Fig. 10, Fig. 11 and Fig. 12, respectively calculated
using UNet, SegNet, and ASDNet. The solid and dashed lines indicate
the ground truth and predicted stratigraphic correlation results forTable 2

W20, W42, and W49. Similar to the above discussions, the suggested
model apparently provides more accurate stratigraphic correlation re-
sults than the other two methods, especially at deep layers.
4. Discussion
Efficiency : Deep learning model inference times have a strong
connection with the network architecture. The model‚Äôs computational
complexity and inference speed are directly influenced by the network
structure‚Äôs design and the number of parameters. Since the proposed
ASDNet introduces the attention module, the total computing complex-
ity of the proposed model increases. Therefore, we decrease the numberArtificial Intelligence in Geosciences 4 (2023) 128‚Äì136

of up-sampling operations to lower the computing complexity and in-
formation loss. Moreover, we compare the training times and inference
time of ASDNet with other methods over the training and testing data
set, indicated in Table 3. It can be observed that the proposed ASDNet
just slightly increases the computation time compared with UNet.
Limitation : A deep learning model is suggested for implementing
automated stratigraphic correlation of well logs. Note that the sug-
gested ASDNet is actually a supervised model, indicating that we need
a large number of labeled data as training data and training labels.
These training labels are interpreted by experienced interpreters or
calculated using traditional methods, which is time-consuming and
laborious work. Moreover, the precision of training labels plays an im-
portant role in the success of a deep learning model. In future work, we
would like to introduce other state-of-the-art tools for determining the
confidence intervals of the automated stratigraphic correlation results.
Moreover, unsupervised models can also be utilized to solve automated
well log correlation issues, such as Gaussian mixture model-based
methods.
Future work : As discussed above, the stratigraphic correlation of
well logs is regarded as a segmentation task in this study. Therefore,
we suggested a segmentation model, i.e., the Attention Based Dense
Network (ASDNet), to enhance the performance of stratigraphic cor-
relation. Certainly, the suggested ASDNet can be easily transferred to
address other geological segmentation issues, such as horizon picking
and fault interpretation.5. Conclusion
In this study, we suggest an ASDNet model for automated strati-
graphic correlation of well logs, with the aid of the Dense Convolutional
Network (DenseNet) and the Squeeze and Excitation Block (SEBlock).
Specifically, the introduction of SEBlock and DenseNet can successfully
explore the relationship of different well logs while facilitating mean-
ingful feature reuse. The numerical examples prove that the SEBlock
can adequately model channel-wise feature dependencies. Moreover,
the DenseNet exhibits robust performance in extracting features from
the appropriately weighted well logs. The qualitative and quantitative
experiments finally demonstrate the superiority of the proposed ASD-
Net, which is superior to state-of-the-art semantic segmentation models,
i.e., UNet and SegNet.
