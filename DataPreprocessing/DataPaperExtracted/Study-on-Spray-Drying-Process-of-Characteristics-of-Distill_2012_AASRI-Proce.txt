China is a beer-producing country, and has been th e world's largest producer for many years (Dai and Zhang, 2010). Distillers' hops are one of beer-producin g waste, which isolated solids with heat-coagulum and hop-residue in whirlpool tanks (Liu, 2004). Distillers' hops were produced 1.5 ~ 4.0kg / t of raw materials (Zong et al., 2009). Each year more than 20 million tons of distillers' hops were produced. Distillers' hops are rich-nutrition, high water content, so can easily corru ption, and were greatly impact treatment and use.

 Spray drying is a very important industrial drying means (Liu et al., 2011). It has a very wide range of industrial applications, such as foods, medicines etc (Xiang et al., 2011). Advantages of spray-dried are drying quickly, large drying area, good product quality, less de struction of active ingredients, etc (Wang et al., 2011). In order to protect original nutrients and character istics of distillers' hops, yields and rehydration characteristics of distillers' hops samples with spray-dr ied were studied. New way of processing for distillers' hops was attempted to explore. 1. Materials and methods 1.1. Materials Distillers' hops, containing 33.78% protein, 5.37% fat, 20.85% crude fiber, 3.29% ash, and 36.71% other substances on dry basis, and 74.81% moisture, was obtained from China Resources Snow Breweries (Zigong) Co,. Ltd. Distillers' hops with four times water were homogeneous (10000r/min, 10min, T18, IKA Co., Ltd. Germany), then were centrifuge (4000r/min, 10 min, U-3010, Hitachi High-Technologies Corporation, Japan), the precipitations were keep for use. 1.2. Rehydration rate of spray-dried samples Centrifuge tubes (2.5ml) were dried, weighed, and labeled. 1.000g sample and 2mL water were added in tubes, were vortex (5min, Vortex-Genie 2, Scientific Industries Co., Ltd. USA), then were centrifuge (5000r/min, 10 min). The precipitations were weighed and calculated rehydration rate (Zeng et al., 2007).

Yield of spray-dried samples Weights of distillers' hop that before and after spray drying were measured. Moistures of distillers' hop that before and after spray drying were also measured. Then yields of spray-dried samples of distillers' hop were calculated (Chen et al., 2010).

Spray drying process The distillers' hops was taken to a laboratorial spra y dryer BUCHI, B-290. Feed temperature of 70 ~ 80
, 95% of fan powers, fluid flow rate of 0.25L/h are set according to the results of single factor experiment (data not shown). Inlet temperatures, outlet temperatures, sample concentrations were varied in accordance with the levels defined at the experimental design. 168   Li Li et al.  /  AASRI Procedia   3  ( 2012 )  166 – 171 
 1.5. Orthogonal designs Three factors that were feed concentration, inlet te mperature, and outlet temperature and four levels of every factors were selected according to the results of single factor experiment (data not shown), were constructed orthogonal test L
16 (45), and targets were rehydration rates and yields of spray-dried samples. Experiment schemes of orthogonal designs were listed in table 1.

 From range analysis results table 2, we can obtain th at the orders of every factor affect yield and rehydration rate are Inlet Temperature>Outlet Temperature>Feed Concentration. The optimal conditions of yield and rehydration rate are that inlet temperature are 160
, outlet temperature are 85 , feed concentration are 3.5g/200mL. 2.2. Established mathematical models Using DPS (Data Processing System), test data we re analyzed with quadratic polynomial stepwise regression. The mathematical models were established. The process conditions were optimized. The mathematical models of the relationship between yield an d rehydration rate with the various factors are as follows:  Y1 = -62.125 + 3.140* (X1-140) + 6.686* (X2-70) + 54.710* (X3-2) - 7.193E(-2)* (X1-140)* (X1-140) 
 0.2373* (X2-70)* (X2-70) 
 19.420* (X3-2)* (X3-2)  (1) (R=0.9869, F=42.7466, p=0.0001) Y2 = -230.702 + 11.938* (X1-140) + 23.231* (X2-70) + 193.392* (X3-2) -0.2629* (X1-140)* (X1-140) 
 0.8465* (X2-70)* (X2-70) 
 71.628* (X3-2)* (X3-2)  1.190E(-5)* (X1-140)* (X2-70) (2) (R=0.9993, F=835.3309, p=0.0001) Where Y1 is yield of samples, while Y2 is rehy dration rate, X1 is inlet temperature, X2 is outlet temperature, and X3 is feed concentration. Analysis of the two mathematical models showed that the two equations are lack of interaction terms or the coefficient interaction terms are extremely small. It ca n be seen from analysis of variance for the two regression equation, that the contribution of all interaction terms are very small to the regression model and were to be removed (Liu et al., 2010). The mathematical models are different with the single-factor test results. The reason may be that the interaction of factors make the optimal level offset, or beca use of the number of trials is less than normal (Luo et al., 2012). 170   Li Li et al.  /  AASRI Procedia   3  ( 2012 )  166 – 171 
 2.3. Analysis of response surfaces Response surfaces were drawn according to the two mathematical models, were shown in Figure 1. 
 
 
Figure 1 Response surfaces of yield and rehydration rate 
It can be seen from the degree of bending of the surf ace in Figure 1. When one of the factors was fixed, Yield and Rehydration rate will increase and then redu ce with another factor increases. The interactions between factors are not significant. Inlet Temperature has significant performance on Yield and Rehydration rate for the most surface steepest. The impact of Outlet Temperature is followed with Inlet Temperature. Feed Concentration has significant performance on the Yield an d Rehydration rate, but slightly lower than the other two factors. 2.4. Optimization of Process Conditions From the response surface we can see, maximum point s are in the range of experimental design. Partial derivatives of independent variables in the model equations are calculated, respectively . Set them to zero, then the extremum condition will get. X1=161.828, X2=84.087, X3=3.409, Y1=57.765 X1=162.703, X2=83.722, X3=3.350, Y2=194.745 It can be seen from the results of optimization, that the optimal conditions for product yields and rehydration rates are not the same levels. This shows that the best conditions for product recovery are not necessarily the optimal conditions of characteristics, an d there are gaps between different characteristics of optimal conditions.  In this experiment, the gaps of optimal conditions for product yields and rehydration rates are not too much. And to facilitate operation, verification conditio ns were selected Inlet temperature are 162
, Outlet temperature are 84
, and Feed concentration are 3.4g/200mL. The results showed that yields are 56.432% and rehydration rates are 183.647%. Relative er rors are 2.36% and 6.04%, respectively. 171  Li Li et al.  /  AASRI Procedia   3  ( 2012 )  166 – 171 
 3. Conclusions Yield of the samples and rehydration rate of distillers' hops with spray drying which were affected by inlet temperature, outlet temperature, feed concentration we re studied with orthogonal design. Mathematical models were established by quadratic polynomial stepwise regression on the experimental results. The models are reasonable and reliable which were proved, can be us ed to predict the yield of the samples and rehydration rate. Response surfaces were drawn, and studied factors and their interactions. It was proved that three factors have not significant interactions. Optimum conditions solved for the models are Inlet temperature are 162
, Outlet temperature are 84
, and Feed concentration are 3.4g/200mL. Under these conditions, yield of the samples and rehydration rate in verification tests are 56.432% and 183.647%, respectively.
