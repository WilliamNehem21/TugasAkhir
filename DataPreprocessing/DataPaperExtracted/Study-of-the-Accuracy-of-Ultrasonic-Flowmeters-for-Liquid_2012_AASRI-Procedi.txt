Abstract 
How to estimate the differential time of flight accurately is a challenging problem in the area of ultrasonic flow measurement. High time resolution is necessary, especially in a small inner diameter, short sound path measurement environment, since sound velocity in the liquid is quite fast and the order of magnitude is nanosecond. A newer method to obtain the differential time of flight is a Spline-Based algorithm. Although the calculation accuracy of a Spline-Based algorithm is higher than the common method, cross-correlation algorithm, the calculated quantity of this algorithm is huge. For this reason, an improved Spline-based algorithm is proposed to reduce the computational cost while keeping the accuracy. In addition, i
nstallation location of transducers is one of the most important factors affecting the measurement accuracy of ultrasonic flowmeter. This paper also analyzes the affection of the differential separation distance between transducers
. Experiments have shown that the improved algorithm is effective and the separation distance affects the result seriously.

measurement [1]. These meters can be used as a spool-piece meter  or as a clamp-on meter. But the transit-time clamp-on USFMs are not very robust. Many papers aim to improve the accuracy of the flowmeter. The fluid velocity distribution in the pipe can be obtained using the computational fluid dynamic (CFD) modeling approach
 [2]. The relationships between correction factor K and Reynolds number for different ultrasound paths can be obtained through numerical calculation 
[3]. The accuracy of measuring flow rates changes with the incidence angles
 [4] and upstream installations [5]. Especially, absolute propagation time (the upstream and downstream transit times) always contains the delays ca used by emitting and receiving circuits and the transit time when the signal spreads in the wall and acoustic wedg e. Thus this paper attempts to address this problem.   One of the most important parameters is the differentia l of transit time. We can get it by several ways. The first one is the cross-correlation algorithm. The peak-searc hing algorithm identifies the peak of the discrete function of the cross-correlation using Cosine interpolation algorithm 
[6], Gaussian interpolation algorithm [7] or Parabolic interpolation algorithm. The second one is the sample tracking algorithm. In this algorithm, the time shift of each sample in a delayed echo signal is  measured with respect to a continuous, interpolated representation of the reference echo signal
 [8]. The third one is Spline-Based algorithm. The algorithm uses cubic splines to produce a continuous time represen tation of a reference signal, and then computes an analytical matching function between this reference and a delayed signal. This method is about 500 times better than normalized cross-correlation and entails a substantial computational cost
 [9]. The proposed method improves the Spline-Based al gorithm by combining with the cross-correlation algorithm. The improved algorithm reduces the comput ational cost without reducing the accuracy. This proposed method is evaluated in experiments. In addition, an important part of the installation process is the transducer separation distance previously described. If the signal received by a transducer when set up at the wrong position, the calculation result would be definitel y wrong. This paper analyzes the affection of the differential separation distance between transducers to show the importance to determine the correct position. Experiments have shown that the separation distance affects the result seriously. 2. Proposed Method The flow velocity is calculated by Eq.(1)

 is the refraction angle when the signal passes through the steel-water interface. Ultrasonic transducers are mounted in accordance with the V-shape shown in Fig.1. Transducer X emits ultrasonic waves, and transducer Y receive them. On th e contrary, Transducer Y emits ultrasonic waves, and transducer X receive them. 2.1. Improved Spline-Based Algorithm The differential time of flight, 
t, is a key parameter, and its order of magnitude is nanoseconds. Since sound velocity in the water is quite fast, so high time resolution is necessary, especially in a small inner diameter, short sound path measurement environment. Typically, the cross-correlation algorithm is the most widely used algorithm. And this method is good at rest raining white noise. But simulation results show that the calculation accuracy of the Spline-Based algorithm is higher than the cross-correlation algorithm.  Assume S
1 and S 2 are discrete signals of reference signal and delayed signal (continuous time signal), and each group signal has 2048 points.  Extract the kernel signal from S
1 and S 2 starts from the same point. The kernel signal is the effective part of the ultrasonic. Assume S
1 [n] and S 2 [n] represent the kernel signal. The length of  S
1 [n] is N and The length of S 2 [n] is M, where M<N. As is shown in Fig.2, extracting kernel signal is depending on experience. If M and N are too big, the kernel signal will include useless points. In contrast, if M and N are too small, the useful points will be missed.

i(t) is different from Eq.(3). Signal S 2 [n] has only M points, so f i(t) is the i th segment of M segments which involved in computation. First time, k=0, points of signal S
2 [n] compute with the first to the M
th segment of S 1 [t]. Second time, k=1, points of signal S 2 [n] compute with the second to the M+1 th segment of S
1 [t], and so on. Finally, there are (N-M) t-values. And there must be a t lying between 0 and 1, which called global delay estimate. Differential time of flight 
t is calculated by Eq.(5). 
'()tt k           (5) The calculated quantity of the Spline-Based algorithm is huge. The proposed method can reduce the running time of Spline-Based algorithm while keeping the accuracy.  Before calculating Eq.(4), we can find the maximum point ,m
i, of the cross-correlation function of discrete signals S
1 and S 2 by Fast Fourier Transform.  If m i-1<m i+1, then k=i; Else if m i-1>m i+1, k=i-1. k is the parameter we need in Eq.(5). Since k is a known parameter, we can get t by computing only once. Points of signal S
2 [n] compute with the k+1 to the k+M th segment of S 1 [t] by Eq.(4). It is clear that N-M-1 times calculate quantities are removed. And the speed of algorithm will be increased. 2.2.

of ultrasonic flowmeter. When the wall thickness, the wall material, and the fluid medium are all known quantities and the acoustic path is determined in accordan ce with the V-shape, the separate distance between each transducer should be definite. Assume transducer acoustic wedge is organic glass, and the material of the wall is steel. The fluid medium is water and incid ence angle of ultrasonic wave is 37 degree.

=45o. Longitudinal wave velocity in water is 1480m/s at 20oC, then =19o.The differential distance between transduser X and transducer Y is calculated based these angles.

t is wall thickness, d is inner diameter. At the same time, the value of L AB in turn affect the value of 
 in Eq(1). Assume the position of transducer Y shifts to the right axially 2mm from the correct position. This will cause to refraction angle, 
, 3 degrees bigger than the true value. As a result, the calculation error of water velocity will be up to 11% based on Eq.(1) . Moreover, this impact is more pronounced to small diameter measurement environment. So it is necessary to fine tune the transducer location. 3. Experiment results The experiments are carried out using the clamp-on meter mounted on a stainless-steel pipe which outer diameter is 23 mm and wall thickness is 3 mm. The fl uid medium is water.

In Fig.3, SSE represents the Spline-Based algorithm . Time consuming of Spline-Based algorithm is about 130ms. Time consuming of improved algorithm is appr oximately 8ms. Obviously, the improved method can reduce the running time while keeping the accuracy. 3.2. Effect of axial movement of transducers  Experiment results are shown in Fig.4. The water velo city is calculated by Eq.(1). Moving the transducer B axially to the right from the correct position will lead to increasing of 
, then water velocity will decrease. The velocity is in an inverse ratio of 
. Despite other unknown factors, we only consider the error of separate distance axially. Assume zero point is the correct position.

4. Conclusion The improved Spline-Based method can reduce the running time effectually, and its stability is slightly better than the cross-correlation algorithm as is shown in the environment results. Furthermore, mounting position of transducers should be paid more attention since it  could affect the accuracy of result seriously.
