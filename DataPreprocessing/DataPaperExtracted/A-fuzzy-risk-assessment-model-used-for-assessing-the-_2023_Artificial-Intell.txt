Article history:Received 25 July 2022Received in revised form 8 February 2023Accepted 14 February 2023Available online 16 February 2023African swine fever (ASF) is a contagious and lethal hemorrhagic disease with a high case fatality rate. Since 2007,ASF has been spreading into many countries, especially in Europe and Asia. Given that there is no effective vaccineand treatment to deal with ASF, prevention is an important way for a country to avoid the effects of the virus.Australia is currently ASF-free but the disease has been reported in many neighboring countries, such asIndonesia, Timor-Leste, and Papua New Guinea. Therefore, it is necessary for Australia to maintain hyper-vigilance to prevent the ASF introduction. In this paper, we propose the use of fuzzy concepts to establish afuzzy risk assessment model to predict the ASF introduction risk in Australia. From the analysis, the internationalpassengers (IP) and international import trade (IIT) are concluded as the two main ASF introduction factorsbased on transmission features and past research. From the established fuzzy risk assessment model based onthe analysis of the 2019 and 2020 data, the risks of ASF introduction into Australia are considered to be low.The model further deduced that the Asian region was the major source of potential risks. Finally, in order to val-idate the effectiveness of the established fuzzy risk assessment model, the qualitative data from the Departmentfor Environment, Food & Rural Affairs of the United Kingdom was used. From the validation results, it has shownthat the results were consistent when the same data is adopted, and thus proved that the functionality of theestablished fuzzy risk assessment model for assessing the risk in Australia.© 2023 The Authors.

1. IntroductionAfrican swine fever (ASF) is a transmittable disease and seriouslythreatens swine health. It can cause hemorrhagic fever with a high fatal-ity rate, which could sometimes be almost 100% in domestic and wildpigs. This means that if ASF cause an outbreak, a huge damage couldbe created to the pig industry and the economy of a country(Sánchez-Cordón et al., 2018). For instance, the breeding stock inChina had decreased by 40% due to the ASF epidemic in 2018 ( Huang, 2020), and the price of pork has signiﬁcantly increased while the Con- sumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 4%. In recent years, ASF had spreadquickly in many countries. In 2007, ASF (genotype II) was ﬁrst reported in Georgia. After that, ASF was spread from Georgia to the Caucasus andthen to the European continent in just a few years ( EFSA Panel on Animal Health and Welfare (AHAW) et al., 2019 ). Since 2014, the infec- tion has spread to Eastern, Central, and Western Europe, includingLithuania, Estonia, Poland, Latvia, Czech Republic, Romania, Hungary,Bulgaria, and Belgium (Chenais et al., 2019;Ito et al., 2020). In Septem- ber 2020, Germany has conﬁrmed theﬁrst case of ASF (Sauter-Louis et al., 2021). In terms of timeline and geographic location, ASF hadspread to Western Europe from Eastern Europe. Asia has not reportedany ASF cases before 2018. However, the ﬁrst ASF case appeared in the city of Shenyang, Liaoning province in August 2018 ( Zhao et al., 2019). Since then, ASF had transmitted to many Asian countries and re-gions, including Mongolia, South Korea, Vietnam, Philippines, Laos,Myanmar, Cambodia, Indonesia, Hong Kong, Timor-Leste, and PapuaNew Guinea (Mighell and Ward, 2021;Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations [FAO], 2022 ). ASF appears to have followed the pandemic trend, and it may spread to more countries(Ito et al., 2020).One way to avoid ASF outbreak for a country is to investigate the ASFtransmission pathways. ASF transmission has many pathways, involv-ing feral pigs, domestic pigs and pig products, and soft ticks of thegenus Ornithodoros (Chenais et al., 2019). Humans are recognised as being responsible for long distance virus transmission ( Chenais et al., 2019;Rocque et al., 2011). For instance, in March 2017, an ASF outbreakwas recorded in Irkutsk, Russia, and soon, the virus spread thousands ofkilometers into Europe.Another recent example is the Timor-LesteArtiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 7 (2023) 27 –34

International travelers and tradeare two important human activity pathways for the introduction ofthe virus into ASF-free countries.De La Rocque et al. (2011)considered that the development of international travel and trade has increased therisk of the spread of various infectious diseases. According to Ito et al. (2020), there is a negligible risk via feral pig and vehicle movementsbut there is a risk posed by pork bring into the countries by travelers.Ito et al. (2020)suggested that the pork products in international airpassengers' luggage (PPAP) could be a route that ASF introduce intoASF-free country.Jurado et al. (2019a, 2019b)shared similar opinion. Central News Agency [CAN] (2019)reported a packet of pork was de-tected to contain positive ASF virus on February 19, 2019 at TaipeiSongshan Airport. It was similar in South Korea, there were pork prod-ucts detected with Chinese passengers in 2018 ( Kim et al., 2019). Sugiura et al. (2020)also reported that illegal pork products broughtinto Japan by international travelers was on the rise, and this couldlead to ASF entering Japan. Therefore, PPAP has been proven to be a po-tential route for the spread of ASF across borders. Apart from PPAP,transport-associated routes (TAR) is also a route of ASF introductioninto virus free territories, most of those were related to transport for in-ternational travel and import trade ( Mur et al., 2012).As an example, contaminated pork and other pig products from international transporthad introduced ASF to some ASF-free countries, such as Georgia(Beltrán-Alcrudo et al., 2008).Jurado et al. (2019a, 2019b)’s quantitative model showed the prob-ability of ASF introduction was related to the weight (kg) of PPAPbrought into the region and the probability of PPAP being contaminatedwith ASF. This study also showed that the size of these two data was re-lated to the number of visitors and the passengers' country of origin. Ac-cording to the OIE-WAHIS (2021) and Jurado et al. (2019a, 2019b)’s research, the countries where ASF has been reported were de ﬁned as ASF high-risk. A similar principle was adopted for the variables of TARfromMur et al. (2012)’s model. The level of ASF introduction risk byTAR was affected by the cargo ships originating from ASF-infected coun-tries. In addition, 90% of global trade is by sea freight ( TFG, 2020). There- fore, the larger the import trade could lead to a higher amount ofshipping, which could also increase the risk of ASF introduction. It alsomeans that the greater the proportion of passengers and imports fromASF high-risk countries, the greater the risk of ASF introduction.Building a risk assessment model on ASF can play an important rolein the national bio-security. A mathematical model is an effective toolfor the prediction of the infection spread ( Bhuju et al., 2020). Quantita- tive models were established for the prediction of the risk of ASF intro-duction (Ito et al., 2020;Jurado et al. (2019a, 2019b);Mur et al., 2012). However, the data collection standards are different between thecountry's statistical bureaus. Many types of data could be dif ﬁcult to ﬁnd, such as the annual weight of pork products by passengers, the pos-sibility of passengers carrying pork products. On the other hand, due tothe lack of reliable data, many inferred probabilities are not accurate,which seriously affects the accuracy of the quantitative models. For ex-ample,Ito et al. (2020)mentioned that many farmers sell infected pigswith ASF, which has a direct effect on the risk assessment of the porkproducts. In addition, the models mentioned in Andraud et al. (2021) andSchettino et al. (2021)’s studies may not be appropriate to be ap-
plied in all countries. As shown, these models are developed for use ininland countries such as Romania and Kazakhstan. Thus, most of theland ASF risk introduction factors, such as truck transport and wildboar, are not necessary to be taken into consideration. In addition,Schettino et al. (2021)studied national districts ranking based on ASFoutbreak risk factors rather than risk assessment of ASF introductioninto their countries. The directions of evaluation are different fromthat of the island countries. Given the different factors for considerationand the availabilities of the data required, it is dif ﬁcult to use any existing risk assessment models directly for assessing the introductionrisk for Australia.Although Australia is still free of ASF, there is still a risk that the viruscould be introduced into the country. Since 2007, in addition to thetrend of ASF covering Europe to the West, there is also a trend of theASF invading the Asia-Paciﬁc region to the south (Fig. 1), meaning very close to Australia geographically. In fact, Mighell and Ward (2021)made similar prediction that ASF is likely to enter Australia inthe next few years. However, in order to continue modelling andassessing the risk factors, it is necessary to build a ﬂexible and versatile risk assessment model that can provide insights of the factors. This willenable Australia to improve the prediction, prevention and other mea-sures to maintain its ASF-free status. Therefore, in this work, we en-deavor to establish a new model using fuzzy logic for the assessmentof the introduction risk of ASF into Australia.In medicine and biologyﬁelds, many concepts are uncertain or fuzzy(Massad et al., 1999).Massad et al. (1999)mentioned that there are several levels of uncertainty in,in epidemiology of infections. For exam-ple, poor public health conditions could lead to an increased spread ofinfectious diseases. However, the standard of “poor”is vaguely deﬁned, but somehow being able to be processed by human using logical reason-ing. Human experts normally use such vaguely de ﬁned terms for deci- sion making. In this context, many ASF introduction risk factors, suchas PPAP and, TAR, are difﬁcult to be quantiﬁed accurately for assessing the ASF introduction risk. Therefore, this paper has adopted a new es-tablished model by using fuzzy concepts to deal with unclear, incom-plete or ambiguous data. Fuzzy logic can handle the types ofincomplete and uncertain information data ( Zadeh, 1975). Fuzzy logic is different from classic logic which is dualistic that can be classi ﬁed as true or false only (Shapiro and Kouri Kissel, 2018). However, fuzzy logic is used to deal with the concept of partially true or degree betweenthe‘totally true’and‘totally false’, and an effective way to handle the un-certainty and imprecise data (Zadeh, 1988;Zadeh, 2008).Massad et al. (1999)suggested that fuzzy logic is an effective tool to create rules formodelling the prevention of infections spread. Recently, fuzzy logichas been introduced in many models of infections. Arji et al. (2019) showed that the fuzzy logic model had been widely applied in the diag-nosis infectious diseases, such as dengue fever, hepatitis and tuberculo-sis.Bhuju et al. (2020)used fuzzy approach to analyses the transmissiondynamics of dengue.Issa et al. (2021)developed a risk model to evalu- ate COVID-19 transmission by fuzzy logic. Besides able to handle incom-plete and vaguely deﬁned variables, fuzzy rule based system can alsoprovide human understandable fuzzy rules, which means that the as-sessment can be traced and understandable by human. Therefore,fuzzy system has been selected as the method to establish the newrisk assessment model for Australia in this paper. The methodology pre-sented in this paper can easily be used to build similar risk assessmentmodel with adaption to the factors and availability of data for differentcountries.2. Materials and methods2.1. Data collection & toolTheﬁrst step in building the ASF introduction risk assessment modelfor Australia is to source for the available data that can contribute to thefactors used in the model. The data of international tourism and totalimports of goods, by source country was gathered from the AustralianBureau of Statistics (ABS, 2020) and theWorld Tourism Barometer [UNWTO] (2020; 2021).T h eﬁgures of international passengers of air-line by uplift country was acquired from the Bureau of Infrastructureand Transport Research Economics ( BITRE, 2019;BITRE, 2020). The countries ranking and others information of import values were ac-quired from the Ports Australia and the International Trade Centre(Internatinal Trade Central [ITC], 2020 ). The list of countries with the ASF situation was from OIE-World Animal Health Information databaseinterface (WAHIS, 2021
).H. Liu, Y. Ren, H. Chu et al. Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 7 (2023) 27 –34
282.2. Fuzzy model2.2.1. Fuzzy variablesThe fuzzy risk assessment model is constructed using the MATLABR2020b software. According to previous research ( Jurado et al. (2019a, 2019b);Ito et al., 2020;Mur et al., 2012;De La Rocque et al., 2011), and the location of Australia, international passengers(IP) and international import trade (IIT) have been de ﬁned as the two major factors to be considered for assessing the ASF virus intro-duction to Australia. With pork products carried by IP being one ofthe ASF introduction risks, the number of IP is an important contrib-uting factor. As mentioned earlier, the ASF introduction risk is relatedto shipping. While independent statistics on maritime transportfrom Australia open public data is not available, and given that 98%of Australian international trade is via sea freight according to thePorts Australia. It means that the number of the IIT is related to thatof the freight, and in turn to ASF introduction risk. Thus, IP and IITare two variables used to build this model. However, there aresome factors which could also affect IP and IIT ( Ito et al., 2020; Jurado et al. (2019a, 2019b);Mur et al., 2012). This could suggest that the model can be structured into hierarchical manner usingt w ol a y e r sa ss h o w ni nFig. 2.Kamthan and Singh (2020)proposed the multiple-input single-output system which was suitable for thispaper. A system is divided into several subsystems, each subsystemhas speciﬁc variables, rules and membership functions. After that, itis hierarchically connected to obtain a single output. The two vari-ables, IP and IIT will then become the variables in the upper layer. Ac-cording to previous research (Ito et al., 2020;Jurado et al. (2019a, 2019b);Mur et al., 2012) and the publicly available information(World Animal Health Information database interface [WAHIS],2021;TFG, 2020), the annual number of international passengers, import amount, and those percentage from high risk countriescould affect annual risk value from IP and IIT. Therefore, IP and IITare respectively affected by the two variables in the upper layer.The annual number of passengers, percentage of that from ASF highrisk countries, and the annual amount of international import andpercentage of that with ASF high risk countries will be investigatedin theﬁrst layer (Fig. 2).2.2.2. Membership functions and fuzzy setsThe next step in building the fuzzy risk assessment model forAustralia is to deﬁne the fuzzy membership functions. There are threecommonly used fuzzy membership functions, which are Gaussian, Trap-ezoid and Triangular (Loan et al., 2014). The domain is deﬁned to‘X', and all elements are denoted‘x', wherex∊X. In order to model the ambigu- ity, fuzzy uses the range [0,1] to replace the crisp set (0,1) to describethe degree of truth for elements belonging to the fuzzy set ( Zadeh et al., 1996). According to the previous research, triangular membershipfunction was often used in other type risk assessment models ( Issa et al.,
2021). In this paper, we have also adopted the triangular membership

29function. Based on the characteristics of the variable, the range of mem-bership function is set to [0,100] in this model to align to the range ofpercentage, which is between 0 and 100%.In order to be consistent, the membership function ranges of IP andIIT are also set from 0 to 100. The number of passengers is obtained fromthe international tourist arrivals-country rankings ( World Tourism Barometer [UNWTO], 2020). Since the highest point was always under90 million in recent decades, 100 million is set to be the upper limit.Thus, the range is set between 0 and 100 million and corresponds tothe range from 0 to 100. The range of import was set in a similar man-ner. According to WTO data, the import value of the United State andChina are much higher than any other countries. If their import amountsare set as the upper limit, it may affect the effect of the model. Therefore,10 billion is set as the upper limit. Countries with more than 10 billionare usually only China and the United States. However, in the model,the upper limit is set at 10 billion and it will set to 10 billion when theﬁgure exceeds 10 billion.In this paper, the membership function is de ﬁned asμ(x). The domain isX,Ais the subset ofX, the range is fromx

AxðÞ:X!0, 100½/C138 ð 1ÞA¼x,μ
AxðÞ∣x∊Xgð/C8 ð2ÞBased on past similar research and common fuzzy set partition rules(Issa et al., 2021;Mandal et al., 2012;Mur et al., 2012) the variable is di- vided into 5 fuzzy sets (Fig. 3)t od eﬁne the output and input level (verylow (VL), low (L), medium (M), high (H), very high (VH)) (Table 1). In this paper,ﬁve fuzzy sets cover the entire universe of discourse byusing an equidistant distribution method ( Fig. 3). Five risk levels are used to deﬁne the risk level of the assessment as shown in Table 1. After which, the transitions from one risk level to another are designedusing fuzzy overlapping to create the fuzzy membership functions asshown inFig. 3.2.2.3. Fuzzy rules and veriﬁcationIn this research, we have adopted the Mamdani inference system,and the structure is:R
ᵢ:i fx 1isA 1ᵢandx 2isA 2ᵢ…xnisA nᵢthenuisUᵢ. R
ᵢrepresents thei-th fuzzy rule.Ais the fuzzy set of the input variable,x.Uis the fuzzy set of output variable, u. The Mandani inference system is used as it is easier for human to understand thedecision made.In this paper, linguistic variables are adopted to replace the mathe-matical formulas, which is more suitable for inference uncertain con-cepts for human (Zadeh, 1975). The introduction risk is affected bytwo factor variables, IP and IIT. Until now, there are no commonlyagreed standard to deﬁne IP and IIT. Therefore, we could not acquirespeciﬁc data to build the model. Thus, the paper uses common behaviorand similar model experience, while literature on other infections wasused to deﬁne the rules (Issa et al., 2021). Apart from that, it is assumed that two input parameters IP and IIT are equal to pandt,a n dt h eo u t p u twhich is the risk degree of ASF introduction into Australia (RAM), isequal toj. The Mandani rule relationship could be shown as follows:If IP ispand IIT ist, then RAM isj.In this paper, the matrix approach is used to de ﬁne the fuzzy rules. The abscissa is represented byp(IP) and the ordinate is representedbyt(IIT). According to the customized grade standard, the graderange of the rectangular area can be determined. For example, verylow is from 0 to 20. Then, the upper limit of the very low is 20. Therefore,the very low range of the rectangular area is in the range between 0 and400 (Fig. 4). Similarly, the rectangular area range of each level could beobtained (Table 3). After that, the median of each degree of the horizon-tal and vertical coordinates is used to determine the fuzzy rules by thelevel range of the rectangular area ( Fig. 4). For instance, when IT is low, IIP is medium, and the degree of the output can then be inferred.The medians of low and medium degrees are 30 and 50 respectivelyand 30 times 50 is 1500. According to Table 3, 1500 is located in the low range. Thus, when IT is low and IIP is medium, and the output islow. Apart from that,Issa et al. (2021)’s model also provide similar methodology for building the fuzzy rules.Next, validation is carried to validate the established fuzzy risk as-sessment model. Randomﬁgures are entered into the model. Occasion-ally some outputs turn out to be unreasonable. For instance, in someinput range, it appears that although the input is increased but the out-put isﬁxed or decreased. This means that some linguistic variables ofthe output part are so similar such that the assessment of the model ismisguided. Therefore, a small number of rules are revised and opti-mized with reference to the design methodology in Issa et al. (2021)’s model. The rules can be described as follows:If IP islowAND IIT islow, then the risk of ASF introduction (RAI) islow.The rules could be stated in the matrix as shown in Table 2.T h er u l e s of other layers also adopted the same method. In total, the number offuzzy rules in this model is 75. After the rule bases are formulated, the

The risk of ASF introduction to AustraliaFrom the Cartesian product:A/C2B¼a,bðÞAandb∈Bfg ð 3ÞAandBare two input fuzzy set.It could be adopted to evaluate the two variables of each hierarchicallayer of this model. In this paper, all the rules use the ‘AND’as the fuzzy operator. Thus, the model used two methods for calculation, min andprod. The equations are as follows.μ

A∩BxðÞ ¼prodμAxðÞ,μBxðÞ½/C138 ¼μAxðÞ /C2μBxðÞ ð5ÞThe data of annual international visitors to Australia, the annual per-centage ofﬂight lines by countries, the Australia's import value per yearand the proportion of the import value by countries are used (seeTable 3). The two outputs of theﬁrst layer are then acquired, i.e. theresults of the risk level of IP and IIT, which are entered in the nextlayer as the inputs (Fig. 2).In this paper, the data of the last two years (2019 and 2020) are usedand the trend were analyzed by comparing the two-year results.2.4. Model validationIn order to assess the validity of the model, other assessment resultscan be used to validate the functionality of the established fuzzy risk as-sessment model. According to theDepartment for Enviorment Food andRural Affairs of United kingdom government (2018) , a qualitative method was used to assess the risk of ASF introduction to the UnitedKingdom which was also divided intoﬁve risk levels (i.e. very low, low, medium, high and very high). DEFRA referred to a variety of datafrom other European countries and their own country, such as tradeamount, pig import amount. Based on the survival time of ASFV in dif-ferent biological environments, the ASF epidemiology and the outbreaksituation in Europe, it calculated the risk level of the ASF impact for theUK through different pathways. One parameter of their method, whichis transport is similar to the IIT variable of the established fuzzy risk as-sessment model. Thus, the number of United Kingdom import and thepercentage of import value are used in our model ( Internatinal Trade Central [ITC], 2020). After that, the risk levels generated by the twomethods are compared.Table 2Fuzzy rules matrix and linguistic variables for inputs and outputs.Risk degree Impact on ASF introductionVery low Low Medium High Very highVery low Very low Very low Low Low MediumLow Very low Low Low Medium MediumMedium Low Low Medium Medium HighHigh Low Medium Medium High Very highVery high Medium Medium High Very high Very high

313. Results3.1. The analysis for ASF-introduction to AustraliaAccording to the statistic ofAustralian Bureau of Statistics [ABS](2020)andWorld Tourism Barometer [UNWTO] (2020) , theﬁgure of the international tourism to Australia is 9.47 million in 2019. However,theﬁgure has decreased 80.7% to 1.8 million in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, data from BITRE (2019 & 2020) show that theﬂight percentage of ASF high risk countries accounted for 28.8% and 24%in 2019 and 2020, respectively. The amount of Australia's importwere 214 and 202 billion dollars in 2019 and 2020, respectively(Internatinal Trade Central [ITC], 2020 ). The probability of import amount from ASF high risk countries ( World Animal Health Information database interface [WAHIS], 2021 ) are 44.9% and 47.0% after calculation based on merchandise imports sheet of Australian Bureau of Statistics [ABS] (2020). Data of theﬁrst layer variables are showed inTable 4.After inferring theﬁrst layer, the risk values of IP are 19.9 (2019) and11.6 (2020) and those of IIT are 24.7 (2019) and 24.8 (2020). All outputsofﬁrst layer are then entered to the second layer as inputs. The ﬁnal out- puts, i.e. the risk of ASF introduction to Australia, are therefore 24.4(2019) and 21.3 (2020) (Table 5). All of the outputs indicated low risk(L) from the fuzzy risk assessment model. Thus, the risk of ASF introduc-tion in Australia is low risk (L). The result is obtained as can be tracedback to theﬁrst layer of the risk assessment model structure ( Fig. 2). The number of tourists, 9.47 million and 1.8 million, input into themodel belonged to theVLand the percentage, 28.8% and 24% are alsobelonged to the L. To better understand which fuzzy rule is used toinfer such decision, the following fuzzy rule can be observed.If the annual tourist amount isVLand the percentage isL, then the IP isVL.For another part, the values of IP are 19.9 and 11.6, both of them areconsidered asVL. It is similar to the calculation of the IIT, the importamounts are 214 and 202 billion ( L). Theﬁgure of percentage, 44.9% and 47.0%, belonged to M. Therefore, the fuzzy rule triggered is asfollow.If the import amount is L and the percentage is M, then the IP is L.Thus, both of theﬁgures, IIT are L (24.7, 24.8).The rule used is then:If IP is VLAND IIT isL, then the risk of ASF introduction (RAI) is VL. As a result, this will provide theﬁnal value to indicate the risk level ofthe ASF introduction into Australia.3.2. The result of model validationTheﬁ
gure of the United Kingdom import amount was 692 billiondollars in 2019 (World Trade Organization [WTO], 2020 ) and the per- centage of import amount from ASF high risk countries was 47.6% (trad-ing economics). After putting the data into the established fuzzy riskassessment model, the output (i.e. risk level) obtained is 46.7. It belongsto the medium risk level. According to the prediction result ofDepartment for Enviorment Food and Rural Affairs of United kingdomgovernment (2018), the risk of transport was medium. The two predic-tion results are basically the same. Therefore, the prediction of this fuzzyrisk assessment model has been validated.4. Discussion4.1. Results analysisIn this paper, the prediction results based on 2019 and 2020 data aredue to that, the data of 2019 was highest than past and could representthe highest Australia level in normal years. For compare and analyze thetrend after COVID-19 epidemic, 2020 data is cited.The output value of this model is affected by the second layer inputvariables (Fig. 2). However, the second layer inputs are the outputs oftheﬁrst layer. Those are also affected by the ﬁrst layer inputs. Thus, theﬁnal output of the model is ultimately affected by the ﬁrst layer. However, this presented an opportunity to understand which part ofthe model provided the effect of theﬁnal prediction. The advantage of using fuzzy modelling is the ability to be traced back by using humanunderstandable fuzzy rules. The Australia risk degree is low (24.4 and21.3), which is due to that some Australia's values of the ﬁrst layer in- puts are located in the low or very low degree in the world, such as an-nual import amount and annual international tourist amount. Inaddition, the IP is from 19.9 to 11.6 but is the ﬁnal output just from 24.4 to 21.3. The drop is not obvious as IP because IIT is relative stable,according to one of the rules as follow:If IP is VL AND IIT is L, then the risk of ASF introduction (RAI) is VL.However, both of the IP values belong to VL, and IIT values belong toL but both of theﬁnal results belong to the L. Although the value (19.9)of IP (2019) belongs to VL but it is very close to the next degree (L). Inother words, the attribution degree is closer to the L level than mostVL level values, this affected theﬁnal output. IP (2020) decrease causestheﬁnal result decrease but theﬁnal result is also located to L. It may bedue to that the intersection and the boundary between fuzzy sets islarge and unclear than those between crisp sets. Thus, the degree loca-tion of output may not be completely corresponding to the fuzzy rules.In our results, the risks of TAR are similar between 2019 and 2020but theﬁgure of IP has signiﬁcantly decreased from 19.9 to 11.6. Themajor reason is the COVID-19 pandemic, which has led to huge decreaseof international tourists. To prevent COVID-19 spread, most countrieshave adopted lockdown, widely restricted international travel ( Sam et al., 2020).World Tourism Barometer [UNWTO] (2020) reported that the international tourism had reduced by 74% or 1 billion. Itmeans that, the risk factors brought by passengers have decreased,and the major risk will be due to the international trade in the nextfew years. However, international tourism will eventually recover.Behsudi (2020)suggests that international travel may return to thelevel of 2019 by 2023. The risk will increase again and our model will

32provide the direction for such ASF risk from the model. In addition, themajor ASF risk will be coming from Asia. According to the data of the im-port with high ASF risk countries (Table 3), three of the topﬁve coun- tries are Asian countries, China, Malaysia, South Korea and the threeAsian countries account for about 80% of all high-risk countries. In addi-tion, the top fourﬂights amount from high risk countries or regions areall from Asia. These include China, Indonesia, Hong Kong (China) andMalaysia (Table 3) which altogether account for almost all the high-risk countries. Coincidentally, the other papers also predicted that theintroduction risk from Asian countries is high. Ito et al. (2020)suggested that China and Vietnam could be the top countries with highest ASF in-troduction risk into Japan.Jurado et al. (2019a, 2019b)suggests that most of the ASF-introduction risk into the United States is related toﬂights from China and Hong Kong (China). Therefore, it could be con-cluded that Asia will be the highest risk region of ASF introductioninto Australia.The model is depended on the available data and the features of ASFcross-border spread to provide the corresponding variables. By compar-ing with the inference of theDepartment for Enviorment Food and RuralAffairs of United kingdom government (2018) , the result of this fuzzy model can be validated. However, the fuzzy model objectively infersinput values based on the rule base. The size of input represents the ob-jective conditions of the tested country. In reality, high risk does notnecessarily mean that it will happen, and low risk does not mean itwill never happen. For example, in terms of the number of internationaltourists and international trade, the United States may be a high-riskcountry. However, until now, the United States is still ASF-free. Japan,like Australia, is an island country but Japan's import trade is muchlarger than Australia, and it is closer to high-risk areas such as Chinaand South Korea. Japan is also ASF-free. It shows that the spread ofASF may be also related to others factor such as diagnosis level, publichealth conditions, and economic level. For example, since ASF outbreakin China in 2018, it has spread to 15 Asian countries by October 2021.However, apart from South Korea, the remaining countries are all nothigh-income countries (Hamadeh et al., 2021). Therefore, getting more accurate assessment could only be achieved by gathering othertypes of data. As the methodology presented in this paper, the fuzzyrisk assessment can be established and adjusted easily with any newdata or knowledge.4.2. Fuzzy model features analysisFuzzy model is mostly depended on fuzzy rules to describe the rela-tionships between fuzzy sets, and the fuzzy rules are usually expressedin the form of IF-THEN (Zadeh, 1988;Perﬁlieva, 2006). Mamdani fuzzy inference is a common fuzzy inference system used in many ﬁelds and is very suitable for medical research, due to its computation ef ﬁciency and can be directly interpreted (Gayathri and Sumathi, 2015). There are three main advantages. To begin with, the use of fuzzy model is easyto understand andﬂexible to be build. It also provides a set of humanunderstandable fuzzy rules, which the results can be traced back easilyto the variables that determine the output. In addition, the model couldbe easily modiﬁed or changed. The creation of fuzzy model requires thecombination of knowledge and data, and it does not require largeamount of labeled data that many machine learning techniques require.Taking this research as an example, the data available are inconsistentand could be different from country to country due to the unique condi-tions of each country. If other researchers want to use the establishedmethodology to investigate other countries' situation or other infec-tions, this modelling allows the adding, deletion or replacement of theinput variables by using the same principles in creating the model. Fi-nally, fuzzy model could help to deal with uncertain or hypotheticalproblems. Compared with crisp sets, fuzzy sets generally have overlap-ping boundaries. There is overlap between adjacent fuzzy sets ( Mandal et al., 2012) to model the fuzziness between the fuzzy sets. The ability ofmodelling the overlapping between the memberships as demonstratedin this paper could model the vagueness and uncertainty better.All models will normally have some limitations in application or de-velopment. There are some limitations in the proposed methodology in
this paper. Firstly, the variables used in this paper is subject to the avail-abilities of the data. For example, some of the international touristscome to Australia by cruise ships. However, there is no information onthe nationality distribution of cruise passengers and the number of an-nual arrivals from the Australia's statistical websites. It is good to notethat this is a limitation from the available data perspective and not alimitation from the use of the fuzzy modelling. When any new data isavailable, the steps and methodology reported in this paper that usedto establish the fuzzy risk assessment can be repeated easily. Secondly,similar toIssa et al. (2021), the output of the fuzzy model, dependvery much on the design of the fuzzy membership. If the range of thevalue is too big, the output variation could be very small when thefuzzy membership is evenly distributed. The fuzzy model output isalso limited by the number of fuzzy memberships used in the inputand output model. Using more fuzzy membership will improve the res-olution of the model. However, it is worth noted that with the increasein the number of fuzzy membership (i.e. linguistics terms), the numberof fuzzy rules may increase signiﬁcantly as well, thus making the fuzzymodel more difﬁcult to be interpreted. Finally, the model is only a quan-titative analysis and only make a risk assessment based on objectiveconditions, more study will need to be done to translate the quantitativeindication of the risk.5. ConclusionIn this study, we have built a quantitative fuzzy risk assessmentmodel to assess the ASF introduction risk into Australia. The contribu-tion of this paper is two folds. Firstly, the ASF introduction risk assess-ment model has been established using fuzzy modelling technique.Secondly, the established model is used to provide insights of the risklevel for the ASF introduction into Australia. Our analysis is based onthe number of international tourists, import amount and the percentageof those from high ASF risk countries. From the analysis of the data col-lected for Australia and by using our fuzzy risk assessment model, thefollowing can be concluded. Australia is a low risk country to ASF intro-duction. The risk from international tourists has shown a downwardtrend between 2019 and 2020. According to the analysis for importandﬂight amount, the highest introduction risk will be from Asia coun-tries. This study will help customs and other relevant departments de-velop more effective inspection and monitoring methods to protectAustralia's biosecurity.Authors' statementsHK Liu was responsible for model design, data collection, and manu-script writing.
