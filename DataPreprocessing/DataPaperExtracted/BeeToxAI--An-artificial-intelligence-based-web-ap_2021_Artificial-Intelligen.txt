Chemically  induced  toxicity is the leading cause of recent extinction  of honey bees. In this regard, we developed  
an innovative  artiÔ¨Åcial  intelligence-based  web app (BeeToxAI)  for assessing  the acute toxicity of chemicals  to 
Apis mellifera  . Initially,  we developed  and externally  validated  QSAR models for classiÔ¨Åcation  (external  set accu- 
racy ‚àº91%) through  the combination  of Random  Forest and molecular  Ô¨Ångerprints  to predict the potential  for 
chemicals  to cause acute contact toxicity and acute oral toxicity to honey bees. Then, we developed  and exter- 
nally validated  regression  QSAR models ( ùëÖ 2 = 0.75) using Feedforward  Neural Networks  (FNNs). Afterward,  the 
best models were implemented  in the publicly  available  BeeToxAI  web app ( http://beetoxai.labmol.com.br/  ) . 
The outputs of BeeToxAI  are: toxicity predictions  with estimated  conÔ¨Ådence,  applicability  domain estimation,  
and color-coded  maps of relative structure  fragment  contributions  to toxicity.  As an additional  assessment  of 
BeeToxAI  performance,  we collected  an external  set of pesticides  with known bee toxicity that were not included  
in our modeling  dataset. BeeToxAI  classiÔ¨Åcation  models were able to predict four out of Ô¨Åve pesticides  correctly.  
The acute contact toxicity model correctly  predicted  all of the eight pesticides.  Here we demonstrate  that Bee- 
ToxAI can be used as a rapid new approach  methodology  for predicting  acute toxicity of chemicals  in honey 
bees. 
1. Introduction  
Pesticides  play an essential  role in protecting  plants and reducing  
large-scale  agricultural  crop losses from insects and pathogens  [ 1 , 2 ]. 
However,  several harmful  eÔ¨Äects of pesticides  on aquatic  and terrestrial  
ecosystems  have been described  in the literature,  particularly  towards  
non-target  species such as Ô¨Åshes, earthworms,  birds, and bees [ 3 , 4 ]. In 
the past few years, there has been increased  concern  regarding  the im- 
pact of pesticides  on bees [5‚Äì9] . During foraging  or nectar, pollen, and

array of pesticides  [10] . Very often, contaminated  bees carry these haz- 
ardous chemicals  back to the hive, potentially  inducing  sub-lethal  or 
lethal eÔ¨Äects for the entire colony [ 10 , 11 ]. 
The drastic extinction  of bees is a serious threat to global food secu- 
rity and planetary  ecosystem  stability  [ 12 , 13 ]. For this reason,  scientiÔ¨Åc  
advisory  bodies and government  agencies  have employed  standardized  
protocols  to test the acute toxicity  of active pesticide  ingredients  against  
adult honey bees ( Apis mellifera  ) [14‚Äì17]  . The United States Environ-

provides  both a short and long-term  strategy  to assess the risks posed 
against  honey bees by pesticides  [16] . These animals  can be exposed  to 
pesticide  residues  by indirect  contact  on plant surfaces,  via oral intake 
with contaminated  water or food, or by direct contact  during their ap- 
plication  in standard  farming  practice.  If the proposed  use pattern  of a 
pesticide  indicates  a possible  exposure  of honey bees, acute contact  and 
oral toxicity  studies are necessary  for pesticide  registration  [16] . 
The acute toxicity  tests examine  the eÔ¨Äects of a pesticide  after a 
short-term  exposure  (24‚Äì96 h) using the median  lethal dose that in- 
duces death in 50% of the population  (LD 50 ). The predominant  exposure  
routes are through  contact  (i.e., direct spray) or oral incubation  (i.e., 
consumption  of nectar and pollen).  Both the contact  and oral toxicity  
tests report toxicity  values as ùúág/bee.  If a pesticide‚Äôs  active ingredient  
is classiÔ¨Åed  as highly or moderately  toxic (LD 50 < 11 ùúág/bee),  it would 
require  complementary  studies to determine  acute oral toxicity  and fo- 
liage test using the Ô¨Ånal product  [18] . The US EPA estimates  that studies 
required  for pesticide  registration  cost around $ 13,400 for honey bee 
acute toxicity,  with a semi-Ô¨Åeld  study on honey bees reaching  $133,300  
per chemical  [19] . 
Understanding  the costly and time-consuming  characteristics  of ex- 
perimental  assays, in silico models have emerged  as a practical  solu- 
tion to be employed  as screening  tools and within integrated  testing 
strategies  to avoid animal testing as well as reduce cost and chemical  
waste [20] . Computational  strategies  comply  with the ‚Äú3R‚Äôs ‚Äùprinciple  
of replacement,  reÔ¨Ånement,  and reduction  of animal testing [21] . The 
more simplistic  approaches  are based on the concept  that compounds  
sharing  structural  similarity  (read-across)  [22] or certain substructures  
(structural  alerts) [23] have increased  probability  to share the same tox- 
icological  properties  [22] . However,  there has been a growing  concern  
that structural  alerts disproportionally  Ô¨Çag too many chemicals  as toxic, 
which questions  their reliability  as toxicity  markers  [23] . Therefore,  
their use in regulatory  toxicology  has been hampered  by the lack of 
transparency  and interpretability  [23] . 
Consequently,  Quantitative  Structure-Activity/Toxicity  Relationship  
(QSAR/QSTR)  models have been developed  as alternative  methods  to 
experimental  tests and rule-based  methods.  QSAR modeling  reveals re- 
lationships  between  structural  properties  of chemical  compounds  and 
corresponding  biological/toxicological  properties  [22‚Äì24]  . These char- 
acteristics  confer more accurate  predictions  of the toxicity  of untested  
chemicals  from their chemical  structures  [23] . Currently,  the most 
modern  QSAR methodologies  are developed  using artiÔ¨Åcial  intelligence  
methods,  such as machine  learning  (ML) and deep learning  (DL) algo- 
rithms [ 25 , 26 ]. ML is a growing  Ô¨Åeld of artiÔ¨Åcial  intelligence  that uses 
diÔ¨Äerent  statistical  techniques  to enable computers  to learn from chem- 
ical and biological  or toxicological  data without  being explicitly  pro- 
grammed  for this task [27] . These algorithms  are capable  of capturing  
the complex  nonlinear  relationships  between  the relevant  descriptors  
(i.e., mathematical  representations  of molecules‚Äô  properties)  and the ob- 
served properties/toxicities  [ 26 , 28 ]. 
Although  QSAR is widespread  in the ecotoxicology  Ô¨Åeld, there are 
few freely available  QSAR-based  tools with a graphical  interface  to as- 
sess the oral and acute contact  toxicity  of chemicals  to honey bees 
[ 29 , 30 ]. Similarly,  no QSAR model has been reported  to assess acute 
oral toxicity  of chemicals  to honey bees. In addition,  a critical analysis  
reveals that the vast majority  of the published  models do not comply  
with the OECD principles  [31] , as well as best practices  for data cura- 
tion [32‚Äì34]  and QSAR modeling  [35] . The main drawbacks  of previous  
QSAR studies includes:  (i) lack of evidence  on data curation  and dupli- 
cate analysis  [ 29 , 36‚Äì38 ]; (ii) use of an undeÔ¨Åned  or confusing  endpoint  
[29] ; (iii) lack of AD estimation  [ 29 , 37 , 39 ]; and (iv) lack of mechanistic  
interpretation  [ 29 , 36‚Äì39 ]. For example,  although  the models developed  
by Wang et al. [29] . and implemented  in the BeeTox  web app have sat- 
isfactory  predictive  performance,  estimates  of the applicability  domain  
(DA) and mechanistic  interpretation  of the predictions  were not pro- 
vided. In addition,  we found more than 60 duplicates  in its dataset,  
which can lead to overestimation  of the model. Thus, their reliability  for assessing  chemically-induced  acute toxicity  for honey bees is not as- 
sured. 
Hence, this manuscript  describes  the development  and application  
of an easily accessible,  open-source,  public-facing  web application  (Bee- 
ToxAI: http://beetoxai.labmol.com.br/  ) to democratize  access to these 
predictive  QSAR models for a wide range of stakeholders,  including  reg- 
ulators,  regulated  industry,  research  scientists,  and the public. BeeToxAI  
is the Ô¨Årst web app for the prediction  of acute contact  and oral toxicity  
in honey bees fully compliant  with the stringent  predictive  modeling  
practices  [35] and OECD guidelines  [31] . 
2. Material  and methods  
2.1. Datasets  
A dataset of compounds  containing  experimental  acute toxicity  data 
for honey bees ( A. mellifera  ) was collected  from the scientiÔ¨Åc  literature  
[40‚Äì52]  , as well as the US EPA‚Äôs Ecotox database  [53] , EFSA‚Äôs Open- 
FoodTox  database  [54] , and Online Chemical  Modeling  Environment  
(OCHEM)  database  [55] . Data integration  resulted  in an uncured  dataset 
consisting  of 2543 pesticide  and pesticide-like  compounds  representing  
diÔ¨Äerent  classes (e.g., insecticides,  herbicides,  fungicides)  and with a 
wide spectrum  of toxicity  mechanisms.  Then, compounds  with a me- 
dian lethal dose (LD 50, ùúág/bee)  for adult honey bee recorded  after 48 h 
were categorized  into toxic and nontoxic  using a threshold  of 11 ùúág/bee 
as described  in the US EPA test guidelines  [16] . Compounds  were di- 
vided into two independent  datasets  according  to honey bee exposure  
type (contact  and oral). A brief description  of the datasets  is presented  
below: 
‚Ä¢ Contact  exposure  dataset (File S1): 615 compounds  with LD 50 data 
for contact  exposure  of honey bees. It consisted  of 229 toxic com- 
pounds  with LD 50 ‚â§ 11 ùúág/bee and 386 nontoxic  compounds  (LD 50 
> 11 ùúág/bee).  
‚Ä¢ Oral exposure  dataset (File S2): 211 compounds  with LD 50 data 
for contact  exposure  of honey bees. It consisted  of 93 toxic com- 
pounds  with LD 50 ‚â§ 11 ùúág/bee and 118 nontoxic  compounds  (LD 50 
> 11 ùúág/bee).  
2.2. Data curation  
All chemical  structures  and correspondent  LD 50 data were carefully  
standardized  using Standardizer  v.16.9.5.0  (ChemAxon,  Budapest,  Hun- 
gary) according  to the protocols  proposed  by Fourches  and colleagues  
[32‚Äì34]  . BrieÔ¨Çy,  explicit  hydrogens  were added, whereas  salts, mix- 
tures, polymers,  and organometallic  compounds  were removed.  In addi- 
tion, speciÔ¨Åc  chemotypes  such as aromatic  rings and nitro groups were 
normalized.  Then, we performed  the analysis  and exclusion  of dupli- 
cates. Distinct  criteria  were employed,  as follows:  
‚Ä¢ ClassiÔ¨Åcatory  QSAR models:  ( i ) if duplicates  presented  discordance  in 
toxicological  outcomes  (e.g., toxic vs nontoxic),  both entries would 
be excluded;  and ( ii ) if the reported  outcomes  of the duplicates  were 
the same, one entry would be retained  in the dataset and the other 
excluded.  After duplicate  removal,  the contact  exposure  dataset had 
382 compounds  (toxic: 112, nontoxic:  269), while the oral exposure  
dataset had 169 compounds  (toxic: 71, nontoxic:  98). 
‚Ä¢ Regression  QSAR models : ( i ) duplicates  were inspected  visually,  ( ii ) 
if duplicates  presented  discordant  potencies,  both entries would be 
excluded;  and ( iii ) if the reported  potencies  were similar,  an aver- 
age of the values was calculated,  and one entry was retained  in the 
dataset.  Subsequently,  the LD 50 values were converted  to negative  
logarithmic  ( ‚àí log) units (pLD 50 ) at ŒºM range. At the end of this pro- 
cess, the contact  exposure  dataset had 218 compounds,  while the 
oral exposure  dataset had 142 compounds.

2.3. Chemical  space analysis  
The chemical  space formed  by toxic and nontoxic  compounds  for A. 
mellifera  and 2044 commercial  pesticides  (untested  against  A. mellifera  ) 
collected  from Pesticide  Product  Information  System Database  [56] was 
analyzed  by plotting  a similarity  map and was generated  using OSIRIS 
DataWarrior  software  v.05.02.01  [57] . The similarity  map uses a Rub- 
berbanding  ForceÔ¨Åeld  approach,  which translates  similarity  (vertices)  
between  compounds  (nodes).  The approach  involves  the following  steps: 
( i ) randomly  positioning  all compounds  in 2D space; ( ii ) calculating  the 
similarity  matrix between  all compounds  using Tanimoto  coeÔ¨Écients  
(Tc) and FragFP descriptors;  ( iii ) location  of most similar neighbors  (Tc 
> 0.8) to be considered  for every compound;  and ( iv ) stepwise  relocation  
of all compounds  to ensure similar molecules  were located  close to each 
other [57] . 
2.4. ClassiÔ¨Åcation  models 
The models were developed  in Python v.3.6 58 following  best prac- 
tices for QSAR modeling  [35] , and are fully compliant  with OECD prin- 
ciples for validation  of QSAR modeling  for regulatory  purposes,  i.e., a 
deÔ¨Åned  endpoint,  an unambiguous  algorithm,  a deÔ¨Åned  domain  of ap- 
plicability,  appropriate  measures  of goodness-of-Ô¨Åt,  robustness  and pre- 
dictivity,  and a mechanistic  interpretation  if possible  [31] . 
2.4.1. Molecular  Ô¨Ångerprints  
Molecular  ACCess  System (MACCS)  keys, Morgan  (ECFP-like),  and 
FeatMorgan  (FCFP-like)  Ô¨Ångerprints  were calculated  in the open-source  
cheminformatics  software  RDKit [59] with a diameter  of 4‚Äì8 and bit 
vector of 2048 bits [60] . ECFPs are circular  Ô¨Ångerprints  that captures  
highly speciÔ¨Åc  atomic information  enabling  the representation  of a large 
set of precisely  deÔ¨Åned  structural  features  [61] , whereas  FCFP Ô¨Ånger- 
prints captures  functional  features  (i.e., hydrogen-bond  donor and ac- 
ceptors,  aromatic,  halogen,  and basic and acid groups)  [62] . 
2.4.2. Dataset splitting  and 5-fold cross-validation  
The general  Ô¨Çowchart  for splitting  contact  and oral datasets  of com- 
pounds  is shown in Supplementary  Fig. S1. Initially,  datasets  were split 
into modeling  sets (80% of compounds)  and external  sets (20% of com- 
pounds)  using the random  distribution  approach.  The modeling  sets 
were used to generate  QSAR models through  a 5-fold external  cross- 
validation  (5FCV) approach,  while the external  sets were used to assess 
the predictive  power of models.  The structural  diversity  of the mod- 
eling and external  set compounds  was evaluated  using the similarity  
maps. These plots show that external  set compounds  occupy the same 
chemical  space as the modeling  set compounds.  The modeling  sets were 
subjected  to 5FCV approach  where Ô¨Åve subsets of equal size were gen- 
erated. Together,  four subsets (80% of the modeling  set) were used to 
build the QSAR models (training  set) and the remaining  subset of 20% 
(test set) was employed  to evaluate  the robustness  of the QSAR model. 
QSAR models were developed  Ô¨Åve times, allowing  each of the Ô¨Åve sub- 
sets to be used as a momentary  test set. The 5FCV modeling  procedure  
was followed  by an evaluation  of the model performance  using the ex- 
ternal holdout  sets. 
2.4.3. QSAR modeling  and hyperparameter  optimization  
QSAR models were developed  using the Support  Vector Machine  
(SVM) [63] and Random  Forest (RF) [64] algorithms  implemented  in 
Scikit-learn  v.0.24.2  [65] . Since the performance  of ML is closely related 
to its hyperparameters,  the models were optimized  using a Bayesian  ap- 
proach implemented  in Scikit-Optimize  v.0.7.4 [66] . Details of hyper- 
parameters  explored  in this work are available  in the Supporting  Infor- 
mation.  The Bayesian  optimization  may be deÔ¨Åned  as follows:  
P (ùëì
 D 1‚à∂ ùë° )‚àùP
 (D
 1‚à∂ ùë° ùëì )P
 ( ùëì ) (1) 
where, x i is the i th sample,  and ùëì(x i ) is the observation  of the objective  
function  at x i . The observations  D 1: t = {x 1: t , ùëì(x 1: t )} are accumulated.  The prior distribution  is combined  with the likelihood  function  P(D 1: t | ùëì) 
of overserving  D 1‚à∂ ùë° given model ùëìmultiplied  by the prior probability  
of P( ùëì) . In doing so, Bayesian  optimization  Ô¨Ånds hyperparameters  that 
maximize  the objective  function  (G-mean  score) by building  a surrogate  
function  (probabilistic  model) based on past evaluation  hyperparame-  
ters of the objective  [ 66 , 67 ]. The geometric  (G)-mean  was selected  as 
the scorer since it measures  the balance  between  classiÔ¨Åcation  perfor- 
mances  on both the majority  (nontoxic)  and minority  (toxic) classes.  
2.4.4. Threshold-moving  
The QSAR models were calibrated  using a threshold-moving  ap- 
proach implemented  in Scikit-learn  v.0.24.2  [65] . This approach  uses 
diÔ¨Äerent  probability  thresholds  in the range of 0 to 1 obtained  via the 
Receiver  Operating  Characteristic  (ROC) curve to Ô¨Ånd the threshold  
with the largest G-mean  value. Thus, it is easier to predict the minority  
class examples  accurately.  To use the G-mean  value as the model bound- 
ary class, we implemented  a Python class to overlay  toxicity  prediction  
and its probability  in the Scikit-learn  framework.  Subsequently,  prob- 
ability values were scaled to estimate  the conÔ¨Ådence  of predictions  as 
follows:  
ùë• ùëõùëúùëüùëöùëéùëôùëñùëßùëíùëë  = ùë• ‚àí min ( ùë• ) 
max ( ùë• ) ‚àí min ( ùë• ) (2) 
where min ( ùë• ) denotes  the minimum  of the range of your measurement,  
max ( ùë• ) denotes  the maximum  of the range of your measurement,  and 
ùë• ‚àà[ min ( ùë• ) , max ( ùë• ) ] denotes  your measurement  to be scaled. Proba- 
bilities ùë• are on the interval  [0,1], with ùë• = min ( ùë• ) mapped  to 0 and 
ùë• = max ( ùë• ) mapped  to 1. 
2.4.5. Assessment  of model performance  
The internal  and external  predictive  performances  of QSAR mod- 
els were evaluated  using accuracy  (ACC), sensitivity  (SE), speciÔ¨Åcity  
(SP), positive  predictive  value (PPV), negative  predictive  value (NPV), 
Matthews  correlation  coeÔ¨Écient  (MCC),  and area under the receiver  
operating  characteristic  curve (AUC). These metrics  were calculated  as 
follows:  
ACC = TP + TN 
N (3) 
SE = TP 
TP + FN (4) 
SP = TN 
TN + FP (5) 
PPV = TP 
TP + FP (6) 
NPV = TN 
TN + FN (7) 
MCC = TP x TN ‚àí FP x FN ‚àö
( ùëá ùëÉ + ùêπ ùëÉ ) ( ùëá ùëÉ + ùêπ ùëÅ ) ( ùëá ùëÅ + ùêπ ùëÉ ) ( ùëá ùëÅ + ùêπ ùëÅ ) (8) 
AUC = ‚àë
i [(S
 E ùëñ +1 )(S
 P ùëñ +1 ‚àí S P i )] (9)
 
where N represents  the number  of compounds,  TP and TN represent  the 
number  of true positives  and true negatives,  and FP and FN represent  
the number  of false positives  and false negatives,  respectively.  
In addition  to the above model evaluation  metrics,  Cohen‚Äôs  kappa 
( ùúÖ) was used to measure  the agreement  between  experimental  data and 
model predictions  [68] . This statistical  parameter  is calculated  by the 
following  equations:  
Pr ( ùëé ) = TP + TN 
N (10) 
Pr ( e ) = ( TP + FP ) x ( TP + FN ) + ( TN + FN ) x ( TN + FP ) 
N (11) 
3 J.T. Moreira-Filho, R.C. Braga, J.M. Lemos et al. ArtiÔ¨Åcial Intelligence in the Life Sciences 1 (2021) 100013 
Œ∫= Pr ( ùëé ) ‚àí Pr ( ùëí ) 
1 ‚àí Pr ( ùëí ) (12) 
where Pr(e) is the hypothetical  probability  of chance agreement,  and 
Pr(a) represents  the relative  observed  agreement  between  the predicted  
classiÔ¨Åcation  of the model and the known classiÔ¨Åcation.  
2.4.6. Applicability  domain (AD) 
Any QSAR model needs to demonstrate  not only good accuracy  but 
also characterize  the reliability  of external  predictions.  To address  the 
latter, the AD of models was estimated  using Dice similarity  ( D ùëÜ ) be- 
tween a compound  under prediction  (A) and the training  set compounds  
(B) [69] . The Dc is calculated  by the following  equation:  
D S = 2 |A ‚à©B |
|A |+ |B | (13) 
where a set with vertical  bars on either side refers to the cardinality  of 
the set, i.e., the number  of bits (Ô¨Ångerprints)  in that set. The ‚à©is used 
to represent  the intersection  of two sets (bits that are common  to both 
sets). Then, an AD threshold  ( D T ) was deÔ¨Åned  to estimate  the reliability  
of external  predictions:  
D T = ÃÑy + ZœÉ (14)  
where ”Øis the average  D ùëÜ of the compounds  under prediction  and train- 
ing set compounds,  ùúéis the standard  deviation  of D ùëÜ , and Z is an arbi- 
trary parameter  to control the signiÔ¨Åcance  level. We set the default value 
of this parameter  Z at 0.5. If the compound  distance  exceeds  the D T , the 
prediction  may be considered  less trustworthy  [70] . 
2.5. Regression  models 
Then, regression  models based on Feedforward  Neural Networks  
(FNNs) were developed  using Keras ( https://keras.io/  ), and TensorÔ¨Çow  
( www.tensorÔ¨Çow.org  ) as backend.  Initially,  the datasets  were split into 
modeling  sets (80% of compounds)  and test sets (20% of compounds)  
using the random  distribution  approach.  Then, regression  models were 
developed  using ECFP4 Ô¨Ångerprints  and pLD 50 values at ŒºM range. The 
architecture  of the FNNs was optimized  according  to the following  com- 
binations:  layer type (dense),  number  of hidden layers (3‚Äì7), activation  
functions  (ReLU, Elu, Selu), output layer function  (sigmoid),  model op- 
timizer (Adam).  The ‚Äúmean squared  error ‚Äùwas used as a loss function.  
The ‚Äúmean absolute  error ‚Äù was used as a parameter  to judge the per- 
formance  of the models.  The following  hyperparameters  were used for 
further FNN training:  the number  of epochs (1‚Äì200),  dropout  (0.001),  
and batch size (5‚Äì30).  Baseline  comparison  of models was performed  
using Support  Vector Regression  (SVM) [63] and RF [64] algorithms  
implemented  in Scikit-learn  v.0.24.2  [65] . The predictive  performance  
of regression  models was evaluated  using correlation  coeÔ¨Écient  ( ùëÖ 2 ), 
root mean square error (RMSE),  and mean absolute  error (MAE) [71] . 
These metrics  were calculated  as follows:  
ùëÖ 2 = 1 ‚àí ‚àëùëõ ùë°ùëíùë†ùë° 
ùëñ =1 ( ùëå ùëúùëèùë† ‚àí ùëå ùëùùëüùëíùëë ) 2

ùëÖùëÄùëÜùê∏  = ‚àö ‚àëùëõ ùë°ùëíùë†ùë°

In the above equations,  ùëå ùëúùëèùë† represents  experimental  pLD 50 value, ùëå ùëùùëüùëíùëë

compounds  in training  and test set, respectively,  and ÃÑùëå ùë°ùëüùëéùëñùëõ is the average  
of experimental  values of the training  set. 2.6. Model interpretation  
Contribution  maps[ 72 , 73 ] were generated  from QSAR models to vi- 
sualize the fragments  and atoms contributing  to acute contact  and oral 
toxicities.  Here, the "weight"  of an atom was considered  as a predicted-  
probability  diÔ¨Äerence  (classiÔ¨Åcation  models)  or pLD 50 diÔ¨Äerence  (re- 
gression  models)  obtained  when the bits in the Ô¨Ångerprint  correspond-  
ing to the atom are removed.  Then, the normalized  weights  were used 
to color the atoms in a topography-like  map in which green indicating  
negative  contribution  for toxicity  (i.e., predicted  probability  or pLD 50 in- 
creases when the bits are removed),  and red indicating  a positive  contri- 
bution for toxicity  (i.e., predicted  probability  or pLD 50 decreases  when 
the bits are removed)  [73] . 
2.7. Model implementation  
The BeeToxAI  web app was implemented  on a multiplatform  frame- 
work with technology  ready to support  large-scale  demands  on mi- 
croservice  serverless  and Kubernetes  environments  [74] . The backend  
serving  makes deploying  new algorithms  and experiments  easy while 
keeping  the same server architecture  and the APIs. The APIs work with 
JSON infrastructure  and permit out-of-the-box  integration  with other 
computer  software  (e.g., KNIME or a custom  front-end).  The main li- 
braries integrated  are Python [58] , RDKit [59] , Scikit-learn  [65] , uWSGI 
[75] , JavaScript  [76] , Flask [77] , Matplolib  [78] , and Seaborn  [79] . 
BeeToxAI  also includes  the JSME molecule  editor written  in JavaScript  
[80] , which is supported  by the most popular  web browsers.  Java or 
Flash plugins  are not required  to use the app. Also, our back and front- 
end use GitLab [81] , CI/CD for Continuous  integration  (CI), Continu-  
ous Delivery  (CDE), and Continuous  Deployment  (CD). The application‚Äôs  
code base is hosted in a Git repository  [82] and, to every push, runs a 
pipeline  of scripts to build, test, validate,  and deploying  your application  
to production.  
3. Results  and discussion  
In the present  study, we integrated  and carefully  compiled  the largest 
collection  of compounds  with acute toxicity  data (LD 50 ) for adult A. mel- 
lifera . The compounds  were divided  into ‚Äúcontact  ‚Äù(File S1) and ‚Äúoral ‚Äù(File
 S2) datasets  according  to the type of bee exposure  during experi- 
mental acute toxicity  assays. A threshold  of 11 ùúág/bee was used to cat- 
egorize  compounds  into toxic ( ‚â§ 11 ùúág/bee)  and nontoxic  ( > 11 ùúág/bee)  
as described  in the US EPA test guidelines  [16] . 
Subsequently,  we carefully  curated  contact  and oral datasets  using 
standard  protocols  [32‚Äì34]  . Data curating  represents  a crucial step for 
building  predictive  QSAR models.  It has been recognized  that genotype  
diÔ¨Äerences  among the 26 recognized  subspecies  of A. mellifera  can di- 
rectly impact the response  to chemicals  [83] . Unfortunately,  subspecies  
information  is not provided  for most chemicals  deposited  in public do- 
main databases.  In addition,  considerable  diÔ¨Äerences  often appear when 
toxicity  tests are performed  by diÔ¨Äerent  laboratories  [84] and when dif- 
ferent colonies  of a single subspecies  are tested in the same laboratory  
[85] . On the other hand, the same compound  may be registered  multiple  
times in the modeling  and external  sets. QSAR models built with datasets  
containing  duplicates  will have low accuracy  if toxicity  outcomes  are 
dissimilar  or overoptimistic  performances  if outcomes  are identical  [34] . 
Despite  this, data curation  procedures  have not been uniformly  applied  
to the development  of some QSAR models [ 29 , 36‚Äì38 ]. 
The number  of compounds  in contact  and oral datasets  is shown in 
Table 1 . After data curation  and duplicate  removal,  the contact  expo- 
sure dataset had 382 compounds  (toxic: 113, nontoxic:  269) while the 
oral exposure  dataset had 169 compounds  (toxic: 71, nontoxic:  98). The 
datasets  were further divided  (Fig. S1) into modeling  (80%) and exter- 
nal (20%) sets. So, 305 compounds  of the contact  dataset were used 
for the model development  while the remaining  77 compounds  (20%) 
were used to validate  the models.  Similarly,  135 compounds  of the oral

pounds  were used to validate  the models.  The overall quality of dataset 
splitting  is shown in Supplementary  Fig. S2, which indicated  that exter- 
nal set compounds  are relatively  distributed  in all regions  of the chem- 
ical space of modeling  set compounds.  
On the other hand, for the datasets  to develop  regression  models,  af- 
ter data curation  and duplicate  removal,  the contact  exposure  dataset 
had 218 compounds  while the oral exposure  dataset had 142 com- 
pounds.  After splitting  the datasets  into modeling  (80%) and external  
(20%) sets, 174 compounds  of the contact  dataset were used for the 
model development  and 44 compounds  were used to validate  the mod- 
els. In the same manner,  114 compounds  of the oral dataset were used 
for model development  and 28 compounds  were used to validate  the 
models.  
3.1. Chemical  space analysis  
The analysis  of chemical  space was performed  by using contact  and 
oral exposure  datasets  and 2044 pesticides  collected  from the Pesti- 
cide Product  Information  System Database  [56] . The analysis  has been 
performed  by plotting  both datasets  separately  against  the pesticide  
database  using similarity  maps ( Fig. 1 ) [57] . 
As shown in Fig. 1 , both datasets  are structurally  diverse,  contain-  
ing smaller  clusters  of similar compounds  (black circles),  and covers all 
regions  of the chemical  space of pesticides.  This Ô¨Ånding  correlates  well 
with our previous  observation  that a broad range of chemical  categories  
(drugs, industrial  use, pesticides,  cosmetics)  have similar structures  and 
that a property  of a compound  depends  on its chemical  structure  and 
not on its industrial  class [86] . 
When analyzing  the outcomes  of the contact  dataset ( Fig. 1 a), it 
was found that most of the toxic and nontoxic  compounds  do not 
share the same clusters,  and similar characteristics  were observed  in 
the oral dataset ( Fig. 1 d). This analysis  shows that both datasets  have 
few toxicity  cliÔ¨Äs (i.e., structurally  similar compounds  with a large dif- 
ference  in toxicity)  [87‚Äì89]  . Representative  compounds  of clusters  1‚Äì3 
from the contact  dataset are shown in Fig. 1 b. Cluster 1 contains  toxic 
pyrethroids;  cluster 2 ‚Äìt o x i c organothiophosphates;  cluster 3 ‚Äìn o n - 
toxic sulfonylureas.  The representative  compounds  of clusters  1‚Äì3 from 
the oral dataset are shown in Fig. 1 d. Cluster 1 contains  toxic phospho-  
nothioates;  cluster 2 ‚Äìtoxic pyrethroids;  cluster 3 ‚Äìnontoxic  azoles. 
3.2. Performance  of classiÔ¨Åcation  models 
A total of 20 classiÔ¨Åcation  models were developed  by a combina-  
tion of two ML methods  (RF and SVM) along with three Ô¨Ångerprint  
sets: MACCS,  FCFP and ECFP (diameter  4: FCFP4, ECFP4;  diameter  8: 
FCFP8, ECFP8).  The statistical  characteristics  of the QSAR models devel- 
oped for acute contact  toxicity  and acute oral toxicity  are summarized  
in Tables S1 and S2. BrieÔ¨Çy,  ACC values ranged between  0.81‚Äì0.89;  
SE = 0.64‚Äì0.82;  SP = 0.81‚Äì0.98,  ùúÖ= 0.58‚Äì0.74;  and MCC = 0.59‚Äì0.75.  The model built using ECFP4 + RF demonstrated  the best internal  per- 
formance  among all other models developed  for acute contact  toxicity  
(ACC = 0.89; SE = 0.70; SP = 0.96; and ùúÖ= 0.71). The model built using 
ECFP4 + SVM demonstrated  the best internal  performance  among mod- 
els developed  for acute oral toxicity  (ACC = 0.87; SE = 0.75; SP = 0.96; 
and ùúÖ= 0.74). 
Furthermore,  the external  sets were used to evaluate  the predictivity  
of the QSAR models.  Because  external  set compounds  were not involved  
in model building,  the resulting  performance  reÔ¨Çects  the ability of the 
models to predict the toxicity  of new compounds.  The results indicate  
that models built using FCFP4 + RF, ECFP4 + RF and ECFP8 + RF (Ta- 
ble S1) showed  the best external  predictivity  among all other models 
developed  for acute contact  toxicity  (ACC = 0.90; SP = 0.98; ùúÖ= 0.73). 
However,  these models have a limited ability to correctly  predict toxic 
compounds  (SE = 0.70). The model developed  using MACCS  + RF (Ta- 
ble S2) showed  the best external  predictivity  among all other models 
developed  for acute oral toxicity  (ACC = 0.88; SE = 0.86; SP = 0.90; 
and ùúÖ= 0.76), suggesting  that this model has a higher accuracy  to sort 
the toxicological  potential  of new compounds.  
3.3. Threshold-moving  calibration  for imbalanced  classiÔ¨Åcation  
To increase  prediction  conÔ¨Ådence  without  losing data, i.e., without  
needing  to balance  the data, we tried threshold-moving  calibration  of 
probability  estimates  [90] . Mechanistically,  classiÔ¨Åcation  models also 
output a continuous  value as the probability  of a given case belonging  
to a output class. The probabilities  can be interpreted  as the likelihood  
or conÔ¨Ådence  of a given case belonging  to each class. Here, classiÔ¨Å-  
cation models were trained  independently  using acute contact  and oral 
datasets  to distinguish  toxic vs. nontoxic  compounds.  Usually,  predicted  
probabilities  values less than 0.5 are assigned  to the class of nontoxic  
compounds  and values greater than or equal to 0.5 are assigned  to the 
class of toxic compounds.  However,  QSAR models developed  for classiÔ¨Å-  
cation using imbalanced  data usually  provide  poor probability  estimates  
( < 0.5) for the minority  class [ 91 , 92 ]. In view of this, diÔ¨Äerent  proba- 
bility thresholds  in a range between  0 and 1 were explored  to Ô¨Ånd the 
optimal  threshold  that reÔ¨Çects  the best performance.  Details of statis- 
tical performances  of calibrated  models for acute contact  toxicity  and 
acute oral toxicity  are summarized  in Tables S3 and S4, respectively.  In 
general,  the threshold-moving  led to signiÔ¨Åcant  improvements  in statis- 
tical performance  of these QSAR models ( Fig. 2 a). As shown in Table 2 
and Fig. 2a , changing  the threshold  from 0.5 to 0.32 improved  the ACC 
( + 4%), MCC ( + 14%), and ùúÖ( + 16%) of the FCFP4 + SVM model devel- 
oped for acute contact  toxicity.  Based on this, the adjusted  probability  
threshold  obtained  for this model was kept as the Ô¨Ånal model for the 
prediction  of acute contact  toxicity  of new compounds.  
The performance  of the acute oral toxicity  models was also investi-  
gated after threshold-moving  calibration,  although  they were generated  
using a dataset with a similar ratio of toxic and nontoxic  compounds  
(1:1.4).  The statistical  characteristics  of calibrated  models developed  
for acute oral toxicity  are shown in Tables 2 and S4. According  to the 
radar plot ( Fig. 2 b), the threshold-moving  calibration  did not lead to ap- 
parent improvements  in the internal  and external  performances  of these 
models.  Consequently,  threshold-moving  calibration  was not used as ad- 
justing parameters  for predicting  acute oral toxicity  of new compounds.  
From the statistical  point of view, our modeling  approach  enabled  
the development  of externally  predictive  classiÔ¨Åcation  models.  How- 
ever, building  QSAR models trained  with small datasets  of compounds  
must always be considered  delicate,  since it may suÔ¨Äer from various  
deÔ¨Åciencies  like inconsistent  classiÔ¨Åcations  for chemicals  outside  AD. 
Furthermore,  mechanistic  interpretation  of these models may be chal- 
lenging  given the sum of a plethora  of toxicological  mechanisms,  each 
involving  diÔ¨Äerent  biochemical  pathways  concurring  to the Ô¨Ånal eÔ¨Äect.

3.4. Performance  of regression  models 
Following  the results from the former section,  we developed  regres- 
sion models using FNNs aiming to predict pLD 50 values for acute contact  
and acute oral toxicities  on honey bees. We evaluated  the combination  
of diÔ¨Äerent  FNN conÔ¨Ågurations  and hyperparameters  for both acute con- 
tact and acute oral datasets.  The best performance  was determined  based 
on the best balance  between  ùëÖ 2 and RMSE. The tested hyperparameters  
and their respective  inÔ¨Çuence  on model performance  are shown in Fig. 3 . 
Initially,  we assessed  diÔ¨Äerent  number  of hidden layers for each dataset,  
since depth has a large impact on the model complexity  and can lead 
to overÔ¨Åtting  of models.  As we can see in Fig. 3 a,b, Ô¨Åve hidden layers 
showed  the best results for the acute contact  toxicity  model, while six 
hidden layers improved  the performance  for acute oral toxicity  model. 
In addition,  ReLU activation  function  showed  the best results among all 
tested functions  ( Fig. 3 c,d). In addition,  batch sizes of 20 and 15 showed  
the best performances  for the acute contact  and acute oral models,  re- 
spectively  ( Fig. 3 e,f). 
After the Ô¨Ånding  of the best combinations,  we found that most pre- 
dictive acute contact  model ( ùëÖ 2 = 0.75, RMSE = 0.39, and MAE = 0.32) 
was generated  using Ô¨Åve hidden layers, decreasing  the number  of neu- 
rons in the subsequent  hidden layer [512, 256, 128, 16, and 4, respec- 
tively ( Fig. 3 g)], the ReLU activation  function,  batch size of 20, and 
199 epochs.  On the other hand, the best acute oral model ( ùëÖ 2 = 0.75, 
RMSE = 0.68, and MAE = 0.53) was generated  using six hidden lay- 
ers, decreasing  the number  of neurons  in the subsequent  hidden layer 
[512, 256, 128, 64, 32, and 16, respectively  ( Fig. 3 h)], the ReLU activa- 
tion function,  batch size of 15, and 142 epochs.  We also trained  RF and 
SVR methods  using ECFP4 Ô¨Ångerprints  as baseline  models to examine  
dataset modelability.  SVR algorithm  advantages  in modeling  nonlinear  problems  [63] , whereas  RF attracts  much interest  in QSAR studies be- 
cause it is not sensitive  to the hyperparameters  [64] . For both acute tox- 
icity endpoints,  regression  models based on optimized  FNNs (R 2 ‚â• 0.75) 
showed  superior  performance  over RF and SVR (R 2 ‚â§ 0.41) models,  indi- 
cating that modeled  datasets  do not have easily distinguishable  patterns  
and are not biased. 
3.5. Comparison  with publicly  available  models 
3.5.1. ClassiÔ¨Åcation  models 
Several  classiÔ¨Åcation  methods  have been developed  to assess 
chemical-induced  acute toxicity  on honey bees, and thus a comparison  
of their statistical  performances  is shown in Table 3 . 
Overall,  the classiÔ¨Åcation  models reported  in this study (ACC = 0.91, 
MCC = 0.78) showed  higher performance  compared  with those gen- 
erated by Como et al. (ACC = 0.84, MCC = 0.67) [37] , Venko et al. 
(ACC = 0.77, MCC = 0.48) [38] , Wang et al. (ACC = 0.83, MCC = 0.59) 
[29] , Li et al. (ACC = 0.90, MCC = 0.76) [39] , and Singh et al. 
(ACC = 0.87 and 0.89 for classiÔ¨Åcation  and multi-class  classiÔ¨Åcation,  
respectively)  [36] . On the other hand, our model showed  statistical  per- 
formance  comparable  with QSAR developed  by Carnesecchi  et al. [93] . 
(ACC = 0.90, MCC = 0.78). Nonetheless,  it is noteworthy  that these com- 
parisons  should not be interpreted  rigorously,  as diÔ¨Äerent  compositions  
and sizes of the training  and test sets were used to build models.  In ad- 
dition, Carnesecchi  et al. [30] . developed  externally  predictive  QSAR 
models to assess the acute contact  toxicity  of mixtures  to honey bees 
( ùëÖ 2 = 0.89), and the nature of combined  synergic/non-synergic  toxicity  
(ACC = 0.96, MCC = 0.90). Although  these models may contribute  to 
Ô¨Åll part of the gaps in toxicological  assessment  in honey bees, it is not 
suitable  to compare  them with our active ingredient-based  models,  since

3.5.2. Regression  models 
A comparison  of predictive  performances  of our regression  models 
with publicly  available  models is shown in Table 4 . Again, a rigorous  
comparison  with previous  models reported  in the literature  is not fea- 
sible due to diÔ¨Äerent  compositions  of the training  and test sets. De- 
spite that, the best model developed  for acute contact  toxicity  presented  
lower error on test set compared  to the model developed  by Hamadache  
et al. (RMSE = 0.71) [94] , Carnesecchi  et al. (RMSE = 0.71) [93] , and 
Toropov  and Benfenati  (RMSE = 0.68) [95] , while the best model de- 
veloped  for acute oral toxicity  presented  comparable  statistical  perfor- 
mance with them. On the other hand, the best model developed  for 
acute contact  toxicity  showed  comparable  statistical  performance  with 
the models developed  by Devillers  et al. (RMSE = 0.39) [96] and Singh 
et al. (RMSE = 0.33) [36] , Although  our models presented  higher errors 
on the test set compared  to the model of Dulin et al. (RMSE = 0.218),  their number  of compounds  on the test set ( n = 6) could overestimate  
the external  performance  of this model. Mukherjee  et al. [97] . did not 
calculate  the RMSE metric of their model. Compared  to Mukherjee  et al. 
[97] . work ( ùëÖ 2 = 0.666),  we have modeled  a more structurally  repre- 
sentative  dataset of chemicals  that allowed  us obtain more predictive  
models ( ùëÖ 2 = 0.75). 
3.6. The BeeToxAI  usage 
The most predictive  classiÔ¨Åcation  and regression  models for acute 
contact  and oral toxicity  were implemented  in the BeeToxAI  web app 
( http://beetoxai.labmol.com.br/  ). The BeeToxAI  has an intuitive  user 
interface  ( Fig. 4 ), in which the user may draw a compound  of interest  
in the ‚Äúmolecular  editor ‚Äùbox or directly  paste the SimpliÔ¨Åed  Molecular  
Input Line Entry SpeciÔ¨Åcation  (SMILES)  string of the queried  chemi- 
cal structure.  After hitting the ‚ÄúSubmit  Analysis  ‚Äù button,  the user will 
receive  the classiÔ¨Åcation  outcomes  (e.g., toxic, nontoxic)  using the best 
classiÔ¨Åcation  models developed  for acute contact  and oral toxicities.  Are

also showed  predicted  probability  values, which are useful for estimat-  
ing the conÔ¨Ådence  of classiÔ¨Åcation  outcomes  [70] . When a compound  is 
classiÔ¨Åed  as toxic by acute contact  or oral toxicity  classiÔ¨Åcation  model, 
then the prediction  by the respective  regression  model is activated  and 
the predicted  LD 50 is displayed  on the screen. All predictions  are fol- 
lowed by the AD estimates  and mechanistic  interpretation  using color- 
coded maps of fragment  contribution  [ 72 , 73 ]. For the maps, atoms or 
fragments  promoting  positive  toxicity  contributions  are highlighted  in 
red, while structural  moieties  decreasing  the toxicity  are highlighted  in 
green. Also, the predicted  pLD 50 is shown on the respective  contribution  
map. 3.7. Case study using BeeToxAI  
In order to carry out an additional  statistical  validation  of the Bee- 
ToxAI app, we compiled  and prepared  a list of 8 additional  pesticides  
(not included  in the QSAR datasets)  with honey bee contact  and/or oral 
LD 50 data used in the United States from 1992 to 2014 (Table S5). Then, 
we used BeeToxAI  to predict these pesticides‚Äô  contact  and oral toxicity  
potential  to honey bees ( Figs. 5 and 6 ). 
According  to the results of BeeToxAI  ( Figs. 5 and 6 ), the acute oral 
toxicity  classiÔ¨Åcation  model correctly  classiÔ¨Åed  four out of Ô¨Åve pesti- 
cides (three of the listed pesticides  did not have experimental  data on 
acute oral toxicity)  and the acute contact  toxicity  classiÔ¨Åcation  model 
correctly  classiÔ¨Åed  all of the eight pesticides.  The pesticide  incorrectly  
classiÔ¨Åed  by the acute oral toxicity  classiÔ¨Åcation  model was correctly  
predicted  by the respective  regression  model. These results corroborate  
with the high external  predictive  power reported  above. On the other 
hand, two compounds  were erroneously  predicted  by the acute contact  
toxicity  regression  model. Most of the incorrect  predictions  were out- 
side of the model AD. Therefore,  the analysis  of predictions  using Bee- 
ToxAI should be cautious  when considering  chemicals  outside  the DA, 
since the classiÔ¨Åcation  and regression  models were trained  using small 
datasets.  
All predictions  are accompanied  by color-coded  maps of fragment  
contributions  to toxicity  ( Figs. 5 and 6 ). These contribution  maps esti- 
mate the weight of single fragments  or atoms to toxicity  by removing  
them from the structure  and calculating  the diÔ¨Äerence  between  the pre- 
dicted values for the initial structure  and the structure  with a removed  
fragment.  This enables  estimation  of the contributions  of whole frag- 
ments (functional  groups,  scaÔ¨Äolds,  linkers)  as well as their combined

eÔ¨Äect if two or more groups are removed  simultaneously  from the struc- 
ture [73] . 
Overall,  contribution  maps from BeeToxAI  allow the user to analyze  
the individual  contribution  of each fragment  for acute oral toxicity  and 
contact  toxicity.  In addition,  the AD and prediction  probabilities  pro- 
vide further context  to the model outputs  that allow for estimates  of 
overall conÔ¨Ådence.  Other existing  models do not provide  this degree of 
mechanistic  interpretation  [ 29 , 36‚Äì39 , 93 ]. Mechanistic  interpretation  of 
predictions  reported  here can lead to such additional  beneÔ¨Åts  as (i) elic- 
itation of structural  alerts; (ii) insights  on the mode of action; and (iii) 
utility to chemists  who want to modify the molecule  [ 99 , 100 ]. BeeToxAI  
indicated  the signiÔ¨Åcant  contribution  of several fragments  for toxicity,  
including  phosphinates  (see fenamiphos  acute oral toxicity  map, Fig. 5 ) 
and phosphonates  (see oxydemeton-methyl  and phosphamidon  maps, 
Fig. 6 ). In view of this, we overcame  an inherent  trade-oÔ¨Äbetween  pre- 
dictive performance  and interpretability  that has been traditionally  as- 
sumed [101] , implementing  highly predictive  and interpretable  QSAR 
models in BeeToxAI.  
4. Conclusion  
In this work, we developed  and rigorously  validated  classiÔ¨Åcation  
and regression  QSAR models that accurately  predict acute contact  and 
oral toxicities  of chemicals  to honey bees. Benchmarking  with existing  
computational  tools demonstrated  superior  or comparable  performance.  
In addition,  we implemented  a visual algorithm  that facilitates  model interpretation.  These models were implemented  in the BeeToxAI  web 
app ‚Äìa fast, reliable,  and user-friendly  tool for the assessment  of acute 
chemical  toxicity  to honey bees. Users can make predictions  using rigor- 
ously and externally  validated  computational  models that fulÔ¨Åll all the 
OECD principles  for developing  and validating  QSAR models for regu- 
latory purposes.  The web app does not require  any prior knowledge  of 
programming  or computational  skills for its utilization.  The predictions  
for a single compound  take only a few seconds.  
Furthermore,  BeeToxAI  provides  the user with the following  out- 
comes: (i) toxic/nontoxic  classiÔ¨Åcation  for acute contact  toxicity  and 
acute oral toxicity  honey bees endpoints;  (ii) conÔ¨Ådence  of the pre- 
dictions;  (iii) applicability  domain  estimation;  and (iv) color-coded  
contribution  maps illustrating  the relative  contribution  of chemical  
fragments  for toxicity.  The web app, designed  to openly share the 
aforementioned  predictive  models,  is freely available  to the public at 
http://beetoxai.labmol.com.br/  . We propose  these models as a valu- 
able contribution  to the scientiÔ¨Åc  community  that enables  regulators  
and regulated  companies  to rapidly  evaluate  the risk of chemical  harm 
to honey bees ( Apis mellifera)  for the registration  of the new pesticides.  
Future directions  of the BeeToxAI  include  the implementation  of Quan- 
titative  Activity-Activity  Relationships  (QAAR)  [102] , Mode of Action 
(MoA) predictors,  multi-task  (species)  models,  and read-across  (nearest  
neighbors)  [23] . In this context,  the ongoing  BeeToxAI  project aims to 
implement  new predictive  models to assess the acute toxicity  of active 
ingredients  and mixtures  [30] against  multiple  stages (adult and larvae) 
of honey bees and bumble  bees.
