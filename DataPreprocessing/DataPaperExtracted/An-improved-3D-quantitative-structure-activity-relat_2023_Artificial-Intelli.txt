Ligand-based  virtual screening  plays an important  role for cases in which protein structures  are not available.  Among ligand-based  methods,  accurate  and fast 
prediction  of protein-ligand  binding aﬃnity is crucial for reducing  computational  cost and exploring  the chemical  search space eﬃciently.  Here we proposed  a CNN- 
based method,  termed as L3D-PLS  for building  the quantitative  structure-activity  relationships  without target structures.  In L3D-PLS,  a CNN module was designed  
for extracting  the key interaction  features  from the grids around aligned ligands, and a partial least square (PLS) model ﬁts the binding aﬃnity with the extracted  
features  of the pre-trained  CNN module.  In 30 publicly  available  pre-aligned  molecular  datasets,  L3D-PLS  outperformed  the traditional  CoMFA method.  This results 
highlight  that L3D-PLS  can be useful for lead optimization  based on small datasets  which is often true in drug discovery  compaign.  
Introduction  
Ligand-based  virtual screening,  one of the commonly  used computer-  
aided drug discovery  approaches  [1] , has become  routine  process  for 
lead identiﬁcation,  lead optimization  and scaﬀold  hopping.  Among  lig- 
and based methods,  quantitative  structure-active  relationships  (QSAR)  
analysis  aims to ﬁnd the statistically  signiﬁcant  correlations  between  a 
series of molecular  structures  and their associated  biological  properties  
[2] , guide the optimization  of lead series. 
Conventional  QSAR models are built usually  using molecular  physic- 
ochemical  properties/descriptors  [3] , composition  of speciﬁc  substruc-  
tures or force ﬁeld based interaction  energies  etc. Many statistic  meth- 
ods including  multiple-linear  regression  (MLR) [4] , principal  component  
analysis  (PCA) [5] , principal  component  regression  (PCR) [6] , partial 
least square (PLS) [7] are employed  for ﬁtting those descriptors  against  
the biological  activities  or DMPK properties  [8] . The common  workﬂow  
of QSAR model can be described  in Fig. 1 . 
There are usually  two scenarios  in predicting  ligand-protein  binding  
aﬃnity,  one is the type of method  that employs  physics  based simulation  
using protein-ligand  complex  structures,  like FEP [9] , thermodynamic  
integration  [10] or umbrella  sampling  methods  [11] . Derived  from sta- 
tistical mechanics,  these methods  could provide  accurate  estimation  of 
protein-ligand  binding  aﬃnity  with expensive  complex-structure  sam- 
pling computations.  For example,  FEP + shows considerable  correlations  
between  calculated  and experimental  relative  binding  free energies,  and 
average  errors in the range of only 1 kcal/mol  [12] . Although  available  
protein  structures  have increased  dramatically  in recent decades,  for 
some targets such as ion channels,  getting target structure  information

compaigns  target structure  information  is missing.  In the other type of 
scenario,  one has to rely on ligand based method  to estimate  ligand bind- 
ing aﬃnitywhich  also called quantitative  structure-activity  relationships  
modeling  (QSAR),  Although  historically  some 2D based QSAR methods  
have been proposed  [13] , such as Free-Wilson  [14] , Hansh-Fujita  meth- 
ods [15] and fragment  based QSAR models propsed  by Klopman,.3D  
based QSAR models using molecular  interaction  ﬁeld (MIF) [16] can 
provide  chemical  insights  regarding  the relationship  between  3D based 
molecular  properties  and biological  activities.  However,  the biological  
properties  of a compound  are the function  of its three dimensional  struc- 
ture, therefore  these methods  still suﬀer from limitations  due to the lack 
of 3D ligand structural  information  [17] , which otherwise  can provide  
explicitly  guidelines  for medicinal  chemists  to elucidate  ligand binding  
mode, and modify chemical  structures  for improving  biological  activity.  
To address  this problem,  comparative  molecular  ﬁeld analysis  (CoMFA)  
method  was the ﬁrst and commonly  used attempt  to unitize the 3D spa- 
tial information  in QSAR modeling  [18] . 
In CoMFA,  a series of probe atoms are introduced  to describe  3D fea- 
tures of a ligand by calculating  the electrostatic  and steric interaction  
energies  between  probe atom and ligand on the 3D lattice surround-  
ing molecules.  The PLS method  is further used to extract the relation-  
ships between  molecular  interaction  ﬁeld (MIF) and biological  activity.  
Following  CoMFA  method,  other 3D QSAR methods  like CoMSIA  [19] , 
EVA [20] , WHIM [21] also proposed  in bridging  the molecular  structure  
and bio-activity.  These 3D QSAR models require  selection  of a template  
conformation  which mimicks  the bioactive  conformation  of ligand and 
pre-alignment  of all template  conformations.  One diﬃculty  that these

methods  suﬀer from is the variable  selection  among thousands  of inter- 
action features  on the 3D grid. 
Recent decades,  it has been seen that machine  learning  technolo-  
gies have brought  new directions  into the ﬁeld of QSAR in the form of 
supervised,  unsupervised,  semi-supervised  learning,  especially  on accu- 
rate prediction  of binding  aﬃnity  [22] . Early attempts  include  intro- 
duction  of models like linear regression  [23] , kernel ridge regression  
[24] , support  vector machine  [25] and random  forest [26] to improve  
the accuracy  of predictions.  For example,  a random-forest  regression  
model, RF-score  [27] , was proposed  to predict protein-ligand  binding  
aﬃnity.  With recent development  of deep learning  (DL) methods,  exam- 
ples like RosENet  [28] , GAT-Score  [29] tried to introduce  CNN (convo-  
lutional  neural network)  model or graph neural network  [30] to extract 
structural  features  of protein-ligand  complex  structures  and greatly im- 
prove the prediction  accuracy  of protein-ligand  binding  aﬃnity  [31] . 
One unique feature of DL based method  is that they can handle large 
input features  and can carry out automatic  feature extraction.  Although  
DL based methods  have been applied  for study of protein-ligand  interac-  
tion, there still lack of research  on applying  DL method  on ligand based 
3D QSAR model, this maybe due to the fact that the size of ligand based 
QSAR datasets  is usually  small. 
Here, we propose  a new grid-based  3D QSAR method,  L3D-PLS  for 
modeling  protein-ligand  binding  aﬃnity  based on ligand information  
only. In L3D-PLS,  a CNN module  was designed  for deriving  ligand elec- 
trostatic  and steric potential  related features  from the multi-channel  
3D grid information  of pre-aligned  ligands  and a partial least squares  
(PLS) model ﬁts the binding  aﬃnity  with the output of the pre-trained  
CNN module.  In a series of 30 publicly  available  pre-aligned  molecular  
datasets,  L3D-PLS  outperformed  the traditional  CoMFA  method  
Methods  
A. L3D-PLS  workﬂow  
The whole work-ﬂow  for L3D-PLS  model is shown in Fig. 2 . Firstly, 
the aligned  molecules  go through  a preparation  procedure  to standard-  
ize molecular  positions  to make sure they are rotation  and translation  
invariance.  The origin of the coordinate  system are moved to the geo- 
metric center of the aligned  conformations  and the XYZ axes are also 
rotated  to align with the principal  axes of the conformation  set. Sec- 
ondly, a grid box is created  to encircle  the whole aligned  conformation  
set with certain step size, then a set of probe atoms walked  through  the 
grids for calculating  the interaction  energies  between  the probe atom 
and every molecule  on each grid point. Once the energy based features  
are collected  for the molecules,  multi-layer  CNN model is used for fea- ture extraction  from the multi-channel  grid information  and a PLS mod- 
ule are involved  to correlate  the CNN derived  features  with bioactivity  
data. 
B. Dataset and the standard  orientation  
Altogether  30 publicly  available  datasets  were used for model evalu- 
ation and were downloaded  from PyCoMFA  website  [32] . These datasets  
were used by PyCoMFA  program  which is a python version  of CoMFA  
model and in each dataset,  all molecules  were pre-aligned.  To make 
sure models are not aﬀected  by the initial rotation  and translation,  all 
the molecular  structures  in each dataset went through  a standardization  
process.  The origin of the coordinate  system were ﬁrst moved to the ge- 
ometric  center of the whole conformation  set and then rotated  to align 
with the principal  axes of the conformation  set. The orientation  vector 
{ 𝛼, 𝛽, 𝛾} of principal  axises against  original  axis is obtained  by doing 
PCA analysis  of the whole set of molecular  coordinates  C as shown in 
Eq (1) . 
{ 𝛼, 𝛽, 𝛾} = 𝐹 𝑃𝐶𝐴 ( 𝑪 ) (1) 
Then the rotated  coordinates  𝐶 ′𝑖 of i th molecules  can be obtained  
with Eq (2) . 
𝐶 ′
𝑖 = ( 𝐶 0 
𝑖 − 𝐶 𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑠 ) 𝑅 𝑋 ( 𝛼) 𝑅 𝑌 ( 𝛽) 𝑅 𝑧 ( 𝛾) 
= ( 𝐶 0 
𝑖 − 𝐶 𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑠 ) ⎡

⎢ 
⎢ ⎣ cos 𝛾− 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝛾0

⎥ 
⎥ ⎦ (2) 
Where 𝐶 0 
𝑖 represents  the original  coordinates  of ith molecule,  𝑅 𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑠 is 
the geometric  center of molecule  sets. 
C. Generation  of molecular  interaction  ﬁeld grids 
Generation  of molecular  interaction  ﬁeld (MIF) grids of pre-aligned  
molecules  are same as CoMFA  methods  [33] , derived  from semi- 
empirical  free capacity  ﬁeld embedding  in Autogrid  [4] . Eight types 
of probe atom, including  𝐻 ∗ , 𝐻𝐷 ∗ , 𝐶 ∗ , 𝐴 ∗ , 𝑁 ∗ , 𝑁𝐴 ∗ , 𝑂𝐴 ∗ and 𝑆𝐴 ∗ , are 
used by default,  as illustrated  in Table 1 . The interactions  between  probe 
atom i and molecule  atom j are as shown in Eq (3) ∼Eq (5) .

and m are the coeﬃcients  in Autogrid  [4] . The MIF grid data are calcu- 
lated in a lattice box with size of 30 Åand interval  of 0.375 Å. 
D. L3D-PLS  model construction  
In current  study, besides  the L3D-PLS  model, another  model L3D- 
MLP was also created  for comparison.  The model architectures  are de- 
picted in Fig. 3 . 
As seen in Fig. 3 , altogether  seven convolutional  layers and two 
dense layers are used for processing  grid data to generate  embedding  
features.  The size of convolutional  kernels  of seven 3D convolutional  
layers are 128, 256, 512, 1024, 512, 128 and 256 respectively.  The 
model output is p 𝐼𝐶 50 value of compound.  For the L3D-MLP  model, 
six extra dense layers (i.e. the MLP block) were added to correlate  with 
bioactivity  data, while in the L3D-PLS  model, a PLS model replaced  the MLP block to predict bioactivity.  For both models,  the mean standard  
error (MSE) of pIC 50 was used as the loss function  as following:  
𝐿𝑜𝑠𝑠 = 𝑀 𝑆𝐸 (
𝑝𝐼 𝐶 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑐𝑡 
50 , 𝑝𝐼 𝐶 𝑟𝑒𝑓𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒  
50 )
(6) 
In this work, Pytorch  framework  was applied  to build the CNN 
model, the PLS code of this workﬂow  is from Scikit-learn  python pack- 
age. 
E. model evaluation  
The composition  of benchmark  datasets  is listed in Table 2 . The per- 
formance  of L3D-PLS  on 30 diﬀerent  publicly  available  datasets  is eval- 
uated with correlation  coeﬃcient  𝑅 2 and cross-validated  𝑄 2 . For a set 
of predicts  𝑦 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑 and references  𝑦 𝑟𝑒𝑓 , 𝑅 2 and 𝑄 2 are both deﬁned  as shown 
in Eq (7) : 
𝑅 2 = 1 − ∑
( 𝑦 𝑟𝑒𝑓 − 𝑦 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑 ) 2 ∕ ∑
( 𝑦 𝑟𝑒𝑓 − 𝑦 𝑟𝑒𝑓 ) 2 
(7) 
The 𝑅 2 was calculated  for compounds  in test set, however,  for small 
benchmark  datasets  like AT2, a 5-fold cross-validation  was performed,  
and 𝑄 2 on cross-validation  was calculated  to evaluate  the model perfor- 
mance.  
For training  the L3D-PLS  model, the input of last dense layer of 
the L3D-MLP  model was taken as the input descriptor  and the PLS 
model was then trained  with the descriptors,  in which the MSE Loss 
in Eq (6) was used. Both the L3D-PLS  and L3D-MLP  were trained  with 
the piece-wise  constant  attenuation  of learning  rate decay scheme  and 
Adam optimizer.  ReLU activation  function  was used in the model.

of calculating  molecular  ﬁeld on 3D grid which was adopted  in CoMFA  
method  and the deep neural network  approach.  The 3D based features  
of small molecules  structures  can be derived  by applying  convolutional  
neural network  on the 3D molecular  ﬁeld data and they are ﬁt with 
the binding  aﬃnities.  But the interaction  data derived  from 3D grid and 
molecular  conformations  is rotational,  and translational  variant.  So we 
ﬁrst examine  how the translation  and rotation  operation  can aﬀect the 
model quality.  
In order to verify the eﬀect of rotation  on the binding  aﬃnity  pre- 
dictions,  we built L3D-PLS  and L3D-MLP  models on BZR dataset as an 
example  case when the aligned  conformations  were rotated  around Z- 
axis from 0°to 360°with  step interval  of 20°, while the grids are ﬁxed. 
The model performance  is shown in Table 3 . When a molecule  is ro- 
tated round Z-axis with torsion of 𝜙, the rotation  matrix is represented  
as shown in Eq (8) :( Fig. 4 ) 
𝑅 𝑧 ( 𝜑 ) = ⎡ 
⎢ 
⎢ ⎣ cos 𝜑 − 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜑 0 
𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜑 𝑐𝑜𝑠𝜑 0 
0 0 1 ⎤ 
⎥ 
⎥ ⎦ (8) 
So the new molecular  coordinates  C’ after rotation  can be computed  
as Eq (9) . 
𝐶 ′= 𝐶 0 ×𝑅 𝑧 ( 𝜑 ) (9) 
where 𝐶 0 is the original  coordinate.  Table 3

As it can be seen in Table 3 , due to the fact that 3D-CNN  is not 
rotation  invariance,  the rotation  of small molecules  in the grid space 
has clearly aﬀected  the accuracy  of model quality.  In addition,  we also 
studied  the eﬀect of translation  of molecules  in the grid box on the result

by simply increase  all conformations  1 Åa l o n g  the X axis in lattice, 
the result is as shown in Table 4 . There, slightly  decrease  of prediction  
accuracy  is observed,  indicating  the 3D-CNN  based feature extraction  
may not be that sensitive  on translation.  
The inﬂuence  of the size of grid box on accuracy  of model prediction  
was also examined.  The size of grid box was changed  and models were 
built on three diﬀerent  datasets  and the results can be seen in Table 5 . 
It seems that when the size increased  from 51 Åt o 61 Å, its accuracy  
slightly  decreases  in general,  which means too large box is not good for 
CNN-based  feature extraction.  
B. The performance  of L3D-PLS  on 30 datasets  
To address  the rotation  and translation  variance  mentioned  above, 
we designed  a standard  preparation  step to make the aligned  molecules  
rotational  and translational  invariance  as discribed  in the method  part. 
We compared  the performance  of three QSAR models including  Py- 
CoMFA,  L3D-MLP  and L3D-PLS.  The 𝑅 2 between  predictions  and ref- 
erences  on 20 test sets are shown in Table 6 . L3D-PLS  performed  best in 10 datasets,  PyCoMFA  and L3D-MLP  had 
best performance  on 7 and 3 datasets,  respectively.  Comparing  with Py- 
CoMFA  model alone on these 20 benchmarks,  L3D-MLP  and L3D-PLS  
show superior  performance  on 10 and 12 datasets.  
For other benchmark  datasets  without  available  test sets, the per- 
formance  of three QSAR models were evaluated  through  𝑄 2 in 5-fold 
cross validation  and the results are listed in Table 7 . Similarly,  L3D-PLS  
models performed  best among 6 of 10 models,  while PyCoMFA  and L3D- 
MLP models give best result on three and one datasets,  respectively.  The 
poor performance  of a L3D-MLP  model reﬂects  the limitation  of deep- 
learning  methods  on small datasets,  while the combination  of 3D-CNN  
and PLS method  out-performed  the traditional  CoMFA  method,  indicat-  
ing the advantages  of 3D-CNN  method  in catching  the key interaction  
features  from high-dimensional  data. 
The performance  of L3D-PLS  model on the 9 datasets  in terms 
of mean absolute  error (MAE) and root mean square error also out- 
performed  L3D-MLP  and PyCoMFA  mdoel, in which L3D-PLS  model 
achieved  better performance  among 8 of 9 benchmark  datasets  (as listed 
in Table S1). The average  of RMSE and MAE of L3D-PLS  is 0.366 and 
0.283, both outperforms  than PyCoMFA  and L3D-MLP.  We also per- 
formed  the Wilcoxon  signed-rank  test to verify the statistically  advan- 
tages of L3D-PLS.  In the test between  RMSE results of PyCoMFA  and 
L3D-MLP,  the p-value  is 0. 017, while it is 0.028 for MAE results.  and 
it is 0.05 and 0.07 in the test between  L3D-PLS  and L3D-MLP  for RMSE 
and MAE results,  respectively.  It indicates  a statistically  advantages  of 
L3D-PLS.  The correlation  between  experimental  p 𝐼𝐶 50 values and L3D- 
PLS predictions,  PyCoMFA,  L3D-MLP  on these random  selected  datasets  
are depicted  in Fig. 5 , S2 and S3.

Conclusions  
In current  study, 3D-CNN  model is proposed  to derive spatial and 
electrostatic  features  for pre-aligned  small molecules  through  multi- 
channel  grids, these features  are then combined  with PLS algorithm  
to ﬁt bioactivity  data. This methodology  is useful for carrying  out 3D 
QSAR study when target information  is not available,  and it has been 
applied  on 30 publicly  available  molecular  datasets.  Two variants  L3D- 
MLP, L3D-PLS  models were built and compared  with the traditional  3D 
QSAR method,  CoMFA.  Our results show that L3D-PLS  model perform  
best, while L3D-MLP  model perform  worse than CoMFA  method.  The 
poor performance  of the L3D-MLP  may be due to the fact that all the 
30 datasets  are not big dataset,  so that deep learning  method  doesn’t 
demonstrate  it advantage.  Anyhow,  the L3D-PLS  model, which com- 
bines 3D-CNN  based feature extraction  and PLS based linear correlation  
technology,  demonstrated  improved  results.  The interpretability  of L3D- 
PLS is limited by its convolution  mechanism.  Although  the contributions  
of a chemical  group on pIC50 can be estimated  from the diﬀerence  be- tween original  ligands  and analogs  without  this chemical  group, it’s still 
diﬃcult  to privide pharmocophore  informations  from single predictions.  
This method  is still useful for building  3D QSAR model on small datasets  
when only ligand information  is avaliable.  And in next steps, graph at- 
tention  mechanism  will be introduced  to improve  the interpretability.
