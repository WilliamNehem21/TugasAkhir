Drug repositioning  a b s t r a c t 
Despite available  vaccinations  COVID-19  case numbers  around the world are still growing,  and eﬀective  medi- 
cations against severe cases are lacking. In this work, we developed  a machine  learning  model which predicts  
mortality  for COVID-19  patients  using data from the multi-center  ‘Lean European  Open Survey on SARS-CoV-  
2-infected  patients’  (LEOSS)  observational  study ( > 100 active sites in Europe, primarily  in Germany),  resulting  
into an AUC of almost 80%. We showed that molecular  mechanisms  related to dementia,  one of the relevant  
predictors  in our model, intersect  with those associated  to COVID-19.  Most notably,  among these molecules  was 
tyrosine  kinase 2 (TYK2), a protein that has been patented  as drug target in Alzheimer’s  Disease but also genet- 
ically associated  with severe COVID-19  outcomes.  We experimentally  veriﬁed that anti-cancer  drugs Sorafenib  
and Regorafenib  showed a clear anti-cytopathic  eﬀect in Caco2 and VERO-E6  cells and can thus be regarded  as 
potential  treatments  against COVID-19.  Altogether,  our work demonstrates  that interpretation  of machine  learn- 
ing based risk models can point towards  drug targets and new treatment  options,  which are strongly  needed for 
COVID-19.  
1. Introduction

considerable  number  of infected  people worldwide.  Moreover,  eﬀective  
medications  for treating  severe cases are still scarce. Remdesivir,  a drug 
originally  developed  against  the Ebola virus, is currently  the only ap- 
proved COVID-19  drug in the European  Union, and evidence  suggests  
that it has little eﬀect on the overall survival  of COVID-19  patients  [5] . 
Several  studies have revealed  general  risk factors for a poor dis- 
ease outcome,  such as age, male gender,  and low platelet  count 
[ 20 , 42 , 46 , 65 ]. In addition,  machine  learning  (ML) models have been 
published  to predict mortality  risk for individual  patients,  primarily  
based on data from Intensive  Care Units and electronic  health records  
from the US and UK [ 3 , 6 , 19 , 31 , 48 , 53 , 57 ] as well as a few other coun- 
tries [ 33 , 39 ]. Notably  the 4C mortality  score developed  by Ali et al., 
based on data from the UK has recently  been validated  within an in- 
tendent  study in Canada  [31] . None of these models have resulted  in a 
change of clinical  routine  or the identiﬁcation  of new treatment  options  
so far. 
In this work, we speciﬁcally  investigated  data from nearly 5700 PCR 
or rapid test conﬁrmed  SARS-CoV-2  patients  recruited  in more than 100 
European  active sites, primarily  all over Germany.  For these patients,  
disease  symptoms,  vital parameters,  biomarkers  from urine and blood, 
and diagnosed  comorbidities  were available.  Using these data and ML, 
we ﬁrst developed  a model that can predict mortality  with an area under 
receiver  operator  characteristic  curve (AUC) of almost 80% up to 60 
days in advance.  One of the relevant  predictors  in our model was a 
prior diagnosis  of dementia,  which increases  the mortality  risk by about 
15%. Based on this ﬁnding,  we explored  the overlap  between  COVID-  
19, Alzheimer’s  (AD), and Parkinson’s  Disease  (PD) molecular  disease  
mechanisms,  which pointed  us to tyrosine  kinase 2 (TYK2)  as a potential  
new drug target. Finally,  our experimental  data with Caco2 and VERO- 
E6 cells suggests  that Sorafenib  and Regorafenib,  two approved  anti- 
cancer drugs, could be repositioned  for treating  severe COVID-19  cases. 
2. Results  
2.1. Overview  about LEOSS data 
The Lean European  Open Survey on SARS-CoV  ‑2 infected  patients  
(LEOSS  - https://leoss.net/  ) is an observational,  multi-center  study fo- 
cusing on PCR or rapid test conﬁrmed  patients.  Study centers are pri- 
marily University  Medical  Centers,  but also include  other hospitals,  in- 
stitutes,  and medical  practices.  Active sites cover several European  coun- 
tries but have a primary  focus on Germany.  They are thought  to generate  
representative  data of (primarily  hospitalized)  COVID-19  cases, at least 
for Germany.  In order to ensure anonymity  in all steps of the analy- 
sis process,  an individual  LEOSS Scientiﬁc  Use File (SUF) was created,  
which is based on the LEOSS Public Use File (PUF) principles  described  
in [29] . The baseline  data from more than 100 active sites, collected  at 
time of a positive  test or diagnosis,  comprises  patient demographics,  dis- 
ease symptoms,  vital parameters,  biomarkers  from urine and blood, and 
comorbidities.  Follow-up  information,  including  survival,  was available  
for patients  between  18 and 85 years. These data were further ﬁltered  
to only include  patients  with less than 50% of missing  data at baseline,  
resulting  into n = 5679 patients  ( Table 1 ). Out of those 5679 patients,  
5225 (92%) were inpatient,  and 569 (10.0%)  were reported  death cases 
within a follow-up  period of up to 78 days. Among  them, 430 (76% of 
569) patients  were reported  death cases within the ﬁrst 20 days ( Fig. 1 ). 
2.2. Machine  learning  can predict mortality  with high accuracy  
We implemented  and compared  a broad panel of time-to-event  ma- 
chine learning  models to predict patient survival  using only LEOSS base- 
line data: 
• Elastic net penalized  Cox proportional  hazards  regression  [ 10 , 66 , 71 ] 
• Elastic net penalized  Weibull  accelerated  failure time regression

ing algorithm  using a loss function  derived  from a Weibull  regression

Notably,  all these models account  for the right censoring  of the data, 
see details in section “Methods  ”. We evaluated  models via a ﬁve-fold  
cross-validation  (CV). In other words, we split the entire dataset into ﬁve

outer folds, and we subsequently  left out one of these folds for testing the 
model, while the rest of the data was used for model training  and tuning.  
Notably,  splitting  of the data was performed  in a stratiﬁed  manner,  such 
that the number  of events was equally  maintained  across all folds. We 
tuned the hyper-parameters  within the CV loop using an extra level of 
inner ﬁve-fold  CV (see Section  4.2 for details).  We employed  Uno’s C- 
index as a metric to assess prediction  performance  [56] . A C-index  of 
50% indicates  chance level, whereas  a C-index  of 100% would reﬂect a 
perfect concordance  of model predictions  and observed  death cases in 
the test data (see Section  4.3 for details).  
Overall,  elastic net penalized  Weibull  regression  achieved  the best 
discrimination  performance  with ∼77% C-index  ( Fig. 2 a) and low cali- 
bration  error (Integrated  Brier Score –IBS) of 0.12 ( Fig. 2 b, Supplemen-  
tary Table 1 ). Furthermore,  a stable prediction  performance  of ∼80% 
AUC was found up to ∼60 days after disease  diagnosis  ( Fig. 2 c). There- 
fore, elastic net penalized  Weibull  regression  was used to subsequently  
train a ﬁnal model on the entire dataset while using the previously  de- 
scribed  approach  for hyper-parameter  tuning.  
2.3. Diagnosis  of dementia  as a relevant  predictor  
The ﬁnal model was further explored  with respect to the impact of 
most relevant  predictors  using Shapley  Additive  Explanations  - SHAP 
[38] . Brieﬂy,  SHAP is an approach  from cooperative  game-theory  to de- 
compose  the overall prediction  of the model into a sum of individual  
feature contributions  (see details in 4.4). In total, the ﬁnal model com- 
prised 160 features.  A complete  list can be found in Supplementary  
File 1 . Fig. 3 a shows the most inﬂuential  features  according  to SHAP, while 
Fig. 3 b summarizes  the inﬂuence  of entire feature modalities,  indicating  
that lab measures  were the most relevant  type of features  (23.5%  cumu- 
lative importance).  Disease  symptoms  ranked second (20.5%)  and co- 
morbidities  third (13.2%  cumulative  importance).  Age, gender,  platelet  
count as well as elevated  troponin  and ferritin concentrations  were 
among the top predictors  in the model, which are all known risk fac- 
tors [ 20 , 42 , 46 , 65 ]. The prognostic  signiﬁcance  of hemoglobin  level and 
autoimmune  hemolytic  anemia  for an unfavorable  disease  outcome  has 
been discussed  in [2] . The C-reactive  protein  (CRP) is a well-known  in- 
fection and inﬂammation  marker,  which has been used as an indicator  
and prognostic  marker  of severity  of COVID-19  infection  [54] . Muscle 
pain is an often observed  symptom  of the infection  [63] , and its extent 
has been associated  to the likelihood  of a more unfavorable  prognosis  of 
hospitalized  COVID-19  patients  [12] . Comorbidity  associated  predictors  
included  hypertension,  an acute kidney injury, diabetes  and dementia  
( Supplementary  Table 2, Supplementary  File 2 ). Again, this is con- 
cordant  with the current  literature  [ 8 , 16 , 43 ]. 
Fig. 4 displays  partial dependency  plots for the previously  discussed  
predictors,  describing  the quantitative  relationship  between  individual  
feature attributes  and their impact on estimated  hazard ratios. Accord-  
ingly, an asymptomatic  Covid-19  infection  ( Fig. 4 b) resulted  into an 
∼35% lower mortality  risk compared  to more severe disease  symptoms,  
and for patients  with low hemoglobin  level ( Fig. 4 c) or low oxygen  satu- 
ration ( Fig. 4 d) mortality  risk was even increased  by 50%. Prior diagno-  
sis of dementia  ( Fig. 4 d) results into an ∼15% increased  mortality  risk 
after SARS-CoV-2-19  infection  (hazard  ratio dementia  vs. non-dementia:  
∼1.15; 95% CI: [1.08, 1.24]). Notably,  there are diﬀerent  possible  ex-

planations  for this ﬁnding:  (a) dementia  might be a proxy for age; (b) 
dementia  might, independently  of age, trigger biological,  physiological  
and psychological  mechanisms  that contribute  to an unfavorable  disease  
outcome.  
2.4. Commonly  aﬀected  molecular  mechanisms  between  neurodegenerative  
disorders  and COVID-19  
We aimed for a more in-depth  exploration  of potential  overlaps  of 
neurodegeneration  and COVID-19  disease  mechanisms.  Notably,  there 
has been increasing  evidence  that SARS-CoV-2  can enter the central ner- 
vous system [ 7 , 36 , 41 ], raising the question  of potential  interactions  with 
dementia  disease  pathologies.  In this context,  [70] recently  reported  an 
overlap  of transcriptionally  dysregulated  biological  pathways  in a very 
limited number  of patients  with Alzheimer’s  Disease  (AD) and COVID-  
19. 
Here, we focused  more broadly  on shared molecular  mechanisms  
linking COVID-19  with AD as well as Parkinson’s  Disease  (PD), another  
major neurodegenerative  disorder,  which has previously  been associ- 
ated with an increased  risk for an unfavorable  outcome  of a SARS-CoV-  2 infection  [ 50 , 59 ]. By looking  at the intersection  between  AD and PD 
cause-and-eﬀect  models (referred  as knowledge  graphs - KGs) and the 
corresponding  COVID-19  KG, in this work we found a series of mech- 
anisms that were shared between  all three disease  etiologies  (Supple-  
mentary  Table 3) . 
Firstly, one of the mechanisms  identiﬁed  by our approach  is related 
to three proteins  involved  in the innate immune  system (i.e., DDX58,  
MAVS, and IFIH1),  and more speciﬁcally  in the detection  and response  
to viruses.  These proteins  are involved  in both indications.  For example,  
MAVS interacts  with the RNA helicase  RIG-I/MDA-5  after the dsRNA of 
the virus is recognized,  leading  to the initiation  of the antiviral  signaling  
cascade  [69] . Related  with this process  is the second shared mechanism,  
which corresponds  to the activation  of the inﬂammasome  and the subse- 
quent triggering  of caspase  activation  through  cytokine  secretion.  This 
mechanism  has been strongly  linked with both AD [21] and PD [61] as 
well as COVID-19  [44] . In the context  of neurodegeneration,  the ac- 
tivation  of the inﬂammasome  leads to the secretion  of inﬂammatory  
cytokines  and cell death through  pyroptosis,  to which both AD and PD 
are associated  via tangle and plaque formation  and death of dopamine  
neurons,  respectively  [4] . Similarly,  in the context  of COVID-19,  the in- 
4 T. Linden, F. Hanses, D. Domingo-Fernández et al. Artiﬁcial Intelligence in the Life Sciences 1 (2021) 100020 
ﬂammasome  is activated  by the proteins  of the SARS-CoV-2  virus, which 
in turn leads to the production  of inﬂammatory  molecules,  and in some 
cases leads to hyperinﬂammation  [44] . Finally,  TYK2 is also present  in 
all three KGs. It is known to be implicated  in the regulation  of apoptosis  
in the amyloid  cascade  of AD [60] as well 𝛼-synuclein-induced  neuroin-  
ﬂammation  and dopaminergic  neurodegeneration  [47] . 
Lastly, IL-6 and IL-10 are among two of the interleukins  secreted  
after inﬂammasome  activation,  one of the shared mechanisms  between  
these pathologies,  and their increased  expression  has been shown to 
be predictive  of COVID-19  severity  [14] . Furthermore,  the interaction  
between  two other proteins  (i.e., DDIT3 and BCL2L11)  involved  in the 
regulation  of apoptosis  is also suggested  as a common  mechanism  across 
these indications  [ 18 , 26 ]. 
2.5. Sorafenib  and regorafenib  as potential  treatments  against COVID-19  
In the following,  we speciﬁcally  focused  on TYK2, which is a 
protein  involved  into the amyloid  cascade.  TYK2 inhibition  results 
into eﬀective  regulation  of IFN 𝛼, IL-10, IL-12, and IL-23 [23] , which 
has speciﬁcally  been reported  in neurodegenerative  disorders  [45] . 
TYK2 has been patented  as drug target in AD (CN102112879B,  
China, [27] ). In addition,  genetic  variants  in TYK2 have recently  been 
associated  to COVID-19  disease  severity  [9] . Moreover,  we found 
several kinase inhibitors  active against  SARS-CoV-2  in a cellular  
screen for anti-cytopathic  eﬀect (anti-CPE)  in two diﬀerent  cellular  
environments:  Caco2 [17] and VERO-E6  [67] . The relative  results of 
those screening  have been made public on ChEMBL  ( https://www.  
ebi.ac.uk/chembl/document_report_card/CHEMBL4303101/  , https://  
www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/document_report_card/CHEMBL4495565/  ), 
respectively.  
We challenged  VERO-E6  cells with SARS-CoV-2  pretreated  with com- 
pounds  from the Fraunhofer  Repurposing  Library  (5632 compounds  - 
https://www.itmp.fraunhofer.de/en/innovation-areas/drug_screening_  repurposing.html  ), the EUOS Bioactives  library ( ∼2500 compounds  
- https://ecbd.eu/compound/#lib{value  = ’2 ′ }lib{value  = ’2 ′ }), and a 
proprietary  “Safe in Man ” library  of compounds  having passed phase 
I clinical  trial ( ∼600 compounds).  Regarding  the phenotypic  assay 
with Caco2 cells to determine  compound  antiviral  activity,  we adapted  
a previously  published  protocol  [37] . Compounds  were added to 
conﬂuent  layers of Caco–2  cells in MEM supplemented  with 1% FBS in 
96-well  plates. For the primary  screen ﬁnal compound  concentration  
was 10 μM (0.1% DMSO ﬁnal) in singlicates.  Dose response  proﬁling  
of selected  priority  compounds  was performed  with a range of eight 
diﬀerent  concentrations  in three independent  replicates  (maximum  
20 μM, minimum  20 nM, half log dilution  factor, 0.1% DMSO ﬁnal). 
Following  the addition  of compounds,  cells were immediately  infected  
with SARS-CoV-2  at MOI 0.01. Control  wells ( + virus and - virus) also 
contained  DMSO at 0.1% DMSO ﬁnal. After 48 h, cells were ﬁxed using 
3% PFA in PBS, and the plates sealed and disinfected  to inactivate  
SARS-CoV-2.  Quantiﬁcation  of viral inhibition  (based upon Caco-2 
cell viability  relative  to controls)  was performed  using high content  
imaging  (PerkinElmer,  Operetta  CLS). For what concerns  the assay on 
VERO-E6  cells, we used basically  the same protocol,  but the time we 
waited for readout  was longer than 48 h (96 h) due to the diﬀerent  
infection  kinetic on these cells. 
In VERO-E6  cells, only Regorafenib  showed  a clear antiviral  CPE po- 
tency with an IC50 of around 3 –5 μM. In Caco2 cells, Sorafenib  and Re- 
gorafenib  demonstrated  a similar antiviral  CPE potency  with an IC50 of 
around 1μM for both molecules  ( Fig. 5 ). Both compounds  are reported  
to be non-selective  JAK/TYK2  inhibitors  [25] . While the involvement  
of the JAK kinase family in inﬂammatory  cytokine  modulation  is well- 
known,  the extent of which TYK2 (a JAK family member)  could be re- 
sponsible  of the observed  CPE eﬀect remains  to be determined  with more 
selective  drug candidates.  Such TYK2 selective  preclinical  compounds  
are currently  not part of our screened  libraries,  because  we focused  on 
repurposing  marketed  kinase inhibitors.  
Fig. 5. Regorafenib  (panels A and C) and Sorafenib  (panels B and D) activities  measured  in diﬀerent  cell lines (Vero-E6  cells upper panels; Caco2 cells lower panels) 
as percentage  inhibition  of viral cytopathic  eﬀect normalized  to Remdesivir  as positive control (100%).  Cells in wells were treated with SARS CoV-2 virus, and drugs 
were administered  after 48 or 96 h after infection.  Subsequently,  cells were stained, washed and counted  if alive. Some signs of toxicity on Caco2 cells (lower panels) 
started to surface at higher drug concentrations  and this might be the reason for the higher observed  variance  of triplicates.  The slightly negative  relative inhibition  
shown in panel D is caused by plate control diﬀerences  within plates.

3. Conclusion  
As of October  2021, the rates of completely  vaccinated  individuals  
in many Western  countries  are stagnating  between  60 –70%, while the 
fraction  of vaccinated  individuals  is globally  only around 36% [40] . Cor- 
respondingly,  case numbers  in many countries  around the world are still 
increasing.  Hence, there is an unmet need for eﬀective  and cost-eﬃcient  
medications  against  severe cases. 
In this work, we ﬁrst developed  a highly predictive  ML model for 
predicting  COVID-19  mortality  on an individual  patient basis using deep 
observational  data from LEOSS,  primarily  covering  the inpatient  situa- 
tion in Germany  (95% of patients).  To our knowledge,  this is the ﬁrst ML 
based mortality  model based on such (notionally)  representative  Ger- 
man data. Notably,  ML models predicting  alternative  endpoints  using 
LEOSS have been published  recently  [ 30 , 64 ]. 
Our ML model demonstrates  similar prediction  performance  to the 
well-known  4C mortality  score, which has been developed  based on rep- 
resentative  data from the UK [3] . However,  a direct comparison  between  
both models is not possible,  because  the 4C model is formulated  as a 
classiﬁer  predicting  all-cause  in-hospital  mortality,  whereas  our model 
is formulated  as a time-to-event  model predicting  all-cause  time depen- 
dent mortality  risk after COVID-19  diagnosis.  Our model, thus, considers  
censoring  of survival  times after patients  have left hospital  or other med- 
ical facilities.  Our mortality  model was built on a set of patients,  which 
is thought  to be primarily  representative  for German  hospitals.  Whether  
there are unknown  selection  biases, remains  an open question  and they 
were not under our control.  Moreover,  it is unclear  whether  our model 
would be predictive  for patients  in other countries.  
We showed  that dementia,  as one of the relevant  predictors  in our 
model, intersects  on a molecular  mechanism  level with COVID-19.  To- 
gether with evidence  from recent GWAS studies,  this pointed  us to TYK2 
as a potential  drug target for COVID-19.  Using a cellular  screening  as- 
say for anti-cytopathic  eﬀect, we identiﬁed  the anti-cancer  drugs Re- 
gorafenib  and Sorafenib  as potential  drug candidates  against  COVID-  
19. Notably,  the known association  of JAK family inhibitors  like Rego- 
rafenib and Sorafenib  with cellular  inﬂammatory  cytokines  can be fur- 
ther characterized  by investigating  transcription  dynamics  within the 
ﬁrst 12 h after SARS-CoV-2  viral infection  compared  to mock control 
[55] . Based on such data, Stukalov  et al. [55], tested both compounds  in 
the A549-ACE2  cell line and reported  increased  virus growth  after treat- 
ment. Other authors  recently  reported  Sorafenib  to be a potent STING 
inhibitor  eﬀectively  stopping  virus growth  in THP1 cells and thus sug- 
gested to pay more attention  to COVID-19  treatment  strategies  that ad- 
dress the dysregulation  of cytokines  [13] . Since the used cell lines in 
both cases were diﬀerent  from ours, results are not directly  comparable.  
Hence, we see a need for further tests with Regorafenib  and Sorafenib  
in other cell systems.  
In addition  to further experimental  validation  of Regorafenib  and 
Sorafenib,  it could be interesting  to explore  in large scale clinical  real- 
world data whether  SARS-CoV-2  infected  patients  treated with Rego- 
rafenib or Sorafenib  demonstrate  a lower mortality  than other SARS- 
CoV-2 patients.  
Overall,  our work demonstrates  that interpretation  of an ML based 
risk model trained  on rich data can point towards  drug targets and new 
treatment  options,  which are strongly  needed  for COVID-19.  
4. Methods  
4.1. Kaplan-Meier  estimator  
The Kaplan-Meier  product  limit estimator  is classical  non-parametric  
statistic  to estimate  a survival  function  𝑆( 𝑡 ) [32] : Let 𝑡 𝑖 denote a time 
point, where at least one event / death happened.  The number  of events 
(deaths)  at 𝑡 𝑖 is denoted  as 𝑑 𝑖 , and the number  of individuals  known to 
have survived  up to 𝑡 𝑖 is 𝑛 𝑖 . Then the Kaplan-Meier  estimator  ̂𝑆 ( 𝑡 ) of the 
survival  function  (representing  the probability  that life is longer than 𝑡 ) is given by: 
̂𝑆 ( 𝑡 ) = ∏
𝑖 ∶ 𝑡 𝑖 ≤ 𝑡 ( 
1 − 𝑑 𝑖 
𝑛 𝑖 ) 
and ̂𝑆 (0) = 1 . ̂𝑆 ( 𝑡 ) is a right-continuous  step function  with jumps at event 
times 𝑡 𝑖 . Censoring  at certain time points aﬀect the estimate  only by 
reducing  the number  of individuals  that are at risk for a subsequent  
event. 
4.2. Machine  learning  models for predicting  COVID-19  mortality  
We compared  ﬁve diﬀerent  machine  learning  algorithms,  as outlined  
in Section  2.2 . Here, we only elaborate  on the best performing  one, 
namely  the elastic net penalized  Weibull  regression:  The elastic net is a 
regularization  and variable  selection  method,  to shrink coeﬃcients  us- 
ing a linear combination  of 𝐿 1 and 𝐿 2 penalties.  The Weibull  regression  
is an accelerated  failure time (AFT) model, which means that covari- 
ates act multiplicatively  on (survival)  time. It is used if the proportional  
hazards  assumption  of the Cox model is not satisﬁed.  AFT models allow 
to directly  estimate  (the eﬀect of covariates  on) expected  failure times, 
where the time until failure is the duration  of survival.  
Let 𝑖 ∈{ 1 , …, 𝑛 } denote the 𝑖 -th patient with covariate  vector 𝑥 𝑖 ∈ ℝ
 𝑝 and observed  follow-up  time 𝑇 𝑖 . Furthermore,  let 𝛿𝑖 ∈{ 0 , 1 } be an 
event indicator  (0 = right censored,  1 = uncensored)  at 𝑇 𝑖 . The true 
and potentially  unobserved  survival  time is 𝑍 𝑖 , and the censoring  time 
is 𝐶 𝑖 . That means 𝑇 𝑖 = min ( 𝑍 𝑖 , 𝐶 𝑖 ) and 𝛿𝑖 = 1{ 𝑇 𝑖 = 𝑍 𝑖 } . The censoring  is 
supposed  to be non-informative  about the true survival  time [49] . In 
a Weibull  AFT model, we assume  𝑍 𝑖 |𝑥 𝑖 ∼𝑊 𝑒𝑖𝑏𝑢𝑙 𝑙 ( 𝛾, 𝜁) , i.e. the hazard 
function  has the form 
ℎ ( 𝑍 𝑖 |𝑥 𝑖 ) = exp (𝛽𝑇 𝑥 𝑖 )𝜁𝛾𝑍
 𝛾−1 
𝑖 
Parameters  of a standard  Weibull  AFT model can be estimated  by 
maximizing  the likelihood  [68] : 
𝐿 ( 𝛽, 𝛾, 𝜁) = 𝑛 ∏
𝑖 =1 ℎ ( 𝑇 𝑖 |𝑥 𝑖 ) 𝛿𝑖 𝑆( 𝑇 𝑖 |𝑥 𝑖 ) 
where 𝑆( ⋅) denotes  the survival  function  𝑆( 𝑇 𝑖 |𝑥 𝑖 ) = exp { − 𝑇 𝑖 
∫
0 ℎ ( 𝑠 |𝑥 𝑖 ) 𝑑𝑠 } . 
To account  for overﬁtting,  our case coeﬃcients  𝛽were additionally  
penalized  via the elastic net penalty:  
Ω( 𝛽) = 𝛼𝜆||𝛽||1 + ( 1 − 𝛼) 𝜆||𝛽||2 
Hyperparameters  (i.e. 𝛼, 𝜆) were tuned with Bayesian  hyperparame-  
ter optimization  using the Optuna  package  [1] within the inner-loop  of 
the nested cross-validation.  Early stopping  was used if applicable  (Deep- 
Surv, GBM, XGBSE),  and the best candidate  model was subsequently  
selected.  We chose the 5-fold cross-validated  Harrell’s  C-index  [22] as 
objective  for the hyperparameter  tuning.  We ran the optimization  for 
twenty initial epochs,  adopted  the search space if reasonable,  and then 
ran it for another  twenty rounds.  Thus, forty hyperparameter  sets were 
evaluated  and the resulting  best combination  was selected  based on the 
highest  objective  function  value. Using this hyperparameter  set, we sub- 
sequently  trained  a model on the entire training  data and evaluated  it 
on the held-out  test set. 
4.3. Uno’s concordance-index  
The prediction  performance  of time-to-event  models can be eval- 
uated with respect to discriminating  between  subjects  with diﬀerent  
event times via Uno’s C-index  [56] : The C-index  (Concordance  index) is 
a generalization  of the area under receiver  operator  characteristic  curve 
(AUC) for time-to-event  models [ 24 , 51 ]. A value of 100% means perfect 
discriminative  performance,  and 50% is comparable  to random  predic- 
tions. 
In essence,  Uno’s C is a rank correlation  between  the risk predictions  
and the observed  event times. The C-index  measures  the concordance  
6 T. Linden, F. Hanses, D. Domingo-Fernández et al. Artiﬁcial Intelligence in the Life Sciences 1 (2021) 100020 
across all pairs of patients  ( 𝑖, 𝑗 ) , 𝑖 ≠𝑗. A pair is classiﬁed  concordant  
if the predicted  risk is higher for the patient with lower survival  time. 
Uno’s C-index  was developed  as an alternative  to Harrell’s  C-index  in set- 
tings with high censoring  rates and leads to consistent  concordance  es- 
timates  under the general  random  censoring  assumption.  Uno’s C-index  
uses an inverse  probability  censoring  weighting  (IPCW)  approach  [56] : 
̂𝐶 𝑈𝑛𝑜 = ∑𝑛 
𝑖 ≠𝑗 δ𝑖 ̂𝐺 (𝑡
 𝑖 )−2 𝐼( 𝑡 𝑖 < 𝑡 𝑗 |𝑡 𝑖 < 𝜏) 𝐼( ̂ℎ 𝑖 > ̂ℎ 𝑗 ) 
∑𝑛 
𝑖 ≠𝑗 δ𝑖 ̂𝐺 (𝑡
 𝑖 )−2 𝐼( 𝑡 𝑖 < 𝑡 𝑗 |𝑡 𝑖 < 𝜏) 
The numerator  counts the concordant  pairs and the denominator  the 
valid pairs, respectively.  For patients  𝑖 ∈{ 1 , …, 𝑛 } , 𝛿𝑖 is 1 if an event 
(death)  was observed  and otherwise  0, ̂𝐺 ( ⋅) is the Kaplan-Meier  estima-  
tor for the censoring  distribution  for IPCW, ̂ℎ 𝑖 is the risk prediction  of the 
𝑖 -th patient,  𝑡 𝑖 is the observed  time and 𝜏is a stability  parameter,  for 
further details see [56] . 
4.4. Feature importance  using SHAP 
Shapley  Additive  Explanations  [38] are a model-agnostic  approach  
from coalitional  game theory. The assumption  of this framework  is, that 
individuals  (feature  attributes)  are cooperating  as a team (patient  fea- 
ture vector) for a joint outcome  (model prediction).  SHAP’s  goal is to 
estimate  those individual  contributions  to the outcome.  Key properties  
are a) the solution  is unique;  b) local exactness,  which means the sum of 
feature contributions  matches  the output;  c) if a feature has no impact,  
then it’s SHAP-value  is zero. 
Mathematically,  additivity  and property  b) can be described  as: 
𝑓 ( 𝑥 ) = 𝑔 (𝑥
 ′)=
 𝜙0 + 𝑀 ∑
𝑖 =1 𝜙𝑖 𝑥 ′𝑖 
𝑥 = ℎ 𝑥 (𝑥
 ′)with
 𝑓( 𝑥 ) being the original  model and 𝑔( 𝑥 ′) the explanation  model de- 
ﬁned on simpliﬁed  inputs 𝑥 ′∈{ 0 , 1 } 𝑀 . Moreover,  ℎ 𝑥 ( ⋅) is a function  
mapping  𝑥 to the simpliﬁed  input 𝑥 ′. 𝜙𝑖 ∈ℝ is the SHAP value of the 
𝑖 -th feature for the model input vector 𝑥 and 𝜙0 denotes  the expectation  
value of 𝑓( 𝑥 ) . In other words: The SHAP values 𝜙𝑖 quantiﬁes  how much 
a particular  feature pushes the prediction  away from the population  av- 
erage 𝜙0 . SHAP values 𝜙𝑖 are computed  as follows:  
𝜙𝑖 ( 𝑓, 𝑥 ) = ∑
𝑆⊆𝐹∖ { 𝑖 } ( |𝐹 ||𝑆
 |) −1 [𝑓
 𝑆∪{ 𝑖 } (𝑥
 𝑆∪{ 𝑖 } )−
 𝑓 𝑆 (𝑥
 𝑆 )]In
 other words, SHAP values are deﬁned  as a weighted  (binomial  
coeﬃcient)  sum of the diﬀerences  between  (in square brackets)  “pre- 
diction including  the feature ”minus  “prediction  excluding  the feature ”, 
for any subset 𝑆in the power set 𝐹 . 𝑓 𝑆∪{ 𝑖 } denotes  the model trained  
with feature 𝑖 included  and 𝑓 𝑆 without  it. Similarly,  𝑥 𝑆∪{ 𝑖 } denotes  the 
feature subset with feature 𝑖 included  and 𝑥 𝑆 without  it. 
4.5. Conﬁdence  intervals  for hazard ratios 
To construct  a conﬁdence  interval  for the hazard ratio of “dementia  
vs. non-dementia  ”w e performed  a bootstrap:  We resampled  100,000  
times with replacement  a pair of a demented  and non-demented  patient.  
We then calculated  the ratio of the SHAP values for the feature “prior 
dementia  diagnosis  ”for both patients.  
4.6. Identiﬁcation  of common  molecular  mechanisms  between  COVID-19  
and neurodegenerative  diseases  
To identify  the shared molecular  mechanisms  between  COVID-19,  
AD, and PD, we leveraged  several resources  listed in Supplementary  
Table 3. These were combined  into two independent  Knowledge  Graphs 
(KGs) following  the harmonization  procedure  described  in our previous  work [52] and [15] . By doing so, we combined  disease  speciﬁc  molec- 
ular interactions  pertaining  to COVID-19  and two neurological  indica- 
tions (i.e., AD and PD) into graph structures:  one for COVID-19  and one 
for AD and PD. Subsequently,  we calculated  the intersection  of these 
graphs.  Supplementary  File 2 contains  the corresponding  shared mech- 
anisms as an Excel table.
