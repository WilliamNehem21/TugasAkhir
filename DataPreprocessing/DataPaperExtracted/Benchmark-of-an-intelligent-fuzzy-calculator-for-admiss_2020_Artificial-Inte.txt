Keywords:Drawbar powerDrawbar pullPower efﬁciencyWheel slipGross traction forceThis paper proposes a calculator for estimation of drawbar pull supplied by mechanical front wheel drive tractorbased on nominal input variable of tractor driving mode in two-wheel drive (2WD) and four-wheel drive (4WD),and numeral input variables of tractor weight (53.04 –78.45 kN) and slip of driving wheels (1.4 –15.1%) utilizing intelligent fuzzy systems. The systems were developed by means of various input membership functions, outputmembership functions, defuzziﬁcation methods, and training cycles. The prominent developed system for esti-mation of the drawbar pull yielded a user-friendly intelligent fuzzy calculator with admissible accuracy (coef ﬁ- cient of determination = 0.993). Data obtained from the calculator revealed increasing nonlinear trend of thedrawbar pull in range of 12.9 –57.5 kN as concurrent augment of slip of the wheels and tractor weight, for2WD mode. In case of the 4WD mode, it nonlinearly raised from 12.8 to 77.7 kN. Therefore, effect of the slipand weight on the drawbar pull was found synergetic. Moreover, the drawbar pull ranges elucidated that thedrawbar pull proliferated as the 4WD mode was employed rather than the 2WD mode. Generally, benchmarkof the prominent developed intelligent fuzzy system, not only provide simple calculator with the widest applica-bility for different tractor models, but also produces added values in enrichment of realization level in domain oftractor drawbar pull concepts.© 2020 The Authors.

1. IntroductionInvestigation on drawbar pull supplied by off road driving wheelshas been interest for researchers from six decades ago. Available pub-lished documents indicate that, for theﬁrst time,Forrest et al. (1962) attempted to ascertain effect of various parameters on the drawbarpull. This attempt was followed afterwards by other agricultural engi-neers in time periods of sixties and seventies of the twentieth century(McLeod et al., 1966;Zombori, 1967;Burt et al., 1974;Burt et al., 1979;Raghavan and McKyes, 1979). These researches have been con-tinued until recent years (Bailey and Burt, 1981;Burt and Bailey, 1982;Burt et al., 1984;Foda, 1991;Taghavifar and Mardani, 2015; Kumar et al., 2019). In the mentioned research works, for speci ﬁc soil conditions, main inﬂuential factors affecting the drawbar pull were re-ported as dynamic weight, slip, and dimensions of the wheel.Parallel to these researches in the sixties, army engineers of theUnited States of America in Waterways Experiment Station startedtheir efforts for studying drawbar pull of off road driving wheels.Outcome of their efforts led to presentation of a new engineering pa-rameter for wheel size and soil characteristics. The parameter hasbeen called wheel mobility number (Freitag, 1966;Freitag, 1968). The parameter was subsequently employed by engineers ( Wismer and Luth, 1973;Wismer and Luth, 1974) in technical center of Deere & Com-pany in order to develop mathematical model for estimation of grosstraction force and the drawbar pull of the wheel. The model proposedby the engineers estimates the gross traction force and drawbar pullbased on dynamic weight, slip, and dimensions of the wheel. This ap-proach of mathematical modeling has been followed by other re-searchers (Gee-Clough, 1980;Wulfsohn et al., 1988;Sharma and Pandey, 1998;Srivastava et al., 2006;Maclaurin, 2014;Mason et al., 2018) based on the main mentioned inﬂuential factors. However, some miscellaneous mathematical models have been yet developedby other researchers (Hayes and Ligon, 1981;Ashmore et al., 1987; Upadhyaya et al., 1989;Evans et al., 1991;Vechinski et al., 1998; Sharma and Pandey, 2001;Rosca et al., 2014). Since some agricultural engineers (Southwell, 1964;Steinbruegge and Larsen, 1966;
Kliefoth, 1966;Southwell, 1967;Domier and Persson, 1968;Domier and Friesen, 1969;Wang et al., 1989)i nt h e sixties and seventies of the twentieth century tended to ascertain draw-bar pull supplied by tractor in various processes, the aforementioned re-searchers who concerned with development of mathematical modelssuggested utilization of the models for estimation of tractor drawbarArtiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 4 (2020) 209 –218

journal homepage:http://www.keaipublishing.com/en/journals/artificial-intelligence-in-agriculture/pull. The utilization can be performed by summation of drawbar pullprovided by each driving wheel. Main drawback of this method is attrib-uted to model conditions which are established for speci ﬁc tire type (bias and radial ply), soil texture (silt, clay, and sandy), slip value, testedsurface and environment (Tiwari et al., 2010;Keen et al., 2013;Sunusi et al., 2020). Another drawback of the method is related to its applica-tion for the MFWD tractors. Front and rear driving wheels of theMFWD tractors have different dimensions, dynamic weight, and tire in-ﬂation pressure. Thus, utilization of the mathematical models for esti-mation of drawbar pull of the MFWD tractors in speci ﬁc conditions results in frequently consequent calculations. These calculations canbe partly decreased by employment of new parameter of tractor mobil-ity number (tractor vehicle number). Concept of the tractor vehiclenumber was initially introduced byGrisso et al. (1992)and completed byTaylor et al. (1995), afterward. However, this scheme was also nota drastic effort for presenting a method for direct estimation of thedrawbar pull. Hence, development of a general model for estimationof drawbar pull supplied by the MFWD tractor based on some majortractor parameters is a highlight topic for researchers, undoubtedly.Notable progress of computer simulation tools for multivariate esti-mations of phenomena leads to worldwide application of the tools inengineering and scientiﬁc works. Literature screening process provedthis fact for attempts conducted by researchers ( Battiato and Diserens, 2013;Battiato and Diserens, 2017) in case of estimation of drawbarpull supplied by the MFWD tractor. In the cited works, the researchersdeveloped a computer program for estimation of the tractor drawbarpull as function of several input parameters (weight of front and rearaxles, soil mechanical characterizations, tire speci ﬁcations, tractor ge- ometry, and slip of driving wheels). The developed program was fedwith constant soil characterizations for the front and rear wheels. How-ever, bulk density and cone index of soil are proliferated after passage offront wheels (Rush, 1969;Holm, 1969;Bashford et al., 1988;Abebe et al., 1989;Srivastava et al., 2006;Lyasko, 2010;Taghavifar and Mardani, 2014a). Thus, the rear wheels encounter with higher coneindex and bulk density of soil. This deﬁciency in assumptions results in decrement of conﬁdence level of the program for accurate estimationof the drawbar pull. From another point of view, although estimation ofthe tractor drawbar pull by the developed program is relatively appro-priate for broad spectrum of conditions, high numbers of prerequisiteinput parameters of the program prevent the widest employment ofthe program by engineers, researchers, and associated managers. There-fore, it is indispensable to take a drastic effort for development ofgeneral computer simulation system working like simple calculatorfor estimation of the drawbar pull based on minimum major input pa-rameters of the MFWD tractor.Among several computer simulation systems, intelligent types aresimulation workspaces typically worked through predetermined se-quential calculations for foundation of correlation between output andinput data. These types are well known simulation systems due totheir capability for intelligent simulation of multiple input and outputparameters with self-training algorithm for nonlinear and uncertainphenomena. These outstanding capabilities result in applying intelli-gent simulation systems inﬁeld of Biosystems Engineering researchesin recent years in case of two well-known types of the simulation sys-tems (neural and fuzzy systems). Details of development and validationof neural simulation systems in these researches can be found in somepublished documents (Taghavifar and Mardani, 2014b;Shafaei et al.,2016a;Taghavifar and Mardani, 2017;Shafaei et al., 2018a;Shafaei et al., 2019a). Furthermore, there are some documents in literature forsuccessful application of fuzzy simulation systems in these researches(Khoshnevisan et al., 2014;Daneshmand et al., 2015;Shafaei et al., 2018b;Elijah et al., 2020). Analysis of the literature for performance ofintelligent neural and fuzzy simulation systems approved that thefuzzy systems can estimate phenomena with higher accuracy than neu-ral systems. This fact has been remarkably publicized by the same au-thors (Shafaei et al., 2015;Shafaei et al., 2018c;Shafaei et al., 2019b; Shafaei et al., 2019c;Shafaei et al., 2019d) in case of compound effect of nominal and numeral input parameter on output target.According to dearth of information in the published works for offer-ing general computer simulation system for estimation of drawbar pullsupplied by the MFWD tractor and reliability of fuzzy simulation sys-tems for multivariate estimation of nominal and numeral input vari-ables, proved in the literature, this study was intended to developfuzzy simulation systems for estimation of the drawbar pull on thebasis of combined major nominal input variable of tractor drivingmode (2WD and 4WD) and numeral input variables of tractor weight,and slip of driving wheels. In this regard, it was expected to provideprominent simulation system with user-friendly environment whichworks like a simple calculator.2. Research methodology2.1. Speciﬁcations of tractorsEleven MFWD models of New Holland tractors were considered inthis study. The New Holland type was selected because it is a populartractor that is frequently sold and supported in Iran. The models in con-junction with some engineering speciﬁcations are tabulated inTable 1.2.2. Drawbar pull testsThe NTTL has spearhead for testing tractors and reported source ofreliable data. These data have been arranged for fuel consumption,wheel slip, engine speed, forward speed, drawbar pull, drawbarpower, and hydraulic oil temperature of tested tractor. The hydraulicoil temperature was measured and monitored to verify steady state op-erating conditions of the tractor and data collection procedure ( Roeber et al., 2017).From 1986, the NTTL has tested performance of tractors based on of-ﬁcial procedure described by the OECD standard ( Kocher et al., 2011). Currently, the OECD standard Code 2 was devoted for of ﬁcial testing of performance of agricultural and forestry tractors under steady statecontrolled conditions (OECD, 2020). According to the standard, thetests must be conducted on concreteﬂat surface in order to eliminate ef-fect of soil characteristics on tractor performance. During the tests, thetractor was loaded by a load car. The load car controlled the loads ap-plied to the tractor. The load car was a Caterpillar articulated dumptruck. The load car was outﬁtted with two load cell transducersNomenclatureAFS actual forward speed (km/h)CNU coefﬁcient of non-uniformity (%)CV coefﬁcient of variation (%)DP

210(1232ALD-100-K-B, Scottsdale, Ariz) connected together in series formand attached to tested tractor hitch to measure drawbar pull suppliedby the tractor. The drawbar pull was initially measured in the ﬁrst load cell transducer, while the second one was employed to con ﬁrm measured load by theﬁrst one (Roeber et al., 2017). Moreover, the load car was equipped with two controllers for data acquisition withcollection rate of 1 kHz and load control. The exterior-mounted control-ler was a NI CRIO 9073 and the controller inside the cab was a NIPIX1042Q. Software interface was LabVIEW version 12.0F3 ( Kocher et al., 2017). Actual forward speed was also measured using a non-drivingﬁfth wheel traveled under the load car. Meanwhile, forwardspeed of rear wheels of the tested tractor was measured as theoreticalforward speed (Howard et al., 2013). Therefore, slip values of the testedtractor wheels were ascertained and logged in the data acquisitionbased on Eq.(1)(Muro and O'Brien, 2004;Andreev et al., 2010; Maclaurin, 2018).S

If similar results were achievedfor two tests, next load set point was applied. If the results were not sim-ilar, more data were collected until two tests showed similar results. De-tails for test track with concreteﬂat surface were fully explained byHoward et al. (2013). The test data sets (288 sets) considered in thisstudy for all eleven MFWD models of New Holland tractor were col-lected at the NTTL from 2000 to 2004.2.3.

Development of intelligent fuzzy systemsIntelligent fuzzy systems were developed to estimate drawbar pullsupplied by the MFWD tractor, based on three independent input vari-ables of slip of driving wheels, tractor weight, and tractor driving mode.The intelligent fuzzy system hasﬁve layers comprising various nodesin each layer. Theseﬁve layers are called fuzziﬁcation, normalization, fuzzy rule, defuzziﬁcation, and output layer, respectively. The intelli-gent fuzzy estimation is accomplished through passing data sets intheseﬁve layers. The estimation scenario is explained in followingparagraph.When input data sets are imported into the system in the ﬁrst layer nodes, they are graded between zero and one by input membershipfunctions (trapezium, triangular, sigmoid, constant, generalized bell(Gbell) and Gaussian). The graded data are transferred to the secondlayer nodes as input data. The numerical weights are assigned to thedata in the second layer. Additionally, the second layer normalizes theweighted input data. The weighted input data are shifted to the thirdlayer nodes as input data of fuzzy rules. These rules are de ﬁned based on the IF and THEN structure through self-training algorithm. These def-initions are intelligently tuned regarding relationships between inputand output data. Output data obtained by the rules are collected and ag-gregated to one output value in the fourth layer nodes. This value is con-verted to anticipate output target by defuzzi ﬁcation method (weighted sum and weighted average). Output membership functions (constantand linear) are used for this task. The desired output target is ultimatelyachieved in theﬁfth layer node.I nt h ef u z z yw o r k s p a c eo fM a t l a bR 2016b software, data sets obtainedfrom the ofﬁcial NTTL reports were randomly shufﬂed and classiﬁed into three clusters. The clusters including 70% (202 data sets), 15% (43 datasets) and 15% (43 data sets) for training, validating and testing, respec-tively, of each developed system. To estimate the drawbar pull(12.9–57.5 kN) based on input variables of tractor weight (53.04 –78.45 kN), slip of driving wheels (1.4 –15.1%), and tractor driving mode(2WD and 4WD), the ranges of the tractor weight and slip of drivingwheels were directly deﬁned in the workspace and integers 2 and 4were assigned for the 2WD and 4WD, respectively. Development processwas frequently accomplished until the best structure of the system withthe highest estimation accuracy was reached. The process was ﬁnalized utilizing different types of input membership functions (trapezium, tri-angular, sigmoid, constant, generalized bell (Gbell) and Gaussian), thenumbers of input membership functions, types of output membershipfunctions (constant and linear), training cycles, and defuzzi ﬁcation methods (weighted sum and weighted average). To avoid prolongationof the paper, equation descriptions of input membership functions, out-put membership functions, and defuzziﬁcation methods are referred to Jang (1993).O p e r a t i o n a lﬂowchart for selection of the prominent systemis depicted inFig. 1.2.5. Performance appraisal of developed intelligent fuzzy systemsTo apprise performance of developed intelligent fuzzy systems forestimation of drawbar pull supplied by the MFWD tractor, suitabilitycriteria of regression coefﬁcient of determination was calculated basedon Eq.(6)(Shafaei et al., 2016b). Moreover, absolute and relative errorsof estimation were ascertained by Eqs.(7) and (8), respectively (Shafaei et al., 2017a). Mean of absolute values of estimation errors was also cal-culated by Eq.(9). The highest values of coefﬁcient of determination and the lowest values of absolute and relative errors of estimation indicatedthe best system for estimation of the drawbar pull.R

212published by previous researchers (Taylor et al., 1967;Shinone et al., 2010).In theTable 2, the standard deviation values with low ﬂuctuation range (7.09–18.15 kN) for measured drawbar pull conﬁrmed high accu- racy of the NTTL instrumentation system. Moreover, taking note fromtheTable 2demonstrates relatively high values were obtained for coef-ﬁcient of variation and coefﬁcient of non-uniformity of the drawbarpull. These high values indicated noteworthy changes of the drawbarpull as affected by slip of driving wheels and tractor weight.3.2.

213deviation modulus (2.893%). Structure of the developed system number15 in accordance with other 19 developed systems are tabulated inTable 3. The Table 3 implies that structure of the developed systemnumber 15 comprised 174 training cycles, 3 input membership func-tions for slip of driving wheels and tractor weight, and 2 input member-ship functions for tractor driving mode, Gaussian and linear function forinput and output, respectively, and weighted average defuzzi ﬁcation method.Graphical demonstration of superior value of coef ﬁcient of determi- nation as depicted inFig. 5shows that the estimated and actual values ofthe drawbar pull were appropriately clustered close to 1:1 line whichindicate excellent correlation between the estimated and actual values.Additionally, scattered distribution of estimation error in Fig. 6obvi- ously shows that no speciﬁc pattern was recognizable in the errors forthe prominent system and distribution of the error values was ran-domly scattered. Mean of absolute values of estimation errors wasfound to be 1.043 kN.Fig. 7exhibits frequency of estimation errorwhich is shown low ranges of percentage of the errors. Therefore, itcan be concluded that estimation error of the prominent system wasnot sensitive to actual data and consequently, it is inferred that thesystem was appropriately matched to actual data. Similar to this result,the previous authors (Sefeedpari et al., 2016;Shafaei et al., 2017b; Shafaei et al., 2018d;Kaveh et al., 2018) in their Biosystems Engineeringresearches have positively reported adequacy of intelligent fuzzy sys-tem for estimation of desired variables.According to the observed results, it is found that the drawbar pullwas acceptably estimated by the prominent system developed in thisresearch. The prominent system yielded a user-friendly intelligentfuzzy calculator. User interface of the calculator is illustrated in Fig. 8. The calculator can be simply employed based on importing values oftractor driving mode, tractor weight, and slip of driving wheels in allow-able range in predetermined place (bottom red bold framework in theFig. 8). Consequently, tractor drawbar pull can be also observed inpredetermined place (top red bold framework in the Fig. 8).3.3. Ascertainment of drawbar pull trendTo ascertain trend of drawbar pull supplied by the MFWD tractors,three-dimensional surface plots have been drawn in Fig. 9based on out- put data from the calculator.

214changed as slip of driving wheels and tractor weight varied. Physicalperception obtained from theFig. 9indicates that the drawbar pullnonlinearly proliferated as slip of driving wheels and tractor weight in-creased in ranges of 1.4–15.1% and 53.04–78.45 kN, respectively, for both tractor driving modes of the 2WD and 4WD. These results havebeen obtained for the drawbar pull of the tractors tested in the NTTLon concreteﬂat surface. For the drawbar pull augmentation of tractorsworking on soil surface, some interpretations have been addressed byprevious authors as mentioned in following paragraph.When tractor weight augments, weight of its wheels increases, de-terministically. As weight of driving wheels ascends, greater soil volumebetween tire lugs is trapped which is led to increase resistive shearforces of soil volume. This task reinforces interaction of soil and tire,and consequently results in proliferation of net traction force(Taghavifar and Mardani, 2015;Taghavifar et al., 2015). When net trac- tion force developed by the driving wheels augments, obtained drawbarpull of the tractor increases. Meanwhile, the drawbar pull augmentationwith wheel slip increment could be attributed to rise of resistive tangen-tial forces of deformable soil layers compacted by the wheel, as the slipincreases and thereby results in increment of net traction force(Taghavifar and Mardani, 2014c;Taghavifar and Mardani, 2014d; Taghavifar and Mardani, 2015). When net traction force generated bydriving wheels increases, obtained drawbar pull for the tractor rises.The same results for increase of the tractor drawbar pull as a result of in-crement of slip of driving wheels and tractor weight have been found byRichardson and Cooper (1970)andRasool and Raheman (2018). It must be spotlighted that slip of driving wheels have indirect rela-tion with inﬂation pressure, dynamic load, and tire type (bias and radialply). Tire types of the New Holland tractors in this study were radial ply.Radial ply tires develop higher gross traction force than bias ply ones(VandenBerg and Reed, 1962;Forrest et al., 1962;Taylor et al., 1976; Gee-Clough et al., 1977;Wulfsohn et al., 1988;Kumar et al., 2019). Moreover, the radial ply tires have lower slip ( Cegnar and Fausti, 1961;Worthington, 1962;Coates, 1985) and rolling resistance force (Thaden, 1962;McAllister, 1983;Kurjenluoma et al., 2009;Kumar et al., 2019) in comparison with the bias ply tires in the same conditionsof tire and soil. These facts are corresponded to footprint of radial plytire on soil than that of the bias ply tires ( Thaden, 1962;Kumar et al.,

2152018). The higher footprint with narrower and longer shape ( Cegnar and Fausti, 1961;VandenBerg and Reed, 1962;Taylor et al., 1976)d i s - tributes uniform ground contact pressure and decreases rolling resis-tance force, andﬁnally leads to lower slip and higher gross tractionforce (Cegnar and Fausti, 1961). Therefore, in the same conditions ofsoil and wheels, employment of radial ply tire rather than bias ply tiretype could be an effective way for increment of net traction force gener-ated by driving wheel as well as the tractor drawbar pull.To more clearly inspect trend of variations of the drawbar pull as af-fected by the variables, dual effect of slip of driving wheels and tractorweight on the drawbar pull should be considered. To do this, projectedarea of the three-dimensional surfaces on horizontal plane are mani-fested inFig. 10. The projected areas in theFig. 10clarify that the dual effect of slip of driving wheels and tractor weight on the drawbar pullwas increasingly synergistic. It is plausible in the 2WD projected areathat the drawbar pull proliferated from the lowest bound (<10kN) tothe highest bound (>50 kN) as congruent increment of slip of drivingwheels and tractor weight from 0 to 16% and 50 to 80 kN, respectively.In case of the 4WD, it proliferated from the lowest bound (<10 kN)to the highest bound (>80 kN). According to these bounds, it wasfound that the drawbar pull of the 4WD was changed in higher bound(average bound = 45.45 kN) than that of the 2WD (average bound =37.92 kN). This fact could be attributed to employment of four drivingwheels of the 4WD tractor than two driving wheels of the 2WD tractorwhich is resulted in higher total net traction force produced by drivingwheels. Consequently, drawbar pull supplied by the 4WD mode ishigher than that of the 2WD mode. This result is compatible with thatof statistical reports obtained from the Table 2.3.4. Application restrictions of developed calculatorIn this study, the intelligent fuzzy system of developed calculator hasbeen trained based on the drawbar pull data sets of some tractors testedin the NTTL. It must be acknowledged that drawbar pull tests in theNTTL have been commonly performed on concrete ﬂat surface. There- fore, the calculator in this form can be used for construction and indus-trial environments with concreteﬂat surface and it cannot be employedfor various soil conditions and types of the MFWD tractor. This restric-tion implies necessity of adoption of the calculator for different modelsof the MFWD tractors and soil conditions in future research works byretraining the intelligent system of the calculator with more speci ﬁc data sets. Another inherent drawback of the calculator is regarded toworkspace of its user interface. Since the calculator has been developedin fuzzy workspace of the Matlab software, dependency of its user inter-face on the software restricts its broad employment. Therefore, this re-striction dictates necessity of a drastic effort for development ofspreadsheet graphical user interface for the calculator like ones sug-gested by some previous researchers ( Al-Hamed and Al-Janobi, 2001;

Summary and conclusionThis paper deals with benchmark of a simple calculator for admissi-ble estimation of drawbar pull supplied by the MFWD tractors. To dothis, different intelligent fuzzy systems were developed and appraisedbased on nominal input variable of tractor driving mode (2WD and4WD), and numeral input variables of tractor weight (53.04 –78.45 kN) and slip of driving wheels (1.4 –15.1%). The prominent developedsystem yielded a user-friendly intelligent fuzzy calculator with admissi-ble accuracy (coefﬁcient of determination = 0.993, root mean squareerror = 1.289 kN, mean relative deviation modulus = 2.893% andmean of absolute values of estimation errors = 1.043 kN). Hence, itcan be asserted that problematic challenge of estimation of tractordrawbar pull by frequent employments of mathematical models foreach tractor driving wheels was obviated and thereby, improvementof state of the art was achieved in this realm. Moreover, physical percep-tion obtained from calculator data emphasized that the drawbar pullwas augmented as slip of driving wheels and tractor weight increased.Meanwhile, higher capability in supply of drawbar pull for the 4WDcompared to the 2WD mode of the MFWD tractor was approved. There-fore, it can beﬁnally concluded that the calculator is bene ﬁcial for trac- tor manufacturers and researchers to study and compare the drawbarpull of the MFWD tractors.Declaration of Competing InterestThe authors declare that they have no known competing ﬁnancial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to in ﬂu- ence the work reported in this paper.AcknowledgmentThe authors would like to appreciate expert views of four anony-mous reviewers who meticulously revised the manuscript and furtherenriched content of the paper.References
