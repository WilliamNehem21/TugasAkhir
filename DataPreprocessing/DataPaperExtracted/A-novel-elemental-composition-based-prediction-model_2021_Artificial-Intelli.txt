Keywords:BiocharCa r o m a t i c i t yPrediction modelMachine learningGenetic programmingThe measurement of aromaticity in biochars is generally conducted using solid state13C nuclear magnetic reso- nance spectroscopy, which is expensive, time-consuming, and only accessible in a small number of research-intensive universities. Mathematical modelling could be a viable alternative to predict biochar aromaticityfrom other much easier accessible parameters (e.g. elemental composition). In this research, Genetic Program-ming (GP), an advanced machine learning method, is used to develop new prediction models. In order to identifyand evaluate the performance of prediction models, an experimental data set with 98 biochar samples collectedfrom the literature was utilized. Due to the bene ﬁts of the intelligence iteration and learning of GP algorithm, a kind of underlying exponential relationship between the elemental compositions and the aromaticity of biocharsis disclosed clearly. The exponential relationship is clearer and simpler than the polynomial mapping relation-ships implicated by Maroto-Valer, Mazumdar, and Mazumdar-Wang models. In this case, a novel exponentialmodel is proposed for the prediction of biochar aromaticity. The proposed exponential model appears betterprediction accuracy and generalization ability than existing polynomial models during the statistical parameterevaluation.© 2021 The Authors.

1. IntroductionBiochar is the product of biomass thermochemical conversion in anoxygen limited or depleted environment ( Woolf et al., 2010;Yuan et al., 2017). Biochar has received attention recently as a carbon-negative product and as an effective means to improve soil fertility, aswell as other ecosystem gains such as carbon sequestration to mitigateclimate change (Cao et al., 2014;Cao et al., 2020;Chen et al., 2021; Czech et al., 2021). The aromaticity is one of the most important prop-erty of biochars as it can improve the stability of biochars and affectthe soil environment. The biochars, which possess greater proportionof aromatic C, offer greater chemical recalcitrance and resistance to bio-logical degradation (Smith et al., 2017;Wiedemeier et al., 2015a). The fraction of carbons present in aromatic rings is called aromaticity(Wiedemeier et al., 2015a). Moreover,Han et al. (2014)explored a positive relationship between the aromaticity of biochar C and theircapacity for organic pollutants adsorption. Singh et al. (2012)discov- ered that there is a deﬁnite link between the amount of CO
2generated during a long-term incubation of biochars and their initial proportionfraction of aromatic C. Obviously, quanti ﬁcation of the aromaticity of biochar C is highly signiﬁcant for their further utilization and could bethe basis for business models.To quantitatively characterize aromatic C of biochars, a wide varietyof chemical and physical methods have been used, such as Solid state
13C nuclear magnetic resonance (13C NMR) spectroscopy (McBeath et al., 2011;McBeath et al., 2014), Near-edge X-ray absorptionﬁne structure spectroscopy (NEXAFS) (Keiluweit et al., 2010), Benzene polycarboxylic acid (BPCA) analysis ( Wiedemeier et al., 2013), lipid analysis (Wiedemeier et al., 2015b). However, these techniques are expensive and time-consuming, and only available in research-intensive universities (Baccile et al., 2014;Wiedemeier et al., 2015a). Consequently, simple and robust alternatives have been sought toevaluate the aromaticity of biochars.Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 5 (2021) 133 –141

journal homepage:http://www.keaipublishing.com/en/journals/artificial-intelligence-in-agriculture/Mathematical modelling can be an economically-viable and ef ﬁcient alternative for evaluating the degree of aromaticity, since it is possible toaccurately predict the aromaticity of biochar C by using some basicfeature parameters of biochars. Elemental composition data for any bio-chars are easily obtained and assessed. Due to this reason, Maroto-Valer et al. (1998a)developed a linear mathematical model for the predictionof the C aromaticity of bituminous coal by using atomic H/C ratio. How-ever, the linear Maroto-Valer model has an application limit that H/Conly ranges from 0.5 to 0.8. Therefore, Mazumdar (1999)developed a more accurate prediction model, derived from polyaromatic hydrocar-bons (PAH, only including C and H) with a revised densimetric method,for the C aromaticity by elemental compositions. The model has a betterprediction capacity than the Maroto-Valer model, mainly because for-mer one considered the structure information of C-atom and H-atom(Mazumdar, 1999). However, when the Mazumdar model is used forthe prediction of the C aromaticity of biochars, its prediction capacityis dramatically reduced.Wang et al. (2013)discovered that because Mazumdar's model only considered C- and H-atoms, the model failedwhen applied to biochar. Biochar is a heterogenous material and doesnot only involve C-atom and H-atom, it includes other heteroatoms,such as O, N and S. In this case,Wang et al. (2013)further modiﬁed the Mazumdar model and obtained a specialized prediction model forbiochar aromaticity, which takes into account the in ﬂuence of hetero- atoms of H, O, and N. Unfortunately, the generalization abilities of themodiﬁed model is also limited, when the H/C ratio of biochars is morethan 1.0. Therefore, developing new prediction model for biochararomaticity with higher generalization abilities is greatly necessary.Machine learning can effectively perform a modelling task by usingartiﬁcial intelligence algorithms. The machine learning methods directly“learn”from raw experimental data and develop the functional relation-ships among the data, even if the physical meaning is unknown or thereis no any prior knowledge about the nature of the underlying relation-ships (Goldberg et al., 2015;Kankar et al., 2011). Because of these advanced features, the intelligence method has been used to predictbiochar yield (Cao et al., 2016), to identify inorganic phosphor host(Zhuo et al., 2018), to study nanomaterial toxicity (Winkler et al., 2014), as well as to optimize magnetoelastic Fe –Ga alloy microstructure (Liu et al., 2015). In practice, the adopted intelligence algorithms in-clude Artiﬁcial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine(SVM), Bayesian Network (BN), and Random Forest (RF) ( Cao et al., 2016;Jha et al., 2017;Liu et al., 2015;Pan and Pandey, 2016;Winkler et al., 2014;Zhuo et al., 2018), etc. Although these algorithms are strongintelligent modelling methods with a wide applicability, the developedmodels are“black box”models whose structures and parameters do notsupply any insight into the phenomena underlying the data beingmodeled (Jha et al., 2017
;Patil-Shinde et al., 2014). Beside“black box” intelligent algorithms, Genetic Programming (GP) as the advanced sub-category of machine learning methods has the ability to obtain modelswith clear mathematical expression (analytical models) ( Bagheri et al., 2012;Ghugare et al., 2014;Pandey et al., 2015). More importantly, GP is capable of automatically arriving at an optimized mathematic modelwithout making any assumptions regarding the structure and parame-ters of the developing model. The most attractive feature of GP algo-rithm is that, depending on the nature of dependencies (whetherlinear or nonlinear) in the developing data (experimental data), thetechnique by itself can choose a suitable model that optimally ﬁts the developing data based on Darwinian theory of natural selection ( Faris and Sheta, 2013;Pandey et al., 2015;Sharma and Tambe, 2014). During the modiﬁcation of the Mazumdar model by consideringstructure information of heteroatoms (e.g., H, O, and N), there wereintroduced several ideal assumptions. For instance, one C=O bondwas replaced by two C–H bonds and one N atom was replaced by a Catom for the case with high C/N ratios ( Wang et al., 2013). Considering ideal assumptions may cause some key model information to be ig-nored, which might be the reason why the prediction capacity of themodiﬁed Mazumdar model is not satisfactory for practical application.Just as discussed above, during the development of GP-based model,the model structure is not speciﬁed in advance. Therefore, it is possibleto identify a suitable prediction model with higher generalizationabilities. Accordingly, the principal objectives of this research are:(1) to develop elemental composition based prediction models forbiochar aromaticity with higher generalization abilities, and (2) to dis-cover new mapping relationships and rules between the elementalcompositions and C aromaticity of biochars.2. Methods2.1. Data collectionTo develop robust prediction models for the C aromaticity ofbiochars, the experimental data including 98 biochar samples derivedfrom13C NMR spectroscopy were collected from previous literatures(Baldock and Smernik, 2002;Brewer et al., 2011;Cao et al., 2012; Enders et al., 2012;Kaal et al., 2012;Keiluweit et al., 2010;Manna et al., 2020;McBeath et al., 2014;Singh et al., 2012;Wang et al., 2013; Wiedemeier et al., 2015a;Yue et al., 2017), and the detailed data are provided in the supplementary material ﬁle (Table S1). The biochars characteristics are diverse because of different feedstock (e.g. 24 kindsof biomass) and different pyrolysis conditions (charring temperature,heating rate, and holding time). In this case, the database covers awide distribution of C aromaticity and elemental composition. Forexample, C aromaticity ranges from 0.1000 –1.0000, and the ranges of H/C, O/C, N/C atomic ratios are 0.0249 –1.8076, 0.0171–0.7166, 0.0006–0.0415, respectively.In order to develop C aromaticity prediction models, the abovecollected experimental data were divided into two data sets, e.g. train-ing set and testing set. The training set was employed to identify themodel parameters, and the testing set was utilized for the evaluationof the model performance (Cao et al., 2016). To ensure the effectiveness of the developed model, the training and testing sets were chosen ran-domly. In this research, 60 samples (about 60% of the prepared data)were randomly selected as the training set, and the rest 38 sampleswere taken as the testing set.2.2. Modelling methods2.2.1.

The modi ﬁed model taken into account the presence of heteratom groups of O and N; OneC=O bond is replaced by 2C–H bonds and one N atom is replaced by aC atom. In this research, the modiﬁed model is referred as Mazumdar-Wang model.2.2.2. Genetic programming modelling methodGP simulates Darwin's theory of biological evolution: “survival of the ﬁttest”and“genetic propagation of characteristics ”; it is an intelligent evolution strategy which automatically evolves computer programs tosolve the task without specifying the structure of the solution in ad-vance (Baumes et al., 2009;Gandomi et al., 2015). Hence, the advantage of GP modelling method is that not only the parameters of models areidentiﬁed automatically but also it can identify the structure of models.Herein, we consider a multiple input-single output (MISO)predicting task. Modelling data set is,D¼x
1,y1 ðÞ,x 2,y2Þ,⋯,x N,yNÞðg,ðfð 4ÞincludingNdata patterns, wherex
n(n=1 , 2 ,⋯,N)i sa nM-dimensional input vector (x
n=[x n1,xn2,⋯,x nM]T), andy nis the corresponding model output. Using the data setD, the GP canﬁnd the exact form and the as- sociated parameters of the unknown MISO model ( f). The general form of the model to be solved by GP is given as,y¼fx,ωðÞ ð5Þwhereω=[ω
1,ω2,⋯,ω Q]d e n o t e saQ-dimensional parameter vector.At the beginning of the GP, a population of candidate solutions israndomly generated to the model identi ﬁcation problem. As seen in Fig. 1(a), a candidate solution is coded with a form of trees (geneexpression trees), which forms a candidate model for the model outputofy
nwhen decoded. The tree structure derives from a root node andinvolves operator nodes and operand nodes. The operator nodes repre-sent mathematical operators, e.g. addition, subtraction, multiplication,division, sine, cosine, exponentiation, etc.; while operand nodes de ﬁne model inputs (x) and parameters (ω). Theﬁtness of each candidate solution for the predicting task is evaluated by its ﬁtness score, which is calculated fromﬁtness functions, such as root mean square error(RMSE). The candidate solutions with high ﬁtness scores are more probably chosen to create a mating pool termed “parents”for the repro- duction of new candidate solutions. The new candidate solutions areproduced from the parents by evolution operation of crossover and mu-tation (Fig. 1(b) and (c)). During crossover operation, a pair of parentsfrom the mating pool is selected randomly; and then two new offspringare obtained by tailoring each parent tree at a random point and mutu-ally exchanging the tailored branches between the parents. The cross-over operation is addressed with a pre-speci ﬁed probability value termed“crossover probability”. For mutation operation, the changesare applied to the operator and operand nodes of the parent selectedrandomly to generate a new offspring. The mutation operation is alsoconducted with a pre-speciﬁed probability termed“mutation probabil- ity”, which is usually of a small probability. In this reproduction anditeration way, the satisﬁed predicting model is developed automa-tically. The detailed implementation processes of the algorithm areavailable in literatures (Faris and Sheta, 2013;Pandey et al., 2015; Patil-Shinde et al., 2014).2.3. Model performance evaluationsTo evaluate the capabilities of the developed models, ﬁve statistical parameters (e.g. AAE, MAE, RMSE, R2,a n dρ) were employed. AAE, MAE, RMSE, R
2,a n dρare widely adopted statistical parameters and re-spectively represent the Average Absolute Error, Maximum AbsoluteError, Root Mean Squared Error, coefﬁcient of determination, and corre-lation coefﬁcient. These coefﬁcients are deﬁned as follows (Cao et al., 2016;Gandomi et al., 2013a):AAE¼

Moreover, because correlation coef ﬁcient,ρ,w i l ln o t change signiﬁcantly via shifting the predicted output of a modelequally, and error functions, such as AAE and RMSE, only indicate theerror not the correlation. Therefore, a comprehensive performanceindex (β) is usually used for model performance evaluation ( Gandomi et al., 2016):β¼

Mazumdar-Wang modelLeast square method is utilized for the identi ﬁcation of the model parameters (αin Eq.(1)andθin Eq.(3)), which is implemented handily by using thelsqcurveﬁtfunction in MATLAB software; the identiﬁed pa- rameters ofαandθare equal to 0.0960 and 0, respectively. Fig. 2shows the performance scattered plots of the model on training and testingdata sets, and the corresponding statistical parameters are listed inTable 2.The tight cloud of points about 45

2= 0.9130). However, there is obvious difference between the model parameters obtainedin this research (α=0.0960,θ=0) and those developed byWang et al. (2013)(α=0.110,θ=0.290). The primary difference isabout the model parameter of molar ratio ( θ).Wang et al. (2013) has revealed that molar ratio,θ, is actually not constant, and changeswith biochar structure: biochars obtained at low temperature have aH. Cao, Y.J. Milan, S.H. Mood et al. Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 5 (2021) 133 –141
135larger fraction of organic O existing as C –O (accounting for almost 100% of total CO bonds whenθ= 0), while those obtained athigh temperature have a higher fraction of organic O as C=O (uptoθ= 1). In this research, there is a quite number of low tempera-ture biochar samples and the atomic ratio of H/C reaches a maximalvalue of 1.8076, butWang et al. (2013)just considered biochars with H/C less than 1. Therefore, we have utilized a wider samplerange which could be the reason for the difference of modelparameters.3.2. GP-based modelsFor the identiﬁcation of GP-based C aromaticity models, H/C, O/C, N/C are considered as the input parameters. During the training of themodel, the population size and the maximum number of the generationwere set as 300 and 1000, respectively. To select the parent genes fromthe pool of available solutions, the tournament selection strategy wasadopted (Pandey et al., 2015). The tournament size is set to 4. The de-tailed parameters of the GP algorithm are given in Table 1, which have

136been examined until there was no longer signi ﬁcant improvement in the performance of the GP-based models. Three alternative models(expression trees) were determined by considering their correspondingﬁtness scores and model complexities (see Fig. 3). As shown in theFig. 3, the proposed GP-based C aromaticity predic-tion models are created by the arrangement of operators, variables, andconstants. we canﬁnd that those models have same root node,subtraction operation, and then the root node connects different sub-programs (genes) to form theﬁnal prediction models. Any individualaspect of the problem to be modeled is accentuated by each of the sub-programs so that a meaningful overall solution is identi ﬁed (Faris and Sheta, 2013;Sharma and Tambe, 2014). In this way, the important in- formation underlying in the problem could be achieved via each of theevolved subprograms.Fig. 4shows the comparison of the experimental against predicted Caromaticity values from the three prediction models, and the corre-sponding performance evaluation parameters are given in Table 2.I ti s interesting to notice that all three GP-based models have better predic-tion performances than the Mazumdar-Wang model, due to lower AAE,MAE, RMSE, and comprehensive performance index ( β), as well as higher R2and correlation coefﬁcient (ρ). GP-I model predicts the C aro- maticity using a polynomial combination of H/C and O/C; GP-II and GP-III models indicate that there are exponential relationships between theC aromaticity and the elemental atom ratios. Moreover, GP-III model be-lieves N/C has inﬂuence for the aromaticity prediction, and considers itseffect in the model.For further veriﬁcation of the GP-based models, box-and-whisker di-agrams of the prediction errors in testing set were conducted, as showninFig. 5. Box-and-whisker diagram is a standardized way of displayingthe distribution of data based on aﬁve number summary (“minimum”, ﬁrst quartile (Q1), median, third quartile (Q3), and “maximum”), whichFig. 2.Performance scattered plots Mazumdar-Wang model with α=0.0960 andθ=0: (a) on training data set and (b) on testing data set.

137can quantitatively describe features of the prediction errors to analysisthe accuracy and reliability of the models. Obviously, GP-II and GP-IIImodels outperform the GP-I and Mazumdar-Wang models. GP-II andGP-III have smaller median values (0.0017 and 0.0075) than GP-I andMazumdar-Wang models (0.0165 and 0.0113), which means the errorcentres of former two models are closer to zero. Moreover, there areno outliers for the predictions of GP-II and GP-III models when theerror distributions are addressed. Regarding the structure of models,GP-II and GP-III models predict the C aromaticity by exponential func-tions of elemental atom ratios, but GP-I and Mazumdar-Wang modelsutilize polynomial combinations. It is obvious that exponential modelshave better prediction accuracy and generalization capabilities overpolynomial models for the prediction of the C aromaticity. These resultsimplicate that there exists an exponential relationship between theFig. 4.Experimental versus predicted C aromaticity values using the GP-based prediction models: (a) GP-I model on training data set, (b) GP-I model on testi ng data set, (c) GP-II model on training data set, (d) GP-II model on testing data set, (e) GP-III model on training data set, and (f) GP-III model on testing data set.H.

138elemental compositions and C aromaticity, which can more accuratelycharacterize the underlying rule and information for the prediction ofbiochar aromaticity.3.3. Sensitivity analysis of GP-II and GP-III modelsThe above statistical results (seeTable 2andFigs. 4 and 5) clearly in- dicate GP-II and GP-III models have better prediction performances overGP-I and Mazumdar-Wang models. Moreover, the results also showthat GP-II and GP-III models possess comparable prediction perfor-mances. For instance, during the veriﬁcation in testing set data, GP-II has smaller median value, but at the same time has larger MAE andRMSE; and the two models have almost equal comprehensive perfor-mance index (β). The primary difference of the two models is GP-IIImodel includes the contribution from the input parameter of N/C forthe C aromaticity prediction, which results in a model with greater com-plexity. But GP-II model does not take into account the in ﬂuence of N/C, and has a simple and clear model structure (see Fig. 3). To consider the inﬂuence of different input parameters, we conducted a sensitivity anal-ysis for the two models.The sensitivity (S
i) of each input parameter is expressed as follow(Gandomi et al., 2013b):S
i¼100/C2Ni
∑nj¼1Nj, ð12ÞN
i¼fi i minmax , ð13Þin whichf
max(xi)a n df min(xi) are respectively the maximum and mini-mum value of the predicted output (i.e. C aromaticity) over the i
thinput domain, where other input parameters are equal to their mean values.Table 3presents the results of above analysis for the GP-II and GP-IIImodels. Obviously, the inﬂuence of N/C for the C aromaticity predictionis highly small, which can be ignored, because its sensitivity for the out-puts of the GP-III model is only 2.23%. Therefore, GP-II model should bethe best alternative among these models for the prediction of biochararomaticity on account of excellent predicting capacity and simplemodel structure.Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis ( Table 3) also clearly demon- strates that H/C dominantly determines the prediction of biochar aro-maticity because of larger sensitivity weight over O/C. That could bean important reason for the fact that H/C is widely used as an approxi-mating aromatic index (Baldock and Smernik, 2002;Cai et al., 2019; Hammes et al., 2006;Keiluweit et al., 2010;Wiedemeier et al., 2015a). Fig. 6(a) shows 3D distribution of the biochar aromaticity under theprediction of GP-II model, andFig. 6(b) is the corresponding growingpathway of the biochar aromaticity with the decrease of H/C. As far aswe know, as pyrolysis temperature increases, raw biomass experiencescharring processes, such as dehydration, depolymerization, volatiliza-tion and crystallization, eventually leading to the formation of H and Odepleted aromatic C structures (Chen and Yuan, 2011;Fang et al., 2014;Wiedemeier et al., 2015a;Xiao et al., 2016). In this case, the biochar aromaticity increases with decreasing of H/C. In addition, thesensitivity of C aromaticity for O/C reduces with the decrease of H/C(the red shadow area inFig. 6(b) becomes narrow with the decreaseTable 2Performance evaluation parameters for the three GP-based C aromaticity prediction models.Data set Parameters M-W model GP-I model GP-II model GP-III modelTraining (N= 60) Average Absolute Error (AAE) 0.0677 0.0537 0.0529 0.0547Maximum Absolute Error (MAE) 0.2155 0.1471 0.1439 0.1412Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) 0.0938 0.0725 0.0701 0.0736Coefﬁcient of determination (R

139of H/C), which primarily is due to the formation of similar molecularstructures (tiny aromatic cluster graphene-like structures) at relativehigh pyrolysis temperature (Fang et al., 2014;Maroto-Valer et al., 1998b;McBeath et al., 2011;Wang et al., 2013). Obviously, the predic- tion characteristics of GP-II model is greatly consistent with the re-ported research results. Therefore, the GP-II model is an excellentprediction models for biochar aromaticity with high predicting accuracyand generalization ability.4. ConclusionsThe presented results clearly indicate that, compared with polyno-mial models (e.g. Mazumdar-Wang model), the proposed exponentialmodels (see GP-II and GP-III models) can more accurately characterizethe underlying mapping relationship between the elemental composi-tions and the C aromaticity of biochars. Particularly, GP-II model notonly has high predicting accuracy and generalization ability, but alsopossesses a simple model structure. Furthermore, the research demon-strates that mathematical modelling has high potential utility as a pow-erful tool for predicting biochar aromaticity using easily accessiblefeature parameters of biochars, such as elemental compositions, whichcan greatly save experimental time and cost. Especially, GP intelligencemodelling method can accurately identify suitable alternatives withclear mathematic expressions.Author statementHongliang Cao conducted most of the modelling work and writing ofthis manuscript.
