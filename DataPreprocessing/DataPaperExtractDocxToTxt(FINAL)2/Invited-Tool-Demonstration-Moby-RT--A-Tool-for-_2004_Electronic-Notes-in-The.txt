Abstract
Moby/RT is a graphical design tool for PLC-Automata, a special class of hierarchical real-time automata suitable for the description of distributed real-time systems. These specifications are (not exclusively) implementable on a widely used hardware platform, so-called Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs). We briefly present the modelling language in use and some features of Moby/RT, like code generation for different implementation platforms and several validation methods (including formal verification). The latter features require abstracting translations into Timed Automata and “reabstracting” interpretations of results.
