We report the multi-Fano interference obtained through the simultaneous acquisition of bright and dark states in different phase transitions of Eu3+: BiPO4 (7:1, 6:1, 1:1, and 0.5:1) and Eu3+:
NaYF4 (1:1/4) crystals. We employ multi-dressed spontaneous four-wave mixing and multi- dressed fluorescence (multi-order) to optimize the  strong  photon-phonon  nested  dressing
effect resulting in more obvious multi-Fano interference. Firstly, the multi-Fano is produced through interference in continuous and multi- bound states. Secondly, five multi-Fano dips originate from nested five dressings (one photon and four phonons) under symmetrical splitting of 7F1 energy level. We depict that the pure H-phase (0.5:1) sample exhibits the strongest photon- phonon dressed effect (five Fano dips). Further, we investigate high-order non-Hermitian exceptional points in multi-Fano interference by adjusting the ratio of Rabi-frequency to de-phase rate through nested photon and phonon dressing. Our experimental results are validated by theoretical simulations, which may be applied to designing optoelectronic devices such as non- Hermitian multi-Fano interferences (multi- channel) router.

INTRODUCTION
In recent times, there has been a notable surge in research efforts on Fano resonance, primarily driven by its extensive range of material applications within the realms of physical, chemical, and biological sciences. 1–7. There is significant potential for the application of structures with Fano resonance that we can expect in the field of hybrid photonics and nano- photonics related to the coupling of light with various particles and quasi-particles such as phonons, electrons, spins, excitons, and mechanical degrees of freedom8. In Fano interference, interference of a discrete quantum state with a continuum of states sharing the same energy leads to the appearance of asymmetric line shapes in the measured excitation spectra, which can be characterized by
a Fano ‘shape’ parameter, which was first observed in experiments exciting rare gas atoms to Rydberg states9,10. Fano lineshapes serve as essential spectroscopic indicators that provide quantitatively insights into the structural and dynamic properties of physical objects, spanning from nuclei to three-dimensional solids and liquids.
In recent studies, there has been a special emphasis on exploring higher-order Exceptional points (EP)11-13 and Parity Time (PT) symmetric systems that involve alternating Gain and Loss 14-
18. These systems have shown potential for effectively controlling non-Hermitian multi-Fano interference. The applications of Fano resonance encompass various domains, including the utilization of linear and nonlinear dielectric nano resonators, 2D materials19-21, slow light optomechanical	nanocavities22,	Dirac

semiconductors with ultrafast dynamics of phase and topology23, Fano-lasers and spacers24,25, Fano devices26,27. Being so sensitive to changes in geometry and surroundings, Fano-based devices provide major implementation hurdles despite being an essential component of effective sensors.
In a bid to address this challenge, there has been significant recognition of the merits of exploiting rare-earth ion-doped crystals for the advancement of integrated quantum circuits. The lifetime, coherence time, and spectral resolution of doped crystals such as Eu3+: YPO4, Pr3+: Y2SiO5, and Eu3+: BiPO4 can be precisely controlled through the nonlinear process28,29. But, among them Eu3+: BiPO4 is the best candidate due to the longest coherence among other doped crystals owing to photon-phonon dressing30-33. The functional crystal of BiPO4 has three different crystal structures, namely, hexagonal phase (HP, space group: Po3121), low- temperature monoclinic phase (LTMP, space group: P21/n), and high-temperature monoclinic phase (HTMP, space group: P21/m)34,35. The phase transition of BiPO4 from LTMP or HTMP to HP occurs by continuously doping Ln3+ ions. Our research investigates the effective manipulation of the phase transition, which results in the identification of the novel phenomena of multi- Fano resonances controlled through photon- phonon interaction and multi-dressing effect. However, all of the spectral Fano interferences that have been previously reported involved a single Fano interference arising from the interaction between one continuous state and one bound state, solely caused by external photon dressing.
In this paper, we report the complex
relationship between novel multi-Fano interference and phase transitions of ion-doped microcrystals (Eu3+: BiPO4/Eu3+: NaYF4). Our results show that each BiPO4 fine structure energy level exhibits distinct lattice vibrations, which result in different phonon frequencies. As
a consequence, the number of dressing levels varies, leading to the observation of multi-Fano interferences. The evolution of five Fano interferences from a single Fano interference was observed by precisely controlling the interaction between a continuous state and multi-bound states using laser power, temperature, and gate position (GP). In our experiment, single laser excitation results in a single Fano dip caused by the self-dressing effect, whereas multi-dressing is generated from photon-phonon multi-Fano interference. We realize the non-Hermitian controlled higher- order exceptional points (EPs), which can be defined by real and imaginary quantization alignment. We apply our outcomes to suggests a non-Hermitian multi-channel router and show that broadband peak input fluorescence (FL) to multi-Fano output can be achieved. This study explores extensively into the correlation between thermal-phonon dressings and multi- Fano interference in ion-doped microcrystals, with potential applications in the development of optoelectronic devices.
EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
In our experiment the molar ratio (PO43-: [Bi3+ + Eu3+]) of doped ions is adjusted with different concentrations of Hexagonal- (H) and monoclinic (M) phase to obtain different phase transitions of BiPO4 nanocrystals (7:1, 6:1, 1:1, 0.5:1) as shown in Fig. S1(a-f) (See Supply Information for detailed physical images of the samples). The (7:1, 6:1, 1:1) BiPO4 crystals with C1 point group site-symmetry has a proportion of M-phase whereas the concentration of H-phase is high in (0.5:1) BiPO4 sample (C2 symmetry) resulting in more lattice vibrating phonon36,37. The Eu3+: NaYF4 (YF43-: [Na3+ + Eu3+] =1:1/4) has
pure H-phase with Cs symmetry. The transition between H-phase to M-phase has been achieved by increasing the phosphate ion (PO43−) concentration in the Eu3+: BiPO4 system while

different crystal phases are synthesized by adjusting the pH values38-42.
In our experiment, samples were held in a cryostat (CFM-102) with temperatures varying from 300K (strong phonon dressing) to 77K (weak phonon dressing) by flowing liquid nitrogen. Figures 1a1 and 1a2 show crystal field (CF) splitting levels of Eu3+: BPO4 and Eu3+: NaYF4, respectively. Figure 1a3 shows photon-assisted crystal field splitting in Eu3+: BPO4/NaYF4. The 7F1 fine structure (J = 1) splits into three levels 7F1, MJ=-
1 (587.3nm), 7F1, MJ=0 (592.3nm), and 7F1, MJ=+1
(597.3nm) under the dressing and crystal field effect of BiPO4. Figure 1b illustrates the sub- energy levels that corresponds to Figure 1a3. Two dye lasers (narrow scan with a 0.04 cm−1 linewidth and broad scan with a 0.08 cm−1 linewidth, R610 dye) pumped by an injection- locked single-mode Nd: YAG laser (Continuum Powerlite DLS 9010, 10Hz repetition rate, 5ns pulse width) were used to generate the two
spectral optical outputs are obtained by scanning laser frequency, while the time-resolved OS obtains temporal optical outputs by fixing DL frequency. The grating motor of DL1 and DL2 is scanned by computer to form the x-axis (wavelength), and the intensity of the excitation spectrum is the average of ten shots from the gated integrator appearing on the y-axis. The optical signal generated is detected at photomultiplier tubes (PMT) via confocal lenses (CL) in Fig. S1(g) (See Supply Information for detailed experimental setup). While PMT2 is positioned close to the sample to detect hybrid signal (FL + ES/AS) with dominant FL emission, PMT1 (near detector position) and PMT3 (far detector position) are precisely positioned to detect the generated in-phase spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) (Fig. 1b). By adjusting the gate position, one can obtain output signals from different energy levels with different lifetimes. The ratio of FL to

under	phase-matched	condition ( k1+k1= kS+kAS ) due to interaction with Eu3+: BiPO4 energy levels. The out-of-phase FL1 and FL2 are generated through E1 (broadband laser) and E2 (narrowband laser), respectively. The pulse generated from Nd3+: YAG laser is used to simultaneously trigger a boxcar gated integrator (G) and oscilloscope (OS). The input

Furthermore, Fano resonance strongly depends upon point group site symmetry of different phases of Eu3+: BiPO4. Figure 1c shows the proposed model of a non- Hermitian multi-channel optical router. Figure 1d shows the dressing-like-Zeeman splitting of 7F1 energy level. For the 7F1 energy level by dressing field quantized rotation, we can get splitting energy levels 7F1, MJ=-1, 7F1, MJ= 0, and 7F1, MJ=+1.

THEORETICAL MODEL
Our proposed model shows that more phonons can couple more energy levels as shown in Fig. 1a3. The excitation from single- and two-lasers shows single Fano dip (self-dressing) and multi-Fano dips (external dressing), respectively. It is worth mentioning that multi- dressing can only be generated from photon- phonon multi-Fano interference, not through
Therefore, more phonon results in effective
dressing36. Our findings reveal the five sharp dips which can only be explained by the combined effect of photon dressing and phonon.

Our theoretical results (Figs. 2g and 2h) validate the multi-Fano evolution (Fig. 2a).

The spectral evolution of two sharp peaks to five Fano interference, recorded at PMT2 by adjusting GP, is displayed in Fig. 2b.

In addition, it is observed that single laser excitation (Fig. 3b2) exhibits a greater number of dressing dips compared to two lasers excitation (Fig. 3b3). This can be attributed to the interaction between the two lasers within the crystal, which reduces the dressing effect, as illustrated in Fig. 2e. The observed outcome is consistent with the findings obtained from the nested three-dressing simulation.  at  1 =50.  The  spectral  signal

Figures 4a and 4b discusses the evolution of SFWM from FL in a hybrid signal for (6:1) and (1:1) Eu3+: BiPO4, respectively. At near GP, the dressing effect is weak, leading to a spectral peak characterized by low resolution and a broad linewidth, as shown in Fig. 4a1. Upon increasing the GP (20μs), an emergence of three Fano dips and two Fano peaks is apparent, (Fig. 4a2), resembling the pattern depicted in Fig. 2a22. The observed phenomenon can be attributed to the reduced impact of dressing detuning, resulting in a decreased photon dressing effect and high SFWM resolution. By further increasing GP (200μs), the three Fano dips become stronger in Fig. 4a3 due to one photon dressing ( | G |2 ) and
two phonon dressings ( | G  |2 , | G  |2 ) as modeled

from Eqs (3-4). As the GP reaches 500μs, the five Fano-dips in Fig. 4a4 originate from energy levels 7F1 symmetrical splitting of one laser excitation.
Figure 4b shows the evolution from a single broad dip to sharp multi-dips for (1:1) Eu3+: BiPO4 under the same experimental conditions as described in Fig. 4a. In comparison to Fig. 4a1, the broad dip is shown in Fig. 4(b1) due to higher
to the FL signal, the SFWM signal exhibits higher resolution. The presence of multiple Fano dips can be readily observed in the signal generated by SFWM).
From our results, we have realized the wavelength division multiplexing of both classical and coherent channels. The non- classical SFWM may be effectively multiplexed with divided Fano dip across a range of 1μs to 500μs. This multiplexing technique enables the routing of identical information across many channels, ranging from one channel (Fig. 4b1) to five channels (Fig. 4b4). A non-Hermitian multi- channel router can be realized by non-Hermitian control real part quantization (Fig. 1c), and the routing process can be achieved by changing the boxcar gate position. Similarly, when GP is at 500μs, the coherent channel output can be multiplexed to five divided Fano dips for routing the same information to different channels. Fig. 4b shows two adjacent dips with relative distance between many dips. Such a phenomenon (pure dip to five Fano dip) is analogous to routing. Such results are used for routing.

Figure 5 shows the evolution from multiple dips to two peaks when the laser of E1 is kept high. Figures 5a and b show five Fano dips resulting from five nested dressings (three dressing in 7F1, MJ =±1 and two dressing in 7F1, MJ =0) in a similar manner to that described in Fig. 4c1. When the laser power is lowered, there is a reduction in photon dressing, which leads to the diminishing of three Fano dips resulting from three distinct fine structure energy levels (7F1, MJ =-1, 7F1, MJ =0, 7F1, MJ =1). This reduction in photon dressing causes the phenomenon illustrated in Fig. 4c4 to also
center of the peak remains unchanged due to strong phonon dressing. When comparing the signal measurements of PMT2 with PMT1 and PMT3, it is observed that the signal measured at PMT2 exhibits a stronger dressing effect. This can be attributed to its proximity to the sample, allowing it to detect fluorescence with a higher amplitude, resulting in a more significant dressing dip. Theoretical results are displayed in Figure 5d in accordance with experimental results (Fig. 5b).
Owing to the above explanations, figure 5 shows similar EP control for SFWM multi-Fano quantization (half-EP control). Figure 5b1 shows channel N=3 (fourth-order) at 7F1, MJ =±1 for the left

Figure 6a shows the EP evolution vs the ratio (Gp1/Γ20) between photon-phonon dressing Rabi-frequency and transverse de-phase rate between level |2> and |0>. The theoretical results correspond to nested double dressing. At Gp1/Γ20=0.5, one energy level splits into a real part and an imaginary part, respectively. At internal dressing G1/Γ20=0.5, the real and imaginary parts are split in Figs. 6a3, a4, respectively. The splitting of the real part and the
imaginary part of the nested double dressing does not occur simultaneously. When the third- order splitting (G1/Γ20) occurs in the real part (Fig. 6a3), the corresponding imaginary part (Fig. 6a4) will have the second-order splitting (Gp1/Γ20). Thus, the real part splitting is larger than the imaginary part splitting. The imaginary part is nonlocal, more degenerate and non-Abelian, and highly symmetric. The real part is local, less degenerate and Abelian, and low symmetric.

More importantly, the real part is changed from local, Abelian, and more degenerate to non-local,

non-Abelian, and less degenerate in third-order systems. The dominance of real part splitting (G>Г) shows high-order router, however, the dominance of imaginary part splitting (Г>G) shows low-order router. The non-Hermitian Exception Point (EP) is a point without dressing. Such exceptional point can be achieved by varying various external parameters. Such EP can be achieved by changing different external parameters. The GP is the primary parameter. When the GP is changed from middle (hybrid) to far (SFWM), there is an existence of the EP between hybrid and SFWM. For the nested double dressing, the dressing term is already solved, and it is converted into a univariate cubic equation to be solved, so three eigenvalues are obtained. But in our model, the photon dressing like Zeeman splits three energy levels in Fig. 1a4. The 7F1, MJ =-1 and 7F1, MJ =+1 energy levels are nested dressed by two phonons (phonon1 and phonon2) and the other two phonons (phonon3 and phonon4), respectively. One photon (photon1) dressed 7F1, MJ =0 energy level. So, eight eigenvalues can be obtained by solving the equations of two nested double dressing and one single dressing. Moreover, our experimental results are a subset of the theoretical simulation.
Figures 6c, d show the spectral intensity
signal obtained from (0.5:1) Eu3+: BiPO4 (C2 symmetry) and H-phase Eu3+: NaYF4 (Cs symmetry), respectively. In this experiment, the competition between real a and imaginary ib eigenvalues based on nested photon-phonon dressing is discussed. The detailed model of EPs control based on different laser dressing are depicted in Table S1 to S4 (supplementary file). It is worth mentioning that the GP affects the de- phase rate (Γ) at the spectral signal. In other words, the ratio of G and Γ can be tuned by changing the GP. In Figs. 4c, Fig. 5b1, and Fig. 6c1, one can observe the visible five Fano dips due to
the dominance of the nested dressing ( |G |2 , |G  2
second Fano dips come from phonon1 and phonon2 dressing. The central Fano dip results from photon1 dressing. The fourth and fifth Fano dips can be explained by phonon3 and phonon4 dressing. Compared to the other four Fano dips, the fifth Fano dip is the strongest (Figs. 4a4) due to photon dressing (similar to Figs. 4c1, c2 and 5a1, b1).

The spectral signal measured at PMT2 obtained from c, d; (0.5:1) sample of Eu3+: BiPO4 and Eu3+: NaYF4 when E1 is scanned from 572.4 nm to

d (1ms, 6ms,10ms, 25ms)) at 200ns gate width and 300 K temperature at power= 9mW, respectively.
When the GP reaches 5ms, one can observe
the two sharp peaks in Fig. 6c3 corresponding to EP where G and Γ are equal due to the dominance of crystal field splitting (Fig. 1a2), validated by theoretical results in Fig. 6(a). The visible three Fano dips observed in Fig. 2a12, Figs. 4a2, b2 and Fig. 6c3 are attributed to the stronger nested three dressing (photon1- phonon1-phonon2 atomic coherence coupling in Fig. 1a4) than crystal field splitting. The evolution from three Fano dips to two sharp EP peaks, to five Fano dips corresponds to Figs. 1a2, a4. Figures 6b1 and b2 are the 3D simulation results

corresponding to the real and imaginary parts of 2D simulations (Fig. 6a and b), respectively.
Lastly, Fig. 6c exhibits fourth-order (N=3) at 7F1, MJ=±1, which corresponds to four eigenvalues in a univariate quartic equation (S4 Galois group)
[38] with three dressing, and one third-order (N=2) EP control at 7F1, MJ =±1 corresponding to four eigenvalues in a univariate cubic equation (S3 Galois group) with two dressing for left and right peak, respectively. Figure 6d1-d4 exhibits one third-order (N=2) EP control for each peak.
CONCLUSION
In summary, this research examined the phenomenon of multi-Fano dips and demonstrated that their behavior can be regulated by higher-order exceptional points control in non-Hermitian systems. Additionally, we demonstrated the relationship between multi-Fano interference and the photon-phonon nested dressing effect for various Eu3+: BiPO4 samples. This research establishes the categorization of the multi-Fano resonance between discrete and continuous states into three distinct types (dressed MFL, hybrid, and dressed SFWM Fano interference), which can be controlled through the gate position (ratio of MFL and Stokes). Moreover, our experimental results suggest a scheme to achieve a higher channel equalization ratio of about 80%.
