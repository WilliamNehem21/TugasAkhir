Oil-type transformers (OTT) are used more than dry-type transformers, based on cost in the transmission and distribution of electrical energy. Therefore, this usage density increases the importance of cost in OTT. Weight is important in transformer cost. The weight of the transformers depends on the variable parameters of the weights of the core and windings, C (iron cross section conformity factor) and s (cur- rent density), respectively. In this study, unlike the previous heuristic optimization studies, an innovative and complementary optimum weight was obtained by using the Gray Wolf - Whale Optimization hybrid algorithm for both distribution type and power transformer type OTT. A weight reduction of 44% and approximately 14% in power transformers was achieved. It was determined that this decrease in weights provided the same reduction in OTT costs. The comparison test of the study was performed both with the values of other algorithms and statistically.

Introduction

Power and distribution OTTs are static system machines that decrease and increase the voltage level of the generated electricity without changing the power and frequency values.
Transformers are divided into many subclasses based on their different characteristics. Power and distribution transformers that are widely used in industry are oil type transformers and dry type transformers based on the type of cooling. OTT transformers shown in Fig. 1 are more in number as they are more economical than dry type transformers among the distribution and power transformer types. This has caused OTTs to be included in many studies in every aspect in the literature. Studies have been con- ducted on operating systems, fault detections, optimization of these electrical machines. OTT design optimization is the detailed calculation of transformer component characteristics based on pre- scribed specifications, using available materials economically to achieve lower cost, lower weight, reduced size, and improved oper- ating performance [1]. In these optimization studies, results were obtained by using meta-heuristic algorithms, taking into account the constraints for certain purposes. The heuristic algorithms such as Genetic Algorithm (GA), which is one of the most well-known algorithms [2], Partial Swarm Optimization (PSO) [3], Ant Colony Algorithm (ACA) [4], Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) Algorithm [5], Fire- fly Algorithm (FA) [6],Simulated Annealing (SA) [7], Gravitational

Search (GSA) [8] have been included in many studies to adapt designs, costs and weight optimization of transformers.
From these studies, it was determined that the weight of a dry- type distribution transformer was reduced by using the optimal value variable parameters in the study using genetic algorithm [10]. Similarly, genetic algorithm optimization was developed by using variable parameters s and C to optimize the weight of oil- filled distribution transformers [11]. In another study using parti- cle swarm optimization, a distribution type dry type transformer weight was optimized with the same variable parameters [12]. Optimal values were obtained by using artificial neural networks in dry-type transformer design [13] In dry-type transformer, better results were obtained with firefly algorithm, one of the current heuristic algorithms, and better weight optimization compared to previous algorithms [14] micro genetics for optimal design trans- former optimization studies with an algorithm-based design also included positive results [15].
In addition to these studies, Gray Wolf Optimization (GWO) [16], which is a part of the hybrid algorithm developed in 2014 and applied in this article, is also included in transformer design optimization.
GWO is good at reaching optimum parameters in less iterations in both dynamic and static operating conditions, and the time response is fast in systems where it is applied.
In these features, an improved hybrid GWO is proposed to increase the performance of support vector machine used in trans- former fault diagnosis [17].

In another study dealing with power loss and weight reduction in transformers, it was investigated that GWO provided 3.76% reduction in 1000 kVA transformer weight in optimization with heuristic algorithms [18].
Likewise, a part of the hybrid algorithm, the Whale Optimiza- tion Algorithm (WOA) [19] which was developed in 2016, has an efficient, virtuous global search capability, slow but highly accu- rate convergence performance in solving real-world optimization problems.
In transformer optimization studies using WOA, it was deter- mined that, similar to GWO, a hybrid structure was created with genetic algorithm by using support vector machine optimization used in transformer fault diagnosis, and fault diagnosis results were realized by 94.05% and the margin of error was reduced by 5% [20]. In a different study, WOA was used in transformer fault diagnosis with an extreme learning machine and it was deter- mined that it could increase fault diagnosis efficiency by optimiz- ing power transformers [21].
Furthermore, heuristic optimization algorithms such as FA, ABC, GWO, WOA etc., recently created in the field of transformers, are utilized for solving a variety of issues in electrical-electronics, com- puter, and mechanical engineering.
GWO has been used to increase the performance of an opti- mized model of hybrid kernel function relevance vector machine (HKRVM) for battery prognostics and health management [22], solve problems related to load frequency control in high scale power systems [23], reconfigure the control circuit designed to keep the four-layer chopper placed on the DC connection of the variable speed drive system (VSDS) under control and has yielded better results than previous methods and practices used in the sys- tem [24].
WOA has been used in optimization studies that provide greater accuracy and reliability to the global values of the values obtained in the stability analysis of power systems [25]. In addition to this study, WOA found positive results in finding electric vehicle charg- ing stations with service capacity, and that it was effective for prac- tical positioning, planning projects and reducing social costs [26]. These heuristic algorithms have been created in hybrid struc- tures through different algorithms that can work in harmony, con- sidering their features. With these hybrid algorithm applications, it is aimed to obtain better results than the studies in which the algo-
rithms are applied separately
Based on research that complements this hybridization, the drilling process using a cryogenically treated drill bit on Inconel 718 super alloy was used in the optimization of the parameters
to be used in obtaining minimum surface roughness as well as maximizing the torque and thrust force during the drilling process and provided better results to the systems compared to their cur- rent conditions [27].
In addition, in order to obtain the best values in the optimiza- tion of the systems, studies have been carried out in the definition of facial emotions with the hybridization of the developed whale algorithm and the Teaching-learning-based algorithm in recent years [28]. For static and dynamic crack identification, PSO and gray wolf hybrid algorithms produced optimal results [29]. In a dif- ferent hybrid study, the genetic algorithm and the worm algorithm obtained values that could obtain more optimal peak values in PV systems [30]. The modified gray wolf algorithm and the cuckoo search algorithm provided optimization in low-frequency con- troller design [31].
When the gray wolf algorithm is hybridized through the bee algorithm, a unique algorithm providing general optimization has been created [32]. Workplace scheduling problems were optimally solved through the whale and Levy flight application with a similar optimization application [33].
The hybrid Gray wolf-whale optimization algorithm mentioned in this article is used in several investigations, In the cloud task scheduling problem, it was aimed to benefit from the advantages of both algorithms in order to minimize the costs, energy con- sumption and the total execution time required for the task imple- mentation, as well as to improve the resource usage, and an improvement was achieved.[34].
Another study, investigated if the hybrid GWO-WOA algorithm, which was compared with the Partical swarm optimization algo- rithm in determining the robot model parameter, provided an improvement in parameter determination [35]. Similarly, for the Leader-Follower Robot (LFR), which is a different robot, the average was calculated while obtaining the model obtained through the gray wolf algorithm It was determined that the squared error value improved from 73.6% to 78% with the hybrid gray wolf whale algo- rithm [36].
A holistic multi-objective optimization framework(MO-HPM) is proposed for the participation of charged electric vehicles in clear- ing the harmonic power market in a microgrid properly, and the study is presented in the field of electric machines. The proposed study focuses on the ability of harmonic balancers to simultane- ously optimize conflicting targets, including the total distortion pay function and the average of the total harmonic distortion, while meeting the constraints associated with the grid, instru- ments, and market price. In the study, a new hybrid algorithm con- sisting of whale optimization, gray wolf optimization, and differential evolution is proposed to create the new market frame- work, and it is examined whether using the algorithm for various defined situations may be the best option for solving mathematical and technical problems, especially MO-HPM [37].
Hybrid gray wolf-whale algorithm is used to obtain high param- eter values in the improvement of performance parameters in the image encryption model for medical image security in the field of medicine [38].
In another study conducted in the same field, a hybrid heuristic swarm-based support vector machine classifier named Gray Wolf- Whale Optimization Algorithm and Support Vector Machine (GWWOA-SVM) has been proposed for early detection of breast cancer disease. The performance of the proposed model is evalu- ated on various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, speci- ficity, and F1 score. Our model achieves a classification accuracy of 97.721% for the WDBC dataset. This model outperforms the 92.98% validation rate obtained in the study with PSO, the 96.65 validation rate obtained with WOA, etc., showing that better results are obtained and the hybrid algorithm has better perfor- mance [39].



From these studies, a new approach has been developed, which allows to increase the performance of the hybrid gray wolf-whale algorithm by applying the chaos theory. Better results were obtained from the study compared with other algorithms and gray wolf-whale hybridization [40].
It is examined from the studies in which hybrid algorithms can produce better results compared to the performance of the current heuristic algorithm. According to this evaluation, the studies of hybrid heuristic algorithms used in the optimization of OTT weight, which is the main subject of the study, include the objec- tives of weight reduction-cost minimization of parameters. Of these, the optimization of the protection dimensions of oil-type transformers and the optimization of the operating cost by using firefly and ant colony algorithms are examined [41].
In order to improve the cooling performance of the oil used in oil-based transformers, the Taguchi method and Gray Wolf Opti- mization were hybridized and the mixing ratio of various oil types was optimized [42].
Some studies focus on achieving maximum efficiency on a dry
type 100 kVA transformer by optimizing the current density (s)
culations in [44,45] are used. The weight values determined for powers at both the transmission and distribution levels are deter- mined using the following parameters.
It is stated that iron core and copper windings are the two most important parts that make up the weight in OTT. Accordingly, the total weight of OTT (GT) is expressed as follows.
GT = Gcu + Gfe	(1)
where; Gfe indicates iron weight and Gcu indicates copper weight.
The weight of the iron core, which is the first part of the OTT’s weight, is the sum of the weights of the legs and yokes that make up the core.
Gfe = Gfeb + Gfej	(2)
It can be expressed as the sum of the yoke weight (Gfej) and leg weights (Gfeb) in the equation. The equations of the yoke and leg weights here are obtained using the following expressions.

[43].
In the studies reviewed, it has not been observed that the Gray Wolf, Whale algorithm or their hybrid algorithms, which have been developed in recent years, have been applied in design opti- mization studies to improve the performance of OTTs that are widely used in the industry.
Unlike other heuristic algorithms (ABC, FA, ACO, etc.) examined above, Gray Wolf Optimization Algorithm can reach the result it shows quickly with the ability to reach optimum parameters in a limited number of iterations. The Whale Algorithm, on the other hand, works slower than the gray wolf algorithm, but it reaches the optimum value with maximum accuracy and gives better results in verification. It has the ability to converge. It shows that when these algorithms are hybridized with each other, they have a complementary structure.
The OTT weight optimization results of the Gray wolf-whale algorithm to be applied as a hybrid and the advantages such as cost, size and footprint of these values will benefit the OTT design optimization. In conclusion:

The industrial operating cost will be reduced in production of the transformer with optimum weight value,
The performance of the hybrid made with heuristic Whale and Grey Wolf algorithms will be assessed,

Materials and methods

Mathematical model of oil type transformers

While obtaining weights for both power transformer and distri- bution transformer types in OTT, a calculation methodology that makes use of the used materials and assumptions expressed as empirical approaches based on experience during the design is used.
The industrial design parameters of the transformers in this study and the parameters and hypothetical values given in the cal-
Gcu1 = 3.10—5ccuw1q1Lm1	(10)

Gcu2 = 3.10—5ccuw2q2 Lm2	(11)
In these equations, w1 and w2 indicate the coiling numbers of the first and second windings, q1 and q2 indicate the first and sec- ond winding cross sections, s indicates the current density, I1 and I2
indicate the first and second winding currents, ccu indicates the
specific gravity of copper, Lm1and Lm2 indicate the average lengths of the windings.
It can be seen here that s current density value is an important variable affecting the copper winding value and thus the copper weight.



In this case, as shown in (1), the total weight of the transformer will be obtained as follows if the total weights of the primary and secondary windings, the yoke and the legs are indicated separately.
GT = Gcu1 + Gcu2 +Gfeb +Gfej	(12)
The label weight values of the OTT for both distribution trans- formers (50kVA-100kVA) and power transformers (1000KVA) will be determined and compared with the previous weight optimiza- tion value obtained through heuristic algorithms and optimum val- ues obtained through the Whale-Grey Wolf hybrid algorithm, and their accuracy will be statistically determined.
Table 1 shows the label parameters of the 50 kVA, 100 kVA and 1000 kVA OTTs used in this study. The weights of the OTTs are
332.28 kg, 757.81 kg and 1664 kg respectively.

Methods

Grey wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm

The Grey Wolf Algorithm developed by Mirjalili et al.[16] in 2014 is one of the other common population-based intuitive algo- rithms such as the Genetic Algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimiza- tion, Firefly algorithm etc. However, this innovative algorithm has better convergence capability and can reach the optimum point in a shorter time as well as having simple and easily applica- ble features.
The leadership hierarchy used for the implementation of the Grey Wolf Algorithm includes four different dominant grey wolf groups. In the leadership hierarchy seen in Fig. 2, the first layer is
alpha (a) and it represents the leading wolf which is the strongest
and most talented. Beta (b) wolves in the second layer command the other inferior wolves and communicate with alpha wolves. Beta wolves fortify the commands of the alpha, convey them to the inferior wolves, and give feedback to the alpha wolf. Wolves in the third layer are classified as delta wolves (d) which are not included in the other three layers and have to succumb to alpha and  beta  class  wolves  but  dominate  omega  wolves.  Here
a > b > d, and the lowest layer includes omega wolves (x) that
are directed by these grey wolves and will perform the optimiza- tion. x grey wolves make up a large part of the population and are mainly responsible for stabilizing the internal affairs of the population and protecting and monitoring the young wolf popula- tion. This class of wolves is the most dominant group.
The hunting process used for the implementation of the grey wolf algorithm consists of searching for prey, tracking and moni- toring, surrounding, and attacking.
In the Grey Wolf Algorithm, the search for prey is carried out mainly by a, b, d. In optimization, the first optimal solution is con- sidered to be alpha (a), while beta (b) and delta (d) are considered the second and third best solutions, respectively. Omega wolves

(x) follow these three wolves. For the optimal implementation of the algorithm, all grey wolves follow the prey, determine its loca- tion and begin to surround it. (13) and (14) are used for mathemat- ical modelling of this behavior.
Dp = CXp(t) — X(t)	(13)

X(t + 1) = Xp(t) — ADp	(14)
where Dp indicates the wolf’s distance to wolf x, which is the dominant character, or its diameter in a circle, t indicates the num- ber of iterations, X(t) indicate a member of the grey wolf popula- tion, and Xp indicates the current position of the prey. A and C are called coefficient vectors in (13) and (14) and calculated as shown in (15) and (16).
A = 2ar1 — a	(15)

C = 2r2	(16)
where a denotes a coefficient that decreases from 2 to 0 as the iteration progresses while r1 and r2 are numbers that are randomly selected between 0 and 1. Grey wolves (a, b and d) hunt their prey after surrounding it. In other words, they focus on the optimum
point. Fig. 2 shows the hunting strategy of grey wolves.
The |A| dimension determines the optimization mode of the population while the grey wolves are surrounding the prey. When
|A|>1, the wolves will hunt globally; when |A|<1, the wolves will gather for local hunt. Meanwhile, C in the GWO will affect the posi- tion of the prey and therefore the wolves will perform random searching behavior while looking for prey to achieve global optimization.
The positions of grey wolves are determined by (17) and (18) in the hunting mechanism given in Fig. 3.

In these equations, Xa, Xb and Xd indicate the position of the grey wolves. (19) shows the new location of the prey after hunting.

The basic pseudo-code describing the operation of the grey wolf algorithm is as follows (see Fig. 4).

Whale optimization algorithm (WOA)


WOA was developed by Mirjalili and Lewis in 2016 in order to achieve good results in solving problems that could not be solved by deterministic methods [19]. WOA is an optimization approach that simulates the hunting strategies of humpback whales. The bubble hunting strategy inspires what humpback whales use when hunting. Humpback whales generally feed on small shoals of fish. They have a unique hunting strategy. They form bubble clouds by exhaling underwater. Thus, thanks to these bubbles, they gather their prey together. In these bubbles they create, they move towards the surface of the water and continue to form bubbles as they rise to the surface. This way, they ensure that preys stays
inside the bubbles and hide themselves. Fig. 5(a) represents hump-

In the whale optimization algorithm, surrounding the target is considered the optimum solution to be reached. In cases where the optimum solution is not known in optimization problems, it is accepted as the best solution reached or a point around it. In the next step, the positions of the other solutions are updated using the best solution after finding the best solution. The mathe-

Xrand represents a random solution vector selected. Whether global or local searches are to be made is decided according to
the value of vector →A . For vector →A , when A > 1 or A < 1, a point
further away from the best moment can be selected. These cases are considered a global search, and (27) and (28) are applied.

Hybrid Grey Wolf-Whale optimization algorithm (HGWOA)

A hybrid algorithm using the Grey Wolf Algorithm’s prey search method is created in this study to optimize the prey equation of WOA.
It is aimed to calculate the optimum values obtained in the hybrid algorithm equations (19) and the optimum transformer
weight seen in (29) as →X (t + 1) value, which gives the best result.

In this way, the fast and in-population approach of the Grey Wolf Algorithm to find a prey is combined with WOA’s approach that yields the result closest to the optimum value in finding a prey. It will be possible to reduce the operating cost affected by weight through this optimum weight obtained using this hybrid algorithm. Fig. 8. shows the flowchart applied for this study.


Performance of HGWOA in OTT weight optimization

Benchmark test of HGWOA

The HGWOA algorithm created in the paper was tested for effi- ciency by solving 10 functions that are commonly used for opti- mization test problems [16,19]. The average cost function and standard deviation measurements are used to compare HGWOA performance to that of GWO and WOA. The average cost function is used to demonstrate the algorithm’s capacity to discover a global

At the end of the WOA search for the target, the new positions of the solution candidates are determined around a randomly cho- sen solution candidate instead of the best-known point for the glo- bal solution. Its mathematical model is shown in (27) and (28).

Tables 3. shows the mean and standard deviation values derived from ten independent runs. The bolded values represent the best performance (smallest cost function or standard deviation value). Tables III shows that the HGWOA algorithm produces very competitive outcomes. For example, in unimodal functions F2-F6, and multimodal functions F7, F9, HGWOA beats GWO and WOA algorithms.
In the benchmark test of the analysis made at different strengths of OTT, cost function data obtained from the average val- ues of the proposed HGWOA optimization algorithm are included. The convergence curves created according to these values were obtained according to the data of the F1 function and F9 functions used in the test. In Fig. 10 curve, it can be determined that the best values are in HGWOA.Fig. 11.

2.2A/mm2 < s < 3.5A/mm2	(31)
4cm2joules—1/2 < C < 6cm2joules—1/2	(32)
Constraints for 1000kVA and 100kVA OTTs;
3.5 A/mm2 < s < 5 A/mm2	(33)


4 cm2joules—1/2 < C < 8 cm2joules—1/2	(34)
100 random values are assigned to each variable (s, C) within the specified range. The analyses include 100 iterations for HGWOA optimization. Accordingly, weight calculations are per- formed with different s and C values with 100 100 size for each OTT. In the HGWOA algorithm, the hunting population optimized through the Grey Wolf algorithm reaches the best value with 10,000 whales. In this way, the optimum transformer weight value will be obtained as a result of optimization. All parameters of OTT (magnetic current density, specific ampere turn value etc.) used in weight calculation are updated in compliance with the design. These values have been added to calculations in accordance with the OTT types as shows in Table 4.
Furthermore, the weight values obtained with HGWOA are compared with values obtained with classical methods and those obtained with methods used in other studies.
In these comparisons, the algorithms used in the studies in [42] and [43] in 50 kVA OTT weight optimization were compared. BA, FA, and ACO algorithm optimization values were compared with

HGWOA values, together with the optimization values of the orig- inal GWO and WOA algorithms that formed the hybrid algorithm with 50kVA OTT label parameters. it can be seen that the closest values to HGWOA are the original GWO and WOA that make up the algorithm.
For 100kVA OTT, the PSO, SA, GSA results used in [46,47] and the optimization values of the GWO and WOA algorithms are given together with the suggested HGWOA results and compared.
In the optimization of 1000kVA OTT weight parameters in the power transformer class, the optimization values of the BA, ACA, FA and original GWO and WOA algorithms used in the [48,49] studies were compared with the proposed HGWOA optimization values.
Table 5 shows that in the weight optimizations obtained with heuristic algorithms applied according to the power of the trans- formers in the analysis, the values of the HGWOA algorithm further improve the results compared to the values obtained with other algorithms.
Moreover, the compatibility of the values obtained from the study is also verified using the regression method and the least squares method, which are statistical quantitative methods.
Accordingly, Fig. 12. shows the graph of the values obtained by C and s variables in the population in the calculation of the HGWOA weight for 50kVA and 100 kVA distribution OTTs and 1000 kVA power OTT.
It was determined that the values obtained through the HGWOA algorithm which was developed as an innovative algo- rithm with the values given in Table V and which has not been seen in any hybrid studies on transformer optimization before create more optimum values than weight values calculated with the
known classical design methods. While the weight of 50 kVA OTT is 332.28 kg in distribution transformers, whose quantity is quite high among the total number of transformers in the distribu- tion type of electrical energy, this value becomes 264.454 kg after optimization. This value provides 20.4% weight gain. At 100 kVA, the weight decreases from 757.81 kg to 419.83 kg and provides a weight reduction of approximately 44%. In 1000kVA, which is a power transformer, this value decreases from 1664 kg to 1420.33 kg, providing a weight reduction of approximately 14%. Table 6 shows the gains of these weight reductions in relation to the cost values obtained from previous studies. It was determined in the comparisons made in Table 6, which includes the evalua- tions made according to the data in the economic estimation study made in [50], that there will be a cost decrease in approximately the same direction according to the weight values.
When the weight values obtained in the study were compared with the weight values calculated according to the OTT power val- ues in other studies, it was determined that the values obtained through the HGWOA algorithm used in our study are more optimal than the other values. Fig. 13. (a) shows that although the values obtained in previous studies for 50 kVA OTT are better than the values obtained through the classical method, the HGWOA values include more optimal values. As can be seen in Fig. 13(b), it was observed in a comparison performed to a limited extent due to the shortage of studies conducted on 100 kVA OTT that the value obtained by applying the HGWOA algorithm calculates a more optimal weight value.
Fig. 14 shows that, in other studies on 1000 kVA OTT power transformer, the values are compared with the values obtained

by implementing the HGWOA algorithm and a significant optimum value is calculated.
The values constituting the transformer weight could be reduced by performing optimum weight calculation through HGWOA algorithm in both power and distribution OTT transform-
ers, thus decreasing the impact of this weight on the operating costs. This assessment was statistically verified with a test per- formed through the Least Squares method and Regression Analysis using the values obtained in this study and those obtained in other studies. The equations and the R2 value providing information about the graph accuracy are specified on the graphs in the statis- tical evaluation. It is known that the closer the R2 value to 1, the more accurate results the equation yields. Accordingly, the graphs where the R2 value is closest to 1 were verified with the weight values calculated in this study.
In Fig. 15 (a), the equation accuracy in the graph created using the values obtained in studies where 50-kVA weight optimization was performed and the values obtained through HGWOA was determined based on the convergence of R2 value to 1 and the value was found compatible. Likewise, in Fig. 15 (b), although there are not many studies on 100 kVA, the HGWOA value was found to be accurate considering that the values were low. Fig. 16 shows the statistical verification of the values obtained as a result of studies conducted for 1000 kVA power OTT and HGWOA.

Conclusion

OTTs are electric machines that are widely used for conveying and distributing electric power. The place held by these machines in operating costs becomes permanent accordingly. These trans- former costs can be reduced by optimizing weight in an industrial manner. As a result, while operating profitability can be increased, the service life of transformers can be positively affected.
Therefore, this study attempts to optimize weights of OTTs with different power levels by adding the ability of the Grey Wolf Opti- mization to reach the optimal point in the fastest way possible to the ability of the Whale Algorithm, which is an innovative heuristic algorithm, to achieve the value closest to the optimum result. The values to be reduced were calculated as approximately 20.4% to

It was determined that optimization methods where different prominent features were used yielded better results and the results produced more optimal values than the results obtained in other studies. These values were verified by testing through statistical analyses.
In future research, the hybridized GWO and WHO algorithms will be able to leverage their performance to deliver optimal solu- tions for a variety of industrial and experimental situations. Fur- thermore, they will make original contributions to issue solving through the new hybridizations they will create using the newly discovered algorithms.
