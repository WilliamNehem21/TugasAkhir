The article’s highlight is the Markov model of functioning of the centralized wireless information ecosys- tem focused on multimedia streaming. The model describes the stochastic process of joint service by the base transmission station (BTS) of independent streams of multimedia transfer and text data transfer. To assess the effectiveness of the fulfilment of its purpose by the studied ecosystem, a metric of quality parameters is proposed, in particular: - the percentage of lost requests for multimedia transfer; - the per- centage of lost requests for text data transfer; - the average share of the resource of the BTS communi- cation channel involved in the service of multimedia transfers; - the average share of the BTS communication channel involved in the service of text data transfer; - the percentage of censored oper- ating time of the studied system, when the incoming request for multimedia transfer was rejected due to lack of the required share of free resource of the communication channel; - the ratio of the number of lost multimedia transfer requests to the potential number of transfer sessions. The first four parameters are indicators of the reliability of the studied system, and the last two qualitative parameters have a direct economic interpretation. For the studied ecosystem to realize its purpose in conditions of moderate and high load, the model introduced a self-limiting function. This feature allows us to flexibly balance the servicing of transfer sessions of both types, balancing the values of the first two quality indicators. The adequacy of the proposed mathematical apparatus is proved empirically.

Introduction

The leitmotif of the global economy in recent years is the accel- eration of science and technology. The World Bank noted, in partic- ular, the emergence of new end-to-end technologies such as digital design, modelling and integration, high-performance computing, 3D printing, additive manufacturing, advanced materials, robotics, and artificial intelligence, Big Data and Advanced Analytics, Inter- net of Things, augmented and virtual reality, blockchain technolo- gies, industrial biotechnologies, etc.

In developed countries, the creation and implementation of technological and managerial innovations occupy an important place in virtually all economic and social activity areas. Rapidly introduced technologies are becoming increasingly important with growing risks caused by adverse atmospheric, environmental, and biological origin factors. The COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak poses many challenges to the innovation ecosystem and highlights the interconnectedness of both the global and national communities. Thanks to the widespread use of innovation, national economies are finding new ways to support economic growth and ensure a high standard of living. These trends are facilitated by the availabil- ity of effective innovation methods, including through technology transfer.
However, the basis of all these tectonic innovation processes is effectively communicating communities, people, and things. It should be borne in mind that people are natural and comfortable communicating in video conferencing, while IoT devices mostly exchange text messages. As the size of these user audiences in today’s cyberspace grows exponentially, communication tools

and their information systems become bottlenecks in the path of progress. Thus, the study of the functioning of a centralized wire- less information ecosystem (as a basic link of modern info- communication infrastructure), focused on multimedia streaming, is relevant.
In addition, we note that increasing the level of use of a prepaid information transmission resource in a centralized wireless ecosystem while maintaining the required service standards for incoming traffic flows is an important task, the solution of which is necessary for organizing the effective operation of the target net- work infrastructure. At the same time, we take into account that the actors in such an ecosystem are the set of clients (including end devices of IoT sensor arrays), on the one hand, and a wireless network infrastructure base station, on the other hand. The pro- cesses of information interaction are characterized by stochastic and are independent. To simplify the analytical part of the research, we will consider the considered ecosystem as closed. Let us formulate the problem understudy in a descriptive style. It is known [1–5] that when jointly serving narrow-band and broad- band traffic of real-time communication applications, there is an uncontrolled redistribution of the channel resource in favour of application flows with low requirements for the information trans- mission resource. To eliminate the negative consequences of this phenomenon, it is proposed to use either redundancy or separate occupation of the resource of network clusters. For the theoretical substantiation of the procedure for choosing a specific scenario, it is necessary to develop models that describe the consequences of the implementation of these scenarios, as well as methods for cal- culating the values of the qualitative characteristics of using the information transmission resource. This article is devoted to the solution of these important applied problems.


State-of-the-art

The most pressing problem in the field of info-communications is the identification and targeted service of incoming requests. The reliable result of their identity is the basis for the rational choice of means and methods of their effective maintenance. Let us mention only the generally accepted methodologies used to evaluate, model, and identify processes in info-communication systems. These are [1–3,5]: game theory, fuzzy sets, graph theory, Petri nets, digital automata theory, random process theory, and so on.
These methodologies form a toolkit for analyzing the perfor- mance of the studied information systems for a finite censored time. The analysis takes place in the context of determining: 1. The time between failures in the system under study; 2. The num- ber of failures in the study system for the censored period of its operation; 3. The reaction of the studied system to the provoked failures; 4. The reaction of the studied system to complex test effects. In the context of info-communication systems, failures are understood as situations of loss of incoming requests or prema- ture termination of their service.
These methodologies form a toolkit for analyzing the perfor- mance of the studied information systems for a finite censored time. The analysis takes place in the context of determining: 1. The time between failures in the studied system; 2. The number of failures in the studied system for the censored period of its oper- ation; 3. The reaction of the studied system to the provoked fail- ures; 4. The reaction of the studied system to complex test effects. In the context of info-communication systems, failures are understood as situations of loss of incoming requests or prema- ture termination of their service.
Models [6–9] are created with a focus on the description of the first performance indicator. They are based on the mathematical apparatus of time series analysis. Their purpose is to identify the
parameters of the statistical distribution, which best describes the period between failures in the operation of the studied system. The adequacy of such models is determined by the representative- ness of the data sample that characterizes the studied system’s operation. When formalizing such models, only the fact of failure is taken into account without analyzing the causes of its occur- rence and possible consequences.
Models [10–13] were created focusing on the description of the second performance indicator. It is assumed that the stochastic parameter, which characterizes the number of failures in time, is described by a certain distribution law (most often Poisson’s) with a continuous or discrete intensity function. The latter is deter- mined by the results of static analysis of operational data. The dis- advantages of this type of model are similar to those mentioned above.
Models [14–18] were created focusing on the description of the third performance indicator. The data for analysis in these models are:

the number of failures in the operation of the studied system for the censored period, which was caused by unknown factors;
the number of failures in the operation of the studied system during the censored period, which was caused by factors, the mechanisms of counteraction which were embedded in the studied system at the stage of its design.

Data analysis is carried out by combinatorics and maximum likelihood methods. Such models are more informative but still based on information, some of which were collected due to uncon- trolled experiments.
Models [19–23] were created focusing on the description of the fourth operational indicator based solely on the results of con- trolled experiments. Considering that the causes of failures are usually interrelated, models of this type are based on the mathe- matical apparatus of Markov chains. This allows us to take into account the multithreading in the operation of the studied system and the heterogeneity of the process of its recovery after a failure. Semi-Markov models more accurately describe the behaviour of real information systems because the process of recovery of the first ones after failure can be characterized not only by the expo- nential distribution function. The structural features of the studied system in this modelling approach can be taken into account in the graph of the control flow, which brings the Markov based model closer to the described process. This qualitatively distinguishes the Markov approach from, for example, a nonparametric neural network, in which the structural features of the studied system are ignored.
Considering the above, we will focus on the Markov approach to the description of the studied ecosystem’s operation process [24– 27]. Close analogues of the models of operation of info- communication systems based on discrete Markov chains are described in articles [21–23]. These models are based on elements of reliability theory and describe the studied info-communication system as a system with failures and recoveries. In the mentioned studies, the studied system’s operation process is formalized in the metrics of absolute qualitative indicators of the theory of reliabil- ity. At the same time, the economic aspect is completely ignored. However, the results presented by the authors of these studies have shown that Markov processes can be used to model the response of info-communication systems to input influences if the latter can be considered stochastic and independent. Based on these postulates, the use of Markov processes to model the operation of info-communication systems is permissible [28].
The object of research is the operation process of a centralized wireless information ecosystem focused on multimedia streaming. The aim of the study is the analytical formalization of this process



in the parametric space of qualitative parameters of reliability and economic efficiency.

Materials and methods

Statement of the research

We will study the ecosystem of the cluster of the centralized wireless network of multimedia streaming [29–31]. Let the width of the communication channel of the base transceiver station (BTS) be v Mbps. Two info-communication streams are sent to the BTS interface.
The first summarizes requests from a set of multiple end-users of multimedia content with a capacity of s. An arbitrary represen- tative of this set with exponentially distributed intensity b1 sends real-time multimedia transfer requests to the BTS interface. If such a request is made, BTS will spend b1 Mbps on the resource of the communication channel. This communication channel resource is reserved for the corresponding subscriber for a time equal to the average a—1, where a1 is the parameter of the exponential distribu- tion of the stochastic value of the average duration of the multime- dia transfer session. If at the time of receipt of the request for multimedia transfer, the free share of the resource of the commu- nication channel is less than b1, the incoming request is not accepted for service and is lost.
The second input stream summarizes requests from an infinite number of end-users of textual information. An arbitrary represen- tative of this set with intensity k2, distributed according to Pois- son’s law, sends to the BTS interface requests for text data transfer.

visions, we distinguish the state’s space X subspace S ∈ X, which includes states that satisfy the definite condition of self- limitation (1). We also define the state space B1, which includes states that characterize the situations of rejection of incoming requests for multimedia transfer due to lack of the required share of   free   resources   of   the   communication   channel:
B1 = {(i1; i2)}6i = b1i1 + b2i2 P v + 1 — b1. Considering that the
stochastic parameters a—1 and a—1 are distributed exponentially

duration of the text data transfer session. If at the time of receipt of the request for transfer of text data the free share of the resource of the communication channel is less than b2, then such a request is not accepted for service and is lost.
Let us summarize by tuple (i1; i2) the number of multimedia and
text data transfer sessions, respectively, which BTS supports when receiving its input request for text data transfer. Accordingly, at this moment, the share of the resource of the communication channel is equal to i = b1i1 + b2i2 what is used. The second stream is by definition, prone to BTS overload.

Based on this definition, we express such qualitative character- istics of the studied process as:
the percentage of lost requests for multimedia transfer pc;1;
the percentage of lost requests for text data transfer pc;2;
the average share of BTS communication channel resources involved in multimedia transfer servicesm1;
the average share of the BTS communication channel resource involved in the service of text data transfer m2. Relevant analyt- ical expressions are given below:

Let the parameters i1(t) and i2(t) characterize the number of supported BTS sessions of multimedia and text data transfer at the time t, respectively. The change in the values of these parame-
ters over time is described by a two-dimensional stochastic pro-
where c is the number of lost requests.
Next, we express the potential number of multimedia transfer sessions for the first stream of incoming requests from the number of subscribers equal to s:

The solution of system (9) satisfies the rationing condition:

Special attention should be paid to characteristic (8) because, by definition, it describes the benefits lost by the studied system.
To evaluate a specific information system in the metrics of char- acteristics (2)-(5), (7), (8) it is necessary based on data on the results of its operation for a censored time to calculate the proba-
bilities P(i1; i2). The latter is possible only in the presence of an
appropriate system of statistical equilibrium equations.
Changing the state of (i ; i ) the studied ecosystem is possible as
X P(i1; i2) = 1


When describing real processes of type r(t), the number of lin- ear equations in the system (9) can reach thousands. This circum- stance necessitates a more detailed consideration of the process of solving the system of statistical equilibrium equations (9).
Considering the potential dimension of the system of equations (9), it is not practical to apply classical methods for sequential exclusion of unknown or block transformations to solve it. Accord- ing to the authors, the iterative modification of the method of

We maintain the parameter P(k)(i1; i2),(i1; i2) ∈ S, which will store the value of the k-th approximation as a result of the imple- mentation of the corresponding iteration of the Gauss-Seidel algo- rithm. The k + 1-th approximation is obtained based on the k-th approximation as a result of a recursive procedure of type.

The occurrence of event 4 changes the current state of the ecosystem (i1; i2) to a state (i1; i2 — 1) with intensity P(i1; i2)a2i2 with a probability equal to one of the termination conditions for the active session of text data transfer is met.

fer. To maintain a session of the first or second type, a share of the communication channel resource equal to b1 = 5 or b2 = 1, respec- tively, is spent. At the same time, the subscription base of users who have privileges for the multimedia transfer includes s = 100 people.

a2(i) = 2; 5i, where i = 1; 400. The established parameters of the
model  were  developed  as  follows:  v = 103,  a1 = a2 = 1,
b1 = (s — a1)—1a1,k2 = a2, a1 ∈ [0; 20], a2 ∈ [0; 1000].
The calculated dependences d are presented in Fig. 2.
Emphasizing that the qualitative indicators (2) and (3) are stochastic and relative. To obtain a holistic view of the develop- ment of the studied process r(t), it is necessary to calculate the
dependencies {m1; m2} = f (q) under the same conditions of the
experiment under which the results presented in Fig. 2 were obtained. Absolute qualitative parameters m1 and m2 are calcu- lated by expressions (4) and (5), respectively. Note that at the ini- tial stage of this experiment, the resource of the communication channel is symmetrically divided between the traffic of multime-
dia transfer and text data transfer (for q = 0; 1 both curves comes
from one point of the y-axis).
The results of this experiment are presented in Fig. 3.
The experience of the actual operation of the studied ecosystem shows that as the ratio of b1/b2 increases, the share of lost requests for text data transfer increases, but at the same time the tendency
to displace multimedia transfer traffic with text data transfer traf- fic increases. Let us investigate whether the mathematical appara- tus presented in Section 3 reproduces the trends described. To do
this, calculate the dependences of pc;1 = f (q; b1 = {50; 25; 10; 5})
for s = 250. Other established parameters, b2 = 1, did not change relative to previous experiments.
The obtained results are presented in Fig. 4.
Again, based on the results of the operation of the real ecosys- tem, it can be argued that preventing the transfer of multimedia transfer traffic by text data transfer traffic is possible only by reserving a share of the communication channel resource for the stream of the first type.

characterizes the percentage of lost requests for the transfer of
multimedia or text data in an ecosystem with an active self- limiting function. The experiment was performed under conditions similar to those that allowed obtaining the results presented in Figs. 2 and 3. The only difference is b1 = 50, for which the value of h1 was determined: h1 = b1.
The results of the study are summarized in Fig. 5.
Considering that the process of operating a multimedia stream- ing ecosystem is commercial, an important aspect is to establish the fact that it is effective in using the resource of the communica- tion channel. It should be borne in mind that without activating the self-limiting function, the communication channel will eventu- ally be loaded by the stream of the second type, which is not a

the studied ecosystem focused on multimedia streaming in the parametric space of parameters (2)-(5), namely:
the percentage of lost requests for multimedia transfer pc;1;
the percentage of lost requests for text data transfer pc;2;
the average share of the resource of the BTS communication channel involved in the service of multimedia transfers m1;
the average share of the BTS communication channel involved in the service of text data transfers m2.

Fig. 2 shows that from the initial value of the ecosystem load q = 0; 1 and further for all values of this parameter, the tendency to displace multimedia transfer traffic with text data transfer traf-
fic is maintained and intensified.
The different nature of the functions pc;1 = f (q) pc;2 = f (q) is due to the consideration proposed in Section 3 of the fact that dif- ferent distribution laws describe the characteristic parameters of these flows. The example of the dependence pc;2 = f (q) shows that the process of the dominance of text data transfer traffic increases abruptly. While it is possible to increase the volume of text data

of losing the requests of the second type decreases. Under the con- ditions of the experiment, b1/b2 = 5 the BTS initiates five text data transfer sessions at the end of one multimedia transfer session. But with increasing q, the share of multimedia transfer sessions in the BTS communication channel decreases exponentially, so the ampli- tude of the oscillation of the dependence pc;2 = f (q) decreases.
The same tendencies, but in absolute units of values of param- eters m1 and m2 we can see in Fig. 4. The experiment begins when the BTS channel resource is split in half between the first and sec- ond type streams of incoming requests (one starting point for both
m1 = f (q) and m2 = f (q) dependencies). As the congestion value q
increases, the average share of the BTS channel resource used in the multimedia transfer service m1 increases more slowly with the value of the parameter m2. Further growth occurs by decreas-
ing the value q ≈ 0; 8 until the entire resource of the communica-
tion channel is flooded with text data traffic (q ≈ 1; 9 and so on).
We have already linked the nature of the oscillation of the dependence pc;2 = f (q) with the value of the dependence b1/b2. Considering that the purpose of the studied ecosystem is the trans-

fer of multimedia, it is impossible to ignore the influence of the value b1/b2 on the behaviour of the parameter pc;1 in conditions of increasing the value of the load indicatorq. This information is presented in Fig. 4. We can see that the dependencies pc;1 = f (q; b1 = 10) and pc;1 = f (q; b1 = 10) are devoid of oscilla-


priority for the studied ecosystem. At the same time, activating the self-limiting feature can potentially cause the communication channel to be underloaded due to the rejection of text data transfer requests.
So, let’s connect the concept of efficiency of use of the commu- nication channel resource by the studied ecosystem with the parameter c = v—1(m1 + m2). The experiment will be based on
the calculation of the dependencies {c; cu} = f (q), which cu is an
indicator of the efficiency of the use of the communication channel resource by an ecosystem with an activated self-limiting function. The experiment was performed under conditions similar to the previous one.
The obtained results are visualized in Fig. 6.

Discussion

Let’s start the analysis of the results of experiments from the description in Figs. 2 and 3. These figures show the behaviour of
tions, in contrast to other dependencies (for b1 = {50; 25}). It is also seen that b1 = {10; 5} the displacement of multimedia transfer traffic does not start immediately, but at q = {0; 2; 0; 3}. Moreover,
with decreasing value of b1/b2 this trend increases, which indicates favour of the adequacy of the proposed mathematical apparatus.
In general, presented in Figs. 2-4, results convincingly prove that the studied ecosystem cannot fulfil its purpose at a moderate and high load without introducing the self-limiting function. Fig. 5 shows that introducing the self-limiting function of the form (1) h1 = b1 gives an unambiguously positive effect. If the dependencies
pc;1; pc;2  = f (q) (self-limitation is deactivated) show the usual
displacement of multimedia transfer traffic by text data traffic, then with active self-limitation ( pu ; pu  = f (q)) the loss of
incoming requests does not depend on their type but is due to increasing the value of the load indicator q.
Finally, interpret the presented in Fig. 6 results are simple: the smaller the dynamics of growth of an arbitrary dependence of the form c = f (q), the more efficiently the resource of the communica- tion channel is used. This criterion shows that the introduction of



the self-limiting function of the form (1) h1 = b1 allows not only to ensure that the studied ecosystem fulfils its purpose at any load on the communication channel but also to do it almost twice as effi- ciently. However, the growing dynamics of the dependence
cu = f (q) indicate that the choice h1 = b1 is suboptimal. This circum-
stance allows us to consider promising to direct further research toward setting and solving the task of finding the optimal type and values of controlled variables of the self-restraint function h1 = b1.


Conclusion

The basis of the digital society is the ability to effectively com- municate with communities, people and things. It should be borne in mind that people are natural and comfortable communicating in video conferencing, while IoT devices mostly exchange text mes- sages. As the size of these user audiences in today’s cyberspace grows exponentially, communication tools and their information systems become bottlenecks in the path of progress. Thus, the study of the functioning of a centralized wireless information ecosystem (as a basic link of modern info-communication infras- tructure), focused on multimedia streaming, is relevant.
The highlights of the article are the Markov model of function- ing of the centralized wireless information ecosystem focused on multimedia streaming. The model describes the stochastic process of joint service by the BTS of independent streams of multimedia transfer and text data transfer. To assess the effectiveness of the fulfilment of its purpose by the studied ecosystem a metric of qual- ity parameters is proposed, in particular:

the percentage of lost requests for multimedia transfer;
the percentage of lost requests for text data transfer; - the aver- age share of the resource of the BTS communication channel involved in the service of multimedia transfers;
the average share of the BTS communication channel involved in the service of text data transfer;
the percentage of censored operating time of the studied sys- tem, when the incoming request for multimedia transfer was rejected due to lack of the required share of free resources of the communication channel;
the ratio of the number of lost multimedia transfer requests to the potential number of transfer sessions.

The first four parameters are indicators of the reliability of the studied system, and the last two qualitative parameters have a direct economic interpretation. For the studied ecosystem to be able to realize its purpose in conditions of moderate and high load, the model introduced a self-limiting function. This feature allows us to flexibly balance the process of servicing transfer sessions of both types, balancing the values of the first two quality indicators. The adequacy of the proposed mathematical apparatus is proved empirically.
Analysis of the real ecosystem with the help of the created mathematical apparatus has shown that the function of self- restraint is a means of controlling the efficiency of use of the resource of the communication channel. This circumstance allows us to consider promising to direct further research toward setting and solving the task of finding the optimal type and values of con- trolled variables of this function. We also note that the scientific and applied results presented in the article were tested in the 4G ecosystem. At the same time, the authors suggest that the theoret- ical results obtained can be adapted to describe the competing interaction of enhanced Mobile BroadBand (eMBB) and massive Machine-Type Communication (mMTC) services in the 5G ecosys- tem. The authors are going to confirm or refute this thesis in fur- ther studies.
