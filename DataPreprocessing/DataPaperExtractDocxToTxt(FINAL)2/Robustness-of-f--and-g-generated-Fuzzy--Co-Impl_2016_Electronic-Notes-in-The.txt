Abstract
This paper studies the robustness of intuitionistic fuzzy implications in fuzzy reasoning based on Atanassov’s intuitionistic fuzzy logic. Starting with an evaluation of the sensitivity in representable fuzzy negations, we apply the results in the Yager’s classes of fuzzy implications called the f - and g-generated fuzzy implications. The paper formally states that the robustness preserves the projection functions in such class and also discusses their corresponding dual operators.
Keywords: Robustness analysis, Intuitionistic fuzzy logic, Yager’s implications, f - and g-generated implications.


Introduction
Since Yager’s classes of fuzzy implications called the f - and g-generated implica- tions [24] have been used in common sense reasoning, there is a practical need for intuitionistic fuzzy versions of these operations, i.e., an operation If (x, y) that uses the membership degrees μA(u) = a and μB(u) = b of two intuitionistic fuzzy sets A and B to estimate the uncertainty degree of confidence in the statement

A →f B. These operations are also extensions of the corresponding crisp opera- tion: If (0, 1)=If (0, 0)=1, If (1, 0)=0 and If (1, 0) = 1.
The concepts of maximum and average perturbations of fuzzy sets [25], estimat- ing the maximum and average perturbation parameters for various methods of fuzzy reasoning is relevant for systems based on fuzzy logic (FL) and as a consequence for intuitionistic fuzzy logic (IFL).

Main related works
In [15], Li et al. study properties of some measures of robustness (or sensitivity) of fuzzy connectives and implication operators and discuss their relationships with perturbation properties of fuzzy sets. Many other works have discussed the robust- ness analysis also including the δ-sensitive approach, see e.g. [14], [15], [16], [17] and [18].
This paper extends the δ-sensitivity study of some intuitionistic fuzzy con- nectives (IFCs) according with results previously presented in [15], based on Atanassov’s Intuitionistic Fuzzy Logic (A-IFL), as presented in [1].
In [24], some properties of the Yager’s classes of fuzzy implications including the h-generated implications are discussed, describing their relationships amongst themselves and with the well established strong and residual implication classes [9]. Additionally, in [19], the Bandler-Kohout subproduct relational inference sys- tem with the fuzzy implication interpreted as the Yager’s classes of implications are reported, studying many of the desirable properties as interpolativity, conti- nuity, robustness and computational efficiency, expanding the choice of operations
available to practitioners.
A semantic behaviour of a fuzzy rule model is proposed in [13] as a pair of fuzzy implication and modus ponens generating function used for inference. Such methodology is applied to Yager’s models which are obtained from Yager implication function. By Yager’s implicative implication, it is shown to be midway between the usual residual and strong implications generated from the product t-norm. In fact, Yager’s implication belongs to a more general family of implications that can also be generated from the t-norms.
Such analysis can improve the study of the stability of systems based on intu- itionistic fuzzy rules. The notion of δ-sensitivity of fuzzy connectives in the fuzzy intuitionistic approach, which is characterized by the non-complementary relation- ship between the membership and non-membership functions, as proposed in [2], is considered in this work.

Main contribution of the paper
Following preliminary studies introduced in [21], this paper considers the robustness analysis defined on δ-sensitivity of the Atanassov intuitionistic fuzzy approach of the Yager’s implication classes, the f - and g-generated implications [24], focusing on their pointwise components obtained by the projections related to membership and non-membership functions.

Extending previous work in [20], [21] and [27], the paper provides an interpreta- tion of IFCs based on δ-sensitivity which is closely related to truth and non-truth in conditional fuzzy rules. Thus, not only the robustness of representable intuitionistic fuzzy negations are proposed but also the analyse of their perturbations based on δ-sensitive of the Yager’s implication classes and their dual construction, the f - and g-generated coimplications.
As the main result, the robustness of intuitionistic fuzzy f - and g-generated (co)implications can be expressed by the robustness of their arguments, by corre- sponding fuzzy f - and g-generated (co)implications. These results are summarized in commutative diagrams showing that the δ-sensitivity operator commutes with the NS-dual operator, by considering both approaches of FL and IFL.

Outline of the paper
The paper is organized as follows.
Firstly, the preliminaries describe the basic concepts of FCs and IFCs.
General results of robustness of FCs are stated in Sections 3 including the study of δ-sensitivity of fuzzy negations and fuzzy implications, mainly related to f - and g-generated implications.
In Section 4, we consider δ˜ = (δ1, δ2) ∈ U 2, in the δ-sensitivity of an intuitionistic

operator fI at point x˜
∈ U˜n in terms of its left-projection (lU˜n (x˜)) and right-

projection (rU˜n (x˜)), which are related to the δ-sensitive of the membership and
non-membership degrees of an element x ∈ χ associated with the IFS fI (U˜n). Thus,
the study of δ-sensitivity of intuitionistic fuzzy negations and intuitionistic fuzzy implications, mainly related to f - and g-generated implications are considered.
Final remarks are reported in the conclusion.

Preliminaries
By recalling some basic concepts of FL and IFL, we firstly report notions of FL as conceived by Zadeh [26] concerning negations and (co)implications [10]. Relevant papers studied different classes of fuzzy implications, see [5,11,12] and [24].
Let U = [0, 1] be the unit interval of real numbers. Recall that a function
N : U→U is a fuzzy negation if it satisfies, for all∈U the properties:
N1: N (0)=1 and N (1)=0;	N2: If x≥y then N (x)≤N (y).
A fuzzy negation satisfying the involutive property:
N3: N (N (x)) = x, ∀x ∈ U ;	is called a strong fuzzy negation (SFN), e.g. the standard negation NS(x)=1 − x.
When x = (x1, x2,..., xn) ∈ Un and N is a fuzzy negation, the following nota- tion is considered: N (x)= (N (x1),N (x2),...,N (xn)).
Let N be a negation. The N -dual function of f : Un → U is given by:
fN (x)= N (f (N (x))), ∀x ∈ Un.	(1)

An implicator operator I : U 2 → U extends the classical implication:
I0: I(1, 1)=I(0, 1)=I(0, 0)=1, I(1, 0)=0.
Definition 2.1	[10] In the sense of J. Fodor and M. Roubens, when x, y, z ∈
U 2, a fuzzy implication I	:	U 2	→	U  is an implicator also verifying:
I1: I(x, y) ≥ I(z, y) if x ≤ z (first place antitonicity); I2: I(x, y) ≤ I(x, z) if y ≤ z (second place isotonicity); I3: I(0, y) = 1 (dominance of falsity);
I4: I(x, 1) = 1 (boundary condition);
Analogously, a coimplicator J : U 2 → U verifies the conditions:
J 0: J (0, 0)=J (1, 0)=J (1, 1)=0, J (0, 1)=1.
It is immediate that a fuzzy coimplication is a coimplicator analogously defined as a fuzzy implication, replacing I3 and I4 in Definition 2.1 by J3 :J (x, 0) = 0 and J4 :J (1, y) = 0, respectively.
Among many classes of fuzzy (co)implication functions (see, e.g., [6] and [7]), the class of axiomatic representation of fuzzy implications, named A-implications, is described in [23] in terms of non-commutativity property related to t-norms. The A-implications are based on a subset of the axioms listed in [10]. In this paper, we focus on Yager’s implication.
In [24], Yager proposed two new classes of fuzzy implications, called f -generated implications and g-generated implications, which can not be fulfilled in the above presented classes.
By [24, Sect.3], let f : [0, 1] → [0, ∞] be an f -generator, which means, a strictly decreasing and continuous function such that f (0) = 1 and its pseudo-inverse f (−1) : [0, ∞] → [0, 1] is defined by: f (−1)(x) = f−1(x), if x ≤ f (0); and 0, otherwise. When 0·∞=0, an f -generated fuzzy implication If :U 2→U is given by
If (x, y)= f (−1) (x · f (y)) .
Moreover, let g : [0, 1] → [0, ∞] bea g-generator, which means, a strictly increasing and continuous function such that g(0) = 0 and its pseudo-inverse g(−1) : [0, ∞] → [0, 1] is defined by: g(−1)(x) = g−1(x), if x ≤ g(1); and 1, otherwise. When 1 = ∞
and ∞· 0= ∞, a g-generated fuzzy implication Ig :U 2→U is given by
I (x, y)= g(−1)  1 · g(y)  .
Proposition 2.2  [24] The binary function IY , (JY ):U 2→U given by
IYf (x, y)= 1, if x = y = 0; and IYf (x, y)= yx, otherwise.	(2)
JYf (x, y)= 0, if x = y = 1; and JYf (x, y)=1 − (1 − y)1−x, otherwise.   (3) is an f-generated fuzzy (co)implication called Yager(co)implication. Additionally, the function Ig, (Jg):U 2→U given by

1
IYg (x, y)= 1, if x = y = 0; and IYg (x, y)=1 − (1 − y) x , otherwise.	(4)
 1 
JYg (x, y)= 0, if x = y = 1; and JYg (x, y)= y 1−x , otherwise.	(5)
is an g-generated fuzzy (co)implication.
Example 2.3 [4, Examples 3 and 4] Eqs. (2) and Eq. (4) (Eqs. (3) and Eq. (5)) define fuzzy (co)implications, according to Definition 2.1.
Corollary 2.4 Both functions (IYg , JYg ) and (IYf , JYf ) deﬁne pairs of NS-dual fuzzy (co)implications.
Proof. Straightforward.	2
Intuitionistic fuzzy connectives
This section briefly study intuitionistic fuzzy connectives. For further references, see [1,2,3,8] and [9].
According to [1], an intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) AI in a non-empty, universe χ, is expressed as AI = {(x, μA(x), νA(x)) : x ∈ χ, μA(x)+ νA(x)) ≤ 1}. Thus, an intuitionistic fuzzy truth value of an element x in an IFS AI is related to the ordered pair (μA(x), νA(x)). Moreover, an IFS AI generalizes a FS A = {(x, μA(x)) : x ∈ χ}, since νA(x), which means that the non-membership degree of an element x, is less than or equal to the complement of its membership degree μA(x), and therefore νA(x) is not necessarily equal to its complement 1 − μA(x).
Let U˜ = {(x1, x2) ∈ U 2|x1 ≤ NS(x2)} be the set of all intuitionistic fuzzy
values and lU˜ , rU˜ : U˜ → U be the projection functions on U˜, which are given by
lU˜ (x˜)= lU˜ (x1, x2)= x1 and rU˜ (x˜)= rU˜ (x1, x2)= x2, respectively.
Thus, for all x˜ = (x˜1,..., x˜n) ∈ U˜n, such that x˜i = (xi1, xi2) and xi1 ≤ NS(xi2) when 1 ≤ i ≤ n, considering lU˜n , rU˜n : U˜n → Un as the projections given by:
lU˜n (x˜)= (lU˜ (x˜1), lU˜ (x˜2),..., lU˜ (x˜n)) = (x11, x21,... xn1);	(6)
rU˜n (x˜)= (rU˜ (x˜1), rU˜ (x˜2),... rU˜ (x˜n)) = (x12, x22,... xn2).	(7)
By [2], for x˜, y˜ ∈ U˜, the order relation ≤U˜ is given as
x˜ ≤U˜ y˜ ⇔ x1 ≤ y1 and x2 ≥ y2, suchthat˜0= (0, 1) ≤U˜ x˜ and ˜1= (1, 0) ≥U˜ x˜(.8) Moreover, the folowing expression is known:
x˜ ≤U˜ y˜ ⇔ x1 ≤ y1 and x2 ≤ y2,	(9)

An intuitionistic fuzzy negation (IFN shortly) NI : U˜
x˜, y˜∈ U˜, the following properties:
NI 1 : NI (˜0) = NI (0, 1) = ˜1 and NI (˜1) = NI (1, 0) = ˜0;
NI 2: If x˜ ≥ y˜ then NI (x˜) ≤ NI (y˜).
→ U˜
satisfies, for all

Additionally, NI is a strong intuitionistic fuzzy negation (SIFN) verifying the condition:
NI 3: NI (NI (x˜)) = x˜, ∀x˜ ∈ U˜.

Consider NI as IFN in U˜ and f˜ : U˜n → U˜. For all x˜ = (x˜1,..., x˜n) ∈ U˜n, the

NI -dual intuitionistic function of f˜, denoted by f˜NI
: U˜n → U˜, is given by:

f˜NI (x˜)= NI (f˜(NI (x˜1),..., NI (x˜n))).	(10)
When N˜I is a SIFN, f˜ is a self-dual intuitionistic function. Additionally, by [3,

Theorem 1] [8], a SIFN NI : U˜ → U˜
such that:
is a SIFN iff there exists a SFN N : U → U

NI (x˜)= (N (NS(x2)), NS(N (x1))),	(11)
Additionally, if N = NS, Eq. 11 can be reduced to NI (x˜)= (x2, x1).
According with [7, Definition 3], an Atanassov intuitionistic fuzzy implication II : U 2 → U is an intuitionistic fuzzy implicator such that, the analogous conditions from II 1 to II 4 in Definition 2.1 are verified with the additional property:
II 5: If x˜ = (x1, x2) such that x1 + x2=1 it holds that NS(x1 + x2)=0 
Thus, recovering Definition 2.1 of a fuzzy implication in the sense of J. Fodor and M. Roubens’ work [10], an intuitionistic fuzzy implication also reproduces fuzzy (co)implications if, for all x˜ = (x1, x2), y˜ = (y1, y2) ∈ U we have x1 = NS(x2) and y1 = NS(y2).
According to [2], another way of defining an operator II is to consider boundary conditions in II 0 and properties II 1 and II 2. In [7], Bustince et al. constructed fuzzy implications for intuitionistic fuzzy logic, in the sense of [7, Definition 3], based on aggregation operators and SFNs.
Considering the above results, the functions II (JI ) : U˜2 → U˜ are repre-
sentable fuzzy (co)implications based on SFN NS : U → U if there exist fuzzy (co)implications Ia, Ib(Ja, Jb) : U 2 → U such that, for all x˜, y˜ ∈ U˜, the following holds:
II (x˜, y˜)= (Ia(NS(x2), y1), NS(Ib(x1, NS(y2))));	(12)
JI (x˜, y˜)= (Ja(NS(x2), y1), NS(Jb(x1, NS(y2)))).	(13)
Proposition 2.5 Let If , Ig, (Jf , Jg) : U 2 → U be f- (g-)generated fuzzy (co)implications deﬁned in Proposition 2.2. The functions IYf I, IYg I (JYf I, JYg I ) : U˜2 → U˜ are representable fuzzy (co)implications expressed as:
IYf I (x˜, y˜)=  y	, 1 − (1 − y2)  ; JY (x˜, y˜)= 1 − (1 − y1) , y1), y	 (.14)
1−x2	x1	x2	1−x1
		
 1 	 1	 1	 1  

Proof. Eq.(14) follows from Eq.(12) by taking Ia = Ib = IYf and Ja = Jb = JYf . And, Eq.(15) follows from Eq.(13) by taking Ia = Ib = IYg and Ja = Jb = JYg .	2

Pointwise sensitivity of fuzzy connectives
Based on [15] and [20], the study of a δ-sensitivity of n−order function f at point x
on the domain U is considered, in the context of robustness of fuzzy logic, mainly

related to the class of (S, N )-implications.
Definition 3.1 [15, Definition 1] Let f : Un → U be an n−order function, δ ∈ U and x = (x1, x2,... xn), y = (y1, y2,... yn) ∈ Un. The δ-sensitivity of f at point x, denoted by Δf (x, δ), is given by
Δf (x, δ)= sup{|f (x) − f (y)| : y ∈ Un and   (x, y) ≤ δ}	(16) wherever	(x, y) = max{|xi − yi| : i = 1,..., n}. Additionally, the maximum δ
sensitivity of f , denoted as Δf (δ), is defined as follows:


Δf (δ)= 
x∈Un
Δf (x, δ).	(17)

Proposition 3.2 [20, Theorem 1] If N = NS and fN is the N-dual function of f
then the sensitivity of fN at point x is given by
ΔfN (x, δ)= Δf (N (x), δ).	(18)
δ sensitivity of f− and g−generated fuzzy (co)implications
Now, we investigate the δ-sensitivity in FCs, in terms of Definition 3.1 based on results previously presented in [15]. In order to provide an easier notation, when f : U 2 → U and x = (x, y) ∈ U 2, consider the following notations:
f[x|≡ f ((x − δ) ∨ 0, (y + δ) ∧ 1); f[x♩≡ f ((x + δ) ∧ 1, (y − δ) ∨ 0).
Proposition 3.3 [15, Theorem 1] Consider f : U 2 →U, δ ∈ U and x = (x, y) ∈ U 2. If f veriﬁes both properties, ﬁrst place antitonicity (I1) and second place isotonicity (I2), then:
Δf (x, δ)= (f (x) − f[x♩) ∨ (f[x|− f (x)).	(19)
Proposition 3.4 The δ-sensitivity of the functions IYf , JYf , IYg , JYg deﬁned in Proposition 2.2 by Eqs. (2)-(5) is given by Eq. (19).
Proof. Straightforward Proposition 3.3 and Corollary 2.3.	2
Maximum sensitivity of f− and g−generated fuzzy (co)implications
In the following, we consider the maximum δ sensitivity of the f -and g-generated fuzzy implications IYf and IYg , showing that they coincide with their NS-dual con-

structions, (JYf
) and (JYf
), by considering the endpoints of unitary interval in U 2.

Remark 3.5 Based on Eqs. (19) and (18), also including results in Proposition18, we obtain the following:
ΔIYf ((0, 0), δ)= (1 − 0) ∨ (1 − 1) = 1 = ΔJYf ((1, 1), δ) ; 
ΔIYf ((0, 1), δ)= (1 − (1 − δ)δ) ∨ (1 − 1) = 1 − (1 − δ)δ = ΔJYf ((1, 0), δ) ; 
ΔIYf ((1, 1), δ)= (1 − (1 − δ)) ∨ (1 − 1) = δ = ΔJY ((0, 0), δ);
ΔIYf ((1, 0), δ)= (0 − 0) ∨ (δ1 − δ − 0) = δ(1−δ) = ΔJYf ((0, 1), δ).

Remark 3.6 Based on Eqs. (19) and (18), also including results in Proposition18, we obtain the following:

1
ΔIYg ((0, 0), δ)= 1 δ ∨ (−1 − δ)
=1= ΔJYg ((1, 1), δ) ; 

1	1
ΔIYg ((0, 1), δ)= δ δ ∨ 0= δ δ = ΔJYg ((1, 0), δ) ; 
ΔIYg ((1, 1), δ)= δ ∨ 0= δ = ΔJYg ((0, 0), δ);
1−δ	 1 

ΔIYg
((1, 0), δ)=0 ∨ 1 − (1 − δ)
=1 − (1 − δ) 1−δ = ΔJY
((0, 1), δ).

Proposition 3.7 The maximum sensitivity of the f- and g-generated fuzzy (co)implications IYf , JYf , IYg , JYg , as deﬁned in Proposition 2.2 by Eqs. (2)-(5), is given as follows:
ΔIYf (δ)=1= ΔIYg (δ) and ΔJYg (δ)=1= ΔJYf ((δ);	(20)
ΔIYg (δ)=1= ΔIYg (δ) and ΔJYg (δ)=1= ΔJYg (δ).	(21)
Proof. Straightforward from Remarks 3.5 and 3.6.	2
Based on Proposition 3.7, the maximum δ sensitivity of the f - and g-generated fuzzy (co)implications IYf and IYg is related to the endpoints (0, 0) and (1, 1), re- spectively. Such results are closely related to their corresponding definition.
Moreover, based on Remarks 3.5 and 3.6, one can observe that IYg is more robust than IYf at point (0, 1), since ΔIYf ((0, 1), δ) > ΔIYg ((0, 1), δ). In the converse, IYf is more robust than IYg at point (1, 0), since ΔIYf ((1, 0), δ) < ΔIYg ((1, 0), δ).
Robustness of intuitionistic fuzzy connectives
In this section, we consider YI ∈ {Yf I, YgI} which means, YI denotes either f− or
g−generated intuitionistic fuzzy implication.
In order to provide a formal definition of robustness which can be applied to
n-order intuitionistic fuzzy f - and g-generated implication operators, consider def-

inition of the δ-sensitivity of an n−order fuzzy negation fI :
x˜ = (x˜1, x˜2,..., x˜n) ∈ U˜n.
U˜n → U˜
at point

Thus, when δ˜ = (δ1, δ2) ∈ U 2, the δ-sensitivity of an intuitionistic operator

fI at point x˜
∈ U˜n is defined in terms of its left-projection (lU˜n (x˜)) and right-

projection (rU˜n (x˜)), which are related to the δ-sensitive of the membership and
non-membership degrees of an element x ∈ χ associated with the IFS fI (U˜n).
Definition 4.1 For y˜ ∈ U˜n, the δ-sensitivity of fI at point x˜ is defined by ΔfI (x˜, δ˜)=sup{|fI (x˜)−fI (y˜)| : (lU˜n (x˜), lU˜n (y˜))≤δ1 and  (rU˜n (x˜), rU˜n (y˜))≤δ2},
when (x, y) = max{|xi1 − yi1| : i = 1,..., n}, (x, y) = min{|xi2 − yi2| : i = 1,..., n}.
Preserving the robustness of representable negations
The next proposition states that the pointwise sensitivity is preserved by the pro- jection functions applied to an intuitionistic fuzzy negation (IFN) which is repre- sentable in the same sense of [3] and [8].

Proposition 4.2 [27] Let NI : U˜n → U˜
be a SIFN as deﬁned by Eq.(11). When

δ˜ = (δ1, δ2) ∈ U 2 and x˜ ∈ U˜n, the δ-sensitivity of NI at point x˜, is given by
ΔNI (x˜, δ˜)= (ΔN◦NS (rU˜n (x˜), δ2), ΔNS◦N (lU˜n (x˜), δ1)).	(22)

Corollary 4.3	[27] When
δ˜ = (δ1, δ2) ∈ U 2, NI = NSI and x˜
∈ U˜n, the δ-

sensitivity of NI at point x˜, can also be expressed as
lU˜ (ΔNI (x˜, δ˜))=Δl ˜ ◦NI (rU˜n (x˜), rU˜ (δ˜));	(23)
rU˜ (ΔNI (x˜, δ˜))=Δr ˜ ◦NI (lU˜n (x˜), lU˜ (δ˜))).	(24)
In particular, we have that ΔNSI (x˜, δ˜)= (δ2, δ1).
The diagram below summarizes the main results of Proposition 4.2 and Corol- lary 4.3: the robustness of representable IFNs can be expressed by robustness of their arguments:

Robustness of intuitionistic fuzzy functions and NSI-dual constructions
From the δ-sensitivity of fI : U˜n → U˜ at point x˜ one can obtain the δ-sensitivity of corresponding dual construction, as described in the following proposition:
Proposition 4.4 Let fI : U˜n → U˜ be a representable fuzzy (co)implication deﬁned
by Eq.(12) (Eq.(13)) and ΔfI (x˜, δ) be the δ-sensitivity of fI at point x˜. When
δ˜ = (δ1, δ2) ∈ U 2 , NI = NSI and fIN  is the NI-dual function of fI, the δ-
sensitivity of fINI at point x˜ is given by
Δ(fI )NSI (x˜, δ˜)= ΔfI (NSI (x˜), δ˜) .	(25)
Proof. For all x˜, y˜ ∈ U˜n, it holds that:
Δ(fI )NS (x˜, δ˜)= (ΔfN (NS(x12), x21), δ1), ΔNS◦fN (x11, NS(x22)), δ2)) by Eqs. (6),(7)
= (Δf ((x12, NS(x21)), δ1), ΔNS◦f ((NS(x11), x22), δ2)) by Eq.(18)
= ΔfI (lU˜ (NI (x˜), δ˜), (ΔfI (rU˜ (NI (x˜), δ˜))  by Eqs.(23),(24)
= (ΔfI (NSI (x˜), NSI (δ))) by Eqs.(6),(7)
Therefore Eq.(25) holds.	2

δ-sensitivity of f− and g−generated intuitionistic fuzzy (co)implications
In this section, we study the robustness of the Atanassov intuitionistic fuzzy ap- proach related to the f− and g−generated intuitionistic fuzzy (co)implications IYf I
2	2	˜	˜
(JYg I ) at point x˜ ∈ U˜ . For that, when fI : U˜	→ U˜, δ = (δ1, δ2) ∈ U and
x˜ = (x˜, y˜) ∈ U˜2, we follow the notations below:
fI[x˜|≡ fI ((x˜ − δ˜) ∨ ˜0, (y˜ + δ˜) ∧ ˜1); f[x˜♩≡ fI ((x˜ + δ˜) ∧ ˜1, (y˜ − δ˜) ∨ ˜0).


Proposition 4.5 Consider fI :
U˜2 → U˜,
δ˜ = (δ1, δ2) ∈ U˜
and x˜
∈ U˜2. If fI

veriﬁes both properties, ﬁrst place antitonicity and second place isotonicity, then:

ΔfI (x˜, δ˜)= (fI (x˜) − f[x˜♩) ∨ (f[x˜|− f (x˜))	(26)
Proof. Straightforward Proposition 3.3.	2
Proposition 4.6 Let IYf I (JYf I ), IYg I (JYg I ) : U˜	→ U˜ be a representable f- and
2
g-generated (co)implications as given by Eqs.(14) and (15). If δ˜ = (δ1, δ2) ∈ U 2

and x˜ = (x1, x2) ∈ U˜2 the δ-sensitivity of both IY
deﬁned by Eq.(26).
(JYf I
), IYg I
(JYg I
) at point x˜ is

Proof. Straightforward, since they verify both Properties I1I and I2I , by Propo- sition2.5.	2
Proposition 4.7 Let IYf I (JYf I ), IYg I (JYg I ) : U˜	→ U˜ be a representable f- and

enerated (co)implications as given by Eqs.(14) and (15). If δ˜ = (δ1, δ2) ∈ U 2

and x˜ = (x1, x2) ∈ U˜2 the δ-sensitivity of both IY
expressed as follows:
and IYg I
at point x˜ can be

ΔI	(x˜, δ˜)= ΔI
f I
(lU˜ (NS(x1), x2), δ1), ΔIYf
(rU˜ (NS(x1), x2)), δ2) ;	(27)

ΔIYg
(x˜, δ˜)= ΔIYg (lU˜ (NS(x1), x2), δ1), ΔIYg (rU˜ (NS(x1), x2)), δ2) .	(28)

Analogously, the δ-sensitivity of JYf I and JYg I at point x˜ is deﬁned by

ΔJ	(x˜, δ˜)= ΔJ
f I
(lU˜ (x1, NS(x2)), δ1), ΔJYf
(rU˜ (x1, NS(x2))), δ2) ;	(29)

ΔJYg
(x˜, δ˜)= ΔJYg (lU˜ (x1, NS(x2)), δ1), ΔJYg (rU˜ (x1, NS(x2))), δ2) .	(30)

Proof. Let IYf I be an intuitionistic fuzzy Yager’s implication which is representable by the Yager fuzzy implication IYf and the standard negation NS, as defined by Eq.( 12), then:

ΔIY (x˜, δ˜)= 
=sup{|IY (x˜)−IY (y˜)| : y˜ ∈ U˜2,  (l ˜2 (x˜),l ˜2 (y˜)) ≤ δ1 and  (r ˜2 (x˜),r ˜2 (y˜)) ≤ δ2}
=sup{|IY ((x11, x12), (x21, x22))−IY ((y11, y12), (y21, y22))| : y˜ ∈ U˜2 and
  (lU˜2 (x˜), lU˜2 (y˜)) ≤ δ1 and  (rU˜2 (x˜), rU˜2 (y˜)) ≤ δ2}
=sup{|(IY (NS(x12), x21), NS(IY (x11, NS(x22))−(IY (NS(y12), y21), NS(IY (y11, NS(y22))| :
y˜ ∈ U˜2 and  (l ˜n (x˜),l ˜2 (y˜)) ≤ δ1 and  (r ˜2 (x˜),r ˜2 (y˜)) ≤ δ2} by Eq.( 12)
=sup{|l ˜2 (IY (x1, x2))−l ˜(IY (y1, y2))| : y˜ ∈ U˜2 and  (l ˜2 (x˜),l ˜2 (y˜)) ≤ δ1},
sup{|r ˜2 (IY (x1, x2))−r ˜(IY (y1, y2))| : y˜ ∈ U˜2 and  (r ˜2 (x˜),l ˜2 (y˜)) ≤ δ2})
=(ΔIY (lU˜ (NS(x1), x2), δ1), ΔIY (rU˜ (NS(x1), x2), δ2)) by Eq.( 16).
Therefore, for all x˜, y˜ ∈ U˜2, by Eqs. (6) and (7), it follows that lU˜2 (ΔI (x˜, δ˜)) =
ΔIY (lU˜ (NS(x1), x2), δ1); and rU˜2 (ΔIY (x˜, δ)) = ΔIY (rU˜ (NS(x1), x2)), δ2). In analo-
gous manner, Eq. (28) and corresponding dual constructions can be proved.	2
The diagram below summarizes the main results of Propositions 4.6 and 4.7 related to an f -generated intuitionistic fuzzy (co)implications: the robustness of intuitionistic fuzzy f -generated (co)implication can be expressed by the robustness of their arguments, by corresponding fuzzy f -generated (co)implications:

The following theorem extends the results in [15]:
Theorem 4.8 Consider δ˜ ∈ U˜ e x˜ ∈ U˜2. It follows that:
ΔIY I (x˜, δ˜)	=	ΔJY I (NS(x˜), δ˜) when IY	(JY ) is an f-generated fuzzy (co)implication;
ΔIY I (x˜, δ˜)	=	ΔJY I (NS(x˜), δ˜) when IY	(JY ) is an g-generated fuzzy (co)implication.
Proof. Straightforward Proposition 4.4.	2
Table4.3 summarizes the δ-sensitivity of the Atanassov intuitionistic approach of the Yager’s (co)implication, in the endpoints of U˜.
In the following, we discuss the examples in the first line. Other cases in Table4.3 can be analogously extended:

Sensitivity analysis for the intuitionistic approach of an fuzzy g-generated (co)implication


Proposition 4.9 The maximum sensitivity of the intuitionistic fuzzy f- and g-generated (co)implications IYf I, JYf I, I, JYg , as deﬁned in Proposition 4.7 by Eqs. (27)-(30), is given as follows:
ΔIYf I (δ˜)= (1, 1) = ΔIYg I (δ˜) and ΔJYg I (δ˜)= (1, 1) = ΔJYf I (δ˜);	(31) ΔIYg I (δ˜)= (1, 1) = ΔIYg I (δ˜) and ΔJYg I (δ˜)= (1, 1) = ΔJYg I (δ˜).	(32)
Proof. Straightforward from Proposition 4.4 and the results reported in Tables 4.3 and 4.3.	2

Corollary 4.10 Consider f- and g-generated (co)implications IYf I, JYf I, I, JYg as deﬁned in Proposition 4.7 by Eqs. (27)-(30). Then the following holds:
IYg I is at least as robust as IYf I at point x˜ ∈ {(˜0, ˜0), (˜1, ˜1)};
JYg I is at least as robust as JYf I at point x˜ ∈ {(˜0, ˜0), (˜1, ˜1)};
JYf I is more robust than IYf I at point (˜0, ˜1); and
IYf I is more robust than JYf I at point (˜1, ˜0).
Proof. Straightforward.	2

Conclusion
Estimating the sensitivity to small changes is related to reducing sensitivity in the corresponding pointwise components of such fuzzy connectives. Thus, in this paper, by taking the class of strong fuzzy negation (standard negation), the paper formally states that the sensitivity of an n-order intuitionistic fuzzy connective at a point x ∈ Un preserves its projections related to the sensitivity of its fuzzy approach at the same point, when representable fuzzy negations are considered.
The main contribution is concerned with the study of robustness on Atanassov intuitionistic fuzzy approach related to the f - and g-generated (co)implication. Some additional studies, considering δ-sensitivity of A-implications and their cor- responding dual construction should be carried out.
Ongoing work, focussing on the sensitivity of fuzzy inference dependent on in- tuitionistic fuzzy rules based on intuitionistic fuzzy connectives, including the ex- tension of the robustness studies of R-(co)implications, will also be investigated.
To sum up, future research aims to contribute with fundamental theoretical results for applications dealing with main results in the robustness analysis con- sidering their principal operators, e.g. erosion, dilation, closing, opening operators used in the mathematical morphology.
