The aim of the present study intended mainly to investigate the interrelationships between the six studied taxa namely Abutilon theophrasti, Lavatera cretica, Hibiscus trionum, Hibiscus sabdariffa, Malva parviflora and Sida alba collected from ten different accessions in Egypt belonging to family Malvaceae. Biochemical studies include protein profile using SDS-PAGE technique and three isozymes (esterase, peroxidase and acid phosphatase). The electro- phoretic analysis revealed the presence of eighteen bands of molecular weight ranging from 11.3 to 115.3 KD. The highest number of bands 15 was observed in H. sabdariffa (Hs1) collected from Menia el-Kamh district and the two accessions of M. parviflora where as the lowest number 11 bands were recorded in H. trionum collected from Talkha district. Four loci of peroxidase isozyme distinguished, three loci of acid phosphatase isozyme and two loci of esterase isozyme. In regarding to random amplified polymorphic DNA technique (RAPD), ten primers were used to differentiate between these accessions. Primer OPA-4 gave the highest percentage of polymorphism (100%), while primer OP-B6 produced the lowest percentage (50%).

Introduction

Malvaceae or the mallow family is the family of flowering plants containing over 200 genera with close to 2300 species.
The largest genera Hibiscus (300 species), Streculia (250 species), Dombeya (225 species), Pavonia (200 species) and Sida (200 species). The principle economic use of Malvaceae plants is as a source of natural fibers, the family providing perhaps the

worlds three most important fiber crops plants of the family are also used for food, beverages, timber, in traditional med- icine and in horticulture [1].
Many researches have been published on the ecology, taxonomy, genetic, cytology, chemotaxonomy, physiology, seed germination and economic uses of family Malvaceae such as [2] in ecology; in taxonomy [3], in chemotaxonomy [4] and in genetic researches [5] studied the pollen.
Aerial parts of many species belong to family Malvaceae have Betaines, Glycine betaines were obtained in high yield (0.5e4.6% dry weight). Also, trigonelline was recorded, but the yield was low (0.005e0.07% dry weight) [4].
Isozymes have been widely used as a molecular markers for the identification the genetic relationships among genera, species and varieties. The phylogenetic relationships in many genera have been studied by isozymes electrophoresis [6] and [7].
Seed protein electrophoresis has been successfully used in define species relationships in various groups of plants [8].
The technology of the molecular biology has been devel-
Native PAGE for isozymes

Isozymes variations identified using native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Three isozymes (esterase, peroxidase and acid phosphatase) studied. These isozymes were separated on polyacrylamide gel according to [13].

DNA extraction

Genomic DNA of the ten accessions of six taxa was extracted from fresh young leaves according to [14].

Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD-DNA)

Ten primers were used to generate RAPD markers according to

Therefore, the present study was designed to clarify the genetic relationships among six taxa belong to family Malva- ceae collected from ten different accessions from Egypt. This work is very important to document in gene banks for sus- tainable conservation of plant genetic resources.

Materials and methods

Accessions selection

Ten accessions of the six studied taxa Table 1 subjected to analysis using available characterization methods. Viable seeds of the studied taxa were collected from 50 mature in- dividuals. Identification and nomenclature of studied species were according to [10] and [11].

Protein analysis

Electrophoresis analysis of seed proteins followed the method for discontinuous SDS-PAGE technique of [12].
All gels were photographed and analyzed using Bio-Rad video Documentation system Model Gel Doc 2000. The presence or absence of each band was treated as a binary character in a data matrix (coded 1 and 0 respectively). Data analyses were performed using SYSTAT version 7.0 program [16].

Discussion

Biochemical and molecular techniques are provided ap- proaches for evaluating genetic diversity in plants. These methods are favored because they are independent of the developmental stage of the plant [17]. Biochemical evidences such as seed storage protein electrophoresis and isozyme polymorphisms are convenient evidences for assessing ge- netic relationships [18] and [19].
The variation in SDS-PAGE of seed protein profiles have successfully been used to differentiate between species [20] and provide a valid source of taxonomic evidence for addressing the relationships at the different taxonomic levels [21].
The electro-phenogram of the examined ten accessions of the six studied taxa revealed a total number of eighteen bands. The highest number of bands 15 was observed in H. sabdariffa collected from Menia El-Kamh, El-Sharkyia and the two accessions of M. parviflora. The molecular weight of these bands ranging from 11.3 to 115.3 KDa, where as the lowest number 11 bands were recorded in H. trionum collected from Talkha- El-Dakahlyia Governorate the molecular weight of these eleven bands ranging from 11.3 KDa to 115.3 KDa.
Isozymes polymorphisms are used effectively to assess genetic relationships among individuals, populations and closely related species [22] and [23]. The applications of iso- zymes polymorphism are still important for population ge- netic studies and in addressing infra-specific relationships [24].
There are three isozymes (esterase, peroxidase and acid phosphatase) were used to differentiate among the ten ac- cessions of the six studied taxa belonging to family Malvaceae. It was found that acid phosphatase and peroxidase isozymes are more effectively in differentiation among these accessions of the studied taxa, while esterase isozyme was not able to differentiate.
Proteins and isozymes electrophoretic markers have been used in many crops to some extent. The major limitation of these two procedures is the lack of enough polymorphism among closely related cultivars [25]. For this reason, DNA based genetic markers have been integrated into several plant systems and are playing a very important role in molecular genetics and plant breeding [25] and [26].
Randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) technique has been used in many different applications involving the detection of DNA sequence polymorphisms [27] to identify varieties [28] and to assess the genetic diversity [29] and [30]. In this study ten primers used to differentiate among the ten accessions of the six studied taxa belonging to family Malva- ceae. The primers gave reproducible results but the best primer used to differentiate was primer OPA-4 and gave the highest percentage of polymorphism. Primers OPA-7 and OPB- 1 gave the same percentages of polymorphism, primers OPB-

17 and OPA-15 also gave the same percentages of polymorphism.
Cluster analysis was conducted to generate a dendrogram Fig. 2 clustering possible relationships among the ten studied accessions of six species of family Malvaceae in Egypt based on compiled all matrix data. Investigated accessions were divided into two groups at 0.315, the first group includes Hs2 collected from Talkha district, and the second group is divided into two subgroups at a distance of 0.266. The first subgroup includes Hs1 and At, while the second subgroup includes Lc, Ht1, Ht2, Mp1, Mp2, Sa1 and Sa2. In the second subgroup Sa1 and Sa2 were separated from the rest at a distance 0.218.
