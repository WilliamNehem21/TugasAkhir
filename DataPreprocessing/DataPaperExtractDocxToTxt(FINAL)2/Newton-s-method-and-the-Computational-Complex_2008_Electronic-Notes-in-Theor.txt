Abstract
Several different uses of Newton’s method in connection with the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra are pointed out. Theoretical subdivision schemes have been combined with the numerical Newton iteration to yield fast root-approximation methods together with a constructive proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra. The existence of the inverse near a simple zero may be used globally to convert topological methods like path-following via Newton’s method to numerical schemes with probabilistic convergence. Finally, fast factoring methods which yield root-approximations are constructed using some algebraic Newton iteration for initial factor approximations.
Keywords: Subdivision schemes, global methods, factorization approach, constructive proofs.


Introduction
Weyl used Cauchy’s integral theorem to show that a subdivision scheme combined with a root-proximity test is sufficient to obtain approximations of prescribed ac- curacy to all roots of a polynomial after a bounded number of steps. The method may be considerably accelerated locally by Newton’s iteration if a zero or cluster is sufficiently isolated. This yields method of low arithmetic and boolean complexity, and is an interesting example of a theoretical proof generating a practical method considered in Section 2.
Cauchy gave a version of Argand’s conitinuity-based proof in his ’Cours d’analyses’ notes of 1821. This proof proceeds via a descent in modulus. Given a non-zero, a point with function value of smaller modulus might be determined in polynomial

time as became clear in a constructivist proof by H.Kneser in 1940. Hirsch/Smale exhibited a never-failing method to approximate roots via Newton’s method with a self-adapting Newton-correction but this method suffers from high complexity. Smale posed in 1981 the problem to approximate roots of polynomial equations using only (non-modified) Newton steps for approximation, and in Shub/Smale suggested to approximate solutions via continuity of solutions along a coefficient homotopy. It is well-known that Newton’s method fails if a zero of the derivative is produced, and it slows down near multiple roots (i.e. near the set of ill-posed problems). Thus, the convergence of Newton’s method (which implies succesful root-approximation) might be measured in probabilistic terms considering the mea- sure of succesful starting points or the distance of homotopies from the manifold of ill-posed problems. There exist no methods which come close to the theoretical lower complexity estimates, and it is not known whether purely iterative higher- dimensional methods exist. We review several results in Section 3.
Very fast methods in terms of arithmetic and bit-complexity are based on the fac- torization approach for a polynomial P . Building on tight root-moduli bounds a zero-free annulus separating k and deg P k roots is determined. The factor F corresponding to k roots of P is approximated, and subsequently refined. The refinement via an algebraic Newton iteration is the workhorse of Scho¨nhage’s fun- damental study as well as the more recent work of Neff/Reif which exhibits a low complexity exceeding O(deg P log5 deg P ) just by a logarithmic term depending on the coefficient size and factor approximation quality. The connection to Newton’s method is outlined in Section 4.

Cauchy
Cauchy gave two proofs of the fundamental theorem of algebra. One after Argand’s proof sketch of 1806, the other using the integral theorem (somewhat similar to Gauss’ 3rd proof of 1816 [16]).

Cauchy’s integral theorem
Theorem 2.1 (FTA)
Every algebraic equation over C with exact degree n, i.e.
anzn + an−1zn−1 + ... + a1z + a0 =0 with an /= a0nd ai ∈ C ∀i
has n roots in C.
Starting from a root modulus bound like
1 + max ai / an
0≤i<n

(which was obtained by Cauchy in [5]), we obtain a circle of radius R which contains all roots in its interior.
Cauchy’s integral theorem and its consequences imply that the increase in argument of f (z) on the circle |z| = R, i.e.

f'(z)/f (z)dz
|z|=R
is proportional to n, which is the number of roots. This proof seemingly does not exhibit any method to approximate roots. But Cauchy’s argument allows to count roots inside a curve by evaluation of the integral of f '/f .
This was used in a (intuitionistic) proof by Weyl to exhibit a subdivision scheme which yields all roots with a specified accuracy after a finite number of steps. The scheme runs as follows: The circle of radius R containing all roots is inscribed in a square of side length 2R. This first square is suspect, i.e. it contains roots. In each level (of increasing precision) the suspect squares are subdivided into four (whence later researchers named this procedure quadtree construction [20]). Using a numerical evaluation of the integral f '/f , the connected sets of squares containing roots are marked as suspect.
Approaches to make this Cauchy-Weyl scheme computationally attractive substi- tuted the numerical evaluation of the integral by other tests indicating proximity of roots. Typically, estimates for the root modulus are applied after shifting the origin to the center of a suspect square. A test which estimates the modulus of polynomial roots with but a constant overestimation factor is Turan’s proximity test (we state here a sharp version after [3]):

0= an · sn+k + ... + a1 · sk+1 + a0 · sk,	k = 1, 2,...,n. 


Using Graeffe’s root-squaring process, we might obtain small annular rings for the
root moduli. Graeffe’s root-squaring proceeds from a monic polynomial ti(y) with roots z1,..., zn to a polynomial ti+1(y) := ti(√y)ti(−√y) with roots z2, z2,... at
the cost of a polynomial multiplication (which may be effected via FFT techniques).

Thus, we may obtain after N squarings the close estimate

The number of suspect squares remains bounded by 4n h in iteration step h even if proximity tests are computed with relative eror of 50% [19]. Thus, Pan [19] estimates the cost of the Cauchy-Weyl-Turan approach as order of
O(n2h log n log log n)
arithmetic operations to approximate all n zeros within diam/2h, where diam de- notes the diameter of the set of all the zeros (viz. [19], p.193).
To speed up the linear process of subdivision, Renegar, and independently, Pan suggested in 1987 to use Newton’s iteration.

Newton iteration
The Newton iteration proceeds from xi to xi+1 := xi	f (xi)/f'(xi) (if f'(xi)	= 0) to approximate solutions of f (x) = 0. Cauchy gave one of the first known general convergence criteria.
Theorem 2.2 (Cauchy; 1829) Given a real polynomial f and a real value x0. Put
h := −  f (x0) . Let M denote the maximum of f ''(x) over K =< x + h, h >, and

f'(x0)
assume that
0

C := |f (x0)|M ≤ 1 .	(1)

|f '(x0)|2	2
Then there exists precisely one zero of f in K.
If moreover 	|f (x0)|M	 ≤ 1 ,	(2)
|f '(x0)|· minx∈K|f '(x)|	2
the Newton iteration converges to the zero.
The lower bound (2) for the derivative modulus was made obsolete by the anal- ysis of Ostrowski who showed (cf., e.g., [17]) that (1) is a sufficient condition for convergence to an isolated zero,
Ostrowski’s condition is fulfilled near a root and quantitative convergence conditions are possible, see, e.g. [32].

Theorem 2.3 Let P (x)  Z[x] be square-free with deg P = m and M = 1 +  P ∞. If a root X∗ of P (X)=0 and the starting point of the Newton iteration, X0, are at a distance of at most
δ0 = [m3m+9(1 + M )6m]−1
the Newton iteration converges.
We will see below that the condition of the theorem implies that the root approxi- mation lies close to a root, and isolated from all other roots. Generally, it may be
shown that the Newton iteration converges to a root X∗ from starting points inside a disc D containing X∗, if D has an isolation ratio of at least 2√2+√13n [22,18,20].
Estimates of the derivative f ' on a domain (as used in Ostrowski’s analysis) were
replaced by (scaled) estimates of the higher derivatives f (k) at a single, common point in Smale’s theory of point estimates. Rheinboldt [23] showed that Ostrowski’s convergence condition implies a point estimate condition.
The Newton iteration converges if the updates decay exponentially.
Definition 2.4 Given a polynomial f of degree n and a starting point x0. Suppose the sequence of Newton iterates xi+1 = xi f (xi)/f'(xi) is well-defined for all k  0, and that it holds true that
	 1 2k−1 
xk+1 − xk  ≤	2	x1 − x0 .
Then we say that x0 is an approximate zero.
From an approximate zero point x0 the Newton iteration converges exponentially to an actual zero. Approximate zeros may be characterized from point estimates.
Definition 2.5 Given a complex polynomial f of degree n define


α(f, x0)
:=  f (x0)	sup
f'(x )
f (k)(x0) 1/(k−1)
|k!f'(x  ) |	.

0	k=2,...,n	0
Theorem 2.6 Given a polynomial f of degree n, and a starting point x0. If
1
α(f, x0) < 8 ,
then x0 is an approximate zero. Thus, the Newton iteration xi+1 = xi	f (xi)/f'(xi)
converges starting from x0.
To speed up the Cauchy-Weyl-Turan root approximation scheme, the linear refine- ment of a root approximation via subdivision of a suspect square is replaced by the Newton iteration whenever it converges at least quadratically. Using either isola- tion radii or Smale’s point estimates it may be shown [20] that only O(nlog(hn))

squares in Weyl’s quadtree have to be treated. This allows to approximate all n zeros within diam/2h, where diam denotes the diameter of the set of all the zeros, with
O((n2 log n) log(hn))	arithmetic operations.

Root separation
For a square-free polynomial we might also want to give isolating squares for com- plex roots or isolating intervals for real roots. For integer polynomials, Cauchy established a lower bound for the minimum root separation [5], and employed it in a first real root isolation method via brute force partitioning.
Definition 2.7 The minimum root separation of an integer polynomial P (x) given as
n	n
P (x) := Σ aixi ∈ Z[x]= an ·  (x − ζi), where an /=, 0 

i=0
is defined as sep(P ) :=	min
ζi/=ζj
P (ζi)=P (ζj )=0
i=1
n i=0
|ai|.

Cauchy used the polynomial’s discriminant,
Definition 2.8

discr(P ) := a2n−2 
(ζi − ζj)2


(esp. the fact that discr(P )	Z) in his memoir of 1829 (to be found in [5]) to derive the following estimate for the root separation.
Proposition 2.9 Given P (x) ∈ Z[x] of degree n it holds true that
sep(P ) >	√discr(P )	≥	1	.

|an|n−1
(2 · s(P ))
n(n—1) −1

|an|n−1
(2 · s(P ))
n(n—1) −1


Estimates of the computational cost of any subdivision or exclusion/inclusion scheme, like Cauchy’s, Weyl’s, Lehmer’s [12], Gargantini/Henrici [6], will depend on good estimates of this root separation. Define the measure M (P ) of a polynomial as
n
M (P ) := |an|	max{1, |ζi|}.
i=1

From Jensen’s inequality, we find	M (P )	s(P ) =: s (a first proof appears in [11]). Using the continous measure M (P ) Mahler derived the best published bound
[13] from a study of the discriminant.

Theorem 2.10 (Mahler; 1964) Let P (x)= Σn aixi be a square-free integer poly-

nomial of size s and degree n. Then
sep(P ) >  √3 ·	discr(P )
nn/2+1 · M (P )n−1

√3 ·	discr(P ) . nn/2+1 · sn−1


Considering Pˆ(x) := P (x)/gcd(P (x),P'(x)) we find that a similar result holds true for arbitrary polynomials P .
Corollary 2.11 Let P (x)= Σn aixi be an integer polynomial of size s and degree

n. Then

√3	√3

sep(P ) > nn/2+1 · M (P )n−1 ≥ nn/2+1 · sn−1 .

Argand
Argand used the existence of k th roots in C together with the facts that every polynomial is a continous function on C, and that continous functions on C attain a minimum over compact sets to give a proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra in 1806. The proof was reworked by Argand in 1813, and became widely known when it was published by Cauchy in 1820.
Argand’s main point is that to every c  C with f (c)  = 0 there existcs'  C with f (c') < f (c) . The continous function f  attains its minimum over a compact set containing all roots, and it would lead to a contradiction if this minimum were unequal to zero.
The existence of a descent in modulus may be shown as follows:
Let h(z) := f (c + z)/f (c) = 1 + bkzk + bk+1zk+1 + ... + bnzn, and with g(z) := bk+1z + ... + bnzn−k write h(z)= 1 + bkzk + zkg(z). Denote the k−th root of −1/bk as d, then it holds true for all real t, 0 < t ≤ 1, that
|h(d · t)|≤ |1 − tk| + |dktkg(dt)| =1 − tk + tk|dkg(dt)|.

As g is a continous function with g(0) = 0 there exists (we may choose) a point δ in [0, 1] such that |dkg(dt)| < 1/2 for all 0 < t < δ. For all such t we obtain |h(d · t)|≤ 

1 − tk + 1/2tk < 1. Thus, there exists u ∈ C with |h(u)| = |f (c + u)/f (c)| < 1 whenever f (c) /= 0.
This nice analytic proof depends heavily on the notion of continuity, but it may also be turned into an effective computational scheme as H. Kneser showed in 1940. H. Kneser [9] gave his proof in the framework of intuitionism via an auxillary result which enabled a descent in modulus as


1
|f (xk)| < (1 − 2 )k
· max{1, |f (x0)|}



Thus, we may trace the image f such that in every considered point the modulus decreases. We may consider two different demands at this point:
To follow the curve of decreasing modulus numerically.

Gauss’ statement in his fourth and last proof of the FTA that any method capable of proving the existence of all roots simultaneously is of higher distinction:
‘Indessen gewinnt ohne Zweifel jede Beweisfu¨hrung eine ho¨here Vollendung, wenn nachgewiesen wird, dass sie geeignet ist, das Vorhandensein der s¨ammtlichen Factoren unmittelbar anschaulich zu machen.’


Global Newton methods after Hirsch, Smale and Shub
Another constructive version of Argand’s proof (similar to Kneser’s [9]) was given by Hirsch and Smale in ([7], see Section 6, p.303 ff.). In the same paper, they showed that for a modified Newton method

xi+1 = xi − hi · f (xi)/f'(xi).

there exist open subsets W such that the ’incessantly’ modified Newton method converges to a point xˆ with f (xˆ) < ϵ from every starting point inside W . The modification proceeds by halving the Newton-step length whenever the derivative vanishes or the modulus exceeds ϵ. Thus, a modulus descent is forced in every step but the running time is not polynomially bounded in terms of degree and modulus bound.
To avoid modifications of Newton’s method Shub/Smale [27] considered to choose starting points at random. Choosing a point at random might yield a sequence of Newton iterates converging to some zero, or might lead to a breakdown of the method at a zero of the derivative.

Newton steps at large
Suppose we use a Lesbesgue measure on the continous set Pn(1) of polynomials of degree no larger than n and with coefficients not exceeding 1 in modulus. Renegar [21], and later Smale [28] gave probability estimates for succesful Newton iteration.

Theorem 3.1 A number of Newton steps sufficient to ﬁnd an approximate zero of
ƒ (x) with probability σ is
100(n + 2)7/(1 − σ).

Restarted generalized Newton method
Re-starting is often used in numerical schemes. It works rather well with higher order generalizations of Newton’s method. In the words of S.Smale [29]: ’Choose a starting point at random [.. .]. Then apply some variation of Newton’s method iteratively for a while. If that does not work, pick another starting point at random and repeat. [.. .] At this time Mike Shub and I [26] have a result which shows that for a polynomial of one complex variable, this method works in fact relatively quickly; six random choices are sufficient on the average.’ With ƒ−1 the branch of the inverse of ƒ which takes ƒ (z) into z, given as an analytic function in a neighbourhood of ƒ (z) (provided ƒ '(z) /= 0), define
Ek,h,ƒ = Tk(ƒ−1((1 − h)ƒ (z))),

where Tk denotes the power series expansion truncated at degree k.  With h := 1/512 and k = k(ϵ) := max(log log ϵ , log n) define Eє( ) := Ek,h,ƒ ( ). The following algorithm was proposed in [26]:

Algorithm (N − E)є Let ƒ ∈ Pn(1) and N = 512(n + |log ϵ|).
Choose z0 ∈ C, |z0| = 3 at random and set for j = 1, 2,... zi = Eє(zi−1). Termi- nate if at some stage |ƒ (zj)| < ϵ.
If j = N , return to the first step.
Theorem 3.2 For each ƒ and ϵ algorithm (N −E)є terminates with probability one and produces a z satisfying |ƒ (z)| < ϵ. The average number of cycles is less than or equal to 6. Hence, the average number of iterations is less than 6K(n + |log ϵ|).

Negative analysis
A radical approach to root approximation is to fix some arbitrary coefficient ho- motopy Pt, connecting a chosen P0(z) = an  (z  ξi) and the target polynomial P =: P1 and to to do one step along the homotopy curve in coefficient space after one root iteration step. Such path following procedure has been called purely iter-

ative by Smale, it may be described as a rational endomorphism on the polynomial coefficients, the iteration data, and the path homotopy.
In the framework of purely iterative schemes, McMullen studied [14] the rational schemes like Newton’s regarding their global convergence properties. It transpired that non-convergence of rational iterations from a starting point is not a rare occa- sion.
Theorem 3.3 There exists no one-dimensional, rational polynomial root approxi- mation iteration which is globally convergent, i.e. which converges for every starting point outside a ﬁxed set of measure zero.
This result enhances Gauss’ remark (quoted above) on the importance of simul- taneous root approximation, and strengthens the case for path-following methods. Following a curve taking Newton-steps, or trying to approximate roots via Weier- straß’ path-following is sensitive to the distance to ill-posedness.

Homotopy Path following
Shub and Smale showed that we may trace zeros along a homotopy in principle using Newton steps [27]. To state this result we need some definitions of theirs.
Consider a homotopy from ƒ0 to ƒ1, i.e. a continous family of holomorphic functions ƒt : C → C, 0 ≤ t ≤ 1. An associated path is a continous map from [0, 1] × C → C,t → ζt where
ƒt(ζt)=0 
Dƒt(ζt) is an isomorphism.
Given a subdivision T = t0 = 0, t1,..., tk = 1 , ti < ti+1, T = k employ Newton’s method for every ti as
xi = Nƒt (xi−1).
It is said that Newton’s method follows the homotopy path {ƒt, ζt} if all xi are well- defined, all iterates xi are appromiate zeros of their appropriate ƒti , quantified as α(ƒt , xi) < 1 (13 − 3 17), and even more specifically the xi are supposed to be
approximate zeros to the actual zeros ζti . For a homotopy path F = ƒt, ζt  define L = L(F ) to be the length in the metric dP of the curve ƒt. Define the condition number of the homotopy path as
μ = μ(F ) = max μ(ƒt, ζt) = max max{1;  ƒt  Dƒ (ζt)−1√n(|ζ|2 + 1)n−1}.

Theorem 3.4 (Shub/Smale) Let F = {ƒt, ζt} be a homotopy path. Let
Ln3/2  2
k ≥ 0.11 μ .

Then k Newton steps are sufficient to follow the path ζt, 0 ≤ t ≤ 1.
This is not a constructive result (see [31] for detailed remarks), it merely states that there exists a partitioning of [0, 1] of some associated path which allows the Newton iteration to trace from ζ0 to ζ1 producing approximate zeros all throughout.

Weierstraft
In the 1859 session of the Preußische Akademie der Wissenschaften Weierstrass presented a proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra. Its publication was post- poned, as Weierstraß saw the dependency on continuity as a serious short-coming of the proof. In 1891, the proof was revised and published. It depends on a simul- taneous Newton iteration for the first n symmetric functions of the n polynomial roots. The iteration
z(n+1) = z(n) − P (z(n))/(an   (z(n) − z(n)))	(3)

was given explicitly with local convergence criterion in Weierstrass work; it has been re-discovered in the 20th century by Durand, Dochev, Kerner and others.
Weierstrass’ convergence criterion depends on the root-separation together with the quality of the approximation to the roots (i.e. on ’unattainable data’). We state here an improved criterion of the same type [25].
Theorem 3.5 (Dochev; 1962) Let P be a square-free polynomial of degree n with roots ζi. The Weierstraft-Dochev-Durand-Kerner iteration (3) converges with start- ing values z(0) =: zi if
n—√1 2 − 1
|zi − ζi| ≤ 2 n—√1 2 − 1 sep(P )	(4)

Following the paradigm of Smale’s point estimates we derive convergence conditions using attainable data from the iteration process (see, e.g., [1]).
Theorem 3.6 Let P be a square-free polynomial of degree n with leading coefficient an. The Weierstraft-Dochev-Durand-Kerner iteration (3) converges with starting values z(0) =: zi if

(5)


If the simultaneous iteration is used along a coefficient homotopy, a criterion like (5) would have to be evaluated in each move along the homotopy path. The allowable step-size along a homotopy from P0 = xn − a0 to P1 = P can be estimated via

matching bounds (see (6) below) for the perturbed polynomials. Replacing the minimum root-separation by its best known lower bound due to Mahler we obtain, all in all, an exponential estimate for the number of Newton steps (see, e.g. the analysis in [30]).
Theorem 3.7 Given a polynomial P with leading coefficient 1 which has pairwise distinct roots. Suppose that all polynomials of the homotopy
H(t, x) := t · p(x)+ (1 − t) · (xn − c),c /=, 0t ∈ [0, 1]
have parwise distinct roots. Denote the minimum over the minimum root separation of all polynomials Htˆ(x) := H(tˆ, x) by V . The length of the homotopy curve is denoted by L. To approximate all roots of P with precision ϵ,
L	1
CW V · n + log log ϵ Weierstraft iteration steps
along the homotopy are sufficient, where CW is a constant independent of n.
Explicit determination of V could be done via minimum root-separation estimates (after appropriate re-scaling each intermediate polynomial to integer coefficients). An arithmetic complexity estimate for path-following in this fashion would contain at least a term O(sn). It is probably instructive to compare this to the (non- constructive) minimum number of steps estimated by Shub/Smale.

Factoring a polynomial
As the FTA predicts n roots for a polynomial P (x)= xn + Σn−1 aixi =  (x − ζi)
of degree n we may try to produce n linear factors of P .
If the product of n factors Lj = (x  λj) approximates P in terms of a coefficient vector norm , P L1 L2 ... LN 1 < ϵ, we might use perturbation estimates to obtain root approximation estimates.
We make here a simplified statement of a perturbation result published in [2] but already contained in the unpublished report [24] of Sch¨onhage’s.
Lemma 4.1  Given two polynomials ƒ (x)= xn + Σn−1 aixi,g(x)= xn + Σn−1 bixi

with roots ζv and λv, respectively. A bound for both sets of roots is
γ :=2 · max{|ak|1/(n−k); |bk|1/(n−k)}.
Then the roots may be enumerated such that

To state more estimates relating to factorization we introduce the norm
n	n
 u(x)  := Σ|ui| for u(x)= Σ uixi.


The effect of recursive splitting in terms of the coefficient norm may be estimated using the following results.
Lemma 4.2 Let P (x) − ƒ1(x)ƒ2(x) ... ƒk(x )   ≤  k ·  ϵ  P (x)  /n,    ƒ1 −

ƒ (x)g(x)	≤ ϵ1 ƒ1(x)   and ϵ1 ≤ ϵ p(x) / n
ƒ (x)g(x)ƒ2(x) ... ƒk(x)  ≤ (k + 1)ϵ  p(x)  /n .
k i=1

Lemma 4.3 For a polynomial factorization of a polynomial P (x) of positive degree
n, say P (x)=  k	ƒi(x), the following coefficient norm inequalities hold true.


k
 P (x)  ≤ 
j =1
 ƒj(x)  ≤ 2n−1  P (x)  .


Thus, if P (x)  ƒ1(x)ƒ2(x) is split subsequently a norm-bound linear in ϵ and p(x)  may be maintained if the refined splitting is controlled by ϵ1 = ϵ/(n2n).
To obtain an initial splitting a zero-free annulus A is determined such that A sepa- rates k inner zeros in Din from n  k lying in the unlimited component of C  A. If the smallest root has modulus less than 0.5 and the largest root modulus exceeds 2, then by appropriate re-scaling and shifting/scaling a zero-free annulus around z = 1 may be found. Otherwise, either p∗(x) := xnp(1/x) or p(x) have all roots in z   2. Shifting to the center of gravity of zeros together with appropriate re-scaling and approximate root-modulus determination leads to a polynomial with largest root inside 0.98 < w < 1, and hence a diameter of the root set u1, u2,..., un larger than 0.98. This allows to choose geometrically a new center v such that
|v − u1|/|v − un| > 4/3, and shifting and rescaling yield the zero-free annulus A.
The factor F of P = F  G corresponding to the k zeros in Din is approximated by F∗. If the approximation quality is such that  F (x)  F∗(x) 	2−C·h·n for a fixed constant C, then G∗ is obtained via high-precision division of ƒ by F∗. An approximation F∗ may be obtained via the power sums sm,k =  zm of the k zeros lying inside Din. Instead of the Newton identities Cauchy’s integral theorem may be used for the approximation of the sm,k. Denoting by Γ a circle lying concentric inside A we have

 1 
m,k	2πi
xmp'(x)
dx.
Γ	p x

Using quadrature formulas in Q equally spaced points on Γ the numerical integration may be obtained via three FFTs on Q points.

Proposition 4.4 Suppose the inner boundary of A is a circle of radius r, and the outer boundary a circle of radius R with (R r)/r  cˆ/ndˆ with positive constants cˆ, dˆ. To obtain a splitting F∗G∗ of P with
 P (x) − F∗(x)G∗(x)   ≤ 2−C·nh  P (x) 
order of (h + n)n2 Boolean operations are sufficient.
To improve the initial factorization F∗G∗ of P a correction is determined. The correction to the initial factorization is a pair of polynomials ƒ, g of degree k − 1 and n − k − 1, respectively, chosen such that
P − FG	= ƒG + gF or equivalently

P − FG  = ƒ
+ g (deg ƒ < deg F, deg g < deg G)

FG	F	G
If Fnew = F + ƒ, Gnew = G + g then
FnewGnew − P = (F + ƒ )(G + g) − P = (FG − P )+ ƒG + gF + ƒg = ƒg 
so that
 FnewGnew − P  ≤ ƒ  g  .
The relations determining ƒ and g allow a norm estimate. Determination of terms ƒ, g could in principle be done by Euclid’s algorithm (incurring high bit-complexity). We sketch Sch¨onhage’s [24] technique in the following.

we might consider the hk as an approximate encoding of the inverse Jacobian Jα(p1,..., pk)−1 of α. Defining ƒj by ƒj  (hj p) mod pj updates may be de- fined as pˆj := pj + ƒj.
Updating the factors implies updating of the Jacobian. This is approximated as follows. Suppose

d :=1 −	hj

pi

is the initial defect of the set (h1,..., hk). Replacing hj by hˆj := hj (1 + d) mod pj
implies a quadratic relation between the new and the old defect.

To improve a factorization F · G ∼ P corrections ƒ, g are sought with


P − FG = ƒG + gF	or	P − FG  =  ƒ
+  g .	(7)

Sch¨onhage’s approach to approximate such partial fraction decompostion is as fol- lows. Suppose with a D of small norm we have
HG + QF =1 − D,	HG ∼ 1 − D	mod F
then Hˆ := H(1 + D) ∼ 1 − D2	mod F.
If Hˆ is restricted to be a polynomial of degree k − 1 it is uniquely determined.
Polynomials ƒ and g of degree not exceeding k	1 and n	k	1 respectively may be uniquely determined from
ƒ ∼ Hˆ P ∼ Hˆ (P − FG)	mod F
(P − FG) − ƒG = gF + R	with	deg R ≤ k − 1.

With a zero-free annulus (after transformations) around E := {z : |z| = 1} a lower bound for μ := minz∈E|P (z)| may be established. The polynomial is then normalized such that P = 1. If
F (x)= zk + φzk−1 + ... + φk,	G(x)= an(zn−k + .. .)
 FG − P  ≤ μ/8
then  FG 	1+ μ/8  9/8 P  and  F  < 2k,  F  < 9 2n−k. Schoenhage’s analysis shows that if D  μ2/(k222n), where μ = minz∈E P (z) a this iteration has exponential convergence.
The norms of ƒ and g are bounded using the relation P  FG = ƒG + gF , and the estimates on the zero-free annulus. Scho¨nhage’s analysis in [24] yields a complexity estimate in terms of the bit complexity (we state a reformulation after Neff and Reif below as Proposition 4.5). It was noted in [24] that the algorithm might suffer from non-balanced factors, e.g. the splitting into factors of degree n − 1 and 1, respectively. Such non-balancing might incur n − 1 splittings in total.
The basic splitting technique from [24] was supplemented in [15] by a balanced splitting of ƒ into ƒ1 ƒ2 ƒ3 such that either maxi=1,2,3 deg ƒi n/2 or if deg ƒk > n/2 then ƒk = ƒ4ƒ5ƒ6 with maxi=4,5,6 deg ƒi n/2. This allows to apply the algorithm recursively to polynomials of degree n/2.
Neff/Reif [15] considered the space n of monic polynomials zn + n−1 cizi with non-trivial coefficients bounded as ci < 2m, where m is minimal. The output precision is measured in terms of μ such that
|zi − wi|≤ 2−μ.

(This has no relation with the previous use of μ. The cluster isolation is measured in terms of δ-isolation: A disk D = D(z0, R) is called δ-isolated for a polynomial ƒ if there are no roots in the annulus
TD = D(z0; (1 + δ)R) \ D(z0; (1 + δ)−1 · R).
Using appropriate transformations of the matching bounds (6) and factor estimates in Lemmas 4.2, 4.3 Sch¨onhage’s method to construct and refine an initial splitting is the method supporting the following result.
Proposition 4.5 Suppose we are given a δ-isolated (δ   0.4) disk D contain- ing k roots (1   k  < n) of the polynomial ƒ	n. Then there exists an
O(n log2 n log(m + μ)) arithmetic algorithm for computing a factorization of ƒ into approximate factors ƒ˜1, ƒ˜2 corresponding to roots inside and outside D, respectively, such that the distance of ƒ˜i to ƒi (ƒ = ƒ1 · ƒ2) is at most
|ƒi − ƒ˜i| < 2(2n+nm)−(μ+2n+n max{n;m}+log log n)
If the δ-isolation is not sufficiently strong the following chain of ideas is used: Graeffe’s root squaring allows to obtain an isolation ratio of 4/10 after at most
k = log δ  1 squarings. Under the assumption that m  n, and if after i  1 squarings the moduli of ƒi lie inside [2−m/2, 2m/2] but outside after the i-th squaring a 4/10-isolated disk exists. Thus, the coefficients of all squared polynomials are bounded by 2m. From the factors of ƒk the factors of ƒ reconstructed using a partial GCD computation. The partial GCD is computed via structured determinants. Neff and Reif obtain the following.
Theorem 4.6 Suppose we are given a δ-isolated (δ > 0) disk D containing k roots (1  k < n) of the polynomial ƒ    n. Then there exists an O(n log2 n log(m + μ) log 1/δ) arithmetic algorithm for computing a factorization of ƒ into approximate
factors ƒ˜1, ƒ˜2 corresponding to roots inside and outside D, respectively, such that the
distance of ƒ˜i to ƒi (ƒ = ƒ1 · ƒ2) is at most
|ƒi − ƒ˜i| < 2(2n+nm)−(μ+2n+n max{n;m}+log log n)

Turan’s proximity test is used to obtain high-precision inclusions [Li, Ui] of the root moduli ri = ζi , where the roots are numbered sucht that r1 < r2 <   The in-
clusion quality determines different root regions according to which the polynomial is split. If the relative separation (Li+1 Ui)/Li+1 is sufficiently large, i.e. greater than 1/(168n2) while Ui/Li  1+ 1/(168n2), and n/4  i  3n/4 , we may use the partial GCD based splitting producing factors of degree no less than n/4. If the relative separation of root moduli is not sufficient, a new center is determined after consideration of several root regions. Comparing different annuli and circles con- taing the roots a new balanced splitting point is determined. Neff/Reif’s techniques allow recursive balanced splitting, and yield the following result.
