Abstract
We discuss effective integrability and effectivization of Fubini’s Theorem for a Fine-computable func-
tion F (x, y) on the upper-right open unit square. The core objective is Fine-computability of f (x) = 
[0,1) F (x, y)dy as a function on [0, 1).
Keywords: Two-dimensional Fine-computable function, effective integrability, Fubini’s Theorem, integral operator


Introduction
Notions of Fine-continuity and of Fine-computabilities on [0, 1) are defined with respect to the Fine topology (cf. Section 2, [2,3,6]). We have defined effective integrability for Fine-computable functions on [0, 1) ([6,8]). In this article, we in- vestigate the notions of Fine-computabilities and effective integrability of functions on the upper-right open unit square [0, 1)2.
In classical analysis, the integral operator with a kernel F (x, y), which maps a function g(x) on X to (Tg)(x) = X g(y)F (x, y)dy, is a central subject. Measura- bility and integrability of Tg are fundamental properties to be proved and Fubini’s Theorem is a fundamental tool to deal with investigations of such an operator.

Theorem 1.1 (Fubini’s Theorem) Let F (x, y) ≥ 0 be a measurable and integrable function on the upper-right open unit square [0, 1)2. Then the following hold.
For almost all x, F (x, ) is measurable and integrable.
∫[0,1) F (x, y)dy and ∫[0,1) F (x, y)dx are measurable.
∫∫[0,1)2 F (x, y)dxdy = ∫[0,1) ∫[0,1) F (x, y)dy dx = ∫[0,1) ∫[0,1) F (x, y)dx dy.
In this article, we discuss an effectivization of Fubini’s Theorem for uniformly Fine-computable functions on [0, 1)2 (Definition 3.3) and make an introductory con- sideration on Fine-computable functions (Definition 4.1). We also make some obser- vations on the transformation T . In effectivization, Fine-computability and effective integrability correspond to classical measurability and integrability respectively.
From the standpoint of computable analysis, it is expected that
f (x) = ∫[0,1) F (x, y)dy is defined everywhere on [0, 1) and f (x) is Fine-computable
for a Fine-computable function F (x, y) on [0, 1)2. To secure the former, we assume that F (x, y) is integrable with respect to y for all x ∈ [0, 1).
Since Fine-computable functions are continuous at all dyadically irrational points with respect to the Euclidean topology, they are measurable, and Fubini’s Theorem holds classically for integrable Fine-computable functions. Therefore, effectivization of Fubini’s Theorem boils down to the proof of Fine-computability of f (x). Hence the proof of this property is the main objective of this paper.
Roughly speaking, continuity of Tg is deduced from that of F (x, y). Hence, by modifying the proof of Fine-computability of f (x), we can easily prove Fine- computability of Tg under some suitable conditions on integrability.
Our main assertions are that Fine-computability of f (x) holds for a “uniformly Fine-computable” function F (x, y) and for a “bounded Fine-computable” function F (x, y), and that we need some additional conditions on general Fine-computable functions.
We make introductory speculations with some examples concerning Fine-com- putability of f (x).
Example 1.2 (Suggested by Yagishita) Let us define F (x, y) =  1  e−(  x  )2 . Then
1−y
F (x, y) is positive and continuous on R×[0, 1). It is easy to prove that the restriction
of F (x, y) to [0, 1) × [0, 1) is Fine-computable.

It holds that ∫ 1	(
)	= ∫ 1 	
−(  x  )2
= ∫ 1	2	√.

Hence ∫ 1 dy ∫ 1 F (x, y)dx < ∞.

On the other hand, F (0, y) =  1  is not integrable, that is, f (0) = ∫

[0,1)
F (0, y)dy

is not defined.
Example 1.2 shows that Fine-computability and integrability of F (x, y) do not assure that f (x) is a total function.
Example 1.3  Let α(k) be a recursive injection whose range is not recursive. Then
ϕ(y) = 2k2−α(k) if 1 − 2−(k−1) ≤ y < 1 − 2−k,k = 1, 2,... 
is Fine-computable and integrable but not effectively integrable (Brattka, [1]).

Define F (x, y) = ϕ(y)(1 − x)ϕ(y)−1 and f (x) = ∫

[0,1)
F (x, y)dy.

Then, F (x, y) is Fine-computable and not bounded. It holds that ∫[0,1) F (x, y)dx =
1, ∫∫[0,1)2 F (x, y)dxdy = 1 and f (x) is total.

On the other hand, f (0) = ∫

[0,1)
F (0, y)dy = Σ∞
2−α(k) is not a computable

number, and hence sequential computability for f (x) does not hold.
Example 1.3 shows that Fine-computability of F (x, y) and computability of
∫∫[0,1)2 F (x, y)dxdy do not imply Fine-computability of f (x) even if it is total.
In Section 2, we review Fine-computability and effective integrability for a func- tion on [0, 1).
In Section 3, we define the two-dimensional Fine-space and notions of Fine- computability and prove that f (x) is uniformly Fine-computable if F (x, y) is uni- formly Fine-computable (Theorem 3.6).
In Section 4, we prove that f (x) is Fine-computable for a bounded Fine-computable F (x, y) (Theorem 4.6). We give also a sufficient condition for Fine-computability of f (x), where F (x, y) is Fine-computable but not necessarily bounded. This is an effectivization of a well known classical result.
Consult [2] as to Fine-continuous functions.

Preliminaries
We summarize Fine-computability properties on [0, 1) and effective integrability of such functions. (See [6,7,8].) We assume basic knowledge of computability on the Euclidean space (cf. [9]). We use the notations N = {0, 1,.. .} and N+ = {1, 2,.. .}. A left-closed right-open interval with dyadic end points is called a dyadic interval.
We call I(n, k) = [k2−n, (k + 1)2−n) a fundamental dyadic interval (of level n)
and J(x, n), the unique fundamental dyadic interval I(n, k) which contains x, the
fundamental dyadic neighborhood of x (of level n).
Lemma 2.1  ([6]) (1) The following three properties are equivalent for any x, y
[0, 1) and any nonnegative integer n.
(i)  y ∈ J(x, n). (ii)  x ∈ J(y, n). (iii)  J(x, n) = J(y, n).
(2) If xm	is Fine-computable, then we can decide effectively whether xm I(n, k) or not for all m.
J(x, n) satisfies the axioms of the effective uniformity (cf. [10]). We call the topology generated by I(n, k) the Fine topology and put prefix Fine- to such notions. We put no prefix to notions which are defined by means of Euclidean topology.
A double sequence of dyadic rationals rn,m is said to be recursive if there exist recursive functions α(n, m), β(n, m) such that rn,m = β(n, m)2−α(n,m).
Definition 2.2	(1)	(Effective Fine-convergence of reals)	A double sequence
{xn,m} is said to Fine-converge effectively to {xn} if there exists a recursive function
α(n, k) which satisfies that m ≥ α(n, k) implies xn,m ∈ J(xn, k).

(2) (Fine-computable sequence of reals) A sequence of real numbers xm in [0, 1) is said to be Fine-computable if there exists a recursive double sequence of dyadic rationals {rn,m} which Fine-converges effective ly to {xm}.
If xn,m = xm and xn = x, we obtain the definition of effective Fine-convergence of {xm} to x.
Remark 2.3 (1) The original definition of a Fine-computable sequence of real numbers is that rn,m be a recursive sequence of rational numbers (cf. [11]). The present definition is equivalent to the original one.
The set of computable numbers and that of Fine-computable numbers co- incide.
A Fine-computable sequence is (Euclidean) computable.
ei will denote an effective enumeration of all nonnegative dyadic rationals in [0, 1). It is an effective separating set of the Fine-space [0, 1) (cf. [5]).
Definition 2.4 (Uniformly Fine-computable sequence of functions, [3,6]) A se- quence of functions fn is said to be uniformly Fine-computable if (i) and (ii) below hold.
(Sequential Fine-computability) The double sequence {fn(xm)} is com- putable for any Fine-computable sequence {xm}.
(Effectively uniform Fine-continuity) There exists a recursive function α(n, k) such that, for all n, k and all x, y ∈ [0, 1), y ∈ J(x, α(n, k)) implies |fn(x) − fn(y)| < 2−k.
Definition 2.5 (Effectively uniform convergence of functions, [3,6]). A double sequence of functions {gm,n} is said to converge effectively uniformly to a sequence of functions {fm} if there exists a recursive function α(m, k) such that, for all m, n and k, n ≥ α(m, k) implies |gm,n(x) − fm(x)| < 2−k for all x ∈ [0, 1).
Definition 2.6 (Fine-computable sequence of functions, [6]) A sequence of func- tions {fn} is said to be Fine-computable if it satisfies the following.
{fn} is sequentially Fine-computable.
(Effective Fine-Continuity) There exists a recursive function α(n, k, i) such that
(ii-a) x ∈ J(ei, α(n, k, i)) implies |fn(x) − fn(ei)| < 2−k,
(ii-b)   ∞  J(ei, α(n, k, i)) = [0, 1) for each n, k.
Definition 2.7 (Effective Fine-convergence of functions, [6]) We say that a double sequence of functions {gm,n} Fine-converges effectively to a sequence of functions
{fm} if there exist recursive functions α(m, k, i) and β(m, k, i), which satisfy
x ∈ J(ei, α(m, k, i)) and n ≥ β(m, k, i) imply |gm,n(x) − fm(x)| < 2−k,
∞ J(ei, α(m, k, i)) = [0, 1) for each m and k.
Definition 2.8 (Computable sequence of dyadic step functions, [3,6]) A sequence of functions {ϕn} is called a computable sequence of dyadic step functions if there exist a recursive function α(n) and a computable sequence of reals {cn,j} (0 ≤ j < 

2α(n), n = 1, 2,.. .) such that
ϕn

(x) = Σ2α(n)−1 c



n,j



χI(α(n),j)

(x),

where χA denotes the indicator (characteristic) function of A.
Proposition 2.9	([6])	Let f be a Fine-computable function. The computable sequence of dyadic step functions {ϕn}, which is deﬁned by

(1)
ϕ (x) = Σ2n−1 f (j2−n)χ

I(n,j)
(x),

Fine-converges effectively to f.
Moreover, if f is uniformly Fine-computable, then	ϕn	converges effectively uniformly to f.
We will briefly review effective integrability of functions on [0, 1). See [6,7,8] for details.
Definition 2.10  (Effective integrability of a sequence of functions, [7,8])
A sequence of Fine-computable functions {fn} is called effectively integrable if each

fn is integrable and of real numbers.

[0,1)
f +(x)dx} and {∫

[0,1)
f−(x)dx} are computable sequences

A Fine-computable function is said to be effectively integrable if the sequence
f, f, . . . is effectively integrable.
Integral on a finite union of fundamental dyadic intervals E is defined to be
∫[0,1) f (x)χE(x)dx.
It is easy to prove that a computable sequence of dyadic step functions is effec- tively integrable.
Theorem 2.11  (Effective bounded convergence theorem, [7,8]) Let gn  be a uni-
formly bounded Fine-computable sequence of functions which is effectively integrable and Fine-converges effectively to f. Then, f is Fine-computable and {∫[0,1) gn(x)dx} converges effectively to ∫[0,1) f (x)dx. As a consequence, f is effectively integrable.
Theorem 2.12 ([7,8]) A bounded Fine-computable function is effectively inte- grable.
Theorem 2.13 ([7,8]) Let {fn} be Fine-computable and effectively bounded, that is, there exists a computable sequence of reals {Mn} such that |fn(x)| ≤ Mn for all
x. Then {fn} is effectively integrable.
Theorem 2.14 (Effective dominated convergence theorem, [7,8]) Let gm,n be an effectively integrable Fine-computable sequence which Fine-converges effectively to   . Suppose that there exists an effectively integrable Fine-computable func-
tion h such that |gm,n(x)| ≤ h(x). Then, {∫[0,1) gm,n(x)dx} converges effectively to
∫[0,1) fm(x)dx.
Proposition 2.15  ([7,8]) Let f be an effectively integrable Fine-computable func-
tion and let In be a computable sequence of dyadic intervals such that  ∞  In =

[0, 1). Put En =  n	Ii. Then, ∫	f (x)dx converges effectively to ∫	f (x)dx, or
En	[0,1)
equivalently, ∫E C f (x)dx converges effectively to zero.
Uniformly Fine-computable functions on [0, 1)2
The main objective of this section is to prove uniform Fine-computability of f (x) = 
∫[0,1) F (x, y)dy for a uniformly Fine-computable function F (x, y) on [0, 1)2.
On the upper-right open unit square [0, 1)2, we denote [k2−n, (k + 1)2−n) [l2−m, (l + 1)2−m) with I2(n, m; k, l) and call it a fundamental dyadic rectangle. We also denote J(x, n) J(y, m) by J2(x, y; n, m) and call it a fundamental dyadic neigh- borhood of (x, y). We call the topology generated by the set J2(ei, ej; n, m) i,j,n,m the Fine-topology on [0, 1)2 and the space [0, 1)2 with this topology the two-dimensional Fine-space. Notions of computability on [0, 1)2 are defined with respect to the Fine- topology.
Note that {J2(x, y; n, n)} satisfies the axioms of the effective uniformity (cf. [10]), and the topology generated by the set {J2(ei, ej; n, n)} is equivalent.
Definition 3.1 (1) A double sequence {(xp,q, yp,q)} from [0, 1)2 is said to Fine- converges effectively to {(xp, yp)} if there exists a recursive function α(p, n, m) such that q ≥ α(p, n, m) implies (xp,q, yp,q) ∈ J2(xp, yp; n, m).
(2) A sequence {(xp, yp)} is said to be Fine-computable if there exist recursive sequences of dyadic rationals {sp,q} and {tp,q} such that {sp,q} and {tp,q} Fine- converge effectively to {xp} and {yp} respectively.
Lemma 3.2 (cf. Lemma 2.1) (1) The following three properties are equivalent for any (x, y), (z, w) ∈ [0, 1)2 and any positive integers n, m.
(i)  (z, w) ∈ J2(x, y; n, m). (ii)  (x, y) ∈ J2(z, w; n, m).
J(x, y; n, m) = J(z, w; n, m).
If {(xp, yp)} is Fine-computable, then we can decide effectively whether
(xp, yp) ∈ I2(n, m; k, l) or not.
In the following, we use the notation F (x, ) to designate the function F (x, y) regarded as a function of y (for each fixed x).
Definition 3.3 (Uniform Fine-computability) A function F (x, y) on [0, 1)2 is said to be uniformly Fine-computable if it satisfies the following two conditions.
(Sequential computability) {F (xn, ym)} is a computable double sequence of reals for every Fine-computable sequence {(xn, ym)}.
(Effective uniform Fine-continuity) There exist recursive functions α1(k) and α2(k) such that (x, y) ∈ J2(z, w; α1(k), α2(k)) implies |F (x, y) −F (z, w)| < 2−k.
Proposition 3.4 Let F (x, y) be uniformly Fine-computable as a function of (x, y). Then the following hold.
If xn is a Fine-computable sequence, then fn(y) = F (xn, y) is a uniformly Fine-computable sequence of functions on [0, 1) (Deﬁnition 2.4).

If a Fine-computable sequence {xm,n} Fine-converges effectively to {xm}, then {F (xm,n, ·)} converges effectively uniformly to {F (xm, ·)} (Deﬁnition 2.5).
Proof Let α1(k) and α2(k) be as in Definition 3.3.
Let ym  be a Fine-computable sequence of reals. Then fn(ym)  = F (xn, ym) is a computable sequence of reals due to the sequential computability of F (x, y). Then, fn(y)  fn(z) = F (xn, y)  F (xn, z) < 2−k if y  J(z, α2(k)), and hence follows effective uniform Fine-continuity.
From the effective Fine-convergence of {xm,n} to {xm}, there exists a re- cursive function β(m, l) such that n ≥ β(m, l) implies xm,n ∈ J(xm, l).
If we take δ(m, k) = β(m, α1(k)), then |F (xm,n, y) − F (xm, y)| < 2−k for n ≥
δ(m, k) and all y ∈ [0, 1).	 
It is pointed out in [4] that a uniformly Fine-computable function g(y) on [0, 1) is bounded and has a computable supremum. The latter property holds for a uniformly Fine-computable sequence of functions. These properties are easily deduced from Theorem 2 in [3]. We denote the supremum of |g| by ||g||.
Similarly, we can prove that a uniformly Fine-computable function F (x, y) takes a computable supremum.
Regarding uniform Fine-computability of F (x, y), we obtain the following theo- rem.
Theorem 3.5  For a function F (x, y), the following (i) and (ii) are equivalent.
F (x, y) is uniformly Fine-computable.
(ii-a)  {F (xn, ·)} is a uniformly Fine-computable sequence of functions on
[0, 1) for any Fine-computable sequence {xn}.
(ii-b)  There exists a recursive function α(k) such that, y ∈ J(x, α(k)) implies
||F (x, ·) − F (y, ·)|| < 2−k for all k.
Proof (i)⇒(ii): (ii-a) follows immediately from Proposition 3.4 (1).
To prove (ii-b), let us take α1(k) and α2(k) in Definition 3.3. If x ∈ J(y, α1(k + 1)), then (x, z) ∈ J2(y, z; α1(k + 1), α2(k + 1)) for all z ∈ [0, 1). So, |F (x, z) − F (y, z)| < 2−(k+1) and ||F (x, ·) − F (y, ·)|| < 2−k.
(ii)⇒(i): Let α(k) be the recursive function in (ii-b). Then, z ∈ J(x, α(k)) implies ||F (x, ·) − F (z, ·)|| < 2−k. Put rk,j = j2−α(k) for j = 0, 1,..., 2α(k) − 1. By (ii-a), the sequence {F (rk,j, ·)} is a uniform Fine-computable sequence of functions on [0, 1). So, there exists a recursive function β(k, j) such that y ∈ J(w, β(k, j)) implies |F (rk,j, y) − F (rk,j, w)| < 2−k.
Define γ(k) = max α(k + 2), β(k + 2, 0), β(k + 2, 1),..., β(k + 2, 2α(k+2)	1) and suppose that (x, y)	J2(z, w; γ(k), γ(k)). Since z	J(x, α(k + 2)), there exists a j, such that [j2−α(k+2), (j + 1)2−α(k+2)) contains both x and z. Therefore, we obtain
|F (x, y) − F (z, w)|
≤ |F (x, y) − F (rk+2,j, y)| + |F (rk+2,j, y) − F (rk+2,j, w)| + |F (rk+2,j, w) − F (z, w)|
< 3 · 2−(k+2) < 2−k.

This shows effective uniform Fine-continuity of F (x, y).
Let xn and ym be Fine-computable sequences. Then F (xn, ) is a uni- formly Fine-computable sequence of functions. This implies that F (xn, ym) is a computable sequence of reals.	 
It is easy to check that a uniformly Fine-computable function on [0, 1)2 is Lebesgue integrable and that its integral is a computable number, similarly to the case of uniformly Fine-computable functions on [0, 1) ([7]).
Theorem 3.6 (Effective Fubini’s Theorem for uniformly Fine-computable func- tions)
Let F (x, y) be a uniformly Fine-computable function. Then the following hold.
If xn	is Fine-computable, then F (xn, ) and F ( , xn) are uniformly Fine-computable sequences of functions on [0, 1).
∫[0,1) F (x, y)dy and ∫[0,1) F (x, y)dx are uniformly Fine-computable functions.
∫∫[0,1)2 F (x, y)dxdy is a computable number and
∫∫[0,1)2 F (x, y)dxdy = ∫[0,1) dx ∫[0,1) F (x, y)dy = ∫[0,1) dy ∫[0,1) F (x, y)dx.
Proof. (1) is Proposition 3.4 (1). The equation in (3) is a consequence of classical Fubini’s Theorem.
(2) To prove sequential computability, let xn be a Fine-computable sequence. Then	(	)	is a uniformly bounded uniformly Fine-computable sequence of
functions. Hence, {∫[0,1) F (xn, y)dy} is a computable sequence of reals by Theorem
Effective uniform Fine-continuity follows from the inequality
| ∫[0,1) F (x, y)dy − ∫[0,1) F (z, y)dy| ≤ ||F (x, ·) − F (z, ·)||
and Theorem 3.5 (ii-b).	 
We can easily extend (2) above as follows.
Theorem 3.7 Let F (x, y) be a uniformly Fine-computable function on [0, 1)2 and let g be an effectively integrable Fine-computable function on [0, 1). Then (Tg)(x) = 
∫[0,1) g(y)F (x, y)dy is uniformly Fine-computable.
Especially, the operator T maps any uniformly Fine-computable function to a uniformly Fine-computable function.
Proof First, we note that M = sup(x,y)∈[0,1)2 F (x, y) is computable if F (x, y) is uniformly Fine-computable on [0, 1)2.
Let xm be Fine-computable. Then g(y)F (xm, y) is a Fine-computable se- quence of functions of y by Theorem 3.6 (1). If we take the approximating com- putable sequence of dyadic step functions ϕm,n(y) which Fine-converges effectively to g(y)F (xm, y) , obtained by Proposition 2.9, then, it is obviously an effectively integrable Fine-computable sequence and satisfies	( )	( ) .  Hence,
{∫[0,1) ϕm,n(y)dy} converges effectively to {∫[0,1) g(y)F (xm, y)dy} by Theorem 2.14.
Therefore, {∫[0,1) g(y)F (xm, y)dy} is a computable sequence.
Effective uniform continuity follows from the following inequality;

| ∫[0,1) g(y)F (x, y)dy − ∫[0,1) g(y)F (z, y)dy| ≤ ||F (x, ·) − F (z, ·)|| ∫[0,1) |g(z)|dz. 
Fine-computable functions on [0, 1)2
In the following, we treat Fine-computability of f (x) = ∫[0,1) F (x, y)dy for a Fine- computable function F (x, y). First we define Fine-computability of functions on [0, 1)2, which is weaker than uniform Fine-computability (Definition 3.3), as follows.
Definition 4.1 (Fine-computable functions on [0, 1)2) Let F (x, y) be a function on [0, 1)2. F is said to be Fine-computable if it satisfies the following (i) and (ii).
F is sequentially computable.
(Effective Fine-continuity) There exist recursive functions α1(k, i, j) and
α2(k, i, j) which satisfy
(ii-a) (x, y) ∈ J2(ei, ej; α1(k, i, j), α2(k, i, j)) implies |F (x, y) − F (ei, ej)| < 2−k,
(ii-b)  ∞	J2(ei, ej; α1(k, i, j), α2(k, i, j)) = [0, 1)2 for each k.
We state the Proposition 3.1 in [6] for the case {ri} = {ei}.
Proposition 4.2 A function g on [0, 1) is effectively Fine-continuous if and only if there exist a recursive sequence of dyadic rationals rk,q and a recursive function δ(k, q) which satisfy the following.
x ∈ J(rk,q, δ(k, q)) implies |g(x) − g(rk,q)| < 2−k.
∞ J(rk,q, δ(k, q)) = [0, 1) for each k.
The intervals in J(rk,q, δ(k, q)) are mutually disjoint with respect to q for each k.
In the proof of Proposition 3.1 in [6], the crucial properties are those of Lemma 2.1, whose two-dimensional version is Lemma 3.2, and the fact that the complement of a finite (disjoint) union of fundamental dyadic intervals can be represented as a finite disjoint union of fundamental dyadic intervals. A similar fact also holds for fundamental dyadic rectangles. So, we can prove the following proposition.
Proposition 4.3 Effective Fine-continuity of a function F on [0, 1)2 is equiva- lent to the following: There exist a recursive sequence of pairs of dyadic rationals (sk,p, tk,p) and recursive functions β1(k, p), β2(k, p) which satisfy the following three conditions.
(x, y) ∈ J2(sk,p, tk,p; β1(k, p), β2(k, p)) implies |F (x, y) −F (sk,p, tk,p)| < 2−k.
∞  J2(sk,p, tk,p; β1(k, p), β2(k, p)) = [0, 1)2 for each k.
The fundamental dyadic neighborhoods in  J2(sk,p, tk,p; β1(k, p), β2(k, p))
are mutually disjoint with respect to p for each k.
Remark 4.4 The conditions (b) and (c) in Proposition 4.3 signify that the upper- right open square [0, 1)2 is partitioned into (infinitely many) disjoint rectangles
{J2(sk,p, tk,p; β1(k, p), β2(k, p))} for each k. Hence, the following hold:
For any k and any (x, y) ∈ [0, 1)2, there is the unique number p(k, x, y) such that (x, y) is contained in J2(sk,p(k,x,y), tk,p(k,x,y); β1(k, p(k, x, y)), β2(k, p(k, x, y))).

Moreover, (z, w)	J2(sk,p(k,x,y), tk,p(k,x,y); β1(k, p(k, x, y)), β2(k, p(k, x, y))) implies
p(k, x, y) = p(k, z, w).
If (xn, yn) is Fine-computable, then i(k, n) = p(k, xn, yn) is a recursive function.
Proposition 4.5  Let F (x, y) be Fine-computable. Then the following hold.
If xm  is a Fine-computable sequence of reals, then F (xm, )  is a Fine- computable sequence of functions.
If {xm,n} is a Fine-computable sequence of reals and Fine-converges effec- tively to {xm}, then {F (xm,n, ·)} Fine-converges effectively to {F (xm, ·)}.
Proof. Let us take {(sk,p, tk,p)} and β1(k, p), β2(k, p) in Proposition 4.3.
Proof of (1):  We prove (i) and (ii) in Definition 2.6 for {F (xm, ·)}.
(i): Sequential computability of F (xm, ) is an easy consequence of sequential computability of F (x, y).
(ii-a): For each m, k and j, we can find effectively and uniquely such p = p(m, k, j) that (xm, ej) is contained in J2(sk+1,p, tk+1,p; β1(k + 1, p), β2(k + 1, p)) by Remark 4.4.  Define α(m, k, j) = β2(k + 1, p(m, k + 1, j)) and suppose that y ∈ J(ej, α(m, k, j)).
Then (xm, y) is also contained in J2(sk+1,p, tk+1,p; β1(k + 1, p), β2(k + 1, p)). So, we obtain
|F (xm, y) − F (xm, ej)|
≤ |F (xm, y) − F (sk+1,p, tk+1,p)| + |F (sk+1,p, tk+1,p) − F (xm, ej)| < 2−k.
(ii-b):  Let us take p = p(k, xm, y) for arbitrary y   [0, 1), as in Remark
Then, J2(sk+1,p, tk+1,p; β1(k + 1, p), β2(k + 1, p)) contains (xm, ej) for some dyadic rational ej. By Remark 4.4 (a), we obtain p(k, xm, y) = p(k, xm, ej) and J2(sk+1,p, tk+1,p; β1(k + 1, p), β2(k + 1, p)) = J2(xm, ej; β1(k + 1, p), β2(k + 1, p)).
Hence,  ∞  J(ej, α(m, k, j)) = [0, 1) holds.
Proof of (2): We note first that xm is a Fine-computable sequence. Let γ(m, l) be an effective modulus of effective Fine-convergence. That is, it satisfies that n ≥ γ(m, l) implies xm,n ∈ J(xm, l).
For any m and ej, we can find effectively and uniquely such p = p(m, j) that J2(sk+1,p, tk+1,p; β1(k + 1, p), β2(k + 1, p)) contains (xm, ej). We note that J(sk+1,p, β1(k + 1, p)) = J(xm, β1(k + 1, p)) by Lemma 2.1.
If n ≥ γ(m, β1(k + 1, p)) and y ∈ J(tk+1,p, β2(k + 1, p)) = J(ej, β2(k + 1, p)), then
|F (xm,n, y) − F (xm, y)|
≤ |F (xm,n, y) −F (sk+1,p, tk+1,p)| + |F (sk+1,p, tk+1,p) −F (xm, y)| < 2 · 2−(k+1) = 2−k.
By Proposition 4.3 (b),  J(sk+1,p,β1(k+1,p))$x J(tk+1,p, β2(k + 1, p)) = [0, 1) for all k, and hence, j J(ej, β2(k + 1, p)) = [0, 1). This proves the effective Fine- convergence of F (xm,n, ) to F (xm, ) with respect to α(k, j) = β2(k+1, p(m, j)) and δ(k, i) = γ(m, β1(k + 1, p(m, j))) (cf. Definition 2.7).	 
In the rest of this section, we investigate Fine-computability of the function

f (x) = ∫[0,1) F (x, y)dy for a bounded Fine-computable function F (x, y).
Theorem 4.6 If F (x, y) is bounded and Fine-computable on [0, 1)2, then f (x) = 
∫[0,1) F (x, y)dy is Fine-computable on [0, 1).
Outline of the proof of Effective Fine-continuity:  Let us take (sk,p, tk,p)  and β1(k, p), β2(k, p) in Proposition 4.3. Then, we construct a function N (k, x), on N+ [0, 1), functions h(k, x, l), α1(k, x, l), α2(k, x, l) on N+	[0, 1)	1, 2,...,N (k, x) and sequences uk,x,l, vk,x,l for each k, x and 1 ≤ l ≤ N (k, x), which satisfy the following:
Dyadic intervals {J(vk,x,l, α2(k, x, l))}1≤l≤N(k,x) are mutually disjoint.
ΣN (k,x) 2−α2(k,x,l) > 1 − 2−k.
y ∈ J(vk,x,l, α2(k, x, l)) and z ∈ J(uk,x,l, α1(k, x, l)) imply
|F (x, y) − F (z, y)| < 2−k due to Proposition 4.3 (a) for 1 ≤ l ≤ N (k, x).
uk,x,l ≤ x < uk,x,l + 2−α1(k,x,l) for 1 ≤ l ≤ N (k, x).
Define ξ(k, x) = max1≤l≤N (k,x) uk,x,l and η(k, x) = min1≤l≤N (k,x) uk,x,l+2−α1(k,x,l).
Then, [ξ(k, x), η(k, x)) is a dyadic interval and contains x.  So, we can define
γ(k, x) as min{l| J(x, l) ⊂ [ξ(k, x), η(k, x))}.
Properties of γ(k, x) and N (k, x):
If z	J(x, γ(k, x)), then N (k, z) = N (k, x).  Moreover, uk,x,l = uk,z,l,
vk,x,l = vk,z,l and αi(k, x, l) = αi(k, z, l) for 1 ≤ l ≤ N (k, x).
If y ∈  N (k,x) J(vk,x,l, α2(k, x, l)) and z ∈ J(x, γ(k, x)), then
|F (x, y) − F (z, y)| < 2−k.
|  N (k,x) J(vk,x,l, α2(k, x, l))| = ΣN (k,x) 2−α2(k,x,l) > 1 − 2−k.
Moreover, N (k, ei), αi(k, ei, l) (i = 1, 2) and γ(k, ei) can be regarded as recursive functions. While, uk,ei,l and vk,ei,l can be regarded as computable sequences of dyadic rationals.
From boundedness of F (x, y), there exists an integer K such that F (x, y) < 2K for all (x, y). Now, if we define δ(k, i) = γ(k + K + 2, ei), then δ is a recur- sive function.  Suppose that x   J(e , δ(k, i)) = J(e , γ(k + K + 2, e )), and put
Ek,i =  N (k,ei) J(vk,e ,l, α2(k, ei, l)). Then, Ek,i =  N (k,x) J(vk,x,l, α2(k, x, l)), and

l=1	i
we obtain
l=1

|f (x) − f (ei)| ≤ ∫Ek,i |F (x, y) − F (ei, y)|dy + ∫(Ek,i)C |F (x, y)|dy + ∫(Ek,i)C |F (ei, y)|dy
< 2−(k+K+2) +2 · 2K 2−(k+K+2) < 2−k.
For all x ∈ [0, 1), J(x, δ(k, x)) contains a dyadic rational, say, ei. By property (i),
J(x, δ(k, i)) = J(ei, δ(k, i)). So x ∈ J(ei, δ(k, i)) and we obtain  ∞ J(ei, δ(k, i)) =
[0, 1). This proves effective Fine-continuity of f (x).	 
Example 1.3 in Introduction shows that the conclusion of Theorem 4.6 does not hold for a Fine-computable function in general. Therefore, for general Fine- computable functions, we need an additional condition on integrability.
We give a sufficient condition that assures the Fine-computability of f (x) for a

Fine-computable function F (x, y).
Theorem 4.7 If F (x, y) is Fine-computable and there exists an effectively inte- grable Fine-computable function ( ) which satisﬁes	(	)	( ) for all  , then
f (x) = ∫[0,1) F (x, y)dy is Fine-computable.
