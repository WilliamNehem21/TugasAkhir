Abstract
In this paper, we answer a long-standing open question proposed by Bodlaender in 1991: the game chromatic number is PSPACE-hard. We also prove that the game Grundy number is PSPACE-hard. In fact, we prove that both problems (the graph coloring game and the greedy coloring game) are PSPACE-Complete even if the number of colors is the chromatic number. Despite this, we prove that the game Grundy number is equal to the chromatic number for several superclasses of cographs, extending a result of Havet and Zhu in 2013.
Keywords: Coloring game, game chromatic number, greedy coloring, Grundy number, PSPACE-hardness.


Introduction
In the graph coloring game, given a graph G and a set C of integers, two players (Alice and Bob) alternate their turns (starting with Alice) in choosing an uncolored vertex to be colored by an integer of C not already assigned to one of its colored neighbors. In the greedy coloring game, the vertices must be colored by the least possible integer of C. Alice wins if all vertices are successfully colored. Otherwise, Bob wins the game. The game chromatic number χg(G) and the game Grundy num- ber Γg(G) are the least numbers of colors in the set C for which Alice has a winning strategy in the graph coloring game and the greedy coloring game, respectively.
Clearly, χg(G) ≥ χ(G) and χ(G) ≤ Γg(G) ≤ Γ(G), where χ(G) is the chromatic number of G and Γ(G) is the Grundy number of G (the maximum number of colors that can be used by a greedy coloring of G).

The graph coloring game was first considered by Brams about 38 years ago in the context of coloring maps and was described by Gardner in 1981 in his “Mathematical Games” column of Scientific American [9]. It remained unnoticed until Bodlaender
[2] reinvented it in 1991 as the “Coloring Construction Game”. Bodlaender left the complexity of the problem as an open question. In his own words, “the complexity of the Color Construction Game is an interesting open problem”.
Since then, the graph coloring game became a very active topic of research. In 1993, Faigle et al. [8] proved that χg(G) ≤ 4 for forests and, in 2007, Sidorowicz
[18] proved that χg(G) ≤ 5 for cacti. In 1994, Kierstead and Trotter [13] proved that χg(G) ≤ 7 for outerplanar graphs. In 1999, Dinski and Zhu proved that χg(G) ≤ k(k + 1) for every graph with acyclic chromatic number k [6]. In 2000, Zhu proved that χg(G) ≤ 3k + 2 for partial k-trees [20]. For planar graphs, Zhu [21] proved in 2008 that χg(G) ≤ 17, Sekiguchi [17] proved in 2014 that χg(G) ≤ 13 if the girth is at least 4 and Nakprasit et al. [15] proved in 2018 that χg(G) ≤ 5 if the girth is at least 7. In 2008, Bohman, Frieze and Sudakov [3] investigated the asymptotic behavior of χg(Gn,p) for the random graph Gn,p.
Despite this, little progress was obtained in the complexity of the problem. In 2015, Dunn, Larsen, Lindke, Retter and Toci [7] investigated it and stated, in their own words, that “more than two decades later, this question remains open”. They obtained partial progress on the complexity of the game chromatic number of a forest.
The greedy coloring game and the game Grundy number were introduced by Havet and Zhu [11] in 2013. They proved that Γg(G) ≤ 3 in forests and Γg(G) ≤ 7 in partial 2-trees. They also posed two questions regarding the game Grundy number:
Problem 5 of [11]: χg(G) can be bounded by a function of Γg(G)?
Problem 6 of [11]: Is it true that Γg(G) ≤ χg(G) for every graph G?
In 2015, Krawczyk and Walczak [14] answered Problem 5 of [11] in the negative: χg(G) is not upper bounded by a function of Γg(G). To the best of our knowledge, Problem 6 of [11] is still open.
In this paper, we prove that the graph coloring game and the greedy coloring game are PSPACE-Complete problems even if the number of colors is the chromatic number. That is, the game chromatic number and the game Grundy number are PSPACE-hard.
In 2013, Havet and Zhu showed that Γg(G)= χ(G) for any cograph (see Propo- sition 9 of [11]). In this paper, we extend this by proving that Γg(G) = χ(G) for several known superclasses of cographs, as P4-sparse graphs, P4-tidy graphs and P4-laden graphs. For those graph classes, Γ(G) can be larger than χ(G) as much as desired. Moreover, for those graph classes, Alice has a winning strategy with χ(G) colors in the greedy coloring game even if Bob starts the game and can pass any turn.

Game chromatic number is PSPACE-hard
As pointed out by Zhu [19], the graph coloring game “exhibits some strange prop- erties” and the following “naive” question is still open (Question 1 of [19]): Does Alice have a winning strategy for the coloring game with k + 1 colors if she has a winning strategy with k colors?
With this, we can define two decision problems for the coloring game: given a graph G and an integer k,
(Game Coloring Problem 1) χg(G) ≤ k ?
(Game Coloring Problem 2) Does Alice have a winning strategy with k colors? Game Coloring Problems 1 and 2 are equivalent if and only if Question 1 of [19]
is true.
In this section, we prove that the following more restricted Game Coloring Prob- lem 3 is PSPACE-Complete: given a graph G and its chromatic number χ(G),
(Game Coloring Problem 3) χg(G)= χ(G) ? 
It is easy to see that Game Coloring Problems 1 and 2 are generalizations of Game Coloring Problem 3, since both problems are equivalent to it for k = χ(G). Notice that χg(G) ≤ k = χ(G) if and only if χg(G)= χ(G), which is true if and only if Alice has a winning strategy with k = χ(G) colors. Then the PSPACE-hardness of Game Coloring Problem 3 implies the PSPACE-hardness of Game Coloring Prob- lems 1 and 2.
We obtain a reduction from the POS-CNF problem, which is known to be log- complete in PSPACE [16]. In POS-CNF, we are given a set {X1,..., XN } of N variables and a CNF formula (conjunctive normal form) with M clauses C1,..., CM , in which only positive variables appear (that is, no negations of variables). Two players (Alice and Bob) alternate turns setting a previously unset variable True or False. After all N variables are set, Alice wins if and only if the formula is True. Clearly, since there are only positive variables, we can assume that Alice and Bob always set variables True and False, respectively. We may assume that no clause contains all variables, since it is trivially satisfied.
One important ingredient of the reduction is the graph F1 of Figure 2, which has a universal vertex s, two cliques K(1) and K(2) both with β − 1 vertices and two independent sets I(1) = {r1,..., r2β} and I(2) = {t1,..., t2β} both with 2β vertices. Each vertex of I(i) is adjacent to all vertices in K(i) for i ∈ {1, 2}. We start by proving that, with 2β − 1 colors, Alice wins the game in F1 if and only if she is the first one to play and, in this case, she must color vertex s first.
Lemma 2.1 Alice has a winning strategy for the graph F1 of Figure 1 in the graph coloring game with 2β − 1 colors if and only if she is the ﬁrst to play. In this case, she must color vertex s ﬁrst. Moreover, a winning strategy also exists even if the opponnent can pass any turn.
Proof. Without loss of generality, suppose that Alice in her first turn colors some vertex in K(2) ∪ I(2). Then, Bob has a winning strategy that consists, on his every



F1

turn, to color one vertex of I(1) with a new color. If Bob uses this strategy, on the end of his β turn, we have that: I(1) has at least β colored vertices each with a different color. Since K(1) ∪ {s} is a clique with β vertices adjacent to every vertex of I(1), then it is not possible to color F1 with 2β − 1 colors.
We now show that there is a winning strategy strategy for Alice, using 2β − 1 colors. In her first turn Alice colors vertex s with color 1. For each subsequent turn Alice chooses the least available color to color a vertex following this order of priority: (a) a vertex of K(i), if Bob colored a vertex of K(i) ∪ I(i), (b) if all vertices of one of the cliques K(i) are colored, she colors an uncolored vertex of the other clique, and (c) any vertex of F1, if all vertices of K(1) and K(2) are colored.
Without loss of generality suppose that both players play only on K(1)∪I(1)∪{s}. Consider some turn in which K(1) is completely colored. Note that, in this turn, Bob has played at most β − 1 times. Then, they have used β colors in K(1) ∪ {s} and at most β − 1 colors in I(1). Since each vertex in I(1) can share the same colors of any vertex in I(1), they have used at most β + β − 1 colors and all uncolored vertices of I(1) can be colored with any color already used in I(1).	2
Theorem 2.2 Given a graph G, deciding whether χg(G) = χ(G) is PSPACE- Complete. Consequently, if k is an integer, deciding whether χg(G) ≤ k or deciding if Alice has a winning strategy with k colors are PSPACE-Complete problems.
Proof. [Sketch] It is not difficult to see that the three decision problems are in PSPACE. Given a POS-CNF formula with N variables X1,..., XN and M clauses C1,..., CM , let pj (for j = 1,...,M ) be the size of clause Cj and let qi (for i = 1,...,N ) be the number of clauses containing the variable Xi. Let p = maxj=1,...,M {pj} and q = maxi=1,. ,N {qi}. That is, every clause has at most p
variables and every variable appears in at most q clauses. Let β = max{p, q, 4N}+2. We will construct a graph G such that χ(G)= 2β − 1 and χg(G)= 2β − 1 if and only if Alice has a winning strategy for the POS-CNF formula.
Initially, the constructed graph G is the graph F1 of Figure 1. Add to G a new vertex y. For every variable Xi, create a vertex xi in G. For every clause Cj, we will create a clause clique for it. First create a clique with vertices lj,1,..., lj,pj and join lj,k to xi with an edge if and only if both are associated to the same variable, for k = 1,. , pj. Also add the new vertex lj,0 (which is not associated to variables)
and join it with an edge to the vertex y. For every vertex lj,k (j = 1,...,M and

k = 0,..., pj), replace it by two true-twin vertices lj
and ljj
, which are adjacent

vertices with same neighborhood of lj,k. Moreover, add to the clause clique of Cj a clique Lj with size 2(β − pj) − 3 ≥ 4N and join all vertices of Lj to s. With this,

each vertex lj,k represents two true-twins l′
and l′′
; L1, L2, L3, L4 are cliques with 29 vertices. Bob

has a winning strategy with 35 colors in the graph coloring game.

all clause cliques have exactly 2β − 1 vertices.
Figure 2 shows the constructed graph G for the formula (X1 ∨X2) ∧ (X1 ∨X3) ∧ (X2 ∨X4)∧(X3 ∨X4). Notice that Bob has a winning strategy: if Alice sets X1 True, Bob sets X4 False; if Alice sets X4 True, Bob sets X1 False; if Alice sets X2 True, Bob sets X3 False; if Alice sets X3 True, Bob sets X2 False. In the reduction of this example, we have N = 4 variables, M = 4 clauses, p = 2, q = 2, β = 4N +2 = 18 and the cliques L1 to LM have 2(β − p) − 3 = 29 vertices each.
It is easy to verify that χ(G)= 2β − 1. Color s with color 1, color the vertex y and every vertex xi (i = 1,..., n) with color 2β − 1. The vertices of each clique of F1 can be colored with colors 2 to β and each independent set of F1 can be colored

using color β + 1. For every j = 1,...,M , color the vertices lj
and ljj
with colors

2k +1 and 2k +2 (k = 0,..., pj). Finally, color the vertices of the clique Lj using the colors 2pj + 3,..., 2β − 1. Since the cliques representing clauses contains 2β − 1 vertices, then χ(G)= 2β − 1.
In the following, we show that Alice has a winning strategy in the graph coloring game if and only if she has a winning strategy in POS-CNF. From Lemma 2.1, in her first move, Alice must color vertex s of F1, since otherwise F1 cannot be colored with 2β − 1 colors. Also notice that all variable vertices have degree at most 2q < 2β − 1 and then can always be colored with a color in {1,..., 2β−1}. We show that vertex y will be colored in the three first turns. With this, every vertex of a clause clique has degree exactly 2β−1. In order to be colored using the colors of {1,..., 2β−1}, Alice must guarantee that all colors appearing in the outside neighbors of a clause clique also appears inside the clique. On the other hand, we show that Bob’s strategy is making all outside neighbors of a clause clique to be colored with the same color of s (which will represent False in POS-CNF) and thus impeding Alice of using this color inside the clause clique.
We first show that if Bob has a winning strategy in the POS-CNF game, then
χg(G) > 2β − 1. Assume that Bob wins in the POS-CNF game and Alice starts

by coloring s with color 1 (recall Lemma 2.1). Bob can use the following strategy. In his first turn, he colors y with color 1, then at each subsequent turn: if Alice colors a vertex in N [xi] (the closed neighborhood of xi) for some i, Bob considers that she marked Xi true in the POS-CNF game and colors with color 1 the vertex xj representing the literal Xj chosen by him in his winning POS-CNF strategy; if Alice does not color any vertex in N [xi] for some i, then Bob plays as if Alice has passed her turn in the POS-CNF game. Since Bob has a winning strategy in the POS-CNF game, at some point all literals of some clause will be marked false. This means that all neighbors outside some clause clique will be colored with color
1. Since the clique has 2β − 1 vertices and color 1 cannot be used, we have that
χg(G) > 2β − 1.
We now show that if Alice has a winning strategy in the POS-CNF game then χg(G) = 2β − 1. Assume that Alice wins in the POS-CNF game and she colors vertex s of F1 (with color 1).
At first, suppose that Bob does not color y with color 1 in his first turn. Then, in the next round, Alice can guarantee that y receives a color distinct from 1. After this, she can always color a vertex inside any clause clique with color 1 (for example,

j
i,0
jj
i,0
or other). Since each clique Lj has at least 4N vertices, then Alice can also

color all variable vertices and guarantee that all colors of the variable vertices appear
in Lj.
Thus assume that Bob colors vertex y with color 1. With this, Alice can play using the following strategy: (1) if Bob plays in a vertex of F1 then she plays with her winning strategy in F1 from Lemma 2.1; (2) if Bob plays on some twin obtained from vertex li,j then Alice plays the least available color in the other twin; (3) if Bob plays on some Lj then Alice plays as if Bob has passed his turn on the POS-CNF game, meaning that she chooses a vertex xj and color it with a color different from 1 where Xj is the literal chosen by her winning strategy in the POS-CNF game;
(4) if Bob plays on xi, then Alice plays as if Bob has chosen Xi to be false in the POS-CNF game; (5) if the other moves are not possible, then Alice chooses any vertex of G and color it with the least available color.
By following this strategy, when the POS-CNF game finishes, every clause clique has some outside neighbor with color different from 1 or a vertex colored with color
1. With this, Alice and Bob can finish coloring every clause cliques using colors 1,..., 2β − 1, since Alice can guarantee that every clique with 2β − 1 vertices receive all colors of its ouside neighbors (recall again that each clique Lj has at least 4N vertices)	2
3  Game Grundy number is PSPACE-hard
Similar results can also be obtained for the game Grundy number. Unlike in the game coloring problem, the greedy game coloring problem satisfies the following:
Proposition 3.1 If Alice has a winning strategy with k colors in the greedy game coloring problem, then Alice has also a winning strategy with k +1 colors.


F2



Fig. 3. Graph F2: with 3 colors, the first to move wins the greedy game
Thus we can define the decision problem for the greedy coloring game: given a graph G and an integer k,
(Greedy Game Coloring Problem 1) Γg(G) ≤ k? That is, does Alice have a winning strategy using k colors in the greedy coloring game?
In this section, we prove that the following more restricted Greedy Game Col- oring Problem 2 is PSPACE-Complete: given a graph G and its chromatic number χ(G),
(Greedy Game Coloring Problem 2) Γg(G) = χ(G)? That is, does Alice have a winning strategy using χ(G) colors in the greedy coloring game?
It is easy to see that Greedy Game Coloring Problem 1 is a generalization of Greedy Game Coloring Problem 2 (just set k = χ(G)). Then the PSPACE-hardness of Greedy Game Coloring Problem 2 implies the PSPACE-hardness of Greedy Game Coloring Problem 1.
We obtain a very similar reduction from the POS-CNF problem (as shown in Section 2 for the game coloring problem). One important ingredient of the reduction is the graph F2 of Figure 3. We start by proving that, with 3 colors, Alice wins the game in F2 if and only she is the first one to play and, in this case, she must color vertex s first.
Lemma 3.2 Alice has a winning strategy for the graph F2 of Figure 3 in the greedy coloring game with 3 colors if and only if she is the ﬁrst to play. In this case, she must color vertex s ﬁrst.
Proof. Suppose that Alice is the first to play and colors vertex r first (color 1 in the greedy game). Then Bob can color vertex t2 (color 1). With this, s and t cannot be colored 1 and then Bob can force t1 or t3 be colored with 4 by coloring one of the two black vertices (color 1) in his next turn.
Now suppose that Alice is the first to play and colors vertex s first (color 1). Thus no vertex in {r1, r2, r3, t1, t2, t3} can be colored 1 and then all black vertices will be colored 1 in the greedy game coloring. Therefore all vertices in {r1, r2, r3, t1, t2, t3} can be colored with 2 or 3 in the game. Moreover, Alice can color r and t in her second and third turns using the colors {2, 3} winning the game.
Finally suppose that Bob is the first to play. He can win the game by coloring vertex r2 first (color 1). In his next turn, he can color the black neighbor of r1 or r3 (color 1). With this, r1 or r3 will be colored 4, and Bob wins the game.	2
Theorem 3.3 Given a graph G, deciding whether Γg(G) = χ(G) is PSPACE- Complete.  Consequently, if k is an integer, deciding whether Γg(G) ≤ k is a

PSPACE-Complete problem.
Proof. [Sketch] We will follow almost the same reduction (from POS-CNF) of Theorem 2.2, including a neighbor xi of degree 1 to each vertex xi and replacing the graph F1 by the graph F2 with all vertices adjacent to a new clique L0 with 2β − 4 vertices. Also, in this case, we have that Lj is a clique with 2(β − pj) − 3 vertices, for 1 ≤ j ≤ M .
Figure 3 shows the constructed graph G for the same formula (X1 ∨ X2) ∧ (X1 ∨ X3) ∧ (X2 ∨ X4) ∧ (X3 ∨ X4). In the reduction of this example, we have the same values N = 4 variables, M = 4 clauses, p = 2, q = 2, β = 4N + 2 = 18, clique L0 has 2β − 4 = 32 vertices and cliques L1 to LM with 2(β − p) − 3 = 29 vertices each. As in Theorem 2.2, χ(G)= 2β − 1. Using similar arguments as in the proof of Theorem 2.2, we obtain the result. The main difference is that, instead of coloring a vertex xi with a color different from 1, Alice should color the vertex xi with color

4	Game Grundy number of graphs with few P4’s
As mentioned in the introduction, Havet and Zhu showed in 2013 that Γg(G)= χ(G) for any cograph (see Proposition 9 of [11]), since χ(G)= Γ(G) in cographs. In this section, we prove that this also happens for known superclasses of cographs, as P4- sparse graphs, P4-tidy graphs and P4-laden graphs, such that Γ(G) can be larger than χ(G) as much as desired.
A cograph is a graph with no induced P4 [5]. A graph G is P4-sparse if every set of five vertices in G induces at most one P4 [12]. P4-sparse graphs have a nice structural decomposition in terms of unions, joins and spiders. Given graphs G1 = (V1, E1) and G2 = (V2, E2), the union of G1 and G2 is the graph G1 ∪G2 = (V1 ∪V2, E1 ∪E2) and the join of G1 and G2 is the graph G1 ∨ G2 = (V1 ∪ V2, E1 ∪ E2 ∪ {uv : u ∈

V1,v ∈ V2}). A spider is a graph whose vertex set has a partition (R, C, S), where C = {c1,..., ck} and S = {s1,..., sk} for k ≥ 2 are respectively a clique and a stable set; si is adjacent to cj if and only if i = j (a thin spider), or si is adjacent to cj if and only if i /= j (a thick spider); and every vertex of R is adjacent to each vertex of C and non-adjacent to each vertex of S. Notice that the complement of a thin spider is a thick spider, and vice-versa. Jamison and Olariu [12] proved that, if a graph G is P4-sparse, then G is the disjoint union or the join of two P4-sparse graphs, or G is a spider (R, C, S) such that G[R] is a P4-sparse graph, or G has at most one vertex.
As an example, the following sequence (Gk) of P4-sparse graphs satisfies Γg(Gk) = χ(Gk) = 2k and Γ(Gk) = 3k. Let G1 be a P4 a1b1c1d1. For k ≥ 2, let Gk be obtained from the join of Gk—1 with a P4 akbkckdk. Clearly, χ(Gk)= 2k: color ai and ci with color 2i− 1 and color bi and di with color 2i for every 1 ≤ i ≤ k. Moreover, Γ(Gk) = 3k: color ai and di with color 3i − 2 and color bi and ci with colors 3i− 1 and 3i, respectively. Finally, Γg(Gk)= 2k: Alice can always avoid that both endpoints ai and di of a P4 aibicidi receive the same color.
We say that a graph is extended P4-laden if every induced subgraph with at most six vertices that contains more than two induced P4’s is {2K2, C4}-free. This graph class was introduced in [10], and a motivation to develop algorithms for ex- tended P4-laden graphs lies on the fact that they are on the top of a widely studied hierarchy of classes containing many graphs with few P4’s (see Figure 5), includ- ing cographs, P4-sparse, P4-lite, P4-laden and P4-tidy graphs. Therefore, solving interesting problems in an efficient way for extended P4-laden graphs immediately imply efficient, generalized algorithms for all these classes. Another motivation is that extended P4-laden graphs are not contained in perfect graphs; hence this work obtains coloring results not specifically related to perfection. There are recent pa- pers dealing with coloring problems in extended P4-laden graphs. For example, in the Grundy number [1] and in the cochromatic number [4].
Giakoumakis [10] proved an important structural characterization for extended P4-laden graphs by special graphs, called pseudo-splits and quasi-spiders. Given a split graph G with vertex set partition (C, S), where C is a clique and S is an

independent set, we say that G is original if every vertex in S has a non-neighbor in C and every vertex in C has a neighbor in S. We say that a graph G is a pseudo- split if its vertex set has a partition (R, C, S) such that S induces an independent set, C induces a clique, C ∪ S induces an original split graph and every vertex of R is adjacent to every vertex of C and non-adjacent to every vertex of S. Notice that the complement of a pseudo-split is also a pseudo-split and that spiders are pseudo-split graphs. A quasi-spider is a graph obtained from a spider (R, C, S) with at most one vertex from C ∪ S replaced by K2 or K2 (keeping the neighborhood). Clearly, every spider is a quasi-spider.
Theorem 4.1 ([10]) A graph G is extended P4-laden if and only if exactly one of the following holds:
G is the disjoint union or the join of two non-empty extended P4-laden graphs.
G is a quasi-spider or a pseudo-split graph (R, C, S) such that G[R] is an extended
P4-laden graph.
G is isomorphic to C5, P5, P5, or has at most one vertex.
To determine Γg(G) for extended P4-laden graphs, we introduce the parameter Γj (G): the minimum number of colors such that Alice has a winning strategy in greedy coloring game even if Bob can start the game and also can pass any turn (that is, does not color a vertex in a turn). Notice that Γg(G) ≤ Γj (G). We will prove that Γj (G) = χ(G) for extended P4-laden graphs, implying that Γg(G) = χ(G) in this graph class. In the following, we obtain upper bounds on the union and join operations.
Lemma 4.2 Given graphs G1 and G2,
Γj (G1 ∨ G2) ≤ Γj (G1) + Γj (G2) and
g	g	g
Γj (G1 ∪ G2) ≤ max{Γj (G1), Γj (G2)}.
g	g	g
Proof. [Sketch] Alice only has to play in the same graph that Bob has played following her best strategy in this graph. If there is no uncolored vertex, Alice colors a vertex in the other graph (in this case, she considers that Bob passed his turn in this graph).	2
Lemma 4.3 If G is a quasi-spider or a pseudo-split graph (R, C, S), then Γj (G)= 
χ(G). If G is isomorphic to C5, P5 or P5, then Γj (G)= χ(G).
Proof. [Sketch] There are some cases to analyse, which will be omitted because of space restrictions. In most cases, Alice only has to avoid that Bob colors all vertices of the independent set S with color 1.	2
With this, we obtain our main theorem for extended P4-laden graphs.
Theorem 4.4 If G is an extended P4-laden graph, then Γg(G) = Γj (G) = χ(G), which can be computed in linear time. That is, Alice can win the greedy coloring game with χ(G) colors in extended P4-laden graphs even if Bob starts the game and can also pass any turn.

Proof. [Sketch] It follows by induction from Theorem 4.1 and Lemmas 4.2 and 4.3, since χ(G1 ∨ G2)= χ(G1)+ χ(G2) and χ(G1 ∪ G2)= max{χ(G1), χ(G2)} for any graphs G1 and G2.	2

5	Final remarks
In this paper, we proved in Theorems 2.2 and 3.3 that, given a graph G and an inte- ger k, deciding whether χg(G) ≤ k or Γg(G) ≤ k are PSPACE-Complete problems. In the proofs of Theorems 2.2 and 3.3, the value of k obtained in the reductions (which is k = χ(G)) can be very high. Considering only k = 2 colors in a connected graph G, it is known that χg(G) ≤ 2 if and only if G is a star K1,n. For the greedy coloring game, we have the following characterization:
Lemma 5.1 A connected graph G has Γg(G)=2 if and only if G is bipartite with a vertex whose neighborhood is one of the parts of the bipartition.
Proof. If Γg(G)= 2, then G must be bipartite since χ(G) ≤ Γg(G) = 2. Moreover, if G is not bipartite, then Γg(G) ≥ χ(G) > 2. Then assume that G is bipartite with bipartition (A, B).
Without loss of generality, suppose that G has a vertex v of A whose neighbor- hood is B. If Alice colors v in her first turn (color 1), then no vertex of B can be colored 1 and consequently all vertices of A will be colored 1. Thus all vertices of B will be colored 2.
Now suppose that every vertex of A has a non-neighbor in B and that every vertex of B has a non-neighbor in A. Let w be the first vertex colored by Alice. Assume without loss of generality that w ∈ A. Since G is connected, then w has a non-neighbor z in B at distance 3 (that is, w and z are the endpoints of a P4). Thus, coloring z in his first turn (color 1), Bob forces 3 colors in this P4.	2
However, for k = 3 colors, the complexity of the greedy game coloring is not known.
Conjecture 5.2 Deciding whether the Grundy number Γg(G) ≤ 3 is PSPACE- Complete.
