INTRODUCTION
The integration of sensing, memory and computing (IoSMC), is of vital importance to meet the challenges in Internet-of-
Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligent (AI)1-3. Extended gate (EG) ion-sensitive field-effect transistors (ISFETs) lay a solid
foundation for pursuing the development of such highly desired smart biochemical sensor platforms4. That is, by isolating the
transistors from the test environment, EG ISFETs offer whole chip circuit design and system integration for improved sensitivity,
long-term stability and reliability5, 6. Specific detection can be customized by functionalization of the EG. Thanks to the
separation of the sensing environment from the chips, EG ISFETs not only can help mitigate drift, degradation and aging,
suppress noise and ensure stable and reliable sensing response, but also facilitate sensor cleaning and recycling, thus reducing
costs and minimizing environment impact7.
Negative capacitance ferroelectric field-effect transistors (NC FeFETs), are promised to overcome the limitations of

traditional metal-oxide-semiconductor FET (MOSFET), specifically the Boltzmann-defined lowest subthreshold swing, i.e. 60
mV/decade at room temperature8-11. In addition, external electric field triggered polarization switching in ferroelectric materials
can contribute to distinct non-volatile states (“ON” and “OFF” states)12-14, thus opening up new possibilities on IoSMC by
utilizing the gating effect of the ferroelectric polarization field on the charge transport of the semiconducting channel.
Nevertheless, traditional ferroelectric materials suffer from the critical dimension problem, which limits their valuable
ferroelectricity at the nanometer scale and represents an obstacle for improving the transistor performance as well as the
computing and sensing capabilities14-17. Therefore, NC FeFETs based on two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectric ultrathin films
scaled down to several nanometers is highly promising18. Particularly, hafnium zirconium oxide (HfZrOx, HZO) achieved via
complementary MOS (CMOS) compatible atomic layer deposition (ALD) technology19-21, possesses relatively high-κ and large
bandgap and is an innovative candidate for the development of modern FeFETs22-26 and advanced sensors 27-29.
In this work, we propose a highly sensitive and power-efficient ISFET based on a metal-ferroelectric-insulator (MFI) gate
stack. Here, we employed a 6 nm HZO as the ferroelectric layer, along with a 2-nm-thick AlOx buffer layer, to construct an
MFI gate stack on p-type silicon or highly n doped germanium. This design allows to harvest the NC effect and the ferroelectric
memory effect with reduced operation voltage for sensing applications30. We successfully characterized the NC effect,
achieving valuable sub-60 mV/decade SS (the lowest point SS = 40 mV/dec) and the desired ferroelectric loop, in the fabricated
MFI-semiconductor (MFIS) FeFETs. Further ionic sensing measurements are applied on this NC FeFET with EG. Schematic
illustration of the sensing platform and the polarization states originated from different gating effect are shown in Fig.1a and
1b, respectively. In principle, the ferroelectric polarization state in the HZO layer changes according to the polarity of the
applied gate voltage. Furthermore, different sensing environment with charged molecules around the reference electrode can
modulate the applied voltage on the HZO according to the charge detection principle of ISFETs. Therefore, the ferroelectric
polarization will be modulated by the environment. Fig. 1c illustrates a typical transfer curve of NC FeFET with a clockwise
ferroelectric memory window. The device’s ‘OFF’ state exhibits dominant downward polarization. In the presence of charged
molecules including pH, ions, DNAs and proteins, the ‘OFF’ state device can be switched ‘ON’ under the same gate voltage as
represented by the dashed red line interception, due to a potential positive shift of the Vth. Such upward polarization state is
nonvolatile and can be maintained unless it is intentionally erased or programed by applying an external gate voltage that
surpasses the positive coercive reset voltage. Therefore, the presence of charged molecules can be detected and recorded even
if the sensing environment comes back to its original conditions, signifying the potential of FeFETs for smart sensing. At the
end of our study, we find that when the potassium ion concentrations changes from 1 mM to 1 M, it reveals high sensitivity of

62 (±2) mV/decade, which is superior to that of 48 mV/dec of its MOSFET counterparts31, 32. Along with configurable
ferroelectric memory windows, we envision potential development of NC FeFETs towards future IoSMC applications.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

In Fig. 2a, we present the optical image and the cross-section schematic structure of the MFISFET arrays. A sub-10 nm
gate dielectric stack constituted of 2 nm AlOx and 6 nm HZO was adopted on either p-type Si or n-type Ge substrates using an
atomic layer deposition (ALD) tool. Prior to deposition, pure n-type Ge (or p-Si) surface was firstly cleaned with acetone,
methanol and deionized water in an ultrasonic bath for 15min respectively, passivated with 10 cycles Al2O3 and then treated
with O3 atmosphere for 20 minutes to form a 2 nm AlOx layer. Here, AlOx was built up as a gate buffer layer to provide
performance enhancement. Two major restrictions in FeFETs including gate leakage current and charge traps can be better
improved through the AlOx buffer layer12, 33-35. Extra 6 nm high-quality HZO layer with a Zr/Hf ratio of 1:1 was grown on the
AlOx layer by ALD. A TaN layer (100 nm) was deposited by sputtering as the gate electrode. Boron ions (B+) for and

phosphorous ions (P-) were implanted into the source/drain electrode areas for Ge and Si channel transistors, respectively. The
implantation energy was 20 KeV and the dose was 1015 cm2. Ni (20-30 nm) was deposited into the source/drain(S/D) regions
to form the metallic S/D contacts. Finally, the devices were accomplished by a 30 seconds post annealing at 450 ℃. Indeed, in
our prior studies, we have examined orthorhombic phase in HZO36. XRD curves that we have obtained suggests mixed phases
within HZO after undergoing annealing at 450 ℃ for 30 s. This includes the presence of a partial orthorhombic phase. To
confirm the MFIS gate dielectric core structure, cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was made on a
representative device (Fig.2b, comparable MFS structure in Fig. S1). According to the TEM profile image, all interfaces
between every two layers are flat and clear, validating the integrity of the MFIS gate dielectric core structure. While it is
admittedly challenging to identify the orthorhombic phase37 in FFT of the TEM image showcased in Fig. 2b. We are of the
opinion that the analysis via XRD, in conjunction with the electrical P-E measurements, is adequate to ascertain the ferroelectric
properties of HZO.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
Ferroelectric properties embodied in, for example, the ferroelectric P-V hysteresis loop and the NC effect, are of key
importance in the electrical characterizations of NC FeFETs. In our study, we observed a robust ferroelectric polarization
response is from metal-ferroelectric HZO film-metal (MFM) P-V measurement. Fig. 2c depicts the P-V hysteresis loop with a
remnant polarization (Pr) of 25.6 μC/cm2. Fig. S2 demonstrates an additional ferroelectric hysteresis loop of 10 nm HZO with
switching current.
Fig. 3a presents the output curves of a typical NC FeFET device with a 5 µm gate length (LG). Notably, the device exhibits
a negative differential resistance (NDR) effect in the whole subthreshold VDS region ranging from -0.4 V to -2 V (Fig. S3). One
step further, we measured the transfer characteristics and depicted the corresponding SS, as shown in Fig. 3b. Strikingly,
augmented by virtue of the NC effect from HZO ferroelectricity, the commendable FeFET achieves sub-60 mV/decade below

the thermionic limit. That is, Fig. 3b demonstrates 3 data points below the Boltzmann limit in the subthreshold region with the

lowest value of SS =  𝑑𝑉𝐺  = 40 mV/dec, where the potential sensing response will suppress that of conventional MOSFET
𝑑𝑙𝑔𝐼𝐷𝑆

devices. The suppressed gate leakage current due to MFIS structure was present in Fig. S4. We note here that the fluctuations
in SS (Fig. 3b) may be attributed to the switching of the multi-domains in the ferroelectric HZO thin film, as reported in our
previous publications36, 38, 39. Such fluctuations are reproducible to a large extend, as illustrated in Fig. S5a. Similar significant
SS fluctuations and none smooth transfer curves were also observed in NC FinFETs40. To promote further development of
highly sensitive biochemical sensors with low SS value and memory functions, in the follow we exam the synergetic
performance of the ferroelectric memory effect and charge trapping effect in the subthreshold region of NC FeFET devices.
Fig. 3c depicts the dual sweepings of gate voltage (VGS) with various ranges (±2 V to ±4 V), lead to either counter-
clockwise ferroelectric loop or clockwise hysteresis in an n-NC FeFET. Calculated SS values are shown in Fig. S6. Biased at a
sufficiently large VGS sweeping range of ±4 V, initial/remnant polarization can be flipped/switched and the device exhibits a
significant counter-clockwise ferroelectric loop (with a memory window of 1.3 V). We also observed clockwise hysteresis due
to charge trap states if biased at a small VGS sweeping range of ±2 V. Whereas at a moderate VGS sweeping range (±3 V), we
observed a counter-clockwise loop with a relatively small ferroelectric memory window. Such changes in the direction as well
as the width of the memory windows, can be ascribed to an underlying synergetic effect by taking into account both the
ferroelectric polarization effect and the interfacial charge-trapping effect41.

To evaluate the sensing performance of the NC FeFETs, we performed further chemical sensing experiments in aqueous
solutions with various K+ concentrations as testbeds. Fig. S7a depicts the transfer characteristics of the FeFET and the calculated
SS spectra, respectively. It is important to note that the HZO ferroelectric thin film were polarized in Pdown state, as the gate
voltage (from -0.8 V to 0.8 V) were swept within the negative coercive voltage (<-2 V, Fig. 4b, see also the inset of Fig. 3c) of
the HZO ferroelectric thin film. Thanks to the ferroelectricity of the nanoscale ferroelectric HZO thin film, comparably lower
SS (Fig. S7b), as well as amplified voltage gating efficiency due to NC effect can be achieved advantageously42 for ion sensing
with enhanced responsivity and sensitivity. Noted that we operated the FeFET under the same gate step of 20 mV and constant
output source/drain voltage VDS (VDS = 0.1V for n-type FETs and VDS = -0.1V for p-type FETs), to exclude a possible impact of
gate voltage step and source/drain applied voltage on the electrical behaviors43-45. Ag/AgCl reference electrode was adopted as
the extended liquid gate to define the electrostatic potential in a homemade liquid chamber and then connected with the on-
chip gate electrode of NC FeFETs as illustrated in Fig. 1a and S8a. Fig. 4a depicts the drain current (IDS) plotted against the
reference voltage (Vref) in KCl solutions with increased concentrations from 1 mM to 1 M. The NC FeFET sensor yielded a
stable and evident response towards positive Vth. We plotted the deduced threshold voltage shifts against the KCl concentrations
in the inset of Fig. 4a, which exhibited a positive threshold voltage shift of 62 (±2) mV/dec, corresponding to an overall 76
times change in current at Vref = -0.5 V when concentration varies from 1 mM to 1 M. The relative sensing response can be


146
deduced as 𝑆𝐶𝑜𝑛𝐼
= (𝐼𝐶𝑜𝑛𝐼−𝐼𝐶𝑜𝑛,𝑟𝑒𝑓). Repeating the measurements gave stable and reproducible results. In addition, Fig. S8b
𝐼𝐶𝑜𝑛,𝑟𝑒𝑓

illustrates that the calculated SS values here are consistent with those obtained in ambient air conditions. Our observed
potassium sensitivity of 62 mV/dec even slightly exceeds the theoretical value according to the thermodynamic Nernst limit
(60 mV/dec at room temperature). We ascribed the superior sensitivity beyond the Nernst limit to a capacitive effect, which can
be referred to the gate voltage amplification due to ferroelectric NC effect42. Remarkably, unless the baseline MOSFET has
ideal SS at 60 mV/decade limit, it is almost impossible to obtain sub-60 mV/decade SS. Nevertheless, better SS can be obtained
in NC FET over control device no matter whether the SS is steep or not, i.e., the NC effect might not always lead to the sub-
kT/q SS, but must contribute to the improved performance (SS) compared to the baseline device46, 47. When compare its
performance with its counterparts without ferroelectric NC effect (see Fig. S7b), we can clearly identify an improvement in the
SS values, suggesting the effectiveness of the NC effect from HZO.

Furthermore, smart sensing is expected based on the ferroelectric memory effect of the FeFETs. The polarization state of
ferroelectric layer could be modulated by the voltage on the extended gate, as illustrated in Fig.1b. In principle, downward and
upward polarization states of Pdown and Pup occur under respective gate biases separated by the ferroelectric window, resulting

in a low resistance state (LRS) and a high resistance state (HRS), corresponding to logic bits “1” and “0” as indicated by the
arrows in Fig. 4b, respectively. Fig. 4b gives the transfer curves of an n-NC FeFET with a relatively large counter-clockwise
ferroelectric window (1.3 V), tested in ambient air as the background (black line) and against 1 mM K+ solution (blue line) as
the analyte. Here, we conceived that chemical sensing information could be stored by employing ion-modulated polarization
states. The appreciable threshold voltage shift upon introducing 1 mM K+ (270 mV) in Fig. 4b, suggests the possibility of
switching the FeFET sensor from its HRS (Pup state) to LRS (Pdown state) if assuming an initially bias EG voltage of -0.7 V (see
the red line in Fig. 4b). This polarization state persists even when the sensor returns to its ambient background condition because
of the LRS along the reverse transfer curve. A coercive voltage -1.9 V for upward polarization state (erasing operation) is
needed to reprogram information, which is far away from the assumed Vref = -0.7 V. We also note here that the abovementioned
non-volatile sensing can be achieved, without compromising any prospects of the CMOS compatibility and computing
capability of the NC FeFET.

CONCLUSIONS

In summary, our study presents the demonstration of an HZO NC FeFET and its promising applications for sensing
purposes in the form of EG ISFETs. The potassium ion-sensitive FeFETs exhibit a slightly supra-Nernst sensitivity of 62 (±2)
mV/dec towards potassium ions, indicating their potential for highly sensitive ion detection. Furthermore, the incorporation of

a configurable non-volatile ferroelectric memory effect adds valuable memory retention and switching capabilities to the
FeFETs, enhancing their versatility in sensing applications. This opens up exciting possibilities for the future development of
diverse HZO NC FeFET biochemical sensor platforms in IoSMC applications.
