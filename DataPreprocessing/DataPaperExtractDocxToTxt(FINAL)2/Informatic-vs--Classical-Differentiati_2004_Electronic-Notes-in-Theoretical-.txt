Abstract
We study the relationship between informatic and classical differentiation on the real line. The former arises when considering the interval domain over the reals equipped with the Lebesgue measurement. We show that informatic differentiation is a strict generalization of its classical counterpart, and wonder if it can provide a springboard towards extending techniques and results from calculus to certain non classically differentiable functions.
Keywords: Informatic derivative, measurement, domain theory, calculus, interval domain.


Introduction
Informatic differentiation arises in the study of domains and measurements [3]. Given a selfmap on a domain, its informatic derivative measures the rate

at which the content of the output changes with respect to the content of the input. This, for instance, can be used to record how quickly a selfmap converges to a fixed point, and sheds light on whether a fixed point is a local attractor or not. These ideas have been used to study the complexity of algorithms [5] and in the search for fixed points and zeros of functions [4].
When specialized to the interval domain over the reals and continuous real-valued functions, informatic differentiation bears strong similarities with its classical counterpart. In this paper, we make precise and examine some of these similarities, and show that informatic differentiation is a strict general- ization of classical differentiation. One of the most promising consequences of this observation is the possibility to extend certain results from calculus to functions that do not necessarily admit classical derivatives.
Background
We shall be working exclusively with intervals of the real line, so knowledge of domain theory is not required to read this paper. Still, let us hint at the general idea of informatic differentiation (complete details are in [3]): given a
domain and measurement (D, µ), the informatic derivative of f : D → D at p
with respect to µ is

dfµ(p) = lim
x→p
µf (x) − µf (p)
µx − µp

are interested in, D will be the interval domain IR = {[a, b] | a, b ∈ R ∧ a ≤ b} where the limit, if it exists, is taken in the µ topology on D. In the case we length, µ[a, b]= b − a. For p ∈ R we will denote the interval [p, p] by [p]. of compact intervals over the reals, and µ will be the standard measure of Thus, µ[p]= 0.
Now, any continuous map f : R → R has a canonical extension f¯ : IR →
IR. The informatic derivative of f¯ at [p] with respect to µ is then

df¯µ[p] =^
lim
I→[p]
µf¯(I)


µI

where the limit is taken over all non-trivial intervals I ⊃ [p] with µI → 0.
The informatic and classical derivatives of a function are closely related as
the following theorem from [3] shows:
Theorem 2.1 Let f ∈ C(R) and let a, b ∈ R with a < b. Then for p ∈ R,
df¯ [p] ≥ 0 whenever it exists.
If f '(p) exists, then df¯µ[p]= |f '(p)|.
df¯µ[p]= 0 iff f '(p)= 0.

If df¯µ[x] > 0 for all x ∈ (a, b), then f ' exists on (a, b).
f ∈ C1(R) iff df¯µ ∈ C(R).
Proof. (Sketch.) Proofs of (i), (ii), and (iii) can be found in [3]. For (iv),
x ∈ R, then the only value that df¯ [x] can take, if it exists, is zero (cf. one first shows that, whenever f achieves a local extremum at some point Example 2.2). Consequently, if df¯µ[x] > 0 for all x ∈ (a, b), then f is monotone
over (a, b), from which the result easily follows. Lastly, for (v), note that if

df¯
is continuous at p, then f '(p) must exist: either df
µ(p) = 0, in which case

f '(p) = 0, or dfµ(p) > 0, and then by continuity dfµ > 0 on an open interval about p.	 
Example 2.2 The functions f (x) = x and g(x) = −x both have informatic derivative 1 at p = 0. On the other hand, the function h(x) = |x| has no µh¯(I)/µI = 1, whereas when I is of the form [−x, x], the ratio µh¯(I)/µI = informatic derivative at p = 0: indeed, when I is of the form [0, x], the ratio 1/2, which shows that the limit as I → [0] cannot exist.
Defining the Sign of the Informatic Derivative
It may seem strange that df¯µ can capture differentiation without explicit ref- erence to the sign of the derivative. The sign of the derivative, after all, is an important piece of qualitative information. We now show that the existence of an informatic derivative implicitly contains a description of the sign—even if f is not classically differentiable.
Lemma 3.1 Let f ∈ C(R) and p ∈ R be such that df¯µ[p] exists. Then either

lim
e→p+
max f¯([p, e]) − f (p)
e − p
=0	or	(ii) lim
e→p+
min f¯([p, e]) − f (p)
e − p
=0 .

Moreover, df¯µ[p]=0 iff both (i) and (ii) hold, and df¯µ[p] > 0 iff exactly one
of (i) and (ii) holds.
Proof. The only statement that is not immediate is that at least one of (i) and (ii) must always hold. Without loss of generality, it suffices to consider the case p = 0, f (0) = 0, and df¯µ[0] > 0.
For e > 0, let M +(e) = (max f¯([0, e]))/e and m+(e) = (min f¯([0, e]))/e.
Suppose that neither (i) nor (ii) holds. Then there exists q > 0 and two
decreasing sequences ⟨e1, e2,.. .⟩ and ⟨e' , e' ,.. .⟩ of positive reals, both tending
1	2
to zero, such that, for all i, M +(ei) > q and m+(e') < −q. Note that this
entails that df¯µ[0] ≥ q.


trivial interval I ⊆ R containing 0 with µ(I) < δ, |µf¯(I)/µI − df¯µ[0]| < ε. Let ε < q/12 be a positive real number. Find δ such that, for any non- We claim that there exists some 0 < e < δ/2 such that both M +(e) > q/3

and m+(e) < −q/3. To see this, choose i large enough so that ei, e'
< δ/2.

If neither ei nor e' satisfies the condition, the continuous function g(x) =
max f¯([0, x]) + min f¯([0, x]) must change signs between ei and e' . The in-
termediate value theorem therefore yields a value e between ei and e' at
which g vanishes: M +(e) = −m+(e) = (1/2)(µf¯([0, e])/µ[0, e]). Note that µf¯([0, e])/µ[0, e] > df¯µ[0] − ε > 11q/12, and thus M +(e) > 11q/24 > q/3. Likewise, m+(e) < −q/3.
Let M −(e) = (max f¯([−e, 0]))/e and m−(e) = (min f¯([−e, 0]))/e. Notice
would have µf¯([−e, e]) = µf¯([−e, 0]) which would quickly lead to a contra- that we cannot both have M −(e) ≥ M +(e) and m−(e) ≤ m+(e), otherwise we diction on account of the inequalities |µf¯([−e, e])/µ[−e, e] − df¯ [0]| < ε and
|µf¯([−e, 0])/µ[−e, 0] − df¯µ[0]| < ε. Likewise, we cannot both have M +(e) ≥
M −(e) and m+(e) ≤ m−(e). Without loss of generality let us therefore assume
that m−(e) ≤ m+(e) < M −(e) ≤ M +(e).
We now have


µf¯([−e, e]) µ[−e, e]
M +(e) − m−(e)

df¯ [0] + ε − q/6 < df¯ [0] + q/12 − q/6= df¯ [0] − q/12 < df¯ [0] − ε .

In short, we get µf¯([−e, e])/µ[−e, e] < df¯ [0] − ε, contradicting the hypothesis
|µf¯([−e, e])/µ[−e, e] − df¯µ[0]| < ε.	 
There is then an underlying trichotomy at work: either we have exactly
one of (i) and (ii), or df¯ [p] = 0. This implicitly defines a quantity called the
sign of df¯µ at [p], denoted sgn(df¯µ)(p), formally given by

⎧⎪⎨ +1 if only (ii)
sgn(df¯ )(p) =^ ⎪ −1 if only (i)
⎩ 0 otherwise .
The informatic derivative on the real line is a signed quantity in disguise.

Definition 3.2 For f ∈ C(R) and p ∈ R, we deﬁne

dfµ(p) =^ sgn(df¯µ)(p) · df¯µ[p]

to g(x)= f (2p − x), and then show that sgn(dg¯µ)(p)= −sgn(df¯µ)(p).	 Proof. (Sketch.) (i) is immediate. For (ii) and (iii), first apply Lemma 3.1 A classical derivative can thus be factored into two more primitive ideas:
(1) a sign, which gives qualitative information about the shape of the curve
f , and (2) a number df¯, which expresses magnitude of rate of change.
Informatic vs. Classical Differentiability
Despite the close connection between the two notions, we now show that informatic differentiation is strictly more general than classical differentiation.
Let l : [0, 1] → R be l(x) = ln(x + 1). Note that 0 < l(x) < x for all x ∈ (0, 1]. Define a sequence ⟨a1, a2,.. .⟩ as follows: a1 = 1, and ai+1 = l(ai). Lemma 4.1 The sequence ⟨a1, a2,.. .⟩ is strictly decreasing and converges to zero.
Proof. We have l(1) < 1, i.e., a2 < a1. Assuming that an+1 < an, applying l (which is strictly increasing) to both sides yields an+2 = l(an+1) < l(an) = an+1. By induction, the sequence is hence strictly decreasing. Moreover, it is bounded below by 0, and thus has a limit, which by continuity must remain unchanged under l; 0 is the only such point.	 
Next, define a sequence ⟨b1, b2,.. .⟩ by picking bi such that ai+1 < bi < ai. It is clear that the sequences ⟨b1, b2,.. .⟩ and ⟨a1, b1, a2, b2,.. .⟩ are also strictly decreasing, with limit 0.
As a result, we have that any point x ∈ (0, 1] uniquely lies in an interval of the form (bi, ai] or of the form (ai+1, bi]. We can thus define a function

f : [0, 1] → R, as follows: set f (0) = 0, and for any x ∈ (0, 1], if x ∈ (bi, ai], point (bi, 0) to the point (ai, ai) (i.e., f (x)= ai(x − bi)/(ai − bi)); otherwise (if let f (x) be such that the point (x, f (x)) lies on the segment connecting the x ∈ (ai+1, bi]), let f (x) be such that (x, f (x)) lies on the segment connecting
lines y = x and y = 0, we have that 0 ≤ f (x) ≤ x for all x ∈ [0, 1]. (See (ai+1, ai+1) to (bi, 0). Since each of these segments clearly lies between the Figure 1.)
Extend f to [0, ∞) by setting f (x) = 1 for x > 1, and further extend f to the whole of R by setting f (x) = −f (−x) for x < 0. f is plainly everywhere  outside  of  the  set  {±ai, ±bi  | i  ≥  1}∪  {0}. a well-defined continuous function, and is moreover classically differentiable

and (bi, 0) for all i. Since the sets {ai | i ≥ 1} and {bi | i ≥ 1} are dense at 0, Proof. This easily follows from the fact that f takes on the values (ai, ai) the classical derivative cannot exist as it would have to simultaneously take
on the values (among others) of 1 and 0.	 


Lemma 4.3 f is informatically differentiable at x =0 and dfµ(0) = 1.
Proof. Observe first that since f is an odd function, it suffices to consider intervals of the form [0, δ] when computing the limit underlying the informatic derivative.
find the least ai such that δ ≤ ai. We then have ai+1 < δ, so [0, ai+1] ⊂ I, Let therefore I = [0, δ] be a non-trivial interval of length at most 1, and which entails that f¯([0, ai+1]) ⊆ f¯(I), and thus µf¯([0, ai+1]) ≤ µf¯(I). Note
that µf¯([0, ai+1]) = ai+1, since f (ai+1)= ai+1. Combining, we have

l(ai) =
ai
ai+1 ai

the ratio l(ai)/ai = (l(0 + ai) − l(0))/ai tends to l'(0) = 1. Consequently, If we now let δ tend to 0, we get that ai tends to 0 as well, and hence that

df¯µ[0] = lim

We conclude the proof by noting that, clearly, sgn(df¯µ)(0) = 1.	 

function classically differentiable over R − {0}: one would need to ‘smooth’ f We point out that it would be easy, if slightly messy, to convert f into a over each of its cusps. The resulting function would be informatically differ-
entiable over the whole of R, yet still not classically differentiable at zero. We therefore record the following:
Theorem 4.4 In what follows, p, a, and b are real numbers with a < b, and
f is a continuous function from R to R.
There are functions f which admit an informatic derivative at p yet which are not classically differentiable at p.
There are functions f which are informatically differentiable over (a, b) yet which fail to be classically differentiable over an inﬁnite subset of (a, b).
Any function f which is informatically differentiable over (a, b) must be classically differentiable over a dense subset of (a, b).
Proof. (Sketch.) (ii) can be achieved by iterating the construction of f (in- cluding the smoothing-over) over smaller and smaller sub-intervals of (a, b).

For (iii), first note that for any x ∈ (a, b), either df¯
is strictly positive in

some open interval about x, or df¯µ vanishes at points arbitrarily close to x;
in either case, we can invoke Theorem 2.1 to conclude that f ' exists in a set with accumulation point x.	 

Conclusion
We have shown that notions of informatic and classical differentiation are tightly related, yet that the former strictly generalizes the latter. As a con- sequence, it may be possible to extend techniques and results which belong to the classical differential calculus to functions that need not be classically differentiable.
For example, a standard theorem of calculus states that if g(p) = p and

|g'(p)| < 1, then the fixed point p is a local attractor for g. An entirely similar result holds in the informatic world [3,4]. Setting g(x) = α · f (x), where f is the function constructed in the previous section and 0 ≤ α < 1, we are
therefore able to conclude that 0 is a locally attractive fixed point of g, even though g'(0) does not exist. Along the same lines, it may be possible to extend iterative zero-finding techniques such as Newton’s method to functions that need not be classically differentiable.
The work presented in this paper only scratches the surface; it would be very interesting to further investigate the links between informatic and classical differentiation. In particular, it would be most useful to develop a full differential (and integral?) informatic calculus, and perhaps even port some of these ideas back over to the broader context of domain theory.
It may also be very fruitful to contrast the notions of informatic and non- smooth differentiation [2].
