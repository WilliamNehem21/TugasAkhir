Abstract
For every measure µ, the integral I : f '→R f dµ is a linear functional on the set of real measurable functions. By the Daniell-Stone theorem, for every abstract integral ΛR : F → R on a stone vector
lattice F of real functions f :Ω → R there is a measure µ such that	f dµ = Λ(f ) for all f ∈ F .
In this paper we prove a computable version of this theorem.
Keywords: computable analysis, measure theory, Daniell-Stone theorem


Introduction and Mathematical Preliminaries
In this section we summarize some notations, definitions and facts from mea- sure theory and computable analysis.
As a reference to measure theory we use the book [1]. A ring in a set Ω is a set R of subsets of Ω such that ∅ ∈ R and A ∪ B ∈ R and A \ B ∈ R

if A, B ∈ R. A σ-algebra in Ω is a set A of subsets of Ω such that Ω ∈ A,
Ω \ A ∈ A if A ∈ A and  ∞ Ai ∈ A, if A1, A2,... ∈ A. For any system E of
subsets of Ω let A(E) be the smallest σ-algebra in Ω containing E.
A premeasure on a ring R is a function µ : R → R = R ∪ {−∞, ∞} such that µ(∅) = 0, µ(A) ≥ 0 for A ∈ R and

∞	∞
µ(  An) = Σ µ(An)
i=1	i=1
if A1, A2,... ∈ A are pairwise disjoint and  ∞ An ∈ A. A premeasure on an
algebra is called a measure. A premeasure µ on a ring R is called σ-ﬁnite, if there is a sequence A1 ⊆ A2 ⊆ A3 ⊆ ... in R such that A1 ∪ A2 ∪ ... = Ω and µ(Ai) < ∞ for all i.
Theorem 1.1 ([1]) Every σ-ﬁnite premeasure µ on a ring R in Ω has a unique extension to a measure on A(R) which (for convenience) we also denote by µ.
Let (Ω, A, µ) be a measure space. A function f : Ω → R is called mea- surable, if {x | f (x) > a} ∈ A for all a ∈ R. The following condition is equivalent:
(∀a ∈ D) {x | f (x) > a} ∈ A  for some set D dense in R .	(1)
As usual we will abbreviate {f > a} := {x ∈ Ω | f (x) > a}. In (1) the relation “>” can be replaced by “≤”, “≥” or “<”. A function f : Ω → R is
simple, if there are non-negative real numbers a1,... , an and pairwise disjoint
sets A1,... , An ∈ A of finite measure such that f (x) = Σn	aiχA , where χA
i
is the characteristic function of A. For a simple function the integral is defined by

∫	n

aiχAi :=

aiµ(Ai) .	(2)

For functions u, u0, u1,... Ω → R, ui 3 u means: For all x ∈ ω, u0(x) ≤ u1(x) ≤ ... and supi ui(x) = u(x). For a non-negative measurable real func- tion f : Ω → R and b ∈ R, f dµ = b, iff there is some increasing sequence (ui)i∈N of simple functions such that
ui 3 f and  sup ∫ ui dµ = b	(3)
[1]. In particular, f dµ does not exist (in R), if the sequence ( ui dµ)i is unbounded. For an arbitrary real function f : Ω → R let f+ := sup(0,f ) (the positive part of f ) and f− := sup(0, −f ) (the negative part of f ). By


definition, a measurable function f is integrable, if f+ dµ and f− dµ exist and its integral is defined by
∫ f dµ := ∫ f+ dµ − ∫ f− dµ .	(4)

For the following concepts from computable analysis see [4]. Let N :=
{0, 1, 2,.. .} be the set of natural numbers. A partial function from X to Y is denoted by f : ⊆ X → Y , a multifunction by f : ⊆ X ⇒ Y . Let Σ be a sufficiently large finite alphabet such that {0, 1} ⊆ Σ. The set of finite words over Σ is denoted by Σ∗, the set of infinite sequences by Σω. Computability
of functions on Σ∗ and Σω is defined by Turing machines which can read and write finite and infinite sequences, respectively. Standard pairing functions
on Σ∗ are denoted by ⟨ ; ⟩. For w ∈ Σ∗ let ξw : ⊆ Σ∗ → Σ∗ be the word function computed by the Turing machine with canonical code w ∈ Σ∗. Like the “effective G¨odel numbering” φ : N → P (1) of the partial recursive functions the notation ξ satisfies the utm-theorem and the smn-theorem.
Computability on other sets is introduced by using finite or infinite se- quences of symbols as “names”. For the natural numbers let νN : ⊆ Σ∗ → N be the notation by binary numbers and let bni be the binary name of i ∈ N.
Let νQ : ⊆ Σ∗ → Q be some standard notation of the rational numbers. For the real numbers we use the standard Cauchy representation ρ : ⊆ Σω → R,
where ρ(p) = x, iff p encodes a sequence (ai)i of rational numbers such that
|ai−x| ≤ 2−i. For naming systems δi : ⊆ Yi → Mi, Yi ⊆ {Σ∗, Σω} for i = 1, 2, a multifunction f : ⊆ M1 ⇒ M2 is (δ1, δ2)-computable, iff there is a computable function h : ⊆ Y1 → Y2 such that δ2 ◦ h(p) ∈ f (δ1(p)) for all p ∈ dom(δ1) such that f (δ1(p)) /= ∅.
In this article we will consider computability on factorizations of several pseudometric spaces [2]. We generalize the definition of a computable metric space with Cauchy representation from [4] straightforwardly as follows: A
computable pseudometric space is a quadruple M = (M, d, A, α) such that (M, d) is a pseudometric space, A ⊆ M is dense and α : ⊆Σ∗ → A is a notation of A such that dom(α) is recursive and the restriction of the pseudometric d
to A is (α, α, ρ)-computable. (In [4], dom(α) is assumed to be r.e. Notice that for every notation with r.e. domain there is an equivalent one with recursive
domain.) In our applications, M is a linear space and the pseudometric is derived from a seminorm ||.||, d(x, y) = ||x − y||.

The factorization (M, d) of the pseudometric space (M, d) is a metric space defined canonically as follows: x := {y ∈ M | d(x, y) = 0}, M := {x | x ∈ M }, d(x, y) := d(x, y). We define the Cauchy representation δM of the factorization of a computable pseudometric space as follows: δM(p) = x, if p ∈ Σω encodes


a sequence (ai)i (of α-names) of elements of A such that d(ai, x) ≤ 2−i for all

			
i. If M is a linear space with seminorm ||.||, by ax := ax and x + y := x + y the factor space becomes a linear space with norm ||x|| := ||x||. In this case, d(x, y) = ||x − y||.

Computable Measure Spaces
In this section let (Ω, A, µ) be a measure space. For any D ⊆ A let Df :=
{A ∈ D | µ(A) < ∞}. In computable measure theory we want to identify two sets A, B ∈ A, if their symmetric difference A∆B := (A \ B) ∪ (B \ A) has measure 0 and distinguish them otherwise. Since A∆B ⊆ A∆C ∪ C∆B, on the set Af the mapping d : (A, B) '→ µ(A∆B) is a pseudometric.
Lemma 2.1 Let R be a ring such that A(R) = A and µ is a σ-ﬁnite premea- sure on R. Then (Af , d), d : (A, B) '→ µ(A∆B), is a complete pseudometric space with Rf as a dense subset.
Proof: Straightforward.	 

For including sets with infinite measure consider the mapping d∞ : (A, B) '→
µ(A∆B)/(1 + µ(A∆B)) which is a pseudometric on A (notice: ∞/(1 + ∞) = 
Its restriction to Af is equivalent to d. For introducing computability on a pseudometric space we need a countable dense subset [4,3]. Unfortunately,
there are important measure spaces such that the pseudometric space (A, d∞) is not separable.
Example: Consider the measure space (R, B, λ) where B is the set of Borel subsets of the real numbers and λ is the Lebesgue-Borel measure. Let (Ei)i∈N be any countable sequence in B. Define B := i(i; i + 1) \ Ei. Then for all i, λ(B∆Ei) ≥ 1 and hence d∞(B, Ei) ≥ 1/2. Therefore, the set of all Ei cannot be dense. Since this is true for every sequence (Ei)i∈N, the pseudometric space
(B, d∞) is not separable.
We will consider measures which are completions of σ-finite premeasures on countable rings consisting of sets with finite measure. We assume that the operations on the ring and the premeasure are computable.
Definition 2.2 A computable measure space is a quintuple
M = (Ω, A, µ, R, α) such that
A is a σ-algebra in Ω and µ is a measure on it,
R is a countable ring such that A = A(R),
µ(A) < ∞ for all A ∈ R,


the restriction of µ to R is σ-finite,
α : ⊆Σ∗ → R is a notation of R with recursive domain,
(A, B) '→ A ∪ B and (A, B) '→ A \ B are (α, α, α)-computable,
µ is (α, ρ)-computable on R.

R or add the set Ω \
R to R and

Theorem 2.3 Let (Ω, A, µ, R, α) be a computable measure space. Then the quadruple (Af , d, R, α) is a computable complete pseudometric space, where Af = {A ∈ A | µ(A) < ∞} and d(A, B) = µ(A∆B).
Proof: By Lemma 2.1, (Af , d) is a complete pseudometric space with R as a dense subset. By Def. 2.2(v)-(vii) the notation α has recursive domain and
the distance d is (α, α, ρ)-computable.	 

Computability on the computable measure space can be defined via the Cauchy representation of the joined pseudometric space.
Example 2.4 [Lebesgue-Borel measure on R] Let Ω = R, let D ⊆ R be dense in R and let νD : ⊆Σ∗ → D be a notation such that dom(νD) is recursive and ν ≤ ρ. Let I˜D be the set of all intervals [a; b) ⊆ R such that a, b ∈ D and a < b. Let RD be the set of all finite unions of intervals from I˜D and let αD be some notation of RD canonically derived from νD. Then B := A(RD) is the set of Borel-subsets of R. The Lebesgue-Borel measure λ on B is defined uniquely by setting λ([a; b)) := b − a for all a, b ∈ D, a < b [1]. MD := (R, B, λ, RD, αD) is a computable measure space.

Computability on the Integrable Functions
In this section we assume that M = (Ω, A, µ, R, α) is a computable measure space. We introduce a computable pseudometric space for the integrable func- tions. On the set I(M) of µ-integrable functions f : Ω → R a seminorm and a pseudometric are defined by
||f ||M := ∫ |f | dµ,	dM(f, g) := ||f − g||M.	(5)
(see [1]). For introducing computability on I(M) we consider a countable dense set.
Definition 3.1	(i) A function u : Ω → R is a rational step function, iff there are rational numbers a1,... , an and pairwise disjoint sets

A1,... , An ∈ R such that u = Σn	ai · χA .

(ii) Let β : ⊆ Σ∗ → RSF be a canonical notation of the set RSF of rational step functions derived from the notation α such that dom(β) is recursive.
In contrast to a simple function (see Sec. 1), for a rational step function

i=1
ai · χAi
the sets Ai must be in R and the coefficients must be

∫ u dµ = Σn	ai · µ(Ai) and ||u||M = Σn	|ai|· µ(Ai).
Lemma 3.2 For rational step functions u, v and a ∈ Q the functions
(a, u) '→ a · u, (u, v) '→ u + v, u '→ |u|, u '→ inf(u, 1), u '→	u dµ,
(u, v) '→ sup(u, v), (u, v) '→ inf(u, v), u '→ u+, u '→ u−, (u, a) '→
inf(u, a), u '→ ||u||M
are computable w.r.t. the notations β, νQ and ρ.
Proof: Straightforward.	 

In Def. 3.1(i) the condition “A1,... , An are pairwise disjoint” is not re- strictive.
Lemma 3.3 Let β' be a canonical notation of all u = Σn	ai · χA such that
i
ai ∈ Q and Ai ∈ R (but the Ai are not necessarily disjoint). Then β' ≡ β.
Proof: “≤”: From the sets Ai by determining intersections and differences a finite set B1,... , Bm of pairwise disjoint sets can be computed such that each
Ai is a finite union of Bjs. Then coefficinets bj ∈ Q can be computed such

that Σn
ai · χAi
m j=1
bj · χBj . This procedure is computable w.r.t the

representations β, β', α, νQ and νN.
“≥”: Obvious.	 

Theorem 3.4 (I(M), dM, RSF, β) is a computable complete peudometric space.
Proof: By Th. 15.5 in [1], (I(M), dM) is complete.
Consider f ∈ I(M) and ε > 0. Then	f dµ∫=	f+ dµ∫ −	f− dµ. By (3)

dM(f+, u) =  |f+ − u| dµ =  f+ dµ −  u dµ < ε/4. Since Q is dense in R and R is dense in Af by Thm. 2.3, there is a rational step function v such that dM(u, v) < ε/4. We obtain dM(f+, v) ≤ dM(f+, u) + dM(u, v) ≤ ε/2. Correspondingly, there is a rational step function w such that dM(f−, w) ≤ ε/2. We obtain dM(f, v −w) = ||f+ −f− −(v −w)|| ≤ ||f+ −v||+||f−−w|| < ε. Therefore, v − w is a rational step function which is ε-close to f .


On RSF the distance dM is (β, β, ρ)-computable. This follows from Lemma 3.2.


Let δM : ⊆ Σω → I(M)/≡ be the Cauchy representation of the set of equivalence classes of integrable functions (see Sec. 1).

The Computable Daniell-Stone Theorem
For two real-valued functions let (f ∧ g)(x) := inf(f (x), g(x)). A Stone vector lattice of real functions is a vector space F of functions f : Ω → R such that the functions x '→ |f (x)| and x '→ inf(f (x), 1) (denoted by |f | and f ∧1, resp.) are in F if f ∈ F.
Let F+ be the set of non-negative functions in F. Let us call F complete, if f ∈ F whenever ui 3 f for ui ∈ F+ and f : Ω → R.
An abstract integral on a Stone vector lattice F of real functions is a linear functional I : F → R such that for all f, f0, f1,... ∈ F+,
I(f ) ≥ 0  and  I(f ) = I(sup fn) = sup I(fn) if fi 3 f .	(6)
n	n
Let A(F) be the smallest σ-algebra in Ω such that every function f ∈ F 
is measurable.
Theorem 4.1 (Daniell-Stone [1]) Let F be a Stone vector lattice with ab- stract integral I. Then there is a measure µ on A(F) such that f is µ-integrable and I(f ) =  f dµ for all f ∈ F. Furthermore, if there is a sequence (fi)i in F such that (∀x ∈ Ω)(∃i)fi(x) > 0, then the measure µ is uniquely deﬁned.
For a proof see Thms. 39.4 and Cor. 39.6 in [1]. On a Stone vector lattice with abstract integral a seminorm ||.||S and a pseudometric dS can be defined by
||f ||S := I(|f |) and dS (f, g) := ||f − g||S = I(|f − g|) .	(7) For an effective version of Thm. 4.1 we consider a notation γ of a dense subset
D such that (F , dS, D, γ) is a computable pseudometric space. Furthermore, we assume that |f |, f ∧ 1 ∈ D if f ∈ D and that D is closed under rational linear combination.
Definition 4.2 A computable Stone vector lattice with abstract integral is a tuple S = (Ω, F ,I, D, γ) such that
F is a Stone vector lattice with abstract integral I,
D ⊆ F is dense w.r.t the pseudometric dS : (f, g) '→ I(|f − g|),
γ is a notation of D with recursive domain,


if a ∈ Q and f, g ∈ D, then {af, f + g, |f |, f ∧ 1} ⊆ D,
for a ∈ Q and f, g ∈ D, the functions (a, f ) '→ af , (f, g) '→ f +g, f '→ |f |
and f '→ f ∧ 1 are computable w.r.t. νQ, γ and ρ.
the restriction of I to D is (γ, ρ)-computable.
Let δS : ⊆ Σω → F/≡ be the canonical Cauchy representation of the fac- torization of the computable pseudometric space (F , dS, D, γ).
It can be shown easily that (F , dS, D, γ) is a computable pseudometric space. For a computable measure space, the integrable functions with the in-
tegral as linear operator form a computable Stone vector lattice with abstract integral.
Proposition 4.3 Let M = (Ω, A, µ, R, α) be a computable measure space. Then (Ω, I(M), (f '→  f dµ), RSF, β) (see Def. 3.1(ii)) is a computable com- plete Stone vector lattice with abstract integral.
Proof: Straightforward.	 

For two metric spaces (Mi, di) (i = 0, 1) call ψ : M0 → M1 a metric embedding, iff d1(ψ(x), ψ(y)) = d0(x, y) for all x, y ∈ M0. Obviously, a met- ric embedding ψ is injective, i.e., (M0, d0) is, up to renaming, a subspace of
(M1, d1). For computable metric spaces (Mi, di, Ai, αi) (i = 0, 1) with Cauchy representaions δi (i = 0, 1), if ψ : M0 → M1 is a (δ0, δ1)-computable embed- ding, then its inverse ψ−1 : ⊆ M1 → M0 is (δ1, δ0)-computable. In this case, the first space is, up to renaming, a very well behaved subspace of the second
one.
We can now formulate and prove our computational version of the Daniell- Stone theorem. (We use the Cauchy representation δM of a factorized pseudo- metric space of the integrable functions, see Thm. 3.4 and the end of Sec. 3.)
Theorem 4.4 (computable Daniell-Stone) Let S = (Ω, F ,I, D, γ) be a computable Stone vector lattice with abstract integral such that (∀x ∈ Ω)(∃f ∈ D)f (x) > 0. Then there exist a computable measure space M = (Ω, A, µ, R, α) and a funtion ψ such that
ψ is a (δS , δM) computable metric embedding ψ : F /≡ → I(M)/≡;
I(f ) = ∫ g dµ for all f ∈ F and g ∈ ψ(f/≡);
where δS is the Cauchy representation of the factorized pseudometric space derived from S (Def. 4.2) and δM is the Cauchy representation of the factorized pseudometric space derived from M (Thm. 3.4).
For the main proof we need a number of auxiliary propositions. Because


of the space limit their proofs are omitted. First, a ring R on Ω must be defined. Consider f ∈ D. Since f must be µ-integrable by (i) and hence A-measurable, we must have {f > a} ∈ A = A(R) for all a ∈ R. Since
{f > a} =  a<b∈Q{f > b}, it would suffice to require {f > b} ∈ R for all
f ∈ D and b ∈ Q. Unfortunately, some of the values µ({f > b}), b ∈ Q, (which will be defined canonically) might become non-computable. In order to avoid
this problem, for every function f ∈ D+ (the non-negative functions from D) we construct a new countable dense set Cf of computable real numbers (see
(1)) such that µ({f > c}) becomes computable for each c ∈ Cf . R will be the smallest ring containing all the sets {f > c} (f ∈ D+, c ∈ Cf ) for which we define µ{f > c} := sup{I(h) | h ∈ D+, h ≤ χ{f>c} }. Moreover, we define a notation α : ⊆ Σ∗ → R such that (v) - (vii) from Def. 2.2 are satisfied. A further crucial step is to show that for every function f ∈ D+ and every n ∈ N a rational step function t in M = (Ω, A, µ, R, α) with non-negative coefficients can be computed w.r.t. the notations γ, νN and β (from Def. 3.1)
such that t ≤ f and 0 ≤ I(f ) −  t dµ ≤ 2−n .
Define a notation γ+ of D+ := D ∩ F+ by γ+(v) := |γ(v)|. From Def. 4.2 we can conclude that γ+ is reducible to γ (γ+ ≤ γ). Define a notation ν→ of the computable sequences in D+ by
ν→(s) = (f0, f1,.. .) ⇐⇒ (∀w ∈ dom(νN)) fνN(w) = γ+ ◦ ξs(w) ,	(8) that is, iff ξs is a (νN, γ+)-realization of i '→ fi (see Section 1).
As a first step, for each f = γ+(v) ∈ D+ we compute some dense set Dv ⊆ R+ such that µ({f > a}) is a computable real number for all a ∈ Dv (and show how to compute these values).
Proposition 4.5 For every f ∈ D+ and every a0, b0 ∈ Q, 0 < a0 < b0, a real number c and two sequences (gn)n and (hn)n in D+ can be computed w.r.t. the notations γ, νQ, ν→ and ρ such that
a0 < c < b0	(9)
0 ≤ h0 ≤ h1 ≤ ... ≤ χ{f>c} ≤ χ{f≥c} ≤ ... ≤ g1 ≤ g0	(10) sup I(hn) = inf I(gn).	(11)
Notice that for every fixed v ∈ dom(γ) = dom(γ+), the set of constants c,
Dv := {ρ ◦ H0(v, ul, ur) | 0 < νQ(ul) < νQ(ur)} is dense in R+ .	(12) We define the ring and the σ-algebra for the measure space M.
Definition 4.6
R0 := {{γ+(v) > ρ ◦ H0(v, ul, ur)} | v ∈ dom(γ+), 0 < νQ(ul) < νQ(ur)}
R := the smallest ring containing R0 A := A(R) = A(R0)


Notice that R0 is not a ring in general. By Prop. 4.8 for every set A ∈ R0
there are sequences (hi) and (gi) in D+ such that
0 ≤ h0 ≤ h1 ≤ ... ≤ χA ≤ ... ≤ g1 ≤ g0 and  sup I(hn) = inf I(gn) .(13)
In the following we prove that this is true also for all A ∈ R. Additionally we introduce a notation α of R such that the sequences (hi) and (gi) can be computed from A ∈ R.
Proposition 4.7 For functions hn, gn, h' , g' ∈ D+ and A, A' ⊆ Ω let
n	n
0 ≤ h0 ≤ h1 ≤ ... ≤ χA ≤ ... ≤ g1 ≤ g0,

By the next proposition the constructions in Prop. 4.7 are computable. Let us say that t = ⟨s−, s+⟩ encloses a set A ⊆ Ω, if (13) for the sequences (h0, h1,.. .) := ν→(s−) and (g0, g1,.. .) := ν→(s+).
Proposition 4.8 There are computable functions G1 and G2 such that G1(t, t') encloses A ∪ A' and G2(t, t') encloses A \ A', if t encloses A and t' encloses A'.
Proposition 4.9 There is a computable function L such that
ρ ◦ L(⟨s−, s+⟩) = sup I(hn), if ν→(s−) = (hi)i and ν→(s+) = (gi)i such that (13).
Proof: This follows by standard arguments from Def. 4.2(vi).	 (Prop. 4.9)

We define a notation α of R inductively as follows. By Prop. 4.5 there is a computable function H0 such that
c; ρ ◦ −09v, ul, ur)
if f = γ+(v), a0 = νQ(ul) and b0 = νQ(ur). (For convenience we assume dom(γ), dom(νQ) ⊆ (Σ \ Σ')∗ and Σ' ⊆ Σ \ {0, 1} for Σ' := {(, ), ∪, \}.)


α(⟨v, ul, ur⟩) := {γ+(v) > ρ ◦ H0(v, ul, ur)} ∈ R0 ,	(14)
α( (w ∪ w')) := α(w) ∪ α(w') ,	(15)
α( (w \ w')) := α(w) \ α(w')	(16)
for v ∈ dom(γ) = dom(γ+), ul, ur ∈ dom(νQ) such that 0 < νQ(ul) < νQ(ur) and w, w' ∈ dom(α). Let α(x) be undefined for all other x ∈ Σ∗. Then α is a notation of R such that dom(α) is recursive. Obviously, union and difference on R are (α, α, α)-computable.
Thus we have proved (v) and (vi) in Def. 2.2:
Proposition 4.10 α : ⊆ Σ∗ → R is a notation of R with recursive domain and (A, B) '→ A ∪ B and (A, B) '→ A \ B are (α, α, α)-computable,
Next, we define the function µ on A = A(R). For finding a σ-additive measure we apply the non-effective theorem 4.1 since R0 ⊆ F, A(R) ⊆ A(F).
Definition 4.11 Let µ' be the unique measure on A(F) such that f is µ'- integrable and I(f ) = f dµ' for all f ∈ F (Thm. 4.1). Let µ be the restriction of µ' to A(R).
Since A(R) is a σ-algebra, µ is a measure. Therefore, (i), (ii), (v) and (vi) from Def. 2.2 are true. It remains to prove (iii) and (vii). From Prop. 4.7 we
obtain:
Proposition 4.12 For every A ∈ R and sequences (hi) and (gi) in D+ such that (13),  χA dµ = µ(A) = supi I(hi) = infi I(gi). Furthermore, appropri- ate sequences (hi) and (gi) in D+ can be computed from A w.r.t. the notations α and ν→.
Proof: For all i we obt∫ain: I(hi) = ∫ hi dµ' ≤ ∫ χA dµ' ≤ ∫ gi dµ' = I(gi).


Using the functions G1 and G2 from Prop. 4.8 and the function L from Prop. 4.9 we prove that the measure µ is (α, ρ)-computable on R.
Proposition 4.13 The measure µ is (α, ρ)-computable on R, in particular,
µ(A) < ∞ for all A ∈ R.
Thus we have proved Def. 2.2(iii) and (vii). Finally we prove Def. 2.2(iv).
Proposition 4.14 The restriction of µ to R is σ-ﬁnite.
Proof: Since R is countable and µ(A) < ∞ for all A ∈ R, it suffices to show (∀x ∈ Ω)(∃A ∈ R) x ∈ A. Consider x ∈ Ω. By assumption f (x) /= 0 for some f ∈ D. Then |f | = γ+(v) ∈ D+ for some v and |f |(x) > 0. Therefore, there is


some c ∈ Dv (see (12)) such that |f |(x) > c. Therefore, x ∈ {|f | > c} ∈ Y.
 (Prop. 4.14)

Altogether, we have a defined a computable measure space ł = (Ω, A, µ, Y, α). Finally, we consider integration. First, we generalize Prop. 4.12 from char-
acterictic functions χA, A ⊆ Y to rational linear combinations of such func-
tions, i.e., rational step functions. A notation β for the rational step functions
is defined in Def. 3.1.
Proposition 4.15 For every rational step function t with non-negative coef- ﬁcients and every m ∈ N, functions H, G ∈ Ð+ can be computed (w.r.t. β and γ) such that H ≤ t ≤ G and
∫ t dµ — 2−m ≤ I(H) ≤ ∫ t dµ ≤ I(G) ≤ ∫ t dµ + 2−m .

Proof: Straightforward from Prop. 4.12 .	 

Notice that a µ'-integrable function f ∈ J (see Def. 4.11) which is µ- measurable may be not µ-integrable. We prove the converse of Prop. 4.15.
Proposition 4.16 For every function f ∈ Ð+ and every n ∈ N a rational step function t in ł = (Ω, A, µ, Y, α) with non-negative coeﬃcients can be computed w.r.t. the notations γ, νN and β (from Def. 3.1) such that
t ≤ f  and 0 ≤ I(f ) — ∫ t dµ ≤ 2−n .


Let J∗ be the set of all f : Ω → R such that fi 3 f for some sequence of functions in J+.
Define I∗ : J∗ → R by
I∗(f ) := sup I(ui) if ui 3 f . 
i

In [1] p. 189 it is proved that I∗ is well-defined (i.e., supi I(ui) = supi I(vi) if ui 3 f and vi 3 f ) and that I∗ extends I on J+ such that I∗(af ) = aI ∗(f ) (a ≥ 0), I∗(f + g) = I∗(f )+ I∗(g) (f, g, ∈ J∗ ) and I∗(supi fi) = supi I∗(fi) if
fi 3 f in J∗ .
For every A ∈ Y, there is a sequence (hi)i in Ð+ such that hi 3 χA, hence by Prop. 4.12,	χA dµ = µ(A) = I∗(χA), therefore

∫ t dµ = I∗(t) for every non-negative rational step function t.   (17)

Now define the embedding ψ : J /≡ → I(ł)/≡. First, we define ψ(f ) for
f ∈ J+ by a (δS , δM)-realization on names as follows.
Suppose δS (p) = f . Then p encodes (γ-names of) elements fi ∈ Ð+ such I(|f — fi|) ≤ 2−i. By Prop 4.16, for each i a rational step function si can be computed such that 0 ≤ si ≤ fi+2 and 0 ≤ I(fi+2) — si dµ ≤ 2−i−2, and hence
0 ≤ I∗(|fi+2 — si|)
= I∗(fi+2) — I∗(si)
≤ 2−i−2 .
Then for any k > i,
∫ |si — sk|dµ = I∗(|si — sk|)  by (17)
≤ I∗(|si — fi+2|)+ I∗(|fi+2 — f |)
+I∗(|f — fk+2|)+ I∗(|fk+2 — sk|)
≤ 2−i−2 + 2−i−2 + 2−k−2 + 2−k−2
≤ 2−i.
By Thm 15.5 in [1], the sequence (si) of rational step functions converges to some h ∈ I(ł) such that dS(si, h) ≤ 2−i.

Define ψ(f) := h.

We show that ψ is well-defined on J+. Suppose f = g and δS (q) = g. The computation specified above gives a sequence (gi)i of functions in Ð+ and a sequence (ti)i of rational step functions such that
I(|g — gi|) ≤ 2−i, 0 ≤ ti ≤ gi+2 and 0 ≤ I(gi+2) — ∫ ti dµ ≤ 2−i−2 and dS (ti, h') ≤ 2−i for some h' ∈ I(ł). Therefore for all i,
dS(h, h') ≤ dS(h, si)+ dS (si, ti)+ dS (ti, h')
≤ 2−i + ∫ |si — ti| dµ + 2−i
= 2−i+1 + I∗(|si — ti|)
≤ 2−i+1 + I∗(|si — fi+2| + |fi+2 — f |
+|f — g| + |g — gi+2| + |gi+2 — ti|)
≤ 2−i+1 + 2−i−2 + 2−i−2 +0+ 2−i−2 + 2−i−2
≤ 2−i+2 ,


	
and hence, h = h'.
We extend ψ from J+/≡ to J /≡. For f = f+ — f−, (f+, f− ∈ J+), define

ψ(f ) := ψ(f +) — ψ(f −) .
The definition is sound since f+ and f− are uniquely defined.
We show that ψ is norm-preserving. Let f = f+ — f− ∈ J. Let f +, s+, h+
i	i 
and f −, s−, h− be the functions used in the computation of ψ(f +) and ψ(f −),
i	i
respectively. Then
||ψ(f)|| = ||ψ(f +) — ψ(f −)|| = ||h+ — h−|| = I∗(|h+ — h−|) and for all i,

h+ — h− = (h+ — s+)+ (s+ — f +
)+ (f +
— f+)

i	i
+(f+ — f−)
i+2
i+2

+(f− — f − )+ (f −
— s−)+ (s− — h−)

i+2
=: (f+ — f−)+ vi .
i+2	i	i

Then I∗(vi) ≤ 2−i+2. Since in general |I∗(|g|) — I∗(|g + u|)| ≤ I∗(|u|) we can conclude


and therefore,
I∗(|h+ — h−|) — I∗(|f+ — f−|)| ≤ 2−i+2


	
||ψ(f)|| = I∗(|h+ — h−|) = I∗(|f+ — f−|) = I∗(|f |) = ||f || = ||f || .
Similar considerations show that ψ is a linear mapping and that I(f ) = 
gdµ for all f ∈ J and g ∈ ψ(f).
This ends the proof of the computable Daniell-Stone Theorem.
