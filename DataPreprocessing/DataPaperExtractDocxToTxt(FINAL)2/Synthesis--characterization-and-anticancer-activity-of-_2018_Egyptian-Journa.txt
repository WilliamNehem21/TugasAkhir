Vincristine is used to treat different type of cancers. But unwanted side effects limit their applications in medicine. To overcome these side effects by targeted drug delivery approach, we synthesized vincristine loaded folic acid-chitosan conjugated nanoparticles by ionic gelation method. The nanoparticles were characterized using Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy. DLS confirmed small sized nanoparticles (<200 nm) while FTIR confirmed different functional groups associated with synthesized nanoparticles. SEM showed spherical shaped nanoparticles with smooth surface, whereas, TEM con- firmed loading of vincristine in folic acid-chitosan conjugated nanoparticles. Anticancer activity of vin- cristine loaded folic acid-chitosan conjugated nanoparticles was checked by MTT assay on NCI-H460 cells followed by reactive oxygen species level, mitochondrial transmembrane potential and apoptotic morphological changes, which confirmed the cytotoxicity of nanoparticles. Erythrocyte aggregation assay confirmed non-toxicity of nanoparticles. Hence, these nanoparticles can be used to treat NCI-H460 cells.

Introduction

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is major type of lung cancer that bears almost 85% of major lung cancer types. Only 17.3% of the people who develop NSCLC survive for 5 years. NSCLC is an aggres- sive neoplasm, responsible for more lung cancer related deaths every year in the United States than colon, breast, pancreas, and prostate cancers combined together [1]. The major types of NSCLC are – adenocarcinoma (nearly 40%), squamous cell carcinoma (nearly 25–30%) and large cell carcinoma (nearly 10–15%) [2]. Che- motherapy, radiotherapy and surgery have been used to treat NSCLC but have serious side effects. Vincristine is used in clinical practice since the early 1960s [3,4]. Vincristine is used to treat dif- ferent types of cancers, which include acute lymphocytic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, Hodgkin’s disease, neuroblastoma and lung cancer [5]. It is a vinca alkaloid and obtained from the Mada- gascar periwinkle Catharanthus roseus [6]. However, multidrug resistance, unwanted side effects on healthy cells and poor avail- ability to cancer cells limit its utilization in medicine. In a few years, anticancer drugs loaded natural and artificial polymers have

been tested against cancer cell lines to bypass the p-glycoprotein receptors, the main cause of drug resistance.
Among different polymers, chitosan, the cationic polysaccha- ride, has drawn attention in pharmaceutical and biomedical appli- cations due to its bioavailability, mucoadhesivity, biocompatibility, biodegradability, non-toxicity and low-immunogenicity [7–9]. Chi- tosan is composed of (1 ? 4) linked D-glucosamine and N-acetyl-D- glucosamine units obtained by deacetylation of chitin, which is a natural polysaccharide present in the exoskeleton of crustaceans such as crabs and shrimps [7]. Chitosan is thought to be degraded in vertebrates by lysozyme and bacterial enzymes in the colon [10]. These properties make chitosan as an excellent carrier for anticancer drugs. Chitosan nanoparticles can be made target speci- fic to tumor by attaching ligands. The incorporation of targeting ligands with chitosan does not change its physicochemical and bio- chemical properties [11,12]. When compared to other targeting ligands, folic acid is less expensive, can be conjugated to drug delivery carriers easily, and more stable in processing, storage and applications [13]. In this study, vincristine loaded folic acid- chitosan conjugated nanoparticles were synthesized, characterized by different techniques and anticancer activity of nanoparticles was checked against NCI-H460 non-small cell lung cancer cell line.

All the chemicals were of analytical grade. Non-small cell lung can- cer cell line (NCI-H460) was purchased from National Centre for Cell Science (NCCS), Pune, India.

Synthesis of N-hydroxysuccinimide-ester of folic acid

N-hydroxysuccinimide-ester of folic acid was synthesized according to the previously reported method [14]. Prepared 1 M
solution of N-hydroxysuccinimide and N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodii
mide. An amount of 1.5 g of folic acid was dissolved in 25 ml of
hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) and N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and added 2 ml of 1 M N- (DCC). To this solution, added 2 ml of triethylamine and allowed
the reaction to proceed for 17 h under stirring in the dark. Pale yel- low colored dicyclohexylurea was removed through filter paper of 125 mm pore size and washed yellow N-hydroxysuccinimide-ester with 30% acetone solution.

Synthesis of folic acid-chitosan (FA-CS) conjugate

An amount of 45 mg of chitosan was dissolved in 15 ml of acetate buffer (pH 5.6) in a flask with magnetic stirring for a few minutes. Took 200 mg of N-hydroxysuccinimide-ester of folic acid and dissolved in 15 ml of DMSO. Added solution of N-hydroxysuccinimide-ester of folic acid in chitosan solution drop
wise for synthesis of folic acid-chitosan conjugate. The mixture was stirred at 30 °C in the dark for 20 h.

Synthesis of blank and vincristine loaded folic acid-chitosan conjugated (FA–CS) nanoparticles

Blank and vincristine loaded folic acid-chitosan conjugated (FA– CS) nanoparticles were synthesized by ionic gelation method with slight modifications [15]. A stock solution of acetic acid (2%, v/v) and FA-CS solution (0.2%, w/v) was prepared by dissolving 0.2 g of FA-CS conjugate in 100 ml of acetic acid (2%, v/v). The pH of FA-CS solution was adjusted to 5 with 1 N NaOH and HCl. A stock solution of sodium tripolyphosphate (TPP) (0.5%, w/v) was pre- pared by dissolving 250 mg in 50 ml double distilled water. Also prepared a stock solution of vincristine in water (1 mg/10 ml, pH 4.77). For synthesis of blank folic acid-chitosan conjugated nanoparticles, added 25 ml of folic acid-chitosan conjugate solu- tion in a flask and then added 5 ml sodium tripolyphosphate to it drop wise to make 1:5 ratio till the formation of nanoparticles sus- pension and allowed to stir for 30 minutes on a magnetic stirrer at room temperature. For the synthesis of vincristine loaded nanopar- ticles, took constant volume (25 ml) of folic acid-chitosan conju- gate predissolved in acetic acid in four separate flasks, added
varying volumes of stock solutions of vincristine (100 ml, 200 ml, 300 ml, 400 ml) in these flasks and then added sodium tripolyphos- phate (5 ml) in each flask drop wise. The solution was allowed to
stir for 30 minutes on a magnetic stirrer at room temperature. The synthesized vincristine loaded folic acid-chitosan conjugated nanoparticles were labeled as 1:25, 2:25, 3:25 and 4:25 formula- tions, respectively. Nanoparticles suspension of blank and vin- cristine loaded folic acid-chitosan conjugated nanoparticles was centrifuged at 16,000 rpm for 30 minutes to separate nanoparticles from solution for further characterization.

Characterization

Average size, polydispersity index and zeta potential
Average size, polydispersity index and zeta potential of nanoparticles were measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS) using Malvern Zetasizer Nanos ZS90 (Malvern Instruments, UK).
The nanoparticles (50 ml) were dispersed in double distilled water (950 ml) to make 1 ml solution and readings were taken at 25 °C. Three different batches were analyzed to give an average value
and standard deviation for the average size, polydispersity index and zeta potential.

Encapsulation efficiency (%) and loading capacity (%)
The encapsulation efficiency (%) and loading capacity (%) of vin- cristine loaded folic acid-chitosan conjugated nanoparticles were determined by centrifuging samples at 16,000 rpm for 30 minutes. The contents of free vincristine in the supernatant was determined by UV spectrophotometer (NanoDrop 2000c, Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA) at 220 nm wavelength using supernatant of their corresponding blank nanoparticles as basic correction. The encapsulation efficiency (%) and loading capacity (%) were cal- culated by following equations:
Encapsulation efficiency (%)
= (Vincristine)tot — (Vincristine)free/(Vincristine)tot × 100  (1)
Loading capacity (% w/w)
= Mass of vincristine in chitosan nanoparticles
/Mass of chitosan nanoparticles recovered × 100	(2)
Storage stability of nanoparticles
Storage stability of blank and vincristine loaded folic acid- chitosan conjugated nanoparticles was measured in sodium phos- phate buffer (pH 7.4) at 4 °C in a refrigerator. The average size, poly- dispersity index and zeta potential were measured with dynamic light scattering (DLS) after 10 days using Malvern Zetasizer Nanos ZS90 (Malvern Instruments, UK). The nanoparticles (50 ml) were dispersed in double distilled water (950 ml) to make 1 ml solution
and readings were taken at 25 °C. Experiment was performed in
triplicates. Average value and standard deviation for the average size, polydispersity index and zeta potential were measured.

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)
The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of blank and vin- cristine loaded chitosan nanoparticles were analyzed by Spectrum RX-IFTIR spectrometer (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA). Dried nanoparticles were mixed with potassium bromide (KBr) in 2% w/w ratio. The mixture was ground into fine powder and com- pressed into potassium bromide disc under a hydraulic press at 10,000 psi. Each potassium bromide disc was scanned over a wave
number region from 4000 cm—1 to 400 cm—1 with resolution of 1 cm—1. Characteristic peaks of functional groups for different sam- ples were recorded.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
The morphology of blank and vincristine loaded chitosan nanoparticles were analyzed by scanning electron microscope



(JEOL Model JSM – 6390LV). For this, a small quantity of samples were placed in aluminum stubs and then coated with platinum. The SEM images were taken under accelerated electrons with volt- age of 15 kV.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
Loading of vincristine in folic acid-chitosan conjugated nanoparticles was examined by transmission electron microscope (Jeol/JEM 2100, Peabody, MA, USA). A drop of nanoparticles was dried on copper grid and TEM images were taken at operating volt- age of 200 kV.

In vitro release study
In vitro release study of vincristine loaded folic acid-chitosan conjugated nanoparticles were analyzed by dialysis tubing (molec- ular weight cut off between 12,000–14,000 Da) in phosphate buffered saline (pH 6.7) at 37 °C [14]. Vincristine loaded nanopar- ticles (10 mg) were dispersed in 1 ml of phosphate buffered saline and placed in dialysis tube. This tube was immersed in 50 ml phos- phate buffered saline and shaken at 105 rpm at 37 °C. At definite interval of time, release media were collected and replaced with fresh phosphate buffered saline. The concentration of the released vincristine into phosphate buffered saline was determined at 220 nm wavelength with UV–Vis spectrophotometer (NanoDrop 2000c, Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA).

Analysis of vincristine uptake by fluorescence microscopy
The cellular uptake of vincristine loaded folic acid-chitosan con- jugated nanoparticles in NCI-H460 cells was analyzed by fluores- cence microscopy. Cells were incubated with 100 ml of Hoechst
33258 dye (0.5 lg/ml, blue fluorescence) at 37 °C for 1 h in a CO2
incubator and washed twice with PBS (pH 7.4) by centrifuging at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes (Velocity 18 R, Refrigerated centrifuge, Dynamica, United Kingdom). The washed cells were resuspended in RPMI-1640 medium and incubated with 100 ml of vincristine
loaded folic acid-chitosan conjugated nanoparticles (10 mg/ml,
4:25 formulation) at 37 °C for 45 minutes. Cells were then exam-
40× magnification (Nikon TiS Eclipse fluorescence Microscope, ined under a fluorescence microscope using blue fluorescence at Tokyo, Japan).

Anticancer activity of vincristine loaded folic acid-chitosan conjugated nanoparticles
Cell culture. The research work on non-small cell lung can- cer cell line (NCI-H460) was carried out at Department of Animal Biotechnology, Lala Lajpat Rai University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Hisar. NCI-H460 cells were purchased from National Cen- tre for Cell Science (NCCS), Pune, India. Cells were cultured as a monolayer on RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM L-Glutamine, 4.5 g glucose per litre and
1.5 g per litre sodium bicarbonate without HEPES buffer, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin and streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were grown in 75 cm2 tissue culture flasks and used for experiments when in exponential growth phase.

MTT assay. The cytotoxicity of vincristine loaded folic acid- chitosan conjugated nanoparticles was determined by method of
Mosmann [16] with slight modifications. The cells (1 ml, 1 × 106
cells/ml) were cultured in a 96 well plate and treated with different
concentrations of blank and vincristine loaded folic acid-chitosan conjugated nanoparticles (5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 mg/ml dissolved in phosphate buffered saline) of 4:25 formulation. The cells were incubated with 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 16 h in a CO2 incu- bator. Cells in PBS (pH 7.4) with RPMI-1640 medium and RPMI- 1640 medium alone were used as negative control. Added 10 ll
stock MTT dye solution (5 mg/ml) to each well and incubated the plate at 37 °C for 2 h. The medium was removed with the help of a micropipette carefully without disrupting the cells and added 100 ml of anhydrous isopropanol (0.1 N HCl) in each well. The cells
were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h with 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C.
Spectrophotometric readings of each well were taken at 570 nm with Synergy 2 Multi-Mode Reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT, US). IC50 values were calculated and the optimum dose was used for further study. The percent cell viability was calculated by following equation:
Cell viability(%)= O.D. of cells treated with nanoparticles
/O.D. of control cells × 100	(3)
The NCI-H460 cells were divided into four experimental groups.
Group 1: untreated control cells in RPMI-1640 medium, Group 2: untreated control cells in PBS (pH 7.4) with RPMI-1640 medium, Group 3: blank folic acid-chitosan conjugated nanoparticles (10 mg/ml), Group 4: vincristine loaded folic acid-chitosan conjugated nanoparticles (5 mg/ml).

Determination of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level. The intracellular ROS level was measured using a non-
fluorescent probe, 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA),
in the living cells [17]. The NCI-H460 cells (1 ml, 1 × 106 cells/ which is oxidized by ROS to fluorescent dichlorofluorescein (DCF) ml) were cultured in a 96 well plate with 95% air and 5% CO2 at
37 °C in a CO2 incubator. Cells were treated with blank (50 ml, 10 mg/ml in PBS) and vincristine loaded folic acid-chitosan conju- gated nanoparticles (50 ml, 5 mg/ml in PBS). Untreated cells in RPMI-1640 medium and PBS (pH 7.4 + cells + RPMI- 1640 medium) were used as negative control. The cells were incubated with 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 16 h. Added 50 ml
of 10 lM 2' ,7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate stock solution prepared
in DMSO, to each well and allowed to incubate at 37 °C for 30 min-
utes in a CO2 incubator. The cells were washed with RPMI-1640 medium and observed under blue fluorescence using a fluores- cence microscope (Nikon TiS Eclipse, Tokyo, Japan).

Determination of changes in mitochondrial transmembrane potential. The changes in mitochondrial transmembrane mem- brane potential in NCI-H460 cells treated with blank and vin- cristine loaded folic acid-chitosan conjugated nanoparticles were analyzed using Rhodamine-123 staining with slight modifications
[17]. The NCI-H460 cells (1 ml, 1 × 106 cells/ml) were cultured in
a 96 well plate with 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator,
and then treated with blank (50 ml, 10 mg/ml in PBS) and vincristine loaded folic acid-chitosan conjugated nanoparticles (50 ml, 5 mg/ml in PBS). Cells with RPMI-1640 medium and PBS (pH 7.4 + cells + RPMI-1640 medium) were used as negative con-
trol and incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. Prepared a stock solution of
Rhodamine (5 mmol/L) and added 50 ml in each well followed by incubation for 30 minutes in a CO2 incubator. Cells were washed with RPMI-1640 medium and observed under blue fluorescence using a fluorescence microscope (Nikon TiS Eclipse, Tokyo, Japan).

Determination of apoptotic morphological changes. Acridine orange (AO) and ethidium bromide (EtBr) dual staining method was adopted to differentiate condensed apoptotic nuclei from nor-
mal cells [17]. The NCI-H460 cells (1 ml, 1 × 106 cells/ml) were cul-
tured in a 96 well plate with 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C in CO2
incubator. Cells were treated with blank (50 ml, 10 mg/ml in PBS) and vincristine loaded folic acid-chitosan conjugated nanoparticles (50 ml, 5 mg/ml in PBS). Cells with RPMI-1640 medium and PBS (pH 7.4 + cells + RPMI-1640 medium) were used as negative control
and incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. Prepared stock solutions of acri-



dine orange and ethidium bromide (1 mg/ml) in PBS (pH 7.4). Cells were incubated with 5 ml each of acridine orange and ethidium
bromide in each well at 37 °C for 30 minutes. Cells were washed
with RPMI-1640 medium and observed under blue fluorescence using a fluorescence microscope (Nikon TiS Eclipse, Tokyo, Japan).

Erythrocyte aggregation assay. Aggregation assay was per- formed to check the toxic effect of nanoparticles on erythrocytes [17]. Since encapsulation efficiency (%) and loading capacity (%) of 4:25 formulation was maximum, hence selected for assay. Human blood was collected in a sterile tube containing ethylenedi-
aminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). About 500 ml blood was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 30 minutes to separate erythrocytes. Cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) twice and stored in the same buffer. To check the toxic effect of vincristine
loaded folic acid-chitosan conjugated nanoparticles, 100 ml of ery- throcytes were treated with 400 ml of nanoparticles dissolved in phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.4) and incubated for 1 h at 37
°C. Erythrocytes were observed at 40× magnification under a com-
pound microscope (Magnus Analytics, New Delhi).

Results and discussion

Synthesis of N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of folic acid and folic acid–chitosan conjugate
Folic acid on reaction with N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS), N,N'- dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) and triethylamine resulted in the
formation of dark pale yellow colored dicyclohexylurea, confirm- ing the synthesis of N-hydroxysuccinimide-ester of folic acid. Ear- lier, Salar and Kumar [14] observed yellow colored dicyclohexylurea while synthesizing vincristine loaded folic acid- chitosan conjugated nanoparticles at pH 2.5. Similarly, Ji et al.
[18] also observed N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of folic acid during preparation of methotrexate loaded folic acid conjugated O-carboxymethyl chitosan nanoparticles. Further, folic acid- chitosan conjugate, dissolved in acetate buffer (pH 5.6) reacted with N-hydroxysuccinimide-ester of folic acid to form folic acid- chitosan conjugate. Similarly, Wang et al. [19] synthesized folic acid-chitosan conjugate, while loading mitoxantrone into folic acid-chitosan conjugated nanoparticles. Naghibi Beidokhti et al.
[20] synthesized folic acid-chitosan conjugate by reaction of N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of folic acid with chitosan.

Blank and vincristine loaded folic acid-chitosan conjugated nanoparticles

The folic acid-chitosan conjugated nanoparticles were formed due to the ionic interaction between positively charged amino group (-NH+) of the folic acid-chitosan conjugate and negatively charged sodium tripolyphosphate [18]. Folic acid-chitosan dis- solved in acetic acid on reaction with sodium tripolyphosphate and different concentrations of vincristine, resulted in the forma- tion of vincristine loaded folic acid-chitosan conjugated nanoparti- cles in different formulations. In earlier reports, Methotrexate loaded chitosan nanoparticles have been prepared by the ionic gelation method and tested against LNCaP prostate cancer cell line in vitro [21].

Characterization

Average size, polydispersity index and zeta potential
Average size of blank folic acid-chitosan conjugated nanoparti- cles was found to be 95.59 ± 0.52 nm with polydispersity index of
0.229 ± 0.31 and zeta potential of +8.91 ± 0.36 mV (Table 1). When
vincristine was loaded in nanoparticles, a concentration dependant increase in the average size (nm) and zeta potential (mV) observed from 1:25 to 4:25 formulations. For formulation with maximum quantity of vincristine (4:25), average size of vincristine loaded folic acid-chitosan conjugated nanoparticles was 130.0 ± 0.89 nm with polydispersity index of 0.221 ± 0.01 and zeta potential of
+9.83 ± 1.41 mV (Fig. 1). It has been reported that due to enhanced permeability effect, nanoparticles with size smaller than 200 nm can generally increase accumulation of anticancer drug in tumor [22]. Moreover, nanoparticles less than 200 nm have significantly longer circulation time because of low uptake by the reticuloen- dothelial system [23]. Vincristine loaded folic acid-chitosan conju- gated nanoparticles in all formulations were below 200 nm in size, hence can be used for delivery against cancer cells. The positive zeta potential of all formulations favors uptake of nanoparticles by negatively charged cancer cells. In previous study, Salar and Kumar [14] observed large values of average size, polydispersity index and zeta potential of vincristine loaded folic acid – chitosan conjugated nanoparticles at pH 2.5 for same formulations. This showed that the pH of folic acid-chitosan conjugate solution dis- solved in acetic acid prior to synthesis of nanoparticles has a con- trolling effect on average size, polydispersity index and zeta potential.

Encapsulation efficiency (%) and loading capacity (%)
Encapsulation efficiency (%) and loading capacity (%) of all for- mulations is shown in Table 2. A concentration dependant increase in the encapsulation efficiency (%) and loading capacity (%) of vin- cristine loaded folic acid-chitosan conjugated nanoparticles was observed with maximum for 4:25 formulation i.e. 95 ± 0.35 and
48.65 ± 0.47, respectively. These efficiencies were found higher as compared to vincristine loaded folic acid-chitosan conjugated nanoparticles synthesized at pH 2.5 by Salar and Kumar [14]. This showed that pH has effect on controlling the encapsulation effi- ciency (%) and loading capacity (%) of carrier system for anticancer drug. Earlier, Sun et al. [24] synthesized 5-fluorouracil loaded chi- tosan nanoparticles and observed maximum encapsulation effi- ciency and loading capacity of 44.28 ± 1.69% and 20.13 ± 0.007%, respectively when mass ratio of 5-fluorouracil and chitosan was 1:1. Xu et al. [25] reported encapsulation efficiency (85.4 ± 4.9%) and loading capacity (3.91 ± 0.12%) of gemcitabine in folic acid- chitosan conjugated nanoparticles.

Storage stability of nanoparticles
As shown in Table 3, there was increase in average size for all formulations after 10 days stored in sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and found maximum for 2:25 formulation i.e. 341.1 ±
0.58 nm. An increase in the polydispersity index was also observed, except 1:25 formulation. However, a decrease in the zeta potential was found in all formulations, except 3:25, but still was positive. Overall, there were variations in average size, polydispersity index and zeta potential, but was not significant. So it can be concluded that sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) was suitable medium for storage of blank and vincristine loaded folic acid-chitosan conju-

pared with dynamic light scattering (DLS) due to different tech-



niques used for preparation of nanoparticles for analysis. The nanoparticles in 4:25 formulation looked more rough in appear- ance, which might be due to maximum loading of vincristine in these. In contrast, Panwar et al. [28] observed smooth and spheri- cal shaped ferulic acid-loaded chitosan nanoparticles and checked anticancer activity against ME-180 human cervical cancer cell lines. They observed significant inhibition in ME-180 cells and con-
cluded that these nanoparticles can be used to treat cervical can- cer. Anitha et al. [29] also observed spherical morphology of curcumin-loaded N,O-carboxymethyl chitosan nanoparticles and checked anticancer activity against normal (L929) and breast can- cer cell line (MCF-7). The authors reported non-toxicity of nanoparticles against L929 cells, whereas enhanced toxicity was found against MCF-7 cells. In another report, Mehrotra et al. [30]

observed spherical shaped and smooth surfaced lomustine loaded chitosan sodium tripolyphosphate and chitosan-sodium hexam- etaphosphate nanoparticles.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
As shown in Fig. 4, blank and vincristine loaded FA-CS nanopar- ticles were spherical in shape. As compared to blank FA-CS nanoparticles, granule like structures were present in nanoparti- cles of 1:25, 2:25, 3:25 and 4:25 formulations due to loading of vincristine. However, there were difference in the size of nanopar- ticles as compared with SEM due to more dilutions of sample used for preparation of nanoparticles for analysis in TEM. Earlier, Salar and Kumar [14] observed spherical shaped vincristine loaded folic acid-chitosan conjugated nanoparticles with granule like structure due to loading of vincristine. Similarly, spherical shaped mitox- antrone loaded folic acid-chitosan conjugated nanoparticles has also been observed [19].

In vitro release study
As shown in Fig. 5, 1:25 formulation showed 16.67% cumulative release of vincristine within 2 h and subsequently 16.71, 33.33 and 33.37% after 4, 6 and 8 h, respectively. As compared to this, 2:25
formulation showed 16.31% release within 2 h and 16.67, 16.71,
27.33% release after 4, 6 and 8 h, respectively. Similarly, a formu-
lation of 3:25 showed 6.25% release within 2 h and after 4, 6, 8 h
release was 6.07, 6.09, 12.5%, respectively. Finally, 4:25 formula-
tion showed 5.51% release of vincristine within 2 h and subse- quent release was 5.47, 5.57, 11.11% after 4, 6, 8 h, respectively from folic acid-chitosan conjugated nanoparticles. It can be con- cluded that, except 1:25, all formulations showed slow and sus- tained release of vincristine. Similarly, Wang et al. [19] observed slow release of mitoxantrone loaded in folic acid-chitosan conju- gated nanoparticles in artificial gastric liquid (pH 1.2) and intesti- nal fluid (pH 6.8).

Uptake of vincristine loaded FA-CS nanoparticles by NCI-H460 cells
Visual evidence of vincristine loaded folic acid-chitosan nanoparticles (4:25) uptake by the NCI-H460 cells during 45 min- utes incubation time at 37 °C was analyzed by fluorescence micro- scopy using Hoechst 33258 dye. NCI-H460 cells showed diminished fluorescence when grown in RPMI-1640 medium.
However, when cells were treated with vincristine loaded folic acid-chitosan conjugated nanoparticles (100 ml), brighter fluores-
cence was observed at 40× magnifications due to uptake of
nanoparticles (Fig. 6). Since, Hoechst 33258 is a blue fluorescent
dye used to stain DNA of cells, the fluorescence was observed due to uptake of nanoparticles by cells and their action on DNA. Similarly, Karthikeyan et al. [17] also observed brighter blue fluo- rescence in NCI-H460 non-small cell lung cancer cells treated with resveratrol loaded gelatin nanoparticles than free resveratrol using Hoechst 33258 dye during 30 minutes incubation time.



Anticancer activity of vincristine loaded FA-CS nanoparticles
Table 4 shows the percent cytotoxicity of blank and vincristine loaded folic acid-chitosan conjugated nanoparticles (5, 10, 15, 20, 25 mg/ml) in NCI-H460 cells. For blank nanoparticles, the lowest cell viability (40.25%) was observed at 20 mg/ml concentration. In comparison, vincristine loaded FA-CS nanoparticles showed lowest cell viability (32.78%) at 10 mg/ml concentration. Hence the inhibitory concentration 50 (IC50) was fixed as 10 mg/ml for blank and 5 mg/ml for vincristine loaded folic acid-chitosan conjugated nanoparticles because at these concentrations, the NCI-H460 non-small cell lung cancer cell line can be used to check intracellular ROS level, changes in mitochondrial transmembrane potential and apoptotic morphological changes without causing damage to cells. For group 1: untreated control cells in RPMI- 1640 medium and group 2: untreated control cells in PBS (pH
7.4) with RPMI-1640 medium, almost 100% cell viability was observed, hence not included in the table. Similarly, Wang et al.
[31] determined the cytotoxicity of free 5-fluorouracil and 5- fluorouracil loaded hyaluronic acid coated chitosan nanoparticles of different concentrations against A549 cells and HepG2 cells. The results showed that the naked hyaluronic acid-coated chitosan nanoparticles at a concentration (ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 mg/mL) did not inhibit the proliferation of A549 and HepG2 cells, and viability ratios were over 85%. Compared with 5- fluorouracil and 5-fluorouracil-loaded uncoated chitosan nanopar- ticles, 5-fluorouracil-loaded hyaluronic acid-coated chitosan nanoparticles showed higher cytotoxicity in A549 and HepG2 cells, which was 50% maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) at
8.0 and 6.7 lg/mL at 48 h, respectively. The cytotoxic effect of hyaluronic acid-coated chitosan nanoparticles was reduced to

13.1 lg/mL at 48 h against A549 cells whereas, addition of free hyaluronic acid had no obvious effects on the HepG2 cells. Anitha et al. [29] studied in vitro cytotoxicity of curcumin and curcumin- N,O-carboxymethyl chitosan nanoparticles in a normal (L929), human breast cancer (MCF-7) and prostate cancer cell line (PC- 3). L929 cell line treated with N,O-carboxymethyl chitosan nanoparticles showed high cell viability within concentration range of 1–5 mg/ml, whereas reduced cell viability was observed with curcumin and curcumin loaded N,O-carboxymethyl chitosan nanoparticles in the same concentration. However, 80% of the cell viability indicated the non-toxicity of curcumin, N,O- carboxymethyl chitosan nanoparticles and curcumin loaded N,O- carboxymethyl chitosan nanoparticles towards normal cells. For MCF-7 cells, N,O-carboxymethyl chitosan nanoparticles showed no toxicity, whereas curcumin and curcumin N,O-carboxymethyl nanoparticles showed considerable toxicity. Similarly, in PC-
3 cells, curcumin-N,O-carboxymethyl chitosan nanoparticles showed toxicity, as a result of which cell viability was reduced to 30% at 5 mg/ml concentration, confirmed its anticancer effects.

Determination of intracellular ROS level
As shown in (Fig. 7i), weak ROS generation was observed in the untreated NCI-H460 cells. In contrast, blank nanoparticles showed significant ROS production and a further enhanced ROS generation, was found in vincristine loaded folic acid-chitosan conjugated nanoparticles (Fig. 7i). Similarly, Hou et al. [32] observed ROS level in human lung carcinoma (A549) and cervical cancer cell line (HeLa) treated with triphenyl phosphine-functionalized chitosan nanoparticles through targeted delivery of doxorubicin to mito- chondria. The results demonstrated that ROS levels in A549 and HeLa cells exposed to free doxorubicin showed a certain enhance- ment and were increased to 120.5% in 24 h and 130.4% after 48 h in

A549 cells in comparison with 130.4% in 24 h and 136.7% after 48 h in HeLa cells. In the same way, doxorubicin-loaded triphenyl phosphine-functionalized chitosan nanoparticles also triggered ROS levels at 168.4% in 24 h and 180.4% after 48 h in A549 cells, and 150.1% in 24 h and 166.5% after 48 h in HeLa cells.

Determination of changes in mitochondrial transmembrane potential
NCI-H460 cells treated with blank FA-CS nanoparticles and untreated control cells (Fig. 7ii) showed blue fluorescence due to accumulation of Rh-123 dye. However, no Rh-123 accumulation

was found in vincristine loaded folic acid-chitosan conjugated nanoparticles treated cells (Fig. 7ii). Hence, mitochondrial mem- brane potential has been found to be reduced in the cells treated with vincristine loaded FA-CS nanoparticles. Karthikeyan et al.
[17] observed reduced mitochondrial membrane potential in NCI-H460 cells treated with resveratrol-loaded gelatin nanoparti- cles as compared to resveratrol. They found accumulation of Rh- 123 dye in the control group whereas, resveratrol-loaded gelatin nanoparticles treated cells showed decreased membrane potential.

Determination of apoptotic morphological changes
Very less morphological changes associated with acridine orange and ethidium bromide were observed in control and NCI- H460 cells treated with blank FA-CS nanoparticles (Fig. 7iii). When NCI-H460 cells were treated with vincristine loaded folic acid-
chitosan conjugated nanoparticles (5 mg/ml, 50 ml), apoptotic fea-

acid chitosan conjugated nanoparticles were more effective than blank nanoparticles. Finally, vincristine loaded folic acid-chitosan conjugated nanoparticles showed 75% of apoptotic cells, whereas for blank 31% cells were observed with apoptosis. Karthikeyan et al.

mented chromatin, indicative of apoptosis in resveratrol and resveratrol-loaded gelatin nanoparticles treated NCI-H460 cells. Resveratrol-loaded gelatin nanoparticles treated NCI-H460 cells showed 98% apoptosis, whereas free resveratrol treatment showed only 42% apoptotic cells. Similarly, Panwar et al. [28] determined apoptotic morphological changes of ferulic acid-loaded chitosan nanoparticles against human cervical cancer cell line (ME-180) with acridine orange (AO) and ethidiumbromide (EtBr) staining. Cells treated with ferulic acid chitosan-tripolyphosphate penta- sodium nanoparticles (40 mM) for 24 h displayed morphological
characteristics such as higher cell shrinkage, cytoplasmic conden-
sation, and irregularity in shape, suggested that ferulic acid- loaded chitosan nanoparticles could induce apoptotic cell death in ME-180 cells. The morphology and growth of cancer cells cul- tured on unloaded chitosan-tripolyphosphate pentasodium nanoparticles were negligibly affected as compared to control.

Erythrocyte aggregation assay

As shown in Fig. 8(a), fresh erythrocytes were spherical in shape. After treatment with vincristine loaded folic acid-chitosan conjugated nanoparticles (400 ml, 4:25 formulation) in phosphate
buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) for 1 h at 37 °C, no aggregation of ery-
throcytes was reported as shown in Fig. 8(b). This showed that 4:25 formulation was safe for erythrocytes. Similarly, Karthikeyan et al. [17] also observed no aggregation of erythrocytes when trea- ted with resveratrol-loaded gelatin nanoparticles.

Conclusion

In this study, vincristine was loaded in folic acid-chitosan con- jugated nanoparticles in different formulations i.e. 1:25, 2:25, 3:25, 4:25 at pH 5. Maximum encapsulation efficiency (%) and loading capacity (%) was observed for 4:25 formulation i.e. 95 ± 0.35 and
48.65 ± 0.47, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy showed spherical structure with rough surfaced nanoparticles. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmed encapsulation of vincristine in nanoparticles. Attachment of folic acid, size of nanoparticles below 200 nm in all formulations with positive zeta potential favored tar- geted delivery of vincristine to cancer cells. Anticancer activity of vincristine loaded folic acid chitosan nanoparticles in 4:25 formu- lation was checked against non-small cell lung cancer cell line (NCI-H460). MTT assay showed greater cytotoxicity of vincristine loaded folic acid chitosan conjugated nanoparticles as compared to blank. Enhanced ROS generation, decreased mitochondrial transmembrane potential and apoptotic morphological changes associated with NCI-H460 cells showed effectiveness of vincristine loaded folic acid-chitosan conjugated nanoparticles in the treat- ment of NCI-H460 cells. No aggregation of erythrocytes was reported when treated with vincristine loaded folic acid-chitosan conjugated nanoparticles. Hence vincristine loaded folic acid- chitosan conjugated nanoparticles in 4:25 formulation can be used for treatment of NCI-H460 cells.
