1	Introduction
The theory of continuous domains, due to its strong background in computer science, general topology and topological algebra has been extensively studied by people from various areas (see [1,8]). Quasicontinuous domains is an very interesting topic in domain theory (see [6,7,10,11,14,15]). In [19], the concept of s2-quasicontinuous posets is introduced as a common generalization of both s2-continuous posets [2] and

quasicontinuous domains by making use of the cut operator instead of joins. The notion of s2-quasicontinuity admits to generalize most important characterizations of quasicontinuity from dcpos to arbitrary posets and has the advantage that not even the existence of directed joins has to be required.
Algebraic and quasialgebraic domains also proved to be very useful in various fields of order theory, topology and computer science (see [1,4,8,12,13,14,16,17,21]). In [4,20], the concept of s2-algebraic posets is introduced as a common generalization of both s2-continuous posets and algebraic domains. In this paper, we introduce new concept of s2-quasialgebraic posets as a common generalization of both s2-algebraic posets and s2-quasicontinuous posets. It is proved that a poset is s2-algebraic iff it is meet s2-continuous and s2-quasialgebraic. We also give the characterization that a poset is an s2-quasialgebraic iff the σ2-topology is a hypercontinuous and algebraic lattice. In last section, we investigate some dual categories on posets.

2	Preliminaries
For a poset P , let P (<ω) = {F ⊆ P : F is finite}. For all x ∈ P , A ⊆ P , let
↑x = {y ∈ P : x ≤ y} and ↑A = S	↑a; ↓x and ↓A are defined dually. A↑ and A↓
denote the sets of all upper and lower bounds of A, respectively. Let Aδ = (A↑)↓ and δ(P )= {Aδ : A ⊆ P}.
For a poset P , the topology generated by the collection of sets P\↓x (as a subbase) is called the upper topology and denoted by υ(P ); the lower topology ω(P ) on P is defined dually. A subset U of P is called Scott open provided that
U = ↑U and D ∩ U /= ∅ for all directed sets D ⊆ P with W D ∈ U whenever W D
exists. The topology formed by all the Scott open sets of P is called the Scott topology on P , written as σ(P ). The topology λ(P ) = σ(P ) ∨ ω(P ) is called the Lawson topology on P .
We order the collection of nonempty subsets of a poset P by G ≤ H if ↑H ⊆ ↑G (this is only a preorder, not an order, since it is typically not antisymmetric). We say that a nonempty family of sets is directed if given F1, F2 in the family, there exists F in the family such that F1, F2 ≤ F , i.e., F ⊆ ↑F1 ∩ ↑F2. For non-empty subsets F and G of a dcpo L, we say F approximates G if whenever a directed
subset D satisfies W D ∈ ↑G, then d ∈ ↑F for some d ∈ D. A dcpo L is called
a quasicontinuous domain if for all x ∈ L, ↑x is the directed (with respect to reverse inclusion) intersection of sets of the form ↑F , where F approximates {x} and F is finite. If in addition, it is possible to choose the finite sets F such that F approximates F for each F , then L is called a quasialgebraic domain.
Lemma 2.1 ([5]) Let P be a poset.
The maps (−)↑ : (2P )op → 2P , A '→ A↑ and (−)↓ : 2P → (2P )op, A '→ A↓ are order preserving.
((−)↑, (−)↓) is a Galois connection between (2P )op and 2P , that is, for all A, B ⊆ P, B↑ ⊇ A ⇔ B ⊆ A↓. Thus both δ : 2P → 2P , A '→ Aδ = (A↑)↓ and δ∗ : 2P → 2P , A '→ (A↓)↑ are closure operators.

Let L = δ(P ). For all {Aiδ : i ∈ I} ⊆ L,   {Aiδ : i ∈ I} =  {Aiδ : i ∈ I},
W	δ	S	δ	δ	S

L{Ai
: i ∈ I} =( 
{Ai
: i ∈ I})
=( 
i∈I
Ai)δ.

Definition 2.2 ([4,20]) Let P be a poset.
Given any two elements x and y in P , we say that x approximates y, written x  y, if for all directed sets D ⊆ P with y ∈ Dδ , there exists d ∈ D with x ≤ d. The set {y ∈ P : y  x} will be denoted ⇓x and {y ∈ P : x  y} denoted ⇑x. Let K(P )= {x ∈ P : x  x}.
P is called s2-continuous if for all x ∈ P , x ∈ (⇓x)δ and ⇓x is directed.
P is called s2-algebraic if for all x ∈ P , x ∈ (↓x ∩ K(P ))δ and ↓x ∩ K(P ) is directed.
Definition 2.3 ([3,9]) A poset P is called meet s2-continuous if for any x ∈ P and any directed set D with x ∈ Dδ, then x is in the σ2-closure of ↓x ∩ ↓D.
Corollary 2.4 ([19]) If F is a ﬁnite set in a meet s2-continuous poset, then we have
intσ (P )↑F ⊆ S{⇑x : x ∈ F}.
Definition 2.5 ([7]) For a complete lattice L, define a relation ≺ on L by x ≺ y ⇔
y ∈ intυ(L)↑x. L is called hypercontinuous if x = W{u ∈ L : u ≺ x} for all x ∈ L.
Definition 2.6 ([2,3]) Let P be a poset. A subset U ⊆ P is called σ2-open if for all directed sets D ⊆ P , Dδ ∩ U /= ∅ implies D ∩ U /= ∅.
The collection of all σ2-open subsets of P forms a topology, it will be called σ2- topology of P and will be denoted by σ2(P ). The topology λ2(P )= σ2(P ) ∨ ω(P ) is called the λ2-topology on P . Obviously, υ(P ) ⊆ σ2(P ) ⊆ σ(P ).
Remark 2.7 (1) For dcpos, the σ2-topology is the same as the Scott topology and the λ2-topology the same as the Lawson topology.
(2) U is σ2-open iff U = ↑U and U  U . Hence x ∈ U entails U  x.
Definition 2.8 ([19]) Let P be a poset.
For all G, H ⊆ P , we say that G is way below H or G approximates H and write G H if for all directed sets D ⊆ P , ↑H∩Dδ /= ∅ implies ↑G∩D /= ∅. We write G  x for G  {x} and y  H for {y} H. The set {x ∈ P : F  x} will be denoted ⇑F and {x ∈ P : x  F} denoted ⇓F . Let w(x)= {F ⊆ P : F is finite and F  x} and k(x)= {F ⊆ P : F is finite and F  F ≤ x}.
P is called an s2-quasicontinuous poset if for each x ∈ P , ↑x =  {↑F : F ∈
w(x)} and w(x) is directed.
Proposition 2.9 ([19]) Let F be a directed family of nonempty ﬁnite sets in a
poset. If G  x and   ↑F ⊆ ↑x, then F ⊆ ↑G for some F ∈ F.

3	s2-Quasialgebraic posets
In this section, the concept of s2-quasialgebraic posets is introduced and some topo- logical characterizations of s2-quasialgebraic posets are given. Particularly, we show that a poset P is s2-algebraic if and only if it is both meet s2-continuous and s2- quasialgebraic.
Definition 3.1 A poset P is called an s -quasialgebraic poset if for each x ∈ P ,
↑x =  {↑F : F ∈ k(x)} and k(x) is directed.
Remark 3.2 For dcpos the preceding definition of s2-quasialgebraic posets is equivalent to the standard one ([8, Definition III-3.23]).
Proposition 3.3 For a poset P, the following conditions are equivalent:
P is an s2-quasialgebraic poset;
P is an s2-quasicontinuous poset, and F   x iff there exists a ﬁnite G   G
with x ∈ ↑G ⊆ ↑F.
Proof. (1) ⇒ (2): Obviously, P is an s2-quasicontinuous poset. If F  x, then there exists a finite G  G with x ∈ ↑G ⊆ ↑F by Proposition 2.9. Conversely, if there exists a finite G  G with x ∈ ↑G ⊆ ↑F , then F ≤ G  G ≤ x. Thus F  x.
(2) ⇒ (1): Let x ∈ P and F1, F2 ∈ k(x). Then F1  x and F2  x. Since w(x) is directed, there exists F ∈ w(x) such that F ⊆ ↑F1 ∩ ↑F2. By (2), there exists a finite G  G with x ∈ ↑G ⊆ ↑F . So k(x) is directed.
Obviously, ↑x ⊆ {↑F : F ∈ k(x)}. If y ∈/ ↑x, then there exists H ∈ w(x) such that y ∈/ ↑H since P is s2-quasicontinuous. By (2), there exists a finite E  E with x ∈ ↑E ⊆ ↑H. Thus E ∈ k(x) and y ∈/ ↑E. Therefore, P is s2-quasialgebraic.  2
Now we give the topological characterizations of s2-quasialgebraic posets.
Proposition 3.4 For a poset P, the following conditions are equivalent:
P is an s2-quasialgebraic poset;
For each (x, U ) ∈ P × σ2(P ) with x ∈ U, there exists F ∈ P (<ω) such that
x ∈ intσ2(P )↑F = ↑F ⊆ U;
(σ2(P ), ⊆) is a hypercontinuous and algebraic lattice;
For each compact set K in (P, σ2(P )) and U ∈ σ2(P ), if K ⊆ U, then there exists F ∈ P (<ω) such that K ⊆ intσ2(P )↑F = ↑F ⊆ U;
For each compact set K in (P, σ (P )), the family {F ⊆ P : F is ﬁnite and K ⊆ intσ (P )↑F = ↑F} is directed and ↑K =  {↑F: F is ﬁnite and K ⊆ intσ2(P )↑F = ↑F}.
Proof. (1) ⇒ (2): Let (x, U ) ∈ P × σ2(P ) with x ∈ U . Then U  x. By Proposition 2.9, there exists F ∈ k(x) such that ↑F ⊆ U . Since F  F implies intσ2(P )↑F = ↑F , x ∈ intσ2(P )↑F = ↑F ⊆ U .
⇔ (3): This follows from Lemma 2.2 of [18].

(2) ⇒ (4): Suppose that K is a compact set in (P, σ2(P )) and K ⊆ U ∈ σ2(P ). For each x ∈ K, by (2), there is Fx ∈ P (<ω) such that x ∈ intσ (P )↑Fx = ↑Fx ⊆ U .

Hence K ⊆
S
x∈K
intσ2(P )↑Fx =
S
x∈K
2
↑Fx ⊆ U . By the compactness of K, there exists

a finite set {x1, x2,..., xn} ⊆ K such that K ⊆
Sn
i=1
intσ2(P )↑Fxi . Let F =
Sn
i=1
Fxi .

Then F ∈ P (<ω) and K ⊆ intσ (P )↑F = ↑F ⊆ U .
(4) ⇒ (5): Suppose F1, F2 ∈ {F ⊆ P : F is finite and K ⊆ intσ2(P )↑F = ↑F}. Then K ⊆ intσ (P )↑F1 ∩intσ (P )↑F2 ∈ σ2(P ). By (4), there is F3 ∈ P (<ω) such that K ⊆ intσ2(P )↑F3 = ↑F3 ⊆ intσ2(P )↑F1 ∩ intσ2(P )↑F2; and hence F3 ∈ {F ⊆ P : F is finite and K ⊆ intσ2(P )↑F = ↑F} and ↑F3 ⊆ ↑F1 ∩ ↑F2. Therefore, {F ⊆ P : F is finite and K ⊆ intσ (P )↑F = ↑F} is directed. Clearly, ↑K ⊆ {↑F : F is finite and K ⊆ intσ2(P )↑F = ↑F}. If z ∈/ ↑K, then K ⊆ P\↓z ∈ σ2(P ). By (4), there is
G ∈ P (<ω) with K ⊆ intσ (P )↑G = ↑G ⊆ P\↓z. It follows that G ∈ {F : F is finite

2
and K ⊆ intσ2(P )↑F = ↑F} and z ∈/ ↑G. Therefore, ↑K =
K ⊆ intσ2(P )↑F = ↑F}.
 {↑F : F is finite and

(5) ⇒ (1): Since the set {x} is compact for each x ∈ P .	2
Corollary 3.5 For a poset P, the following conditions are equivalent:
P is an s2-quasialgebraic poset;
P is an s2-quasicontinuous poset, and the σ2-topology has a base consisting of compact-open sets;
P is an s2-quasicontinuous poset, and (σ2(P ), ⊆) is an algebraic lattice.
Observe that an s2-quasialgebraic poset is generally not actually an s2-algebraic poset (s2-algebraic posets are a special kind of s2-quasialgebraic posets in which the collection of finite sets F  F is replaced by a collection of singleton subsets). How- ever, s2-quasialgebraic posets have many properties similar to those of s2-algebraic posets and quasialgebraic domains.
Example 3.6 Let P = {a}∪ {an : n ∈ N}. The partial order on P is defined by setting an < an+1 for all n ∈ N, and a1 < a. Then P is an s2-quasialgebraic poset which is not s2-algebraic.
Theorem 3.7 Let P be a poset. The following conditions are equivalent:
P is an s2-algebraic poset;
P is a meet s2-continuous and s2-quasialgebraic poset;
P is a meet s2-continuous poset, ↓x ∩ K(P ) is directed for all x ∈ P, and whenever x ¢ y in P, then there are U ∈ σ2(P ) and V ∈ ω(P ) such that x ∈ U, y ∈ V , U ∩ V = ∅ and U ∪ V = P.
Proof. (1) ⇒ (2): Obviously.
(2) ⇒ (3): Firstly, we assume that x ¢ y in P . Then x ∈ P\↓y ∈ σ2(P ). By Proposition 2.9, there exists F ∈ P (<ω) such that x ∈ intσ2(P )↑F = ↑F ⊆ P\↓y. Let U = intσ2(P )↑F and V = P\↑F . Then x ∈ U ∈ σ2(P ), y ∈ V ∈ ω(P ),

U ∩ V = ∅ and U ∪ V = P .
Then we show that ↓x ∩ K(P ) is directed for all x ∈ P . On the one hand, let u, v ∈ ↓x ∩ K(P ). Then x ∈ ↑u ∩ ↑v ∈ σ2(P ). By Proposition 2.9, there exists F ∈ P (<ω) such that x ∈ intσ (P )↑F = ↑F ⊆ ↑u ∩ ↑v. Since F is finite,
↑F = ↑Min(F) where Min(F) is the set of all minimal elements in F . By Corollary
2.4, x ∈ ↑Min(F) = ↑F= intσ (P)↑F= intσ (P)↑Min(F) ⊆ S{⇑t:t ∈ Min(F)}. So
2	2	S
there exists t ∈ Min(F) with t   x. Since ↑Min(F) ⊆	{⇑t : t ∈ Min(F)}, there
exists s ∈ Min(F) with s   t, hence s ≤ t. So s = t since s, t ∈ Min(F). Thus t ∈ ↓x ∩ K(P ) and t ∈ ↑u ∩ ↑v. On the other hand, since P is an s2-quasialgebraic poset, there exists G ∈ P (<ω) such that x ∈ intσ (P )↑G = ↑G ⊆ P . Similarly, we can show that there is a y ∈ Min(G) with y ∈ ↓x ∩ K(P ). Thus ↓x ∩ K(P ) /= ∅. Therefore, ↓x ∩ K(P ) is directed.
⇒ (1): For all x ∈ P , we show x = W(↓x ∩ K(P )). Clearly, x is an upper
bound of ↓x ∩ K(P ). Let y be any upper bound of ↓x ∩ K(P ) and assume x ¢ y. By (3), there are U ∈ σ2(P ) and V ∈ ω(P ) such that x ∈ U , y ∈ V , U ∩ V = ∅ and U ∪ V = P . We may assume that V is a basic ω-open set, i.e., there exists F ∈ P (<ω) such that V = P\↑F . From U ∩ V = ∅ and U ∪ V = P , U = ↑F follows. So x ∈ intσ2(P )↑F = ↑F . It is similar to the proof of (2) ⇒ (3), there exists
t ∈ ↓x ∩ K(P ) such that t ∈ ↑F . Since y is an upper bound of ↓x ∩ K(P ), y ∈ ↑F ,
a contradiction to y ∈ V = P\↑F .	2
Corollary 3.8 Let P be a dcpo. The following conditions are equivalent:
P is an algebraic domain;
P is a meet continuous and quasialgebraic domain;
P is a meet continuous domain, ↓x ∩ K(P ) is directed for all x ∈ P, and whenever x ¢ y in P, then there are U ∈ σ(P ) and V ∈ ω(P ) such that x ∈ U, y ∈ V , U ∩ V = ∅ and U ∪ V = P.
Let (X, τ, ≤) be a partially ordered topological space. (X, τ, ≤) is called totally order-disconnected if whenever x ¢ y there is a clopen upper set U such that x ∈ U and y ∈/ U . A compact order-disconnected space is called a Priestley space ([16]).
Corollary 3.9 Let P be a complete lattice. The following conditions are equivalent:
P is an algebraic lattice;
P is a meet continuous and quasialgebraic lattice;
P is a meet continuous lattice, and (P, λ(P ), ≤) is a Priestley space.
Since the lattice of open sets of any topological space is a Heyting algebra, we have the following.
Corollary 3.10 For a topological space X, let O(X) denote the lattice of open sets of X. Then the following conditions are equivalent:
(O(X), ⊆) is an algebraic lattice;
(O(X), ⊆) is a quasialgebraic lattice;

The Lawson topology of (O(X), ⊆) is a Priestley space.
4	Dual categories on posets
A function f : P → Q between posets is σ2-continuous iff it is continuous with respect to the σ2-topologies, that is, f−1(U ) ∈ σ2(P ) for all U ∈ σ2(Q). In [4], Ern´e proved that f : P → Q is σ2-continuous iff f (Dδ) ⊆ f (D)δ for all directed subsets D of P .
Definition 4.1 Let P , Q be two posets. Q is called a σ2-continuous retract of P if there exist σ2-continuous functions f : P → Q and g : Q → P such that f ◦ j = gQ.
Theorem 4.2 Let P, Q be two posets. If P is s2-quasicontinuous and Q is a
σ2-continuous retract of P, then Q is s2-quasicontinuous.
Proof. Since Q is a σ2-continuous retract of P , there exist σ2-continuous functions f : P → Q and g : Q → P such that f ◦ j = gQ. For every x ∈ Q and finite set F   g(x), we claim that f (F )  x. Indeed, let D be a directed set of Q with x ∈ Dδ; then g(x) ∈ g(Dδ) ⊆ g(D)δ and we obtain an element d ∈ D such that g(d) ∈ ↑F because F  g(x). So we get d = f (g(d)) ∈ f (↑F ) ⊆ ↑f (F ), and the claim is true. Since P is s2-quasicontinuous and f is order preserving, the family
{f (F ): F is finite and F  g(x)} is directed.
Given x, y ∈ Q with x ¢ y, then x = f (g(x)) ∈ Q\↓y and we get g(x) ∈ f−1(Q\↓y) ∈ σ2(P ). Since P is s2-quasicontinuous, there exists finite F  g(x) such that F ⊆ f−1(Q\↓y). This means that f (F ) ⊆ Q\↓y. By the claim above we know that f (F )  x. So for every x ∈ Q, we have ↑x =  {↑f (F ): F is finite and F  g(x)}. Thus Q is s2-quasicontinuous.	2
Definition 4.3 ([8]) Let P and Q be two posets. We shall say that a pair (g, d) of functions f : P → Q and g : Q → P is a Galois connection, if both f and g are order preserving, and for all (x, y) ∈ P × Q, f (x) ≥ y iff x ≥ g(y). In an adjunction (f, g), the function f is called the upper adjoint and g the lower adjoint.
Proposition 4.4 Let d : T → S be the upper adjoint of a monotone map g : S → T between posets. Then d(Aδ) ⊆ d(A)δ for all A ⊆ T . In particular, d is σ2-continuous.
Proof. Let A ⊆ T . If there exists x ∈ Aδ with d(x) ∈/ d(A)δ, then there is y ∈ S with d(A) ⊆ ↓y such that d(x) ¢ y. Thus x ¢ g(y), hence A ¢ ↓g(y). Since d(A) ⊆ ↓y, d(a) ≤ y for all a ∈ A. So a ≤ g(y) for all a ∈ A, which implies A ⊆ ↓g(y), a contradiction to A ¢ ↓g(y).	2
Proposition 4.5 Let P and Q be posets and f : P → Q the upper adjoint of
g : Q → P. Consider the following conditions:
f is σ2-continuous;
for all U ∈ σ2(Q), ↑g(U ) ∈ σ2(P );
g preserves  , that is, if F   G in Q, then g(F )  g(G) in P.

Then (1) ⇔ (2) ⇒ (3). If Q is an s2-quasicontinuous poset, then (3) ⇒ (1).
Proof. (1) ⇒ (2): Let U ∈ σ2(Q). In order to show that ↑g(U ) ∈ σ2(P ), we take a directed set D ⊆ P with Dδ ∩ ↑g(U ) /= ∅ and we show that D ∩ ↑g(U ) /= ∅. Since Dδ ∩ ↑g(U ) /= ∅, there exists x ∈ Dδ and y ∈ U such that g(y) ≤ x. So y ≤ f (x). By (1), f (x) ∈ f (Dδ) ⊆ f (D)δ. Since f is order preserving, f (D) is directed and y ∈ f (D)δ. Thus U ∩ f (D) /= ∅, that is, there is a d ∈ D with f (d) ∈ U ; hence gf (d) ∈ g(U ). But gf (d) ≤ d, so d ∈ ↑g(U ). Thus D ∩ ↑g(U ) /= ∅.
(2) ⇒ (1): Let D ⊆ P be a directed set with x ∈ Dδ. If f (x) ∈/ f (D)δ, then there exists y ∈ Q such that f (D) ⊆ ↓y and f (x) ¢ y. So f (x) ∈ Q\↓y ∈ σ2(Q). Let U = Q\↓y. Since gf (x) ∈ g(U ) and gf (x) ≤ x, By (2), x ∈ ↑g(U ) ∈ σ2(P ). Thus D ∩ ↑g(U ) /= ∅, that is, there exists d ∈ D and z ∈ U such that g(z) ≤ d; hence z ≤ f (d). Thus f (d) ∈ U = Q\↓y, a contradiction to f (D) ⊆ ↓y. So f (Dδ) ⊆ f (D)δ.
(1) ⇒ (3): Suppose F  G in Q and let D ⊆ P be directed with ↑g(G)∩Dδ /= ∅. So there is a y ∈ G with g(y) ∈ Dδ. By hypothesis y ≤ fg(y) ∈ f (Dδ) ⊆ f (D)δ. Since f is order preserving, f (D) is directed and y ∈ f (D)δ, that is, ↑G∩f (D)δ /= ∅. Thus ↑F ∩ f (D) /= ∅, that is, there exist d ∈ D and x ∈ F such that x ≤ f (d); hence g(x) ≤ d. Thus g(F )  g(G).
(3) ⇒ (1): Suppose Q is an s2-quasicontinuous poset. For all U ∈ σ2(Q), we show that f−1(U ) ∈ σ2(P ). Let D ⊆ P be directed with Dδ ∩ f−1(U ) /= ∅. Then there exists x ∈ Dδ with f (x) ∈ U . Since Q is an s2-quasicontinuous poset, there exists a finite F  f (x) with F ⊆ U . By (3), g(F )  gf (x) ≤ x; hence g(F )  x. So ↑g(F ) ∩ D /= ∅, that is, there exist d ∈ D and z ∈ F such that g(z) ≤ d. Since z ≤ fg(z), fg(z) ∈ U and g(z) ∈ f−1(U ). So D ∩ f−1(U ) /= ∅ since f is order preserving. Thus f−1(U ) ∈ σ2(P ).	2
Definition 4.6 We introduce the following categories:
POG has as objects posets and as morphisms σ2-continuous maps g that have a lower adjoint.
POD has as objects posets and as morphisms maps d that have an upper adjoint and the property that for each σ2-open U in the domain of d the set
↑d(U ) is σ2-open in the range. (Note that such maps are σ2-continuous.)
QCG has as objects s2-quasicontinuous posets and as morphisms σ2-continuous maps that have a lower adjoint.
QCD has as objects s2-quasicontinuous posets and as morphisms maps that have an upper adjoint and preserve the way-below relation  .
By [8, Lemma IV-1.2] and Proposition 4.5, we have the following
Theorem 4.7 The following pairs of categories are dual under the adjoint functors
D and G:
POG and POD.
QCG and QCD.
