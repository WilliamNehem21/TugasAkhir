The present study was designed to explore ethnopharmacological anti-inflammatory plants in the anti- cancer drug development. From the specialized local herbalists of the study area, who were treating tumors using anti-inflammatory plants by considering as a type of inflammation and explaining the potential of anti-inflammatory plants in prevalence of early stage’s cancer. Interaction results obtained from the herbalists, and in silico PASS and CLC-pred prediction results were greatly agreed with docu- mented data. Documentation was done through semi-structure standard designed proforma from the selected herbalist in study locality. A number of active compounds selected from recorded plants subse- quently analyzed by using computational in silico tools such as PASS, admetSAR, and CLC-pred to inves- tigate the antineoplastic capacity of anti-inflammatory plants. About 18 out of 20 plants said to be used in tumor-related affliction recognized for antineoplastic capacity using PASS database with high probability. Similarly, the selected compound’s absorption, metabolism, and toxicity also predicted using the admetSAR tool. CLC-pred Tools performed to examine the different cell line cytotoxicity of compounds with respective probabilities.

Introduction

Ethnopharmacology becomes an important field to elucidate and justify the indigenous medicinal benefits bioactive of plant compounds through various biochemicals and experimental mod- els [1]. India is one among the country which has potent knowl- edge of ancient treatment of medicinal plants. Tribal people encompass vast recognition of treatment by plant therapy, and their historical knowledge has guaranteed results over novel experimental studies of plants secondary metabolites as a source to draw anti-inflammatory drugs [1–3]. Wound inflammation, especially chronic wound is considered as a freighting issue on physical welfare, which is tough one to cure. Plant based medica- ments are advised because of easy accessibility and better wound healing property of compounds [4,5]. India has documented 45,000 series of plants roughly 7500 species reputable as medicinal plants. Earlier system of Indian medicine ‘‘Ayurveda” describes healing properties as ‘Vranaropaka’ and treated with medicinal plants [6,7].

Cancer, a complicated disease holds the second position to cause death in all over the globe, and the incidences were discov- ered high in western countries comparatively than Asian countries. Ayurveda explains continuous irritation may lead to cancer under Granthi or Arbuda (inflammatory disease) that is a neoplasm will have the possibility to develop the malignancy and can treatable at early stage [8]. Due to the competence of preventing cancer, plants based compounds, which possess anti-inflammatory activ- ity, are also used in cancer treatment [9]. Probably customary medicines are worked based on the synergistic effect of whole plant extract while modern medicines isolate a single plant com- pound [10,11].
Computational tools have become very much important in medicinal chemistry to predict the bioactivities of particular com- pounds based on structure–activity relationships, which are signif- icantly correlated with experimental results [12]. The physical and chemical properties of plant based compounds were analyzed using in silico prediction models for their effective absorption metabolism and toxicity. These in silico techniques combined with pharmacology studies would greatly influence in discovery of novel drugs for ailments [13,14].
In the present study an attempt made to predict the anticar- cinogenic activity of compounds presented in plants with wound

healing anti-inflammatory to explore the new plant compounds for anticancer activity through in silico studies. This also rationally proceeds towards interdisciplinary understanding of developing anticancer drugs from wound healing plants existed in traditional practices.

Materials and methods

Study area and tribal ethnography

Sathyamangalam wildlife sanctuary lies between Tamil Nadu and Karnataka boundary regions with 77° 150 000 E longitude and 11° 310 1100 N latitude. Vegetation of the forest varies from tropical to temperate zones this forest extends east from Nilgiris. The thicket jungle is one of the piece elements of Western Ghats
enhanced with diverse species of plant and animal covers about 1411.6 km2 (545.0 sq mi) [15–17]. The moderate annual rainfall of the Sathyamangalam wildlife sanctuary is 824 mm, which located between the Western Ghats and the Eastern Ghats like a bridge. Wildlife Institute of India categorized the sanctuary as East- ern Ghats province in Biogeography classification (Fig. 1).
The forest is diversified with various tribal communities, including Irulas, Soligas, Kurumbas, Urali and also least distributed communities of Malayalee and Naickers. Urali is one of the domi- nants locale’s tribal groups migrated and largely settled in Sathya- mangalam forest with Urali language. The villager’s main job is to sell the forest products such as honey, fuel wood, resins and medic- inal herbs.

Data collection

The importance of each plant species among ethnic people was determined by use value (UV). The use value to a species (UV) is the summation over the number of use reports for the specific plant species (U) and is divided by the total number of informants
(N) interviewed. If the use value is high, it indicates the many use reports and importance to the plant, and low value indicates the less use reports. This was calculated as follows.
UV ¼ X UR/N

Identification of plant specimens

Identification of collected plant materials was performed by referring different regional floras and pertinent literature such as Flora of the Presidency of Madras, Flora of Tamil Nadu and Flora of the Tamilnadu Carnatic [18–20]. Then the plant materials were poisoned, pressed and preserved in a standard herbarium sheet. The collected specimens were compared and identified by the Madras herbarium (MH) Botanical Survey of India, Southern Regio- nal Centre, Coimbatore, India. Further the confirmation made using The Plant List and International Plant Name Index [21,22] and Fig. 2 provides the identified plants.

In silico prediction using PASS and ADMET

Computer-aided structure-activity based prediction studies in drug design helps to treat diseases with novel biomarkers. Predic- tion of activity spectra for substances (PASS) database comprised 46,000 biologically well-known active drugs and screening are per- formed before the establishment of an in vitro experiment. PASS gives the significant bioactivities of chemical compounds as Pa (Probable activity) and Pi (Probable inactivity) values to mention the compounds, whether they are active are inactive. The Pa values higher than 0.7 indicated this compound would be active in exper-
iment and Pi values indicate theirs inactivate possibilities. The admetSAR chemoinformatics based tool used to predict absorption, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity of the particular compound. Based on these criteria, the outcomes of an in vitro experiment will lower the risk of negative results [13,14].

In silico prediction of cell line cytotoxicity with CLC-Pred tool

CLC-Pred Tools performed to predict cytotoxicity of tumor cell lines, and it is based on structure-cell line cytotoxicity relation- ships designed by PASS special training sets with leave-one-out cross-validation procedure. The accuracy of in silico prediction results significantly 96% matches with the results of in vivo exper- imental. The efficiency of compounds against cancer could be found and optimized using this PASS based CLC-Pred database in the future to develop potential anti-cancer drugs. Predicted cyto- toxicity gives results against various human cell lines represented with Pa values if Pa value is >0.5 the probability of action is consid- erably high and whereas Pi value indicates inactivity [23].

Result and discussion

Demography and ethnography of informants

Informant’s selection was done randomly of all communities from different tribal settlement areas. Among gathered peoples a total number of 35 informants selected after the primary group discussion in all settlement groups by their knowledge about the traditional treatments on wounds, inflammation, and cancer. The age of selected 35 informants varies from 45 to 65 years, including male (14) females (21). From the 35 informants, 10 healers were identified as herbalists among them 3 of were female and the rest were male (7) (Table 1). Between 10 herbalists, 8 herbalists (2 female; 6 males with >55 years old) were agreed to the statement that they are treating tumors with anti-inflammatory plants (Table 1). A formal questionnaire was prepared and orally asked to refer the definition of wounds and tumor, how the wounds and tumor will be treated; preparation method adopted, the proce- dure of administration, duration of administration, the local name of the tumor and wounds and types of tumor they experienced.
The interrogation confesses chronic inflammation wounds may develop into the tumor but in the early stage, this can be curable. They are terming cancer as Katti in local language and also inter- estingly the herbalists were treating tumors of specific organ includes uterine fibroids caused through heredity and irregular menstrual cycle, Gastric tumor caused by chronic inflammation and ulceration (Table 2). The understanding and informative views about cancer among tribal dwellers are greatly agreed to the liter- ature statement of causes of cancer, and also the chronic wounds were treated with herbalist prescription [5,24], among tribal inhabitants these complications were treated carefully in order to avoid forming tumor from chronic inflammation. Based on this, the entire primary ethno botanical investigation figured out locales having trivial knowledge about tumor treating plants, which are also used during the wound healing and inflammation activities.

Anti-inflammatory plants in cancer

The individual with most use-reports was considered as com- mon medicine for a particular ailment treatment. Based on the use-reports collected from ethnic people use value (UV) was calcu- lated to highlight the usage priority, importance, recommendation and sharing medicinal knowledge about the particular species among the informants. In this study Abutilon indicum (L.) Sweet,. (UV-0.60), Lawsonia inermis L., Lycopersicon esculentum Mill

(UV-0.63), and Madhuca indica J.F.Gmel. (UV-0.66) showed com- mendable values this indicates the importance to the species among the studied area tribes (Table 3). However, least values indi- cate the limited knowledge of medicinal uses and may be due to its adverse effects of those plants.
Leaves are the dominant part used in the medicinal plant prepa- ration for treating inflammatory, wounds and cancer from the study area followed by bark, seed, tuber, and whole plant part (Table 3). Basically, leaves are the uncomplicated plant part in col- lection and in systematic perspective leaves are loaded with the huge amount of metabolites comparing to other parts through the plant [25]. Present investigation comes out with the usage of adjuvant among the tribal community with 9 plants followed by 11 plants individual consumption (Table 3). The practice of utiliz- ing adjuvants like honey, salt, milk and curd is a habit of Indian tri-
bal inhabitants already reported for Taungya, Terai and Kani tribals in India. Usong adjuvants are technically for higher bioavailability, which leads for synergistic effect to cure the disease better [25,26]. The preparation methods for anti-inflammatory activity were mostly in dry powder form to treat wounds and skin tumors [7]. The other methods, including paste and decoction were used to treat skin and stomach ailments were treated with juice (Table 3) and extraction methods considerably uncommon to treat stomach and bladder problems [24].

In silico prediction results of PASS and admetSAR

In silico tools used for pre-screening of compound activities and direct the studies towards the prior designing of particular work. PASS is a well-known tool used in almost all pharmaceutical

industries which based on structure–activity relationship’s analy- sis [27]. About 23 compounds corresponding to 20 plant species were selected and interpreted in PASS database to obtain the pre- diction of bioactivity. The collected 20 anti-inflammatory species which also observed to be used in tumor treatment by tribal inhab- itants were predicted by PASS and indicated the existence of antineoplastic activity in 18 reported plants. The compound aris- tolochic acid from Aristolochia bracteolate Lam. showed higher probabilities for the antiseptic (0.968/0.002), respiratory analeptic (0.828/0.007) and apoptosis agonist (0.821/0.007) in prediction
(Table 4) but various studies shows that aristolochic acid can be used on many types of cancer, including bladder cancer it closely resembles with the statement of usage of Aristolochia bracteolate Lam. in urinary track cancer and inflammation activity [26]. From the present study area, it’s clearly evidenced that the usage of aris- tolochic acid contained plants as a medicine existed previously in Indian subcontinent [28].
Congruently Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn also has shown activities like antineurotic (0.851/0.009), antitussive (0.836/0.003) and anti eczematic (0.851/0.010) and these also comparably to the herbalist information obtained from the study area, and the seeds are used in hepatocellular carcinoma [29]. These two inferences from in sil- ico prediction, documentation of study data and pertinent litera- ture briefly quoted the correlation between anti-inflammatory plants in cancer and apparently. It supports description in Ayur- veda, which cited 5000 years back as inflammation can lead to can- cer [10]. Comprehension of the total number of 19 species collected from the study location manifest various bioactivity in the PASS prediction indicated as apoptosis agonist, hepatoprotec- tant, and insulin promoter other than antineoplastic, which hold desired different probabilities (Table 4). The database of admetSAR is a mechanized free tool which predicts assimilation profiles of drugs as takes after intestinal ingestion, P-glycoprotein substrate and inhibitor, plasma protein restricting correspondingly unique

kind of digestion as cytochrome substrate, inhibitor, activator and poisonous quality profiles like medication instigated liver damage, mutagenicity, cancer-causing agents [30]. As indicated by the results displayed in Table 4, all the compounds reported from listed plants, demonstrated low toxicity and low carcinogenicity. From the outcomes, all the reported compounds were considered as they can metabolize easily without causing much of problems, retained and transported through human intestinal.

presented in a Pa values, which is >0.5 are probably more active with the predicted cancer cell line. From the 20 plants 23 of com- pounds specifically selected and executed for cytotoxicity activity prediction in different cell lines by employing CLC-Pred tool. Almost all the plants showed aspirated outcome and barely three compounds displayed negative results those compounds are aris- tolochic acid (Aristolochia bracteolata Lam.), skimmianine (Chlorox- ylon swietenia DC.) and vitexicarpin (Vitex negundo L). The aristolochic acid CLC-Pred negative result greatly concurs in the result of PASS, but it is rationally used for tumor contradict vitexi- carpin showed positive correlation with both PASS prediction and study result (Tables 4 and 5).
The maximum number of different cell line prediction were col- lected and tabulated with respective cancer type, probability, and type of cell. The compounds oleanolic acid and ursolic acid from Leucas aspera (Willd.) Link showed significant cytotoxity against stomach adenocarcinoma (0.820/MKN-74), thyroid carcinoma (0.592/8505C), upper aero digestive tract carcinoma (0.505/FaDu), pancreas adenocarcinoma (0.504/ASPC-1), and stomach carcinoma (0.502/MKN-7) with significant Pa values (Table 5). Likewise, sesa- min of Sesamum indicum L. renders strong activity against lung car- cinoma (0.760/A549), central nervous system oligodendroglioma
(0.687/Hs683), central nervous system glioblastoma (0.522/SF- 295), colon adenocarcinoma (0.506/HCC2998) and stomach adeno- carcinoma (0.505/MKN-74) besides vasicinone from Sida acuta Burm.f. showed cytotoxicity against central nervous system oligo- dendroglioma (0.562/Hs683), Pleura mesothelioma (0.588/NCI- H2052) and lung carcinoma (0.530/PC-6). The other remaining compounds from the reported plants, Madhuca indica J.F.Gmel. (betulinic acid) (4), Lawsonia inermis L. (lawsaritol, Lawsone) (4), Abutilon indicum (L.) Sweet (Abruslactone A) (3), Lycopersicon escu- lentum Mill. (lycopene) (3), Polyalthia longifolia (Sonn.) Thwaites (liriodenine) (3), Chloroxylon swietenia DC (skimmianine, Swieteni- din B) (2), Diospyros montana Roxb. (Diospyrin) (2), Gmelina arborea Roxb. (epieudesmin) (2) and Mallotus philippensis (Lam.) Müll.Arg. (friedelin) (2) showed cytotoxicity against various cell lines respective of their affecting tissue. Nyctanthes arbor-tristis L. (nyctanthic acid) inversely Butea monosperma (butin), Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn (Nuciferine) Tribulus terrestris L. (harmine) pre- dicted with single cell lines cytotoxicity activity (Table 5).
Tribulus terrestris L. displayed only lung adenocarcinoma cyto- toxicity whereas present study and literature survey matches for hepatocellular carcinoma [31] comparatively Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn. mentioned to have traditionally used for inflammation

and cancer it greatly resembles with present study [32]. Likewise, Butea monosperma reported for its traditional usage as the anti- inflammatory and strong anti-cancer against hepatoma cells [33]. Above assertion grant adequate knowledge about the interconnec- tion between anti-inflammatory plants with anti- cancer proper- ties, and it authenticates undoubtedly Indian tradition of medicine have sufficient skills in treating cancer-related ailments and other disparate afflictions as evinced in ‘‘Ayurveda.”
Conclusion

Studies on ethno medicinal anti-inflammatory and wound heal- ing was abundant all over the world beyond particular attention paid to Indian ethnic societies, which have age-old therapeutic practices and guidelines for prescription medicaments by herbalist and traditional healers. The present study documented about 20 ethno medicinal plants that are utilized as anti-inflammatory,



wound healing agents and also in the treatment of cancer based on the traditional reports, particularly Nyctanthes arbor-tristis, Butea monosperma; Tribulus terrestris predicted cytotoxicity activity sig- nificantly correlated with the literature survey. The selected com- pounds from reported plants revealed significant anticancer activity in CLC-Pred prediction and PASS tools. This study entirely draws the appreciable output on the relationship of anti- inflammatory plants in cancer and moreover, the in silico studies assessed extremely the presence of anticancer activity. This study showed the possibility to correlate ethno pharmacological thera- pies to develop new pharmaceutical drugs thus can accelerate the interpretative analysis of the ethnic anti-inflammatory plants in the development of anti-cancerous drugs.
