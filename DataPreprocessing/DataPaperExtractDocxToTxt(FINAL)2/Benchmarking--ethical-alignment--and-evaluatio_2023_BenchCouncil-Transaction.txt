Introduction

In recent years, the rapid rise of conversational AI systems has reshaped human–computer interactions, propelling us towards a future where natural language conversations with machines become common- place. Among the myriad of AI systems, ChatGPT, a product of OpenAI, has emerged as a paragon, showcasing remarkable language generation capabilities [1,2]. As this field gains momentum, the necessity to create stringent benchmarks, adaptable standards, and intelligent evaluation criteria becomes paramount to drive responsible development and constant refinement of systems like ChatGPT [3–5].
ChatGPT has garnered significant attention for its impressive lan- guage generation capabilities and ability to engage in contextually rel- evant conversations. However, the evaluation of such systems presents unique challenges that need to be addressed to ensure their continuous improvement and responsible development.
The need for robust benchmarks, adaptive standards, and intelligent evaluation criteria arises from the increasing demand for conversational AI systems that can understand and respond to human queries, provide meaningful interactions, and maintain ethical considerations [6–9].

The evaluation of these systems requires a comprehensive and multi- dimensional approach that goes beyond traditional metrics and em- braces the complexities of language understanding, context awareness, and ethical alignment.
Motivated by these challenges, this paper proposes a comprehensive evaluation framework for ChatGPT that encompasses prominent bench- marks, adaptive standards, and intelligent evaluation methods [10–12]. The framework aims to enhance the performance assessment, ethical alignment, and user satisfaction of ChatGPT. By providing a clear roadmap for evaluation, the proposed framework ensures the responsi- ble and impactful development of ChatGPT and future conversational AI systems [13,14].
Our research objectives are multi-pronged:

Performance Assessment Enhancement: We endeavor to design task-specific benchmarks and evaluation metrics to assess Chat- GPT’s prowess across an array of conversational tasks, emphasiz- ing its comprehension of context, maintenance of coherence, and delivery of precise and relevant responses.

Our ultimate goal is to develop an integrated evaluation frame- work that facilitates the development of conversational AI systems that are not only proficient linguistically, but also ethically aligned, user- centric, and adaptable to evolving challenges and expectations. The ensuing sections will unpack the specifics of our evaluation framework for ChatGPT, offering a comprehensive analysis that serves to drive the responsible and impactful development of conversational AI systems.

State-of-the-art of benchmarks, standards, and evaluation cri- teria

Benchmarking is required for ChatGPT to ensure the model’s per- formance meets the objectives and standards set by its developers and users. A few key reasons for this necessity are:
	Quality Assurance: Benchmarking helps verify that the model’s responses are accurate, contextually appropriate, and free from factual errors or misconceptions. It checks whether the model can understand and generate text in a manner that meets the expectations for human-like conversation.
Improvement Over Time: By benchmarking, developers can identify the model’s strengths and weaknesses. This informa- tion guides the future improvement of the model, enhancing its performance over time.
User Experience: Benchmarking is crucial to ensure a positive user experience. The model should respond to users in a way that is engaging, helpful, and respectful. The ability to manage various conversational scenarios is key to meeting user expectations.
Ethical Compliance: With benchmarking, developers can ensure that the model handles sensitive topics appropriately, respects user privacy, and adheres to the guidelines for responsible AI usage.
Comparison with Other Models: Finally, benchmarking allows for an objective comparison of ChatGPT with other AI models. This can aid in choosing the best tool for specific applications and helps in communicating the model’s capabilities to potential users or stakeholders.
Benchmarking the efficacy of ChatGPT demands meticulous plan- ning, along with the strategic implementation of multiple key measures.
Firstly, human-like conversation simulation should be checked: can it maintain relevant and engaging dialogue, mirroring the co- herence, empathy, humor, and complexity a human might offer?
Next, factual accuracy is critical — the AI should provide up- to-date, reliable information consistent with its knowledge cut- off. Natural language understanding and generation are essential too, evidenced by the model’s ability to parse complex input and create grammatically sound, clear and concise output. Fur- thermore, the model’s capacity for context-awareness is crucial, keeping track of ongoing conversations and adapting responses to situational nuances.
Lastly, but not least, ethical considerations must be evaluated, ob- serving how well the model respects privacy, avoids inappropriate content, and handles sensitive topics. Therefore, a comprehensive benchmark for ChatGPT necessitates a holistic assessment, scru- tinizing not only its intellectual prowess but also its ability to maintain meaningful, responsible, and human-like interactions.

Evaluation criteria

This subsection discusses common evaluation methods used in con- versational AI, including BLEU [28], ROUGE [29], METEOR [30], precision–recall, F1 score, perplexity, and user feedback.

BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR
Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) is commonly used for eval- uating the quality of machine translation or text generation. It com- pares the n-gram overlap between the generated text and one or more reference texts as shown in Eq. (1).
𝐵𝐿𝐸𝑈 = 𝐵𝑃 ∗ 𝑒𝑥𝑝(𝑠𝑢𝑚(𝑤𝑖 ∗ log(𝜋)))	(1)
BP (Brevity Penalty) is a penalty term that accounts for the difference in length between the generated and reference texts.
𝜋 is the modified n-gram precision, which measures the ratio of
n-grams in the generated text that appear in the reference text.
wi is the weight assigned to each n-gram precision.

Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE) is used for evaluating the quality of text summarization or document similarity. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and other features between the generated summary and the reference summary. Eqs. (2) and (3) present the formulations of ROUGE-N and ROUGE-L.

Broad Endorsement: The declaration has received endorse- ments from various organizations, fostering awareness and acceptance of responsible AI practices.

𝐶𝑁 : Count of overlapping N-grams, 𝑇 𝑁 : Count of N-grams in the reference summary, 𝐿𝐶𝑆: Longest Common Subsequence, 𝑇 𝑁𝑊 :
Total Number of Words in the reference summary
ROUGE-N calculates the precision of n-gram matches between the generated and reference summaries.
ROUGE-L measures the longest common subsequence between the generated and reference summaries.
Metric for Evaluation of Translation with Explicit Ordering (ME- TEOR) is another metric commonly used for evaluating machine trans- lation or text generation as shown in Eq. (4). It incorporates measures of precision, recall, and alignment errors, along with stemming and synonymy matching.
𝑀𝐸𝑇 𝐸𝑂𝑅 = (1 − 𝛼) ∗ 𝑃 + 𝛼 ∗ 𝑅 ∗ (1 − 𝑃 )	(4)
P: Precision measures the ratio of matching unigrams between the generated and reference texts.
R: Recall measures the ratio of matching unigrams in the gener- ated text against the reference text.
Penalty penalizes the generated text for incorrect word order or alignment errors.
𝛼 is a parameter that controls the trade-off between precision and
recall.

BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR are widely used metrics for evalu- ating machine translation and text summarization. They compare the model-generated output to human-generated reference texts.



Strengths

Quantitative Assessment: These metrics provide quantita- tive measures of model performance, facilitating objective evaluation.
Scalability: BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR can be automat- ically computed, enabling efficient evaluation across large datasets.
Weakness

Limitations in Capturing Quality: While useful for assessing certain aspects of text generation, these metrics may not capture all aspects of text quality, such as coherence or relevance.
Reference Dependency: The choice of reference texts may not always represent the only correct or best possible out- put.


Precision, recall, F1 score
Precision, recall, and the F1 score are evaluation metrics commonly used in information extraction, question answering, and other tasks. Precision measures the proportion of true positives among all identified entities as shown in Eq. (5), while recall measures the proportion of true positives among all actual positives as shown in Eq. (6). The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall as shown in Eq. (7).
𝑃 𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 = 	𝑇 𝑟𝑢𝑒𝑃 𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑠		(5)
𝑇 𝑟𝑢𝑒𝑃 𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑠 + 𝐹 𝑎𝑙𝑠𝑒𝑃 𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑠
𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙 =	𝑇 𝑟𝑢𝑒𝑃 𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑠	(6)
𝑇 𝑟𝑢𝑒𝑃 𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑠 + 𝐹 𝑎𝑙𝑠𝑒𝑁 𝑒𝑔𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑠
Perplexity
Perplexity is a measure of how well a probability model predicts a sample. In the context of language models, a lower perplexity score indicates better performance. Perplexity is a metric commonly used to evaluate the performance of language models, including conversational AI systems. It measures how well a language model predicts a given sequence of words. Perplexity is calculated based on the probability distribution of the language model. A lower perplexity score indicates that the language model can better predict the next word in a sequence and, therefore, has better performance. The formula for perplexity is as follows and shown in Eq. (8):
𝑃 𝑒𝑟𝑝𝑙𝑒𝑥𝑖𝑡𝑦 = 2− log 𝑃 (𝑤)	(8)
𝑃 (𝑤) represents the probability of the word sequence given by the
language model.
𝑁 represents the number of words in the sequence.
In essence, perplexity measures how surprised the language model would be to see the actual word sequence. A lower perplexity score suggests that the language model is more certain and accurate in its predictions. To use perplexity in evaluation, the language model is typically trained on a large dataset and then tested on a separate evaluation dataset. The perplexity score is calculated by applying the formula to the evaluation dataset. Lower perplexity scores indicate better performance and a better ability of the language model to predict the next word accurately. It is important to note that perplexity is often used as an internal evaluation metric during the training and fine-tuning of language models. While it provides a quantitative mea- sure of how well the model fits the training data, it may not always directly correlate with the overall quality or coherence of generated text. Therefore, perplexity is usually used in conjunction with other evaluation methods, such as human evaluation or task-specific metrics, to get a more comprehensive understanding of the language model’s performance.

𝐹 1𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 = 2 ∗ 𝑃 𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 ∗ 𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙

Interpretable Measure: Perplexity provides a single, inter- pretable measure of language model performance.
Automatic Computation: Perplexity can be calculated au- tomatically, enabling scalable evaluation across large datasets.
Weakness
Limited Text Quality Representation: Perplexity may not always correlate with qualitative measures of text quality, such as coherence or relevance.
Assumption of Data Distribution: It assumes that the test data follows the same distribution as the training data, which may not always hold true in real-world scenarios.

User feedback
User feedback provides a qualitative evaluation of a conversational AI system. It involves collecting feedback from users regarding their satisfaction, engagement, and overall experience with the system. Ta- ble 3 presents the comparison of various evaluation criteria. Here are some steps to effectively utilize user feedback for evaluation.
Design Feedback Collection Mechanisms: Implement mechanisms that allow users to provide feedback easily. This can include in-app rating systems, feedback forms, surveys, or even direct interaction with users through interviews or focus groups.
Define Evaluation Goals: Clearly define the evaluation goals and the specific aspects of the system that you want to assess with user feedback. This could include factors like system responsiveness, accuracy of responses, naturalness of conversation, or overall user satisfaction.


Table 3
Comparison of various evaluation criteria.


Gather Structured and Unstructured Feedback: Collect both struc- tured and unstructured feedback from users. Structured feedback can be in the form of ratings, rankings, or Likert scale responses, while unstructured feedback can include open-ended comments or suggestions. Structured feedback provides quantifiable metrics, while unstructured feedback captures nuanced insights.
Analyze Quantitative Metrics: Analyze structured feedback to gather quantitative metrics. This can involve calculating averages, aggregating ratings, or analyzing trends over time. These metrics can provide a quantifiable understanding of user satisfaction or specific aspects of the system’s performance.
Analyze Qualitative Insights: Analyze unstructured feedback to extract qualitative insights. This involves categorizing and sum- marizing user comments, identifying recurring themes or issues, and extracting actionable insights. Qualitative feedback provides rich context and helps identify areas for improvement.
Triangulate Feedback with Other Evaluation Measures: Combine user feedback with other evaluation measures, such as perfor- mance metrics or task-specific assessments. This helps gain a comprehensive understanding of the system’s performance and identifies correlations between user feedback and objective mea- sures.
Iterative Improvement: Use user feedback as a basis for itera- tive improvement. Identify areas where the system falls short or where user satisfaction can be enhanced, and prioritize enhance- ments accordingly. Regularly incorporate user feedback into the system’s development cycle to drive continuous improvement.
Address User Concerns: Actively address user concerns and is- sues raised through feedback. Communicate updates, improve- ments, or resolutions to users to demonstrate responsiveness and maintain user trust.
Engage Users in Co-creation: Engage users in the co-creation pro- cess by involving them in feedback-driven feature prioritization, design decisions, or beta testing. This fosters a sense of ownership, enhances user satisfaction, and ensures the system aligns with user expectations.
Strengths

User-Centric Assessment: User feedback captures the subjec- tive experience and satisfaction, providing valuable insights into system performance.
Comprehensive Evaluation: User feedback encompasses as- pects that may not be fully captured by quantitative metrics, such as the system’s naturalness and overall user experience.
Weakness

Resource-Intensive: Collecting and analyzing user feedback can be time-consuming and resource-intensive, requiring dedicated efforts.
Subjectivity and Variability: User feedback can be subjec- tive, and opinions may vary among users, making it chal- lenging to generalize the evaluation results.
New why metrics extend beyond traditional measures?
Traditional evaluation metrics for conversational AI systems, such as BLEU, ROUGE, and F1 scores, are extremely valuable for assessing the accuracy of generated responses based on reference responses. However, these measures do not fully capture some crucial aspects of conversation quality, such as context-sensitivity, dialogue coherence, user satisfaction, and the relevance of responses.
For instance, context-sensitivity refers to the AI’s ability to adapt its responses based on the conversational context. This aspect cannot be properly captured by traditional metrics, which evaluate responses independently of the conversational context. Therefore, we propose the Contextual Sensitivity Index (CSI) to quantitatively assess the AI’s ability to adjust its responses based on the conversation context.
Dialogue coherence is another important aspect often overlooked by traditional metrics. A conversation should maintain a logical and meaningful flow. To evaluate this, we propose a Dialogue Coher- ence Measure, which can quantify the degree of coherence in the conversation flow.
User satisfaction is one of the ultimate goals of any conversa- tional AI system. Traditional metrics often fall short in capturing the subjective experience of users. By incorporating user feedback and human evaluation into our framework, we can gather insights into user satisfaction and the perceived quality of conversations.
Lastly, the relevance of responses is another crucial aspect. A re- sponse may be grammatically correct and similar to reference responses (resulting in high scores in traditional metrics) but may still be irrel- evant or inappropriate in a given context. To capture this, we pro- pose a Relevance Measure, which assesses the pertinence of generated responses.
While we recognize that some of these measures have been used in other contexts or for specific tasks, our proposed framework integrates them into a comprehensive evaluation system for conversational AI. The combination of these measures provides a more nuanced and holis- tic evaluation of the AI’s performance, filling gaps left by traditional metrics. We hope this clarifies the need for these ‘‘beyond traditional’’ measures in our proposed framework.
Let us delve deeper into why the proposed metrics extend beyond traditional measures in the context of evaluating conversational AI systems.
Contextual Sensitivity Index (CSI): Traditional metrics are in- herently context-agnostic. They measure the linguistic closeness of the generated response to a pre-determined ‘‘gold standard’’ response. However, this fails to capture an essential attribute of natural conversations — the context-dependency. Conversations are not merely exchanges of information but are deeply influ- enced by the context they are embedded in. Therefore, it is crucial to assess a model’s capability of being sensitive to the context, a factor traditional measures do not address. CSI, as we propose, quantifies this context sensitivity. It can detect if the model appropriately adjusts its responses to changes in the context, such as alterations in topic, sentiment, or nuances introduced by the user. For instance, in a support chat scenario, if the user goes from asking about a product’s feature to expressing frustration about it,



the model should adjust its responses accordingly, demonstrating empathy and providing assistance.
The CSI might be a normalized score that compares a model’s responses in different contexts.
Here, Xi could represent different aspects of user feedback (like satisfaction, understanding, helpfulness), and wi could be their corresponding weights.
Strengths

𝑓 (Contextual Response Variation)
𝐶𝑆𝐼 =
𝑔(Contextual Stimuli Variation)
(9)
It is a direct measure of user satisfaction, which is the ultimate goal of a conversational AI.

Here, f() could be a function that measures the degree of variation in the model’s responses given a change in the contextual stimuli. g() could be a function quantifying the variation in the contextual stimuli.
Strengths
CSI can capture a model’s ability to adapt its responses to the changes in context.
It focuses on a crucial aspect of conversational AI that traditional metrics overlook: context sensitivity.
Weakness
Determining an appropriate measure of ‘‘contextual varia- tion’’ might be challenging.
Some elements of context might be subtle or hard to quan- tify.
Dialogue Coherence Measure: Conversations are not random sequences of exchanges but follow a certain logic or flow. They are coherent narratives. While traditional metrics might capture fluency or grammatical correctness, they are ill-equipped to as- sess the conversational coherence over extended dialogues. We propose a dialogue coherence measure that goes beyond sentence- level assessment and looks at the conversation as a whole, from the start to the current utterance, capturing both local and global coherence.
It can capture aspects like naturalness, empathy, and cre- ativity that automated metrics may miss.
Weakness
User feedback might be subjective and could vary widely between individuals.
Collecting and analyzing user feedback can be resource- intensive.
	Relevance Measure: Linguistic closeness to a reference response does not necessarily equate to relevance. A response could be grammatically correct and align well with a reference response yet be entirely irrelevant to the conversation at hand. Therefore, a relevance measure is crucial to assess how well a model’s responses align with the current context and the user’s needs and expectations. It goes beyond the myopic view of traditional metrics and looks at the bigger picture — the conversation’s goal. The Relevance Measure can assess how closely the AI’s responses align with the content and purpose of the preceding conversa- tional turns. It is crucial to ensure that the AI does not deviate significantly from the topic, which would make the conversation feel disjointed and reduce user satisfaction.
This measure assesses how closely the AI’s responses align with the content and intent of the preceding conversational turns.
Number of Relevant Responses

This measure could assess both local (adjacent turn-to-turn) and

global (entire conversation) coherence.
Coherence Score = 𝛼 ∗ LC + 𝛽 ∗ GC	(10)
LC: Local coherence could be quantified as the semantic similarity between adjacent utterances.
GC: Global coherence could be quantified by considering the semantic drift over the course of the conversation.
Strengths
It takes into account the entire conversational flow, not just individual utterances.
It can capture the logical consistency and progression of a conversation.
Weakness
Deciding on suitable weights (𝛼 and 𝛽) for local and global
coherence might be tricky.
Semantic drift computation could be computationally heavy for long conversations.
User /eedback and Human Evaluation: Traditional metrics are quantitative, automated, and lack the human touch. They do not factor in the user’s perception of the conversation or subjective
Strengths
It directly evaluates how well the AI maintains the context and stays on topic.
It can prevent the AI from generating off-topic responses, which are a common problem in chatbot conversations.
Weakness
The definition of ‘‘relevance’’ can be subjective and may differ across various conversational contexts.
Some conversations might require the AI to shift topics appropriately, which this metric might penalize.
Task Success Rate (TSR): The Task Success Rate is a vital metric when conversational AI systems are designed to perform specific tasks, such as answering customer inquiries, booking appoint- ments, or making reservations. This metric provides a direct measure of the system’s ability to complete these tasks correctly and is a clear indicator of the system’s practical value to users. TSR is a crucial measure for task-oriented conversational AI sys- tems. It provides a direct measure of the AI’s ability to correctly complete the assigned tasks.

experience, which is crucial as the ultimate aim of conversational AI is to engage and assist humans effectively. This is where user feedback and human evaluation play a key role. Users can provide

insights into factors traditional metrics cannot perceive: Did they find the conversation engaging? Did the AI understand and satisfy their intent? Did they find the response natural, empathetic, or creative, even if it deviated from standard responses?
This metric could be an aggregate score of different facets of user feedback.
User Score = 𝛴[𝑤𝑖 ∗ 𝑋𝑖]	(11)
It directly measures the system’s ability to perform its in- tended function.
It is straightforward to calculate and understand.
Weakness
The definition of ‘‘task success’’ can vary widely across different types of tasks and may be hard to standardize.

It does not capture the quality of the system’s interactions with users outside the context of task completion.
In summary, these metrics and methods stretch beyond the tradi- tional metrics’ capacity to evaluate a conversation’s quality, offering a more comprehensive understanding of the model’s conversational com- petence. While some of these measures might have been used in some contexts, their use in evaluating conversational AI is relatively new. Their integration into our proposed framework represents a major step forward in the development of more holistic, nuanced, and user-centric evaluation methodologies.

Insight of benchmarks, standards and evaluations of ChatGPT

Differences between ChatGPT and other AI models

Benchmarks, standards, and evaluation criteria for ChatGPT may differ from those used for other GPT or deep learning models due to the specific nature of conversational AI systems. Here’s how they differ [31,32].
Benchmarks: ChatGPT benchmarks focus on assessing the per- formance and capabilities of the model in conversational sce- narios, emphasizing factors like interactivity, coherence, and context maintenance. Traditional benchmarks for other GPT or deep learning models may focus on specific tasks like machine translation, question answering, or sentiment analysis, with less emphasis on the dynamic and interactive nature of conversations.
Standards: Standards for ChatGPT encompass guidelines and principles specific to conversational AI, addressing ethical consid- erations, user experience, and responsible behavior in interactive dialogue systems. Standards for other GPT or deep learning mod- els may focus on general ethical guidelines, technical performance metrics, or data handling practices, but may not explicitly address the complexities and challenges unique to conversational AI.
Evaluation Criteria: Evaluation criteria for ChatGPT emphasize aspects such as context awareness, persona consistency, user sat- isfaction, and relevance in multi-turn conversations. Evaluation criteria for other GPT or deep learning models may focus on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score, typically measured on specific tasks or datasets.
The key distinction lies in the specific requirements and charac- teristics of conversational AI systems like ChatGPT, which necessitate tailored benchmarks, standards, and evaluation criteria. Conversational AI places emphasis on interactivity, contextual understanding, user experience, and ethical considerations that differ from the task-specific evaluation used for other deep learning models. Here’s an expanded comparison table that provides more details and parameters for com- paring benchmarks, standards, and evaluation criteria between Chat- GPT and other GPT or deep learning models. Table 4 shows the comparison of benchmarks, standards, and evaluation Criteria between ChatGPT and other AI models.
Key issues in evaluation criteria

We present some existing challenges in the evaluation of conversa- tional AI systems like ChatGPT, along with specific points that highlight the complexities and considerations involved [33].

	Ethical Considerations: Protecting user privacy and responsibly handling sensitive information, avoiding the generation of offen- sive, harmful, or misleading content, and ensuring transparency in communicating the system’s capabilities and limitations.
Evaluation Metrics: Developing comprehensive metrics that cap- ture the nuances of conversational AI, incorporating both quanti- tative and qualitative measures to assess system performance, and striking a balance between different evaluation criteria to provide a holistic assessment.
User Engagement and Satisfaction: Maintaining user engage- ment throughout a conversation, providing responses that are not only accurate but also engaging and natural, and ensuring user satisfaction by meeting their expectations and preferences.
Robustness and Error Handling: Handling out-of-scope queries and gracefully responding to unsupported requests, detecting and addressing cases where the model generates incorrect or nonsen- sical responses, and effectively managing errors or misinterpreta- tions during the conversation.
Scalability and Generalization: Ensuring that the system’s per- formance generalizes well to unseen scenarios, scaling the system to handle high volumes of concurrent conversations, and eval- uating its performance on diverse datasets and real-world use cases.
User-Centered Design: Incorporating user feedback and involv- ing users in the evaluation process, designing systems that adapt to individual user preferences and needs, and striking a balance between system capabilities and user expectations to optimize the user experience.
Real-Time Interaction: Enabling fast and seamless responses in real-time conversations, minimizing latency to ensure timely interaction for a smooth user experience, and managing the com- putational requirements for real-time response generation.



Adaptability aspects for ChatGPT

Achieving adaptability in the creation of new benchmarks, stan- dards, and evaluation criteria for ChatGPT involves considering the dynamic nature of the field, evolving requirements, and emerging challenges. Here are some key aspects to consider for achieving adapt- ability [34].
/lexibility in Design: To promote adaptability, benchmarks, standards, and evaluation criteria should be designed with flexi- bility in mind. This includes accommodating future changes and advancements by allowing for iterative updates and revisions based on emerging research, user feedback, and evolving needs. Incorporating modularity in the design enables easy addition or modification of evaluation components as the field progresses.
Community Collaboration: Collaboration among researchers, developers, and stakeholders is essential for adaptability. Foster an environment of open discussions, knowledge sharing, and par- ticipation to collectively define benchmarks, standards, and eval- uation criteria. Establish community-driven processes to gather input, incorporate diverse perspectives, and validate the proposed criteria, ensuring that they reflect the needs and requirements of the wider community.
Engagement with User /eedback: User feedback plays a crucial role in creating adaptable benchmarks, standards, and evaluation criteria. Actively seek and incorporate user perspectives to ensure that the criteria align with their needs, expectations, and desired outcomes. Regularly assess and integrate user feedback to refine and update the benchmarks and evaluation protocols, making them more relevant and effective.
Consideration of Emerging Challenges: Staying informed about emerging challenges and novel use cases in conversational AI is essential for adaptability. Continuously evaluate the relevance of existing benchmarks and standards, identifying gaps and new requirements.

However, strike a balance between consistency and flexibility to accommodate diverse use cases, domains, and emerging challenges. Allow for customization and adaptation of evaluation criteria based on specific application requirements, enabling the benchmarks and standards to cater to a wide range of needs and contexts.

Proposed framework

Our proposed evaluation framework for ChatGPT is a six-layered and comprehensive model that accounts for a wide range of evaluation criteria from task-specific to human-based assessments. This robust evaluation framework is necessary to ensure that the AI system is ca- pable of understanding and responding to human queries, maintaining
coherence, providing relevant and accurate responses, and upholding ethical considerations. Here is a deeper dive into each layer of the evaluation framework.

Background
The following section presents a theoretical proposal for a bench- marking and evaluation framework specifically developed for ChatGPT. At present, this is a conceptual proposition and not a hands-on im- plementation. We have formulated the proposed framework with the intention of laying the groundwork for future practical applications and developments in the field of Conversational AI. Our framework comprises of diverse evaluation tasks and standards, which are rep- resentative of a wide array of potential use cases. We acknowledge that the scope of Conversational AI is vast and continuously evolving; hence, our proposal is not exhaustive but focuses on the most critical aspects of this field. We believe that our proposed framework, with its structured evaluation tasks and progressive standards, could offer valu- able insights to guide the responsible and effective development and deployment of conversational models like ChatGPT. We also emphasize that our framework is inherently adaptable to incorporate future ad- vancements and emerging trends in AI. With this flexible design, it can continue to serve as a reliable guide, reflecting and addressing the ever- changing landscape of AI technologies. Fig. 1 presents the architecture of the 6-layered proposed framework.

A multi-dimensional approach of proposed framework
Task-Oriented Benchmarks: These are tasks specifically de- signed to test various capabilities of ChatGPT. This category is broken down into further subsections. Task-specific bench- marks focus on evaluating the performance of a conversational AI system on specific predefined tasks or domains. These bench- marks are designed to assess the system’s ability to understand and generate responses relevant to the given task. Examples of task-specific benchmarks include question-answering datasets like SQuAD or translation datasets like Workshop on Machine Translation (WMT).
/actual Understanding: Tasks testing the ability to under- stand and generate factual information. For instance, ques- tions about historical events, scientific concepts, or general knowledge.
Contextual Understanding: Tasks to evaluate the model’s ability to grasp and maintain context over a conversation. An example could be a sequence of questions where each question relies on information from the previous one.
Coherence: Tasks to assess whether the model maintains coherence in long responses or over a long conversation. Ambiguity Resolution: Tasks that test the system’s ability to handle ambiguous queries and requests.
Measuring task-oriented benchmarks can involve following tech- niques.
Accuracy: Measure the percentage of correctly answered questions or tasks.
	/1 Score: Compute the harmonic mean of precision and recall, particularly used in question answering benchmarks.
	BLEU: Measure the quality of machine-generated transla- tions by comparing them to reference translations.
	ROUGE: Assess the quality of machine-generated sum- maries by comparing them to reference summaries.
	METEOR: Evaluate the quality of machine-generated trans- lations by considering precision, recall, and alignment.
Strength

They provide a clear and measurable evaluation criterion based on the successful completion of the task.
These benchmarks help assess the system’s ability to under- stand and generate responses relevant to the given task.
They enable direct comparison and evaluation of different systems on the same task.
Weakness

Selecting the right set of task-oriented benchmarks can be challenging due to the diverse range of tasks and domains.
It may be difficult to capture the full complexity of real- world tasks within a benchmark, leading to potential limi- tations in generalizability.
Designing high-quality task-specific datasets for benchmark- ing can be time-consuming and resource-intensive.
Real-World Application Benchmarks: These involve creating real-world scenarios for evaluation. Such benchmarks aim to evaluate the system’s performance in real-world scenarios, where
the conversations are more diverse and dynamic. These bench- marks simulate realistic conversational settings and evaluate the system’s ability to handle complex interactions, maintain con- text, and provide appropriate responses. Real-world application benchmarks often involve more open-ended conversations, such as customer support dialogues or interactive chat sessions. A few examples include.
	Customer Service Simulations: ChatGPT should be able to manage a customer’s request, provide accurate information, and offer a satisfactory resolution. Evaluation can be based on success rate, resolution time, and customer satisfaction.
	Education and Tutoring Scenarios: Tasks could involve explaining complex concepts, answering educational queri- es, and interacting in a pedagogically effective manner.
Measuring real-world application benchmarks can involve follow- ing techniques.
Human Evaluation: Conduct manual assessments where human judges rate the quality of the system’s responses based on criteria such as relevance, fluency, and appropri- ateness.
	User /eedback: Collect feedback from real users who interact with the system in real-world scenarios, such as customer support or chat applications.
	Contextual Coherence: Measure the system’s ability to maintain context and coherence throughout a conversa- tion by evaluating the flow and continuity of dialogue ex- changes.
	Relevance: Assess the relevance of the system’s responses to the specific user queries or prompts in a real-world context.
	User Satisfaction: Gather user ratings or feedback to gauge their overall satisfaction and experience with the system.
In determining representative real-world tasks or applications to serve as benchmarks, we propose a three-pronged approach:
	User-Driven Selection: The first step involves identify- ing the primary ways users interact with ChatGPT. This involves extensive user studies, surveys, and data analysis to discern the most common and critical use-cases. For instance, if most users engage with ChatGPT for drafting emails or generating text, then benchmarks should include tasks that directly assess these functions. On the other hand, if users frequently engage in conversational dialogues with ChatGPT, the benchmarks should reflect tasks that mea- sure its performance in conversational understanding and generation.
∗ Survey and User Studies: To identify the main inter- actions users have with ChatGPT, we can conduct ex- tensive surveys and user studies. These could involve a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods. For instance, users could be asked to rank various use-cases of ChatGPT according to their frequency of usage. They could also be invited to participate in focus groups or interviews to share their experiences and expectations in more detail.
∗ Data Analysis: ChatGPT interaction data (while re- specting user privacy and data protection norms) could be analyzed to identify common patterns and tasks. Techniques such as data mining, clustering, and se- quence analysis could help identify frequent user in- teractions. Natural language processing techniques can also be applied to the data to extract patterns and insights, providing a rich source of user-driven tasks.



∗ Advanced Analytical Techniques: Employing meth- ods such as sentiment analysis, latent semantic anal- ysis, or topic modeling to the user interaction data can reveal not only common tasks but also users’ attitudes towards those tasks. Additionally, machine learning techniques such as association rule learn- ing can help discover relationships between different types of interactions, revealing more complex tasks or task sequences.
∗ User Persona Creation: By developing user personas, or representations of different types of users based on behavior patterns, needs, motivations, and goals, we can derive an understanding of the needs and wants of different user groups. This will guide us towards representative tasks that cater to a wide range of users.
Diversity of Benchmarks: The evaluation should not be limited to one or two tasks that represent the most common uses. It should include a wide variety of tasks that measure different aspects of the system’s capabilities. This could in- clude tasks like question answering (to test understanding), text generation (to test creative abilities), summarization (to test conciseness), and translation (to test language ca- pabilities). By selecting diverse tasks, we can create a more holistic view of ChatGPT’s performance and versatility.
∗ Cognitive Task Diversity: The selected tasks should not only reflect user interactions but also encompass a wide spectrum of cognitive capabilities. For instance, question answering tasks measure the system’s un- derstanding and reasoning abilities. In contrast, text generation tasks test the system’s creativity and co- herence. Having a diverse set of tasks would ensure a comprehensive evaluation.
∗ Domain-Specific Benchmarks: Given the wide- ranging applications of ChatGPT, it is also crucial to include domain-specific tasks. For instance, if Chat- GPT is being used for drafting legal documents or medical prescriptions, including benchmarks relevant to those fields would provide a more accurate perfor- mance measure.
∗ Multimodal Tasks: With the advancement of AI, many chatbots have evolved to process multiple types of input (like text, voice, image, etc.). Including multi- modal tasks in the benchmark set can help evaluate the AI’s capabilities across different modalities.
∗ Inter-task dependencies: In real-world applications, a conversation often involves a series of interdepen- dent tasks. Therefore, considering tasks in isolation may not fully represent the AI’s capabilities. Including compound tasks, which require the completion of one task to start the next, can provide more comprehensive insights.
Edge Case Inclusion: Real-world use often involves sce- narios that were not explicitly catered to during system design. These ‘‘edge cases’’ are critical for evaluating a sys- tem’s robustness and generalization ability. For instance, the benchmarks could include dialogues that involve ambiguous references or require extensive world knowledge. It could also involve multilingual conversations, or conversations that require the system to handle sensitive topics tactfully. By including these tasks in the benchmarks, we can assess how well ChatGPT adapts to less-than-ideal or unexpected scenarios.
∗ Ethical and Sensitive Scenarios: Including tasks in- volving sensitive topics is crucial in assessing how the AI handles such situations. This could involve creating hypothetical scenarios where the user brings up a potentially distressing topic, and assessing how well the AI responds.
∗ Handling Ambiguity: Tasks should also be designed to measure the AI’s ability to handle ambiguity. This could involve dialogues that contain ambiguous ref- erences, require inference from context, or involve languages other than English. Assessing these abil- ities would provide valuable insights into the AI’s robustness and ability to generalize from its training.
∗ Stress Testing: This involves testing the AI system under extreme conditions, such as rapid-fire question- ing, nonsensical input, or challenging factual ques- tions. These tests can reveal the system’s resilience and ability to handle unexpected situations.
∗ Long Conversations: Including tasks that involve long conversations can test the AI’s ability to maintain context and coherence over an extended interaction. This is crucial in real-world applications, where con- versations often go beyond simple question-answering.
Therefore, the process of selecting representative tasks as benchmarks goes beyond merely picking the most com- mon use-cases. It involves an in-depth understanding of the system’s intended use, its capabilities, and potential real- world scenarios it might encounter. By employing such a comprehensive approach, we ensure that the benchmarks chosen provide a detailed, holistic, and robust evaluation of ChatGPT’s performance.

Ethical and Moral Evaluation: To assess the ethical and moral aspects of a conversational AI system, various techniques can be employed. Bias analysis involves analyzing the system’s training data and generated responses to identify potential biases related to gender, race, religion, or other protected attributes. Fairness metrics like disparate impact analysis, demographic parity, or equalized odds can be used to evaluate the system’s responses across different demographic groups and identify any disparities or biases. Privacy assessment involves analyzing how the system handles user data, ensuring compliance with privacy regulations such as GDPR or HIPAA. Ethical alignment frameworks like Ope- nAI’s ethical principles or IEEE’s Ethically Aligned Design can be used to evaluate the system’s adherence to ethical guidelines and principles such as fairness, transparency, accountability, and avoiding harm. This could include.
	Bias Detection Analyzing the system’s outputs to identify any potential biased behavior.
	Privacy Protection: Evaluating the system’s ability to avoid sensitive topics, not to store or misuse private user data.
Responsible Data Handling: Ensuring the AI does not manipulate or misuse data.
Various evaluation techniques can be imposed to evaluate ethical and moral aspects as follows.
Bias Analysis: Conduct an in-depth examination of the system’s training data and generated responses to identify potential biases in terms of gender, race, religion, or other protected attributes. This can involve statistical analysis, correlation studies, and fairness metrics to quantify the presence and impact of biases.
	/airness Metrics: Utilize fairness metrics, such as disparate impact analysis, demographic parity, or equalized odds, to evaluate the fairness of the system’s responses across different demographic groups. These metrics can help iden- tify and address any disparities or biases in the system’s behavior.
	Privacy Assessment: Perform a privacy impact assessment to analyze how the system handles user data, including data collection, storage, and sharing practices. Evaluate whether the system adheres to privacy regulations and guidelines, such as GDPR or HIPAA, and ensure that user privacy is protected.
	Ethical Alignment /rameworks: Assess the system’s ad- herence to ethical guidelines and frameworks, such as Ope- nAI’s ethical principles, IEEE’s Ethically Aligned Design, or the Montreal Declaration.

Weakness
Ethical evaluation may involve subjective judgments, mak- ing it challenging to define and enforce standardized crite- ria.
Assessing ethical aspects often requires domain-specific ex- pertise and understanding of societal norms and values.
Evaluating the long-term societal impact of conversational AI systems can be difficult, as ethical considerations evolve over time.
User /eedback and Human Evaluation: Collecting user feed- back is crucial in evaluating conversational AI systems. Surveys and questionnaires can be designed and distributed to gather feedback on aspects like user satisfaction, usefulness, natural- ness, and perceived biases. User ratings can be obtained by al- lowing users to rate individual responses based on relevance, fluency, coherence, and appropriateness. Conducting preference tests enables users to compare and rank different system re- sponses, revealing their preferences and identifying the most



desirable outputs. Human judgment can be employed by em- ploying human judges to evaluate the system’s responses against predefined criteria, assessing coherence, relevance, naturalness, and adherence to ethical and moral standards. Various metrics can be used.
	User Satisfaction: Measuring whether the user is satisfied with the interaction. Utility: Checking if the system provides useful and accurate information.
	Understandability: Assessing whether the user under- stands the system’s responses.
Evaluation of user feedback and human involvement can me done in following ways.
Surveys and Questionnaires: Design and distribute sur- veys or questionnaires to collect user feedback on various aspects of the conversational AI system, including satisfac- tion, usefulness, naturalness, and perceived biases. Use Lik- ert scales, rating scales, or open-ended questions to gather quantitative and qualitative feedback.
	User Ratings: Allow users to rate individual responses generated by the system based on criteria such as relevance, fluency, coherence, and appropriateness. Aggregate these ratings to measure the overall quality of the system’s output.
	Comparative Evaluation: Conduct preference tests where users are presented with different system responses and asked to compare and rank them based on preferred quali- ties. This helps identify user preferences and determine the most desirable responses.
	Human Judgment: Employ human judges who evaluate the system’s responses based on predefined evaluation cri- teria. Judges assess aspects such as coherence, relevance to the user’s query, naturalness, and adherence to ethical and moral standards.

Reinforcement Learning-based Evaluation: Reinforcement learning techniques can be utilized to evaluate and improve conversational AI systems. Defining reward models that cap- ture the desired behavior and objectives of the system guides the reinforcement learning process. Offline evaluation involves simulating or replaying user interactions to assess the system’s performance using historical dialogues or synthetic user interac- tions. This helps evaluate the quality of generated responses based
on predefined evaluation metrics. Online evaluation involves deploying the system in a live setting and collecting real-time user feedback. Through techniques like active learning, users can provide feedback on specific responses, which is then used to update the model and improve its performance over time. It uses the following criteria.
Positive /eedback: If the model performs well on a task, it is rewarded, encouraging such behavior in the future.
Negative /eedback: If the model performs poorly or makes a mistake, it is penalized, discouraging such behavior in the future.
Measuring the reinforcement learning-based evaluation can be done in below mentioned ways.
Reward Models: Define reward models that capture desired behavior and objectives for the conversational AI system. These reward models guide the reinforcement learning pro- cess, allowing the system to learn and improve its responses based on the feedback received.

The trial-and-error learning process of reinforcement learn- ing may lead to unintended consequences and potential ethical concerns.
It may be difficult to interpret and explain the inner work- ings of the system trained through reinforcement learning.

Workloads for benchmark
Determining the precise number of workloads or the types of work- loads sufficient for comprehensive benchmarking is a complex task. In an ideal scenario, benchmarks should cover a broad spectrum of scenarios that a system could encounter. However, it is impractical and nearly impossible to include every possible workload due to the inherent diversity of real-world interactions and applications. Hence, we propose a balanced and representative selection of workloads.
Task-Specific Workloads: A good starting point is to include a variety of task-specific workloads that reflect different types of



tasks a conversational AI might be expected to perform. For in- stance, this could include tasks such as booking a flight, setting an appointment, providing a weather update, and answering trivia questions. This can test the system’s ability to understand and respond to specific intents.
Domain-Specific Workloads: Additionally, benchmarks should incorporate workloads specific to various domains like health- care, finance, and education, to name a few. Different domains have unique language patterns, terminologies, and contextual nuances, providing a rigorous test for the system’s adaptability and contextual understanding.
General Conversation Workloads: Finally, the workload should also include more free-form conversational interactions that are not tied to a specific task or domain. This can help evaluate the system’s ability to carry on a meaningful, coherent, and engaging conversation.
The combination of these workloads would be determined by the target application of the AI model. For example, a conversational AI designed for customer service might have a higher focus on task-specific and domain-specific (i.e., customer service-related) workloads, whereas a general-purpose AI might require a more balanced mix. The key here is to ensure that the chosen workloads are representative and challenging enough to cover a wide range of scenarios the system could face, yet still feasible to be implemented in practice. The exact number and selection of workloads would vary based on these consid- erations. However, it is essential to continuously update and expand these workloads as new tasks, domains, and use-cases emerge.
When determining the number and types of workloads that are sufficient for benchmarking, it is important to strike a balance between comprehensiveness and feasibility. While it is indeed challenging and impractical to cover every possible workload as a benchmark, there are strategies to ensure an effective and representative evaluation.
Diversity of Workloads: Instead of aiming for exhaustive cover- age, focus on selecting workloads that represent a diverse range of tasks, domains, and conversational scenarios. This can include a mix of common real-world tasks, industry-specific use cases, and challenging or complex scenarios.
Importance and Relevance: Prioritize workloads that are widely used or have significant practical importance. Consider tasks that are commonly encountered in real-world applications, as well as those that pose specific challenges or require sophisticated language understanding and generation capabilities.
Coverage of Key Domains: Identify key domains or industries where conversational AI systems are expected to perform well. This can include healthcare, customer support, education, e- commerce, and others. Select representative workloads from these domains to evaluate the system’s performance in domain-specific contexts.
Scalability: Consider the scalability of workloads. While it may not be feasible to cover every possible variation, ensure that the selected workloads cover a sufficient range of complexities, including variations in conversational styles, user intents, and system responses.
Balancing Breadth and Depth: Aim for a balance between breadth and depth in workload coverage. While it is important to cover a wide range of workloads, ensure that each workload is evaluated in sufficient detail to capture nuances and intricacies specific to that task.
User-Centric Approach: Incorporate user feedback and prefer- ences in workload selection. Consider the tasks that users com- monly seek assistance with or find challenging. This can help identify workloads that align with user needs and expectations.
Continuous Evaluation: Recognize that the landscape of work- loads and user requirements is dynamic. As new tasks and do- mains emerge, continuously evaluate and update the benchmark suite to reflect evolving demands.
Integration of the metrics with proposed framework
The integration of these newly proposed metrics within your exist- ing framework adds nuanced, context-aware dimensions to the eval- uation of conversational AI models like ChatGPT. These proposed metrics—Contextual Sensitivity Index (CSI), Dialogue Coherence Mea- sure, Relevance Measure, and Task Success Rate (TSR), along with traditional metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, F1 score, precision, recall, and perplexity—offer an extensive spectrum of evaluation crite- ria.
Contextual Sensitivity Index (CSI): The CSI serves as a ther- mometer for the AI’s ability to perceive the ebb and flow of the conversational context. In customer service scenarios, the AI’s responses should not only be accurate but also empathetic, particularly if the customer is showing signs of frustration. In chatbot applications for mental health support, the weightage of CSI could be significantly higher, as understanding and adjusting to the user’s emotional context is vital.
	Relevance Measure: Ensuring relevance in AI responses is cru- cial for maintaining user engagement and satisfaction. For in- stance, in a digital assistant application where the user asks for weather updates, a response about the latest news headlines, al- though perfect in grammar and syntax, is irrelevant. Applications that demand direct answers to user queries, such as virtual assis- tants or customer support bots, should assign a higher weightage to this metric.
Task Success Rate (TSR): In task-oriented applications, the sys- tem’s competency is directly linked to how successfully it per- forms a particular task. In a restaurant reservation bot, TSR would measure how accurately the bot processes user input (date, time, venue, etc.) to complete the booking. The higher the success rate, the more reliable the bot is perceived by the users. Applications that are built to perform specific tasks should assign a higher weightage to TSR.
Dialogue Coherence Measure: This metric is essential for ap- plications involving multi-turn dialogues. For instance, a tutoring bot should follow the topic discussed, maintain the continuity of ideas, and avoid abrupt topic switches. A higher weightage could be given to this measure in scenarios involving extended dialogues, such as tutoring, therapy, or general conversation bots.
	User Satisfaction: This could involve various parameters such as the AI’s response speed, relevance, coherence, and polite- ness. Depending on user feedback and the specific use case, the importance of these parameters may differ. For example, in time-sensitive applications, like customer support, users might value response speed more, while in therapy bots, users may value politeness and coherence more. Weights should be adjusted accordingly to align with user preferences.
Traditional Metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, /1 score, Pre- cision, Recall, Perplexity): Each of these metrics offers different insights about the linguistic capabilities of the model. For exam- ple, in a language translation bot, metrics like BLEU and METEOR would have higher weightage as they measure how close the translated text is to the reference translation. However, in a question-answering bot, Precision and Recall may have higher weightage as they measure how accurately the bot retrieves the relevant information.

Imposing Weights on Metrics
In order to compute a comprehensive score, each metric could be normalized to a standard scale, perhaps between 0 and 1 or 0 to 100, to allow for comparison across different measures. Following this, the overall score could be computed as a weighted average of these normalized scores. The weights assigned to each metric could be decided based on several factors such as the specific use case of the model, user feedback, or empirical evidence from pilot studies.



For instance, if the ChatGPT model is primarily used for customer support, higher weight might be given to TSR, Relevance Measure, and CSI, since these would be critical for the successful operation in a customer service environment. Conversely, if the model is being used for creative writing or storytelling, Dialogue Coherence Measure and traditional language generation metrics (like BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR) might receive higher weighting. Furthermore, these weights could be dynamically adjusted based on user feedback. For instance, if users consistently indicate that they value relevance and coherence over perfect grammatical correctness, the weights for Relevance Measure and Dialogue Coherence Measure could be increased, and weights for traditional metrics like BLEU and ROUGE could be decreased.
Assigning different weights to metrics in your benchmarking frame- work requires careful consideration of the specifics of the AI model, its application area, and its user base. Here’s how this process might unfold:

Understand the Use Case: The primary use case of the AI model should be the first determinant of weights. For instance, if you are evaluating a customer service chatbot, you might assign more weight to the Task Success Rate (TSR) and Relevance Measure, as these aspects are crucial for solving customer issues. On the other hand, a therapeutic chatbot might require a higher emphasis on the Contextual Sensitivity Index (CSI) and Dialogue Coherence Measure.
Consider User Preferences and /eedback: Feedback from users can provide insights into which aspects of the AI model are most important to them. Regular user surveys, user-testing sessions, and analyses of user reviews and ratings can help you understand what users value in the AI’s performance. This understanding can guide the weight assignment. For example, if users particularly appreciate coherent and context-sensitive responses, assign higher weights to the CSI and Dialogue Coherence Measure.
Leverage Domain Expert Opinions: Domain experts can pro- vide valuable guidance on assigning weights. For instance, a linguistics expert might suggest a higher weightage for tradi- tional NLP metrics like BLEU and ROUGE for language learning applications. Meanwhile, a psychologist might advise prioritiz- ing ethical considerations and context sensitivity for therapeutic applications.
Use a Data-Driven Approach: Machine learning techniques can be applied to automatically adjust the weights based on empirical evidence. Regression analysis, for example, could be used to find the correlation between different metrics and overall user satisfac- tion. The metrics most strongly correlated with satisfaction would receive higher weights.
Iterative Refinement: The initial weights should not be set in stone; they should be subject to regular reassessment and refine- ment. Continually analyzing user feedback, monitoring changes in user behavior, and staying attuned to advancements in the AI field will provide the data necessary to adjust weights over time, ensuring the benchmarking framework remains effective and relevant.

The goal of assigning weights is to tailor the evaluation frame- work to provide the most meaningful assessment of an AI model’s performance in its intended application. Hence, this process must be thoughtful, flexible, and continuously evolving. Ultimately, the key is to maintain a level of flexibility and adaptability in your framework. The ability to adapt the weights based on these factors will ensure that your benchmarking framework remains relevant and effective in evaluating and improving the performance of conversational AI models like ChatGPT.

Use of proposed framework for intelligent evaluation
By "Intelligent Evaluation’’, we refer to the process of incorporating multi-faceted, nuanced methods to capture the depth of ChatGPT’s performance via the proposed framework. This involves going be- yond traditional measures, leveraging user feedback, and employing reinforcement learning for evaluation.
Metrics Beyond Traditional Measures While traditional metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, and F1 score provide a quantitative measure of system performance, they may not fully capture aspects such as context-sensitivity, dialogue coherence, and relevance of re- sponses. We propose to supplement these with metrics that focus on evaluating dialogue quality and contextual understanding. For example, one could use the Contextual Sensitivity Index (CSI), a metric we propose that quantifies the degree to which a model’s responses vary appropriately with changes to the conversational context.
	User /eedback and Human Evaluation: This involves collect- ing qualitative feedback from users regarding their interaction with ChatGPT, which can provide insights into user satisfaction and the perceived quality of conversations. This can be carried out through user studies or surveys post-interaction.
Application of Reinforcement Learning in Evaluation: In re- inforcement learning-based evaluation, an agent (in this case, ChatGPT) learns to make decisions by taking actions in an en- vironment to maximize some notion of cumulative reward. For instance, a dialogue manager could be trained to optimize the cu- mulative reward of maintaining user engagement and minimizing harmful or inappropriate responses. We outline a reinforcement learning-based evaluation pipeline in Algorithm 1 and provide implementation details to aid in reproducibility.



Challenges and future directions for benchmarking, standards, and evaluation for ChatGPT

In this section, we discuss the key challenges and future directions in benchmarking, standards, and evaluation for ChatGPT [35,36].

Key challenges

We have examined prominent bench- marks, including GLUE, SuperGLUE, SQuAD, CoQA, Persona-Chat, DSTC, BIG-Bench, HELM, and MMLU, and assessed their strengths and limitations in evaluating ChatGPT’s performance. These benchmarks offer standardized tasks and evaluation metrics to measure the system’s



contextual understanding, coherence in generating responses, and con- versational relevance. To ensure ethical and responsible development, we have proposed adaptive standards aligned with recognized frame- works such as OpenAI’s principles, IEEE’s Ethically Aligned Design, the Montreal Declaration, and Partnership on AI’s Tenets. These standards promote fairness, transparency, accountability, and privacy, while ac- commodating the evolving challenges of conversational AI. Intelligent evaluation methods play a crucial role in measuring the quality and effectiveness of ChatGPT. We have explored metrics beyond traditional measures, incorporating user feedback and reinforcement learning techniques. By leveraging these methods, we can comprehensively assess response coherence, context-awareness, fluency, relevance, and user engagement. Our evaluation framework incorporates task-specific benchmarks, real-world application benchmarks, and multi-turn di- alogue benchmarks to enhance adaptability and representativeness. These benchmarks capture the nuances and complexities of conversa- tional AI, providing a holistic evaluation of ChatGPT’s performance. Through this comprehensive evaluation framework, we aim to drive the responsible and impactful development of ChatGPT and conversational AI systems. By continually refining benchmarks, adapting standards, and utilizing intelligent evaluation methods, we can foster systems that deliver natural, contextually aware, and ethically sound conversational experiences. As the field of conversational AI evolves, our evaluation framework serves as a foundation for ongoing research, collaboration, and improvement. We hope that this framework inspires further ad- vancements, promotes user-centric design, and ensures that ChatGPT and future conversational AI systems meet the highest standards of performance, ethics, and user satisfaction.
