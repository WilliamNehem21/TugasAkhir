In this paper, for self-adjoint fourth order differential equations, we establish some lower bounds on the distance between zeros of a nontrivial solution and also lower bounds on the distance between zeros of a solution and/or its derivatives. We also give new results related to boundary value problems which arise in the bending of rods. The main results will be proved by making use of some generalizations of Hardy, Opial and Wirtinger type inequalities.

Introduction

The oscillation and nonoscillation properties of the solutions of selfadjoint fourth order differential equations
(p(t)x''(t))'' + q(t)x(t)= 0,	(1.1)
and
(p(t)x''(t))'' — q(t)x(t)= 0,	(1.2)
were the subject of an extensive study in the fundamental paper of Lighton and Nehari [25] where the coefficients p and q are continuous positive functions. The investigation of the oscillatory behaviour of this type of equations originated with the vibrating rod problem of mathematical physics (see Ref. [38]). If the rod is clamped at its two endpoints t = a and t = b, it

is well known that the deflection of the rod at time zero is an eigenfunction for the (1.2) with the boundary condition
x(a)= x'(a)= x(b)= x'(b)= 0.	(1.3)
Later these equations and their general forms have been studied extensively by other authors, we refer the reader to the papers [4,15,17e20,23,24,26,27,31,32,34e36] and the book
[33] and the references cited therein. By a solution of (1.1) or (1.2) on the interval J4Ih[a0, N), we mean a nontrivial real- valued function x ˛ C3(J), which has the property that
p(t)x''(t)˛C2(J) and satisfies equation (1.1) or (1.2) on J. In this
paper, we assume that (1.1) or (1.2) possesses such a nontrivial
solution on I. The nontrivial solution x of (1.1) or (1.2) is said to be oscillate or to be oscillatory, if it has arbitrarily large zeros.

An equation of the form (1.1) or (1.2) is said to be disconjugate on an interval I if no nontrivial solution has more than three zeros on I counting multiplicities. If (1.1) or (1.2) is not oscillatory (i.e., if all solutions have only finitely many zeros), then the
x(a)= x'(a)= x''(a)= x(b)= 0,
or x(b)= x'(b)= x''(b)= x(a)= 0,
and the boundary conditions

	(1.9)

equation is disconjugate on some interval [a1,N) for a1 ≥ a0 (see
Ref. [25]). In general, an nth-order differential equation
x(n)(t)+ a1(t)x(n—1)(t)+ . + an(t)x(t)= 0,	(1.4)
is said to be (k, n — k) disconjugate on an interval I if no nontrivial solution has a zero of order k followed by a zero of order n — k. This means that, for every pair of points a, b ˛ I, a < b, there does not exist a nontrivial solution of (1.4) which satisfies
x(a)= x''(a)= x(b)= x''(b)= 0,	(1.10)
which correspond to a rod hinged or supported at both ends.
We also consider the boundary conditions
x(a)= x'(a)= x''(b)= x'''(b)= 0,	(1.11)
which correspond to a rod clamped at t = a and free at t = b, and the boundary conditions

x(i)(a)= 0,	i = 0, ., k — 1,
x(j)(b)= 0,	j = 0, ., n — k — 1.

(1.5)
x(b)= x'(b)= x''(a)= x'''(a)= 0,	(1.12)
which correspond to a rod clamped at t = b and free at

The least value of b such that there exists a nontrivial so- lution which satisfies (1.5), is called the (k,n — k)-conjugate point of a.
For equation (1.1), disconjugacy is equivalent to (3,1)-dis- conjugacy (which, since equation (1.1) is selfadjoint, is also equivalent to (1,3)-disconjugacy), and for equation (1.2), dis- conjugacy is equivalent to (2,2)-disconjugacy (see Ref. [25]).
The equation (1.2) is said to be (2,2)-disconjugate on [a,b] if there is no nontrivial solution x(t) and c, d ˛ [a,b], c < d such
that x(c)= x'(c)= x(d)= x'(d)= 0.
Ourmotivation inthispaper comes from the oldpaper by C. de la Valle´e Poussin [30] and the papers [10,12,14,28]. In Ref. [30] the author considered the linear nth-order differential equation (1.4)
t = a.
The paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we present some inequalities of Hardy, Opial and Wirtinger types. In Section 3, we prove several results for the equations (1.1) and (1.2) subject to the above boundary conditions. In particular, the results for the equation (1.1) will be proved in Section 3.1 subject to the boundary conditions (1.8)e(1.10). The results
for the equation (1.2) will be proved in Section 3.2 subject to the boundary conditions (1.3), (1.8) and (1.11) when p(t) < 0. The case when (1.12) holds similar to the case when (1.11) holds and will be left to the interested reader. In Section 4,
we give some illustrative examples.

x(4)(t)+ q(t)x(t)= 0,	(1.7)
the books [2,21,22]. The Hardy inequality [21,22] of the differ- ential form that we will need in this paper is given in the following theorem.

Theorem 2.1. [21,22]. If y is absolutely continuous on (a,b) with y(a) = 0 or y(b) = 0, then the following inequality holds

Theorem 2.3. [3]. Let p(t), q(t) be non-negative measurable functions on (a,b) and 0 ≤ k ≤ n — 1 (n ≥ 1) fixed. If x ˛ Cn—1[a,b]
is such that x(i)(a) = 0, k ≤ i ≤ n — 1, x(n—1) is absolutely continuous on (a,b), then
for any y ˛ C1(I) with y(a) = 0 = y(b).
If we put y(t)= x''(t) with x''(a)= 0 = x''(b) and Q(t)= l'(t),
then we have the following inequality which gives a relation between x'''(t) and x''(t) on the interval [a,b]. For I = [a,b], then we

Also, the inequality (2.14) holds if p(t) = Q(t). In this case the function p(t) satisfies the differential equation
(p(t)(l'(t)))' = 2p(t)l(t),	(2.16)
for any function l(t) satisfies l(t)s0.
