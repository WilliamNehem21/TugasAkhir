Abstract: Candidatus Accumulibacter, a prominent polyphosphate-accumulating

organism (PAO) in wastewater treatment, plays a crucial role in enhanced biological

phosphorus removal (EBPR). The genetic underpinnings of its polyphosphate

accumulation capabilities, however, remain largely unknown. Here, we conducted a

comprehensive genomic analysis of Ca. Accumulibacter-PAOs and their relatives

within the Rhodocyclaceae family, identifying 124 core genes acquired via horizontal

gene transfer (HGT) at its least common ancestor. Metatranscriptomic analysis of an

enrichment culture of Ca. Accumulibacter revealed active transcription of 44 of these

genes during an EBPR cycle, notably including the polyphosphate kinase 2 (PPK2)

gene instead of the commonly recognized polyphosphate kinase 1 (PPK1) gene.

Intriguingly, the phosphate regulon (Pho) genes showed minimal transcriptions,

pointing to a distinctive fact of Pho dysregulation, where PhoU, the phosphate signaling

complex protein, was not regulating the high-affinity phosphate transport (Pst) system,

resulting in continuous phosphate uptake. To prevent phosphate toxicity, Ca.

Accumulibacter utilized the laterally acquired PPK2 to condense phosphate into

polyphosphate, resulting in the polyphosphate-accumulating feature. This study

provides novel insights into the evolutionary emergence of the polyphosphate-

accumulating trait in Ca. Accumulibacter, offering  potential  advancements  in

understanding the PAO phenotype in the EBPR process.

1 Introduction


With the rapid development of industry and the economy, there has been a significant

surge in wastewater generation. This escalating wastewater production has, in turn,

resulted in excessive phosphorus (P) discharge, leading to adverse consequences such

as eutrophication, water quality deterioration, and aquatic ecosystem degeneration [1-

3]. Enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) is an environmentally friendly

and economical process widely applied in municipal wastewater treatment plants

(WWTPs) for P removal [4-10]. This process is mediated by a group of microorganisms,

namely	polyphosphate-accumulating	organisms	(PAOs)	[11-14].	Candidatus

Accumulibacter is a model genus of PAOs commonly found in lab- and full-scale EBPR

systems [15-18]. Under anaerobic conditions, Ca. Accumulibacter uses intracellularly

stored polyphosphate (poly-P) as an energy source to power the uptake of volatile fatty

acids (VFAs). This metabolic process results in the release of phosphate. The

assimilated VFAs are then polymerized and stored as polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs).

In the subsequent aerobic phase, PHAs are oxidized for cell metabolism and

reproduction. Excess phosphate is removed from the aquatic phase to synthesize poly-

P, achieving P removal [19-22]. This unique metabolic feature allows PAOs to thrive in

alternating anaerobic-aerobic conditions, conferring sustainable P removal. However,

the key genetic basis affording PAOs the ability to P cycling is unclear. Genes known

to be indispensable for the P cycling feature, e.g., the polyphosphate kinase gene (ppk)

and exopolyphosphatase gene (ppx) for poly-P synthesis and hydrolysis, respectively,

and the inorganic phosphate transporter gene (pit) and the high-affinity phosphate

transporter gene (pst) for phosphate transport, are widely preserved in the bacterial

domain, including in non-PAOs [23, 24]. Their presence does not guarantee the P

cycling ability, and the key genes have yet to be identified. The transition from non-

PAOs to PAOs may be driven by adaptive evolution [25, 26].

The need to understand the gain and loss of genes in different strains and the genome

diversification in a given lineage of organisms gave rise to pangenomics. A pangenome

encompasses the entire set of genes from all individuals of a specific lineage [27, 28].

Genes in a pangenome are divided into core genes and variable genes [29]. The

collection of genes commonly present in all individuals of a specific lineage is called

the core pangenome, representing the common genetic features of a microbial lineage

[30]. The variable genes can be further divided into unique genes (found in a single

strain/genome) and dispensable genes (shared in at least two but not all strains/genomes)

[31]. Dispensable genes represent the intra-lineage diversity encoded among different

members [29]. By avoiding single sample bias and ensuring full representation of

genomic diversity of different lineage members, the analysis of the pangenome provides

insight into the genetic basis of common phenotypic characteristics shared in a group

of bacteria, greatly improving our ability to solve complex phenotypic problems [32-

34]. Comparative genomics has been applied to study the evolution and development

of many bacterial species [35-40]. Via comparative genomic analysis, Fernandez-Fueyo

et al. [41] found a subset of potentially important genes for selective lignin

decomposition in Ceriporipsis subvermispora.

Oyserman et al. [42] previously constructed a pangenome of the Rhodocyclaceae family

(including ten Ca. Accumulibacter and 16 out-group genomes) to explore the genetic

composition	and	evolutionary	changes	in	metabolic	pathways	of	the	Ca.

Accumulibacter genus. However, at the time, limited numbers of Ca. Accumulibacter

genomes were available, with more than half having low completeness (<90%). The

deficiency in genome quality and quantity may result in an inadequate representation

of the lineage pangenome and affect the downstream analysis of genes. With the

advance in EBPR research and sequencing techniques, increasing numbers of high-

quality Ca. Accumulibacter genomes have been obtained [7, 14, 18, 43-49]. New PAOs

and glycogen-accumulating organisms (GAOs) were also identified in genera

phylogenetically closely related to Ca. Accumulibacter. GAOs occupy a similar

ecological niche as PAOs in EBPR systems. They use glycogen instead of

polyphosphate as an energy source for anaerobic carbon source uptake, thus competing

with PAOs. For instance, a Propionivibrio member was shown to perform as a GAO in

full-scale WWTPs in Denmark [50]. Two Dechloromonas members in the same

WWTPs	(i.e.,	Ca.	Dechloromonas	phosphoritropha	and	Ca.	Dechloromonas

phosphorivorans) were revealed to be PAOs [51]. The identification of Dechloromonas-

related PAOs raises the possibility that the emergence of the PAO phenotype may have

occurred before the Ca. Accumulibacter's last common ancestor (LCA). The evolution

in the P cycling feature needs to be re-evaluated and traced. Combined with the analysis

of gene transcriptional characteristics of representative PAO strains, the key genomic

characteristics distinguishing PAOs and non-PAOs may be further identified and

determined, which would significantly advance the understanding of the genomic basis

of the PAO phenotype.

To understand the emergence of the PAO phenotype of Ca. Accumulibacter, we selected

43 high-quality genomes within the Rhodocyclaceae family for comparative genomic

analysis. A pangenome of the Rhodocyclaceae family, including 21 Ca. Accumulibacter

genomes, seven of which were recovered from our EBPR reactors, 22 out-group

genomes, including two confirmed Dechloromonas PAOs, i.e., Ca. Dechloromonas

phosphoritropha and Ca. Dechloromonas phosphorivorans [51], and one Propionivibrio

GAO genome, Ca. Propionivibrio aalborgensis [50], was constructed. In the analysis of

genes within the pangenome, genes were classified as ancestral, derived, flexible, or

lineage-specific genes. The dynamics in these genes in the evolutionary process were

analyzed, and metatranscriptomic analyses were performed on an enrichment culture of

Ca. Accumulibacter Clade IIC SCUT-2 for identifying their active genes in a typical

anaerobic-aerobic cycle to narrow down the range of genes important for the PAO

phenotype of Ca. Accumulibacter. Genomic comparisons were further performed

between	Ca.	Accumulibacter,	two	Dechloromonas-related	PAOs,	and	the

Propionivibrio GAO. Among the numerous genes investigated, two key players

emerged: the phosphate signaling complex protein gene (phoU) in the Pho regulon and

the laterally derived polyphosphate kinase 2 gene (ppk2). These genes were identified

as instrumental in the emergence of the PAO phenotype of Ca. Accumulibacter. This

study provides new insights into the development of the P cycling trait of Ca.

Accumulibacter.

2 Materials and Methods


2.1 Data acquisition and evaluation


The genomes used for analysis included seven high-quality genomes recovered from

our EBPR reactors and 36 genomes obtained  from the National Center for

Biotechnology  Information  (NCBI)  database. All  43  genomes  belong  to  the

Rhodocyclaceae family, including 21 Ca. Accumulibacter genomes and 22 out-group

genomes (ten Dechloromonas, seven Thauera, three Azoarcus, one Propionivibrio, and

one Zooglea ramigera genomes). The completeness and contamination of the genomes

were evaluated using CheckM [52]. The GenBank assembly accession, corresponding

species names, and additional details about the qualities of these genomes can be found

in the Supplementary Materials Table S1–S3.


2.2 Orthologue analyses


Orthologous gene clustering is necessary for the reconstruction of the ancestral state.

To find orthologous gene clusters based on the protein sequences, all vs. all BLAST of

each Rhodocyclaceae genome was conducted using Orthofinder 2.5.4 [53] with

parameters -evalue 1e-5, -seg yes, -soft_masking true, -use_sw_tback. The results were

filtered to the query coverage ≥ 75% and the percent identity ≥ 70%. Orthologous gene

clusters were identified using MCL version 14–137 with an inflation value of 1.1 [54].


2.3 Phylogenetic analysis of pangenome


Orthofinder was used to identify the pan single-copy genes for reliable phylogenic tree

construction and gene flux analysis. The pan single-copy genes were aligned using the

linsi option in MAFFT version 7.508 [55] and masked in Gblocks version 0.91b [56].

Seqkit (version 2.3.0) [57] was used to sort the single-copy gene sequences and convert

the multi-line sequences into a one-line sequence. Iqtree version 2.2.0.3 [58] was used

to predict the best phylogenetic tree model. Finally, the tree was constructed with model

Q. insect+F+I+I+R4. Landscaping of the phylogenetic tree was achieved using iTOL

version 6.6 [59].


2.4 Pangenome analysis


When a genome set has incomplete genomes, it is necessary to determine a threshold

number of genomes in which a gene must be observed in order to call it ‘core’. The

probability that a gene was observed in all Ca. Accumulibacter genomes are the product

of the completeness of each genome. The probability of a gene's absence in one genome

while being present in all other genomes was computed by multiplying the

completeness of the remaining genomes with the incompleteness (i.e., 1 minus the

completeness) of the incomplete genomes. Cut-off values were calculated using the R

script [60] (Supplementary Materials Spreadsheet 1). The maximum number of

genomes allowing an effective calculation of the cutoff value was 21. Via a

comprehensive evaluation of the quality and the clade distribution of all available

genomes, 21 high-quality Ca. Accumulibacter genomes covering eight different clades

were used for pangenomic analysis (The completeness and contamination of these

genomes are documented in the Supplemental Materials Table S1–S2).

2.5 Gene gain/loss analysis


Gene flux was analyzed using Count [61] based on the matrix of orthologous gene

family abundance obtained in the previous analyses. For a more comprehensive

examination of gene gain and loss dynamics, we applied a Wagner parsimony penalty

of 2 [62, 63]. Genes acquired before the node of the LCA of Ca. Accumulibacter were

defined as ancestral, while those acquired at the node of Ca. Accumulibacter LCA were

defined as derived genes. Genes determined to be obtained via horizontal gene transfer

(HGT) in the derived genes were classified as laterally derived genes. Lineage-specific

genes were present in a single Ca. Accumulibacter genome. Flexible genes were present

in more than one but less than 18 Ca. Accumulibacter genomes. Genetic comparisons

were performed between PAO and GAO genomes to understand the differences in their

genetic makeup better. The pangenome is composed of 21 Ca. Accumulibacter and two

Dechloromonas PAOs were denoted as the pan PAO genome. Core genes of the pan

PAO genome were defined as genes belonging to the core genes of the pan Ca.

Accumulibacter genome and were also present in two Dechloromonas PAO genomes.

Differential genes were defined as core genes present in the pan PAO genome but absent

in the Ca. Propionivibrio aalborgensis GAO genome.


2.6 Metabolic function analysis


The ancestral, derived, flexible, and lineage-specific genes were annotated and

classified based on KEGG annotations [64] of clade IIC member SCUT-2 [49] and clade

IIA member UW1 [4, 26]. The number of genes annotated in each metabolic pathway

was counted, with the number of each type of gene being divided by the total number

of genes in the pathway. Metabolic pathways with high proportions of derived genes

were considered to have undergone major changes during evolution.


2.7 Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) identification


Parametric and phylogenetic methods are commonly used to infer HGT [65]. This study

used the phylogenetic method for HGT identification. Each derived gene was queried

in the non-redundant (NR) database (published on May 7, 2015) [66] using the

following BLASTP parameter [-max_target_seqs 100-value 1E-6] to preserve the first

100 BLAST results. The representative species were obtained from the first 100 BLAST

results. Subsequently, the numbers and percentages of Ca. Accumulibacter, non-Ca.

Accumulibacter Rhodocyclaceae, and non-Rhodocyclaceae members in the first 100

BLAST results were then calculated. A gene was considered a laterally derived gene if

the numbers of Ca. Accumulibacter or non-Ca. Accumulibacter Rhodocyclaceae-

related hits were less than 10%. All core and differential-derived genes in each

metabolic pathway were analyzed to determine if they were obtained via HGT. The

derived genes that were classified as HGT-originated are referred to as laterally derived

genes. The origination of key genes (ppk2 and the homolog of phoU) was further

confirmed using the phylogenetic method based on best-match analysis.


2.8 Metatranscriptomic analysis


An anaerobic-aerobic full-cycle study was performed on an enrichment culture of Ca.

Accumulibacter	Clade	IIC	SCUT-2	in	the	lab-scale	EBPR	reactor	SCUT

(Supplementary Materials). The P cycling activities and the transformation of carbon

compounds were monitored. Activated sludge samples were collected just before the

start of a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) cycle (0 min), and at 5 min (anaerobic phase),

30 min (anaerobic phase), 105 min (aerobic phase), and 120 min (aerobic phase) of the

SBR cycle. The samples were snap-frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C before the

extraction of ribonucleic acid (RNA) for metatranscriptomic analysis.

For metatranscriptomic analysis, total RNA was extracted using the RNA PowerSoil®

Total RNA Isolation Kit (Omega Bio-Tek, GA, USA). Fastp [67] and SortMeRNA [68]

removed adaptation sequences and ribosomal ribonucleic acids (rRNAs). Filtered reads

were mapped to the corresponding Ca. Accumulibacter draft genome (i.e., SCUT-2)

using BBMap version 38.96 [69] and were normalized to transcript per million (TPM).

Genes with TPM > 100 were considered to be highly transcribed. Details on the reactor

operation,	full-cycle	study,	sample	collection,	metagenomic	analysis,	and

metatranscriptomic analysis are found in the Supplementary Materials. Raw reads and

draft genomes obtained were submitted to NCBI under BioProject No. PRJNA807832

and No. PRJNA771771.


3 Results


3.1 Identification of orthologous gene clusters


A total of 60722 pan Rhodocyclaceae orthologous gene clusters were identified,

including	25080	homologous	genes	in	the	Ca.	Accumulibacter	pangenome

(Supplementary Materials Spreadsheet 2, Sheets 1 and 3). Large proportions (63.8%

and 54.7%) of gene families in the pan Rhodocyclaceae and pan Ca. Accumulibacter

genomes were present in only single genomes (Fig. 2a,b). Approximately 1% (626) of

gene families were present in ≥ 37 of the 43 genomes, which were used to define the

core pan Rhodocyclaceae genome (Fig. 2c). In the pan Ca. Accumulibacter genome,

6.9% of genes were shared in ≥ 18 genomes (Fig. 2d). Non-paralogous genes (average

gene copy per genome = 1) account for high proportions of pan Rhodocyclaceae and

pan Ca. Accumulibacter genomes (95.6% and 93.8%, respectively) (Fig. 2e,f). The

orthologous gene cluster identification results include the number of representative

genes in each genome and summary statistics of pan Rhodocyclaceae and pan Ca.

Accumulibacter gene clusters are provided in Supplementary Materials Spreadsheet 2

(Sheets 2 and 4).


3.2 Gene flux analysis


Among the 25080 gene clusters in the pan Ca. Accumulibacter genome, 2499 (9.96%)

were inferred to occur in the genome of the LCA, and 1668 (6.73%) occurred before

the LCA. Eight hundred eighteen (3.26%) were acquired at the node of LCA. Gene

occurrence possibility calculation suggested that with a genome-number cutoff of 18,

99.94% of core genes could be identified (Fig. 3a). At this cutoff value, 1725 (6.88%)

core genes were identified in the pan Ca. Accumulibacter genome (Fig. 3b,c). By

further reducing the cutoff value to 17, the number of core genes increased from 1725

to 1829, and those with known functions increased from 298 to 318. As this study

mainly focused on the changes in the genetic content, i.e., new core-derived genes and

horizontally transferred genes, looser cutoff values did not seem to bring new gains.

Thus, a relatively stricter cut-off value (i.e., 18) was used to ensure the accuracy of the

results. The gene gain or loss of a pangenome needs to be characterized in specific

lineage  member  genomes.  To  facilitate  a  subsequent  combination  with  the

transcriptome data, SCUT-2 and UW1 were used as representative genomes for gene

flux analysis. Each gene in Clade IIC SCUT-2 and Clade IIA UW1 genomes was

classified as ancestral, derived, lineage-specific, or flexible genes. There were no

significant differences in the numbers and proportions of ancestral and flexible genes

in these two genomes (ancestral genes accounted for 32.6% and 34.7%; flexible genes

accounted for 43.8% and 43.6% in SCUT-2 and UW-1, respectively). Six hundred thirty

eight and eight hundred and two derived genes were found in the SCUT-2 and UW1

genomes (17.6% and 14.0%, respectively). One hundred eighty nine lineage-specific

genes (genes occurred only in UW1) were observed in UW1, which was slightly less

than those (i.e., 275) in the SCUT-2 genome (Fig. 3d). Figure 4 and Supplementary

Materials Spreadsheet 3 provided additional details about the presence, gain and loss

of genes, and the discrete categories to which they were assigned.


3.3 Evolution of Ca. Accumulibacter metabolic pathways


The collections of genes identified as ancestral, derived, flexible, and lineage-specific

genes were annotated using KEGG [64] and were grouped into different metabolic

pathways. In SCUT-2, 2293 genes were annotated to various metabolic pathways. The

translation metabolic pathway had the highest proportion of ancestral genes (77,

accounting for 96%). The largest number of ancestral genes (224) and derived genes

(63) was observed in the carbohydrate metabolism pathway, accounting for 63% and

18%, respectively. The highest proportion (15 out of 53, 28.0%) of derived genes was

observed in the cell growth and death metabolic pathway (Fig. 5a). Within each primary

pathway, ancestral and derived genes also showed distinct proportions in different

secondary pathways. For instance, within the carbohydrate metabolism, the galactose

metabolism pathways had the highest proportion (4 out of 5, 80%) of derived genes.

Whereas ancestral genes dominated the citric acid cycle (TCA cycle) (25 out of 30,

83%) and the glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism pathways (33 out of 45, 73%).

In signal transduction, the two-component system contained the highest proportion of

derived genes (27 out of 182, 15%). In membrane transport, among the 122 ABC-

transporter encoding genes, 18 were derived (15%) (Fig. 5). Similar number and

proportion of genes assigning to various metabolic pathways were observed in the Ca.

Accumulibacter clade IIA UW1 genome with only two metabolic pathways (transport

and catabolism, cell growth and death) showing significant differences in the

proportions of derived genes (28% and 40% in SCUT-2 and 14% and 23% in UW1,

respectively) (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Materials Fig. S1). These results indicated that

different strains of Ca. Accumulibacter underwent comparable developmental changes

during evolution but, at the same time, preserved a certain degree of gene diversity.

Detailed annotation of each gene in SCUT-2 and UW1 can be viewed in Supplementary

Spreadsheet 4.

3.4 Pan Ca. Accumulibacter phylogenetic analysis of derived genes


Relatively strict parameters (i.e., 70% identity and 75% coverage) were used to identify

homologous gene clusters. The derived genes were manually classified into those

derived from accumulative mutations and HGT. Phylogenetic analysis was further

performed to confirm that ppk2 and the homolog of phoU are horizontally derived

(Supplementary Materials Fig. S4). Among 298 core-derived genes successfully

annotated in KEGG, 124 were shown to have been acquired via HGT. Among the 124

genes, 67 were involved in KEGG pathways. The carbohydrate metabolism pathway

harbors the highest numbers (25) of derived genes via HGT, including these in

glycolysis/gluconeogenesis  (e.g.,  genes  encoding  the  phosphoglucomutase,  the

glucokinase, and the phosphoglycerate kinase), starch and sucrose metabolism (e.g., the

starch synthase, and the glycogen phosphorylase genes), and in butanoate metabolism

(genes encoding the poly[(R)-3-hydroxyalkanoate polymerase subunits). In signal

transduction, the two-component system contained ten laterally derived genes, such as

genes encoding the REDOX signal transduction system proteins RegA/B and the

phosphate regulon proteins PhoR-PhoB. Another remarkable set of genes derived via

HGT was oxidative phosphorylation in the energy metabolism pathway, including these

encoding the NADH-quinone oxidoreductase subunit, the polyphosphate kinase, and

the cytochrome C. The inorganic phosphate transporter gene (pit) was also acquired via

HGT. Similar results were observed for UW1. In the two-component system, genes

encoding the REDOX signal transduction system proteins RegA/B and the phosphate

regulon proteins PhoR-PhoB were laterally derived. More details about the BLAST

comparison results can be found in Supplementary Materials Spreadsheet 5.


3.5 Comparison of genetic compositions in PAOs and non-PAOs


In the context of our investigation, the presence or absence of specific genes in Ca.

Accumulibacter, compared to closely related PAOs and non-PAOs, holds significant

implications for elucidating the genetic basis of the P cycling phenotype. If a gene was

present in Ca. Accumulibacter, but absent in other closely related PAOs, may also not

be a key to developing the P cycling phenotype. Conversely, if a gene was present in

Ca. Accumulibacter, or their closely related PAOs but absent in non-PAOs, might be a

key gene to the emergence of the PAO phenotype. For a better understanding of the

genomic difference between closely related PAOs and non-PAOs, a pan PAO genome

(composed of 21 Ca. Accumulibacter and two Dechloromonas PAOs) [51] analysis was

performed. The pan PAO genome was compared to the Ca. Propionivibrio aalborgensis

(a closely related GAO) [50] genome to identify differential genes (defined as core

genes present in the pan PAO genome but absent in the Ca. Propionivibrio aalborgensis

genome). In the pan PAO genome, 124 differential genes were identified. Alkaline

phosphatase synthesis response regulator (PhoP) and polyphosphate kinase 2 (PPK2)

genes were both differential genes. Other genes in the operon or the genes regulated by

PhoP were not differential genes. Carbohydrate metabolism had the largest differential

genes (16), including those encoding the acetyl-CoA C-acetyltransferase and the enoyl-

CoA hydratase. The cofactor and vitamin metabolic pathway harbored the second

largest number of differential genes (11), followed by energy metabolism (9),

replication and repair (6), and signal transduction (5) metabolic pathways. The lowest

number (1) of differential genes was observed in the transcription and metabolism of

other amino acid pathways. Further analysis of another 21 available Propionivibrio

genomes  confirmed  that  ppk2  and  phoU are  differential  genes  between  Ca.

Accumulibacter and Propionivibrio. HGT analysis was aimed at gene acquisition in Ca.

Accumulibacter during evolution, based on the hypothesis that the emergence of the P

cycling ability by PAOs resulted from the acquisition of certain key genes. However,

the hypothesis ignored the possibility that non-PAOs may have lost certain key genes

in the process of evolution, leading to their inability to remove P. Differential genes

included gene loss in non-PAOs during evolution. The analysis in this part allows us to

understand the evolutionary process from a different perspective more comprehensively.

More details about the differential genes (metabolic pathway and functional annotation)

can be found in Supplementary Materials Spreadsheet 6.


3.6 Metatranscriptomic profiles


By analysis of the gene transcription levels of Ca. Accumulibacter in a typical EBPR

cycle, we excluded genes that displayed no remarkable transcription in the comparative

genome may be excluded. Thus, the range of genes could be further narrowed down,

facilitating the identification of key genes important to the PAO phenotype.

Metatranscriptomic analysis was performed on an enrichment culture of  Ca.

Accumulibacter clade IIC strain SCUT-2 (with a relative abundance of 37.1%, as

suggested by the metagenomic analysis). In the SCUT-2 genome, out of 5037 annotated

genes, 906 were highly transcribed (TPM > 100). There were 298 core-derived genes,

84 of which were highly transcribed (Supplementary Materials Spreadsheet 7). To

understand the dynamic patterns and functional relationships of 905 core genes with

known function, they were classified into five clusters using the Mfuzz [70] (Fig. 6b).

Most genes (e.g., the acetate permease gene actP, NOF05_02545) in Cluster 1 were

related to the transporter for carbon uptake and energy utilization. Cluster 2 showed a

pattern of increased transcription throughout the anaerobic period, peaking after oxygen

exposure. Key members of this cluster included the phosphate transport system

substrate-binding protein (pstS, NOF05_04305) and the laterally derived polyphosphate

kinase 2 gene (ppk2, NOF05_17285). Cluster 3 genes showed high transcription at the

beginning of the anaerobic stage and reduced towards the end of the anaerobic cycle,

correlating with the depletion of acetate (Fig. 6a). Their high transcription in the aerobic

stage was mostly related to the routing of anaerobically stored carbon to the TCA cycle

and glycogenesis [7, 26]. Cluster 4 contained genes encoding the distant homolog of

PhoU (NOF05_17860, NOF05_12350) and antitoxin CptB (NOF05_13125), which

showed low transcription during the anaerobic stage but were upregulated during the

aerobic phase. These genes possibly play a role in sustaining vital activities and

controlling homeostatic environments [71]. Finally, genes in Cluster 5 may be

associated with the maintenance of stable intracellular environments or cell growth,

including genes encoding the ion transporters, such as the magnesium transporter gene

(NOF05_18175)	and	the	low-affinity	inorganic	phosphate	transporter	(pit,

NOF05_12345). These clustering patterns aligned with the metabolic characteristics of

Ca. Accumulibacter in EBPR (Fig. 6a).

The transcription of horizontally transferred genes in SCUT-2 was further analyzed. 44

genes, which were identified to be obtained via HGT, were highly transcribed (Fig. 6c).

These  genes  were  involved  in  pathways,  such  as  glycolysis/gluconeogenesis

(phosphoglycerate kinase, and phosphoglucomutase), ABC transporters (branched-

chain amino acid transport system substrate-binding protein), butanoate metabolism

(poly[(R)-3-hydroxyalkanoate] polymerase subunit), the two-component system (low

molecular weight protein-tyrosine phosphatase, polysaccharide biosynthesis/export

protein, tyrosine-protein kinase, and serine protease), transporters for inorganic salts

(sulfate permease, and magnesium transporter), and showed high transcription

throughout the EBPR cycle. Polyphosphate kinase 2 gene (ppk2) was also highly

transcribed and was significantly upregulated in the anaerobic phase. The transcription

of the phosphate transport regulator (a distant homolog of PhoU) was significantly

upregulated in the aerobic stage. PHA synthesis-related genes were also highly

transcribed. A full list of the SCUT-2 gene transcription data can be found in

Supplementary Materials Spreadsheet 7.

Comparisons were further made to the gene transcription characteristics of UW1 [26].

35 horizontally derived gene families were highly transcribed in both SCUT-2 and UW1

(Supplementary Materials Fig. S2). Apart from the homolog phoU genes and pit, which

are related to phosphate regulation and transport, 42 laterally derived gene families

were under-transcribed in SCUT-2 but highly transcribed in UW1, including the acetate

kinase gene. These 42 gene families may not play a key role in the evolution of non-

PAO to PAO due to their different transcription behaviors in SCUT-2 and UW1.

Combined with transcriptomic analysis, the range of key genes can be effectively

reduced, and a metabolic model of Ca. Accumulibacter can be constructed (Fig. 6d).

Most genes in the central carbon metabolic pathway were highly transcribed non-HGT

genes, indicating that this pathway is indispensable for Ca. Accumulibacter, yet raises

doubts about its direct involvement in the evolution from a non-PAO metabolism to a

PAO. In the P cycling pathway, several laterally acquired genes were involved,

suggesting their potential pivotal role in the evolution of Ca. Accumulibacter. Some of

them were highly transcribed, further implying their importance in the evolution of Ca.

Accumulibacter (Fig. 6).


4 Discussion


Previous research suggested that the transition of PAO from non-PAO may have

occurred at the node of Ca. Accumulibacter LCA [42]. However, a recent investigation

has  put  forth  compelling  evidence  indicating  the  presence  of  PAOs  in  the

Dechloromonas genus (i.e., Ca. Dechloromonas phosphoritropha, Ca. Dechloromonas

phosphorivorans) [51], raising a possibility that the emergence of the PAO phenotype

may have occurred before the Ca. Accumulibacter LCA. Here, we discuss the function

of key laterally derived genes in the context of pangenomics and known PAO

metabolism. A  metatranscriptomic  analysis  of  an  enrichment  culture  of  Ca.

Accumulibacter Clade IIC member SCUT-2 contrasting those of Ca. Accumulibacter

Clade IIA UW1 was performed to study the transcriptional dynamics of key genes in

Ca. Accumulibacter. This approach allowed the exclusion of genes that were not highly

transcribed in the large collection of laterally derived genes to narrow down the range

of key genes to obtain new insights on key genomic features of the polyphosphate

accumulating trait.


4.1 Carbon substrate uptake


The largest number of genes were annotated to the carbohydrate metabolism pathway

in both SCUT-2 and UW1 genomes (354 and 369, respectively). The SCUT-2 genome

contained 224 ancestral genes, 63 derived genes, and 49 laterally derived genes.

Transcriptomic analysis suggested that when acetate was used as a carbon source, genes

directly related to intracellular acetate processing and PHA synthesis were remarkably

upregulated in SCUT-2 (Supplementary Materials Spreadsheet 7). The high-affinity

acetyl-CoA synthetase (NOF05_02565) and low-affinity phosphate acetyltransferase

(NOF05_11790) are responsible for acetate activation [11, 72]. Other genes involved

in the acetyl-CoA pathway, including the pyruvate kinase gene (NOF05_14290) and the

phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene (NOF05_14615), maintained high levels of

transcription throughout the anaerobic-aerobic cycle. However, these genes are all

ancestral genes. Only one horizontally transferred gene (i.e., the acetate kinase gene,

NOF05_16845) was barely transcribed. Therefore, genes related to acetate processing

may not be pivotal factors contributing to the emergence of the PAO phenotype. In

addition, in the TCA cycle [73], there were 30 genes. Among them, only the

dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase gene (NOF05_18520) was laterally derived, whereas

transcribed at a low level. This indicates that the gain/loss of genes in the TCA cycle

might not have contributed remarkably to the evolution of non-PAOs to PAOs. Four

laterally derived genes occurred in the PHA synthesis pathway (phaC NOF05_18015,

NOF05_21650,  NOF05_21620,  and  phaA NOF05_18020),  NOF05_21650  and

NOF05_21620 were highly transcribed throughout the EBPR cycle (Fig. 6). Whereas

Ca. Propionivibrio aalborgensis also encoded these genes [50]. Their contribution to

the evolution from a non-PAO metabolism to a PAO metabolism was unlikely.


4.2 Two-component systems


The two-component signal transduction system enables bacteria to sense, respond, and

adapt to diverse and dynamic environmental conditions [74]. This system is commonly

preserved in the bacterial domain. The number of genes in the two-component system

was considered to be closely related to the bacteria’s living environment [75]. Bacteria

living in extreme environments tend to encode many signaling proteins for improved

adaption [76]. In the SCUT-2 genome, a total of 182 genes were annotated to the two-

component system, including 81 ancestral genes and 27 derived genes. Notably, 12 of

these genes have been acquired laterally. In both SCUT-2 and UW1, phosphate regulon

response regulator gene phoB (NOF05_18105), phosphate regulon sensor histidine

kinase gene phoR (NOF05_18105), and redox signaling genes regA and regB

(NOF05_11115, NOF05_11120) were laterally derived. RegB/RegA was shown to

control and regulate a variety of basic metabolic processes in Rhodobacter, Capsulatus,

and Sphaeroides, such as photosynthesis, CO2 fixation, N2 assimilation, denitrification,

and electron transport [77] via direct or indirect control of respective operons [78, 79].

However, both regA and regB were absent in two Dechloromonas PAO genomes

(GCA_016722705.1 and GCA_016721185.1) [51], suggesting that the redox signaling

RegA/B were not indispensable for a PAO phenotype. PhoR-PhoB is present in both

Ca. Accumulibacter and two Dechloromonas PAO genomes can potentially play a role

in PAO phenotype evolution. Since the PhoR-PhoB system is a part of the Pho regulon,

further discussion was provided in the following subsection.


4.3 Phosphate regulatory system


The phosphate regulator (Pho) is a regulatory mechanism to maintain and manage

inorganic phosphate concentrations in bacterial cells. The system typically consists of

extracellular enzymes, transporters, and enzymes involved in the intracellular storage

of phosphate [80]. Signal transduction of Pho regulators requires seven proteins,

including PhoR, PhoB, four components of the ABC transporter Pst (PstS, PstA, PstB,

and PstC), and PhoU. An increase in the extracellular phosphate concentration near the

PstSCAB transporter would increase phosphate binding to PhoU, inhibiting the PhoR

kinase activity and the PstSCAB transporter activity. In the absence of phosphate input,

PhoU dissociates with phosphate, allowing the phosphate transport (Pst) to return to a

normal working state [81]. The above feedback control enables bacteria to maintain and

control a relatively stable intracellular phosphate concentration. Most of the genes in

the Pho regulatory system in Ca. Accumulibacter are laterally derived, including those

encoding PhoR and PhoB. In addition, within the genomes of Ca. Accumulibacter, three

distant homologs of the phoU gene (designated as NOF05_17860, NOF05_09930, and

NOF05_09935) were identified. Distant homologs are protein pairs with similar

structures and functions but low gene sequence similarity [82]. The homolog phoU is

located in the pit operon within Ca. Accumulibacter genomes. Moreover, PhoR-PhoB

is  also  present  in  two  Dechloromonas  PAO  genomes  (Ca.  Dechloromonas

phosphoritropha and Ca. Dechloromonas phosphorivorans).

In SCUT-2, the transcription of phoR (NOF05_18110) and phoB (NOF05_18105,

NOF05_19100) was negligible. The transcription level of phoR (CAP2UW1_1997) in

UW1 was also low. The transcription of phoB (CAP2UW1_1996) in the aerobic phase

was slightly upregulated (with TPM values from 12 to 92) but was still at relatively low

levels (Supplementary Materials Spreadsheet 5). These results suggest that PhoR-PhoB

in Ca. Accumulibacter was probably not active in perceiving phosphate concentrations.

Similarly, the phoU genes were almost not transcribed (with the maximum TPM values

< 12, Fig. 6). Although the homolog phoU genes showed high transcription, the trend

was not in line with pst, indicating that the PhoU or their laterally derived homologs

were not effectively regulating Pst (Supplementary Materials Fig. S3). The same

phenomenon  was  observed  in  UW1  [26]  and  UW6  [45]  metatranscriptome

(Supplementary Materials Spreadsheet 7 ). In Staphylococcus aureus, the absence of

phoU homolog, located in the pit operon, leads to the upregulation of phosphate

transporter  genes  (pst),  increasing  intracellular  polyphosphate  levels  [71].  In

Sinorhizobium meliloti, the absence of phoU resulted in excessive accumulation of

phosphate, which inactivates cells due to P poisoning, resulting in poor cell growth [83,

84]. Based on these results, we proposed two hypotheses. (1) PhoU in Ca.

Accumulibacter was ineffective in regulating Pst even under high intracellular

phosphate  concentrations  (no  transcription  of  the  phoU,  and  the  unmatched

transcription of phoU homolog and pst, Supplementary Materials Fig. S3). Pst

continued to operate (as indicated by the high transcription of pst in the transcriptome,

Supplementary Materials Fig. S3), resulting in excessive phosphate accumulation in

cells (Fig. 6a). The laterally derived PPK2 functioned (as suggested by the high

transcription of ppk2, Supplementary Materials Fig. S3) to condense excess phosphate

into poly-P to avoid P poisoning. The second is that, in Ca. Accumulibacter, since phoU,

the homolog of phoU and ppk2 were derived from different donor bacteria

(Rhodocyclaceae, Burkholderia, and Gramaproteobacteria, respectively, as suggested

by the BLAST results, Supplementary Materials SpreadSheet 5), their encoding

proteins (i.e., PhoU, PhoU homolog, and PPK2) may have incompatible phosphate

activation/inactivation thresholds. PPK2 continued to synthesize poly-P by consuming

intracellular phosphate transported via Pst, resulting in consistently low intracellular

phosphate concentration, which was insufficient to combine with PhoU and/or its

homologs to downregulate Pst. In the SCUT-2 and UW1 transcriptomes (Fig. 6), PPK2

showed high levels of transcription during the entire EBPR cycle (with TPM values up

to 12481 in SCUT-2), which was further up-regulated in the aerobic stage, suggesting

that PPK2 worked to synthesize poly-P by consuming phosphate which was imported

via Pst, avoiding possible cell inactivation and poisoning due to elevated intracellular

phosphate concentrations  and achieved poly-P accumulation.  In addition, Ca.

Dechloromonas phosporitropha lacked pst, phoU, phoB, and phoR genes in the Pho

regulon, which is consistent with our hypothesis that the Pho regulation may not work

properly in PAOs. The transcriptomics data of Microlunatus phosphovorus (BioProject

No. PRJNA984968) and proteomics data of Tetrasphaera elongate (obtained from

Herbst et al. [85]) were further analyzed to check whether the same hypothesis could

apply to other PAOs. In the transcriptome of Microlunatus phosphovorus, we found that

the transcriptional patterns of pst were also inconsistent with those of phoU during an

anaerobic and aerobic cycle (Supplementary Materials). From the proteome of

Tetrasphaera elongate, the relative abundances of Pst and PhoU did not vary

significantly between anaerobic and oxic conditions; hence, they were not significantly

affected by changes in phosphate concentrations [85]. Taken together, these results

suggest that in Microlunatus phosphovorus and Tetrasphaera elongate, the regulation

of Pst by PhoU was not effective and that the Pho dysregulation hypothesis may also

apply to non-Ca. Accumulibacter PAOs. However, additional work is needed to confirm

its broad applicability.

Despite that, there is limited research on the Pho regulatory system in Ca.

Accumulibacter, the transcriptomics and gene origination analysis in the Pho regulon

suggested that it may represent a key link in the emergence of the PAO phenotype.

4.4 Transport of phosphate


Phosphorus (organic and/or inorganic) is a typical restricting nutrient. Therefore,

microorganisms developed adaptive mechanisms to cope with ordinary P deficiency.

Low-affinity inorganic phosphate transport systems (Pit) and high-affinity phosphate

transport systems (Pst) are key transporters used for inorganic phosphate transport [86,

87]. In the pan Ca. Accumulibacter genomes, genes encoding the Pst transporter, are

neither core nor laterally derived. Furthermore, Ca. Dechloromonas phosporitropha

(PAO) do not encode any pst [51]. These results suggested that the Pst transport system

may not be indispensable for a PAO phenotype. Ca. Dechloromonas phosporitropha

encoded a phosphonates/phosphate transport system (Phn), which was shown to be a

high-affinity phosphate transporter in Mycobacterium smegmatis [88]. This system may

serve as a backup for the Pst transport system in Ca. Dechloromonas phosporitropha.

In the pan PAO genome, the low-affinity inorganic phosphate transporter gene (pit,

NOF05_09925, NOF05_09940) was laterally derived. The efflux of phosphate in

symport with H+ via Pit produces proton motive force, which is a key driving force for

the uptake of VFAs, lactate, succinate and amino acids by Ca. Accumulibacter [7, 8,

89]. Therefore, pit is an important feature gene for the PAO phenotype. In SCUT-2

transcriptomes, the transcription of the pit was upregulated during the transition from

anaerobic to aerobic conditions (Supplementary Materials Fig. S3). The confirmed

GAO, Ca. Propionivibrio aalborgensis, which is closely related to Ca. Accumulibacter

(Fig. 1), are lack of pit. But pit is present in the genomes of other GAOs, for example,

Defluviicoccus	GAO-HK	[90],	Ca.	Competibacter	denitrificans,	and	Ca.

Contendobacter odensis [91]. In addition, we analyzed 21 Propionivibrio genomes in

the NCBI database. Pit transporter was encoded in 13 of 21 Propionivibrio genomes

(Supplementary Materials Table S4). Anyhow, pit may not be a key feature driving the

evolution of non-PAO into PAOs and may neither be used as a marker gene for the PAO

phenotype, although it is indispensable for the P cycling trait.


5. Conclusion


In this study, we conducted pangomics with metatranscriptomic analysis on an

enrichment culture of Ca. Accumulibacter clade IIC member SCUT-2. The primary

objectives of this investigation were to understand the genomic transition in the

evolution of Ca. Accumulibacter and to identify the key genes responsible for the

emergence of the P-accumulating traits. Our study has brought forth several noteworthy

findings:

(1) A total of 298 core genes were identified as novel acquisitions in the ancestral

lineage of Ca. Accumulibacter, with 124 of them being derived via HGT. Notably, 44

of these laterally derived core genes were highly transcribed in a typical EBPR cycle.

(2) A high-affinity phosphate transport system (Pst) may not be indispensable for the

PAO phenotype. Inorganic phosphate transporter (Pit) may not be a key feature driving

non-PAO evolution into PAOs. Consequently, their encoding genes may not be reliable

markers for the PAO phenotype.

(3) Low transcription of the phoR-phoB two-component system genes and the

unmatched transcription of pst and phoU implied that the Pho regulon may not function

properly in Ca. Accumulibacter.

(4) A Pho dysregulation hypothesis was proposed. The PhoU and laterally derived PhoU

homologs in Ca. Accumulibacter were ineffective in regulating Pst, resulting in

excessive P uptake. To avoid P poisoning, the laterally derived PPK2 was employed to

condense excess phosphate into poly-P. Alternatively, PhoU and PPK2 genes were

derived from different donor bacteria, resulting in unmatched activation/inactivation

thresholds. PPK2 tends to reduce the intracellular phosphate concentration to levels

perceived by PhoU as low-phosphate states, thereby promoting continuous phosphate

uptake.

This study is expected to provide a new perspective for understanding the development

and evolution of the P cycling traits for Ca. Accumulibacter.

Highlights

298 core genes were acquired by Ca. Accumulibacter at their least common ancestor

124 of these core genes were obtained via horizontal gene transfer (HGT)

phoR, phoB, phoU homologs, pit and ppk2 in Ca. Accumulibacter were laterally derived
Incompatible transcriptions of phoR, phoB, phoU, and pst were observed

Pho regulon disorder may be a key to the P accumulating trait of Ca. Accumulibacter
