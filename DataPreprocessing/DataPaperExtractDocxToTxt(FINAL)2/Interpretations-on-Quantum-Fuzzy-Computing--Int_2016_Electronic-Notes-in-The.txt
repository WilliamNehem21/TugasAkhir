Abstract
Quantum processes provide a parallel model for fuzzy connectives. Calculations of quantum states may be simultaneously performed by the superposition of membership and non-membership degrees of each element regarding the intuitionistic fuzzy sets. This work aims to interpret Atanassov’s intuitionistic fuzzy logic through quantum computing, where not only intuitionistic fuzzy sets, but also their basic operations and corresponding connectives (negation, conjuntion, disjuntion, difference, codifference, implication, and
coimplication), are interpreted based on the traditional quantum circuit model.
Keywords: Quntum fuzzy computing, quantum computing, intuitionistic fuzzy logic, fuzzy implications, fuzzy difference.


Introduction
Intuitionistic fuzzy logic (IFL)[1] and quantum computing (CQ) are relevant re- search areas consolidating the analysis and the search for new solutions for difficult problems faster than the classical logical approach or conventional computing.
Similarities between these areas in the representation and modelling of uncer- tainty have been explored [2,3,4]. The uncertainty of human being’s reasoning is modelled in fuzzy logic (FL) and its extensions as the fuzzy intuitionistic logic (IFL).

By making use of the Fuzzy Set Theories (FSTs) as mathematical models inher- iting the imprecision of natural language and uncertainty from membership and non-membership degrees, which are not necessarily complementary, intuitionistic fuzzy techniques help physicists and mathematicians to transform their imprecise ideas into new computational programs [5].
The uncertainty of the real world is concerned with fundamental concepts of quantum computing by making use of properties of quantum mechanics as the su- perposition, suggesting an improvement in the efficiency regarding complex tasks. In addition, simulations using classical computers allow the development and valida- tion of basic quantum algorithms (QAs), anticipating the knowledge related to their behaviours when executed in a quantum computer. Quantum interpretations come from measurement operations performed on the corresponding quantum states.
In spite of quantum computers being restricted to a few research centers and laboratories, the studies from quantum information and quantum computation (QC) are a reality nowadays. In this context, new methods dealing with quantum fuzzy applications have been proposed [3]. In this work, the modelling and interpretation of intuitionistic fuzzy logic via quantum computing is considered, providing the description of representable fuzzy connectives by using pairs of quantum states and quantum registers from the traditional model of quantum circuits(qCs).
Some results of this research approach mainly related to interpretation of fuzzy connectives via quantum computing, as negation, conjuntion, disjuntion and impli- cations can be found in [6,7,8,9] and more recently, by considering fuzzy exclusive or operators, in [10]. This work is the first step in order to extend this approach, towards an interpretation of intuitionistic fuzzy connectives from quantum comput- ing.
In this regard, this paper considers the interpretation of uncertainty described by the membership and non-membership degrees of IFSs defined by intuitionistic fuzzy connectives by quantum states and quantum operators.
Moreover, it contributes to increase the interest in quantum algorithm applica- tions representing IFSs operations, by exploring potentialities as quantum paral- lelism, entanglement and superposition of quantum states which can provide theo- retical foundation for modelling humanoid behaviour based on intuitionistic fuzzy logic [11,12,13].
This paper is organized as follows:
Section 2 presents the fundamental concepts and properties of connectives of FL and IFL. Moreover, IFSs can be obtained by intuitionistic fuzzy operators as presented in subsection 2.2. Section 3 brings the main concepts of QC which will be considered in the development of this work. In Section 4, a discussion about IFSs which can be obtained from quantum computing following the same methodology from previous work in order to model fuzzy operations from quantum registers. In Section 5, the approach for describing IFSs using the QC is depicted. An interpre- tation of classical intuitionistic fuzzy sets from quantum states is also considered, presenting the operations on IFSs modelled from quantum transformations, relat- ing the intuitionistic fuzzy approach to the difference and implication operators,

also including their dual constructions. Finally, conclusions and further studies are discussed in Section 6.

Preliminaries
This section reports main concepts of fuzzy logic (FL) and its corresponding exten- sion, the Atanassov intuitionistic fuzzy logic (IFL).

Fuzzy connectives
FL connectives are studied from QC operators, overcoming the limitations related to quantum transitions as modelling smoothly their logical properties.
A membership function (MF) fA(x): X → [0, 1] determines the membership degree (MD) of the element x∈ X to the fuzzy set A, such that 0 ≤ fA(x) ≤ 1. Thus, a fuzzy set A related to a set X /= ∅ is given as A = {(x, fA(x)) : x ∈ X}.
A function N : [0, 1] → [0, 1] is a fuzzy negation (FN) when the following holds:
[N1] N (0) = 1 and N (1) = 0; [N2] If x ≤ y then N (x) ≥ N (y), for all x, y ∈ [0, 1]. Fuzzy negations verifying the involutive property: [N3] N (N (x)) = x, for all x ∈
[0, 1], are called strong fuzzy negations. See, e.g., the standard negation NS(x) = 
1 − x.
Fuzzy connectives can be represented by aggregation functions. Herein, we con- sider triangular norms (t-norms) and triangular conorms (t-conorms).
A triangular (co)norm is an operation (S)T : [0, 1]2 → [0, 1] such that, for all x, y, z ∈ [0, 1], the commutative and associative properties are verified along with the fact that it is an increasing function with neutral element (0) 1 .
Among different definitions of t-norms and t-conorms [14], in this work we con- sider the Algebraic Product and Algebraic Sum, respectively given as:
TP (x, y)= x · y;	and	SP (x, y)= x + y − x · y, ∀x, y ∈ [0, 1].	(1)
A binary function I : U 2 → U is an implication operator (implicator) if the following conditions are satisfied:
I0: I(1, 1) = I(0, 1) = I(0, 0) = 1 and I(1, 0) = 0.
Additional properties are considered to define a fuzzy implication from an implica- tor:
A fuzzy implication I : U 2 → U is an implicator verifying the antitonicity in the first argument, isotonicity in the second argument, falsity dominance in the antecedent and truth dominance in the consequent are verified.
In analogous manner, one can define a fuzzy implication J : U 2→U , which also satisfies the boundary conditions:
J0: I(1, 1) = I(1, 0) = I(0, 0) = 0 and I(0, 1) = 1.

A (S, N )-(co)implication is a fuzzy (co)implication I(S,N ) : U 2 → U defined
by:
I(S,N )(x, y)= S(N (x), y),	(2)
J(T,N )(x, y)= T (N (x), y), ∀x, y ∈ U.	(3)
When N is involutive then I(S,N ) is an S-implication.	The Reichenbach (co)implication is given as:
IRB(x, y)=1 − x + xy,	(4)
IRB(x, y)= x + y − xy, ∀x, y ∈ U,	(5)
is an S-implication (T -coimplication) obtained by a fuzzy negation NS(x)=1 − x and a t-conorm SP (x, y)= x + y −x· y (t-norm TP (x, y)= xy) previously presented in Eqs. (1a) and (1b), respectively.

Intuitionistic fuzzy connectives
An intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) AI in a non-empty and finite universe X , expressed as
AI = {(x, (μAI (x), νAI (x))) : x ∈X , μAI (x) + νAI (x)) ≤ 1},
extending a fuzzy set AI = {(x, μAI (x), 1 − μAI (x)) : x ∈ X}, since the non- membership degree (NMD) νAI (x) of an element x ∈X is less, at most equal to its complement, the membership degree (MD) μAI (x). Hence, it does not necessarily equal to one.
Let U˜ ⊂ [0, 1] × [0, 1], U˜ = {x˜ = (x1, x2) ∈ U˜ : x1 + x2 ≤ 1} be the set of all pairs of MDs and NMDs and lU˜ , rU˜ : U˜ →U be two projection functions on U˜, which are given by lU˜ (x˜)= lU˜ (x1, x2)= x1 and rU˜ (x˜)= rU˜ (x1, x2)= x2, respectively.
Thus, for all x˜ = (x˜1,..., x˜n) ∈ U˜n, such that x˜i = (xi1, xi2) and xi1 = NS(xi2)
when 1 ≤ i ≤ n, let lU˜n , rU˜n : U˜n × U˜n → U˜n be the projections given by:
lU˜n (x˜)= (x11, x21,... xn1) and rU˜n (x˜)= (x12, x22,... xn2).	(6)
Consider the order relation x˜ ≤U˜ y˜ given by x1 ≤ y1 and x2 ≥ y2 such that
˜0= (0, 1) ≤U˜ x˜ and ˜1= (1, 0) ≥U˜ x˜, for all x˜, y˜ ∈ U˜ [1].
The complement, intersection and union, implication and coimplication, differ- ence and codifference operations are reported in the following.

Complement operation
An intuitionistic fuzzy negation (IFN) is a function NI : U˜ → U˜ verifying:
[N1I]: If NI (˜0) = NI (0, 1) = ˜1 and NI (˜1) = NI (1, 0) = ˜0;
[N2I]: If x˜ ≥U˜ y˜ then NI (x˜) ≤U˜ NI (y˜), for all x˜, y˜∈ U˜.
And, NI is a strong intuitionistic fuzzy negation (SIFN) if it is also an involutive function:
[N3I]: NI (NI (x˜)) = x˜, ∀x˜ ∈ U˜.

In this work, we consider the standard intuitionistic fuzzy negation expressed as
:
NIS (x˜)= NIS ((x1, x2)) = (x2, x1), for all x˜ = (x1, x2) ∈ U˜.	(7)
Definition 2.1 Let NI be an IFN and AI be IFS. The complement of AI with respect to U˜ is a IFS indicated as AjI and given by
AjI = {(x, NI (μAI (x), νAI (x))) : x ∈ X}.	(8)
By the representation theorem [15], a SIFN NI on U˜ can be given as
NI (μAI (x), νAI (x)) = (N (NS(νAI (x)), NS(N (μAI (x))).	(9)
Additionally, when NS = N in Eq.(9), NI = NIS.
Union and intersection operations
A function (SI )TI : U˜2  U˜ is a fuzzy triangular (co)norm (t-(co)norm shortly), if it is a commutative, associative and increasing function with neutral element (˜0) ˜1, meaning that for all x˜, y˜, z˜ ∈ U˜, the following properties hold:
[TI1]: TI (x˜, ˜1) = x˜;	[SI2]: SI (x˜, ˜0) = x˜;
[TI2]: TI (x˜, y˜)= TI (y˜, x˜);	[SI2]: SI (x˜, y˜)= SI (y˜, x˜));
[TI3]: TI (x˜, TI (y˜, y˜)) = TI (TI (x˜, y˜), y˜);	[SI3]: SI (x˜, SI (y˜, z˜)) = SI (SI (x˜, y˜), z˜));
[TI4]: if x˜ ≤ x˜j, y˜ ≤ y˜j, TI (x˜, y˜) ≤ TI (x˜j, y˜j).  [SI4]: if x˜ ≤ x˜j,y˜ ≤ y˜j, SI (x˜, y˜) ≤ SS(x˜j, y˜j).
Based on results of [16, Definition 3], an intuitionistic t-norm (SI )TI : U˜2 → U˜ is t-representable if there exist a t-norm T : U 2 → U and a t-conorm S : U 2 → U such that T (x, y) ≤ NS(S(NS(x), NS(y))), it is given as:
TI (x˜, y˜)= TI ((x1, x2), (y1, y2)) = (T (x1, y1), S(x2, y2));	(10)
SI (x˜, y˜)= SI ((x1, x2), (y1, y2)) = (S(x1, y1),T (x2, y2)).	(11)
We consider both intuitionistic aggregations: the Product t-norm TIP and Alge- braic Sum SIP , respectively described by Eqs. (12) and (13), for all x˜ = (x1, x2), y˜ = (y1, y2) ∈ U˜ in the following:
TIP (x˜, y˜)= (TP (x1, y1), SP (x2, y2));	(12)
SIP (x˜, y˜)= (SP (x1, y1), TP (x2, y2)).	(13)
Definition 2.2 Let SI, TI : U˜2 → U˜ be an intuitionistic fuzzy t-norm (IFT)
and t-conorm (IFS). The intersection and union between the IFSs AI and BI , both defined with respect to x ∈ X and such that x˜ = (μAI (x), νAI (x)), y˜ = (μBI (x), νBI (x)) ∈ U˜, resulting in the corresponding intuitionistic fuzzy sets:
AI ∩ BI = {(x, (μAI∩BI (x), νAI∩BI )(x))) : x ∈ X};	(14)
AI ∪ BI = {(x, (μAI∪BI (x), μAI∩BI (x))) : x ∈ X}.	(15)
By the t-representability [15, Definiton 5] of an IFT and IFS in terms ofa t-norm
T and a t-conorm S, Eqs. (14a) and (14b) can be expressed as:

AI ∩ BI = {(x,T (μAI (x), μBI (x)), S(νAI (x), νBI (x))) : x ∈ X};	(16)
AI ∪ BI = {(x, S(μAI (x), μBI (x)),T (νAI (x), νBI (x))) : x ∈ X}.	(17)

In the following, by taking x˜
= (x1, x2) and y˜
= (y1, y2) such that μAI (x) =

x1, νAI (x) = x2, μBI (x) = y1, νAI (x) = y2 ∈ U the MFs and NMFs related to the
intersection and union of IFSs AI and BI in Eqs.(16) and (17) are, respectively, given as:
μAI∩BI (x) = x1 · y1;	νAI∩BI (x) = x2 + y2 − x2 · y2;	(18)
μAI∪BI (x) = x1 + y1 − x1 · y1;  νAI∪BI (x) = x2 · y2.	(19)
Difference and codifference operations
According with [17], the difference between IFSs A and B is given by
A − B = {(μA−B(x), νA−B(x))|x ∈ χ, 0 ≤ μA−B(x)+ νA−B(x) ≤ 1}
where μA−B, νA−B : χ → U are the membership and non-membership function of x ∈ χ in the A-IFS A − B. By [17, Definition 3] an A-IFS A − B can be expressed as:
DI ((μA(x), νA(x)), (μB(x), νB(x))) = (μA−B(x), νA−B(x)).
The next definition extends the results in [18]:
Definition 2.3 [17, Definition 4] DI (EI ) : U˜2 → U˜ is an Atanassov intuitionistic
fuzzy (co)difference (A-IFD (A-IFE)) if it satisfies the following axioms:
[DI1]: DI (x˜, y˜) ≤ x˜;	[EI1]: EI (x˜, y˜) ≥ x˜;
[DI2]: DI (x˜, ˜0) = x˜;	[EI2]: EI (x˜, ˜1) = x˜;
[DI3]: If y˜ ≤ z˜, DI (x˜, y˜) ≥ DI (x˜, z˜);	[EI3]: If y˜ ≤ z˜, EI (x˜, y˜) ≥ EI (x˜, z˜);
[DI4]: If x˜ ≤ y˜, DI (x˜, z˜) ≤ DI (y˜, z˜));	[EI4]: If x˜ ≤ y˜, EI (x˜, z˜) ≤ EI (y˜, z˜));
[DI5]: DI (˜1, x˜)= NI (x˜), NI is a IFN;	[EI5]: EI (˜0, x˜)= NI (x˜), NI is a IFN.
Proposition 2.4 For all x˜, y˜ ∈ U, the operator DI 1(EI 1): U 2 → U given by
DI 1(x˜, y˜)= (TI (x˜, NI (y˜));	(20)
EI 1(x˜, y˜)= (SI (x˜, NI (y˜)).	(21)
is an intuitionistic fuzzy (co)difference operator in the sense of Proposition2.3.
Proof Straightforward.	2
Proposition 2.5 Let TI(SI) be a representable A-IFT (A-IFS). A function DI (EI ) : U 2 → U in Eq.(20) and (21) can be expressed, for all x˜ = (x1, x2), y˜ = (y1, y2) ∈ U˜, as follows:
DI (x˜, y˜)= (T (x1, y2), S(x2, y1));	(22)
EI (x˜, y˜)= (S(x1, y2),T (x2, y1)).	(23)
Proof It follows from Eq.(10a) (Eq.(10b)).	2

Example 2.6 By Eqs.(10) and (11) and results in Proposition 2.5, we have that:
DTP ,NS I (x˜, y˜)= (x1y2, x2 + y1 − x2y1);	(24)
ESP ,NSI (x˜, y˜)= (x1 + y2 − x1y2, x2y1),	(25)
is a representable A-IFT (A-IFS) obtained by the t-(co)norm TP (SP ) and standard negation NS.
Fuzzy intuitionistic (co)implications
The Atanassov’s intuitionistic approach of fuzzy (co)-implications is considered in the following, discussing properties and projection functions in order to define rep- resentable fuzzy (co)-implications.
Definition 2.7 An intuitionistic fuzzy (co)implicator ((A-IFC) A-IFI) (JI )II :
U˜2 → U˜ is a binary function verifying the boundary conditions:
[II1]: II (˜0, ˜0) = II (˜0, ˜1) = II (1˜, ˜1) = ˜1 and II (˜1, ˜0) = ˜0; [JI1]: JI (˜0, ˜0) = JI (˜1, ˜0) = JI (˜1, ˜1) = ˜0 and JI (˜0, ˜1) = ˜1;
Definition (2.7) can be reduced to a fuzzy (co)implication if x˜ = (x1, x2) and y˜ = (y1, y2) ∈ U˜, such that x1 = NS(x2) e y1 = NS(y2) [1]. Intuitionistic fuzzy (co)-implications are defined in the sense of J. Fodor and M. Roubens [19,20].

Definition 2.8  An ((A-IFC) A-IFI) (JI )II : U 2 → U˜
the conditions described as follows:
satisfies, for all x˜, y˜, z˜ ∈ U˜,

[II2]: x˜ ≤ z˜⇒ II (x˜, y˜) ≥ II (z˜, y˜);	[JI2:] x˜ ≤ z˜⇒ JI (x˜, y˜) ≥ JI (z˜, y˜);
[II3]: y˜≤ z˜⇒ II (x˜, y˜) ≤ II (x˜, z˜);	[JI3]: y˜≤ z˜⇒ JI (x˜, y˜) ≤ JI (x˜, z˜); [II4]: II (˜0, y˜)= ˜1;	 [JI4:] JI (˜1, y˜)= ˜0;
[II5]: II (x˜, ˜1) = ˜1;	[JI5]: JI (x˜, ˜0) = ˜0;
In this work, for all x˜ = (x1, x2), y˜ = (y1, y2) ∈ U˜, we consider the Reichenbach intuitionistic fuzzy S-(co)implication:
IRCI (x˜, y˜)= SP I (NSI (x˜), y˜)= (x2 + y1 − x2y1, x1y2)	(26)
JRCI (x˜, y˜)= TP I (NSI (x˜), y˜)= (x2y1, x1 + y2 − x1y2)	(27)
which can be defined based on Eqs.(4) and (5), respectively.

Obtaining intuitionistic fuzzy sets from quantum computing
Firstly, quantum computing concepts are reported.
Basic concepts of quantum computing
In QC, the qubit is the basic information unit, being the simplest quantum sys- tem, defined by a unitary and bi-dimensional state vector. Qubits are generally described, in Dirac’s notation [21], by |ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩, and the coefficients α

and β are complex numbers for the amplitudes of the corresponding states in the computational basis (state space), respecting the condition |α|2 + |β|2 = 1, which guarantees the unitary of the state vectors of the quantum system, represented by (α, β)t [22].
The state space of a quantum system with multiple qubits is obtained by the tensor product of the space states of its subsystems. Considering a quantum system with two qubits, |ψ⟩ = α|0⟩+β|1⟩ and |ϕ⟩ = γ|0⟩+δ|1⟩, the state space comprehends the tensor product given by

|Π⟩ = |ψ⟩⊗ |ϕ⟩ = α · γ|00⟩ + α · δ|01⟩ + β · γ|10⟩ + β · δ|11⟩.

The state transition of a quantum systems is performed by controlled and unitary transformations associated with orthogonal matrices of order 2N , with N being the number of qubits within the system, preserving norms, and thus, probability amplitudes [23].
For instance, the definition of the Pauly X transformation and its application over a one-dimensional and two-dimensional quantum systems are presented in Eq. (28).

⎛ 0 0 0 1 ⎞ ⎛ α · γ ⎞	⎛ α · γ ⎞


⎝ 1 0 ⎠ ⎝ β ⎠
⎝ α ⎠

0 1 0 0	β  γ
1 0 0 0 ⎠ ⎝ β · δ ⎠

β  δ
⎝ β · γ ⎠
(28)

Furthermore, a Toffoli transformation is also shown in Eq. (3.1), describing a controlled operation for athree dimensional quantum system. In this case, the NOT operator (Pauly X ) is applied to the third qubit |σ⟩ when the current states of the first two qubits |ψ⟩ and |ϕ⟩ are both |1⟩.
Similarly to qTs of multiple qubits which were obtained by the tensor product performed over unitary transformations, Eq. (3.1) presents the matrix structure defining such transformation, when |X⟩ is the initial state:
In order to obtain information from a quantum system, it is necessary to apply measurement operators, defined by a set of linear operators Mm, called projections. The index m refers to the possible measurement results. If the state of a quantum system is |ψ⟩ immediately before the measurement, the probability of an outcome

occurrence is given by p(|ψ⟩) = √
Mm|ψ⟩
⟨ψ|MmMm|ψ⟩
. When measuring a qubit |ψ⟩ with

α, β /= 0, the probability of observing |0⟩ and |1⟩ are, respectively, given by the
following expressions:
p(0)=⟨φ|M0†M0|φ⟩=⟨φ|M0|φ⟩=|α|2 and p(1)=⟨φ|M1†M1|φ⟩=⟨φ|M1|φ⟩=|β|2.

⎛ 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ⎞ ⎛ α ⎞ ⎛ α ⎞
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0	β	β
0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0		γ	γ T	=	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0		 δ = δ 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0	ϵ	ϵ
0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0	θ	θ
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1	υ	σ
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 ⎠ ⎝ σ ⎠ ⎝ υ ⎠
After the measuring process, the quantum state |ψ⟩ has |α|2 as the probability to be in the state |0⟩ and |β|2 as the probability to be in the state |1⟩.
Interpreting FS Operations from Quantum Transformations
According to [4], fuzzy sets can be interpreted by quantum superposition of classical fuzzy sets (CFSs) associated with quantum states. Additionally, interpretations for fuzzy operations such as complement, intersection and union are obtained from the NOT , AND and OR quantum transformations.
In order to simplify the paper notation, the MD defined by μA(x), which is related to an element x ∈X in the FS A, will be denoted by μA.
The modelling of fuzzy complement, intersection and union (NOT , AND and OR operators) are defined in [10] and summarized below. For that, let μA, μB : X → [0, 1] be membership functions (MFs) related to FSs A and B.
The corresponding pair (|SμA ⟩, |SμB ⟩) of CFSs is given as:
|SμA ⟩ = √μA(x)|1⟩ + √1 − μA(x)|0⟩,	(29)
|SμB ⟩ =  μB(x)|1⟩ +  1 − μB(x)|0⟩.	(30) respectively.
The complement of a FS is performed by the standard negation, which is obtained by the NOT operator, based on Eq.(9) and defined as
NOT (|SμA ⟩)= (√μA(x)|0⟩ + √1 − μA(x)|1⟩)	(31)

Moreover, when |SμA ⟩ = ⊗1≤i≤N   1 − μA(xi)|0⟩ +  μA(xi)|1⟩  the complement
operator NOTN preserves an N -dimensional quantum superposition of 1-qubit states described as C2 in the computational basis, and expressed by Eq. (32) below:
NOTN (|Sμ  ⟩)= ⊗1≤i≤N  √μA(xi)|0⟩ + √1 − μA(xi)|1⟩	(32)
Let |SμA ⟩ and |SμB ⟩ be quantum states given by Eqs. (29) and (30).
The intersection and union of FSs A and B are modelled by the AND and

OR operators which are respectively expressed through the Toffoli transforma- tion as below:
AND(|SμA ⟩, |SμB ⟩)=T (|SμA ⟩, |SμB ⟩, |0⟩)	(33)
OR(|SμA ⟩, |SμB ⟩)=NOT  (T (NOT|SμA ⟩,N OT|SμB ⟩, |0⟩)).	(34)
The fuzzy implication and coimplication of FSs A and B, are modelled by the IMP and COIMP operators which are respectively expressed through compo- sition of NOT and Toffoli transformations as in the following:
IMP (|SμA ⟩, |SμB ⟩)=T (|SμA ⟩,N OT|SμB ⟩, |1⟩).	(35)
COIMP (|SμA ⟩, |SμB ⟩)=T (NOT|SμA ⟩,|SμB ⟩, |0⟩)).	(36)
The fuzzy difference and codifference of FSs A and B, are also modelled by the DIF and CODIF operators respectively expressed through composition of NOT and Toffoli transformations as follows:
DIF (|SμA ⟩, |SμB ⟩)=T (|SμA ⟩,N OT|SμB ⟩, |0⟩)).	(37)
CODIF (|SμA ⟩, |SμB ⟩)=T (NOT|SμA ⟩,|SμB ⟩, |1⟩)).	(38)

Interpreting CIFs from quantum states
The description of IFSs from the QC viewpoint extends the work in [4] by modelling an element x˜ ∈ AI which is given by x˜ = (μAI (x), νAI (x)), such that x ∈ χ /= ∅, by a pair of quantum register (|SμAI ⟩, |SνAI ⟩) and fuzzy operators by quantum transformations.
Let X be a non-empty subset with cardinality N , meaning that X /= ∅, |X | = N and i ∈ NN = {1, 2, ..., N}. Let μAI , νAI : X → [0, 1] × [0, 1] be the MF and NMF related to an element xi ∈ X in the IFSs AI , respectively, and μAI (xi), νAI (xi) be their corresponding MD and NMD.
Definition 4.1 A classical intuitionistic fuzzy set (CIFS) of N-qubits is a pair of N -dimensional quantum states, given by
(|SμAI ⟩, |SνAI ⟩)= 

			

⎝1≤i≤N
such that μAI (xi)+ νAI (xi) ≤ 1.
1≤i≤N	⎠

A pair of CIFSs of N-qubits is an N -dimensional quantum state given by Eq.(39). Taking N1, μAI (x1) = x1, νAI (x1) = x2 and x1, x2 ∈]0, 1[, the quantum states corresponding to IFSs are obtained and expressed as
 |SμAI ⟩, |SνAI ⟩ = √x1|1⟩ + √1 − x1|0⟩, √x2|1⟩ + √1 − x2|0⟩	(40) Moreover, by taking N2 and μAI (xi) = x1i, νAI (xi) = x2i ∈]0, 1[, the related
  

|SμAI ⟩ = (√x11|1⟩ + √1 − x11|0⟩) ⊗ (√x12|1⟩ + √1 − x12|0⟩)= 
=√(1 − x11)(1 − x12)|00⟩+√(1 − x11)x12|01⟩+√x11(1 − x12)|10⟩+√x11x12|11⟩;


| νAI ⟩	21| ⟩	− 21| ⟩ ⊗	22| ⟩	−  22| ⟩

An application of an IMF fI to each element in the image-set fI [X ] defines a quantum state. Thus, a canonical orthonormal basis in ⊗N C× ⊗N C denotes a pair of classical quantum registers of N -qubits, meaning that μAI (xi), νAI (xi) ∈ {0, 1} in Eq.(39).

Interpreting IFS operations from quantum transfor- mations
In the following, the composition of QTs applied to quantum registers also in- cludes an interpretation based on results obtained by the quantum measurement operations. Moreover, fuzzy operators are considered to obtain the corresponding modelling of IFS operation as a composition of QTs applied to quantum registers

Modelling IFS complement operator by QTs
The complement operator NOTIN applied to the state in an N -dimensional quantum superposition of 1-qubit states as described in Eq.(39), is given by

NOTIN (|Sμ
⟩, |SνAI
⟩)= 


			
⎝1≤i≤N	1≤i≤N	⎠
By restricting a CIFs as the pair of one-dimentional qubits as given in Eq.(40), the
complement operator of an IFS AI is modelled by the NOTI operator as:
NOTI  |SμAI ⟩, |SνAI ⟩  =  |SνAI ⟩, |SμAI ⟩	(42)
Modelling IFS intersection operation by QTs
Let AI and BI be IFSs both defined by μAI (x) = x1, νAI (x) = x2 and μBI (x) = y1, μBI (x) = y1 for x ∈ X . Consider the pairs of CIFSs of one-dimensional quantum registers given by Eqs. (43) and (44) in the following:
 |SμAI ⟩, |SνAI ⟩ = √x1|1⟩ + √1 − x1|0⟩, √x2|1⟩ + √1 − x2|0⟩	(43)
 |SμBI ⟩, |SνBI ⟩ = √y1|1⟩ + √1 − y1|0⟩, √y2|1⟩ + √1 − y2|0⟩	(44)
By making use of the Toffoli transformation, the intersection AI ∩ BI between the IFSs AI and BI , is defined by the ANDI operator and described in the fol- lowing:

ANDI   |SμAI ⟩, |SνAI ⟩ , |SμBI ⟩, |SνBI ⟩ 
= AND  |SμAI ⟩, |SμBI ⟩  , OR  |SνAI ⟩, |SνBI ⟩	(45)
Expanding the components of Eq.(45) based on the fuzzy operators in Eqs.(33) and (34), we firstly consider the AND operator also expressed through the Toffoli quantum transformation as given in the next expressions:
AND  |SμAI ⟩, |SμBI ⟩  = T  |SμAI ⟩, |SμBI ⟩, |0⟩  =
=T  (√x1|1⟩ + √1 − x1|0⟩) ⊗ (√y1|1⟩ + √1 − y1)|0⟩) ⊗ |0⟩) 
=(√1 −x1√1−y1|000⟩+(√1−x1√y1|010⟩+(√x1√1−y1|100⟩+(√x1√y1|111⟩)(46)
Thus, a measurement performed over the third qubit (|1⟩) in the first component of the final quantum state, which is expressed by Eq. (51), provides the output with probability pAND(1) = x1 · y1.
Analogously, a measurement of such third qubit (|0⟩) in Eq. (51), returns an output state given with probability pAND(0) = 1 − x1 · y1.
Now, by applying the composition between NOT 3 and Toffoli operators we are able to express OR(|SνAI ⟩, |SνAI ⟩) with similar calculations as the following:
3	 
OR(|SνAI ⟩, |SνAI ⟩)= NOT	T (NOT (|Sν	⟩),NOT (|SνAI ⟩), |0⟩)  =
=NOT 3(T ((√x2|0⟩ + √1 − x2|1⟩) ⊗ (√y2|0⟩ +	1 − y2|1⟩) ⊗ |0⟩))
=√x2y2|001⟩+	x2(1−y2)|011⟩+	(1−x2)y2|101⟩+	(1−x2)(1−y2)|110⟩	(47)
Observing a measure of the quantum state given in Eq. (50) performed on the third qubit :

related to |1⟩, returns √
1
x2+y2−x2y2
 √x2y2|001⟩+√x2(1−y2)|011⟩+√(1−x2)y2|101⟩ 

and the corresponding probability pOR(1) = x2 + y2 − x2 · y2.
	related to |0⟩ results on |110⟩ with probability pOR(0) = (1 − x2) · (1 − y2). Based on Eqs. (51) and (50), it results in the state with corresponding compo-
nents probabilities (pAND(1), pOR(1)) which is related to Eq. (18),
(μAI∩BI (x), νAI∩BI (x)) = (x1 · y1, x2 + y2 − x2 · y2) interpreting MD of x ∈X belongs to the intersection AI ∩ BI .
Modelling IFS union operation by QTs
The union AI ∪ BI between the IFSs AI and BI both defined with respect to U˜, is analogously obtained. It is modelled by the ORI operator described as:
ORI  |SμAI ⟩, |SνAI ⟩ ,  |SμBI ⟩, |SνBI ⟩  =
 OR |SμAI ⟩, |SμBI ⟩ , AN D |SνAI ⟩, |SνBI ⟩	(48)
Similar to ANDI operator, the ORI operator described in Eq.(48) can also be obtained based on Eqs. (51) and (50), resulting the state with corresponding

components probabilities: (pOR(1), pAND(1)) which is related to Eq. (19) and given as follows:
(μAI∪BI (x), νAI∪BI (x)) = (x1 + y1 − x1 · y1, x2 · y2) interpreting the MD and NMD of an element x ∈X in the union AI ∪ BI .

Modelling IFS implication operation by QTs
By making use of the Toffoli transformation, the implication AI → BI between the
IFSs AI and BI , is defined by the IMPI operator and described in the following:
IMPI	  |SμAI ⟩, |SνAI ⟩ , |SμBI ⟩, |SνBI ⟩ 
=	 OR |SνAI ⟩, |SμBI ⟩ , AN D  |SμAI ⟩, |SνBI ⟩   (49)
Expanding the components of Eq.(52), we firstly consider the OR operator also expressed through the Toffoli QT as given in next expression:
OR(|SνAI ⟩, |SμBI ⟩)= T (NOT (|SνAI ⟩),NOT (|SμBI ⟩), |1⟩)= 
=T ((√x2|0⟩ + √1 − x2|1⟩) ⊗ (√y1|0⟩ + √1 − y1|1⟩) ⊗ |1⟩))
=√x2y1|001⟩+√x2(1−y1)|011⟩+√(1−x2)y1|101⟩+√(1−x2)(1−y1)|110⟩		 (50) Observing	a	measure	of	the	quantum	state	in	Eq.	(50)

performed

on	the

third	qubit
√	√
related	t o	|1⟩,	returns


sponding probability pOR(1) = x2 + y1 − x2 · y1. And, a measure operation related
to |0⟩ results on |110⟩ with probability pOR(0) = (1 − x2) · (1 − y1).
Now, by applying Toffoli QT we express AND(|SμAI ⟩, |SνBI ⟩) in a similar way:
AND  |SμAI ⟩, |SνBI ⟩  = T  |SμAI ⟩, |SνBI ⟩, |0⟩  =
=√1−x1√1−y2|000⟩+√1−x1√y2|010⟩+√x1√1−y2|100⟩+(√x1√y2|111⟩	(51)
Thus, a measurement performed over the third qubit (|1⟩) in the first component of the final quantum state, which is expressed by Eq. (51), provides the output with probability pAND(1) = x1 · y2. Analogously, a measurement of such third qubit (|0⟩) in Eq. (51), returns an output state given with probability pAND(0) = 1 − x1 · y2.
Based on Eqs. (51) and (50), it results in the state with corresponding components probabilities (pOR(1), pAND(1)) such that (μAI→BI (x), νAI→BI (x)) = (x2 + y1 − x2 · y1, x1 · y2) interpreting MD of x ∈ X belongs to the intuitionistic implication AI → BI .

Modelling IFS coimplication operation by QTs
By making use of the Toffoli transformation, the co-implication AI → BI between the IFSs AI and BI , is defined by the COIMPI operator and described in the following:

COIMPI   |SμAI ⟩, |SνAI ⟩ , |SμBI ⟩, |SνBI ⟩  =
 AND |SνAI ⟩, |SμBI ⟩ , OR |SμAI ⟩, |SνBI ⟩	(52) Finally, analogous calculations result in the state with corresponding compo-
nents probabilities (pAND(1), pOR(1)) such that
(μAI→BI (x), νAI→BI (x)) = (x2 · y1, x1 + y2 − x1 · y2)
= (pAND(0), pOR(0))
interprets MD of x ∈X belongs to the intuitionistic co-implication AI → BI .

Modelling IFS difference operation by QTs
The difference AI − BI between IFSs AI and BI both defined with respect to U˜, is analogously obtained. It is modelled by the DIFI operator described as:
DIFI   |SμAI ⟩, |SνAI ⟩  ,  |SμBI ⟩, |SνBI ⟩  =
 AND  |SμAI ⟩, |SνBI ⟩  , OR  |SνAI ⟩, |SμBI ⟩	(53)
Therefore, a measure performed over the operator DIFI results on state with corresponding components probabilities (pAND(1), pOR(1)) which is related to Eq. (24) and given as follows,
(pAND(0), pOR(0)) = (1 − x1 · y1, 1 − x2 − y2 + x2 · y2)
= (μ(A−B)(x), ν(A−B)(x))	(54)
interpreting the MD and NMD of an element x ∈X in the difference AI − BI .

Modelling IFS codifference operation by QTs
The codifference operation AI c BI between IFSs AI and BI both defined with respect to U˜, is analogously obtained. It is modelled by the CODIFI operator described as:
CODIFI  |SμAI ⟩, |SνAI ⟩ , |SμBI ⟩, |SνBI ⟩  =
 OR |SμAI ⟩, |SνBI ⟩ , AN D |SνAI ⟩, |SμBI ⟩			(55) Analogously	the	above	operators,	the	measure	performed	over		the
CODIFI operator results on state with corresponding components probabilities
(pOR(1), pAND(1)) which is related to Eq. (25) as the follows:
(pAND(0), pOR(0)) = (1 − x1 · y1, 1 − x2 − y2 + x2 · y2)
= (μ(A−cB)(x), ν(A−cB)(x))	(56)
It provides interpretation to the MD and NMD of an element x ∈ X in the codif- ference AI −c BI .

Conclusion and Final Remarks
This work is mainly focussed on the interpretation of Atanassov’s intuitionistic fuzzy logic via QC, where not only the intuitionistic fuzzy sets but also complement, inter- section, union, difference and codifference operations are interpreted based on the quantum circuit model, including IFSs obtained by representable (co)implications. Further work aims to consolidate this specification including not only other fuzzy connectives but also constructors (e.i. automorphisms and reductions) and the corresponding extension of (de)fuzzyfication methodology from formal structures
provided by QC.
