ABSTRACT: Cities are increasingly vital in global carbon mitigation efforts, yet few have
specifically tailored carbon neutrality pathways. Furthermore, out-of-boundary indirect
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, aside from those related to electricity and heat imports,
are often overlooked in existing pathways, despite their significance in comprehensive
carbon mitigation strategies. Addressing this gap, here we introduce an integrated analysis
framework focusing on both production and consumption-related GHG emissions. Applied

to Wuyishan, a service-oriented city in Southern China, this framework provides a holistic

view of a city's carbon neutrality pathway, from a full-scope GHG emission perspective.

The findings reveal the equal importance of carbon reduction within and outside the city’s

boundaries, with out-of-boundary emissions accounting for 42% of Wuyishan's present

total GHG emissions. This insight highlights the necessity of including these external

factors in GHG accounting and mitigation strategy development. This framework serves

as a practical tool for cities, particularly in developing countries, to craft effective carbon

neutrality roadmaps that encompass the full spectrum of GHG emissions.

1. INTRODUCTION
The rapid acceleration of global climate warming, which has pushed temperatures 1.2
°C above 1850–1900 levels [1] exacerbated the urgency [2] of achieving the Paris
Agreement targets, which is to keep warming to well below 2 °C and strive for a target of
1.5 °C [3]. As the world’s largest energy consumer and carbon emitter [4], China
announced ambitious targets to reach a carbon peak by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060
[5]. This commitment is expected to lower global warming projections by around 0.2–0.3

°C [6]. To implement national strategies, China established a “1+N” policy framework to

decompose industrial and sub-national participation [7]. As sub-national actors, cities are

the primary units in China’s administrative system that formulate and implement measures

[8], creating a promising opportunity to assist mitigation efforts [9]. On the other hand,

pursuing carbon neutrality will help cities upgrade low-carbon technologies and cultivate

a sustainably developed industrial chain. As China’s urbanization advances, the net-zero

emission transition of cities becomes a key to achieving carbon neutrality in the country.

Promoting and implementing cities’ carbon neutrality commitments require a

concrete and feasible roadmap to guide governments [10]. Over 10,000 cities worldwide

have committed to climate mitigation, adaptation, and financing actions [11]. Furthermore,
235 cities have proposed carbon neutrality [12]. To regulate and monitor these

commitments, several voluntary transnational climate initiatives have been established [13-

15]. However, many of those initiatives only require reports on commitments [16],

resulting in cities facing a dearth of technical support for devising localized strategies for

emissions reduction and detailed abatement measures [17]. The heterogeneity of national,

industrial,  and  urban  responses  to  the  environmental  systems,  for  instance,  the

differentiated accessibility of offsetting carbon emissions [18], results in the inability to

directly replicate global or national carbon abatement roadmaps on cities [16]. Therefore,

city-specific carbon-neutral pathways need to be developed based on local characteristics

of the economic structure, technological potential, and resource endowment (including

renewable energy resources and carbon removal potentials) [19].
For policymakers, achieving a comprehensive understanding of emission inventory
[20-24] and designing the city-level carbon emission pathway and control strategies [25]
hold equal importance. Yet, full-scope carbon emissions still lack concerns when pursuing
carbon-neutral cities [26]. According to the greenhouse gas (GHG) protocol, the sources

and boundaries for city-level GHG emission inventory include scope 1, scope 2, and scope

3 emissions [27, 28] (Fig. 1) (detailed definitions in Supplementary Information). Scope 1

and scope 2 emissions are referred to as territorial or production-based GHG emissions and

are usually reported and supervised by municipal authorities. Full-scope emissions cover

territorial and out-of-boundary supply chain (scope 3) emissions, providing a more

comprehensive picture of urban emissions for deep decarbonization. While cities’

territorial emissions are well understood, the out-of-boundary emissions embodied in

consumption are not comprehensively reported in the accounting inventories [16]. A few

city-level studies [29-32] explored scope 3 emissions, yet they generally focused on the

status quo, lacking a systematic approach for policy design to comprehensively and

objectively assess future emission pathways. In addition, few international climate

initiatives require municipalities to make commitments to address out-of-boundary

emissions [16].

In the realm of urban environmental commitments, there is a conspicuous absence of

explicit reduction pledges related to consumption or supply chain factors at the city level.

Consequently, it has become increasingly important to establish comprehensive emission

neutrality pathways tailored specifically to cities. Most cities import electricity, fuels,

water, food, and construction materials for their basic supply systems [33]. Consequently,

consumption-based emissions account for a considerable carbon footprint, especially for
service-oriented cities. Policies that ignore consumption-based emissions may have the
opposite effect from the original intentions [34]; affluent service-oriented cities may
outsource emission-intensive industries to less developed regions, resulting in potential
carbon leakage by cross-border product transfers. In contrast, policies that deal with full-

scope emissions allow wealthier cities to subsidize emission reductions in nearby energy-

producing towns and ensure a leading demonstration [35]. Therefore, including out-of-

boundary emissions when evaluating a city’s emissions and planning its reduction

pathways is necessary.

To fill the gaps, we focus on the city-level full-scope emissions and establish an

integrated methodology of GHG emission accounting and reduction pathway design. To

be more detailed, we calculate a city’s full-scope emissions based on sub-sectoral modules

and life cycle assessments and propose future carbon neutrality pathways using the Chinese

Academy of Environmental Planning Carbon Pathways (CAEP-CP) model [36]. We chose

Wuyishan city as our case study, which is located in Fujian province, China (see Fig. S1).

Wuyishan city pledges to be a pilot city for carbon peak and carbon neutrality in China. It

is also a typically service-orientated city. With the continuous industry structure transition,

the proportion of the tertiary industry will further increase, suggesting the increasing

importance of analyzing carbon mitigation strategy in service-orientated cities. This

study’s methodology provides a portable precedent for other cities, especially in


111

112
developing countries, in planning a carbon neutrality roadmap.


2. MATERIAL AND METHODS

This study framework that projected the full-scope carbon neutrality pathway in
Wuyishan city included three parts: emission accounting, pathway projection, and
uncertainty analysis (see Supplementary Fig. S2).
2.1. Emission accounting
In this paper, the hybrid analysis [37-39] method was used to calculate full-scope

GHG emissions for Wuyishan city. The hybrid analysis integrated the advantages of the

top-down model (emission inventory method) and the bottom-up model (process analysis

method), thereby unifying these two methods in the same analytical framework [40].

According to the Kyoto Protocol, GHGs mainly encompass six types, i.e., carbon dioxide
(CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and

sulfur hexafluoride. The contribution of varying GHGs to global warming was reflected by

global warming potential (GWP), which was finally expressed as carbon dioxide

equivalent (CO2eq).

Scope 1 emissions were determined following the Intergovernmental Panel on

Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines (2006) [41], including fossil fuel combustion, industrial

processes and product use, waste, agriculture, forestry, and other land uses (AFOLU).

Several city departments were involved in fossil fuel combustion, including energy,

industry, transportation, and building sectors, as classified according to the 2019

Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National GHG Inventory [42]. In this work,

industrial process emissions were not included in scope 1 emission estimation as all

industrial enterprises in Wuyishan city did not involve such processes. In addition, the

treatment of solid waste, domestic sewage, and industrial wastewater in Wuyishan city,

which was conducted outside the city, was incorporated into our scope 3 emission
calculations. Agriculture emissions comprised the various facets of agricultural activities,
including manure management, enteric fermentation, rice cultivation, and planting soils.
The specific emission factors of agricultural activities were modified to fit Wuyishan’s
local situation.  AFOLU represented changes in GHG emissions  associated  with

agriculture, forestry, and other land use practices. Scope 2 emissions covered indirect GHG

emissions from imported electricity. Owing to regional variations in technical levels and
energy compositions, the grid emission factor (EFGrid) preferentially relied on the local grid
emission factor (Fujian provincial grid emission factor) [43]. Scope 3 emissions included
GHG emissions from the consumption of products purchased from outside the jurisdiction,
cross-border traffic, and waste disposal. Product consumption refers to the carbon
emissions from upstream production, processing, and transportation of products outside

the city boundaries (such as water, food, construction materials, fuel, and other consumer

goods). As the main sources of food-related emissions were water, grains, and meat [44],

the production far exceeded the consumption in Wuyishan city [45], and there were no

food-related emissions in scope 3. Cross-border transportation refers to emissions from

urban cross-border transportation, including long-distance vehicles (passenger and freight),

railway, marine, and aviation. It was generally calculated using the miles traveled method

[46], with GHG emissions equally divided between the departure and destination cities.

Lastly, waste emissions encompassed GHG emissions stemming from the landfill and

incineration treatment of municipal solid waste, domestic sewage treatment, and industrial

wastewater treatment.
GHG emissions of Wuyishan city were calculated as follows：
159	𝐺𝐻𝐺Total = 𝐺𝐻𝐺Scope1 + 𝐺𝐻𝐺Scope2 + 𝐺𝐻𝐺Scope3 = ∑ 𝐴𝐷𝑖,𝑗 × 𝐸𝐹𝑖,𝑗	（1）
where ADi,j represented the activity level (product or energy) of consumption j in scope
i; EFi,j represented the GHG emission factor for j; i represented scope 1, scope 2, or scope

3.

2.2. Emission pathway projection

In the analysis of the carbon neutral pathway in Wuyishan, the future development

characteristics of Wuyishan city were considered to set basic socio-economic parameters.
The basic parameters, including population, economy, urbanization, and electricity
consumption, were projected according to government planning and existing literature (see
Table 1).

This study, employing the CAEP-CP model, took a comprehensive approach by

considering the socio-economic development and industrial development characteristics of

Wuyishan city. Furthermore, it aligned with the ambitious target of reaching a carbon

emission peak by 2030 in Fujian province, with Wuyishan city pioneering the province in

achieving the peak and neutralization (Fig. S2). This study investigated future emission

pathways of Wuyishan city under two scenarios with different levels of energy efficiency,

activity, energy structure, and resource endowment of future industries or sectors

(transportation, building, agriculture, industry, carbon sink, etc.). We first designed the

policy scenario that considered measures including accelerating the development of

renewable power, increasing the proportion of electric vehicles, and improving energy

efficiency and electrification of buildings. Additionally, more aggressive measures were

introduced under the low-carbon scenario, in which a faster development of renewable

power, a higher proportion of electric vehicles, and more prominent energy-saving

renovation and electrification of buildings were implemented. For scope 3 emissions, the
policy scenario only focused on measures on the demand side, while the low-carbon
scenario focused more on the consumption choices of residents, such as the government
and residents prioritizing the purchase and use of low-carbon products. In terms of forest
carbon sink, the policy scenario only considered the improvement of forest management.

However, the low-carbon scenario also considered the optimal restructuring of forest

structure.

To be detailed, the carbon emissions of each sector were determined by both the

activity level and the emission factor. Through the assumptions of emission reduction

measures, the activity level or emission factor of each sector could be predicted, thereby

allowing for the calculation of future carbon emissions in each sector.

For the energy sector, according to the requirements of the National Energy

Administration for the promotion of rooftop distributed photovoltaic projects in counties

and districts [49], the promotion of rooftop photovoltaics would be the main emission

reduction measure in Wuyishan city in the future. According to the potential calculation

based on the rooftop photovoltaic area, the total photovoltaic capacity of Wuyishan city

would be 337,600 kilowatts (Fig. S3b in the Supplemental Information). Correspondingly,

in the low-carbon scenario, we assumed that by 2025, 2035, and 2060, the installed

capacity of rooftop photovoltaics would reach 67,500 kilowatts, 242,000 kilowatts, and

337,600 kilowatts, respectively.

For the industry sector, since the tea industry was dominant in scope 1 and scope 2

emissions, we referred to the 14th Five-Year Plan for the tea industry in Wuyishan city

[50]. We assumed that the tea yield would reach 24,000 tons, 27,000 tons, and 33,000 tons

in 2025, 2035, and 2060, respectively, and we derived scope 1 and scope 2 energy
consumption to calculate GHG emissions. For scope 3 emissions, it was assumed that the
carbon emission factor per product unit would drop by 5% every five years by purchasing
low-carbon products, and the demand for products was predicted based on population
forecast.

For the transportation sector, fuel consumption, mileage, and emissions were

projected by forecasting the proportion of local vehicles (including private cars, buses, and

light-duty trucks) that were electric vehicles and the substitution rate of sustainable aviation

fuel [51, 52]. In the low-carbon scenario, the proportion of electric vehicles in Wuyishan

city would reach 20%, 60%, and 100% in 2025, 2035, and 2060, respectively. For scope 3

emissions, according to the tourism industry development plan [47], the number of tourists

was predicted to reach 20 million, 33 million, and 65 million in 2025, 2035, and 2060,

respectively. Sources of tourists and travel methods adopted the ratio of 2020, that was, the

proportion of tourists in the province and tourists from outside the province was 6:4. For

tourists from outside the province, 54%, 42%, and 4% of trips used high-speed rail, road,

and air travel, respectively. For tourists in the province, 33%, 67%, and 0% of trips used

high-speed rail, road, and air travel, respectively. The mileage was the average distance

from Wuyishan city to the corresponding city or provincial capital city. The carbon

emission factors per unit distance for high-speed rail, road, and air travel were referenced

from the report of the Chinese Academy of Engineering [53]. By 2025, 2035, and 2060,

these factors were projected to decrease by 25%, 50%, and 80%, respectively, compared

to 2020. These reductions were used to calculate the cross-border transportation GHG

emissions.

For the agriculture sector, based on the “Implementation Plan for Agricultural and
Rural Emission Reduction and Carbon Sequestration” [54], which mentioned “optimizing
paddy field irrigation management to reduce methane emissions from paddy fields”, we
assumed a decrease in methane emissions per unit of rice field yield of 25%, 70%, and 92%
in 2025, 2035, and 2060, respectively, compared to 2020. The future changes in rice

production and fertilizer usage were determined based on the forecast of the first industry

gross domestic product (GDP) to project GHG emissions.

For the building sector, we referenced the requirements in the “Fujian Province’s

Special Plan for Urban and Rural Infrastructure Construction in the 14th Five-Year Plan”

[55] and “Fujian Province Construction Industry 14th Five-Year Development Plan” [56].

It was assumed that the electrification rate of new buildings would be 100% in 2025 and

the electrification rate of existing buildings would reach 95% in 2035 and 100% in 2045.

In this way, we obtained energy consumption per unit building area. Together with future

building area data according to population forecast, emissions of the construction sector

can be calculated.

For the waste sector, we referenced the requirements in the “Accelerating the

Establishment and Improvement of the Implementation Plan for a Green, Low-Carbon, and

Circular Development Economic System in Fujian Province” [57] and the “Fujian

Province’s Long-term Special Plan for Waste-to-Energy Incineration (2019–2030)” [58].

We assumed that the carbon emission factor of a unit waste disposal would be reduced by

5% every five years, and the future waste generation was predicted by the population (per

capita waste generation remains unchanged), to obtain the GHG emission of waste

disposal.
2.3. Data Sources
Data used in this study were collected from three sources: yearbooks of statistics,
literature and documents, and government departmental survey data. Details could refer to
Supplementary Information Text. The emission factor of fossil energy combustion was
collected from the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (2006) [41],

product emission factor data were from the China Products Carbon Footprint Factors

Database [59], and grid emission factors were derived from the Ministry of Ecology and

Environment [60]. The GWP values came from the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report [9].

2.4. Uncertainty analysis

The uncertainty of GHG emission accounting mainly came from applied activity data

and emission factors. By referring to the IPCC guidelines [41], we adopted the methods of

quantifying the uncertainty for activity level and emission factor to determine the

probability distributions using the Monte Carlo simulation method. Equation (1) was used

in the simulation process, and each parameter was simulated for 10,000 trials. The detailed


265

266
process could be referred to in our previous study [61].


3. RESULTS

3.1. Full-scope GHG emissions in Wuyishan city

The full-scope GHG emissions in Wuyishan city were estimated as 1545.6 kt CO2eq

(90% confidence interval: 1386.6–1704.0 kt) in 2020, in which the non-CO2 emissions of

300.1 kt CO2eq (19.4%). Our results reveal that out-of-boundary (scope 3) emissions had

nearly equal weight to territorial emissions (scopes 1 and 2). Specifically, scope 1, scope

2, and scope 3 emissions contributed 48.5% (749.1 kt CO2eq), 9.9% (152.9 kt CO2eq), and

41.6% (642.6 kt CO2eq) of total GHG emissions, respectively; the carbon sink in Wuyishan

city was estimated as high as 830.9 kt CO2eq, which offset 54% of full-scope emissions.

Figure 2 shows the detailed breakdown of emissions for each scope with the sectoral
contribution.

The sectoral emission contribution showed significant differences between territorial

and out-of-boundary emissions (detailed data refer to Table S1). For territorial emissions,

agriculture (39.5%) and transportation (33.1%) sectors were the primary sources, followed

by building (23.6%) and industry (3.8%) sectors. Notably, the emissions in the agricultural

sector (357.0 kt CO2eq) were generally contributed by non-CO2 GHG (84.1%). With a high

share of primary industries (5.7% higher than the national average), rice cultivation and

livestock breeding were well developed, resulting in high CH4 (172.3 kt CO2eq) and N2O

emissions (116.0 kt CO2eq). High emissions in the transportation sector (289.6 kt CO2eq)

were mainly due to private vehicle ownership and freight transportation, among which

passenger vehicles, light freight, and motorcycles together contributed 84.7%. The building
sector was the third largest source (212.8 kt CO2eq), in which scope 1 emissions (104.7 kt

CO2eq) were about the same as scope 2 emissions (108.1 kt CO2eq). The building sector

consumed 76.5% of the city’s total electricity consumption in 2020, making it the leading

contributor to total scope 2 emissions.

The pattern of scope 3 emissions was related to the urban economy and industry

structure [62], mainly from the use of upstream raw materials and downstream waste

disposal. Among the 642.6 kt CO2eq out-of-boundary emissions, transportation (49.0%)

and industry (32.0%) stood out as the two major contributors. In 2020, Wuyishan city,

owning one of the five national parks in the territory, welcomed a substantial influx of
tourists, totaling 10.79 million visitors. This surge in tourism put more requirements on
cross-border transportation, leading to 315.2 kt CO2eq emissions. For the industry sector,

Wuyishan city was featured in tea-making and bamboo (accounting for 55.5% of the
industrial profit [45]). Due to the relatively homogeneous industrial enterprises within the

city, most enterprises purchased raw materials from outside the city, such as packaging
materials for tea-making, resulting in 114.3kt CO2eq scope 3 emissions. Besides,

construction materials, such as cement and steel, used in the building under construction
contributed to 91.3 kt CO2eq. Other sectors, including energy, agriculture, and waste,

together account for 19.0% of scope 3 emissions due to urban energy and fuel import,

agricultural fertilizer use, and municipal solid waste disposal.

In terms of carbon removal, the substantial increase in forest coverage to 80.5% in

Wuyishan city in 2020 [45] yielded a carbon sink of 830.9 kt CO2eq. This carbon sink was

mainly brought by the forest biomass stock, accounting for 77.5% of the total carbon sink,

followed by the soil organic matter stock (15.7%) and the forest dead organic matter stock

(6.8%) (Fig. S3a).

3.2. Pathway toward carbon neutrality in Wuyishan city

To facilitate the comparison with existing studies, future GHG emission pathways

constructed based on territorial (scopes 1 and 2) and full-scope (scopes 1, 2, and 3)

perspectives in Wuyishan city are discussed separately. Generally, both net territorial and

full-scope GHG emission (considering carbon removal) pathways show similar trends for

policy and low-carbon scenarios, which gradually increase and peak before 2030, followed

by a continuous decrease (Fig. 3).

Major mitigation measures under the policy scenario drive Wuyishan to achieve net
zero territorial emissions around 2045, 15 years ahead of China’s national target (2060).
Specifically, net territorial GHG emissions are projected to peak around 2028 (259.7 kt
CO2eq) and then decrease markedly in the following decades, declining to −7.3 and −172.0
kt CO2eq in 2045 and 2060, respectively (Fig. 3a, Table S2a). Such reductions underscore

the effectiveness of GHG controls, particularly in the building and agriculture sectors. In

the building sector, measures including promoting electrification and enhancing energy

efficiency are projected to yield remarkable results, with sectoral GHG emission reductions

of 85.0% in 2045 and a staggering 93.7% by 2060 (Table S2a). Similarly, in the agriculture
sector, due to effective controls on rice cultivation and fertilizer use, non-CO2 GHG
emissions (i.e., CH4 and N2O) will fall to 143.2 kt CO2eq in 2045 (52.3% lower relative to

2020 levels). As to carbon removal, given the relatively high forest coverage and mainly

mature tree species, the carbon sink will inevitably decline to 406.2 kt CO2eq in 2045,

compared with 830.9 kt CO2eq in 2020 (Table S2a). Despite the substantial reductions,

forest carbon sinks would still play a critical role in offsetting territorial GHG emissions

and achieving carbon neutrality.

When out-of-boundary emissions are considered, our results suggest that Wuyishan

city cannot achieve full scope neutrality under the policy scenario before 2060 (Fig. 3b).

Our estimates suggest that scope 3 emissions in Wuyishan will increase by 156.7 kt CO2eq

(24.4%) from 2020 to 2030, stabilize after 2030, and peak in 2035 (800.7 kt CO2eq), then

gradually decrease to 532.9 kt CO2eq in 2060 (Table S2a). Particularly, due to the expected

substantial increase in future tourism, the transportation sector would contribute to a 140.4

kt CO2eq increase in GHG emissions in 2035 compared to 2020. However, we anticipate

a downward trend after 2035, primarily due to nationwide initiatives, such as new vehicles
and the promotion of sustainable aviation fuel acceleration, which will reduce emissions
from residents traveling to Wuyishan from other regions. In contrast, with the development
of the tea industry, emissions from the industrial sector would continue to increase (by 44.9
kt CO2eq in 2060). This is largely attributed to the consumption of packaging materials.

Considering all these factors, net full-scope emissions in Wuyishan would peak around
2029, but still, 46.8% (333.3 kt CO2eq) of the 2020 emissions would be emitted in 2060,

miles away from the net zero target (Fig. 3b).

Fortunately, additional consumption-based measures, enhanced forestry management,

and renewable energy generation would help Wuyishan city achieve full-scope GHG

neutrality before 2060. Under the low-carbon scenario, net full-scope emissions in

Wuyishan will peak in 2026 at 851.5 kt CO2eq (three years earlier than in the policy

scenario with an 18.9% lower peak level) and reduce to −86.3 kt CO2eq in 2060 (Figs. 3d

and 4a, Table S2b).

For territorial emissions, our model shows that Wuyishan city is one of the highest

resource origins in Fujian Province for annual solar radiation, which is conducive to

promoting the development and construction of distributed photovoltaic (PV) power plants

(Fig. S3b). With 163.9 megawatts of installed PV capacity in Wuyishan city expected by

2030, 52.5 kt CO2eq is expected to be reduced per year, particularly in the building sector

(Fig. 4b). Besides, enhanced stringency on measures, including vehicle electrification

promotion (to 50% in the year 2030) and rice cultivation and fertilizer use controls, under

low-carbon scenario are expected to achieve additional 38.4 and 34.1 kt CO2eq GHG

mitigation benefits in the transportation and agriculture sectors, respectively, in 2030

compared to the policy scenario (Fig. 4b).
Furthermore, altering the tree species structure can effectively decelerate the decline
of carbon sink, ultimately resulting in increased carbon offsetting over the medium and
long term. This strategy emphasizes optimizing the tree species structure, involving
replacing mature trees with young saplings. The above measure will result in a short-term

decrease in carbon sinks brought by forest biomass stock, with no significant downward
advantage until 2030, which will be 6.0% lower than the policy scenario (−23.3 kt CO2eq).

However, in the long term, the carbon sink will stabilize after 2045 and reach 462.2 kt
CO2eq in 2060, 32.7% higher than the policy scenario (Fig. 4). Considering the mitigation

measures for territorial emissions and carbon sink in the low-carbon scenario, net territorial

emissions will neutralize around 2035 (about ten years earlier than in the policy scenario)

and fall to −389.0 CO2eq in 2060 (Fig. 3b).

For the considerable out-of-boundary emissions, a range of consumption-based

measures is available, which could be supported by the government of Wuyishan city to

achieve the full-scope neutrality goals (Fig. 4a). As Wuyishan city is still in continuous

economic growth, the urbanization process will continue to advance; tourism is on the rise,

and cross-border travel and transportation activities are becoming more frequent, leading

to the growing demand for passenger and freight transport. Passenger growth is the main

factor leading to the transportation scope 3 emission rise in a short period. But nationwide

full electrification penetration would accomplish an emission reduction of 145.7 kt CO2eq

in 2060 (Table S2). On the other side, due to the increasing consumption of building and

packaging materials from new construction, the industrial sector is the only sector

increasing scope 3 emissions after 2030 and will become the largest emitter (62.0%) in

scope 3 emissions by 2060. The low-carbon scenario encourages the use of lower-carbon
upstream raw materials for enterprises (including construction materials, such as cement
and steel, and other primary supplies) and the control of the entire industrial chain (such as
logistics transportation and product packaging brought by tea companies). As a result of
low-carbon upstream and downstream products and processes, the industrial sector would
reduce an additional 62.7 kt CO2eq emissions in 2060 compared to the policy scenario (Fig.

4b). Compared to the policy scenario, the stronger measures under the low-carbon scenario

are expected to achieve the full-scope neutrality goal before 2060 in Wuyishan (Figs. 3d

and 4).

4. CONCLUSIONS and DISCUSSIONS

Cities are fundamental administrative units in China to implement low-carbon

policies. This paper establishes an integrated methodology to account for city-level full-

scope emissions and assess the city’s carbon peak and neutrality pathways with scope 3

emissions incorporated. The efficacy of this methodology is demonstrated through a case

study of Wuyishan city, a typical service-orientated city in China. Notably, scope 3

emissions constitute a significant portion (42%) of the city's overall emissions, highlighting

the importance of addressing both internal and external sources for carbon reduction. When

it comes to full-scope GHG emissions, Wuyishan city is poised to achieve substantial

mitigation by 2025, primarily through strategies such as PV installation, 100% industrial

electrification, transitioning to electric vehicles, and waste incineration (Fig. 5). By 2035,

the city is set to witness a rapid expansion of PV installed capacity to 242,000 kW, along

with a 60% electric vehicle adoption rate. Additionally, an electrification rate of 95% is

targeted for buildings. In the agriculture sector, efforts will focus on reducing chemical

fertilizers and improving rice water irrigation management. All sectors must undergo
further low-carbon transition to achieve full-scope carbon neutrality before 2060. The PV
installed capacity needs to reach the maximum potential of 337,600 kW. Furthermore, the
electric vehicle and electrification rates of new buildings should reach 100%. The industry
sector should actively engage in mitigation efforts by purchasing low-carbon products,

while the transportation sector should focus on reducing emissions by incorporating

sustainable aviation fuels. Additionally, the waste sector needs a 35% reduction in waste

proposal GHG intensity.

Our study attempts to investigate full-scope GHG accounting and carbon pathway

planning for a city, which aligns with the current policy needs. The Chinese government is

vigorously promoting the establishment of a unified and standardized carbon emission

statistics and accounting system, which includes the extended measurement of implicit and

consumption-based emissions [63]. Scope 3 emissions are traditionally neglected in the

city’s GHG accounting, thereby underestimating urban emissions. It is insufficient to paint

a complete picture of urban GHG emissions or support the development of a sustainable

and low-carbon society. Our study finds that Wuyishan’s scope 3 emissions are about the

same as scope 1 and scope 2 emissions. For other cities, scope 3 emissions far exceed their

territorial emissions [30]. As the carbon neutrality target advances, many cities are

gradually transitioning towards tertiary industries and becoming service-oriented, which in

turn increases the scope 3 emissions significantly [64]. Accounting scope 3 emissions

makes it possible to fair compare the carbon neutrality targets of net producer cities and

net consumer cities.

Noticeable territory emission reductions are brought about by measures in various

fields, including vigorous electrification processes, energy efficiency improvement, and
the development of renewable energy generation [25]. Common paths to becoming a
carbon-neutral city include energy-efficient buildings, zero-carbon transportation, striving
for 100% renewable energy, and reducing waste and water [65]. In our study, Wuyishan
city attributes more than half of the emission reductions to electrification and renewable

energy development. Offsetting residual emissions is also a significant way [66, 67]. Cities

often have limited coverage and geological resources, which curtail their capacity to extract

carbon from the atmosphere and safely sequester it on a land base. The role of other forms

of carbon sequestration and offsetting becomes even more critical. Using nature-based

solutions, such as restoration and management of native ecosystems, emerges as a viable

avenue for creating a stable carbon sink while simultaneously promoting enhanced

biodiversity — an imperative for sustainable development [68]. Consequently, this

approach stands as a priority for offsetting choice. Additionally, in most cities, sectors like

coal power, waste incineration, and cement industries play pivotal roles in adopting carbon

capture technologies, although not applicable to Wuyishan city with the limited scales of

these industries. By partnering with carbon sequestration sites, cities could invest in

establishing carbon capture and sequestration chains to facilitate the deployment of large-

scale removals, achieving win-win results.

However, those traditional reduction measures have little effect on scope 3 emissions.

Emission reduction measures on the consumption side differ from those on the production

side, focusing more on low-carbon consumption by public participation and emission

control covering the industry chain. Mitigation measures, such as using upstream and

downstream low-carbon products, raising public awareness, changing lifestyles, and

enhancing low-carbon consumption, can bring considerable scope 3 emission reduction
benefits. These benefits, often underestimated, should be actively promoted for the future.
Carbon neutrality cannot be realized through the sole efforts of the management
department in implementing regulatory policies; rather, it necessitates the active
participation of all stakeholders, including the public sector, private sector, and citizens

[69, 70]. New industrial and economic development opportunities are essential drivers of

those stakeholders. Since scope 3 emissions occur outside the administrative boundaries of

cities, broader coordination among higher levels of governance (e.g., regional, national,

international) is required for net-zero consumption emissions, especially for systems that

operate on a larger scale, such as the power grid [71]. Collaborative initiatives like the

Covenant of Mayors can provide a valuable platform for small-sized cities to engage in

collaboration across different levels of government [72, 73]. Consequently, a city’s net-

zero goal for full-scope GHG emission helps to extend its influence and drive the entire

region or other cities nearby to improve reduction ambitions.

With Wuyishan city being one of the first pilot cities to reach the emission peak, the

results of this study hold immense value, offering operational, replicable, and extensible

experiences and practices, especially for service-orientated cities. This research strongly

supports future research on implicit carbon emission accounting on the consumption side.

However, there are still some limitations in this study. Data uncertainty and sensitivity

significantly impact the carbon footprint estimation, especially for scope 3 emissions.

Consequently, there is a compelling need for further reduction of such uncertainties.

Moreover, the uncertainty inherent in the emission accounting process arises from factors

like activity levels and emission factors, which cannot be overlooked [41]. To tackle this

issue, we measure and control the uncertainty range by considering the vital parameters’
probability distribution through a Monte Carlo approach. In the pathway projection, the
policy scenario assumptions strongly depend on the city’s future development plans, thus
generating substantial uncertainty. In this study, local and provincial governments’ macro
plans are investigated in detail to keep the scenario construction firmly grounded in reality.

Future research can continue to reduce the uncertainty in emissions accounting and future

scenario construction and seek more robust transition pathways in the highly uncertain

future. Although future scenarios are constructed and simulated based on macro policies

rather than cost-based optimization analyses, the cost is a critical factor to be considered

when developing mitigation strategies, which should be incorporated when implementing

the measures. Even with these limitations, our results are expected to shed light on full-

scope emission accounting and future pathway planning for cities in China and other

countries.

Highlights：

We propose a framework to investigate the city-level carbon neutrality pathway.
A full-scope GHG emission perspective is considered.
Carbon reductions within and outside city’s boundaries are equally important.
We suggest including out-of-boundary emissions in GHG accounting.
