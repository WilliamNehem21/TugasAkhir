The present study involves the development of certain thiazolo[3,2-a]pyrimidin-5-ones linked through an ethylene bridge to various amines. The newly synthesized compounds 4–6(a–c) were subjected to in vitro anticancer evaluation using NCI antitumor screening. The target compounds showed observed activity against Renal UO-31 cancer cell line with cell growth promotion 52.72–64.52%. COMPARE anal- yses revealed compounds 4a and 4b exhibiting high correlation levels with rapamycin (mTOR inhibitor).
Kinase assays were performed for compounds 4a and 4b on mTOR and structurally-related PI3Ka. They
displayed moderate activity against PI3Ka with IC50 values of 120 and 151 lM, respectively. Compounds 4a and 4b could thus be considered as a promising leading scaffold for further development of potential PI3Ka inhibitors.

Introduction

Fused thiazoles are an important class of compounds which have attracted much attention to make use of their remarkable bio- logical and pharmacological properties. Several publications have pointed to the antitumor activity of fused thiazole compounds
e.g. thiazolo[5,4-c]pyridin-4(5H)-one [1], and thiazolo[3,2-a] pyrimidine derivatives [2–5].
Based on these findings, and in continuation to our efforts to

synthesize biologically active compounds against cancer [6,7], we became interested in the evaluation of a series of thiazolo[3,2-a] pyrimidin-5-one derivatives with various substituents at the 3-, 6- and 7-positions, aiming at identifying potent anticancer agents. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway is an intracellu- lar signaling pathway that has regulatory roles in cell survival, pro- liferation, and differentiation, and a critical role in tumorigenesis [8,9]. In cancer, multiple studies have investigated the therapeutic targeting of the PI3K pathway, and multiple inhibitors targeting PI3K and its isoforms, protein kinase B/AKT, and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), have been developed [8]. A US patent reported thiazolopyrimidine compounds, substituted with a mor- pholine ring, of formulae I and II, with anticancer activity, and more specifically with PI3 kinase inhibitory activity. The com- pounds may inhibit tumor growth in mammals and may be useful
for treating human cancer patients [10].

Taking the above mentioned compounds as lead, a part of the research undertaken here involved the combination of a morpholi- noalkyl moiety with the thiazolo[3,2-a]pyrimidin-5-one series in a single molecular frame of the general structure (A) with the hope of finding interesting antitumor activity through inhibiting PI3K. A morpholine ring is often introduced to enhance water solubility. The group is attached through alkyl chain in order to protrude from the binding site and be exposed to the surrounding aqueous environment [11].

Moreover, it is well documented that aryl/heteroaryl sulfon- amides, where the nitrogen of -SO2NH2 group is either free or sub- stituted, exhibited substantial antitumor activity in vitro and/or in vivo [12–13]. The discovery of E-7010 [14] and vemurafenib (PLX4032) [15], fused heterocyclic compounds incorporating sul- fonamide moiety, emphasized the role of sulfonamides as an important class of anticancer agents which interact with a wide range of different cellular targets. In addition, series of novel com- pounds containing benzenesulfonamide moiety and incorporating benzoquinones [16], quinazolin-2-ones [17] or coumarins [18] have revealed promising anticancer activities.
In view of the preceding information, it was envisaged to con- struct a system which combines both thiazolo[3,2-a]pyrimidin-5- ones and sulfonamides in a single molecular frame (B), in order to explore the additive effects towards their anticancer activities.

Developmental Therapeutic Program (DTP). The operation of this screen utilizes 60 different human tumor cell lines, representing leukemia, melanoma and cancers of the lung, colon, brain, ovary, breast, prostate, and kidney. Structures are generally selected for screening based on their ability to add diversity to the NCI small molecule compound collection. Compounds with drug-like proper- ties based on computer-aided design are to be prioritized in the NCI screening service. All compounds submitted to the NCI 60 cell screen were tested initially at a single high dose (10—5 M) in the full NCI 60 cell panel. The compounds were added at a single concen- tration (10—5 M) and the culture was incubated for 48 h. End point determinations were made with a protein binding dye, Sulforho- damine B [23–25].
The mean percentage growth percentages and the growth per- centage with the most sensitive cell lines of all of the tested com- pounds over the full panel of cell lines are illustrated in Table 1.
In light of the NCI results, the following could be considered:

Regarding the sensitivity against individual cell lines in Table 1, all target compounds 4–6(a–c) showed observed low cell growth promotion against Renal UO-31cancer cell line with cell growth promotion varying from 52.72% to 64.52%.
By comparing the results from different series, it was found that the introduction of sulfacetamide in compounds 5a–c or

sulfaguanidine in compounds 6a–c instead of morpholine moi- ety in compounds 4a–c proved to enhance the potency towards Renal UO-31cancer cell line and reduce potency towards Leuke- mia SR cancer cell line.
It is worth mentioning that compounds 4–6(a) exhibited increased potency towards Leukemia SR cancer cell line and reduced the potency towards Non-Small Cell Lung HOP-92
cancer.

A general approach to synthesize the designed compounds 4–6 (a–c) is shown in Scheme 1. 2-Amino-4-arylthiazoles 2a–c were prepared utilizing either phenacyl chloride or bromide according to a reported procedure [19] which is considered to be an easy, rapid and purification-free procedure. Thiourea was allowed to
react with phenacyl halide at room temperature for 2–3 min to yield the corresponding arylthiazole. The reaction of 2a–c with a
-acetyl-c-butyrolactone in phosphorus oxychloride afforded 6-(2- chloroethyl)-7-methyl-3-(un)substituted phenyl-5H-thiazolo[3,2- a]pyrimidin-5-ones 3a–c without isolating the intermediates [20,21] in quantitative yields.
Heating compounds 3a–c with morpholine, sulfacetamide, and sulfaguanidine in dry DMF in the presence of triethylamine gave the corresponding target compounds 4–6(a–c) in moderate yields. The structures of the synthesized compounds 4–6(a–c) were confirmed by microanalyses and spectral data (IR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR and EI-MS) which showed full agreement with their structures. In the 1H NMR spectra of compounds 4a–c, the triplet signals of the morpholine ring protons resonated at the expected regions integrat- ing for eight protons. In the 13C NMR spectra of compound 4a, new bands appeared at 53.16 and 66.15 ppm, attributed to ((CH2)2N- morpholine) and ((CH2)2O-morpholine), respectively. For com-
pounds 5a–c, the aromatic protons (ANH-C6H4-SO2NHA) in the 1H
NMR spectra and the 13C signals of COCH3 and COCH3 in compound 5a were observed at the expected regions. The 13C signal for guani- dine moiety in compound 6a was observed at 159.23 ppm. The mass spectral data of the synthesized compounds 4–6(a–c) displayed molecular ion peaks which confirmed their molecular weights.

Biological evaluation

In vitro anticancer screening
The target compounds 4–6(a–c) were submitted to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) [22], Bethesda, Maryland, USA, under the

COMPARE analyses
We performed COMPARE [26] analyses for compounds 4–6(a–c) in order to investigate the similarity of their cytotoxicity pattern (mean graph fingerprints) with those of known anticancer stan- dard agents, NCI active synthetic compounds and natural extracts, which are present in public available databases. If the data pattern correlates well with that of compounds belonging to a standard agent database (Pearson’s correlation coefficient (PCC > 0.6), the compound of interest may have the same mechanism of action [27,28]. On the other hand, if the activity pattern does not correlate with any standard agent, it is possible that the compound has a novel mechanism of action. Standard COMPARE analyses were per- formed at the GI50 level.
It was established that compounds 4a and 4b demonstrated high correlation levels with rapamycin (NSC S226080) with PCC values of 0.607 and 0.629, respectively. Considerable correlations between compounds 4c, 5a, 5b, 5c, 6a, 6b, and 6c, and rapamycin were noted with PCC values of 0.523, 0.507, 0.496, 0.53, 0.448, 0.453, and 0.538, respectively. Such similarity in COMPARE results could indicate the resemblance in mechanisms of action with rapa- mycin. Rapamycin is reported to be mTOR inhibitor which is con- sidered to be a key enzyme in regulation of cellular metabolism, growth, and proliferation [29,30].

Enzymatic screening
Compounds 4a and 4b, exhibiting the highest correlation levels with rapamycin (mTOR inhibitor), were selected to explore their biological targets at the molecular level. They were subjected to in vitro enzymatic screening against mTOR and structurally-
related phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-alpha (PI3Ka) to determine
their potential affinity as inhibitors for those enzymes. A literature survey was conducted to search for similar compounds with previ- ously reported mTOR or PI3Ka activities [31]. It was found that our

synthesized compounds have several differences from those pre- ceding studies. They contain a new central core thiazolo[3,2-a] pyrimidin-5-one with aryl group at the 3-position and having a morpholine ring that is essential for mTOR/PI3Ka inhibitory activ- ity. Our compounds attained relative structural similarity with thi-
azolopyrimidinone series of selective PI3Kb inhibitory activity [32]. In addition, the central scaffold is not directly attached to a mor- pholine moiety, but through ethylene bridge. It was reported that
mTOR and PI3Ka inhibitors share common feature which is critical
hydrogen bond to morpholine oxygen. This interaction is estab- lished with the backbone NH of Val2240 in mTOR, in an equivalent position to Val882 in PI3Ka [33]. Furthermore, enzyme docking studies indicated that a single amino acid difference exists between mTOR and PI3K in the vicinity of the hinge binding region.
Modeling indicates that Phe961 of PI3K is too large to comfortably accommodate the 2,6-ethylene-bridged morpholine, causing dis- placement of the morpholine oxygen away from its hydrogen bonding partner, the backbone NH of Val882. However, in mTOR, the smaller amino acid substitution leucine (Phe961Leu) creates a deeper pocket, which accommodates the bridged morpholine
without causing significant displacement relative to the corre- sponding morpholine-containing compounds. This causes increased selectivity for analogues containing 2,6-ethylene- bridged morpholine [34].
In addition, it was reported that PI3Ka inhibition will interfere
with glucose homeostasis [35]. It was envisioned that compounds 4a and 4b having morpholine ring extending from the fused hete- rocyclic system will accomplish a selective inhibitor of mTOR that
could display less side effects compared to a dual mTOR/PI3Ka
inhibitor. Moreover, on literature survey, similar framework to our compounds was also observed in 3,4-dihydropyrazino[2,3-b] pyrazin-2(1H)-ones having ethyl bridge to tetrahydro-2H-pyran. They exhibited excellent mTOR potency and maintain selectivity
over the related PI3Ka lipid kinase [36]. We wanted to extend
our work to discover other scaffolds and report herein our findings with mTOR/PI3Ka inhibitory activity. In addition, those com- pounds showed compliance to Lipinski’s rule of five and might have good oral bioavailability. Encouraged by those promising findings, kinase assays were performed at Reaction Biology Corpo- ration at a single dose concentration of 100 lM over mTOR/PI3Ka



to evaluate the kinase inhibitory activity of the synthesized mor pholinoethyl-thiazolopyrimidinone. Regarding activity against mTOR, compounds 4a and 4b displayed low inhibitory activity at
testing concentration of 100 lm. Meanwhile, they exhibited mod-
erate activity against PI3Ka with IC50 values of 120 and 151 lm, respectively. Table 2 shows % inhibition and IC50 values of kinase activity as to the known dual mTOR/PI3Ka kinase inhibitor, PI- 103, as a positive control.
We tried to investigate the possible causes for the decrease in the activity of screened compounds. A possible cause of the decrease in inhibitory activity of the screened compounds may be due to the non-coplanarity. Compounds 4a and 4b were energy minimized using MMFF94x and after that aligned using MOE.2009.10 [37]. It was found that a morpholine moiety, attached to thiazolopyrimidinone ring system through two carbon spacer, is not co-planar with the central core, Fig. 1. Previous case was reported with the same enzymes and was responsible for the decrease in activity. It was found that the inclusion of the tetrahy- dropyranyl scaffold instead of dihydropyranyl into pyrazolopyrim- idine derivatives was associated with a great decrease in both mTOR and PI3K potency. This decline in activity was explained by the differing minimum energy conformation of these two cycles. The dihydropyran (DHP) ring was found to be co-planar with the pyrazolopyrimidine core, whereas the tetrahydropyran
(THP) ring is rotated about 90° out-of-plane with the core [38].


Conclusion

On the basis of results obtained, it was found that the synthe- sized compounds showed observed activity against Renal UO-31 cancer cell line with cell growth inhibition 36 to 48% at a dose of 10 lM. Compounds 4a and 4b displayed moderate activity against
PI3Ka with IC50 values of 120 and 151 mM, respectively. Taking into
account the in vitro anticancer evaluation and kinase assay, com- pounds 4a and 4b could be considered as promising leading skele- ton for further development of more potent PI3ka inhibitors.
