In this paper, multidimensional chaos systems called a trilinear chaotic system for encryption the color image is used. Combining the multi-dimensional chaotic system with encryption algorithms improves
the security. The trilinear system is built from logistic and cubic maps and generates six completely ran- dom bijections T1(x); T2(x); T2(y); T3(x); T3(y); and T3(z). The map T1(x) randomly shuffles the image pix- els, the two maps T2(x) and T2(y) scramble the position of the pixels, and the other three maps change the pixel values. The correlations among the three components of RGB components are reduced, and the
security of the algorithm increases. The simulation results demonstrated that the procedure has very large key spaces and a high level of security.

Introduction

A variety picture consists of many lines and segments of pixels; these pixels have specific values that address the level of the vari- ety in the picture. As a result, the color image is represented as a three numerical matrix for each small area to define the color. Image security is a crucial issue because sensitive images can invite attacks from different places. The transformation of a plain image into a different cipher image is the goal of image encryption. Due to its sensitivity to initial parameters, high security and totally ran- dom performance, chaos theory is used in image encryption. Mat- thews created the first chaotic system in 1989 [1]. Numerous scientific algorithms have defined image encryption with a few secret parameters based on one- or two-dimensional chaotic sys- tems. This work conquers the past works by offering a totally irreg- ular multi-layered framework with different mystery boundaries. The presented chaotic system simultaneously encrypts RGB image and their components. The proposed chaos system consists of six
maps T1(x); T2(x); T2(y); T3(x); ; T3(y); and T3(z) to increase conju-
gation of the items x3; x2, y2, xiy , y3; z2xi; ··· z3 and expand the secu-
T1(x); T2(x); and T2(y) to create three M × N matrix keys (Mr, Mb; Mg ), and it inputs the other three maps T3(x); ; T3(y); and T3(z) to output three vector keys (Vr; Vb; Vg ) of length MN. Utilizing vector
keys, the rows and columns of images are shuffled and scrambled. While the remainder keys are applied many times to growth the difficulty and the security of the system. The first matrix Mr is per- formed to shuffle the block of the image and the remainder matrix
Mb; Mg scramble the location in rows and columns, respectively.
Finally, in order to increase the system’s complexity and security, the three vector keys (Vr; Vb; Vg ) are utilized to twice alter the val- ues of the matrix.

Related works

Over the past few decades, chaos-theoretic encryption algo- rithms have emerged as a powerful strategy for increasing security. By far most picture encryption calculations have been presented in view of ID &2D dimensional chaotic maps. Zhang et al. in 2005 [3] presented an algorithm for encrypting the given image that was depend on a chaotic map and a large encryption key by using a pixel shambling process applied an induced chaotic permutation matrix. Chong et al. [4] use Lorenz of a 3D chaotic system to improve image cryptography’s performance and security. Xiang- dong et al. in 2008 [5] introduced a tumultuous rearranging calcu- lation utilizing an arranging change of a turbulent grouping to get address codes for picture interpretation. The disadvantages of image scrambling methods, such as increasing complexity and requiring knowledge of probability distributions, were avoided by their algorithm [8]. Juan et al. used a discrete chaotic method a safety key produced from the logistic system’s initial conditions and parameters [7]. A Lorenz and Rosslere chaotic system was used
shuffling. Color images have received a lot of attention because they are full of information. The density of RGB components in the color image is determined by the numerical values of RGB com- ponents found in each pixel [14]. There have been numerous descriptions of encryption algorithms [6,11,15,16,18,23,27]. Because they disregard the correlations that exist among color components, these algorithms are more susceptible to attack. Utilizing 2D Hénon-Sine map to generate a pixel permutation, Wu et al. [24] suggested an algorithm based on pixel diffusion and a DNA approach in 2018. Wu et al. [25] encrypted an asym- metric multi-image using compressed sensing and a nonlinear operation in the cylindrical diffraction domain. In 2020, Yasser, et al. [27], produced approach to encrypt images that shuffles pix- els and performs substitution operations with a chaotic system and DWT. El Shafai et al. [28] introduced a DNA encoding method for medical images based on a piecewise linear chaotic system.

Proposed chaos system

Fig. 1 shows the geometric visualisation of the trilinear interpo-
lation chaotic system, the resulting function f at a given point (x; y; z) is equal to the sum of the multiplication of points at each corner subject to coefficient values of cijk and the inside volume is
equal to the partial volume diagonally opposite to the corner. The trilinear chaotic system contains 1D; 2D; and3D equations resulting from log map and cubic maps. The proposed approach increases the quadratic and cubic coupling of the items y2; x2; xiy ; x3; z3 and provided more security to the system. The overall of the proposed system is simply:

image crypto-system based on two maps was presented in 2011 by Keshari and Modani [12]; a chaotic map lattice to alter pixel val- ues by rearranging the pixel’s position and iterating the chaotic map under specific primary conditions. Using a skew tent chaotic system, Zhang, Liu, and others [10] presented a new image encryp- tion algorithm in the same year. They shuffle the order in which all of the image’s pixels are positioned during their work. Permutation-diffusion architecture served as the foundation for their algorithm. Another approach based on Chebyshev and 3D Logistic maps to encrypt a color image was presented in 2012 by Khade and Narnaware [15]. The proposed turbulent guides subbed the RGB parts, produced a key, and mixed the picture pixels. The pre-owned procedure relying upon a strategic guide used to por- tray a dark scale picture. All matrix value is swapped according to sequences from chaotic series using a digital matrix approach, enabling simultaneous pixel replacement and mixing. Wang et al. (2012) [16] proposed another calculation utilizing a three- layered framework of the variety picture and a two-layered Lorenz and tent tumultuous framework simultaneously to encode RGB parts. Their calculation has four stages. In the first place, the three-layered grid is changed over completely to a two-layered network and the low-recurrence wavelet coefficient is separated
Six chaotic equations (2) will be derivative from Eq. (1) within the range (0, 1). The control parameters cijk outside the range have no chaotic behavior.
The proposed system (2) comprises of 1D; 2D; and3D equations derivative from (1).
Fig. 2 demonstrates that in the area (0,1), the 1D&2D systems go to a chaotic state and produce a chaotic sequence that is subject to:
73< l; l1 <12.87, 2.71< l2 <3.58, 0.039 <c1; c2 <0.251. Fig. 3
displays that, the 3D system go into a chaotic form in the area (0,1) subject to: 3.47 < k <3.84 and 0.038 < b; a <0.041. The bifur- cation diagram of 1D; 2D; and3D are presented in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 respectively.

and then converted to (Mr, Mb, Mg ), and the chaotic maps T3(x),

Image Encryption Algorithm (IEA)

IEA algorithm involves three phases as follows:
IEA : PlainImage(P)→ CipherImageP5
Phase 1:
Along with the alteration of pixels’ values, we describe a secure block shuffling tool. The first diffusion level, or random change in
RBG pixel values, is the crucial effect of PPT in this process: The
Where q ≥ 3MN, merge the matrices R'(r), B'(r), and G' (r) horizontally to obtain the M × 3N matrix P1, and produce a sequence of 3MN numbers Y 1 = y1, ..., y3NM from P1. Permute the row Y1 = y1, ..., y3NM by the vector key Vx. We obtain the scramble vector Y' = y'1, ..., y'3NM . Reshape the vector Y ' into three M × N matrices; Ry(r), By(r) and Gy(r).
Phase 3:
Pnow is the current plain pixel value, Dpre is the previous cipher pixel value following the current diffusion, and Ppre is the previous
plain value. Dnow is the current ciphered pixel value following the current diffusion. Their underlying qualities in Rz(r), Bz(r), and Gz(r) are equivalent to nothing. Monitor columns in P3 to set three vectors V (Rz(r)), V (Bz(r)), and V (Gz(r)) each with length MN.
Utilizing the vector product with the key vector Vz, we apply the third level of pixel diffusion to these vectors in the following manner:
8> Zzr = V (Rz(r)) × Vg mod256


RBG’s random pixel values, or first diffusion level, are as follows:
< Zzb = V (Bz(r)) × Vg mod256
(6)


Rr	M R M T mod 256
>: Zzg = V (Gz(r)) × Vg mod256

Zzb, and Zzg while [:] refers to a random value.

The steps of the encryption system with the actuated 6 keys are displayed in Fig. 7. Fig. 8 depicts the decryption steps and the six keys. Similar to the image encryption pseudocode, the image decryption algorithm (IDA) works in the opposite way.
Step 1: using all random number in IDA.
Step 2: Apply 4th level of random by using the following equations:

Step 6: To get rid of the effect of randomly switching the col- umns and rows, return to the reverse paths.
Step 7: The following is an inverted first random diffusion:

The average time to consume is<4.01 ms. Our running opportunity is near the running time in [2].


Experimental results

Anaconda 4.8.3 is used to implement the system. We have cho- sen Python as the programming language for our development. An Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8550U CPU running at 1.80 GHz 2.00 GHz and 8 GB of RAM are used to test the implementation in Windows 10 64-bit OS.

The his- tograms show the correlation among the pixels in the plain images ‘‘baboon” and ‘‘Lena” at each level of color density.
The encrypted two images are depicted in Fig. 11 (a–d) and the histograms of two images are depicted in Fig. 12(a – c). The his- tograms show how the ciphered RGB pixels are consistently corre- lated with the pixels at each level.

Let the input images have size 256×256. The number of itera- tions over six maps I0 is 6 × (3 × M × N) = 6 × (3 × 256 × 256 )≈
220 ≈ 107. The key space spreads to ≈ 1.953 × 107 × 10235 =
1.953 × 10242. the space of key is larger than 2138, 258, 10140 , 2256 [17,26,30]. It is greater than 2448 = 7.8×10134, the highest number of key spaces cited in the study [23]. Within the diagonalization form (2), there are 24 initial values. Our key space increments it
up to 10415. The key space described by the proposed algorithms is large enough to withstand brute-force attacks.

The Sensitivity Examination of the Secret Keys.

Little differences between keys generate another cipher images. The Baboon’s decrypted image with the correct key of k = 3.66 is depicted in Fig. 13. On the other hand, the Baboon image is decrypted in Fig. 14 using an incorrect encryption key equal to k = 3.66000000000000001. The algorithm was made more sensi- tive to the key thanks to this. A little change in the key will bring about a completely unique unscrambling result, and the attacker will not have the option to get to the right plain picture.

Adjacent Pixels Correlation Analysis

The following formula is used to calculate the vertical, horizon- tal, and diagonal correlation between 3000 randomly selected nearby pixels:

E(y) =  1 X (y )	(17)

Horizontal direction (H/D),

Diagonal direction (D/D).

They show a lot of concentration in the plain image and have a tendency of one in two neighboring pixels in the ciphered image. This indicates that the neighboring pixels in the ciphered image are random, and the encryption effects resist statistical attack.

Detection of different Attack

To calculate the capacity, the Pixel Change Rate Number, and the Unified Average Change Intensity (UACI) tests are applied. The UACI test compares the average intensity of two images, while the NPCR test distinguishes between the numbers of distinct pixels in each [13]. UACI and NPCR can calculated as following:

Conclusion

For image security, we recommended a key space algorithm that could withstand brute-force attacks. Three keys are generated by the proposed cryptosystem in the form of a MN-length vector matrix and three keys in the M × N square matrix. Multi-level dif- fusion of pixel values and variety among shuffling and scrambling of rows and columns in the color components of the plain image are the foundations of our cryptosystem for image. The computa- tional comparison of the proposed procedure to other cryptosys- tems revealed that the proposed system has large key spaces and a high level of security. The benefit of the current system is utiliz- ing staggered encryption in view of huge key space.
