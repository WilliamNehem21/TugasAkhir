Abstract
The metric space representation in terms of enriched categories of [14] is extended to quasi-uniform spaces and uniformly continuous maps. The bicompletion of the quasi-uniform spaces [6] is related to the Cauchy-completion. On one hand abstract quasi-uniformities and uniformly continuous maps are defined. They generalize quasi-uniform spaces and their morphisms and form a locally preordered 2-category AQUnif . On the other hand a 2-category Enr(H) of enrichments over different bases is defined. H stands here for a parameter 2-functor with domain a locally filtered 2-category and codomain the 2-category with objects monoidal partial orders and arrows the so- called super monoidal functors. Also the bases considered are partial orders (or “quantales”). In Enr(H) the Cauchy-complete objects defines a fully reflective sub-2-category. Eventually we show a 2-equivalence AQUnif =∼ Enr(H) for a particular H. Thus one gets a completion for abstract quasi-uniformities, that reduces to the bicompletion for quasi-uniformities.
Keywords: enriched categories, quasi uniform spaces


Introduction
In [14] it is shown that enrichments over a particular monoidal closed category, say [0, +∞], may capture the notion of generalized metric spaces (also called pseudo quasi-metrics). The Cauchy-completion of V-enrichments for a general monoidal closed V is defined. It reduces to the metric space completion when V = [0, +∞]. Also a general theory of (co)completions for enrichments is de-

veloped in [9]. It is possible to parameterize the various completions according to classes of chosen colimits.
Since these fundamental works, the notion of completion of enrichments has been successfully applied to various areas of mathematics and computer science. Let us cite as a non-exhaustive lists of applications [23] for sheaves,
[1] for fibrations, [22] for domain theory, [8], [2] for domain theory and metric spaces, also more recently [12] for metric spaces, [15] for ultra-metric spaces. Eventually we refer to [7] for many other mathematical examples of enrich- ments over quantales.
Nevertheless in some cases it seems necessary to develop further the theory of enrichments to render it more applicable. Let us mention for example the work on the change of base bicategories [10], that yielded the two-sided enrichments as bicategory morphisms. The original motivation for the change of base was to encode geometric morphisms using Walters’ representation of sheaves [13].
Extending the original idea from [14], this paper treats quasi-uniformities and uniformly continuous maps. Its aim is to clarify the connection between quasi-uniform spaces together with uniformly continuous maps and enriched categories together with enriched functors. Again it will appear that the change of base techniques are required to capture the notion of uniformly continuous maps.
Quasi-uniformities arise from uniformities, as quasi-pseudo-metrics from pseudo metrics, by dropping the symmetry condition. These spaces were first studied in relation with topological groups (see [11] for a recent survey). They have also become a center of interest for computer science since the pioneer- ing works of Smyth and Sunderhauf [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21]. From a technical point of view, a huge challenge is to define a correct theory of non symmetric space, that is, together with a well defined notion of non symmet- ric convergence. From this perspective, there is a hope that the analogy with enriched categories - which are essentially non-symmetric objects - should be fruitful. In this spirit, the connection established in the present paper enables the transposition of the categorical Cauchy-completion to the topological bi- completion.
Starting with the idea of [14] that enrichments are general metric spaces, and considering quasi-uniform spaces, a few remarks are in order. One may observe the following two points:
The [0, +∞]-functors correspond to non-increasing maps that are less gen- eral than the traditional uniformly continuous maps.
Quasi-uniform spaces are more general than the metric ones and also admit
a completion a` la Cauchy, the so-called bicompletion [6].  After a little


thought, it seems reasonable that a quasi-uniform space (X, U ) occurs as a V-enrichment where the base category V is related to the quasi-uniformity U (indeed this is the case, as shown in this paper). But then it seems unrealistic to code the whole category of quasi-uniform spaces as a category
of enrichments over a single a base category.
Therefore we investigated a theory of enrichments over different bases with in mind that:
(pb1) Such a theory should capture the notion of quasi-uniform spaces with the right morphisms: the uniformly continuous maps;
(pb2) There should exist a Cauchy-completion for enrichments over different bases that should capture the quasi-uniform space bicompletion.
It is fair to cite at this stage the recent work [3] that treated nicely (pb1). Nevertheless it is not obvious (at the moment for the author) that the general framework developed in the later paper may describe naturally the Cauchy completion. On that point our works may actually differ.
To present now an overview of the results obtained, it seems necessary to point out in an informal way the problems occurring with Lawvere’s approach for quasi-uniform spaces. This should also provide some intuition for later technical developments.
Let us recall briefly some results of [14] regarding the (general) metric spaces.
[0, +∞] is the monoidal category with:
objects: positive reals and +∞;
arrows: the reverse ordering, x → y if and only if x ≥ y;
tensor: the addition (with +∞ + x = x + +∞ = +∞);
unit: 0.
[0, +∞] is obviously symmetric. It is also closed as for any pair x, y of objects in [0, +∞], the exponential object [x, y] is max{y − x, 0}.
A simple translation of the categorical definitions shows that [0, +∞]- categories and [0, +∞]-functors correspond respectively to the so-called gen- eral metric spaces and the non-increasing maps.
A general metric space or gms consists in a set of objects or elements denoted Obj(A) or sometimes just A, together with a map A(−, −) : Obj(A)× Obj(A) → [0, +∞] that satisfies:
for all x, y, z ∈ A, A(y, z)+ A(x, y) ≥ A(x, z);
for all x ∈ A, A(x, x) = 0.


For two gms a map F : A → B is non-increasing when (∗) for all x, y ∈ A, A(x, y) ≥ B(F (x),F (y)).
Considering [0, +∞]-natural transformations one obtains then a preorder on non-increasing maps by F ⇒ G : A → B if and only if for all x ∈ A, B(F (x), G(x)) = 0. This preorder makes the category of general metric spaces
and non-increasing maps, a locally preordered 2-category. Actually the sets of non-increasing maps between two general metric spaces inherits the structure of a general metric space.

[0, +∞]-modules have a simple form. A [0, +∞]-module M : A ◦ B is a map B × A → [0, +∞] such that:
for all x, x' ∈ A and y ∈ B, A(x, x')+ M (y, x) ≥ M (y, x');
for all x ∈ A and y, y' ∈ B, M (y, x)+ B(y', y) ≥ M (y', x).

They compose as follows. Given A  M◦
 B  N◦
 C , the composite N ∗ M is

defined for any a ∈ A and c ∈ C by N ∗ M (c, a) =	b∈B M (b, a)+ N (c, b).
One has a 2-category [0, +∞]-Mod of [0, +∞]-modules and thus a formal
notion of adjoints in this 2-category. It was observed in [14] that minimal Cauchy filters on a g.m.s. A are in one-to-one correspondence with left ad-
joint modules of the form 1  M◦ A . This is crucial to establish that the full
subcategory of [Aop, [0, +∞]] of left adjoint modules is, in term of general metric spaces, the Cauchy-completion of A.
Of course one would like to adopt this categorical framework to treat quasi- uniform spaces and their bicompletions. Nevertheless there are a number of technical problems that we shall enumerate now.
The first point is to describe quasi-uniform spaces as enrichments. Accord- ing to the coding below for metric spaces, our intuition would tell us that a quasi-uniform space (X, U ) defines an enrichment with objects the x, y... ∈ X and homs given by:
(∗∗) X(x, y) = {u ∈ U | (x, y) ∈ u}.
Actually this is almost true but using this straightforward approach, one fails to define a monoidal category!
The second point is that there could not be one fixed base category for all quasi-uniform spaces. As one may suppose, there is description of the space (X, U ) as a V-category in the spirit of (∗∗) above. But here the base V would
clearly depend from the quasi-uniformity U . Therefore one needs to consider
different bases to code quasi-uniform spaces as enrichments.
A third point is to get a categorical characterization of the quasi-uniform


maps.  Until now one only knows such one for non-increasing maps.  Let us consider quasi-uniform spaces (X, U ) and (Y, T ). Any map f : X → Y defines a relation R ⊆ U × T by R(u, t) if and only if for all x, y ∈ X, (x, y) ∈ u ⇒ (f (x),f (y)) ∈ t. Then one has
∃R(X(x, y)) ⊆ Y (f x, fy),  for all x, y ∈ X,
where ∃R denotes the direct image of R. Note that the f above is uniformly continuous exactly when for all t ∈ T , there exists u ∈ U such that for all x, y, (x, y) ∈ u ⇒ (f (x),f (y)) ∈ t that is just when
∃R(U ) = T.
The inequality (1) may be seen as a generalization of the condition (∗) defining non-increasing maps. The idea is then to characterize the uniformly continu- ous maps f between (X, U ) and (Y, T ) as the ones with an adequate change of base — i.e. some R ⊆ U × T satisfying (1) — and such that this change of base satisfies moreover (2).
So far we have only defined the changes of base in terms of uniformities. Actually we shall show that they may be defined from particular monoidal functors, the so-called super ones. Then finally, uniformly continuous maps
(X, U ) → (Y, T ) are maps f : X → Y defining a VT -functor F@(X) → Y where F : VU → VT is a suitable monoidal functor with induced change of base F@.
An unpleasant feature of this coding is that the bases depend from the set of objects of the enrichments. To get rid of this, we generalize slightly the quasi-uniform spaces by considering pairs (X, U ) where U is no more a filter of binary relations on X but more generally a semi group with a lattice
structure. This with a bunch of axioms defines our abstract quasi-uniformities.
We introduce also the notion of canonical abstract quasi-uniformities. They are needed to make the eventual link between abstract quasi-uniformities and enrichments. Canonical quasi-uniformities are exactly enrichments: monoidal structures may be derived from them so that the above condition (∗∗) holds. It happens also that any abstract quasi-uniformity is equivalent to a canonical one (in a 2-categorical sense!).
The last difficulty was to find the good change of base functors, i.e. they should induce the morphisms of a 2-category of enrichments over different bases that admits a Cauchy-completion. Their definition was found by a care- ful inspection of the changes of base induced by quasi-uniformly continuous maps.
To sum up our results we have established the following chain of corre-


spondences.
Enr(H) ~(1) CAQUnif ~(2) AQU nif ~(3) QU nif.
Enr(H) is a 2-category of enrichments over different bases. Bases consid- ered are just partial orders or “quantales”. CAQunif , AQU inf , QU nif denote respectively the 2-categories of canonical abstract quasi-uniformities,
abstract quasi-uniformities and quasi-uniformities. (1) is an isomorphism of 2-categories, (2) is an equivalence of 2-categories and (3) is a 2-coreflection. The 2-categorical Cauchy-completion in Enr(H) migrates through (1) and
(2) to AQU nif . We have also explicited this completion for abstract quasi-
uniformities. From the latter and (3) one may retrieve the bicompletion for quasi-uniformities.
The rest of paper is technical and presents the above results. It is is organized as follows. There are two sides, one being enriched category theory, the other one topology, and the purpose is to reunify them. We start from enriched categories and do half of the way. Then start again from the quasi- uniformities and do the other half. The (canonical) abstract quasi-uniformities stand at the meeting point.
Section 2 recalls basic elements of quasi-uniformity theory. We introduce quasi-uniformities and their morphisms - that we call for short uniformly con- tinuous maps. We point out that the set of uniformly continuous maps between two given quasi-uniformities may be preordered and hence quasi-uniformities and their morphisms form a locally preordered 2-category QU nif . Cauchy filters and the notions of separation and completeness for quasi-uniformities
are recalled as well as the existence of a bicompletion for quasi-uniformities.
Chapter 3 recalls well-known very basic facts of the theory of V-categories in the particular case where V is a monoidal partial order. The Cauchy- completion for V-enrichments is detailed. The purpose of this chapter is to make the theory of the Cauchy completion accessible to non-specialists. The drawback is that fundamental notions of enriched category theory that are tight to the Cauchy-completion (functor categories, Yoneda, accessibility, free- cocompletions...) are just omitted. For any of these notions, we refer to Kelly’s book [9]. The case of V-enrichments with V non symmetric is treated in [4].
In chapter 4, we define a 2-category of enrichments over different bases. Here again, we only consider the case where the base monoidal categories are partial orders. We introduce the super monoidal functors between monoidal biclosed complete partial orders. They serve to define the 2-category Enr(H),
where H is a parameter 2-functor from a locally filtered 2-category to the 2-
category SMon of monoidal biclosed complete partial orders, super monoidal functors and monoidal transformations between them.  For this 2-category


the definition of morphisms between enrichments over different bases involves a change base monoidal functor that is super. We show that the Cauchy completion of enrichments is really a completion in Enr(H). Precisely the Cauchy-completion yields a left 2-adjoint to the inclusion 2-functor SC −
Enr(H) → Enr(H) where SC − Enr(H) denotes the 2-category with skeletal
and Cauchy-complete objects and with arrows and local preorders inherited respectively from Enr(H). An important point is that SC − Enr(H) is a full replete subcategory of Enr(H).
Section 5 introduces the locally partially ordered 2-category QU T of quasi- uniform triples and their morphisms. Quasi-uniform triples correspond to an axiomatization of the lattice of quasi-uniformities and may be seen as quasi-uniformities “without points”. We show how to build monoidal biclosed
categories from quasi-uniform triples and super monoidal functors from mor- phisms of quasi-uniform triples. The notion of canonical morphisms of quasi- uniform triple is defined. It is needed to show the existence of a 2-functor QU T → SMon. Indeed this 2-functor factorizes through CQUT that is the locally partially ordered 2-category of quasi-uniform triples and canonical mor- phisms.
Section 6 introduces the locally preordered 2-category AQU nif of abstract quasi-uniformities and their morphisms. As mentioned below abstract quasi- uniformities lie in between quasi-uniformities and enrichments - this state-
ment will be made precise! - An abstract quasi-uniformity consists in a set of points with a “general distance” valued in a quasi-uniform triple. Any quasi-uniformity defines in a natural way an abstract one, (but the nature of this correspondence is postponed to section 8).  We show that the 2-
category AQU nif is 2-equivalent to the 2-category CAQUnif of canonical
abstract quasi-uniformities, that is 2-isomorphic to Enr(H) for the 2-functor H : CQUT → SMon defined in section 5. Let us just underline here that the notion of canonical abstract quasi-uniformities is linked with the crucial axiom
∀u ∈ U, ∃v ∈ U, v2 ⊆ u
occurring in the definition of a quasi-uniformity U .
Section 7 concerns the completion of abstract quasi-uniformities. We in- troduce the notions of Cauchy filters, neighborhood filters, separation and completeness for abstract quasi-uniformities.  They correspond to the usual
notions for quasi-uniformities.  Via the 2-equivalence AQU nif ∼= Enr(H),
sending the quasi-uniformity A to the corresponding enrichment C(A), we see that:
minimal Cauchy filters on A are in bijective correspondence with left adjoint modules of the form 1	◦ C (A), 


the separation of A is equivalent to the skeletality of C(A),
the completeness of A is equivalent to the Cauchy-completeness of C(A).

Since AQU nif
=∼ Enr(H), one obtains as a direct application of the results

of the section 4, a completion for abstract quasi-uniformities. Precisely, if SC − AQU nif denotes the 2-category with objects the separated and com- plete abstract quasi-uniformities and arrows and local preorders inherited from AQU nif then the inclusion 2-functor SC − AQunif → AQU nif has a left 2- adjoint that sends any abstract quasi-uniformity to its completion. Eventually we give an internal description of the completion of a quasi-uniformity.
Section 8 relates eventually usual quasi-uniformities to abstract ones. There is an obvious inclusion 2-functor P : QU nif → AQU nif that admits a right 2-adjoint Q such that P ◦ Q = 1. Defining concrete abstract uniformities we show that QU nif is 2-equivalent to the 2-category with objects the con- crete abstract quasi-uniformities and arrows and local preorders inherited from
AQU nif . Then we show how to retrieve the bicompletion of quasi-uniformities from the completion of abstract quasi-uniformities.

Quasi-uniformities
In this section we will recall briefly some elements of the theory of quasi- uniformities.
A quasi-uniformity U on a set X, also denoted (X, U ), is a set of binary relations U ⊆ ℘(X × X) that satisfies:
∀u ∈ U, ∆ ⊆ u (∆ is the diagonal relation),
U is a filter on X × X,
∀u ∈ U, ∃v ∈ U, v2 ⊆ u.
A quasi-uniformity basis on X, is a filter basis for a quasi-uniformity (X, U ).
Given quasi-uniformities (X, U ) and (Y, V ), a map f : X → Y is uniformly continuous when
∀v ∈ V, ∃u ∈ U, ∀x, y ∈ X, (x, y) ∈ u ⇒ (f x, fy) ∈ v.
The set of uniformly continuous maps from (X, U ) to (Y, V ) is preordered by
⇒ given for all f, g : (X, U ) → (Y, V ), by f ⇒ g if and only if ∀v ∈ V, ∀x ∈ X, (f (x), g(x)) ∈ v. Quasi-uniformities, uniformly continuous maps and their preorders form a locally preordered 2-category QU nif .
Let (X, U ) be a quasi-uniformity. A filter F on X is Cauchy (w.r.t U ) when it satisfies:
∀u ∈ U, ∃f ∈ F, f × f ⊆ u.


The neighborhood filter of some x ∈ X is the filter with basis the set of subsets of the form {y/(x, y) ∈ u ∩ u−1}, u ranging in U . Such a filter as above is Cauchy, it is also a minimal Cauchy one (This fact may be retrieved from results in subsections 7.2 and 8.2). (X, U ) is said complete when any minimal Cauchy filter occurs as the neighborhood filter of some element of X. (X, U ) is separated when the map sending the elements of X to their neighborhood filters is injective. Again we shall see in a slightly more general framework (7.10) that (X, U ) is separated if and only if

∀x, y ∈ X, x /= y ⇒ ∃u ∈ U, (x, y) /∈ u ∩ u−1.
We let SC − QU nif denote the locally preordered 2-category with ob- jects the separated and complete quasi-uniformities and with arrows and local preorders inherited from QU nif .
In section 8, we are going to show that the theorem below [6], may be ob- tained as a consequence of general results regarding enriched category theory
4.7 and 4.11.
Theorem 2.1 The inclusion 2-functor SC − QU nif → QU nif has a left 2-adjoint.

Enrichments over monoidal partial orders
This chapter recalls a few very basic elements of enriched category theory. All the results presented are well-known or belong to folklore. They are re- produced for completeness and to fix notations. This chapter introduces the Cauchy-completion of categories enriched over monoidal closed partial orders. Quite surprisingly this notion is accessible without referring to deep results in enriched category theory (Yoneda, indexed colimits, free cocompletions). We refer the reader to [9] for a general presentation of enriched category theory.
We call a monoidal category that is also a partial order, a monoidal partial order. In this section we will consider a monoidal biclosed and complete partial order V, its tensor product is denoted ⊗, its identity I. An important fact is that V being complete is also cocomplete.
Definition 3.1 [V-enrichments] An enrichment A over V or a V-category is a set Obj(A) — the objects of A — with a mapping A(−, −) : Obj(A) × Obj(A) −→ Obj(V) satisfying:
for any object a of A, I ≤ A(a, a);
for any objects a, b, c of A, A(b, c) ⊗ A(a, b) ≤ A(a, c).


Given V-categories A and B, a V-functor f from A to B is a map f : Obj(A) −→ Obj(B) such that for any objects a, a' of A, A(a, a') ≤ B(f a, fa'). Given two V-functors f, g : A → B there is a V-natural transformation from f to g, — which is denoted f ⇒ g, when for any object a of A, I ≤
B(f a, ga).
The usual definition of enrichment does not require Obj(A) above to be a set. In this paper, we shall consider only “small” enrichments i.e. such that their sets of objects is small. The base categories will be also always small. This makes sense since the examples of enrichments that we will look at, are very “concrete”, and the fact that Cauchy-completion (3.10) preserves the smallness of objects is essential.
Proposition 3.2 V-categories, V-functors and, V-natural transformations con- stitute a locally preordered 2-category V − Cat.
In V − Cat the (horizontal) composition of V-functors is given by the com- position of underlying maps, and the identity functors correspond to identity maps. ˆ1 denotes the enrichment on V, with one object, say ∗, and ˆ1(∗, ∗) = I. If B is a V-category, for any of its object b, b : ˆ1 → B denotes the V-functor sending ∗ to b.

Definition 3.3 [V-modules] Given two V-categories A and B, a V-module ϕ from A to B — denoted ϕ : A ○ B — is a map ϕ : Obj(B) × Obj(A) → Obj(V) such that:
for any objects a, a' of A, and b of B, A(a, a') ⊗ ϕ(b, a) ≤ ϕ(b, a');
for any objects a of A and, b, b' of B, ϕ(b, a) ⊗ B(b', b) ≤ ϕ(b', a).
For any two V-modules ϕ : A ○ B and ψ : B ○ C , their composite ψ • ϕ : A ○ C is defined by: ∀a ∈ Obj(A),c ∈ Obj(C), (ψ • ϕ)(c, a) = b∈Obj(B)ϕ(b, a) ⊗ ψ(c, b). The set V − Mod(A, B) of V-modules from A to B
is partially ordered by: ϕ ≤ ϕ' ⇔ ∀(b, a) ∈ Obj(B)×Obj(A), ϕ(b, a) ≤ ϕ'(b, a).
Proposition 3.4 V-categories and V-modules with partial orders deﬁned above, constitute a locally partially ordered 2-category denoted V − Mod.
In V−Mod, the identity in A is the module with underlying map A(−, −) : Obj(A) × Obj(A) → Obj(V) sending any (a, a') to A(a, a').	For any V- categories A and B, a V-module ϕ : A ○ B has right adjoint ψ : B ○ A if and only if A(−, −) ≤ ψ•ϕ and ϕ•ψ ≤ B(−, −). For any left adjoint module ϕ, ϕ˜ will denote its (unique!) right adjoint. Any V-functor f : A → B corre- sponds to a pair of adjoint modules fo E f o, fo : A ○ B , f o : B ○ A ,


as follows:  for any objects a of A, and b of B, fo(b, a) = B(b, fa) and
f o(a, b) = B(f a, b).
Further on V − AM od will denote the locally partially ordered 2-category with objects V-categories, arrows: left adjoint V-modules and local partial orders inherited from V − Mod.
Proposition 3.5 There is a 2-functor JV : V − Cat → V − Mod as follows. It is the identity on objects, and is the map (−)o on arrows sending any V- functor f to the V-module fo. For any V-functors f, g : A → B, f ⇒ g if and only if fo ≤ go.
Definition 3.6 [Skeletality, Cauchy-completeness] A V-category B is skeletal, respectively Cauchy-complete when for any V-category A, the map (−)o : V − Cat(A, B) → V − AM od(A, B) is injective, respectively surjective.
Remark 3.7 For any V-category B, the following assertions are equivalent:
B is skeletal;
The map (−)o : V − Cat(ˆ1, B) → V − AM od(ˆ1, B) is injective;
For any of its objects a and b, if I ≤ B(a, b) and I ≤ B(b, a) then a = b.
Proposition 3.8 A V-category B is Cauchy-complete when the map (−)o : V − Cat(ˆ1, B) → V − AM od(ˆ1, B) is surjective. (i.e. for any left adjoint V-module ϕ : ˆ1 ○ B , ϕ = bo for some object b of B).
We define the following 2-categories.
V−SkCcCat : with objects skeletal and Cauchy-complete V-categories, and arrows and local preorders inherited from V − Cat.
V − SkCcAMod : with objects: skeletal and Cauchy-complete V-categories, and arrows and local partial orders inherited from V − AM od.
Proposition 3.9 The restriction of JV on V − SkCcCat is a 2-isomorphism onto V − SkCcAMod.
Definition 3.10 [Cauchy-completion] Let A be a V-category. The Cauchy- completion of A is the V-category A¯ defined as follows. Its objects are the left-adjoint V-modules of the form ϕ : ˆ1 ○ A . For convenience we will consider modules in Obj(A¯) as well as their adjoints, as maps with domains
A. For any ϕ, ψ ∈ Obj(A¯), A¯(ϕ, ψ) = (ϕ˜ • ψ)(∗, ∗) =	a∈Obj(A) ψ(a) ⊗ ϕ˜(a).
The map Obj(A) → Obj(A¯) sending any a to the V-module ao, defines a
V-functor jA : A → A¯.
Proposition 3.11 For any V-category A, A¯ is skeletal and Cauchy-complete.



Lemma 3.12 For any V-category A, (jA) : A ○ A¯ and (jA)o : A¯
are inverse modules.
 A 

With 3.9, 3.12 and 3.11, one may establish straightforwardly 3.13 and 3.14 below.
Proposition 3.13 There is an equivalence of 2-categories S : V − AM od ∼= V − SkCcCat, deﬁned on objects by S(A) = A¯ and on arrows by S(ϕ) = fϕ where for any left adjoint V-module ϕ : A ○ B , fϕ : A¯ → B¯ is the unique V-functor f satisfying fo • jAo = jBo • ϕ.
Proposition 3.14 The inclusion 2-functor V − SkCcCat → V − Cat has a left 2-adjoint.
Here, the left 2-adjoint of the inclusion sends a V-category A to A¯ and the unit takes value jA : A → A¯ in A.
According to 3.11 and 3.12, the following is coherent
Definition 3.15 [Morita-equivalence] Two V-categories A and B are Morita- equivalent when one the following equivalent assertions is satisfied:
They are isomorphic in V − Mod;
Their Cauchy-completions are isomorphic in V − Cat.


More on enrichments
In this chapter (4.1 and 4.2) we shall develop a 2-category of enrichments over different bases that will allow us to code quasi uniform spaces and their mor- phisms. As in the previous section we only treat enrichments over monoidal closed complete partial orders. We shall omit to recall the peculiar nature of the base monoidal categories.

About the change of base
The change of base for enrichments (over bicategories) has recently known some new developments [10]. Nevertheless we shall only use an old formulation of a classical result [5]. We introduce in this subsection the so-called super
functors that were defined in [13]. These results will serve in the next section 4.2.
Proposition 4.1 There is a 2-functor (−)@ : Mon → 2 − CAT between the following 2-categories.
Mon is the locally partially ordered 2-category with:

objects: small monoidal biclosed and complete partial orders,
arrows: monoidal functors,
2-cells: natural transformations (here, monoidal transformations are just natural transformations and there is a 2-cell F ≤ G : V → W in Mon when for any object v ∈ V, Fv ≤ Gv in W).
2−CAT is the 2-category of large 2-categories, 2-functors and 2-natural trans- formations.
(−)@ sends any category V to the 2-category V − Cat. For any functor F : V → W, F@ : V − Cat → W − Cat, is as follows. For any V-category A, F@A is the W-category with the same objects as A and such that for any objects a, b of A, F@A(a, b) = F A(a, b). For any V-functor f : A → B, F@f : F@A → F@B is the W-functor with the same underlying map as f. For any monoidal transformation F ≤ G, there is a 2-natural transformation with value in A the W-functor F@A → G@A, with underlying map the identity of Obj(A).
Proposition 4.2 If F : V → W lies in Mon then there is a lax normal 3 functor F : V− Mod → W − Mod that extends F@, i.e. such that the diagram below commutes:
V − Cat   F@  W − Cat

For any V-module ϕ : A ○ B , F (ϕ) : F@A ○ F@ B is the map

⎧⎨ Obj(B) × Obj(A) → Obj(V),
⎩ ∀a ∈ Obj(A),b ∈ Obj(B), F (ϕ)(b, a) = Fϕ(b, a).
Proof. Let ϕ : A ○ B . For any objects a, a' of A and b of B,
F@A(a, a') ⊗ F (ϕ)(b, a) = F A(a, a') ⊗ Fϕ(b, a)
≤ F (A(a, a') ⊗ ϕ(b, a))
≤ F (ϕ(b, a'))
= F (ϕ)(b, a').
Similarly, for any object a of A and b, b' of B, Fϕ(b, a)⊗FB(b', b) ≤ Fϕ(b', a). Thus F (ϕ) is a well defined module F@A ○ F@ B in W − Mod.
Trivially if ϕ ≤ ψ : A ○ B then F ϕ ≤ F ψ : F@A ○ F@ B .
Now given ϕ : A ○ B and ψ : B ○ C , for any objects a of A and c

By definition F (fo) = (F@f )o for any V-functor f , thus for any V-category
A, F (1Ao) = (F@1A)o = (1F@A)o.	 
Lemma 4.3 Let F : V → W lie in Mon and f : A → B be a V − functor. Then:
F (fo) E F (f o) in W − Mod;
If fo is an isomorphism in V − Mod then F (f o) • F (fo) = 1.
Proof. (i): Results from the facts that for any V-functor f , F (fo) = (F@(f ))o
o
and also F (f o) = (F@(f )) .
(ii): Suppose fo • f o = 1 and f o • fo = 1. Composing the second inequality by F which is lax and normal, one gets F (f o) • F (fo) ≤ F (f o • fo) = F (1)
= 1. Thus F (f o) • F (fo) = 1 since F (fo) E F (f o).	 
Definition 4.4 A monoidal functor F : V → W is super when for any family of pairs of o bjects (vi, wi) ∈ Obj(V)×Obj(V), i ranging in I, if IV ≤	i∈I vi⊗wi
Note that the composition of super functors and the identity functors are super so we may define SMon as the 2-category with objects the monoidal biclosed complete partial orders, with arrows the super monoidal functors and, with 2-cells inherited from Mon.
Lemma 4.5 If F is super then F : V − Mod → W − Mod preserves adjoint pairs: if ϕ E ϕ˜ in V − Mod then F (ϕ) E F (ϕ˜) in W − Mod.
Proof. Suppose that the monoidal F : V → W is super. Consider a left adjoint ϕ : A ○ B in V − Mod.
Let us see that 1 ≤ F ϕ˜• F ϕ. Since 1 ≤ ϕ˜• ϕ, for any object a of A, IV ≤ A(a, a) ≤ b∈Obj(B)(ϕ(b, a) ⊗ ϕ˜(a, b)) thus IУ ≤ b∈Obj(B) Fϕ(b, a) ⊗ F ϕ˜(a, b). Thus for any objects a, a' of A,
F A(a, a') ≤ F A(a, a') ⊗ (     Fϕ(b, a) ⊗ F ϕ˜(a, b))
=	b∈Obj(B)((F A(a, a ) ⊗ Fϕ(b, a)) ⊗ F ϕ˜(a, b))
≤	b∈Obj(B)(Fϕ(b, a ) ⊗ F ϕ˜(a, b))
= (F ϕ˜ • F ϕ)(a, a').



That F ϕ • F ϕ˜ ϕ • ϕ˜ ≤ 1:
≤ 1 results from the facts that F  is lax and normal and

F (ϕ) • F (ϕ˜) ≤ F (ϕ • ϕ˜) ≤ F (1) = 1.	 
Note that if F : V − Mod → W is super then according to the previous lemma F : V − Mod → W − Mod will preserve in particular isomorphic modules, thus the Morita equivalence and the Cauchy-completion.

Enrichments over different bases
We investigate a kind of 2-categories with objects enrichments over differ- ent bases.  These 2-categories are the Enr(H) where H : F → SMon is a parameter 2-functor with domain F locally filtered. The definition of the morphisms of Enr(H) involves the super monoidal functors defined previ- ously.  It happens that for a particular H, Enr(H) is 2-equivalent to the 2-category of abstract quasi-uniformities (see 6 further). Eventually we show
that the Cauchy-completion yields again a left 2-adjoint to the inclusion SC − Enr(H) → Enr(H), where SC − Enr(H) denotes the 2-category with objects the skeletal and Cauchy-complete enrichments and arrows and 2-cells inherited from Enr(H). We introduce first the 2-category Enr+ with objects enrichments over different bases. We establish a few technical results about it that will serve us further to reason conveniently about the 2-categories Enr(H).
For convenience we write the “enrichment (A, V)” for the “V-category A”. Given a monoidal functor F : V → W, enrichments (A, V) and (B, W), and a map f : Obj(A) → Obj(B), we say that F is compatible with the triple (f, A, B) when f defines a W-functor F@A → B. Note
Remark 4.6 If F ≤ G : V → W and G is compatible with (f, A, B) then so is F .
Let E be the locally preordered 2-category defined by the following data:
objects: enrichments;
arrows from (A, V) to (B, W): ordered pairs (f, F ) where f is a map Obj(A) → Obj(B) and F : V → W is a monoidal functor compatible with (f, A, B);
horizontal composition: the composite
( (B, W) (g,G) (C , X )) ◦ ( (A, V) (f,F ) (B , W)) 
is the pair (g ◦ f, GF : V → X );
identities: (1 : Obj(A) → Obj(A), 1 : V → V) in (A, V);


2-cells: the 2-cell (f, F ) ⇒ (g, G) : A → B exists when there is a (monoidal) natural transformation F ≤ G and for any object a of A, there exists the arrow I → B(f a, ga) in W.
Enr+ is the locally preordered 2-category with objects enrichments, arrows those (f, F ) of E with F super, and local preorders inherited from E. It is straightforward to check that both E and Enr+ are well-defined 2-categories. SC − Enr+ will stand for the locally preordered 2-category with objects the skeletal and Cauchy-complete enrichments and with arrows and local preorders inherited from Enr+.
Proposition 4.7 The inclusion 2-functor SC − Enr+ → Enr+ has a 2-left- adjoint. Precisely, for any enrichment (A, V), the arrow (A, V)  (jA,1) (A¯ , V) (that lies in Enr+) is such that:
- For any arrow (A, V)  (f,F ) (B , W) in Enr+ with B skeletal and Cauchy- complete, there is a unique arrow (f¯, F¯) that renders commutative the dia- gram in E below.

This arrow (f¯, F¯) is in Enr+. It is given by F¯ = F and f¯o = fo • F (jAo).
- There is a 2-cell (f, F ) ⇒ (g, G) : (A, V) → (B, W) in Enr+ if and only if there is one (f¯, F ) ⇒ (g¯, G) : (A¯, V) → (B, W) in Enr+.
Proof. Let (f, F ) : (A, V) → (B, W) be in Enr+, B be skeletal and Cauchy- complete. We are looking for some arrow (f¯, F¯) : A¯ → B in Enr+ such that (f¯, F¯) ◦ (jA, 1V ) = (f, F ). Necessarily F¯ = F . Since F is super, F (jAo) is an isomorphism in W − Mod (4.5) and the composition on the right by F (jAo) (see below),

yields an isomorphism of categories W − Mod(F@A¯, B) ∼= W − Mod(F@A, B). Thus by Cauchy-completeness and skeletality of B, the composition on the right by F@(jA) is an isomorphism W − Cat(F@A¯, B) ∼= W − Cat(F@A, B). Therefore the required f¯ exists and is unique, it satisfies f¯o = fo • F (jAo). Given another functor (g, G) : (A, V) → (B, W), we have to show that there is


a natural transformation (f, F ) ⇒ (g, G) if and only if there is one (f¯, F ) ⇒ (g¯, G) where g¯ is such that g¯ ◦ G@(jA) = g : G@A → B in W − Cat. Let us write θA : F@A → G@A and θA¯ : F@A¯ → G@A¯ respectively for the components in A and A¯ of the V-natural transformation θ : F@ → G@ induced by F ≤ G. θA and θA¯ are W-functors with underlying maps the identities of Obj(A) and Obj(A¯). The diagram in W − Cat below commutes.

By 2-functoriality of (−)o : W −Cat → W −Mod and since F and G preserve isomorphisms, it is now straightforward that the 2-cell (1) exists if and only the 2-cell (2) exists. This is equivalent to the desired result according to 3.5

Consider 2-functors H : C → A and K : B → A. Then one may construct the pullback C ×H,K B of H and K in the category 2 − Cat, with projections πH and πK as below.

If a 2-functor H : C → SMon is such that C is locally partially ordered and U denotes the forgetful 2-functor Enr+ → SMon. C ×H,U Enr+ is (2- isomorphic to) the locally preordered 2-category with:


objects: (A, s) where s is an object of C and (A, H(s)) is an enrichment;
arrows (A, s) → (B, t): the triples (f, R : s → t) where R : s → t is an arrow in C and (f, H(R)) is a morphism (A, H(s)) → (B, H(t)) in Enr+;
2-cells as follows: there is one 2-cell (f, R : s → t) ⇒ (g, P : s → t)
: (A, s) → (B, t) if and only if R ≤ P in C and I ≤ B(f a, ga) in H(t) for any object a of A.

(A, s) (f,R) (B , t) (g,P ) (C , u)


given by

(A, s()gof,P ○R ()C , u) .

C ×H,U SC − Enr+ is just (2-isomorphic) to the 2-category with objects the (A, s) of C ×H,U Enr+ with (A, H(s)) skeletal and Cauchy-complete and arrows and 2-cells inherited from C ×H,U Enr+.
From 4.7, it is straightforward that

Proposition 4.8 Given a 2-functor H : C → SMon with C locally partially ordered, the inclusion 2-functor C ×H,U SC − Enr+ → C ×H,U Enr+ has a left 2 adjoint.

Now we turn on to the 2-categories Enr(H). For the rest of the section, we consider a 2-functor H : F → SMon such that F is a locally partially ordered 2-category that is also locally ﬁltered – i.e. the homsets of F are filtered partial orders.
The locally preordered 2-categories Enr(H) and SC − Enr(H) are as follows. Enr(H) is the locally preordered 2-category with:
objects: triples (A, s) where s is an object of F and (A, H(s)) is an enrich- ment;
arrows (A, s) → (B, t): the maps f : Obj(A) → Obj(B) for which there ex- ists an R : s → t in F such that H(R) is compatible with (f, (A, H(s)), (B, H (t)));
2-cells as follows: there is one 2-cell f ⇒ g : (A, s) → (B, t) if and only if for any object a, I ≤ B(f a, ga) in H(t);
identity in (A, s): the identity map on Obj(A);


horizontal composition of (A, s)  f  (B , t)   g  (C , u) given by

(A, s)  gof  (C , u) .

SC − Enr(H) is the 2-category with objects the (A, s) of Enr(H) where (A, H(s)) is skeletal and Cauchy-complete, and arrows and 2-cells inherited from Enr(H).
It is important to note here that
Remark 4.9 If the enrichments (A, V) and (B, W) of are isomorphic in
Enr(H), then (A, V) is Cauchy-complete if and only if (B, W) is.
This results immediately from the fact that a change of base 2-functor F@ :
V − Cat → W − Cat is super and thus preserves the Cauchy-completeness.
According to 4.6, and since F is locally filtered,
Proposition 4.10 There is a 2-cell f ⇒ g : (A, s) → (B, t) in Enr(H) if and only if there exists an R : s → t in F such that there is a 2-cell (f, R) ⇒ (g, R) : (A, s) → (B, t) in F ×H,U Enr+.
Theorem 4.11 The inclusion 2-functor SC − Enr(H) → Enr(H) has a left 2-adjoint.
Proof. First, note that for any object (A, s) there exists the arrow (jA, 1) : (A, s) → (A¯, s) in F ×H,U Enr+. Thus the map jA : Obj(A) → Obj(A¯) defines a morphism of Enr(H).
Now given a morphism f : (A, s) → (B, t) in Enr(H) with B skeletal and Cauchy-complete, we know from 4.8 that the map f¯ : Obj(A¯) → Obj(B) as in 4.7, defines a morphism of Enr(H) such that the diagram
(A, s)  jA  (A¯ , s)
¸¸¸¸
¸¸¸¸	f¯
f	¸z J 
(B, t)
commutes in Enr(H). We are going to show that f¯ is the unique morphism in Enr(H) that makes this diagram commute.
Let (f, R : s → t) : (A, s) → (B, t) and (g, P : s → t) : (A¯, s) → (B, t) in
F ×H,U Enr+ such that g ◦ jA = f .
Since F is locally filtered, there is a Q : s → t in F with Q ≤ R, Q ≤ P . Then H(Q) (≤ H(R),H(P )), is compatible both with (f¯, A¯, B) and (g, A¯, B). So the following diagram commutes in Enr+:

(jA,1)

	 ( 
(f¯,H(Q))

(A, H(s))(g,H(Q)) B, H(t))
According to 4.7, one deduces that the maps f¯ and g are equal.
Now let us see that for (A, s) and (B, t) with B skeletal and Cauchy- complete, the assignments f '→ f¯ defines a preorder isomorphism:
Enr(H)[(A, s), (B, t)] =∼ SC − Enr(H)[(A¯, s), (B, t)].
For any morphisms f, g : (A, s) → (B, t) in Enr(H), one has:
f ⇒ g
if and only if for some arrow R : s → t in F,
(f, H(R)) ⇒ (g, H(R)) : (A, H(r)) → (B, H(t)) in Enr+ (according to 4.10) if and only if for some arrow R : s → t in F,
(f¯, H(R)) ⇒ (g¯, H(R)) : (A¯, H(s)) → (B, H(t)) in Enr+ (according to 4.7) if and only if f¯ ⇒ g¯ : (A¯, s) → (B, t) in Enr(H) (according to 4.10).


Quasi-uniform  triples
This section introduces quasi-uniform triples and their morphisms. Quasi- uniform triples are just the algebraic version of the lattice of quasi-uniformi-
ties. They may be seen as quasi-uniformities without points. The purpose of this section is to establish the existence of a 2-functor F5 : QU T → SMon from a locally partially ordered 2-category QU T of quasi-uniform triples and their morphisms to the locally partially ordered 2-category SMon of monoidal partial orders and super monoidal functors between them. To get this result it appears necessary to introduce canonical morphisms of quasi-uniform triples. We obtain a locally partially ordered 2-category CQUT , with objects quasi-uniform triples and with arrows the canonical quasi-uniform triple morphisms. F5 is obtained as a composition QU T → CQUT → SMon.
Definition 5.1 [Quasi-uniform triples] A quasi-uniform triple (S, ·, ≤) con- sists of a semi-group (S, ·) with base S, composition operation “·”, with S partially ordered by ≤. It satisfies moreover the following axioms:
∀s, t ∈ S, (s · t ≥ s) ∧ (s · t ≥ t);
∀s, t, u ∈ S, t ≤ u ⇒ (s · t ≤ s · u) ∧ (t · s ≤ u · s);
∀s ∈ S, ∃t ∈ S, t2 ≤ s;
≤ is filtered, i.e. ∀s, t ∈ S, ∃u ∈ S, u ≤ s ∧ u ≤ t.


From Quasi-uniform Triples to Complete Biclosed Categories
For the quasi-uniform triple (S, ·, ≤), we define the following. The operation “·” is extended to ℘(S) by V · W = {s · t | s ∈ V, t ∈ W }. Further on, for some V ⊆ S, [V ] will denote the upper-closure of V with respect to ≤. IS will stand for the set of upper-closed subsets of S. A binary operation ⊗ in IS is defined by V ⊗ W = [V · W ]. We define the operation ρ on IS by ρ(V ) = S ⊗ V ⊗ S. Note that according to 5.1-(iii), S ⊗ S = S. From this, one checks that ρ is indeed a lower closure operation (it is monotonous and
decreasing with respect to the inclusion and idempotent). OS will stand for the sets of fixpoints for ρ. It is stable for ⊗ since for any V, W ∈ OS,
V ⊗ W = S ⊗ V ⊗ S ⊗ S ⊗ W ⊗ S
= S ⊗ S ⊗ V ⊗ S ⊗ S ⊗ W ⊗ S ⊗ S
= S ⊗ V ⊗ W ⊗ S.
Therefore OS provided with the restriction of ⊗ – still denoted ⊗, is a monoid with S as neutral element.
Remark 5.2 Given a quasi-uniform triple (S, ·, ≤), W and a family (Vi)i∈I both in IS, W ⊗( i∈I Vi) =  i∈I (W ⊗Vi) and ( i∈I Vi)⊗W =  i∈I (Vi⊗W ).
Proposition 5.3 Given a quasi-uniform triple (S, ·, ≤), a monoidal partial order CS is deﬁned by the following data:
objects: elements of OS;
order: inclusion;
identity: S;
tensor product: ⊗.
CS is cocomplete (and thus complete) and biclosed. The least upper bound a greatest lower bounds in CS are as follows: for any family (Vi)i∈I,
  Vi =  Vi,
i∈I	i∈I
  Vi = ρ(  Vi).
i∈I	i∈I
Proof. Checking that CS is a monoidal partial order is straightforward. Let us see that it is cocomplete. For any family (Vi)i∈I of elements OS,	i∈I Vi
=  i∈I S ⊗ Vi ⊗ S =  i∈I Vi. Therefore  i∈I Vi is the least upper bound of
the Vi’s in OS. Since ρ : (IS, ⊆) → (OS, ⊆) is a right adjoint, it preserves
greatest lower bounds. Thus CS has greatest lower bounds as above. CS with inclusion ordering has a least upper bound S and greatest lower bound ∅. CS is biclosed: for any V, V ',W ∈ OS,


V ' ⊗ V ⊆ W if and only if
V ' ⊆ {s ∈ S | ∀t ∈ V, s · t ∈ W } if and only if
V ' ⊆ ρ({s ∈ S | ∀t ∈ V, s · t ∈ W }).
Analogously, V ⊗V ' ⊆ W if and only if V ' ⊆ ρ({s ∈ S | ∀t ∈ V, t·s ∈ W }). 

Morphisms of Quasi-uniform Triples
Recall that given a binary relation R ⊆ S × T , the maps

⎧⎨ ∃R : ℘(S) → ℘(T ),
⎩ V '→ {u' | ∃u ∈ V, R(u, u')}
and
⎨ ∀R : ℘(T ) → ℘(S),
⎩ V ' '→ {u | ∀u' ∈ T, R(u, u') ⇒ u' ∈ V '}
defines an adjoint pair ∃R E ∀R : ℘(S) → ℘(T ), the powersets ℘(S) and
℘(T ) being partially ordered with inclusion (For any V ⊆ S and V ' ⊆ T ,
∃R(V ) ⊆ V ' ⇔ V ⊆ ∀R(V ')).
The assignments S '→ ℘(S) and R '→ ∃R defines a 2-functor from Rel,
the locally partially ordered 2-category of relations with sets as objects, arrows as relations, and with relation inclusion for local partial orders, to Cat the 2-category of small categories. Moreover the local components of this 2-functor are full, i.e. for any P, Q ⊆ S × T , P ⊆ Q if and only if for the pointwise ordering ∃P ≤ ∃Q. So ∃ as a functor is faithful. These local components also preserve least upper bounds: for any family of relations (Ri ⊆ S × T )i∈I , ∃Si∈I Ri =  i∈I ∃Ri .
Definition 5.4 Given two quasi-uniform triples S and T , a morphism from
S to T is a relation R ⊆ S × T such that:
∃R(S) = T ;
∀s1, s2 ∈ S, ∀t ∈ T , R(s2, t) ∧ (s1 ≤ s2) ⇒ R(s1, t);
∀s ∈ S, ∀t1, t2 ∈ T , R(s, t1) ∧ (t1 ≤ t2) ⇒ R(s, t2);
∀s1, s2 ∈ S, ∀t1, t2 ∈ T , R(s1, t1) ∧ R(s2, t2) ⇒ R(s1s2, t1t2).
For any quasi-uniform triple S, its partial order ≤⊆ S × S is a morphism of quasi-uniform triples. Quasi-uniform triples and their morphisms form a locally partially ordered bicategory QU T where:
the horizontal composition of S  R  T  P  U is S  P ○R  U ;
the identity at S is ≤S (thus QU T is NOT a subcategory of Rel);
the local partial orders are the inclusion relations.


Proposition 5.5 QU T is locally ﬁnitely complete. Precisely, given mor- phisms of quasi-uniform triples P, Q : S → T , the relation P ∩ Q deﬁnes a morphism S → T .
Proof. For any t ∈ T , since P and Q satisfies (i), there are some s1, s2 ∈ S such that P (s1, t) and Q(s2, t). Since S is filtered there is some s ∈ S such that s ≤ s1 and s ≤ s2. Thus since P and Q satisfy (ii), P (s, t) and Q(s, t). That P ∩ Q satisfies axioms (ii), (iii) (iv) is trivial.	 

Canonical morphisms
Consider a quasi-uniform triple morphism R : S → T . Since R satisfies 5.4-(iii) for any subsets P ⊆ S, ∃R(P ) is upper closed.
Also,
Proposition 5.6 For any subsets P, Q of S,
∃R(P ) ⊗ ∃R(Q) = [{v1 · v2 | (∃u1 ∈ P, R(u1, v1)) ∧ (∃u2 ∈ Q, R(u2, v2))]
⊆ [{v | ∃u1 ∈ P, u2 ∈ Q, R(u1 · u2, v)}], by 5.4-(iv)
= ∃R(P ⊗ Q).
Definition 5.7 A quasi-uniform triple morphism R : S → T is said canon- ical when one of the following equivalent assertions hold:
For any V ∈ IS, ∃R(V ) belongs to OT ;
For all s ∈ S, the upper set {t ∈ T | R(s, t)} belongs to OT ;
∀s ∈ S, t ∈ T, R(s, t) ⇒ ∃t1, t2, t3 ∈ T, t ≥ t1t2t3 ∧ R(s, t2).
Let us just check the implication (2) ⇒ (1), the other implications are trivial. Supposing (2), one has for any V ∈ IV ,
∃R(V ) = ∃R( s∈V ↑ s)
	
=  s∈V (S ⊗ ∃R(↑ s) ⊗ S) ∈ OT according to 5.3.

Proposition 5.8 Given a quasi-uniform triple morphism R : U → T , there is a larger canonical morphism R¯ amongst subrelations of R. It is deﬁned for all s ∈ S and t ∈ T by:
R¯(s, t) ⇔  ∃t1, t2, t3 ∈ T, t ≥ t1t2t3 ∧ R(s, t2).
Proof. The R¯ defined above is trivially a subrelation of R. Let us check that it is a morphism of quasi-uniform triples (5.4).
R¯ satisfies (i). For any t ∈ T , there is some t' ∈ T such that t'4 ≤ t. Since
R satisfies axiom (i), there is an s ∈ S such that R(s, t'), and thus R¯(s, t).



R¯ trivially satisfies axioms (ii) and (iii).  Let us see that R¯
satisfies

(iv). Suppose s1, s2 ∈ S, t1, t2 ∈ T , R¯(s1, t1) and R¯(s2, t2). Then there are u1, u2, u3, v1, v2, v3 ∈ T such that t1 ≥ u1u2u3, R(s1, u2), t2 ≥ v1v2v3 and R(s2, v2). Then t1t2 ≥ u1u2u3v1v2v3 ≥ u1u2v2v3 and R(s1s2, u2v2).
R¯ is canonical.  Suppose that R¯(s, t) then there are t1, t2, t3 ∈ T with
R(s, t2) and t ≥ t1t2t3. There are t'1, t'3 such that (t'1)2 ≤ t1 and (t'3)2 ≤ t3. Thus for t'2 = t' t t' , R¯(s, t' ) and t ≥ t' t' t' .
R¯ is maximal amongst the canonical P ⊆ R. Given a canonical P ⊆ R, then for all s ∈ S, t ∈ T ,
P (s, t) ⇒ ∃t1, t2, t3 ∈ T, P (s, t2) ∧ t ≥ t1t2t3
⇒ ∃t1, t2, t3 ∈ T, R(s, t2) ∧ t ≥ t1t2t3
⇔ R¯(s, t).

Corollary 5.9 For any quasi-uniform triple morphism R, R¯ = R¯.

Proof.
R¯ ⊆ R¯, and R¯
is the largest canonical morphism included in R¯.

Thus since R¯ is canonical, R¯ ⊆ R¯.	 
Consider the partial order ≤S ⊆ S × S, we will write ±S for the relation
≤S. ±S is the relation given for all s, t ∈ S by: s±St ⇔ ∃t1, t3 ∈ S, t ≥ t1st3.

Then for any quasi-uniform triple morphism R : S → T , composite ±T ◦R.
One has also
R¯ is just the

Proposition 5.10 If the quasi-uniform triple morphism R : S → T is canonical then R◦ ±S= R.
Proof. Since ±S is a subrelation of ≤S then (R◦ ±S) is a subrelation of (R◦ ≤S) = R. Conversely, suppose R(s, t). Since R is canonical, there are t1, t2, t3 ∈ T such that t ≥ t1t2t3 and R(s, t2). Now there are some s1, s3 ∈ S such that R(s1, t1) and R(s3, t3). Thus R(s1ss3, t) showing (R◦ ±S)(s, t). 
Proposition 5.11 The composition of canonical morphisms is canonical. Precisely, for any •  P  • Q  • in QU T , Q ◦ P = Q¯ ◦ P¯.
Proof.

Q ◦ P = ± ◦Q ◦ P
= Q¯ ◦ P
= Q¯◦ ± ◦P - according to 5.10
= Q¯ ◦ P¯.
 
We define CQUT as the partially ordered 2-category with quasi-uniform


triples as objects, canonical morphisms as arrows and with composition of arrows and local partial orders inherited from QU T . The identity at S in CQUT is ±S, thus CQUT is NOT a subcategory of QU T . According to the results of this section, one gets

Proposition 5.12 There is a 2-functor (−) : QU T → CQUT that is the identity on objects and sends a morphism R to R¯. The components (−)S,T : QU T (S, T ) → CQUT (S, T ) are closure relations, i.e. they are right adjoints to the inclusions CQUT (S, T ) → QU T (S, T ).

Canonical morphisms and super functors
Consider a quasi-uniform triple morphism R : S → T . Then for any V ∈ IS,
∃R(V ) ∈ IT . Thus we define the two maps δ(R) : IS → IT and δ¯(R) : OS → OT as follows. δ(R) is the restriction of ∃R on IS, and δ¯(R) = ρ ◦ δ(R) ◦ i, where i denotes there the embedding OS → IS (see below)
I  δ(R)  I

By definition, for any morphism of quasi-uniform triple, R : S → T , the following diagram commutes
℘(S)  ∃R  ℘( T )

IS	δ(R)  IT 
From this one gets that for any •  R  •  P  • ∈ QU T , δ(P ◦ R) = δ(P ) ◦
δ(R). Also for any quasi-uniform triple S, δ(≤S) is the identity on IS, thus
Proposition 5.13 The assignments S '→ (IS, ⊆) and R '→ δ(R) deﬁne a 2-functor F1 : QU T → Cat.
Moreover the local components F1S,T : QU T (S, T ) → Cat(IS, IT ) are full, thus F1, as a functor, is faithful.
Given a quasi-uniform triple S, for any V ∈ IS, ρS(V ) = ∃±S (V ) i.e.

From this one deduces

Proposition 5.15 The assignments S '→ (OS, ⊆) and R '→ δ¯(R) deﬁne a 2-functor F2 : CQUT → Cat.
Proposition 5.16 Given S  R  T  in QU T , R¯ is the unique canonical
morphism S  P  T such that δ¯(P ) = δ¯(R), i.e. F2 as a functor is faithful. Precisely the local components of F2 are full.
Proof. If R : S → T is canonical then
δ¯(R¯) = δ¯(± ◦R)
= ρ ◦ δ(± ◦R) ◦ i


= ρ ◦ δ(±) ◦ δ(R) ◦ i, by functoriality of F1,
= ρ ◦ δ(R) ◦ i
= δ¯(R).
Now suppose that R, P : S → T are both canonical. Then according to

5.14, one has:
δ¯(R) ⊆ δ¯(P ) if and only if δ(R) ⊆ δ(P ). The result follows

then from the fact that the local components of F1 are full.	 

Eventually we define F3 = F2 ◦ (−) : QU T → Cat. Note that according to 5.16, for any morphism R of quasi-uniform triple F3(R) = δ¯(R).
Proposition 5.17 Given a morphism R : S → T of quasi-uniform triple,
δ(R) : IS → IT preserves least upper bounds.
δ¯(R) : OS → OT preserves least upper bounds.
Proof. Since ∃R : (℘(S), ⊆) → (℘(T ), ⊆) is a left adjoint and any union of upper-closed subsets is upper-closed, δ(R) : (I(S), ⊆) → (I(T ), ⊆) pre- serves unions, i.e. least upper bounds. Since i : (O(S), ⊆) → (I(S), ⊆) and ρ : (I(T ), ⊆) → (O(T ), ⊆) also preserves least upper bounds (see 5.2), δ¯(R) = ρ ◦ δ(R) ◦ i : (O(S), ⊆) → (O(T ), ⊆) preserves least upper bounds. 

Proposition 5.18 For any morphism of quasi-uniform triples R : S → T , the map δ¯(R) deﬁnes a normal super monoidal functor CS → CT .
Proof. Since δ(R)(S) = T , δ¯(R)(S) = ρ ◦ δ(R)(S) = ρ(T ) = T . For any V, W ∈ OS,
δ¯(R)(V ⊗ W ) = ρ ◦ δ(R) ◦ i(V ⊗ W )
⊇ ρ(δ(R) ◦ i(V ) ⊗ δ(R) ◦ i(W )), (see 5.6)
⊇ (ρ ◦ δ(R) ◦ i)(V ) ⊗ (ρ ◦ δ(R) ◦ i)(W )
= δ¯(R)(V ) ⊗ δ¯(R)(W )
Let us see that δ¯(R) is super. Let (Vi, Wi)i∈I be a family of pairs of objects
in CS such that S ⊆  i∈I Vi ⊗ Wi. Given t ∈ T there is a t ∈ T such that

t'2 ≤ t. Since T = δ¯(R)(S) = δ¯(R)( 
i∈I
Vi ⊗ Wi) = 
i∈I
δ¯(R)(Vi ⊗ Wi),

for this t' there is some i ∈ I, such that t' ∈ δ¯(R)(Vi ⊗ Wi). Thus t' ∈
δ¯(R)(Vi) ∩ δ¯(R)(Wi) and t ∈ δ¯(R)(Vi) ⊗ δ¯(R)(Wi).	 

Eventually,

Proposition 5.19 The assignments S '→ OS and R '→ δ¯(R) deﬁne a 2- functor F4 : QU T → SMon. Considering its restriction F5 to CQUT, one has the factorization in 2 − CAT

Abstract Quasi-uniformities
This section introduces abstract quasi-uniformities and their morphisms. They form together a locally preordered 2-category AQU nif that “lies in between” the 2-category QU nif of uniformities and uniformly continuous maps and the 2-category of enrichments Enr(F5). Any quasi-uniformity defines naturally an abstract one and the nature of the correspondence between QU nif and AQU nif will be detailed in section 8. In the other direction, we define canonical quasi-abstract uniformities that correspond to enrichments. They form together with abstract quasi-uniformity mor- phisms between them a locally preordered 2-category CAQUnif that is 2-isomorphic to Enr(F5), (F5 : QU T → SMon was defined in section 5) and 2-equivalent to AQU nif .

A few deﬁnitions
Definition 6.1 An abstract quasi-uniformity A over a quasi-uniform triple S denoted also (A, S), is a set Obj(A) together with a map: A(−, −) : Obj(A) × Obj(A) → IS that satisfies:
∀x, y, z ∈ Obj(A), A(y, z) ⊗ A(x, y) ⊆ A(x, z),
∀x ∈ Obj(A), S ⊆ A(x, x).
Let S, T , U be quasi-uniform triples, and A, B and, C be abstract quasi- uniformities respectively over S, T and U .
Definition 6.2 Let f be a map Obj(A) → Obj(B). A relation R ⊆ S × T is said compatible with the triple (f, A, B) — or simply “with f ”, when there is no ambiguity — when for all s ∈ S, t ∈ T , for all x, y ∈ Obj(A), s ∈ A(x, y) ∧ R(s, t) ⇒ t ∈ B(f x, fy).
Note that if R : S → T is a morphism then it is compatible with (f, A, B) if and only if for all objects x, y of A, δ(R)A(x, y) ⊆ B(f x, fy).
The set of compatible relations with some (f, A, B) is closed under arbi- trary unions and subrelations. The largest relation compatible with (f, A, B) is denoted Rf,A,B (or simply Rf ), it is defined for all s ∈ S and t ∈ T by Rf (s, t) if and only if ∀x, y ∈ Obj(A),s ∈ A(x, y) ⇒ t ∈ B(f x, fy). Rf


satisfies the conditions (ii) and (iii) of 5.4. If the relation P is compatible with (f, A, B) and Q is compatible with (g, B, C) then Q ◦ P is compatible (g ◦ f, A, C).
We define the locally preordered 2-categories AQU nif + and AQU nif
as follows. Both have objects abstract quasi-uniformities. A morphism of AQU nif + : (A, S) → (B, T ) consists in a pair (f, R) where f is a map Obj(A) → Obj(B) and R is a morphism S → T of quasi-uniform triples that is compatible with (f, A, B). The composite of arrows
(A, S)  (f,P ) (B , T )  (g,Q) (C , U )

is (A, S()g○f,Q○P ()C , U ) . The identity morphism in (A, S) is the pair (1 , ≤ ⊆ S ×S). The local preorders AQU nif +((A, S), (B, T )) are given by (f, R) ⇒ (g, P ) if and only if R ⊆ P and for all object x of A, T ⊆ B(f x, gx).
Morphisms (A, S) → (B, T ) in AQU nif , that we shall call morphisms of quasi-uniformities, are the maps f : Obj(A) → Obj(B) for which there exists an R : S → T in QU T compatible with. The composition of arrows in
AQU nif is given by the underlying map composition and the identity mor- phisms correspond to identity maps. The local preorders AQU nif ((A, S), (B, T )) are given by: f ≤ g if and only if for all object x of A, T ⊆ B(f x, gx). There is an obvious forgetful 2-functor AQU nif + → AQU nif .
Remark 6.3 Given a morphism of AQU nif +, (f, R) : (A, S) → (B, T ), since R satisfies 5.4-(i) and is compatible with f , then
∀t ∈ T, ∃s ∈ S, ∀x, y ∈ Obj(A),s ∈ A(x, y) ⇒ t ∈ B(f x, fy)
Canonical abstract quasi-uniformities
Let S be some quasi-uniform triple. An enrichment of the form (A, CS) corresponds exactly to an abstract quasi-uniformity (A, S) where the map A(−, −) takes its values in OS. An abstract quasi-uniformity satisfying the latter property is called canonical.
First we define the locally preordered 2-category CAQUnif + that is 2- isomorphic to CQUT ×F ,U Enr+. Its objects are the canonical abstract quasi-uniformities, its morphisms, the (f, R) : (A, S) → (B, T ) of AQU nif + with R canonical.  The unit at (A, S) is the pair (1A, ±S) where 1A is the identity map on Obj(A) (Thus CAQUnif + is NOT a sub-2-category of AQU nif +). The local preorders on CAQUnif + are inherited from AQU nif +.
We define for any abstract quasi-uniformity A over S, the canonical ab- stract quasi-uniformity C(A) over S, as follows. It has the same objects as


A and for any x, y ∈ Obj(A), C(A)(x, y) = ρ(A(x, y)). For any morphism (f, R) : A → B in AQU nif +, since for all x, y ∈ Obj(A),
δ(R¯) ◦ ρ(A(x, y)) = ρ ◦ δ(R) ◦ i ◦ ρ(A(x, y))
⊆ ρ ◦ δ(R)(A(x, y))
⊆ ρ(B(f x, fy)),

we let C(f, R) denote the morphism (f, R¯) : C(A) → C(B) in CAQUnif +.
According to the 2-functoriality of (−) : QU T → CQUT (5.12),
Proposition 6.4 The assignments A '→ C(A) and (f, R) '→ C(f, R) deﬁne a 2-functor C : AQU nif + → CAQUnif +.
Remark 6.5 Given a morphism (A, S) (f,R) (B , T ) of abstract quasi-uni- formities, since R¯ ⊆ R, the pair (f, R¯) defines also a morphism (A, S) → (B, T ).
According to this, the local components of C : AQU nif + → CAQUnif +
are coreflections.
Eventually we define the 2-category CAQUnif of AQU nif .  Its ob- jects are the canonical abstract quasi-uniformities, its arrows and local pre- orders are inherited from AQU nif . According to 6.5, it is 2-isomorphic to Enr(F5) (from 5.5, QU T is locally filtered) and there is a forgetful 2-functor CAQUnif + → CAQUnif that is full as a functor.
Let (A, S) be an abstract quasi-uniformity. Since for any objects x, y of A, ρ(A(x, y)) ⊆ A(x, y), there is a morphism C(A) → A of AQU nif + defined by the pair (1A, ≤S). Now ±S is compatible with (1A, A, C(A)). Thus the pair (1A, ±S) defines a morphism A → C(A) of AQU nif +. This shows that A ∼= C(A) in AQU nif , thus
Proposition 6.6 AQU nif and CAQUnif are 2-equivalent. The follow- ing diagrams in 2 − CAT involving that equivalence, the above C and the forgetful 2-functors commute.

Completions
In this section we define notions of Cauchy filter, neighborhood filter, sepa- ration and completeness for abstract quasi-uniformities, that correspond to


the classical notions for quasi-uniformities. We identify the equivalent no- tions in terms of enrichments. For an abstract quasi-uniformity A and the corresponding enrichment C(A) via the equivalence AQU nif ∼= Enr(F5):
beginitemize
Minimal Cauchy filters on A and left adjoint modules 1	○ C (A) are in bijective correspondence;
The separation and completeness of A are equivalent respectively to the skeletality and the Cauchy-completeness of C(A).
Via the above equivalence C, we infer from the Cauchy-completion in Enr(F5), a completion for abstract quasi-uniformities (the completion of the abstract quasi-uniformity A corresponds via C to the Cauchy-completion of C(A)). We will prove in chapter 8 how retrieve the classical bicompletion of quasi- uniformities from the completion of abstract ones.

Cauchy ﬁlters / adjoint modules
In this subsection, (A, S) is an abstract quasi-uniformity.
Definition 7.1 [Cauchy filters] A filter F on Obj(A) is Cauchy when it sat- isfies
(∗) ∀u ∈ U, ∃f ∈ F, ∀x, y ∈ f, u ∈ A(x, y)
A filter basis is Cauchy when the filter that it generates is Cauchy.
In the definition above we could have replaced the condition (∗) by: (∗∗) ∀u ∈ U, ∃f ∈ F, ∀x, y ∈ f, u ∈ A(x, y) ⊗ A(y, x).
Proposition 7.2 Let f : (A, S) → (B, T ) be a morphism of abstract quasi-
uniformities. If F is a Cauchy ﬁlter on (A, S) then f (F ), the direct image of
F by f is a Cauchy basis on (B, T ).
Proof. Since the direct image of any filter is a filter basis, it remains to check that f (F ) is Cauchy. Let t ∈ T . According to 6.3, we may find some s ∈ S such that ∀x, y ∈ Obj(A),s ∈ A(x, y) ⇒ t ∈ B(f x, fy). Since F is Cauchy, there is p ∈ F such that ∀x, y ∈ Obj(A), x,y ∈ p ⇒ s ∈ A(x, y) Then ∀x, y ∈ Obj(A), x,y ∈ p ⇒ t ∈ B(f x, fy), i.e. ∀x', y' ∈ Obj(B), x', y' ∈ f (p) ⇒ t ∈ B(x', y')	 
According to this and since the identity map defines two morphisms 1A :
A → C(A) and C(A) → A, Cauchy filters on A and C(A) are the same.
To simplify we shall suppose from now that A is canonical. We shall also denote by A the corresponding CS-category.  We shall relate adjoint pairs


ϕ E ϕ˜ : 1 ○ A and Cauchy-filters on the abstract quasi-uniformity A (7.5). A Cauchy filter F is said minimal when it is minimal for the inclusion relation on ℘(℘(Obj(A))).
Proposition 7.3 To any adjoint pair of CS-modules ϕ E ϕ˜ with ϕ : ˆ1 ○ A , corresponds a Cauchy ﬁlter Γ¯(ϕ) on Obj(A) with basis the family Γ(ϕ) of sets Γ(ϕ)(u) = {x ∈ Obj(A) | u ∈ ϕ(x)⊗ϕ˜(x)}, u ranging in S. Γ¯(ϕ) is a minimal Cauchy ﬁlter. Precisely any Cauchy ﬁlter compatible with Γ(ϕ) is ﬁner than Γ(ϕ).
Proof. Consider an adjoint pair as above.  By definition, the maps ϕ :
Obj(A) → OS, ϕ˜ : Obj(A) → OS are such that
- ∀x, y ∈ Obj(A), ϕ(x) ⊗ A(y, x) ⊆ ϕ(y);
- ∀x, y ∈ Obj(A), A(x, y) ⊗ ϕ˜(x) ⊆ ϕ˜(y).
and
S ⊆	x∈Obj(A)ϕ(x) ⊗ ϕ˜(x);
∀x, y ∈ Obj(A), ϕ˜(y) ⊗ ϕ(x) ⊆ A(x, y).
According to (1), for all u ∈ S, Γ(ϕ)(u) is non empty. Since S is filtered, for all u, v ∈ S, there is some w ∈ S with w ≤ u, w ≤ v and Γ(ϕ)(w) ⊆ Γ(ϕ)(u) ∩ Γ(ϕ)(v). Therefore the family Γ(ϕ) is a filter basis. Let us see now that this basis is Cauchy. Let u ∈ S. Consider v ∈ S such that v2 ≤ u and let x, y ∈ Γ(ϕ)(v). Then v2 ∈ ϕ(y) ⊗ ϕ˜(y) ⊗ ϕ(x) ⊗ ϕ˜(x) ⊆ ϕ˜(y) ⊗ ϕ(x). From
(2) we have u ∈ A(x, y).
Suppose now that F is a Cauchy filter compatible with Γ(ϕ). We show that F is finer than Γ(ϕ). Consider u ∈ S, we have to find some f ∈ F such that f ⊆ Γ(ϕ)(u). Let v ∈ S, such that v4 ≤ u. Choose some f ∈ F such that
∀x, y ∈ f, v ∈ A(x, y). Since F is compatible with Γ(ϕ), Γ(ϕ)(v) ∩ f /= ∅. Let x¯ ∈ Γ(ϕ)(v)∩f . Then for all y ∈ f , u ≥ v4 ∈ ϕ(x¯)⊗A(y, x¯)⊗A(x¯, y)⊗ϕ˜(x¯) ⊆ ϕ(y) ⊗ ϕ˜(y).	 
Proposition 7.4 If F is a ﬁlter basis on A then the maps

⎧⎨ ϕ : X → OS,
⎩ x '→  f ∈F  y∈f A(x, y)

⎧⎨ ϕ˜ : X → OS,

and,

⎩ x '→ f ∈F  y∈f A(y, x)
deﬁne respectively modules ϕ : ˆ1 ○ A and, ϕ˜ : A ○ ˆ1 . If F is moreover
Cauchy then ϕ E ϕ˜ and the Cauchy ﬁlter Γ¯(ϕ) (see 7.3) is less ﬁne than F.

Proof. ϕ is a module from ˆ1 to A since for all objects x, y of A, ϕ(x) ⊗ A(y, x) = (  f ∈F  z∈f A(x, z)) ⊗ A(y, x)
⊆	f ∈F	z∈f (A(x, z) ⊗ A(y, x))
⊆ ϕ(y).
Analogously ϕ˜ is a module  A ○ 1 . 
Now suppose that F is moreover a filter basis. Let us see that ϕ E ϕ˜. Let us check first S ⊆	x∈Obj(A) ϕ(x) ⊗ ϕ˜(x).

 
x∈Obj(A)
ϕ(x) ⊗ ϕ˜(x) = x∈Obj(A)(( f ∈F  y∈f A(x, y)) ⊗ ( f ∈F  y∈f A(y, x)))
=  x∈Obj(A)  f1 ,f2∈F ( y∈f1 A(x, y) ⊗  y∈f2 A(y, x))
= x∈Obj(A) f ∈F ( y∈f A(x, y) ⊗ y∈f A(y, x)),

where the last equality follows from the fact that F is filtered. Let u ∈ S. There is some v ∈ S such that u ≥ v8. Since F is Cauchy, there is some non- empty f (v) ∈ F such that x, y ∈ f (v) ⇒ v ∈ A(x, y). Then for some x ∈ f (v), v ∈ A(x, y) ∩ A(y, x) for any y ∈ f (v), v3 ∈	A(x, y) ∩	A(y, x)
and u ∈  y∈f (v) A(x, y) ⊗  y∈f (v) A(y, x).
Let us check that for any objects x, y of A, ϕ˜(x) ⊗ ϕ(y) ⊆ A(y, x). Let
x, y ∈ Obj(A),
ϕ˜(x) ⊗ ϕ(y) = (  f ∈F  z ∈f A(z, x)) ⊗ ( f ∈F  z∈f A(y, z))
=  f ∈F ( z∈f A(z, x) ⊗  z∈f A(y, z)).
L et f ∈ F . Since f is non emp ty then for som e z0 ∈ f ,  z∈f A(z, x) ⊆ A(z0, x),
z∈f A(y, z) ⊆ A(y, z0) and,	z∈f A(z, x) ⊗	z∈f A(y, z) ⊆ A(z0, x) ⊗ A(y, z0).
Thus ϕ˜(x) ⊗ ϕ(y) ⊆ A(y, x).
Now we prove that F is finer than Γ(ϕ). Let u ∈ S. There is some v ∈ S such that v2 ≤ u. Since Γ(ϕ)(v) /= ∅, we choose some x¯ ∈ Γ(ϕ)(v) i.e. v ∈ ϕ(x¯) ⊗ ϕ˜(x¯), i.e. v ≥ v1 · v2 for some v1 ∈ ϕ(x¯) and v2 ∈ ϕ˜(x¯). Thus there are some f1, f2 ∈ F such that
v1 ∈ y∈f1 A(x¯, y) ⊆  y∈f1 A(x¯, y) and,
		
Thus given y ∈ f1 ∩ f2, v1 ∈ A(x¯, y) and v2 ∈ A(y, x¯) and u ≥ v2 ≥ v1v2v1v2 ∈
ϕ(x¯) ⊗ A(y, x¯) ⊗ A(x¯, y) ⊗ ϕ˜(x¯) ⊆ ϕ(y) ⊗ ϕ˜(y). Thus f1 ∩ f2 ⊆ Γ(ϕ)(u).	 

Proposition 7.5
Γ¯ deﬁnes a bijection between adjoint pairs of modules of the

form ϕ E ϕ˜ : 1 ○ A and minimal Cauchy-ﬁlters on A.
This is a consequence of


Proposition 7.6 Given an adjoint pair ϕ E ϕ˜ : 1 ○ A then it is the pair corresponding to the Cauchy ﬁlter Γ¯(ϕ) as in 7.4, — i.e. for any object x of A, ϕ(x) =  u∈S y∈Γ(ϕ)(u) A(x, y)
Proof. It is enough to show that for any object x of A,

ϕ(x) ⊆ 
A(x, y)

u∈S y∈Γ(ϕ)(u)


since one should get analogously
ϕ˜(x) ⊆ 
A(y, x)

u∈S y∈Γ(ϕ)(u)
and we are considering two adjoint pairs.  Let x ∈ Obj(A) and u ∈ ϕ(x). u ≥ v1v2u'v3 for some v1, v2, v3 ∈ S and u' ∈ ϕ(x). For any y ∈ Γ(ϕ)(v2), by definition v2 ∈ ϕ(y) ⊗ ϕ˜(y) thus v2 ∈ ϕ˜(y) and v2u' ∈ ϕ˜(y) ⊗ ϕ(x) ⊆ A(x, y). Therefore u ≥ v v u'v ∈	A(x, y).	 
2
If F is a Cauchy-filter on A, we shall write ϕF for the corresponding left adjoint module 1 ○ A defined in 7.4. 7.3 and 7.4 show that

Proposition 7.7 For a given Cauchy ﬁlter F, Cauchy ﬁlter less ﬁne than F.
Γ¯(ϕF ) is the only minimal

Completion and separation / Cauchy-completion and skeletality
In this subsection, (A, S) will denote an abstract quasi-uniformity. and C(A) will denote the canonical abstract quasi-uniformity as well as the correspond- ing enrichment.
Given some object x of A, let B1(x), B2(x), B3(x), B4(x) denote respec- tively the set of subsets of Obj(A),
{y ∈ Obj(A) | u ∈ A(y, x) ∩ A(x, y)}, u ranging in S;
{y ∈ Obj(A) | u ∈ A(y, x) ⊗ A(x, y)}, u ranging in S;
{y ∈ Obj(A) | u ∈ ρ ◦ A(y, x) ∩ ρ ◦ A(x, y)} u ranging in S;
{y ∈ Obj(A) | u ∈ ρ ◦ A(y, x) ⊗ ρ ◦ A(x, y)}, u ranging in S.
Then B1(x), B2(x), B3(x), B4(x) are Cauchy bases for (A, S) If (A, S) is canonical then B1(x) = B3(x) and B2(x) = B4(x). These bases are equivalent in the sense that they generate the same filter on Obj(A). This filter is denoted V (x), an element of V (x) is called a neighborhood of x (in (A, S)). For any object x of A, V (x) is just Γ¯(xo) for xo : 1  ○ C (A) Thus according to 7.3, V (x) is a minimal Cauchy filter on (A, S).


This motivates the definition which is justified by 7.7
Definition 7.8 An abstract quasi-uniformity is said complete when one of the following equivalent assertion holds:
any of its Cauchy filter is finer than a filter of neighborhoods for some element;
any minimal Cauchy-filter occurs as a neighborhood filter.
Proposition 7.9 The following assertions are equivalent:
the abstract quasi-uniformity (A, S) is complete;
the canonical abstract quasi-uniformity C(A, S) is complete;
the CS-enrichment C(A) is Cauchy-complete.
We define (dually)
Definition 7.10 (A, S) is said separated when one the following equivalent assertion holds:
the map assigning any object x to the filter V (x) is injective;
For all objects x, y of A, if x /= y then there is u ∈ S such that u /∈
A(x, y) ∩ A(y, x).
The fact that the two assertions above are equivalent results from
Lemma 7.11 For all objects x, y of A, V (x) /= V (y) if and and only if there is a u ∈ S such that u /∈ A(x, y) ∩ A(y, x).
Proof. Clearly if there is a u ∈ S such that u /∈ A(x, y) ∩ A(y, x), then
y /∈ Γ(xo)(u) or x /∈ Γ(yo)(u) and V (x) /= V (y).
To see the reverse implication, suppose V (x) /= V (y). Then by minimality of V (y), V (y) is not finer than V (x). Thus there exists a u ∈ S such that for any v ∈ S, Γ(xo)(u) /≥ Γ(yo)(v). For this u choose v such that v8 ≤ u. Then v /∈ A(x, y) ∩ A(y, x) otherwise for any z ∈ Γ(yo)(v), one would have v2 ∈ A(y, z) ⊗ A(x, y) ⊆ A(x, z), v2 ∈ A(y, x) ⊗ A(z, y) ⊆ A(z, x), thus
v4 ∈ ρ(A(z, x)) ∩ ρ(A(x, z)) and v8 ∈ ρ(A(z, x)) ⊗ ρ(A(x, z)), and eventually
z ∈ Γ(xo)(u).	 
Proposition 7.12 The following assertions are equivalent:
the abstract quasi-uniformity (A, S) is separated;
the canonical abstract quasi-uniformity C(A, S) is separated;
the CS-enrichment, C(A) is skeletal.

A completion for abstract quasi-uniformities
Let us define the following 2-categories.
SC − QAU nif with:
objects: separated and complete abstract quasi-uniformities;
arrows and local preorders inherited from QAU nif .
SC − CQAUnif with:
objects: separated and complete canonical abstract quasi-uniformities;
	arrows and local preorders inherited from CQAUnif . Then
Theorem 7.13 The inclusion functor SC − QAU nif → QAU nif has a left 2-adjoint.
According to 6.6, 7.9 and 7.12, 7.13 is equivalent to
Theorem 7.14 The inclusion functor SC − CQAUnif → CQAUnif has a left 2-adjoint.
Which is just an instance of 4.11 for H = F5, according again to 7.9 and
7.12.	 

Further on we shall write (A, S) or simply A for the “completion” of the abstract quasi-uniformity (A, S) that is its image by the left adjoint in 7.13.

Let us describe A up to isomorphism in AQU nif . Its elements are the Cauchy filters of A. We shall show that given Cauchy filters F1 and F2 and u ∈ S, u ∈ A(F1, F2) if and only if there are some f1 ∈ F1 and f2 ∈ F2 such that
∀x ∈ f1,y ∈ f2,u ∈ A(x, y).

Proof. First note that the map A above defines an abstract quasi-uniformity. Then let us consider the enrichments C(A) and C(A) corresponding respec- tively to the canonical abstract quasi-uniformities isomorphic to A and A. We show that C(A) is isomorphic to the Cauchy-completion C(A) of C(A).
For two Cauchy filters F1, F2,

C(A)(F1, F2) =  ( (     A(a, y)) ⊗ ( 
  A(y, a)) )

a∈A	f2 ∈F2 y∈f2
f1∈F1 y∈f1

since for any family Vi ∈ IS, ρ(∩i∈IVi) = ρ(∩i∈Iρ(Vi)). Which means that u ∈ C(A)(F1, F2) if and only there is a ∈ A, f1 ∈ F , f2 ∈ F2, u1, v1, t1, u2, v2, t2 ∈ S such that u ≥ u2v2t2u1v1t1 and for all y1 ∈ f1, y2 ∈ f2, u1 ∈ A(y1, a) and u2 ∈ A(a, y2). Thus if u ∈ C(A)(F1, F2) considering the situation as above
one has u ≥ u2v2v1t1 with v2v1 ∈ A(F1, F2), thus u ∈ ρ(A(F1, F2)).



Conversely, let u ∈ ρ(A(F1, F2)).  Then there are f1 ∈ F1, f2 ∈ F2, u1, u2, u3 ∈ S, such that u ≥ u1u2u3 and for all y1 ∈ f1, y2 ∈ f2, u2 ∈ A(y1, y2). Let t1 such that t14 ≤ u3. Choosing g1 ∈ F1 such that ∀x, y ∈ g1, t1 ∈ A(x, y) and choosing a ∈ f1 ∩ g1. Then u ≥ u1u2t4, for all y1 ∈ f1 ∩ g1, t1 ∈ A(y1, a) and for all y2 ∈ f2, u2 ∈ A(a, y2). This shows u ∈ C(A)(F1, F2).	 
Eventually, the unit in A of 7.13 sends any object x to V (x).

Quasi-uniformities
This section clarifies the connection between classical quasi-uniformities and abstract ones. The inclusion 2-functor P : QU nif → AQU nif has a right 2-adjoint Q. We define the concrete abstract uniformities. The 2-category with concrete abstract uniformities as objects and arrows and local preorders
inherited from AQU nif is 2-equivalent to QU nif . Both P , Q preserve the separation and completeness of objects. From this we can infer the classical bicompletion of quasi-uniformities from the completion of abstract ones.

Quasi-uniformities/abstract ones
Let (X, U ) be a quasi-uniformity. One builds a quasi-uniform triple U = (U, ◦, ⊆), where ◦ denotes the composition of relations, and ⊆ is the inclusion ordering. From (X, U ), one can built P (X, U ), the abstract quasi-uniformity over U as follows. P (X, U ) has objects the elements of X, and for any x, y ∈ X, P (X, U )(x, y) = (x, y)∈ = {u ∈ U | (x, y) ∈ U }. Let (X, U ), (Y, T ) be quasi- uniformities, and let f be a map X → Y . The relation Rf = Rf,P (X,U),P (Y,T ) ⊆ U × T (see section 6.1) is for all u ∈ U and v ∈ T
(u, v) ∈ Rf ⇔ ( ∀x, y ∈ X, (x, y) ∈ u ⇒ (f x, fy) ∈ v ).
In this case, Rf also satisfies the condition 5.4-(iv). Now f is uniformly continuous exactly when Rf (U ) = T , that is condition 5.4-(i). Thus f is uniformly continuous if and only if the map (f, Rf ) is a morphism P (X, U ) → P (Y, T ) in AQU nif +. So for an uniformly continuous map f : (X, U ) → (Y, T ), we let P (f ) denote the morphism P (X, U ) → P (Y, T ) in AQU nif with underlying map f : X → Y . Then
Proposition 8.1 The assignments (X, U ) '→ P (X, U ), f : (X, U ) → (Y, T ) '→ P (f ), deﬁnes a 2-functor P : QU nif → AQU nif . The local components of P are isomorphisms.
Conversely, let (A, S) be an abstract quasi-uniformity, one may built a quasi-uniformity denoted Q(A) = (A, Sˆ) with elements the objects of A, as



follows.
Sˆ has basis the set, say B, of sets sˆ = {(x, y) | s ∈ A(x, y)}, s

ranging in S. Let us check that B is a basis of a quasi-uniformity. For any
s ∈ S, ∆ ⊆ sˆ since for any s ∈ S, s ∈ A(x, x). The assignment s '→ sˆ defines a monotonous map S → ℘(Obj(A) × Obj(A)), thus B is filtered since S is.
Note that for any s, t ∈ S, sˆ ◦ tˆ ⊆ sˆ◦ t. So, for any p ∈ B, since p = sˆ for
some s ∈ S there is some t ∈ S such that t2 ≤ s and (tˆ)2 ⊆ t^2 ⊆ p.
Let (f, R) : (A, S) → (B, T ) be a morphism of AQU nif +. According to 6.3, f is a uniformly continuous map Q(A) → Q(B). We let Q(f ) denote this arrow in QU nif .
Proposition 8.2 The assignments A '→ Q(A) and f : (A, S) → (B, T ) '→
Q(f ) deﬁne a 2-functor Q AQU nif → QU nif . Trivially the Q ◦ P ∼= 1.
Definition 8.3 An abstract uniformity (A, S) is said concrete when it satis- fies: (∀s, t ∈ S)(∀x, y ∈ Obj(A))
t ◦ s ∈ A(x, y)	⇒	(∃z ∈ Obj(A)) s ∈ A(x, z) ∧ t ∈ A(z, y).
Observe that (A, S) is concrete exactly when for all s, t ∈ S, s ◦ t ⊆ sˆ ◦ tˆ. For any quasi-uniformity (X, U ), the abstract quasi-uniformity P (X, U ) is concrete.
Now given two abstract uniformities (A, S) and (B, T ) with A concrete and a map f : Obj(A) → Obj(B), the relation Rf,A,B (see section 6.1) satisfies conditions of 5.4-(iv), as shown below. For all s, s' ∈ S and t, t' ∈ T , such that Rf (s, t) and Rf (s', t'), one has:
∀x, y ∈ Obj(A), s' ◦ s ∈ A(x, y) ⇒ ∃z ∈ Obj(A), s ∈ A(x, z) ∧ s' ∈ A(z, y)
⇒ t ∈ B(f x, fz) ∧ t' ∈ B(fz, fy)
⇒ t' ◦ t ∈ B(f x, fy).
From this one gets that for any quasi-uniformity (X, U ) and any abstract quasi-uniformity (A, S), a map f : X → Obj(A) is uniformly continuous (X, U ) → Q(A, S) if and only Rf,P (X,U),(A,S) is a morphism of quasi-uniform triples U → S. Thus one gets a 2-natural isomorphism
QU nif ((X, U ), Q(A, S)) ∼=(X,U),(A,S) AQU nif (P (X, U ), (A, S))
i.e.,
Proposition 8.4 There is a 2-adjunction P E Q : QU nif ~ AQU nif .
Let (A, S) be an abstract quasi-uniformity, the component in (A, S), P ◦ Q(A, S) → (A, S), of the co-unit of the previous equivalence, has underlying map, the identity Obj(A) → Obj(A). Suppose now that the abstract quasi-


uniformity (A, S) is moreover concrete. Then there is a morphism of quasi- uniform triples R : S → Sˆ defined for all s ∈ S and p ∈ Sˆ by R(s, p) ⇔ sˆ ⊆ p. It is straightforward that R satisfies conditions (i), (ii), (iii), of 5.4. It satisfies
(iv) since for all s, t ∈ S, p, q ∈ Sˆ if sˆ ⊆ p and tˆ⊆ q then s ◦ t = sˆ◦ tˆ ⊆ p ◦ q.
This R is compatible with (1A, A,P ◦ Q(A)). This shows that the component in any concrete A of the co-unit of 8.4 is an isomorphism. Thus
Proposition 8.5 QU nif is 2-equivalent 2-category with objects concrete ab- stract uniformities, and morphisms and local preorders inherited from AQU nif .
Bicompletion of quasi-uniformities
We show now how to retrieve 2.1 from 7.13 by proving that the inclusion SC − QU nif → QU nif has a left 2-adjoint with action on objects (X, U ) '→ QP (X, U ).
According to our definition of Cauchy filters and neighborhood filters on abstract quasi-uniformities (7.1 and section 7.2), P and Q preserve the sepa- ration and completeness of objects.
First we need to show
Lemma 8.6 Given a quasi-uniformity (X, U ), the component of the co-unit of the adjunction P E Q in P (X, U ) (8.4), ϵ : P QP (X, U ) → P (X, U )
P (X,U )
is an isomorphism.
Proof. Since the components of unit of 8.4 are isomorphisms, the co-unit ϵP (X,U) : P ◦ Q ◦ P (X, U ) → P (X, U ), in P (X, U ) is an isomorphism. Consider then the following commuting diagram in QAU nif .

P ◦ Q ◦ P (
P ○Q(jP (X,U ))
єP (X,U )
X, U )~=
 P (X, U )
jP (X,U )

J			J 
P ◦ Q ◦ P (X, Uє ) 	 P (X, U )
P (X,U )

where j denotes the unit of the 2-adjunction 7.13. Since P ◦ Q ◦ P (X, U ) is separated and complete, there is a unique morphism of quasi-uniformities r

such that r ◦ j
P (X,U )
= P ◦ Q(j
P (X,U )
) ◦ (ϵP (X,U )
)−1. Thus j
= ϵ ◦
P (X,U )

r ◦ jP (X,U) showing ϵP (X,U ) ◦ r = 1. Since ϵP (X,U ) is also a monomorphism, it
is an isomorphism.	 
Now one has the following sequence of 2-natural isomorphisms between 2-functors QU nif × SC − QU nif → Cat
QU nif ((X, U ), (Y, V )) ∼=(X,U),(Y,V )

AQU nif (P (X, U ),P (Y, V )) ∼=(X,U),(Y,V )
SC − AQU nif (P (X, U ),P (Y, V )) =∼
SC − AQU nif (P QP (X, U ),P (Y, V )) ∼=(X,U),(Y,V )
SC − QU nif (QP (X, U ), (Y, V )).
