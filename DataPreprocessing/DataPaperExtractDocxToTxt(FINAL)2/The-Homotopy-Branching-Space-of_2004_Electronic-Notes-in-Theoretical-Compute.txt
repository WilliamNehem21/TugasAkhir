Abstract
In this talk, I will explain the importance of the homotopy branching space functor (and of the homotopy merging space functor) in dihomotopy theory.
Keywords: concurrency, homotopy, homotopy colimit, model category, simplicial model category, exact sequence, cone, homology, localization

Introduction
In [10], the reader will be able to find a survey of the different geometric approaches of concurrency. The model category of flows was introduced in [8] to model higher dimensional automata (HDA). It allows the study of HDA up to homotopy (cf. also [6,7]). A good notion of homotopy of flows must preserve the computer scientific properties of the HDA to be modeled like the initial and final states, the deadlocks and the unreachable states. In particular, it
must preserve the direction of time, hence the terminology dihomotopy for a
contraction of directed homotopy. This way, instead of working in the category of flows itself, one can work in the localization of the category of flows with respect to dihomotopy equivalences.
I will explain in this talk the powerfulness of the homotopy branching space functor in dihomotopy theory. The corresponding papers are “Homotopy

Model category
If C is a category, one denotes by Map(C) the category whose objects are the morphisms of C and whose morphisms are the commutative squares of C.
In a category C, an object x is a retract of an object y if there exists f : x −→ y and g : y −→ x of C such that g ◦ f = Idx. A functorial factorization (α, β) of C is a pair of functors from Map(C) to Map(C) such that for any f object of Map(C), f = β(f ) ◦ α(f ).
Definition 2.1 [12,11] Let i : A −→ B and p : X −→ Y be maps in a category C. Then i has the left lifting property (LLP) with respect to p (or p has the right lifting property (RLP) with respect to i) if for any commutative square
A   α  ¸X ,
i	g  p
J  β  J 
B	Y
there exists g making both triangles commutative.
There are several versions of the notion of model category. The following definitions give the one we are going to use.
Definition 2.2 [12,11] A model structure on a category C is three subcate- gories of Map(C) called weak equivalences, cofibrations, and fibrations, and two functorial factorizations (α, β) and (γ, δ) satisfying the following proper- ties :
(2-out-of-3) If f and g are morphisms of C such that g ◦ f is defined and two of f , g and g ◦ f are weak equivalences, then so is the third.
(Retracts) If f and g are morphisms of C such that f is a retract of g and
g is a weak equivalence, cofibration, or fibration, then so is f .
(Lifting) Define a map to be a trivial cofibration if it is both a cofibration and a weak equivalence. Similarly, define a map to be a trivial fibration if it is both a fibration and a weak equivalence. Then trivial cofibrations have the LLP with respect to fibrations, and cofibrations have the LLP with respect to trivial fibrations.
(Factorization) For any morphism f , α(f ) is a cofibration, β(f ) a trivial fibration, γ(f ) is a trivial cofibration , and δ(f ) is a fibration.


Definition 2.3 [12,11] A model category is a complete and cocomplete cat- egory C together with a model structure on C.
Proposition and Definition 2.4 [12,11] A Quillen adjunction is a pair of adjoint functors F : C « D : G between the model categories C and D such that one of the following equivalent properties holds :
if f is a coﬁbration (resp. a trivial coﬁbration), then so does F (f )
if g is a ﬁbration (resp. a trivial ﬁbration), then so does G(g).
One says that F is a left Quillen functor. One says that G is a right Quillen functor.

fibrant) if and only if the canonical morphism ∅ −→ X from the initial object Definition 2.5 [12,11] An object X of a model category C is cofibrant (resp. of C to X (resp. the canonical morphism X −→ 1 from X to the final object
1) is a cofibration (resp. a fibration).
For any object X of a model category, the canonical morphism ∅X : ∅ −→
X from the initial object to X can be factored as a composite
∅ 	α(∅X )	 Q (X) 	β(∅X )	 X 
where, by definition, Q(X) is a cofibrant object which is weakly equivalent to
X. The functor Q : C −→ C is called the coﬁbrant replacement functor.

Reminder about the category of flows
In the sequel, any topological space will be supposed to be compactly gener- ated (more details for this kind of topological spaces in [1,14], the appendix of [13] and also the preliminaries of [8]).
Let n ≥ 1. Let Dn be the closed n-dimensional disk. Let Sn−1 = ∂Dn be the boundary of Dn for n ≥ 1. Notice that S0 is the discrete two-point topological space {−1, +1}. Let D0 be the one-point topological space. Let
S−1 = ∅ be the empty set. The following theorem is well-known.
Theorem 3.1 [11,12] The category of compactly generated topological spaces
Top can be given a model structure such that:
The weak equivalences are the weak homotopy equivalences.
The ﬁbrations (sometime called Serre ﬁbrations) are the continuous maps satisfying the RLP (right lifting property) with respect to the continuous maps Dn −→ [0, 1] × Dn such that x '→ (0, x) and for n ≥ 0.


The coﬁbrations are the continuous maps satisfying the LLP (left lifting property) with respect to any maps satisfying the RLP with respect to the inclusion maps Sn−1 −→ Dn.
Any topological space is ﬁbrant.
The homotopy equivalences arising from this model structure coincide with the usual one.
Definition 3.2 [8] A flow X consists of a topological space PX, a discrete space X0, two continuous maps s and t from PX to X0 and a continuous and associative map ∗ : {(x, y) ∈ PX × PX; t(x) = s(y)} −→ PX such that
of a set map f 0 : X0 −→ Y 0 together with a continuous map Pf : PX −→ PY s(x ∗ y) = s(x) and t(x ∗ y) = t(y). A morphism of flows f : X −→ Y consists such that f (s(x)) = s(f (x)), f (t(x)) = t(f (x)) and f (x ∗ y) = f (x) ∗ f (y).
The corresponding category will be denoted by Flow.

space PX is called the path space and its elements the non constant execution The topological space X0 is called the 0-skeleton of X. The topological paths of X. The initial object ∅ of Flow is the empty set. The terminal object 1 is the flow defined by 10 = {0}, P1 = {u} and necessarily u ∗ u = u.
flow Glob(Z) defined as follows: Glob(Z)0 = {0, 1}, PGlob(Z) = Z, s = 0, Definition 3.3 [8] Let Z be a topological space. Then the globe of Z is the t = 1 and the composition law is trivial.
Theorem 3.4 [8] The category of flows can be given a model structure such that:
The weak equivalences are the weak S-homotopy equivalences, that is
isomorphism of sets and f : PX −→ PY a weak homotopy equivalence of a morphism of flows f : X −→ Y such that f : X0 −→ Y 0 is an topological spaces.
The ﬁbrations are the continuous maps satisfying the RLP with respect to the morphisms Glob(Dn) −→ Glob([0, 1] × Dn) for n ≥ 0. The ﬁbrations
are exactly the morphisms of flows f : X −→ Y such that Pf : PX −→
PY is a Serre ﬁbration of Top.
The coﬁbrations are the morphisms satisfying the LLP with respect to any
map satisfying the RLP with respect to the morphisms Glob(Sn−1) −→
Glob(Dn) for n ≥ 0 and with respect to the morphisms ∅ −→ {0} and
{0, 1} −→ {0}.
Any flow is ﬁbrant.
Let Igl be the set of morphisms of flows Glob(Sn−1) → Glob(Dn) for
n ≥ 0. Denote by Igl be the union of Igl with the two morphisms of flows

R : {0, 1}→ {0} and C : ∅ ⊂ {0}.
morphism of flows ∅ −→ X from the initial object of Flow to X is a transfinite Definition 3.5 [4] An Igl-cell complex is a flow X such that the canonical composition of pushouts of elements of Igl. The full and faithful subcategory
of Flow whose objects are the Igl-cell complexes will be denoted by Iglcell.
+	+
The category Iglcell of Igl-cell complexes is a subcategory of the category
+	+
of flows which is sufficient to model higher dimensional automata (HDA), at
least those modeled by precubical sets [9,2]. This geometric model of HDA is designed to define and study equivalence relations preserving the computer- scientific properties of the HDA to be modeled so that it then suffices to work in convenient localizations of Iglcell. The properties which are preserved are for instance the initial or final states, the presence or not of deadlocks and of unreachable states [8].
The cofibrant replacement functor is a functor Q : Flow −→ Iglcell. The
flows coming from concrete HDAs are all cofibrant.

The homotopy branching space functor

paths beginning in the same way. The branching space functor P− from the The branching space of a flow is the space of germs of non-constant execution category of flows Flow to the category of compactly generated topological
spaces Top was also introduced in [8] to fit the definition of the branching semi- globular nerve of a strict globular ω-category modeling an HDA introduced in [5].
Proposition 4.1 [8,4] Let X be a flow. There exists a topological space P−X unique up to homeomorphism and a continuous map h− : PX −→ P−X satis- fying the following universal property:
For any x and y in PX such that t(x) = s(y), the equality h−(x) =
h−(x ∗ y) holds.
Let φ : PX −→ Y be a continuous map such that for any x and y of PX such that t(x) = s(y), the equality φ(x) = φ(x ∗ y) holds. Then there exists a unique continuous map φ : P−X −→ Y such that φ = φ ◦ h−.
Moreover, one has the homeomorphism

P−X ∼= .
α∈X0
P−X

where P−X := h− .


β∈X
0 Pα,βX . The mapping X '→ P−X yields a functor

P− from Flow to Top.
Definition 4.2 [8,4] Let X be a flow. The topological space P−X is called the branching space of the flow X.

f : X −→ Y such that the topological spaces P−X and P−Y are not weakly Proposition 4.3 [4] There exists a weak S-homotopy equivalence of flows homotopy equivalent.

X, by Proposition 4.1, the topological space P−X is the coequalizer of the The idea for the proof of Proposition 4.3 is as follows. For a given flow continuous map PX ×X0 PX −→ PX induced by the composition law of X and of the projection map PX ×X0 PX −→ PX on the first factor. And one cannot
expect a coequalizer to transform a objectwise weak homotopy equivalence into
a weak homotopy equivalence. One must use a kind of homotopy coequalizer instead.
If two flows are weakly S-homotopy equivalent, then they are supposed to satisfy the same computer-scientific properties. With the example above, one obtains two such flows but with very different branching spaces. But
between coﬁbrant flows, then the topological spaces P−X and P−Y are homo- Theorem 4.4 [4] If f : X −→ Y is a weak S-homotopy equivalence of flows topy equivalent.
This suggests that the definition of the branching space is the good one up to homotopy for cofibrant flows. Indeed, we have the theorems:

pair of functors P− : Flow « Top : C− is a Quillen adjunction. In particular, Theorem 4.5 [4] There exists a functor C− : Top −→ Flow such that the there is an homeomorphism P−(l−i→m Xi) ∼= l−i→m P−Xi.
Definition 4.6 The homotopy branching space hoP− X of a flow X is by definition the topological space P−Q(X).
Theorem 4.7 [4] The functor hoP− : Flow −→ Top −→ Ho(Top) satisﬁes the following universal property: if F : Flow −→ Ho(Top) is another functor
natural transformation F ⇒ P−, then the latter natural transformation factors sending weak S-homotopy equivalences to isomorphisms and if there exists a uniquely as a composite F ⇒ hoP− ⇒ P−.
Up to homotopy, the homotopy branching space hoP−(X) is well-defined and coincides with P−X for any cofibrant flow, so in particular for any flow coming from a HDA. The behavior of the branching space functor and the
homotopy branching space functor are the same up to homotopy for flows modeling HDAs and may differ for other flows.

The homotopy merging space functor
This is the dual version of the preceding functor. Some results are collected in this section about it.
Proposition 5.1 [4] Let X be a flow. There exists a topological space P+X unique up to homeomorphism and a continuous map h+ : PX −→ P+X satis- fying the following universal property :
For any x and y in PX such that t(x) = s(y), the equality h+(y) =
h+(x ∗ y) holds.
Let φ : PX −→ Y be a continuous map such that for any x and y of PX such that t(x) = s(y), the equality φ(y) = φ(x ∗ y) holds. Then there exists a unique continuous map φ : P+X −→ Y such that φ = φ ◦ h+.
Moreover, one has the homeomorphism

Definition 5.2 [4] Let X be a flow. The topological space P+X is called the
merging space of the flow X.

pair of functors P+ : Flow « Top : C+ is a Quillen adjunction. In particular, Theorem 5.3 [4] There exists a functor C+ : Top −→ Flow such that the there is an homeomorphism P+(l−i→m Xi) ∼= l−i→m P+Xi.
Definition 5.4 [4] The homotopy merging space hoP+ X of a flow X is by definition the topological space P+Q(X).
Theorem 5.5 [4] The functor hoP+ : Flow −→ Top −→ Ho(Top) satisﬁes the following universal property : if F : Flow −→ Ho(Top) is another functor
natural transformation F ⇒ P+, then the latter natural transformation factors sending weak S-homotopy equivalences to isomorphisms and if there exists a uniquely as a composite F ⇒ hoP+ ⇒ P+.
First application: studying weak dihomotopy
The class S of weak S-homotopy equivalences is an example of class of mor- phisms of flows which is supposed to preserve various computer-scientific prop- erties. This class of morphisms of flows satisfies the following properties:


The two-out-of-three axiom, that is if two of the three morphisms f , g and g ◦ f belong to S, then so does the third one: this condition means that the class S defines an equivalence relation.
The embedding functor I : Iglcell −→ Flow induces a functor I : Iglcell[S−1] −→ Flow[S−1] between the localization of respectively the category of Igl-cell complexes and the category of flows with respect to weak S-homotopy equivalences which is an equivalence of categories.
In particular, it reflects isomorphisms, that is X =∼ Y if and only if
I(X) ∼= I(Y ). In this case, one can use the whole category of flows which is a richer mathematical framework.
The class of T-homotopy equivalences was introduced in [8] to identify Igl- cell complexes equivalent from a computer-scientific viewpoint and which are
not identified in Iglcell[S−1]. Indeed, if two objects X and Y of Iglcell[S−1]
+	+
are isomorphic, then the 0-skeletons X0 and Y 0 are isomorphic. The merging
of the notions of weak S-homotopy equivalence and T-homotopy equivalence yields the class ST 0 of 0-dihomotopy equivalences.
Definition 6.1 [8] Let X be a flow. Let A and B be two subsets of X0. One
exists execution paths γ1 and γ2 of PX such that s(γ1) ∈ B, t(γ1) = s(γ2) = α says that A is surrounded by B (in X) if for any α ∈ A, either α ∈ B or there and t(γ2) ∈ B. We denote this situation by A ≪ B.
Definition 6.2 [8] Let X be a flow. Let A be a subset of X0. Then the restriction X TA of X over A is the unique flow such that (X TA)0 = A and

P (X TA) =	.
(α,β)∈A×A

equipped with the topology induced by the one of PX.
Definition 6.3 [8] A morphism of flows f : X −→ Y is a 0-dihomotopy
equivalence if and only if the following conditions are satisfied :
The morphism of flows f : X −→ Y Tf(X0 ) is a weak S-homotopy equiva- lence of flows. In particular, the set map f 0 : X0 −→ Y 0 is one-to-one.
For α ∈ Y 0\f (X0), the topological spaces P−Y and P+Y are singletons.
α	α
Y 0 ≪ f (X0).
The class of 0-dihomotopy equivalences is denoted by ST 0.
But it turns out that
Theorem 6.4 [4] The functor Iglcell[ST −1] −→ Flow[ST −1] does not re-
+	0	0
flect isomorphisms. More precisely, there exists an Igl-cell complex C3 cor-

responding to the concurrent execution of three calculations which is not iso- morphic in Iglcell[ST −1] to the directed segment I, although the same flow
+	0
C3 is isomorphic to I in Flow[ST −1].
The correct behavior is the one of ST 0 in Flow[ST −1]. Indeed, an HDA representing the concurrent execution of n processes must be equivalent to the directed segment in a good homotopical approach of concurrency. The interpretation of this fact is therefore that the class ST 0 of 0-dihomotopy equivalences is not big enough.
Definition 6.5 [4] A morphism of flows f : X −→ Y is a 1-dihomotopy equivalence if and only if the following conditions are satisfied :
The morphism of flows f : X −→ Y Tf(X0 ) is a weak S-homotopy equiva- lence of flows. In particular, the set map f 0 : X0 −→ Y 0 is one-to-one.
For α ∈ Y 0\f (X0), the topological spaces P−Y and P+Y are weakly
α	α
contractible.
Y 0 ≪ f (X0).
The class of 1-dihomotopy equivalences is denoted by ST 1.
Any 0-dihomotopy equivalence is of course a 1-dihomotopy equivalence. Moreover, the composite of a weak S-homotopy equivalence with a T-homoto- py equivalence can already give an element of ST 1\ST 0 ! And
Theorem 6.6 [4] By slightly weakening the notion of T-homotopy as above, one obtains a class of morphisms ST 1 with ST 0 ⊂ ST 1 and such that the
flows C3 and I become isomorphic in the localization Iglcell[ST −1].
+	1
There are actually two natural ways of weakening the definition of ST 0. One can replace in the statement the word singleton either by the word weakly contractible, or by the word contractible. This way, one obtains another class of morphisms ST '1 with ST '1 ⊂ ST 1 and one has:
Theorem 6.7 [4] The localizations Iglcell[ST '−1] and Iglcell[ST −1] are equi-
+	1	+	1
valent.
Unfortunately, one has
Proposition 6.8 [4] The composite of two morphisms of ST 1 does not nec- essarily belong to ST 1.
Using the homotopy branching space functor, a new class ST 2 of mor- phisms of flows is introduced.
Definition 6.9 [4] A morphism of flows f : X −→ Y is a 2-dihomotopy equivalence if and only if the following conditions are satisfied :


The morphism of flows f : X −→ Y Tf(X0 ) is a weak S-homotopy equiva- lence of flows. In particular, the set map f 0 : X0 −→ Y 0 is one-to-one.
For α ∈ Y 0\f (X0), the topological spaces hoP− Y and hoP+ Y are weakly
α	α
contractible.
Y 0 ≪ f (X0).
The class of 2-dihomotopy equivalences is denoted by ST 2.
And:
Theorem 6.10 [4] One has the equivalence of categories
Iglcell[ST −1]    Ig lcell[ST −1]
+	1	+	2
where Iglcell[ST −1] (resp. Iglcell[ST −1]) is the localization of the category of
+	1	+	2
Igl-cell complexes with respect to 1-dihomotopy equivalences (resp. 2-dihomo- topy equivalences). ST 2 is closed under composition. Moreover the embedding functor I : Iglcell −→ Flow induces an equivalence of categories
I : Iglcell[ST −1]   F low[ST −1] .
+	2	2
In particular, the functor Iglcell[ST −1] −→ Flow[ST −1] reflects isomor-

phisms.
+	2	2

The property f ∈ ST 2 and g ◦ f ∈ ST 2 =⇒ g ∈ ST 2 has no reasons to be satisfied by 2-dihomotopy equivalences. Indeed, if both g ◦ f and f are two one-to-one set maps, then g has no reasons to be one-to-one as well. Therefore in order to understand the isomorphisms of Flow[ST −1], we may introduce
another construction.
Definition 6.11 [4] Let X be a flow. Then a subset A of X0 is essential if
X0 ≪ A and if for any α ∈/ A, both topological spaces hoP− X and hoP+ X
α	α
are weakly contractible.
Definition 6.12 [4] A morphism of flows f : X −→ Y is a 3-dihomotopy equivalence if the following conditions are satisfied :
A ⊂ X0 is essential if and only if f (A) ⊂ Y 0 is essential
for any essential A ⊂ X0 there exists an essential subset B ⊂ A such that the restriction f : X TB−→ Y Tf(B) is a weak S-homotopy equivalence.
The class of 3-dihomotopy equivalences is denoted by ST 3.
Theorem 6.13 [4] The localizations Iglcell[ST −1] and Iglcell[ST −1] are equ-
+	2	+	3
ivalent and the class of morphisms ST 3 satisﬁes the two-out-of-three axiom.


Moreover the embedding functor I : Iglcell −→ Flow induces an equivalence

of categories
I : Iglcell[ST −1]   F low[ST −1] .

+	3	3
In particular, the functor Iglcell[ST −1] −→ Flow[ST −1] reflects isomor-

phisms.
+	3	3

The class ST 2 does not satisfy the two-out-of-three axiom but is invariant by retract. The class ST 3 does satisfy the two-out-of-three axiom but is probably not invariant by retract. So none of the definitions above allows to
describe the isomorphisms of Iglcell[ST −1]. The situation can be summarized

Second application:	a long exact sequence for the branching homology
The category of flows is a simplicial model category [3] in the following sense:
Definition 7.1 [15,12,11] x A simplicial model category is a model category C together with a simplicial set Map(X, Y ) for any object X and Y of C satisfying the following axioms:
the set Map(X, Y )0 is canonically isomorphic to C(X, Y )
for any object X, Y and Z, there is a morphism of simplicial sets Map(Y, Z) × Map(X, Y ) −→ Map(X, Z)
which is associative


for any object X of C and any simplicial set K, there exists an object X ⊗ K of C such that there exists a natural isomorphism of simplicial sets
Map(X ⊗ K, Y ) ∼= Map(K, Map(X, Y ))
for any object X of C and any simplicial set K, there exists an object
XK such that there exists a natural isomorphism of simplicial sets Map(X, Y K) ∼= Map(K, Map(X, Y ))
for any cofibration i : A −→ B and any fibration p : X −→ Y of C, the morphism of simplicial sets

Q(i, p) : Map(B, X) −→ Map(A, X) ×Map(A,Y ) Map(B, Y )

is a fibration of simplicial sets. Moreover if either i or p is trivial, then the fibration Q(i, p) is trivial as well.

Recall that there exists a pair of adjoint functors |−| : SSet « Top : S∗ where | − | is the geometric realization functor and S∗ the singular nerve functor. The n-simplex of SSet is denoted by ∆[n]. Its boundary is denoted by ∂∆[n − 1]. Let ∆n be the n-dimensional simplex.
The category of compactly generated topological spaces Top is a simplicial model category by setting Map(X, Y )n := Top(X ×∆n,Y ), X ⊗K := X ×|K| and XK := TOP(|K|,X). The category of simplicial sets SSet is a simplicial model category as well by setting Map(X, Y )n := Top(X ×∆[n],Y ), X ⊗K := X × K and XK := Map(K, X) [15].
This means that the model category of flows can be enriched over the category of simplicial sets and that the enrichment is compatible with the model structure in the sense of Definition 7.1. The symbol ∆n is the simplicial set corresponding to the n-dimensional simplex.
Because of the existence of this enrichment, there exist explicit formulae for homotopy colimits [11]. In particular, the homotopy pushout of a diagram of flows looks as follows:
Definition 7.2 [11] The homotopy pushout of the diagram of flows

is the colimit of the diagram of flows

It is then very easy to prove the:

holim hoP−(X) and hoP−(holim X) are homotopy equivalent (they are both

commutes with homotopy pushouts.

one can easily deduce a long exact sequence for the branching homology.
Definition 7.6 [3] Let X be a flow. Then the (n + 1)st branching homol-

ogy group H−
is defined as the nst homology group of the augmented

simplicial set N −(X) defined as follows:
N −(X) = Sn(hoP− X) for n ≥ 0
N − (X) = X0
the augmentation map ϵ : S0(hoP− X) −→ X0 is induced by the mapping
γ '→ s(γ) from hoP− X = S0(hoP− X) to X0.

equivalence. The functor X '→ H0(hoP− X) is only invariant up to weak S- The functors X '→ H−(X) for n ≥ 0 are invariant up to 2-dihomotopy homotopy equivalence. So the long exact sequence above is not satisfactory.
It still remains to find an exact sequence whose each term would be a functor invariant up to 2-dihomotopy equivalence.
