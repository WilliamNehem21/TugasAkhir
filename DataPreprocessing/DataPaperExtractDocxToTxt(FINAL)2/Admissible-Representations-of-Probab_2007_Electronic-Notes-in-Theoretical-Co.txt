Abstract
In a recent paper, probabilistic processes are used to generate Borel probability measures on topo- logical spaces X that are equipped with a representation in the sense of Type-2 Theory of Effectivity. This gives rise to a natural representation of the set M(X) of Borel probability measures on X. We compare this representation to a canonically constructed representation which encodes a Borel probability measure as a lower semicontinuous function from the open sets to the unit interval. This canonical representation turns out to be admissible with respect to the weak topology on M(X). Moreover, we prove that for countably based topological spaces X the representation via proba- bilistic processes is equivalent to the canonical representation and thus admissible with respect to the weak topology on M(X).

Introduction
Measures are the traditional tool in mathematics for assigning weights to the subsets of a topological space X (cf. [1,2,3,4]). They have to fulfil certain well- behavedness conditions like modularity (requiring μ(A)+ μ(B)= μ(A ∪ B)+ μ(A ∩ B)). A well-known topology on the set of measures is the weak topology, which is closely related to integration with respect to measures. The existence of a reasonable topology is indispensable for a space to be able to be handled by the Type 2 Theory of Effectivity (TTE). In this paper we study Borel

measures over qcb-spaces (which are topological spaces that are quotients of countably-based spaces) and discuss how they can be dealt with in TTE.
The general idea of the Type-2 Theory of Effectivity ([12]) for computing on non-discrete spaces, like the real numbers, is to endow any given space with a suitable representation. A representation equips the elements of the represented space with names which are infinite words over some alphabet Σ. The actual computation is performed on these names. The property of ad- missibility is introduced to guarantee that representations induce a reasonable notion of computability on the represented space (cf. Subsection 2.1).
We investigate two representations for the space of Borel probability mea- sures over a represented topological space X. Both are derived from the orig- inal representation of X. The first representation, which we call the canonical representation, is obtained by using established construction schemes for rep- resentations: a Borel probabilitistic measure on X is uniquely determined by its values on the opens of X and this restriction is a lower semicontinuous function. So Borel probabilistic measures can be represented via a canonical function space representation for lower semicontinuous functions (cf. Subsec- tion 3.1). The second representation is based on the notions of probabilistic process and probabilistic name introduced in [9]. The idea is to probabilisti- cally generate an element x of X by probabilistically producing, via a sequence of independent choices, an infinite word representing x. This sequence can be encoded as elements of Σω, leading to our second representation (cf. Subsec- tion 3.2).
We prove in Section 3 that the canonical representation is admissible w.r.t. the weak topology on the set of Borel probability measures. Moreover, we characterise the canonical representation (up to computable equivalence) as
≤cp-complete in the class of representations admitting computability of in- tegration w.r.t. Borel measures. This generalises a corresponding result by
K. Weihrauch ([11]) for the unit interval. In Section 4 we prove our main result stating that for countably based T0-spaces the canonical representation and the representation via probabilistic names are equivalent. This implies that the representation via probabilistic names is admissible w.r.t. the weak topology too. Beforehand, we give in Section 2 some background from Type-2 Theory and from Measure Theory.

Preliminaries
Throughout the paper, we assume Σ to be a finite alphabet containing the symbols 0, 1. We denote the set of finite words over Σ by Σ∗, the set of words of length n by Σn and the set {p | p : N → Σ} of infinite words by Σω. We

write ± for the reflexive prefix relation on Σ∗ ∪ Σω. For a word w ∈ Σ∗ and a subset W ⊆ Σ∗ we denote by wΣω the set {p ∈ Σω | w ± p}, by W Σω the set
w∈W wΣω and by lg(w) the length of w.
We denote the topology of a topological space X by O(X) and its under- lying set by the symbol X as well. The set of continuous functions from X to another topological space Y is denoted by C(X, Y ). On Σω we consider the Cantor topology O(Σω) := {W Σω | W ⊆ Σ∗}.
We define a transitive relation « on the real numbers by a « b :⇐⇒ a < b ∨ a = b = 0. The set of dyadic rational numbers is denoted by D.

Background from Type-2 Theory
We recall some definitions and facts from Type-2 Theory of Effectivity (TTE). More details can be found in [12,8].
The basic idea of TTE is to represent infinite objects like real numbers, functions or sets by infinite words over some alphabet Σ. The corresponding partial surjective function δ :⊆ Σω → X is called a representation of set X.
Given two representations δ :⊆ Σω → X and γ :⊆ Σω → Y , a total function f : X → Y is called (δ, γ)-computable or relative computable w.r.t. δ and γ, if there is a Type-2-computable function g :⊆ Σω → Σω realising g, which means γ(g(p)) = f (δ(p)) for all p ∈ dom(δ), where dom(δ) denotes the domain of δ. If there are ambient representations of X and Y , then we simply say that f is computable rather than f is (δ, γ)-computable. The function f is called (δ, γ)-continuous, if there is a continuous function g realising f
w.r.t. δ and γ. Relative computability and relative continuity for multivariate functions are defined similarly.
Given a representation δ' of a superset X' of X, δ is called computably reducible to δ' (in symbols δ ≤cp δ'), if the embedding of X into X' is (δ, δ')- computable. We say that δ and δ' are computable equivalent, in symbols δ ≡cp δ', if δ ≤cp δ' ≤cp δ. Topological reducibility and topological equivalence are defined analogously and denoted by, respectively, ≤t and ≡t. Note that computably (topologically) equivalent representations induce the same class of relatively computable (continuous) functions.
The property of admissibility is defined to reconcile relative continuity with mathematical continuity. We call γ :⊆ Σω → Y admissible w.r.t. a topology τY on Y , if γ is continuous w.r.t. this topology and every continuous repre- sentation φ :⊆ Σω → Y satisfies φ ≤t γ. If γ is admissible w.r.t. τY , then a total function is (δ, γ)-continuous if and only if it is continuous w.r.t. to the quotient topology τδ := U ⊆ X ∃V ∈ O(Σω).V ∩ dom(δ) = δ−1[U ] on X and τY (cf. [7]). From [12] we obtain canonical constructions of a representa-

tion [δ, γ] of X × Y and a representation [δ → γ] of the set of (δ, γ)-continuous total functions. Both constructions preserve admissibility.
The category of sequential topological spaces having an admissible rep- resentation is known to be equal to the category QCB0 of T0-quotients of countably based spaces (qcb0-spaces). Importantly, QCB0 is cartesian closed. We equip the unit interval I = [0, 1] with two representations QI= and QI< .
They are the restriction to I of the respective representations of R from [12,
Definition 4.1.3]. The first one is admissible w.r.t. the Euclidean topology O(I=) and the second one is admissible w.r.t. the lower topology O(I<) := (x, 1], [0, 1], ∅ x ∈ [0, 1) on I. As the ambient representation of Σ∗, we will use QΣ∗ :⊆ Σω → Σ∗ defined by QΣ∗ (0a10 ... 0ak11 ... ) := a1 ... ak, which is admissible w.r.t. the discrete topology on Σ∗.
Background from Measure Theory
Let X be a set. A lattice over X is a collection of subsets of X which contains the empty set and is closed under finite intersections and finite unions. An algebra over X is a lattice over X containing X and closed under complement, whereas a σ-algebra over X is an algebra that is closed under countable unions and countable intersections.
A (probabilistic) valuation ν on a lattice is a function from the lattice into the unit interval I = [0, 1] which is strict (i.e. ν(∅) = 0), monotone, modular (i.e. ν(U )+ ν(V ) = ν(U ∪ V )+ ν(U ∩ V )) and probabilistic (i.e. ν(X) = 1). In this paper we are only interested in probabilistic valuations and measures. Therefore we will omit the adjective “probabilistic” in the following. Usually, one allows the weight of X to be any number in [0, ∞]. A measure on a σ-algebra A is a valuation μ on A that is σ-additive, i.e. μ( i∈N Ai)=  i∈N μ(Ai) for every pairwise disjoint sequence (Ai)i in A.
Given a topological space X, we are mainly interested in Borel measures.
Borel measures are measures defined on the smallest σ-algebra B(X) contain- ing O(X). The elements of B(X) are called the Borel sets of X. We denote the set of Borel probabilistic measures on X by M(X). By σ-additivity, any
Borel measure on X restricts to a ω-continuous valuation on O(X). A valu-

ation ν : O(X) → I is called ω-continuous, if ν( 

i∈N
Ui)= sup

n∈N
n i=0
Ui)

holds for every sequence (Ui)i∈N of opens. This continuity notion is equivalent
to topological continuity w.r.t. the ω-Scott topology on the lattice of opens (cf. [10]) and the lower topology O(I<) = (x, 1], [0, 1], ∅ x ∈ [0, 1) on the unit interval.
Every Borel measure μ ∈ M(X) induces an outer measure μ∗ : 2X → I de- fined by μ∗(M) := inf μ(B) B ∈ B(X), B ⊇ M . Subsets M ⊆ X satisfy- ing μ∗(M)+μ∗(X \M) = 1 are called μ-measurable. Measurability of M w.r.t.

μ is equivalent to the existence of Borels sets C, D satisfying C ⊆ M ⊆ D and μ(C)= μ(D). The outer measure μ∗ restricts to a measure on the σ-algebra of μ-measurable sets. A subset M ⊆ X is called universally measurable, if M is ν-measurable for all Borel measures ν : B(X) → I. Obviously, all Borel sets are universally measurable.

Representions for Borel Measures
Let X be a sequential topological space with admissible representation δ. We equip the set M(X) of Borel measures on X with two representation, the first one is obtained by standard constructions of representations, the second one is based on probabilistic processes.
The canonical representation
Any Borel measure μ : B(X) → I restricts to a valuation μ|O(X) on the lattice of opens of X, which is continuous with respect to the ω-Scott topol- ogy 2 O2(X) on O(X) and the lower topology on I, because by σ-additivity μ(  i∈N Oi) = supi∈N μ(Oi) holds for any increasing sequence (Oi)i of open
sets. This opens up the possibility to represent Borel measures via a canoni-
cal function space representation of C(O(X), I<).
A canonical representation of O(X) which is admissible w.r.t. the ω-Scott topology is constructed by
δ⊕(q)= U :⇐⇒ [δ → QI< ](p)= cf U ,
where cf U : X → I< denotes the characteristic function of U (mapping the elements of U to 1 and the elements of X \ U to 0). Since any Borel measure is uniquely determined by its restriction to O(X) and this restriction is lower semicontinuous, we can define a representation δMC of M(X) by
δMC (p)= μ  :⇐⇒ [δ⊕ → QI< ](p)= μ|O(X) .
We call δMC the canonical representation of M(X). From [12, Ex. 3.3.7] we conclude:
Proposition 3.1 The operator γ '→ γMC preserves computable as well as topological equivalence of representations.
The canoncial representation δMC is admissible, because it is obtained by constructions preserving admissibility (cf. [8]). We now show that δMC is ad-

2 The ω-Scott topology O2(X) on O(X) is defined as the family of all subsets H ⊆ O(X) such that U ∈ H and U ⊆ V ∈ O(X) imply V ∈ H and n∈N Un ∈ H implies ∃n. Un ∈ H for any increasing sequence (Un)n of opens.

missible w.r.t. the weak topology on M(X). The weak topology τw on M(X) is defined as the weakest topology such that, for all lower semicontinuous functions f : X → I<, the function μ '→ f dμ is lower semicontinuous. In- tegration of a lower semicontinuous function f w.r.t. to a Borel measure μ is defined by the Riemann integral

∫ fdμ :=

0

= sup  Σ	}
k
(ai − ai−1) · μ(f −1(ai, ∞]) 0= a0 < a1 < ... < ak ≤ 1 .
i=1
Note that the mapping t '→ μ({x ∈ X | f (x) > t}) is Riemann-integrable by being decreasing and right-continuous (cf. [1]). This horizontal integral is monotone and satisfies  f dμ +  g dμ = 2 (f + g)/2 dμ (cf. [6]).
The following characterisation of the weak topology, which we formulate for bases of hereditarily Lindelo¨f spaces, belongs to the folklore of measure theory.
Lemma 3.2 Let X be a hereditarily Lindelo¨f space and B be a base of X closed under ﬁnite union. Then the family D of sets μ ∈ M(X) μ(B) > q , where B ∈B and q ∈ Q, is a subbase of the weak topology on X.
Proof. Since we have  cf U dμ = μ(U ) for all μ ∈ M(X) and U ∈ O(X), every element of the family D is contained in the weak topology.
Let f ∈ C(X, I<) and μ ∈ M(X). For any rational number z < f dμ, there are k ≥ 1 and rational numbers 0 = a0 < a1 < ... < ak ≤ 1, b1,... , bk
with μ(f −1(ai, 1]) > bi and Σk  (ai − ai−1) · bi ≥ z. Since X is hereditarily
Lindel¨of, the open set f −1(ai, 1] is a countable union of elements in B, hence
by continuity of μ there is some Bi ∈B with Bi ⊆ f −1(ai, 1] and μ(Bi) > bi. It
follows ∫ f dν > z for all Borel measures ν ∈  k	 η ∈ M(X) η(Bi) > bi}. 
With the help of this lemma, we show that δMC is admissible w.r.t. to the weak topology on M(X).
Theorem 3.3 Let δ be an admissible representation of a sequential space X. Then δMC is admissible w.r.t. the weak topology on M(X).
For the proof, we need the following proposition about admissibility of the canonical function space representation [δ → γ]. It follows from Lemma 4.2.2 and Proposition 4.2.5 in [8].
Proposition 3.4 Let δ and γ be admissible representations of sequential spaces X and Y , respectively. Then [δ → γ] is admissible w.r.t. to the simple topology on the set C(X, Y ) of continuous functions between X and Y which

has as its subbase the family of sets	f ∈ C(X, Y ) ∀n ≤ ∞.f (xn) ∈ V , where (xn)n≤∞ is a convergent sequence of X and V ∈ O(Y ).
Proof of Theorem 3.3: At first we show that δ⊕ is indeed admissible w.r.t. the ω-Scott topology. From Proposition 3.4 it follows that δ⊕ is admissible
w.r.t. the topology τ1 on O(X) which has as its subbase the family of all sets of the form
 U ∈ O(X) {x∞, xn | n ∈ N}⊆ U  ,
where (xn)n is a sequence converging in X to some x∞ ∈ X.
Let H be an ω-Scott open set and let (Un)n be a sequence of opens con- verging with respect to τ1 to some element U∞ ∈ H. It is not difficult to verify
that for any m ∈ N the set U ' :=	Uj ∩ U∞ is sequentially open (and
m	j≥m
'

H is ω-Scott open, there is some m0 ∈ N with U '
∈ H implying Un ∈ H

for every n ≥ m0, because U '
⊆ Un. Hence (Un)n converges to U∞ w.r.t.

the ω-Scott topology. Since conversely the ω-Scott topology contains τ1, it induces the same convergence relation on O(X) as τ1. Thus δ⊕ is admissible
w.r.t. the ω-Scott topology as well. Note that the ω-Scott topology is known to be sequential, thus it is equal to the final topology of δ⊕ by [7, Theorem 7].
By Proposition 3.4, δMC is admissible w.r.t. the topology τ2 on M(X) that has as a subbase the family of all sets of the form
B(Un),z :=	ν ∈ M(X) ∀n ≤ ∞. ν(Un) > z  ,
where z ∈ R and (Un)n is a sequence of opens that converges w.r.t. the ω-Scott
topology to some U∞ ∈ O(X). Clearly, τ2 contains the weak topology as a subset. To show that the converse holds as well, let μ ∈ B(Un),z. As mentioned

above, the sets U '
:= 
j≥m
Uj ∩ U∞ are open and satisfy U∞ = 
m∈N
U ' .

Since μ|O(m) is continuous, there is some m0 ∈ N with μ(U '
) > z. Obviously

μ ∈  ν ∈ M(X) ν(U '
) > z  ∩
i<m0
 ν ∈ M(X) ν(Ui) > z} ⊆ B(Un
),z .

Thus B(Un),z belongs to the weak topology, implying that the weak topology is equal to τ2. Therefore δMC is admissible w.r.t. the weak topology.	 
We do not know whether the weak topology on M(X) is sequential, which would imply that the weak topology is equal to the final topology of the canon- ical representation. However, for countably based spaces X the weak topology on M(X) is countably based by virtue of Lemma 3.2 and thus sequential. We obtain by [7, Theorem 7]:
Corollary 3.5 For every admissible representation δ of a countably based space X the ﬁnal topology of δMC is equal to the weak topology on M(X).

The canonical representation δMC turns out to be ≤cp-complete in the set of all representations γ of M(X) that admit computability of horizontal integration. This generalises the corresponding result by K. Weihrauch for the unit interval (cf. [11, Theorem 2.6]).
Proposition 3.6 Let γ be a representation of a subset M of M(X).
The integral operator  : C(X, I<) ×M → I< is ([δ → QI< ], γ, QI< )-com- putable if and only if γ ≤cp δMC .
The integral operator  : C(X, I<) ×M → I< is ([δ → QI< ], γ, QI< )-con- tinuous if and only if γ ≤t δMC .
Proof. We only show (i), the proof of (ii) is similar.
“⇐=”: It suffices to consider the case γ = δMC . Let f := [δ → QI< ](p) and μ := δMC (q). For any rational number z <  f dμ, there are k ≥ 1 and rational numbers 0 = a0 < a1 < ... < ak ≤ 1, b1,... , bk with μ(f −1(ai, 1]) > bi and

k i=1
(ai − ai−1) · bi ≥ z. From the name p and any rational number a we can

compute a δ⊕-name r of the open set f −1(a, 1]) and then from the names q
and r some QI< -name s of μ(f −1(a, 1]). This name s effectively encodes a list of rationals below μ(f −1(a, 1]). Therefore we can effectively produce a list of rationals below f dμ and hence QI< -name of  f dμ. This means that  is
([δ → QI< ], δMC , QI< )-computable.
“=⇒”:	Let μ  := γ(p) and U  := δ⊕(q).	Since μ(U ) = ∫ cf U dμ∫ and
realises the function (μ, O) '→ μ(O) w.r.t. γ, δ⊕ and QI< . Hence we can compute a [δ⊕ → QI< ]-name of the valuation μ|O(X), which by definition is a δMC -name of μ.	 

The representation via probabilistic processes
We now define a representation δMN of M(X) based on probabilistic processes on infinite words. Probabilistic processes provide a natural way of generating Borel measures on represented spaces. The idea is to randomly generate an element p of Σω by performing a sequence of independent choices. If the probability of p being in the domain of the considered representation is 1, then this equates to randomly choose an element of the represented space X, see [9] for details.
Formally, a probabilistic process is a function π : Σ∗ → I satisfying
π(ϵ)= 1 and π(w)=   π(wa) for all w ∈ Σ∗ .	(2)
a∈Σ
A probabilistic process π induces a Borel measure πˆ on Σω which is defined

on the open sets of Σω by

πˆ(W Σω) :=
w∈W
π(w)	for all prefix-free sets W ⊆ Σ∗.	(3)

By Lemma 4 in [9], Equation (3) indeed determines a unique Borel measure on Σω.
Given a Borel measure μ : B(X) → I on X, we say that a probabilistic process π is a δ-probabilistic name for μ, if
μ(B)= πˆ∗(δ−1[B])  holds for every Borel set B ∈ B(X) .
Remember that πˆ∗ denotes the outer measure generated by πˆ. If additionally Σω \ dom(δ) is a πˆ-null set, i.e. πˆ∗(Σω \ dom(δ)) = 0, then π is called a strong probabilistic name for μ.
By Lemma 6 and Proposition 7 in [9], π is a δ-probabilistic name for μ if and only if for every U ∈ O(X) and V ∈ O(Σω)

V ∩ dom(δ)= δ−1[U ] implies
πˆ(V )= μ(U ) .

In particular this implies πˆ∗(dom(δ)) = 1. Conversely, if πˆ∗(dom(δ)) is equal to 1, then B '→ πˆ∗(δ−1[B]) yields a Borel measure on X. We denote by MN(X) (by MS(X)) the set of Borel measures that have an ordinary (respectively strong) δ-probabilistic name. Note that both sets MN(X) and MS(X) are independent of the choice of the admissible representation δ by [9, Corollary 12]. It is not known whether every Borel measure on any admissibly repre- sentable space has a probabilistic name. However, if X is countably based or, more generally, if X has a countable pseudobase consisting of universally measurable sets, then MN(X) is equal to M(X) by [9, Proposition 13]. By the following lemma, MS(X) is not necessarily equal to MN(X).
Lemma 3.7 A subspace Y of Σω satisﬁes MS(Y )= MN(Y ) if and only if Y
is a universally measurable subset of Σω.
Proof. We define γ :⊆ Σω → Y defined by dom(γ) = Y and γ(p) = p. Obviously, γ is an admissible representation of Y .
Let Y be universally measurable. Any γ-probabilistic name π for a Borel measure μ on Y is simulaneously a strong γ-probabilistic name for Y , because πˆ∗(Σω \ dom(γ)) = πˆ∗(Σω \ Y )=1 − πˆ∗(Y ) = 0, as Y is πˆ-measurable. Thus MS(Y )= MN(Y ).
Now let μ be a Borel measure on Σω such that Y is not μ-measurable. Choose some Borel set G ⊆ B(Σω) with Y ⊆ G and μ∗(Y ) = μ(G). Then μ(G) > 0, because otherwise Y would be measurable by being a null-set. Obviously, ν : B(Σω) → I defined by ν(B) := μ(B ∩ G)/μ(G) is a Borel measure on Σω with ν∗(Y )= ν(Σω)= 1.
Assume ν∗(Σω \ Y ) = 0. Then there is some N ∈ B(Σω) with Σω \ Y ⊆ N

and ν(N) = 0, hence μ(N ∩ G) = 0. Since Σω \ N ⊆ Y ⊆ G and μ(Σω \ N)= 1 − μ(N)= μ(N ∪ G) − μ(N)= μ(G) − μ(N ∩ G)= μ(G), this implies that Y is μ-measurable, a contradiction.
Hence ν∗(Σω \Y )+ν∗(Y ) > 1 meaning that Y is not ν-measurable. Clearly, the function π : Σ∗ → I with π(w) := ν(wΣω) is a probabilistic process
satisfying πˆ = ν. By Lemma 6 and Theorem 8 in [9], π is a γ-probabilistic
name of the Borel measure η : B(Y ) → I defined by η(B) := πˆ∗(γ−1[B]). Since γ is injective, π is the only γ-probabilistic name of η. Hence η does not have any strong γ-probabilistic name. We conclude MS(Y ) /= MN(Y ).	 
Using the ambient representations QΣ∗ of Σ∗ and QI of I=, we define rep- resentations δMN of MN(X) and δMS of MS(X) by
δMN (p)= μ :⇐⇒ [QΣ∗ → QI ](p) is a δ-probabilistic name for μ,
δMS (p)= μ :⇐⇒ [QΣ∗ → QI ](p) is a strong δ-probabilistic name for μ. 

Trivially, δMS ≤cp δMN . If dom(δ) is universally measurable, then both repre- sentations are equal. Proposition 10 in [9] implies that both operators preserve computable equivalence of representations. With similar proofs, one can show preservation of topological equivalence.
Proposition 3.8 The operators γ '→ γMN and γ '→ γMS preserve computable as well as topological equivalence of representations.

Comparison of the Representations of Borel Mea- sures
In this section we will investigate the relationship between the canonical repre- sentation of M(X) and the representation via probabilistic names. In partic- ular, we will show that they are topologically equivalent for countably based T0-spaces.
From Theorem 16 in [9] we know that the integral operator  : C(X, I<) × MN(X) → I< is ([δ → QI< ], δMN , QI< )-computable. By Proposition 3.6 we obtain:
Proposition 4.1 Let δ be an admissible representation of a sequential space
X. Then δMN is computably reducible to δMC , i.e. δMN ≤cp δMC .
As consequence we obtain that, in the case MN(X) = M(X), the final topology of δMN is finer than (or equal to) the weak topology on M(X).

The Case of Countably Based Spaces
We now work towards showing that for countably based spaces the canonical representation and the representation via ordinary probabilistic names are topologically equivalent. The idea is to prove this equivalence at first for Scott’s graph model P. The underlying set of P is the family of all subsets of N, topologised by the Scott topology O(P) on the dcpo (P, ⊆). The family of sets ↑E := {y ∈ P | E ⊆ y}, where E is a finite subset of N, forms a base of the Scott topology on P. We equip P with a representation QP : Σω → P defined by
QP(p) :=	m ∈ N ∃i ∈ N. p⟨i, m⟩ = 1  ,
where ⟨·, ·⟩ : N2 → N denotes the computable bijection defined by ⟨a, b⟩ := b + a+b i. It is admissible: continuity of QP is obvious; for a given continuous function φ :⊆ Σω → P, the continuous function g : Σω → Σω defined by
,⎨ 1 if φ(q) ∈ ↑{b} for all q ∈ dom(φ) with ∀i ≤ a. q(i)= p(i)

g(p)(⟨a, b⟩) :=
, 0 otherwise

translates φ into QP.
The space P is known to be universal for the class of countably based T0- spaces in the sense that each of them is isomorphic to some subspace of P. Given a numbering β : N → B of a countable subbase B of X, an embedding ιβ : X → P can be defined by ιβ(x) := {i ∈ N | x ∈ β(i)}. This embedding leads to a representation δβ := ι−1 ◦ QP of X which can easily be verified to be admissible w.r.t. the topology of X. A representation of X constructed in this way is called a standard representation of X.
For the the proof of QMC ≤cp QMN we need the following Splitting Lemma
(cf. [3]), which we formulate for rational numbers rather than real numbers.

Lemma 4.2 (Splitting Lemma) Let (ra)a∈A and (sb)b∈B be two ﬁnite se- quences of non-negative rational numbers and Z ⊆ A × B be a relation such that, for all I ⊆ A,
ri ≤	{sj | ∃i ∈ I. (i, j) ∈ Z} .	(4)
i∈I
Then one can compute non-negative rationals (ti,j)(i,j)∈Z satisfying

(a,Σj)∈Z
ta,j = ra	and
(i,b)∈Z
ti,b ≤ sb	(5)

for all a ∈ A and b ∈ B. The algorithm produces dyadic rationals, if the input consists of dyadic rationals.

Proof. [Sketch] This Splitting Lemma follows from the computable Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem, see [5] for details. Assuming that A, B and {⊥, T} are disjoint, one considers the directed graph which has A∪B ∪{⊥, T} as its set of vertices and E := ({⊥} × A) ∪ Z ∪ (B × {T}) as its set of edges. The capacity assigned to an edge (⊥, a) is va, to an edge (a, b) ∈ Z is ∞, and to an edge (b, T) is sb. Condition (4) ensures that the minimal cut of this graph (with ⊥ being the source and T being the sink) is  a∈A va. By the computable Max- Flow Min-Cut Theorem one can compute a feasible flow t : E → Q ∩ [0, ∞) through the graph with maximal value a∈A va. The numbers (t(i, j))(i,j)∈Z are easily verified to satisfy Condition (5).	 

Proposition 4.3 The representations QMN , QMS
and QMC
are computably

equivalent.

Given a name p of a Borel measure μ = QMC (p) under the canonical repre- sentation, we construct at first for every n ∈ N a valuation νn on the smallest algebra An on P containing ↑{0},..., ↑{n} such that 3
νn(B) ≤ νn+1(B) « μ(B)	and	sup νn(B)= μ(B)	(6)
i≥n

holds for every open set B ∈ Bn := An ∩ O(P). From the sequence (νn)n we then compute a probabilistic process πp : Σ∗ → D ∩ I satisfying
νk(B)= Σ πp(u) u ∈ Σl(k) and ↑(u+) ⊆ B}	(7) for all B ∈ Bk, where l(k) := Σk+1 i and
u+ := QP(u0ω)=  m ∈ N ∃i ∈ N.(⟨i, m⟩ < lg(u), u⟨i, m⟩ = 1)} .
This probabilistic process πp turns out to be a QP-probabilistic name for μ.
Note that l is chosen in such a way that for all F ⊆ {0,... ,k + 1} there is exactly one word w ∈ Σk+2 such that for all u ∈ Σl(k) we have uw ∈ Σl(k+1) and (uw)+ = u+ ∪ F . This enables us to construct πp in such a way that Property (7) is satisfied. The algebra An is obtained by closing the family Cn := Cn F ⊆ {0,..., n} of prime crescents

Cn :=

i∈{0,...,n}\F

under finite union.


Construction of the valuations νn

In order to construct the valuations νn, we at first compute from the in- put name p of the Borel measure μ for every open B ∈ n∈N Bn a sequence (dB,n)n∈N of dyadic rationals approximating μ(B) from below, i.e. (dB,n)n∈N satisfies

0 ≤ dB,n ≤ dB,n+1 « μ(B)	and	sup dB,i = μ(B) .	(8)
i∈N

We sketch how this can be achieved: Given some v ∈ dom(QP), we can semi-decide QP(v) ∈ B by searching a prefix w of v satisfying ↑(w+) ⊆ B. This

implies that we can produce a [QP → QI<
]-name of B. The QMC -name p allows

us the computation of a QI< -name of μ(B). The latter codes a sequence (vB,n)n
of rationals converging to μ(B) from below. From (vB,n)n we can extract in a computable way a sequence (dB,n)n with the required properties. Note that (dB,n)B,n depends on the name p, not only on the valuation μ encoded by p.
From (dB,n)B,n, we construct the sequence (νn)n recursively as follows. “n = 0”: We set ν0(↑{0}) := d↑{i},0 and ν0(P \ ↑{i}) := 1 − ν0(↑{i}).
“n → n + 1”: We construct νn+1 from νn by searching a finite function q :
Cn+1 → D and a number m ≥ n + 1 satisfying
dB,n+1 ≤ Σ{q(C) | C ∈ Cn+1, C ⊆ B}≤ dB,m for all B ∈ Bn+1,
νn(B) ≤ Σ{q(C) | C ∈ Cn+1, C ⊆ B} for all B ∈ Bn and

C∈Cn+1 q(C)= 1
and by setting νn+1(M) :=
Σ{q(C) | C ∈ Cn+1, C ⊆ M} for M ∈ An+1. Note

that Conditions (a) and (b) imply Property (6), whereas Condition (c) ensures that νn+1 is probabilistic.
To show that such a pair (q, m) exists, choose a number t ∈ (0, 1) satisfying
dB,n+1 ≤ t · μ(B) for all B ∈ Bn+1 and νn(B) ≤ t · μ(B) for all B ∈ Bn. For every prime crescent C ∈ Cn+1 \ {Cn+1} we choose a dyadic rational number

) and set	∅

for all B ∈ Bn+1. Since Bn+1 is finite and supi∈N dB,i = μ(B), there is some m
satisfying (a).

Construction of the probabilistic process πp
We construct πp recursively and define in step k the values πp(w) for words w
with l(k − 1) < lg(w) ≤ l(k).
“k = 0”: Obviously, Σl(0) = {1, 0}, C0 = ↑{0}, P\↑{0} and A0 = {∅, P}∪C0.
We set πp(1) := ν0(↑{0}), πp(0) := 1 − πp(1) and πp(ϵ) := 1.
“k → k + 1”: In order to apply the Splitting Lemma, we define a relation Z ⊆ Σl(k) × Ck+1 by (u, C) ∈ Z :⇐⇒ ↑(u+) ⊇ C and set vu := πp(u) and sC := νk+1(C). Let I ⊆ Σl(k). Since B :=  ↑(u+) u ∈ I  ∈ Bn, we obtain

Σu∈I
v ≤	π (u) u ∈ Σl(k) , ↑(u+) ⊆ B	= ν (B)
≤ νk+ 1(B)= Σ  νk+1(C) C ∈ Ck+1, C ⊆ B}}

= Σ  νk+1(C) C ∈ Ck+1, ∃u ∈ I. C ⊆ ↑(u+)
= Σ sC ∃u ∈ I. (u, C) ∈ Z} .
By the Splitting Lemma 4.2, we can compute dyadic rationals (tu,C)(u,C)∈7 such that

(u,ΣD)∈7
tu,D = πp(u)	and
(v,C)∈7
tv,C ≤ νk+1(C)	(9)

for all u ∈ Σl(k) and C ∈ Ck+1. Since


= Σ  Σ


(u,C)∈7
tu,C u ∈ Σl(k)} = Σ{πp(u) | u ∈ Σl(k)} = 1 ,



we have even


(v,ΣC)∈7


tv,C = νk+1(C)	for all C ∈ Ck+1.	(10)

Using w⊕ := {i < lg(w) | w(i)= 1}, we define πp on Σl(k+1) unambiguously
by
,,⎨ tu,Ck+1 if u+ ⊆ w⊕

πp(uw) :=
,,
0	otherwise

for u ∈ Σl(k) and w ∈ Σk+2. Moreover, for words v with l(k) < lg(v) < l(k +1) we set
πp(v) := Σ πp(vw) vw ∈ Σl(k+1)} .

For u ∈ Σl(k) and w ∈ Σk+2 we have u+ ⊆ w⊕ ⇐⇒ (u, Ck+1) ∈ Z, uw ∈
Σl(k+1) and (uw)+ = u+ ∪ w⊕. Equation (9) yields
πp(u)= Σ tu,C (u, C) ∈ Z} = Σ tu,Ck+1 w ∈ Σ	, u	⊆ w

Σ	}	Σ	}
=	πp(uw) w ∈ Σk+2, u+ ⊆ w⊕	=	πp(uw) w ∈ Σk+2
= Σ πp(uw) uw ∈ Σl(k+1)} .
This implies πp(v)=	a∈Σ πp(va) for all words v with lg(v) < l(k + 1), hence
πp is a probabilistic process.
For every prime crescent C ∈ Ck+1 there is exactly one word xC ∈ Σk+2 with C = Ck+1. We obtain by Equation (10)
C
νk+1(C)= Σ  tu,C  (u, C) ∈ Z} = Σ  πp(uxC) u ∈ Σl(k), u+ ⊆ x⊕}

= Σ π (v) v ∈ Σl(k+1), v+ = x⊕} = Σ π (v) v ∈ Σl(k+1), Ck+1 = C} .
Hence

= Σ π (v) v ∈ Σl(k+1), Ck+1 ⊆ B} = Σ π (v) v ∈ Σl(k+1), ↑(v+) ⊆ B
for all B ∈ Bk+1, guaranteeing Equation (7).


Proof of πp being a probabilistic name for μ
Let U ∈ O(X) and V  := Q−1[U ].	For
}		 

n ∈ N let Un :=   ↑F F ⊆

{0,... , n}, ↑F  ⊆ U , Vn  :=   wΣω w ∈ Σl(n), ↑(w+) ⊆ U }.	and
πˆp(V )= supn∈N πˆp(Vn). By (7) we have
ν (U )=	 π (w) w ∈ Σl(n), ↑(w+) ⊆ U }
= Σ πp(w) w ∈ Σl(n), ↑(w+) ⊆ U } = πˆp(Vn) .
Hence πˆp(Vn) ≤ μ(Un) ≤ μ(U ) implying πˆp(V ) ≤ μ(U ). Now let ε > 0. Since μ|O(X) is a continuous valuation, there is some m ∈ N such that μ(Um) ≥ μ(U ) − ε/2. By (6) there is some n ≥ m with νn(Um) > μ(Um) − ε/2. Hence
πˆp(V ) ≥ πˆp(Vn)= νn(Un) ≥ νn(Um) ≥ μ(U ) − ε. 
We conclude πˆp(V )= μ(U ). Therefore πp is QP-probabilistic name for μ.

Computability of p '→ πp
The function (p, w) '→ πp(w) is computable, because πp(w) only depends on finitely many values of the sequences (dB,n)B,n and (νn)n, which are com- putable in p, B, n. Hence there is a computable function g :⊆ Σω → Σω with πp = [QΣ∗ → QI< ](g(p)). Since πp is a probablistic name of μ = QP  (p), g
translates QMC into QMN . This concludes the proof of QMC ≤cp QMN .	 
For transferring the equivalence result from P to arbitrary countably based spaces, we need the property that a probabilistic names π for a measure μ satisfies μ∗(M)= πˆ∗(Q−1[M]) for all subsets M of P, not only for Borel sets.
Lemma 4.4 Let π : Σ∗ → I be a QP-probabilistic name for a Borel measure μ
on P. Then μ∗(M)= πˆ∗(Q−1[M]) for all M ⊆ P.
Proof. Let M ⊆ P. There are Borel sets A ∈ B(P) and B ∈ B(Σω) with
M ⊆ A, μ(A)= μ∗(M), Q−1[M] ⊆ B and πˆ(B)= πˆ∗(Q−1[M]). The graph of
P	P
QP is a Borel set of Σω × P, because
Graph(QP)=   Q−1[↑{i}] × ↑{i} ∪ Q−1[P \ ↑{i}] × (P \ ↑{i}) .


Hence the set
P	P
i∈N

QP[Σω \ B]= x ∈ P ∃p ∈ Σω. (p, x) ∈ Graph(QP) ∩ (Σω \ B) × P
is the projection of a Borel set of Σω × P onto P. Since Σω is a separable complete metric space, QP[Σω \B] is a universally measurable subset of P by [1, Proposition 8.4.4]. Thus there are Borel sets C, D ∈ P with C ⊆ QP[Σω \ B] ⊆ D and μ(C)= μ(D). Since M ⊆ P \ QP[Σω \ B] and Q−1[P \ D] ⊆ B, it follows
μ∗(M) ≤ μ∗(P \ QP[Σω \ B]) ≤ μ(P \ C)= μ(P \ D)= πˆ∗(Q−1[P \ D])
≤ πˆ(B)= πˆ∗(Q−1[M]) ≤ πˆ∗(Q−1[A]) = μ(A)= μ∗(M) ,
P	P
hence μ∗(M)= πˆ∗(Q−1[M]).	 
Now we are ready to prove:
Theorem 4.5 For a standard representation δβ of a countably based F0-space
X, the representations δMN and δMC are computably equivalent.
Proof. From Proposition 4.1 we already know δMN ≤cp δMC .
β	β
Let μ : B(X) → I be a Borel measure on X. Then μˆ : B(P) → I defined by
μ˜(D) := μ(ι−1[D]) is a Borel measure on P. We show that any QP-probabilistic name π for μ˜ is simultaneously a δβ-probabilistic name for μ. Let B ∈ B(P).

There is some Borel set B# ∈ B(P) with B = ι−1[B#]. We calculate
μ˜∗(ι [B]) = inf μ˜(D) D ∈ B(P), D ⊇ ι [B]
= inf  μ(ι−1[D]) D ∈ B(P), D ⊇ ιβ[B]
≥ μ(B)= μ˜(B#) ≥ μ˜∗(ιβ[B]) .
By Lemma 4.4 we obtain πˆ∗(δ−1[B]) = πˆ∗(Q−1[ιβ[B]]) = μ˜∗(ιβ[B]) = μ(B).
β	P
Therefore π is a δβ-probabilistic name for μ.
We conclude that any QMN -name q ∈ Σω of μ˜ is also a δMN -name of
μ. On the other hand, it is easy to see that any δMC -name p ∈ Σω of μ is simultaneously a QMC -name of μ˜. Therefore the translator from QMC into QMN
P	P	P
provided by Proposition 4.3 also translates δMC into δMN .	 
β	β
Note that by Lemma 3.7 the representation δMS need not be equivalent to
δMN . We obtain by Propositions 3.1 and 3.8:
Theorem 4.6 For any admissible representation δ of a countably based F0- space X, the canonical representation δMC of the Borel measures on X and the representation δMN via probabilistic names are topologically equivalent.
The function translating δMC into δMN produces probabilistic names with dyadic rational weights. Thus it would be sufficient to define probabilistic processes as a function π from Σ∗ to I ∩ D satisfying Equation (2). One can show that under this definition MN(X)= M(X) remains true for all admissi- bly representable spaces X which have a pseudobase consisting of universally measurable sets.
Theorems 4.6, 3.3 and Corollary 3.5 yield:
Theorem 4.7 For any admissible representation δ of a countably based F0- space X, the representation δMN via probabilistic name is admissible w.r.t. the weak topology on M(X). The ﬁnal topology of δMN is equal to the weak topology.
The signed-digit representation Qsd of the reals as well as the representation QI= of the unit interval are computably equivalent to a respective standard representation (cf. [12]). By Theorem 4.5 along with Propositions 3.1 and 3.8
this implies QMC ≡cp QMN and QMC ≡cp QMN . Thus the representation QMN via

sd	sd
I=	I=	I=

probabilistic names of the Borel measures on the unit interval is computably
equivalent to the representation considered in [11], because both are ≤cp- complete in the set of representations of M(I=) admitting computability of integration.

Discussion
We have shown that probabilistic names induce a representation for Borel measures which, in the case of countably based F0-spaces, is admissible w.r.t. the familiar weak topology. This question had remained unsolved in the pre- ceding paper [9]. Therefore the representation via probabilistic names is very natural, justifying the concept of probabilistic names as generators of Borel measures. An open problem is to characterise the class of non countably based qcb0-spaces for which the representation via probabilistic names is admissible
w.r.t. the weak topology.
