Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is an effective regulator of glucose and lipid metabolism. It is mainly regulated by peroxisome proliferator activated receptors, and is widely associated with cases of insulin resistance as obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Our study aimed to investigate thepotentialeffects of omega-3 fatty acids, pioglitazone, andtheircombination on serum and liver FGF21 concentrations, and its hepatic gene expression in a rat model of T2D. We also studied the modulating effects of these treatments on blood glucose, lipid profile, and insulin resistance. T2D was induced in male SpragueeDawley rats by combination of high fat diet and low dose streptozotocin (35 mg/kg). Diabetic rats were treated with omega-3 fatty acids (10%W/W diet), pioglitazone (20 mg/kg), and their combination for a period of 4 weeks. Serum FGF21 concentration was significantly increased in diabetic rats. In contrast, hepatic FGF21 concentration, and gene expression were significantly decreased. Omega-3 fatty acids, pioglitazone, andtheir combination significantly decreased serum FGF21. Omega-3 fatty acids and combination therapy significantly decreased liver FGF21 concentration, with non- significant changes in gene expression. On the other hand, pioglitazone significantly increased hepatic FGF21 concentration and gene expression. Omega-3 fatty acids, pioglita- zone and their combination significantly improved lipid profile. Pioglitazone and combination significantly decreased blood glucose levels and improved insulin resistance. In conclusion, this study introduces the first evidence regarding the antidiabetic effects of omega-3 fatty acids and pioglitazone combination, such effects are mediated through FGF21.

Introduction

Diabetes prevalence is increasing at an accelerating rate approaching epidemic levels. Currently, there are 382 million
diabetic patients worldwide. In the Middle East and North Africa, 1 in 10 adults have diabetes. Egypt is one of the top 10 countries in the number of people with diabetes (7.5 million in 2013) and the number is expected to increase to 13.1 million by 2035 [1]. Diabetes is characterized by hyperglycemia resulting

from disorders in insulin secretion, insulin action or both [2]. Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a heterogeneous, progressive disorder initially characterized by glucose intolerance and compensa- tory hyperinsulinemia, which in later stages progresses to insulin resistance and impaired beta cell function [3].
Type 2 Diabetes, which accounts for 90e95% of diabetic cases, is largely caused by social and lifestyle factors that can be readily controlled [1,2]. Obesity leads to an increase in the adipose tissue mass. This in turn triggers insulin resistance in fat, skeletal muscle, and liver leading to T2D [4]. A medical approach is not always sufficient for T2D management and lifestyle modification should be considered.
Omega-3 fatty acids (u-3 fatty acids) have shown to possess
anti-inflammatory, and lipid lowering effects, suggesting a possible beneficial effect in management of T2D and its complications [5,6]. Several animal studies have shown that administration of the u-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), prevented the devel- opment of insulin resistance, obesity, and dyslipidemia [6e8]. These effects are mediated via interaction with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor a (PPAR-a) [9]. PPAR is a nuclear receptor that plays important roles in adipocyte differentia- tion, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism through transcrip-
tional regulation of different genes [10]. Other studies in T2D patients and rat models of insulin resistance showed that u-3 fatty acids failed to reverse insulin resistance [6,11e14].
Pharmacological management of T2D aims to increase in- sulin secretion or improve insulin sensitivity [15]. Pioglitazone belongs to a class of drugs named thiazolidinediones, which improve insulin sensitivity, lipid metabolism, and glucose homeostasis through activation of PPAR-ˠ [16].
Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a recently identified hormone that has an important role in glucose and lipid ho- meostasis [17e19]. Rat FGF21 is a circulating protein derived from a 208-amino acid mature protein encoded by the FGF21 gene located in chromosome 1 [20]. FGF 21 is detected in plasma, so it is proposed to be secreted into circulation acting as a true hormone. Its activity depends on binding to FGF re- ceptors (FGFR) and a cofactor called b-Klotho, a trans- membrane protein whose expression is stimulated during development of preadipocytes to adipocytes [21]. The cofactor b-Klotho is predominantly expressed in metabolic organs including liver, white adipose tissue, and pancreas [22]. FGF21 has glucose-lowering effects through several mechanisms. It stimulates glucose uptake in differentiated adipocytes via the induction of glucose transporter-1 (GLUT1) [17,23,24]. Glucose uptake induced by FGF21 is additive and independent of in- sulin. It has also been reported that FGF21 might act on glucagon metabolism, leading to decreased hepatic glucose production, and increased liver glycogen [25]. Finally, FGF21 was shown to preserve b-cell function and survival [26].
Fibroblast growth factor 21 is produced by the liver and white adipose tissue, under the influence of PPAR-a and PPAR- g respectively [27,28]. It was reported that serum FGF21 con- centration is significantly increased in case of hyper- triglyceridemia, insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome, indicating a state of FGF21 resistance [29].
Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor-g agonists have been shown to lower blood glucose, total cholesterol, and triglycerides concentrations and improve insulin resistance.
Whether these effects are mediated via modulation of hepatic FGF21 is still unclear. The aim of this study is to investigate the
potential anti-diabetic effects of combining a PPAR-a agonist (u-3 fatty acids) and a PPAR-ˠ agonist (pioglitazone), and whether these effects are mediated through modulation of
FGF21.

Materials and methods

Drugs and chemicals

Omega-3 fish oil (containing EPA 180 mg and DHA 120 mg) was purchased from Lifeplan (Lutterworth, Leicestershire, England). Pioglitazone was supplied in the form of pharma- ceutical product (Diabetin tablets, Uni Pharma co., Cairo, Egypt). Streptozotocin (STZ) was purchased from Sigma- eAldrich (St. Louis, Mo., USA). The feeding ingredients were obtained from commercial sources and were of analytical grades.

Animals

Fifty male SpragueeDawley (SD) rats weighing 150e190 g were allowed free access to food and tap water. Rats were kept under standard conditions of temperature (22 ± 2oC) and relative humidity (55 ± 5%) with 12-light/12-dark cycles. The animal care and experiments described in this study were
complied with “ Research Ethics Committee” Faculty of Pharmacy, Mansoura University, Egypt, in accordance with “ Principles of Laboratory Animal Care” (NIH publication No. 85- 23, revised 1985).

Induction of T2D

Experimental rats were maintained on a high fat diet (58% fat, 25% protein and 17% carbohydrate, as a percentage of total kcal) ad libitum. The high-fat diet (HFD) was prepared and composed as described by Srinivasan et al. (2005) [30]. After 1 month on high fat diet, experimental rats were injected intraperitoneally with freshly prepared STZ (35 mg/kg body weight) in 0.1 M citrate buffer (pH 4.5) after an overnight fasting [30]. Control rats were injected with citrate buffer only. Rats were continued on high fat diet until the end of study. To overcome the hypoglycemia during the first 24 h after STZ injection, diabetic rats were given 5% glucose solution instead of drinking water. Only animals with persistent blood glucose levels higher than 250 mg/dL for 7 days after STZ adminis- tration were considered diabetic.

Experimental design

Animals were divided into:

Control group: maintained on normal pellet diet (3.15 kcal/ g), and intraperitoneally received single dose of citrate buffer (0.1 M, pH 4.5).
Diabetic rats were divided into four groups as follows:
Diabetes: in which diabetes was induced as previously mentioned.

Diabetes + u-3: diabetic rats received u-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA) (10% of dietary intake of rats) [31].
Diabetes + pio: diabetic rats treated with pioglitazone (20 mg/kg body weight) [32].
Diabetes + u-3 + pio: diabetic rats treated with a combination of both u-3 fatty acids (10% of dietary
intake of rats) and pioglitazone (20 mg/kg body weight).

Treatments were administered by orogastric gavage, and continued for 4 weeks.

Body weight

Body weights were monitored weekly during the study.

Collection of blood and tissue samples

At the end of the experiment, blood samples were withdrawn
ture and centrifuged at 1200 × g for 10 min at 4 ◦C for serum from thiopental-anesthetized animals via retro-orbital punc- preparation. Immediately after sacrificing the rats, dissection
was done for isolation of the liver. Sections of liver tissues
stored at —80 ◦C for quantitative real-time reverse were collected, immediately immersed in liquid nitrogen, and transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis.
0.5 g of liver tissues were homogenized in 5 ml ice-cold phosphate buffer saline (0.02 M, pH 7.4) (10% w/v), centri-
fuged at 1500 × g for 15 min at 4 ◦C and frozen at —80 ◦C until
further analysis of FGF21 by ELISA technique.

Analysis of serum total cholesterol, triglycerides, and blood glucose

Serum triglycerides and total cholesterol concentrations were measured using commercial kits (Spinreact, Spain). Blood glucose was measured from tail vein using (ACCU-CHECK GO, Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) glucometer.

Measurementoffastinginsulinconcentration(mU/L)

Serum insulin concentration was measured by ELISA using commercially available kit (MyBioSource, Inc., California, USA).

Calculation of homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) HOMA-IR was calculated using the following formula
HOMA-IR = Fasting plasma glucose (mg/dl) × fasting insulin (mU/L)/405.


HOMA-IR, first described by Matthews et al. (1985), is a method for estimating insulin sensitivity [33].

Measurement of FGF21 concentration (pg/ml) using ELISA

FGF21 concentration was measured in serum and liver ho- mogenate by ELISA using a commercially available kit (MyBioSource, Inc., California, USA).

Gene expression of FGF21
RNA isolation and c-DNA synthesis
Total RNA was isolated from liver tissues using easy-RED
total RNA extraction kit (iNtRON Biotechnology, Seongnam,
extracted with chloroform, followed by centrifugation at 4 ◦C Korea) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA was to separate into aqueous and organic phases. RNA pellets
were recovered from the aqueous phase by isopropyl alcohol precipitation and resuspended in nuclease-free water (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). A total of 1 mg of RNA was used for c-DNA synthesis using Maxima First Strand cDNA Syn- thesis Kit for RT-qPCR (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.), ac- cording to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting c-
DNA products were stored at e 20 ◦C.
Real-time RT-PCR
Real-time RT-PCR was performed using Piko Real-PCR
System (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.), according to the manufacturer's instructions. For a final reaction volume of 20 mL, the following reagents were added: 4 mL HOT FIREPol EvaGreen qPCR Mix (Solis BioDyne, Tartu, Estonia), 1 mL each of forward and reverse 10 mM primers, 12 mL nuclease free water and 2 mL cDNA template. The primers used were designed using PREMIER Biosoft, USA and the specific gene sequences were obtained from Pubmed (Entrez Gene). Primer

Serum FGF21 was increased z 2-fold in diabetic (D) group, compared to control group. u-3 fatty acids, pioglitazone, and combination therapy significantly lowered serum FGF21, compared to diabetic (D) group (p < 0.001) (Fig. 4a). As for he- patic FGF21 concentration, diabetic (D) rats showed a highly
significant decrease, compared to control group (p < 0.01). Pioglitazone monotherapy caused a highly significant in- crease in hepatic FGF21 concentration (p < 0.001), while u-3

Discussion

Combining life style changes with pharmacological therapy has  become  mandatory  for  management  of  diseases
associated with metabolic disorders. Previous studies showed the effectiveness of combining u-3 fatty acids with thiazoli- dinediones, pioglitazone and rosiglitazone, in mice fed a high- fat diet, possibly through induction of adiponectin [34].
In this study, we generated a rat model for T2D using a high- fat diet followed by low dose STZ as previously described by Srinivasan et al. (2005) [30]. T2D was confirmed by hyperglyce- mia, mild hyperinsulinemia, and a significant increase in HOMA-
IR index in diabetic rats. Our study is the first to investigate the potential anti-diabetic effects of u-3 fatty acids and pioglitazone combination through modulating FGF21. We have also corre-
lated FGF21 changes with different metabolic parameters.

We have shown that u-3 fatty acids and pioglitazone combination exerted an additive improvement in insulin sensitivity. This is in agreement with previous studies that employed pioglitazone and rosiglitazone in combination with
u-3 fatty acids in rats fed a high-fat diet [34,35]. However, in
our study, rats were treated with much lower doses of pio- glitazone in the combination therapy and managed to revert insulin resistance.
The effect of u-3 fatty acids on insulin resistance has been
studied extensively leading to contradicting results. Consis- tent with our results, human studies suggested that none of u-
3 fatty acids improve insulin sensitivity [36,37]. Similarly, Gillam, et al. (2009) [11] found no beneficial effects of u-3 fatty acids on insulin sensitivity in fa/fa Zucker rats, a rat model of
insulin resistance. In a rat model of T2D induced by high fat diet, low dose STZ, Coppey et al. (2012) found that partial replacement of saturated fats with menhaden oil, a natural
source of u-3 fatty acids failed to improve impaired glucose
utilization [38].
On the other hand, several murine models of insulin resistance have shown beneficial effects of u-3 fatty acids in prevention or reversal of insulin resistance. In an obesity model of insulin resistance and fatty liver disease, dietary intake of fish oil (8% wt/wt) had insulin sensitizing actions in adipose tissue and liver [39]. In high sucrose diet-fed rats, 7%
fish oil supplementation reversed the insulin resistance [40]. However, the aforementioned studies are models of insulin resistance or pre-diabetes state, none of them represent a model of T2D, as we had in this study.
Pioglitazone caused significant reduction in blood glucose concentrations as shown in various animal species by acting
as insulin sensitizer [41]. u-3 fatty acids significantly decreased fasting blood glucose, but still in levels higher than normal ones. In a rat model of T2D, treatment with menhaden oil did not significantly change blood glucose levels, compared to untreated diabetic rats [38].
Combining u-3 fatty acids with pioglitazone resulted in a
strong synergistic triglyceride-lowering effect. This is in accordance with a previous study that showed an additive effect with higher pioglitazone doses [34]. In the current study, u-3 fatty acids significantly lowered total cholesterol and tri- glycerides, compared to the untreated group. u-3 fatty acids exert potential hypocholesterolemic effect through inhibition of key enzymes related to cholesterol synthesis and transfer such as 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl reductase and acyl-
CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase [42]. u-3 fatty acids selec- tively lower triglycerides by increasing glucose flux to glycogen, increasing mitochondrial b-oxidation, and decreasing triglycerides synthesis, an effect that is mediated partially by PPAR-a activation [43]. Pioglitazone was found to significantly lower total cholesterol and triglycerides concen- trations, compared to diabetic rats. PPAR-g activation controls a variety of genes involved in different pathways of lipid metabolism such as fatty acid uptake, fatty acid oxidation, lipolysis, and lipoprotein assembly and transport [44e46].
Pioglitazone and combination therapy significantly increased body weight, compared to diabetic group. Weight gain is a major side effect of pioglitazone treatment, since PPAR- g increases feeding by reducing leptin levels, a hormone that regulates satiety center [43].
Several studies have reported the use of FGF21 as an interesting external therapeutic agent for modulating insulin

resistance. Evidence from animal-based studies suggested that FGF21 possesses beneficial effects on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, improving obesity and diabetes [17,47]. As well, administration of recombinant FGF21 has been shown to reverse hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and dyslipidemia in ob/ob and diet-induced obese mice and in diabetic monkeys [48e50].
Consistent with our results, many studies showed that circulating FGF21 concentrations are elevated in insulin- resistant states, such as glucose intolerance and T2D [51e54], indicating a possible compensatory increase of FGF21 to over- come insulin resistance. PPAR is a pivotal regulator of hepatic FGF21 [27,55]. A recent study showed that FGF21 could be regulated by PPAR-g activation in pancreatic islets of mice [56]. We investigated the possibility of regulating FGF21 con- centrations in serum and liver and its gene expression by


combining u-3 fatty acids as a PPAR-a agonist with pioglita- zone as a PPAR-g agonist. Our results have shown that pio- glitazone, u-3 fatty acids, and their combination significantly
decreased serum FGF21, compared to diabetic group, allevi- ating the state of FGF21 resistance. Consistent with our re- sults, Villarroya et al. (2014) showed that long-term dietary
treatment with u-3 fatty acids significantly decreased FGF21
protein levels in plasma, compared to high fat diet group [57]. A study on patients with T2D showed that addition of piogli- tazone to exenatide therapy significantly reduced plasma FGF21 levels [58].
Fibroblast growth factor 21 was previously thought to be a hepatic hormone, preferentially expressed in the liver. How- ever, it was reported that other tissues as adipose and muscle tissue are important sources of FGF21 production [19,59e61]. In our study, serum FGF21 concentration was increased in

diabetic group, while its hepatic concentration was decreased. This discrepancy may be due to the contribution of adipose tissue and other tissues in circulating FGF21 concentration. Hepatic mRNA expression of FGF21 showed significant decrease in diabetic group, which correlated positively to he- patic FGF21 concentration. Consistent with our results, Oishi and Tomita (2011) showed that pioglitazone significantly increased hepatic FGF21 mRNA expression in mouse liver and in cultured hepatocytes [62].
In agreement with our results, recent studies of Jin et al. (2014) and Lin et al. (2014) found that circulating FGF21 was significantly and positively correlated with fasting blood glucose concentration and HOMA-IR [63,64]. Also, we have found a significant positive correlation between serum FGF21 and both serum total cholesterol and triglycerides, which is consistent with Matuszek et al. (2010) [59].

Conclusion

Combining PPAR-a agonists, as u-3 fatty acids, with PPAR-ˠ agonists, as pioglitazone, showed potential effects in lowering blood glucose concentration, improving lipid profile and in- sulin resistance. Such effects are mediated through modula- tion of FGF21 expression (Fig. 7).
