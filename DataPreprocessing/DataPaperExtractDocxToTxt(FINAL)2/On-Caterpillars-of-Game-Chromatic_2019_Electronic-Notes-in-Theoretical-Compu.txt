Abstract
The coloring game is played by Alice and Bob on a finite graph G. They take turns properly coloring the vertices with t colors. If at any point there is an uncolored vertex without available color, then Bob wins. The game chromatic number of G is the smallest number t such that Alice has a winning strategy. It is known that for forests this number is at most 4. We find exact values for the game chromatic number of an infinite subclass of forests (composed by caterpillars), in order to contribute to the open problem of characterizing forests with different game chromatic numbers. Moreover, we show two sufficient conditions and two necessary conditions for any tree and caterpillar to have game chromatic number 4, respectively.

Introduction

The coloring game is a combinatorial game conceived by Steven Brams with the aim of finding an alternative proof for the Four Color Theorem, firstly published in 1981 by Martin Gardner [6], still in the context of map-coloring game. In 1991, the game was reinvented by Bodlaender [1], who studied it in the context of graphs. Since then, the game has been much studied for different graph classes in order to obtain better upper and lower bounds to χg(G) [2,3,7,8,10,11,12]. The first application of a variation of this game to a non-game graph packing problem was presented in 2009 by Kierstead and Kostochka [9].
Given t colors, Alice and Bob take turns properly coloring an uncolored vertex. The goal of Alice is to color the input graph with t colors, and Bob does his best to prevent it. Alice wins if at the end the graph is completely properly colored with t colors; otherwise, Bob wins. Bob wins if after some point, we cannot color a new vertex in a proper way with t colors. The game chromatic number χa(G) (or simply χg(G)) of G is the smallest number t of colors that ensures that Alice wins when she starts the game. We find convenient to allow Bob to start the game as well, and we introduce the auxiliary parameter χb (G) that is the smallest number t of colors that ensures that Alice wins when Bob starts the game, which is a powerful tool in our proofs.
Observe that χ(G) ≤ χg(G) ≤ Δ(G) + 1 (for details about the relationship between these graph invariants, see [11]), where χ(G) denotes the chromatic num- ber and Δ(G) the maximum degree. So, we have that a complete graph Kn has χg(Kn)= n and an independent set Sn has χg(Sn) = 1. Analyzing the game chro- matic number of paths Pn, with n vertices, we can quickly check that χg(P1) = 1 and χg(P2)= χg(P3) = 2. For n ≥ 4, we have that χg(Pn) = 3 because, regardless of where Alice colors at her first turn, Bob can always give a different color to a vertex at distance 2 of the vertex that Alice colored, forcing the third color. Using the same idea, we have that a cycle Cn, with n ≥ 3, has χg(Cn) = 3. A star K1,p, with p ≥ 1, has χg(K1,p) = 2, and moreover, the stars are the only connected graphs satisfying χg(G)=2 [3].
Bodlaender [1] showed an example of a tree with game chromatic number at least 4 and proved that every tree has game chromatic number at most 5. In 1993, Faigle et al. [4] improved this bound by proving that every forest F has game chromatic number at most 4. Extending Faigle et al.’s algorithm that proves that χg(F ) ≤ 4, we prove that χb (F ) ≤ 4. Despite the vast literature in this area, only in 2015, Dunn et al. [3] considered the distinction between forests with different game chromatic numbers, by investigating special cases. They characterized forests with game chromatic number 2, and they investigated the distinction between forests with game chromatic number 3 and 4, using properties that depend on a certain set of vertices to be colored during the game. Actually, they do not provide any kind of characterization of these forests, suggesting as an open problem, due to the difficulty concerning this subject. In our work, we contribute to this study by analyzing a special tree called the caterpillar.

A caterpillar H = cat(k1, k2,..., ks) is a tree obtained from a central path v1, v2, v3, ..., vs (called spine) by joining ki leaf vertices to vi, for each i = 1,..., s. If ki ≥ 1, then we say that the vertex vi has ki adjacent leg leaves.
The motivation to focus on caterpillars relies on the fact that Bodlaender [1] proved the existence of a tree with χg(T ) ≥ 4 by considering the caterpillar Hd = cat(0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0) depicted in Figure 1. Actually, Dunn et al. [3] proved that the caterpillar Hd is the smallest tree such that χg(T ) = 4, and is the unique tree with fourteen vertices and game chromatic number 4.

Fig. 1. The caterpillar Hd satisfies χg(Hd)= 4.
Faigle et al. [4] proved for trees that χg(T ) ≤ 4 and stated that there is no loss of generality when we think of forests, that is, the proof that χg(T ) ≤ 4 can be extended to obtain χg(F ) ≤ 4.
Dunn et al. [3] aimed to determine if the maximum degree was a relevant characteristic for classifying the game chromatic number 3, and they conjectured that the maximum degree alone is not relevant, and we agree with this conjecture. In [5], we contributed to this problem by characterizing two infinite subclasses of caterpillars:
a caterpillar H with maximum degree 3 that is not a star has χg(H)=3 (Theorem 2.1 [5]);
a caterpillar H without vertex of degree 2 has χg(H) = 4 if, and only if, H has at least four vertices of degree at least 4 (Theorem 2.7 [5]).
Motivated by this work, in Section 3, we analyze the infinite subclass of cater- pillars without vertex of degree 3, determining its game chromatic number: a cater- pillar H without vertex of degree 3 has χg(H) = 4 if, and only if, H has at least one induced subgraph of family Q (that we present further in Section 3). This result is presented in 3.5. But first, in Section 2, we show two sufficient conditions and two necessary conditions for any caterpillar to have χg(H)= 4.
Since Faigle et al. [4] and Dunn et al. [3] worked with forests, the natu- ral question that we can ask is: in a forest F with r tree connected compo- nents Ti, 1 ≤ i ≤ r, is it true that χg(F ) = max {χg(Ti)| i = 1, ..., r}? And χg(F ) ≤ max {χg(Ti)| i = 1, ..., r}? The answer is no, and we have presented coun- terexamples in [5].
In Section 4, we determine χg(F ), for a forest, by knowing χa(Ti), χb (Ti) and
g	g
the parity of |V (Ti)| for each tree component Ti of F .
Caterpillar
We recall that, by Faigle et al. [4], every caterpillar H, which is not a star, has 3 ≤ χg(H) ≤ 4. So, we are interested in characterizing caterpillars with χg(H) equal to 3 or 4. We refer to Figure 2 for the four caterpillars H1, H2, H3 and H4

that we shall use throughout the paper.


Fig. 2. The partially colored caterpillars (a) H1 (b) H2 (c) H3 (d) H4.


First, we introduce two auxiliary parameters. Let Z be the colored subset of vertices of V (G), i.e., for all v ∈ Z, c(v) /= ∅, where c(v) is the color of vertex v. We denote by χg(G, Z) the smallest number t of colors that ensures that Alice wins in the partially colored graph G.
Lemma 2.1 [5] Let H1 be the caterpillar (claw) cat(0, 1, 0), H2 be the caterpil- lar cat(0, 1, 0, 1, 0), H3 be the caterpillar cat(0, 1, 2, 0), and H4 be the caterpillar cat(0, 2, 2, 0). Considering the partially colored cases, as in Figure 2, we have that:
χa(H1, Z)=3 and χb (H1, Z)= 4, with Z = {v1, v3|c(v1) /= c(v3)};
g	g
χa(H2, Z)=3 and χb (H2, Z)= 4, with Z = {v1, v5};
g	g
χa(H3, Z)=3 and χb (H3, Z)= 4, with Z = {v1, v4};
g	g
χa(H4, Z) = 3 and χb (H4, Z) = 4, with Z  = {v1, v4|c(v1) /= c(v4)}, but
g	g
χa(H4, Zj)= χb (H4, Zj)= 4, where Zj = {v1, v4|c(v1)= c(v4)}.
g	g
In Theorems 2.2 and 2.3, we will show sufficient conditions for χg(T ) = 4 for any tree T .
Theorem 2.2 If a tree T has an induced subtree T j, such that χa(T j)= χb (T j)= 4,
g	g
then χa(T )= χb (T )= 4.
g	g
Proof. If Bob starts, then he colors in V (T j) and χb (T ) = 4. If Alice starts, then she can color in V (T j) or not. If she colors in V (T j), then χa(T ) = 4. If she avoids to color in V (T j), then Bob does it and, χa(T )= 4.	2
Theorem 2.3 If a tree T has two induced subtrees T j and T jj, such that χb (T j)= 
χb (T jj)= 4, then χa(T )= χb (T )= 4.
g	g	g
Proof. If Alice starts the game in T , then she can color any vertex. Bob colors in V (T j) or V (T jj), choosing a subtree that is not colored. Thus, χa(T ) = 4. If Bob starts, then he colors in V (T j) and χb (T )= 4.	2
In Theorems 2.11 and 2.13, we will show necessary conditions for χg(H)=4 for any caterpillar H, but first we need auxiliary lemmas.
Lemma 2.4 Let H be a caterpillar cat(k1,.	, ks) such that k1 = ks = 0, ks—1 = 1,
and ki ≤ 1, for all i = 2, ..., s — 2. We have that χa(H, Z), χb (H, Z) ≤ 3, with
g	g
Z = {v1, vs, λs—1|c(v1) /= c(vs), c(vs)= c(λs—1)}, where λs—1 is the leg leaf adjacent
to vs—1.

Proof. If Alice starts, then she colors vs—1, if s is odd; or vs—2, if s is even, and by Claim 1 of Lemma 2.1 [5], χa(H, Z) ≤ 3. If Bob starts, then the proof follows by induction in s.	2
Lemma 2.5 Let H be a caterpillar cat(k1,.  , ks) with s odd, k1 = ks—1 = ks = 0,
and Δ(H) ≤ 3. We have that H has χb (H, Z) ≤ 3, with Z = {v1, vs}.
Proof. This proof follows by induction in s.
When s = 3, we have cat(0, 0, 0) with v1 and v3 colored and, χb (H, Z) ≤ 3. Assume that the result is true for any caterpillar H with 3 ≤ s ≤ z, for z odd.
Now, we analyze the caterpillar Hj with s = z + 2.
If Bob colors a spine vertex vi, then the result follows by Claim 1 of Lemma
[5] and induction hypothesis. If Bob colors a leg leaf adjacent to vi, where i is odd, then Alice colors vi—1, and the result follows by Claim 1 of Lemma 2.1 [5] and Lemma 2.4; i is even, then Alice colors vi, and the result follows by Claim 1 of Lemma 2.1 [5].	2
Lemma 2.6 Let H be a caterpillar cat(k1,..., ks) such that k1 = ks = 0, k2 ≥ 2,
ks—1 = 1, and ki ≤ 1, for all i = 3,...,s — 2. We have that χa(H, Z), χb (H, Z) ≤
g	g
3, with Z = {v1, vs, λs—1|c(v1) /= c(vs), c(vs)= c(λs—1)}, where λs—1 is the leg leaf
adjacent to vs—1.
Proof. First, when Alice starts, she colors v2 with the same color of vs, if s is odd, or she colors v3 with the same color of v1, if s is even. So, the induced subcaterpillar cat(k2,..., ks) or cat(k3,..., ks), respectively, is a caterpillar with maximum degree 3 and has both extremes colored (since c(vs) = c(λs—1), we can ignore λs—1) and, by Claim 1 of Lemma 2.1 [5], χa(H, Z) ≤ 3.
Now, we prove the case when Bob starts by induction in s.
If s = 4, then χb (H, Z) ≤ 3. Assume that χb (H, Z) ≤ 3, for 4 ≤ s ≤ z. When
g	g
s = z + 1, Bob can start coloring a spine vertex or a leg leaf. If Bob colors a leg leaf
adjacent to vi, then Alice colors vi+1, and the result follows by induction hypothesis and Claim 1 of Lemma 2.1 [5]. If Bob colors vi and vi—1 has an adjacent leg leaf, then Alice colors it, which is analogous to the previous case. If Bob colors vi and vi—1 does not have an adjacent leg leaf (d(vi—1) = 2), then Alice colors vi+1, and the result follows by induction hypothesis and Lemma 2.4.	2
Lemma 2.7 Let H be a caterpillar cat(k1,..., ks), such that k1 = ks = 0, k2 ≥ 2
and ki ≤ 1, for all i = 3,...,s — 1. We have that χa(H, Z), χb (H, Z) ≤ 3, with
g	g
Z = {v1}.
Proof. If Alice starts, then she colors v2, and the result follows by Claim 2 of Lemma 2.1 [5].
If Bob starts, then he can color a spine vertex vi or a leg leaf. If he colors vi, then Alice colors v2 (for i is odd) or v3 with the same color of v1 (for i is even) and, by Claim 1 and 2 of Lemma 2.1 [5], the result follows. If Bob colors a leg leaf adjacent to vi, then Alice colors vi+1, and the result follows by Claim 2 of Lemma
2.1 [5] and Lemma 2.6.	2

Lemma 2.8 Let H be a caterpillar cat(k1,..., ks) such that k1 = ks = 0, ks—1 = 1, there exists j ∈ {3,...,s — 2} with kj ≥ 2, and ki ≤ 1, for all i = 2, ..., j — 1,j + 1,...,s — 2.  We have that χa(H, Z), χb (H, Z) ≤ 3, with
g	g
Z = {v1, vs, λs—1|c(v1) /= c(vs), c(vs)= c(λs—1)}, where λs—1 is the leg leaf adjacent
to vs—1.
Proof. If j is odd, then Alice colors vj—1, and the result follows by Claim 1 of Lemma 2.1 [5] and Lemma 2.6. Else, Alice colors vj, and the result follows by Claim 1 of Lemma 2.1 [5].
When Bob starts, the proof follows by induction similarly to Lemma 2.6 (induc- tion basis s = 5).	2
Lemma 2.9 Let H be a caterpillar cat(k1,..., ks) such that k1 = ks = 0, there exists j ∈ {3,..., s—2} with kj ≥ 2 and ki ≤ 1, for all i = 2,...,j—1,j+1,.	, s—1.
We have that χa(H, Z) ≤ 3 and χb (H, Z) ≤ 4, with Z = {v1, vs|c(v1) /= c(vs)}.
g	g
Proof. If there is a leg leaf adjacent to v2 or vs—1, then Alice colors it with the same color of v1 or vs, respectively, and the result follows by Lemma 2.8. Else, Alice colors vj, and the result follows by Lemma 2.5.
The proof that χb (H, Z) ≤ 4 is presented in Lemma 2.5 [5].	2
Lemma 2.10 Let H be a caterpillar cat(k1,..., ks), such that k1 = ks = 0, there exists j ∈ {2,...,s — 1} with kj ≥ 2 i and ki ≤ 1, for all i = 2,.	,j — 1,j +
1,.	,s — 1. We have that χa(H, Z), χb (H, Z) ≤ 3, with Z = {v1}.
g	g
Proof. If j is even, then Alice colors vj, and the result follows by Claim 1 and 2 of Lemma 2.1 [5]. If j is odd, then Alice colors vj—1, and the result follows by Claim 1 of Lemma 2.1 [5] and Lemma 2.7.
When Bob starts, he can color a spine vertex vi or a leg leaf. If he colors: (i) a spine vertex vi, for i > j, then the result follows by Lemma 2.9 and Claim 2 of Lemma 2.1 [5]; (ii) a spine vertex vi, for i = j, the result follows by Claim 1 and 2 of Lemma 2.1 [5]; (iii) a leg leaf adjacent to vi, for i ≥ j, then Alice colors vi+1, and the result follows by Lemma 2.6 and Claim 2 of Lemma 2.1 [5]; (iv) a spine vertex vi or a leg leaf adjacent to vi, for i < j, we use induction in s to prove the result as follows.
If s = 3, then Bob can color v2 or the leaf adjacent to it.  In both cases,
χb (H, Z) ≤ 3.
Assume that χb (H, Z) ≤ 3 for s ≤ z. When s = z + 1, Bob can color a spine vertex or a leg leaf. If he colors a spine vertex vi, the result follows by Claim 1 or 2 of Lemma 2.1 [5] and by induction hypothesis. If he colors a leg leaf adjacent to vi, then Alice colors vi+1 with the same color, and the result follows by Lemma 2.6 and by induction hypothesis.	2
Theorem 2.11 If a caterpillar H has χg(H)= 4, then H has at least four vertices of degree at least 4.
Proof. If H has just one vertex of degree at least 4, vi, then Alice colors vi, and by Claim 2 of Theorem 2.1 [5], we have that χg(H)= 3.

If H has exactly two vertices of degree at least 4, vi and vj, then Alice colors vi, and by Theorem 2.1 [5] and Lemma 2.10, we have that χg(H)= 3.
If H has exactly three vertices of degree at least 4, vi, vj and vk, with i < j < k, then Alice colors vj, and by Lemma 2.10, we have that χg(H)= 3.	2
Lemma 2.12 Let Hj = cat(k1,..., kp) and Hjj = cat(kq,..., ks) be caterpillars such that p < q , kp = kq = 0, χa(Hj) = χa(Hjj) = χb (Hjj) = 3, and χb (Hj) ≥ 3.
g	g	g	g
Let H be a caterpillar constructed by linking vertex vp of Hj to vertex vq of Hjj by
a path, that is H = cat(k1,..., kp,..., kq,..., ks), for p /= q and ki = 0, for all
i ∈ {p,..., q}. We have that χa(H)= 3.
Proof. Alice colors a vertex in Hj. If Bob colors in V (Hj) or V (Hjj), then Alice colors in the same subcaterpillar. If Bob colors a vertex vi, i ∈ {p,..., q}, then Alice continues coloring vertices in Hj or Hjj until all them are colored, because even if just Bob colors the vertices in the subpath vp,..., vq, it does not increases the game chromatic number of H.	2
Theorem 2.13 If H is a minimal caterpillar with respect to χa(H) = 4, then H does not have consecutive vertices of degree 2, unless H has two edge disjoint induced subcaterpillars Hj and Hjj that are minimal with respect to χb (Hj)=4 and
χb (Hjj)= 4.
Proof. Suppose that there are at least two consecutive vertices of degree 2 in V (H), and at most one induced subcaterpillar that is minimal with respect to game chromatic number 4 when Bob starts. Let H = cat(k1, ..., kp, ..., kq, ..., ks) such that ki = 0, p ≤ i ≤ q and p /= q. Let Hj = cat(k1, ..., kp) and Hjj = cat(kq, ..., ks) be two induced subcaterpillars of H. Since H is minimal with respect to χa(H)= 4, we have that χa(Hj), χa(Hjj) ≤ 3. And since there does not exist two edge disjoint
g	g
induced subcaterpillars that are minimal with respect to game chromatic number
4 when Bob starts, we have that only one of χb (Hj) and χb (Hjj) is 4.  So, by
g	g
Lemma 2.12, χa(H)= 3.
If there are two edge disjoint induced subcaterpillars Hj and Hjj that are minimal with respect to χb (Hj)=4 and χb (Hjj) = 4, by Theorem 2.3, we have that χa(H)= 
g	g	g
4, and H could be minimal with respect to χa(H)= 4.	2



Caterpillar without vertex of degree 3
We define the Family Q: infinite subclass of caterpillars without vertices of degree 3 which has game chromatic number 4. In Theorem 3.5 we show that having a caterpillar of Family Q as a subgraph is a necessary and sufficient condition for a caterpillar without vertex of degree 3 to have game chromatic number equals 4.
Lemma 3.1 If H is a caterpillar cat(k1, ..., ks) without vertex of degree 3 and H
has no consecutive vertices of degree at least 4, then χa(H), χb (H) ≤ 3.
g	g

Proof. First, Alice colors a spine vertex of degree at least 4. Bob colors a vertex u ∈ V (H). If there is an uncolored vertex of degree at least 4, then Alice colors the closest vertex of degree at least 4 to the vertex u. This process continues until there is no uncolored vertex of degree at least 4. So, in this moment there are just uncolored vertices of degree at most 2. To color each leaf it is necessary just a different color of its adjacent vertex in the spine, so, three colors are sufficient. By Claim 1 of Theorem 2.1 [5], to color the induced partially colored subpaths, three colors are sufficient too.	2
To characterize the caterpillars without vertex of degree 3 and χg(H) = 4, by Lemma 3.1, it remains to consider caterpillars that have an induced H4 = cat(0, 2, 2, 0) (as in Lemma 2.1).  We define Ht = cat(0, 2, 2, 2, 0) and Hα =
cat(0, 2, 0, 2, 0, ..., 0, 2, 0) with α vertices of degree 2. So, Hα has 2α — 1 vertices, for α ≥ 2. Now, we connect these caterpillars by identifying at least two vertices. Please refer to Figure 3.
H33: composed by two copies of Ht; we identify v5 of a Ht with v1 of another
Ht;
H[α]: composed by Hα and two copies of H4; we identify v4 of a H4 with v1 of a
Hα, and v2α—1 of Hα with v1 of H4;
H[α][β]: composed by Ht, Hα and three copies of H4; we identify v4 of a H4 with v1 of a Hα, and v2α—1 of H4 with v1 of H4, and v4 of the second H4 with v1 of Hβ, and finally v2β—1 of Hβ with v1 of a third H4;
H[α]3[β]: composed by Ht, Hα, Hβ and two copies of H4; we identify v4 of a H4 with v1 of a Hα, and v2α—1 of Hα with v1 of Ht, and v5 of the Ht with v1 of Hβ, and finally v2β—1 of Hβ with v1 of a third H4.

Lemma 3.2 If a caterpillar H has an induced subcaterpillar Hd (Figure 1), then
χa(H)= χb (H)= 4.
g	g
Proof. We know that χa(Hd) = 4 by Theorem 18 of [3]. Let us prove that χb (Hd)= 
g	g
4. Bob colors v1 ∈ V (Hd) with color 1. To prevent the hypothesis of Lemma 2.1(iv),
Alice can color a spine vertex or a leg leaf. If she colors v2 with color 2 (or v3
with color 1), then Bob colors v5 with color 2 (or v6 with color 1, resp.) and, by

Lemma 2.1.(iv), χa(H) ≥ 4. If Alice colors a leg leaf adjacent to v2 (or v3), then Bob colors the other leg leaf adjacent to v2 (or v3, resp.) with a different color, forcing Alice to color v2 (v3), and by Lemma 2.1(iv), χb (H)= 4.
Thus, χa(H)= χb (H) = 4, by Theorem 2.2.	2
g	g
Lemma 3.3 If H is a caterpillar without vertex of degree 3, χa(H) = 3, H has no induced subcaterpillar with game chromatic number 4, and H is minimal with respect to χb (H)= 4, then H does not have consecutive vertices of degree 2.
Proof. Suppose that there are at least two consecutive vertices of degree 2 in V (H). Let H = cat(k1, ..., kp, ..., kq, ..., ks) such that ki = 0, p ≤ i ≤ q and p /= q. Let Hj = cat(k1, ..., kp) and Hjj = cat(kq, ..., ks) be two induced subcaterpillars of H. Since H is minimal with respect to χb (H) = 4, we have that χb (Hj), χb (Hjj) ≤ 3; and
g	g	g
since there are no induced subcaterpillar with game chromatic number 4, we have
that χa(Hj), χb (Hjj) ≤ 3. By Lemma 2.12, χa(H) = 3, which is a contradiction. 2
g	g	g
Lemma 3.4 H is a caterpillar without vertex of degree 3, χa(H) = 3, H has no induced subcaterpillar with game chromatic number 4, and H is minimal with respect to χb (H)=4 if, and only if, H = H[α], for l ≥ 1.
Proof. By Lemma 3.1, H need at least two consecutive vertices of degree at least 4 to obtain χg(H) = 4. By Lemma 3.2, we know that χb (Hd) = 4, but χa(Hd)=4 by
g	g
Theorem 18 of [3]. So, we search caterpillars with two or three consecutive vertices
of degree at least 4.
Assume that H has two consecutive vertices of degree at least 4. Let us con- struct this caterpillar: d(v1) = 0, d(v2), d(v3) ≥ 4 and, necessarily, d(v4) = 2. By Lemma 3.3, d(v5) ≥ 4. If d(v6) ≥ 4, then we have a minimal caterpillar with respect to χb (H)=4 and χa(H) = 3, that is H[1] = cat(0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0). If d(v6)= 2, then
g	g
we analyze v7. By Lemma 3.3, d(v7) ≥ 4. We can construct a sequence of d4+2j =2 
and d5+2j ≥ 4, for i ≥ 1 and it is not sufficient to get χb (H) = 4. We finish this sequence with two consecutive vertices of degree at least 4, getting exactly H[α].
Assume that H has three consecutive vertices of degree at least 4. So, we have that d(v1) = 0, d(v2), d(v3), d(v4) ≥ 4 and d(v5) = 2. By Lemma 3.3, d(v6) ≥ 4. If d(v7) ≥ 4, then H has an induced subcaterpillar H[1] that has χb (H[1]) = 4. So, d(v7) = 2. By Lemma 3.3, d(v8) ≥ 4, and we can construct a sequence of d5+2j =2 and d6+2j ≥ 4, for i ≥ 1 and it is not sufficient to get χb (H) = 4. We finish this sequence with two adjacent vertices of degree at least 4, getting a caterpillar H that has H[α] as an induced subcaterpillar. So, H is not minimal with respect to χb (H)= 4.
Conversely, we have that H[α] does not have vertex of degree 3. If Alice starts, then she colors v3 and χa(H[l]) = 3. If Bob starts, then he colors v4 and χb (H[α])= 
g	g
4.	2
We denote by H[α] ∪ H[β] the caterpillar that has two edge disjoint induced subcaterpillars H[α] and H[β], for α, β ≥ 1.
Let family Q be the set of caterpillars Hd, H33, H[α] ∪ H[β], H[α][β] and H[α]3[β].

Theorem 3.5 A caterpillar H without vertex of degree 3 has χg(H) = 4 if, and only if, H has a caterpillar of family Q as an induced subcaterpillar.
Proof. First, if caterpillar H without vertex of degree 3 has χg(H) = 4, then H has at least four vertices of degree at least 4, by Theorem 2.11. Moreover, H does not have consecutive vertices of degree 2 or there exists two minimal induced subcaterpillars with respect to game chromatic number 4 when Bob starts the game, by Theorem 2.13.
Let us analyze H without consecutive vertices of degree 2. According to Lemma 3.4, since H has no vertex of degree 3, the unique caterpillar that has game chromatic number 4 when Bob starts the game is H[α]. So, the caterpillar that has no vertex of degree 3 and two induced subcaterpillars with game chromatic number 4 when Bob starts the game is H[α] ∪ H[β], for α, β ≥ 1.
Analyzing the case in which H does not have consecutive vertices of degree 2, we have the following. If H has four consecutive vertices of degree at least 4, then we have H = Hd, that is minimal with respect to χg(Hd) = 4. By Lemma 3.1, H should have consecutive vertices of degree at least 4 to satisfy χg(H) = 4. So, we have to study the case when H has two or three consecutive vertices of degree at least 4. We assume that d(v1)= 0.
Assume that H has two consecutive vertices of degree at least 4. So, we have two vertices of degree at least 4 followed by a vertex of degree 2 (because H has no vertex of degree 3), that is followed by a vertex of degree at least 4 (because H has no consecutive vertices of degree 2). We can have an arbitrary sequence of vertices of degree 2 and at least 4, but this caterpillar has game chromatic number 3, because Alice colors v3. So, this sequence need to finish for obtain χg(H) = 4, and we do this avoiding other pair of consecutive vertices of degree at least 4. At this point, we constructed H[α], for α ≥ 1, but χg(H[α]) = 3, which made us continue with a sequence of vertices of degree 2 and at least 4, getting a game chromatic number 3 yet, by Alice coloring vertex v5. So, we finish this sequence, and we do this avoiding another pair of consecutive vertices of degree at least 4, constructing H[α][β], that is minimal with respect to χg(H[α][β])= 4.
Now, assume that H has three consecutive vertices of degree at least 4. So, we have three vertices of degree at least 4 followed by a vertex of degree 2 (because H has no vertex of degree 3), that is followed by a vertex of degree at least 4 (because H has no consecutive vertices of degree 2). We can have an arbitrary sequence of vertices of degree 2 and at least 4, but this caterpillar has game chromatic number 3, because Alice colors v3. So, we finish this sequence for obtain χg(H) = 4, and we do this avoiding other three consecutive vertices of degree at least 4 (to distinguish from the last case). At this point, the game chromatic number is 3, which made us continue with a sequence of vertices of degree 2 and at least 4, getting a game chromatic number 3 yet, by Alice coloring vertex v6. So, we finish this sequence, and we do this avoiding another pair of consecutive vertices of degree at least 4. This caterpillar has H[α]3[β] as an induced subcaterpillar, which is minimal with respect to χg(H[l]3[r])= 4.
Assuming that H has at most three consecutive vertices of degree at least 4 is

also possible that we have these three vertices of degree at least 4 followed by a vertex of degree 2 (because H has no vertex of degree 3), that is followed by three vertices of degree at least 4. So, we construct H33, that is minimal with respect to χg(H33)= 4.
Conversely, by Theorem 2.2, we need to prove that each subclass of caterpillar of Family Q has game chromatic number 4 when both Alice and Bob starts the game: Hd was proved in Lemma 3.2; H[α] ∪ H[β] by Lemma 2.1(iv) and Theorem 2.3; H33, H[α][β] and H[α][β] by Lemma 2.1(iv).	2


Forest
First, we observe that χb (F ) ≤ 4, for F forest, using the same idea of Faigle et al.’s algorithm to prove that χa(F ) ≤ 4. Since, stars are the only connected
graphs with game chromatic number equals 2, we have that (χa(T ), χb (T )) ⊆
g	g
{(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)}. Finally, we analyze the game chro-
matic number of a forest.
Theorem 4.1 Let F be a forest composed by r trees T1, ..., Tr. Assume that
χa(T1) ≤ χa(T2) ≤ ... ≤ χa(Tr), and, if there exist two trees with the same game
g	g	g
chromatic number, then Ti and Tj are ordered in a way that χb (Ti) ≤ χb (Tj), for
g	g
i < j. We have that:
If χb (Tr) > χa(Tr), χb (Tr—1), then χg(F )= χa(Tr);
g	g	g	g
If χb (Tr)= χb (Tr—1) > χa(Tr), then χg(F )= χb (Tr);
g	g	g	g
If χa(Tr)= χb (Tr), then χg(F )= χa(Tr)= χb (Tr);
g	g	g	g
If χb (Tr) < χa(Tr) and Σr—1 |V (Ti)| is even, then χg(F )= χa(Tr);
g	g	i=1	g
If χb (Tr) < χa(Tr) and Σr—1 |V (Ti)| is odd, then χg(F )= 
g	g	}i=1
g	g
Proof.
Alice plays in Tr to avoid that Bob starts in Tr in his first turn. So, χg(F )= 
max  χa(Tr), χb (Tr—1)  = χa(Tr).
g	g	g
Independent of where Alice plays, Bob can start playing in Tr—1 or Tr. So,
χg(F )= χb (Tr).
Since χa(Tr) and χb (Tr) are maximum values of game chromatic numbers in
g	g
F , independent of who starts in Tr, χg(F )= χa(Tr)= χb (Tr).
g	g
Since χa(Tr) is the maximum value of game chromatic numbers in F , Alice tries not to play in Tr, but as Σr—1 |V (Ti)| is even, Bob can force Alice to
start in Tr. So, χg(F )= χa(Tr).
Since χa(Tr) is the maximum value of game chromatic numbers in F , Alice tries not to play in Tr, and as Σr—1 |V (Ti)| is odd, Alice can force Bob to start

in Tr. So, χg(F )= max χa(F\Tr), χb (Tr)}.
