Abstract
In the context of Kolmogorov’s algorithmic approach to the foundations of probability, Martin-Lo¨f defined the concept of an individual random sequence using the concept of a constructive measure 1 set. Alternate characterizations use constructive martingales and measures of impossibility. We prove a direct conversion of a constructive martingale into a measure of impossibility and vice versa, such that their success sets, for a suitably defined class of computable probability measures, are equal. The direct conversion is then gen- eralized to give a new characterization of constructive dimensions, in particular, the constructive Hausdorff dimension and the constructive packing dimension.
Keywords: Algorithmic Randomness, Measures of Impossibility, s-Gale, Martingale, Constructive Dimension


Introduction
One of the prime successes of the algorithmic approach to the foundations of prob- ability theory envisioned by Kolmogorov is Martin-Lo¨f’s definition of an individual random sequence [11] using a constructive measure theory. The measure-theoretic approach to the definition of random sequences identifies a property of “typical” sets. A random sequence is one that belongs to every reasonable majority of se- quences [4]. The notion of a reasonable majority is formulated as an effective version of measure 1. Each measure 1 set has a complement set of measure 0. It is hence sufficient to define the concept of the effective measure zero set.
Let P be a computable probability measure defined on the Cantor Space (defined in section 3). For finite strings x, we consider cylinders Cx, the set of all infinite sequences with x as a prefix. A set S of sequences from the sample space of all

sequences has P -measure zero if, for each ε > 0, there is a sequence of cylinders
Cx0 , Cx1 ,... , Cxi ,... of cylinder sets such that
S ⊆ ∪iCxi and P (∪iCxi ) < ε.
A set of sequences S has effective P -measure zero if there is a computable function
h(i, ε) such that h(i, ε)= Cxi for each i.
Martin-Lo¨f proved a universality property – that for any computable measure P , there is a unique largest effective P -measure zero set. The elements in the complement of this set are the set of P -random sequences.
Another tool in the study of effective randomness is the concept of martingales. Introduced by Ville in the 1930s [17] (being implicit in the early work of L´evy [5], [6]), they were applied in theoretical computer science by Schnorr in the early 1970s [12], [13], [14] in his investigation of Martin-Lo¨f randomness, and by Lutz [7], [8],
[9] in the development of resource-bounded measure. A martingale is a betting strategy, which, for a probability measure P defined on the Cantor Space, obeys the conditions,
d(λ) ≤ 1
d(w)P (w)= d(w0)P (w0) + d(w1)P (w1).	(1)
Intuitively, it can be seen as betting strategy on an infinite sequence, where, for each prefix w of the infinite sequence, the amount d(w) is the capital that is in hand after betting. A martingale can be seen as a fair betting condition where the expected value after every bet is the same as the expected value before the bet is made. It is said to succeed on a sequence ω if
lim sup d(ω[0 ... n − 1]) = ∞.
n→∞

The success set of a martingale, S∞[d], is the set of all individual sequences on which it succeeds. In this work, we consider constructive martingales. There is a universal martingale d' which is constructive and for every ω, if there is a constructive mar- tingale d which succeeds on ω, then d' succeeds on ω. The theory of martingales and their applications to the field of resource-bounded measure, complexity theory, and resource-bounded dimension has proved to be remarkably fruitful. In this work, we wish to establish connections between martingales and a third approach of defining randomness, viz., that of a measure of impossibility.
This third approach to define a random sequence is to characterize a degree of disagreement between any sequence ω and the probability P . Following [18], a measure of impossibility is a function p(ω) which describes the quantitative level to which ω is impossible with respect to the probability measure P . A measure of impossibility is defined to be a lower semicomputable function p, which is integrable with respect to P . It can be seen that if ω is P -random, then p(ω) < ∞. There is an optimal measure of impossibility p˜ such that a sequence ω is random if and only if p˜(ω)= ∞ [18], [19]. This concept is a central one in V’yugin’s proof of an effective version of the Ergodic Theorem [19].

The relation between martingales and Martin-Lo¨f’s definition of randomness was studied by Schnorr [12], [13], [14]. The proof that the notion of randomness defined by Martin-L¨of corresponds to that of the ones defined via the measures of impossibility is due to Vovk and V’yugin [18] and V’yugin [19]. We establish a direct correspondence between the notions of constructive martingales and measures of impossibility.
We then apply this construction to come up with an analogous new definition of constructive dimension in terms of a generalized version of the notion of a measure of impossibility.
The main difference between a proof based on martingales and one using a mea- sure of impossibility is that a martingale is defined on the basis cylinders, and a measure of impossibility is a pointwise notion. Measure of impossibility seems to be an easier tool in dealing with theorems in which we have to reason about the convergence of general random variables defined on the points in the sample space. However, we show that at the constructive level, these tools are equivalent. Since there are universal objects available in both the cases, there exists an indirect con- version between the two such that the success set of a martingale can be converted into that of a measure of impossibility and conversely; this work contributes a direct constructive conversion of one into another. The theory of algorithmic randomness has been remarkably fruitful to date. (For a survey of the field, see [2].) Martingales have proved to have greater apparent utility in some cases than Martin-L¨of tests in studying randomness, and measures of impossibility have been of use in establish- ing a remarkable result in the study of algorithmic randomness. We hope that the explicit transformation of this work will improve the understanding, and perhaps the utility of measure of impossibility. Moreover, in the absence of universal objects which happens at computable and other levels a conversion of this nature may be useful.

Preliminaries
We consider the binary alphabet Σ = {0, 1}. The empty string is denoted by λ. The set of finite strings from the alphabet is denoted as Σ∗ and the set of infinite sequences, as C, the Cantor Space. For finite strings y, x, and infinite sequences ω, we denote x to be a prefix of y or of ω as x ± y, or as x ± ω, respectively. We adopt the convention, for all sequences and strings x, for all 0 ≤ n ≤ |x|, the n-length prefix of x is denoted x[0 ... n − 1] (this is always finite), and for n > |x|, we have x[0 ... n − 1] = x by notation.
Following the common notation, N represents the set of natural numbers, Q the set of rational numbers and Z the set of integers. Denote R for R ∪ {−∞, ∞}, R+ for the non-negative reals, and R+ for R+ ∪ {∞}.
We define the notion of lower semicomputability for the natural topology on the product space C × Q or Σ∗ × Q. The natural topology on Q or Σ∗ is discrete (i.e., the topology made of the set of all subsets of Q or of Σ∗). The natural topology on C is generated by the cylinders Cx = {ω | x ± ω}, where x ∈ Σ∗. A function



f : Σ∗ ∪ C → R is called lower semicomputable if its graph S = {(ω, q) | ω ∈ Σ∗ ∪ C and q ∈ Q ,q < f (ω)} is a union of a computably enumerable sequence of intervals in the natural topology on Q×Σ∗. The function f is lower semicomputable, if for any rational number q and any finite string w, the assertion q < f (ω) is true can be verified in a computable manner.
We prove an equivalent notion of lower semicomputability:
Lemma 2.1 The following hold.
A function f : C → R is lower semicomputable if and only if there exists a computable function fˆ : Σ∗ × 0N → Q ∪ {−∞, ∞} such that the following hold: For all ω ∈ C,

Monotonicity: For all m, n ∈ N,
fˆ(ω[0 ... m − 1], 0n) ≤
fˆ(ω[0 ... m −

1], 0n+1) ≤ f (ω), and fˆ(ω[0 ... m − 1], 0n) ≤ fˆ(ω[0 ... m], 0n) ≤ f (ω).
Convergence: We have


lim
n→∞
fˆ(ω[0 ... n − 1], 0n)= f (ω).



f : Σ∗ → R is lower semicomputable if and only if there exists a function
fˆ : Σ∗ × 0N → Q ∪ {−∞, ∞} such that the following hold: For all x ∈ Σ∗, a’. Monotonicity: For all n ∈ N, fˆ(x, 0n) ≤ fˆ(x, 0n+1) ≤ f (x).
b’. Convergence: limn→∞ fˆ(x, 0n)= f (x).

Proof. The characterization for the case when f is defined on the domain Σ∗ is standard in the literature (see [10]), and we prove the formulation for the case when the domain is C.
For the case when f : C → R is lower semicomputable, first assume that the set S = {(ω, q) | ω ∈ C,q ∈ Q,f (ω) > q} is the union of a computable enumeration S : 0N → Σ∗ × (Q ∪ {−∞}) of cylinders in the natural topology on C × Q. The projection functions π1 : Σ∗ ×Q → Σ∗ and π2 : Σ∗×Q → Q are defined as π1(w, q)= 
w and π2(w, q)= q. We design a witness function fˆ : Σ∗ × 0N → Q ∪ {−∞} in the
following algorithm.
Algorithm 1 procedure fˆ(w, 0n)
Set ← {−∞}.
i ← 0.
while (i ≤ n)
if (π1(S(i)) ± w)
Set ← Set ∪ π2(S(i))
end if
i ← i + 1.
end while
return max(Set)
end procedure
The monotonicity condition is satisfied, because in the algorithm, for every n,

the sets have the following relationships.
{π2(S(i)) | π1(S(i)) ± w, 0 ≤ i ≤ n}⊆ {π2(S(i)) | π1(S(i)) ± w, 0 ≤ i ≤ n + 1}, and, for strings w' and w, if w' ± w, then
{π2(S(i)) | π1(S(i)) ± w', 0 ≤ i ≤ n}⊆ {π2(S(i)) | π1(S(i)) ± w, 0 ≤ i ≤ n}.

For the convergence, it is obvious that

lim
n→∞
f (ω[0 ... n − 1], 0n)	(2)

exists, since it is a monotone bounded sequence in a compact space. To see that the limit is f (ω), assume that the limit (2) is r < f (ω). Then there exists an r' such that r < r' < f (ω) such that no pair (w, r') where w is some prefix of ω occurs in the enumeration of S. This is a contradiction. Hence the condition is satisfied, and limit (2) is f (ω).
Conversely, let f : C → R be a lower semicomputable function with witness fˆ : Σ∗ × 0N → Q satisfying lower semicomputability conditions. We prove that the set S = {(ω, r) : r ∈ Q,r < f (ω)} is the union of a computable enumeration of cylinders in C × Q.
We show that for every r ∈ Q, r < f (ω), there is a prefix w of ω, such that (w, r) is accepted by an algorithm. This is routine to see, since, we can dovetail the execution of fˆ on Σ∗ × 0N. If r < f (ω), there is an r' > r such that fˆ produces r' on some prefix w and some 0m, and then we can accept (w, r).	 
A function f is called upper semicomputable if −f is lower semicomputable. A function f is called computable if it is both lower and upper semicomputable. This may be seen to be equivalent to the following definition in the case of functions defined over Σ∗.
Definition 2.2 A function f : Σ∗ → R is said to be computable if there exists a function fˆ : Σ∗ × 0N → Q such that for every n ∈ N and every x ∈ Σ∗,
|fˆ(x, 0n) − f (x)| ≤ 2−n.
Note 1 It is easy to show that if fˆ is a witness function to the computability of f, then for all n, fˆ(x, 0n) − 2.2−n is a lower semicomputation, and fˆ(x, 0n)+ 2.2−n is an upper semi-computation of f.

Effective Randomness
Let (Ω, F,P ) be the probability space, where Ω is the sample space, F is the Borel σ-algebra (members of F are the events), and P : F → [0, 1] is the probability. We will be concerned with the sample space Ω = C, the set of all infinite binary sequences. F is the σ-algebra generated by the cylinders Cx = {ω | ω ∈ C,x ± ω}.

Definition 3.1 A probability measure P defined on the Cantor Space of infinite binary sequences is characterized by the following:
P (λ)= 1.
For every string w, 0 ≤ P (w)= P (w0) + P (w1).
A probability measure P : 2Ω → [0, 1] is called computable if the probability measure P : Σ∗ → [0, 1] is a computable function. The notatation P (w) for a string w ∈ Σ∗ stands for P (Cw), the probability of the cylinder Cw.
To define the notion of Martin-Lo¨f random sequences, we introduce two concepts – that of a measure of impossibility, and that of martingales.
Definition 3.2 A function p : Ω → R+ is called a measure of impossibility with respect to the probability space (Ω, F,P ) if the following hold:
P1. p is lower semicomputable.
P2. EP p ≤ 1, where EP f is the expectation of the function f with respect to probability measure P .
A measure of impossibility p of ω with respect to the computable probability distribution P denotes whether ω is random with respect to the given probability distribution or not. In particular, we can see that p(ω) < ∞ if ω is random with respect to the probability distribution P [18].
Definition 3.3 Let ω ∈ C. Then ω is said to be P -impossible if p(ω)= ∞. A set
X ⊆ C is said to be P -impossible as witnessed by p, if
X ⊆ {ω : ω is P -impossible}.
V’yugin and Vovk [18] proved that there is an optimal mesure of impossibility p˜ : C → R+ such that a sequence ω is P -random if and only if p˜(ω) < ∞. The set of Martin-Lo¨f random sequences with respect to P is exactly the complement of the set of all ω ∈ C that are P -impossible.
We also consider martingales.
Definition 3.4 A P -martingale d : Σ∗ → R+, is a function which obeys the prop- erties,
M1. d(λ) ≤ 1.
M2. For all strings w, the following holds:
d(w)P (w)= d(w0)P (w0) + d(w1)P (w1).
A martingale is said to “succeed” on sequence ω if
lim sup d(ω[0 ... n − 1]) = ∞.
n→∞
A martingale is said to “strongly succeed” on sequence ω if
lim inf d(ω[0 ... n − 1]) = ∞.
n→∞

The success set of a martingale d, denoted S∞[d], is defined to be the set of binary sequences on which d succeeds. The strong success set of a martingale d, denoted S∞ [d], is the set of binary sequences on which d strongly succeeds.
A constructive martingale is a lower semicomputable martingale.
We show, the concept of a measure of impossibility and that of a constructive supermartingale are equivalent, in that every measure of impossibility p corresponds to a super-martingale which wins on an ω if and only if p(ω) = ∞. Since there is a universal supermartingale which succeeds on the set of non-random sequences, and there is a universal measure of impossibility which attains ∞ on the set of non-random sequences, it is indirectly known that there is a conversion between the success criteria of martingales and that of measures of impossibility. The new result here is a direct conversion of a supermartingale into a measure of impossibility and vice versa, such that the success sets of both are the same (under some assumptions on the probability measure).

Converting a Martingale into a Measure of Impossi- bility
Let P be a computable probability measure. We wish to convert a lower semi- computable P -martingale which succeeds on a constructive P -measure-zero set, to a measure of impossibility p : C → R+ with respect to P , such that S∞[d] is P -impossible as witnessed by p. We show that if d : Σ∗ → R+ is a lower semicom- putable P -martingale, then there exists a measure of impossibility p :Ω → R+ such
that ∀ω ∈ Ω lim supn→∞ d(ω[0 ... n − 1]) = ∞ only if p(ω)= ∞, and both are less
than ∞ otherwise.
We proceed in stages.
It is well-known that a sequence ω is non-random if and only if there is a mar- tingale d which is such that lim infn d(ω[0 ... n − 1]) = ∞. The following well-known lemma is stated here because we use the construction to prove results about the measure of impossibility.
Lemma 4.1 (Folk) If d : Σ∗ → R+ is a constructive martingale such that ω ∈ S∞[d], then there is a constructive martingale d' : Σ∗ → R+ such that ω ∈ S∞ [d']. Moreover, d' = bc + sa where bc, sa : Σ∗ → R+ are such that bc is non-negative and sa monotone increasing and non-negative.
Proof (Sketch) For every w ∈ Σ∗, let d'(w)= bc(w)+ sa(w) where bc(w) (“bet- ting capital”) and sa(w) (“savings account”) are defined as follows.
For d'(λ), we set bc(λ)= d'(λ) and sa(λ)= 0.
Let d(w1) = αd(w), and d(w0) = (α + (1−α)P (w) ), where α ∈ [0, 1/P (w1)]. Then
d' bets
bc(w)α

on w1, and
bc(w)(α + (1 − α)P (w) )
P (w0)
on w0. Then, for b ∈ {0, 1}, bc(wb) is decremented by 1 if it exceeds 2, and sa(wb) is incremented by 1. Otherwise, sa(w0) = sa(w1) = sa(w). This is taken as the new betting capital and savings account on wb. It is routine to verify that d' is a constructive martingale if d is.
Note that sa is a monotone increasing function in the length of the string, such that sa(w) ≤ d'(w).
Let ω ∈ C. Then lim supn→∞ d(ω[0 ... n − 1]) = ∞ implies that for every integer
m, there is an n > m such that  d(ω[0...n−1]) > 2. This implies that sa(ω[0 ... n − 1])
increments by 1 for infinitely many n. Thus, lim infn→∞ d'(ω[0 ... n − 1]) = ∞, so
ω is in the strong success set of d'.	 

Let d = bc+sa be a P -martingale as defined above. The measure of impossibility
p is defined as follows.

p(ω) = lim sa(ω[0 ... n − 1]).	(3)
n

We prove that p is a measure of impossibility which attains ∞ on all sequences on which d strongly succeeds.
Lemma 4.2 p deﬁned in (3) is a measure of impossibility.
Proof. Let d be lower computable with dˆas witness, and let sˆa be the witness of the lower semicomputability of sa. Then sˆa witnesses that p is lower semicomputable.
Moreover,
EP p = ∫ p(ω)dP


≤ lim inf
n→∞
w'∈Σ{0,1}n
∫ sa(w')dP

= lim	Σ	∫ sa(w')dP,
n→∞ w'∈{0,1}n
by Fatou’s Lemma. But, since sa(w') ≤ d(w') for all w', it follows by Kraft’s inequal- ity that w'∈{0,1}n sa(w')dP ≤ 1 for all n. Hence it follows that p(ω)dP ≤ 1. Therefore p defines a measure of impossibility.	 

It is clear that, since lim infn→∞ d'(ω[0 ... n−1]) = ∞ implies that supn sa(ω[0 ... n− 1]) = ∞, we have p(ω)= ∞. Thus p satisfies the conditions of being a measure of impossibility which attains ∞ on ω.

Converting a Measure of Impossibility into a Martin- gale
We assume P : F → [0, 1] is a computable probability measure. If p : Ω → R+ is a measure of impossibility, we prove: there exists a constructive martingale d : Σ∗ → R+  such that d succeeds on every ω on which p assumes ∞– i.e.
{ω : lim supn→∞ d(ω[0 ... n − 1]) = ∞} ⊇ {ω : p(ω) = ∞}, with equality if P is
a measure which assigns positive probability to every cylinder. In the following discussion, P is a probability measure, p is a measure of impossibility, d is a P - martingale, each of the types described in this paragraph.
We make the following restrictions: We ensure that P is not just a computable probability measure, but also very strongly positive: if Pˆ testifies to the fact that P is computable, then there exists a program f : Σ∗ × 0N → Q such that for every cylinder Cx, the probability of the cylinder P (Cx) > 0 if and only if for all positive integers n, we have Pˆ(x, 0n) > f (x, 0n).
We define the P -martingale d.
For the empty string, d(λ)= EP [p]. For all strings w, and b ∈ {0, 1},


d(wb)=	EP [p | Cwb]	if P (Cwb) > 0 2 · d(w)	otherwise.
(4)

Lemma 5.1 If p is a measure of impossibility with respect to a very strongly posi- tive, computable probability measure P, then d deﬁned in (4), is a lower semicom- putable P-martingale.
Proof. We show that d is a P -martingale, and d is lower semicomputable,
d is a P -martingale:
R p(ω)dP
We have d(λ)= ΩP (Ω)  ≤ 1.
For a string w, if all of Cw, Cw0 and Cw1 have non-zero probability, then the stipulation (M2) is satisfied by linearity of expectation. If, P (Cw) /= 0, but one of P (Cw0), P (Cw1) is zero, without loss of generality, say P (Cw0)= 0, then
d(w0)P (Cw0)+ d(w1)P (Cw1)= 2d(w) × 0+ E[p|Cw1]P [Cw1]
= E[p|Cw1]P (Cw)= E[p|Cw]P (Cw)
= d(w)P (Cw).

d is lower semicomputable:
Consider the following program: Algorithm for dˆ: Σ∗ × N → Q:
Input xb ∈ Σ∗(b ∈ Σ) and n ∈ N.
If f (xb, 0n) > Pˆ(xb, 0n), then dˆ(xb, 0n)= 2 dˆ(x, 0n).
Else,


dˆ(xb, 0n)= 
w∈{0,1}n maxy±xbw{pˆ(y, 0n)}× (Pˆ(xbw, 02n+1) − 2 · 2−2n−1)
P (xb, 02n+1)+ 2 · 2−2n−1	.

To show that dˆ(xb, ·) is a lower semicomputation of d(xb), we proceed as follows. We prove that the numerator in line 3 converges to the appropriate limit. From this, it follows that the output of the program converges to the value of d for the given string xb from below in a lower semicomputable way.


Define the following:

∗	xb0∞
m
w∈{0,1}m
∗	xb0∞
m
w∈{0,1}m


max {pˆ(y, 0m)} Pˆ(xbw, 02m+1) − 2 · 2−2m−1
y±xbw

max {pˆ(y, 0m)}P (xbw)
y±xbw


The following claims suffice to prove that dˆ : N × Σ∗ → Q is a lower semicom- putation of d.


Lemma 5.2 ∀m ∈ N fxb0∞

≤ Sxb0∞
≤ ∫Cxb
p(ω) dP.


Proof (Sketch) Lower semicomputability of P with witness Pˆ(·, 0m) − 2.2−m for all m ∈ N implies the first inequality. The second is by the lower semicomputability of pˆ with respect to p, and the fact that each Sx0∞ is the integral of a step function defined on Ω, pˆ < p (everywhere), and by the definition of the Lebesgue integral. 

Now, we show that the sum converges as n →∞ to the required integral:

Lemma 5.3 The series fxb0∞ converges uniformly to the same limit as of the sum

series Sxb0∞
m
as m → ∞.


Proof. By the computability witness Pˆ of P , we have, for any xbw, m ∈ N,



whereby
P (xbw) − Pˆ(xbw, 02(m+1)) <	1	,
2(2m+1)



|fxb0∞ − Sxb0∞ | <	1
× 2m


m	m	22m+1 1
= 2m+1


The fact that Sxb0∞ → ∫


Cxb
p(ω)dP as m → ∞, follows due to the fact that pˆ

is a lower semicomputation of p. Property (1) of lower semicomputability ensures

that p dominates the step function summed in Sxb0∞ . The convergence property
m	∞
of lower semicomputability ensures that the the function Sxb0	converges to the
integral ∫ pdP .
These claims suffice to establish the condition that dˆ has to satisfy to be a lower semicomputation of d.


Lemma 5.4 For any ω ∈ C, p(ω)= ∞ implies lim supn→∞ d(ω[0 → n − 1]) = ∞.
Proof. First, if P (Cω[0...n−1])=0 for some n, this is routine to prove.
So, assume for all n, P (Cω[0...n−1]) > 0, so that for all n, d(ω[0 ... n − 1]) = E[p|Cω[0...n−1]]. We show that d succeeds on ω. It is enough to show that for every rational q, there is some x ± ω such that d(x) > q.
Let S be the graph of p, described by the union of a computable enumeration C of cylinders in C × Q. If p(ω)= ∞, then there is an (x, q) ∈C for every q ∈ Q such that x is some prefix of ω. If this is so, then for every σ ∈ Cx, p(σ) > q, whence E[p|Cx] > q, which proves the result.	 

A New Characterization of Constructive Dimension
We limit ourselves to computable, and strongly positive probability measures P which assign positive probability to every cylinder Cw. For s ∈ [0, ∞), we introduce the notion of a set being s-improbable with respect to a measure of impossibility.
Definition 6.1 Let X ⊆ C. We say that X is s-improbable with respect to a
P -measure of impossibility p : C → R+ if for every infinite binary sequence ω ∈ X,
we have
∫Cω[0...n−1] p(ω)dP

lim sup

X is strongly s-improbable if

)



lim inf
Cω[0...n−1] p(ω)dP
s

= ∞.	(6)

n→∞
P (Cω[0...n−1])

The concept of s-improbability generalizes the concept of improbability.
Lemma 6.2 Let p : C → R+ be a P-measure of impossibility.
RC	p(ω)dP

For any ω ∈ C, if p(ω)= ∞, then lim supn→∞
  ω[0...n−1]	
P (Cω[0...n−1])

RC	p(ω)dP

For any ω ∈ C, if lim supn→∞
  ω[0...n−1]	
P (Cω[0...n−1] )
= ∞, then there exists a P-

measure of impossibility p' : C → R+ such that p'(ω)= ∞.

Proof. 1.) Let ω ∈ C be such that p(ω)= ∞. Since p is lower semicomputable and
P (Cw) > 0 for all strings w, the function d : Σ∗ → R+ defined by d(w)= EP [p|Cw]
RC	p(ω)dP

is a martingale, such that ω ∈ S∞[d]. Thus, lim supn→∞
  ω[0...n−1]	
P (Cω[0...n−1])

2.) Since ∫ p(ω)dP ≤ 1 and P (Cw) > 0 for all w, we take the equivalent

characterization that supn


  ω[0...n−1]	
P (Cω[0...n−1] )
= ∞. Since p is lowersemicomputable

and P is computable, f '
: C → R+
defined by f '(ω)= supn
RC	p(ω)dP
ω[0...n−1]
P (Cω[0...n−1] )

a measure of impossibility. Hence the optimal measure p˜ attains infinity on any ω
where f '(ω)= ∞.	 
We now review the notion of a lower semicomputable s-P -gale, which, following Lutz [10], we use to give a definition of constructive Hausdorff (or constructive Billingsley) dimension.
Definition 6.3 (Lutz [10]) Let s ∈ [0, ∞). An s-P -gale d : Σ∗ → R+ is a function that satisfies the condition for all w ∈ Σ∗,
d(w)Ps(w)= [d(w0)P s(w0) + d(w1)P s(w1)]	(7)
Definition 6.4 (Lutz [10]) Let d be an s-P -gale, where s ∈ [0, ∞).
We say that d succeeds on ω ∈ C if
lim sup d(ω[0 ... n − 1]) = ∞.
n→∞
The success set of d is
S∞[d]= {ω ∈ C | d succeeds on ω}.
We say that d strongly succeeds on ω ∈ C if
lim inf d(ω[0 ... n − 1]) = ∞.
n→∞
The strong success set of d is
S∞ [d]= {ω ∈ C | d strongly succeeds on ω}.

The notion of Billingsley dimension is outlined in Hausdorff’s work on Hausdorff dimension[3]. The notion of constructive Hausdorff dimension is a constructive ana- logue of Hausdorff dimension where the covers of a set is defined to be constructive. We use the equivalent definition given in Lutz [10], which uses constructive s-P - gales.
Remark 6.5 [Lutz [10]] For every s ∈ [0, ∞), the function d : Σ∗ → R+ is a P -s- gale if and only if the function d' : Σ∗ → R+ defined by d'(w)= P (s−1)(w)d(w) is a martingale.

Definition 6.6 (Lutz [10]) The constructive Hausdorff dimension of a set X ⊆ C
is
dimH(X)= inf{s ∈ [0, ∞) |  There is a constructive s-P -gale for which X ⊆ S∞[d].}
Analogously, the notion of constructive packing dimension is defined as the con- structive analogue of the classical packing dimension [16], [15]. We use the following equivalent notion defined using strong success of s-P -gales.
Definition 6.7 (Athreya et al. [1]) The constructive packing dimension of a set
X ⊆ C is
DimH(X)= inf{s ∈ [0, ∞) |  There is a constructive s-P -gale for which X ⊆ S∞ [d].}
Notation. For X ⊆ C, let G(X) be the set of all s ∈ [0, ∞) such that there is an s-P -gale d for which X ⊆ S∞[d] and P(X) be the set of all s ∈ [0, ∞) such that X is s-improbable with respect to some P -measure of impossibility. Similarly, let Gstr(X) be the set of all s ∈ [0, ∞) such that there is an s-P -gale d for which X ⊆ S∞ [d] and Pstr(X) be the set of all s ∈ [0, ∞) such that X is strongly s-improbable with respect to some P -measure of impossibility.
Lemma 6.8 Let X ⊆ C and s ∈ [0, ∞). Then s ∈ G(X) if and only if s ∈ P(X), and s ∈ Gstr(X) if and only if s ∈ Pstr(X).
Proof. First, assume s ∈ G(X). Then there is an s-P -gale d such that d succeeds on every ω ∈ X. As in the case of constructive martingales, we can form another s-P -gale d' consisting of bc and sa such that the following hold.
For all strings w, d'(w)= bc(w)+ sa(w).
bc(λ)= 1.
sa(λ)= 0.
If d bets αd(w) on w1, and ( (1−α)P s (Cw ) + α)d(w) on w0, then d' bets the same
0s
ratio αbc(w) on w1, and ( (1−α)P (Cw ) + α)bc(w) on w0. If for b ∈ {0, 1} the capital
0
on wb is greater than 2, say 2 + c, then bc(wb) is set to 1, and the new value of the
savings account is set to sa(w)+1 + c. It is routine to verify that d' is a s-P -gale. Unlike the martingale case, we cannot say that sa(w) is monotone increasing in
the length of w. However, we can use the remark previously noted, to construct a martingale d˜, which for every w is defined as bc(w)Ps−1(Cw)+ sa(w)Ps−1(Cw). We can see that sa(w)Ps−1(w) is monotone increasing with the length of w.
We define p : Σ∗ → R+ by
p(w)= sa(w)Ps−1(Cw),
for finite strings w.
Now, we define p : C → R+ by

p(ω) = lim
n→∞
p(ω[0 ... n − 1]).

If d is lower semicomputable, it is routine to see that p is a measure of impossibility.

Also,


Cw p(ω)dP Ps(Cw)


= sa(w)

for all strings w. Since bc(w) is always finite, we have that
lim sup d(ω[0 ... n − 1]) = ∞≡ lim sup sa(ω[0 ... n − 1]) = ∞,
n→∞	n→∞


and

lim inf d(ω[0 ... n − 1]) = ∞≡ lim inf sa(ω[0 ... n − 1]) = ∞.

Hence
n→∞
n→∞

∫Cω[0...n−1] p(ω)dP



n→∞
and

n→∞	P (Cω[0...n−1])
∫Cω[0...n−1] p(ω)dP


	

Thus s ∈ Pstr(X) if s ∈ Gstr(X), and s ∈ P(X) if s ∈ G(X).
Conversely, let s ∈ P(X). Then there exists a measure of impossibility p such that X is s-improbable with respect to p. We define a martingale d : Σ∗ → R+ as follows. For finite strings w,
d(w)= EP [p|Cw]Ps−1(Cw).
It is routine to see that d is a lowersemicomputable s-P -gale. Moreover,
∫Cω[0...n−1] pdP


Thus, we can see that s ∈ G(X). Similarly, we can establish that if s ∈ Pstr(X), then s ∈ Gstr(X).	 
Using this, we can characterize effective Hausdorff and packing dimensions in the following way.
Corollary 6.9 (Alternate Characterization of Constructive Dimension) For any set X ⊆ C, the constructive Hausdorff dimension of X = inf P(X), and the con- structive packing dimension of X = inf Pstr(X).
