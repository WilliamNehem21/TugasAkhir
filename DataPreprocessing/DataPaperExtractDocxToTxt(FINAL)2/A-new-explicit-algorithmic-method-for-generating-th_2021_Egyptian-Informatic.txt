This paper presents a new method for generating all prime numbers up to a particular number m ∈ N; m P 9; by using the set theory. The proposed method is explicit and works oriented in finding the prime numbers in order. Also, we give an efficiently computable explicit formula which exactly deter- mines the number of primes up to a particular number m ∈ N; m P 9. For the best of our knowledge, this is the first exact formula given in literature. For the sake of comparison, a unified framework is done not
only for obtaining explicit formulas for the well-known sieves of Eratosthenes and Sundaram but also for
obtaining exact closed form expression for the number of generated primes using these two sieve meth- ods up to a particular number m ∈ N; m P 9. In addition, the execution times are calculated for the three methods and indicate that our proposed method gives a superior performance in generating the primes.

Introduction

Number theory has many increasingly important applications in computer science and cryptography [1]. One of the central topics of number theory is the prime numbers. The prime numbers are natural numbers greater than 1, which have no positive divisors other than 1 and itself but the natural numbers greater than 1 that are not prime are called composite numbers.
Generating prime numbers by using sieving methods has played a vital role in applied number theory. There are two well- known approaches for draining the composite numbers and leav- ing the prime numbers by sieving namely, the sieves of Eratos- thenes and Sundaram [2] that have been used for obtaining all prime numbers up to a particular number.
In this study, we propose a direct method which depends on the concepts of the sets to generate all the prime numbers in order. Moreover, it is well-known that the prime numbers theorem [2] approximately gives number of primes and which stated that if
p(x) denotes the number of primes up to a particular number x
pose a unified framework for obtaining explicit formulas for both the sieves of Eratosthenes and Sundaram. Also, exact explicit closed form formulas for the generated primes using these two sieves methods are obtained.
The reset of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, the proposed method for generating the prime numbers is given along with its algorithm. In Section 3, a unified framework is proposed to obtain the sieves of Eratosthenes and Sundaram using our pro- posed method. Conclusion is summarized in Section 4.

The proposed method

We use set theory [3] to generate the prime numbers up to a particular number m  N; m P 9; the proposed method is given by the following theorem:

Let P(m) be the set of primes up to a particular number
m ∈ N; m P 9.	If	A ={(2i +1)(2i +1+2n ): n = 0; 1; 2; 3;

Proof:
Firstly, it must be noted that ni determines number of generated elements in the set Ai, and i determines number of generated sets from the set Ai.
Since max(n	) = jm—(2 k+3 2 k < 0, then min(n	) < 0 which
Since B = (B — A) ∪ A and (B — A) ∩ A = u, then
|B| = |B — A| + |A| ⇒ |B — A| = |B| — |A|.	(1.12)
Substitution from (1.12) in (1.11) gives

shows no generated elements in the set Ak+1 because nk+1does not satisfy the condition on ni as stated in the set Ai. This gives


This proves the third requirement and hence the proof is

Ak+1 = u. This proves the first requirement.
Since  max(ni)decreases  with  increasing  i  and  the  set
Ak+1 = u, then the set Akcontains at least one element and this satisfies only when max(nk) = min(nk) = 0. Consequently,

Then the set of odd composite numbers A can be defined as follows:
A = {9 6 c 6 m : c is an odd composite number}	(1.1)

Suppose C C B and P C B which are defined as follows:
C = {9 6 c 6 m : c is an odd composite number}.	(1.2)
And
P = {3 6 p 6 m : p is a prime number}.	(1.3)
Then B can be written as follows:
B = C ∪ P,	(1.4)
Also, P(m) as stated can be defined as follows:
P(m) = {2 6 p 6 m : p is a prime number}.	(1.5)
It is clear from (1.1) and (1.2) that A = C Hence, (1.4) becomes
B = A ∪ P.	(1.6)
Moreover, it is clear from (1.2) and (1.3) that C  P	u.
Therefor
A ∩ P = u.	(1.7)
From (1.6) and (1.7), we have

Also, it is clear from (1.3) and (1.5) that
P(m) = {2} ∪ P.	(1.9)
Substitution from (1.8) in (1.9), we obtain
P(m) = {2} ∪ (B — A).	(1.10)
This proves the second requirement. Since (B — A) ∩ {2} = u, then (1.10) gives

 P(m) = |{2}| + |B — A| = 1 + |B — A|.	(1.11)

A unified framework

For the sake of comparison with our proposed technique for generating primes, we proposed a unified framework to obtain the well-known sieving methods, namely the sieves of Eratos- thenes and Sundaram.

Proposed technique for obtaining the sieve of Eratosthenes

In order to obtain the sieve of Eratosthenes using our proposed method for generating all primes up to a particular number,
m ∈ N, m P 9, we perform the following steps:

Step 1: Let BE be the set of numbers less than or equal a partic- ular number m, i.e.
BE = {j + 1 : j = 1, 2, 3, .. . , m — 1}.

Step 2: Let CE be the set of even numbers greater than two and less than or equal a particular number m, i.e.
CE = n2l : l = 2, 3, ..., jmk o.
Step 3: Generate the set AE where
AE = (2 i + 1)(2 ni + 1) : ni = 1, 2, .. . , ,m — (2i + 1), ,

Moreover, Table 1 gives the number of generated sets (k) which
is used to generate the prime numbers and execution times for the three methods versus a particular number m N, m P 9. It is clear that the proposed method uses less number of generated sets and
less runtimes than the other methods. The results are illustrated in Fig. 1 which indicate the superior performance of our method in obtaining the prime numbers.

Conclusion

In this paper, an explicit and direct technique for generating the primes is given. This technique depends on the sets and Floor func-
thenes and Sundaram using our proposed method. The execution times are calculated for the three methods and indicate that the proposed method is more efficient in obtaining the primes in order.
