Microorganisms have an effective capability to degrade synthetic dyestuff enzymatically. In this study, two 16S rRNA identified Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacterial isolates (ASU3 and ASU6) have been screened to enzymatically degrade both Disperse Blue 64 (DB64) and Acid Yellow 17 (AY17) which resembles 2 of the synthetic dyes that causes aquatic environmental pollution. The expression of the azoR1 gene has been detected in the strains, the degradation percentage of DB64 and AY17 by stain ASU6 was found to exceed the ASU3. This returned to the differences in the expression levels of azoR1 between the ASU6 and the ASU3 which was confirmed by RT-PCR. In addition, the specific activity (U/mg protein) of azoreductase in ASU6 was higher than ASU3 when MethylRed (MR), DB64 and AY17 were used as a substrate, separately. The azoreductase kinetics was studied to find the optimum condition for maintain- ing the stability of the enzyme. The degraded products separated by HPLC/MS were tested for their tox- icity on two crop plants and they were nontoxic to the plants.

Introduction

Most of the colored substances present in the environment and resistant to decomposition by light, water, chemicals and microbial activity are identified as synthetic dyes [1,2]. Azodyes are a large group of aromatic compounds that consist of one or more chro- mophoric azo group (AN@N) that are present in the water body due to many industrial activities and causes aquatic environmental pollutants. Disperse blue (DB64) is an anthraquinone dye represent the second most important class of commercial dyes which mainly used for dyeing wool, polyamide and leather [3]. Acid Yellow 17 (AY17) is a commercial organic azodye that have a genotoxic effect [4]. They cause skin irritation, allergy [5], mutagenicity and car- cinogenicity [6] in humans. Many strategies have been developed to remove the industrial dyes from the water body, such as chem- ical oxidation and reduction [7], adsorption [8] and membrane fil- tration [9], photo-catalytic degradation [10], coagulation and precipitation [11], electrocogulation [12], photoelectrocatalysis
[13] and electrochemical oxidation [14]. Unfortunately, these strategies are expensive and may produce toxic products [2]. On

the other hand, Using of microorganisms to remove these dyes are fast [15,16], inexpensive, and the end products are safe [17].
Different microorganisms, including bacteria [18–20], fungi [21,22] algae [23,24], are able to remove different type dye stuff. The removal of the dyes is carried out by different mechanisms. Biosorption on the cell wall due to the presence of different func- tional groups is one way to remove the dyes [16,25]. Another way is the enzymatically microbial degradation by the azodye– catabolic enzymes like azoreductase [26], laccase [27] and peroxi- dase [28]. Azoreductases of microorganisms are favorable for the development of biodegradation systems for azo dyes, because these enzymes catalyze reductive cleavage of azo groups (AN@NA) under mild conditions [29]. However, the aerobic treatment of azo- dyes requires a special aerobic azoreductase system which cat- alyzes the NADH or NAD(P)H-dependent reduction of azo compounds to the corresponding amines [30]. This enzyme could not only reduce the carboxylic bacterial substrate but also it could reduce the sulfonated analogoes. A small number of bacterial spe- cies have been reported to degrade azodyes under aerobic condi- tion such as Bacillus sp. OY1-2 [31]. Pseudomonas [32], Xenophilusazovorans [33], and Sphingomonas sp. [34]. This study aims to: (i) isolate and identify the azodyes- degrading Pseu- domonas species, (ii) detect the azoR1 gene in isolated strains (iii) compare azoreductase activity, kinetics and gene expression at the RNA level.

Materials and methods

Strains isolation

The isolation of the dye decolorizing bacterial species was car- ried out according to Hesham et al. [35] with some modifications. About 10 mL or mg of water effluent or sludge sample, respectively were suspended in 90 ml (MBS) medium. The medium was supple-
mented with 100 mg l—1 of DB64 or AY17 and 0.1% of glucose as a
carbon source. The flasks were incubated on orbital shaker at 150 rpm at 30 °C. After 7 days incubation, an aliquot of 10% enriched cultures were transferred to a new flasks containing 90 ml fresh autoclaved MBS medium supplemented with previ- ously mentioned dyes. This step was repeated five times to attain well-adapted dye decolorizing microorganisms.
To select Pseudomonas dye degrading strains, cultures were transferred to a King A agar medium supplemented with 100 mg l—1 of dye at pH 7.0 and 30 °C. Pseudomonas colonies were individually selected, purified and evaluated for their dye decol-
orizing ability.


Identification of azodye–degrading Pseudomonas spp

Colony-PCR was performed to amplify the 16S rRNA gene using the 27F (5-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3) and 1492R (5-CGGCTA
CCTTGTTACGACTT-3) primers [36]. PCR was programmed as following: 5 min at 95 °C, followed by 35 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C and 1 min at 72 °C and then one cycle of final exten- sion at 72 °C for 10 min. PCR product was then analyzed on 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis and then sequenced in both directions.
The obtained sequences were aligned and compared using the BLAST search tool at the (http://www.pseudomonas.com/). To determine the taxonomic position of the isolate, a phylogenetic tree was constructed by MEGA version 4.0 software.


Measuring azodye degradation by the UV-vis Spectrophotometer

An overnight culture were inoculated in MBS medium supple- mented with 0.1% of glucose and 100 mg l—1of the tested dyes at 30 °C under static condition. The percentage of decolorization was estimated from the following equation [37]:

A0 — At
% of decolorization =  A0  * 100	(1)
where A0; is the initial absorbance of dyes and At is the absorbance of dye at (t) time. The blank sample is the cultivation medium.
For determination the concentration of dye in the medium, standard curves of DB64 and AY17 with different concentrations (5–300 mg l—1) were made.


Crude enzyme extraction

Strains was grown in MBS liquid medium amended with 0.1% glucose and 100 mg l—1of methyl red to enhance the production of azoreductase enzyme. The cells were harvested by centrifuga- tion and suspended in potassium phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH
7.4). The cells were crushed by sonication at 35 amplitude for 2 min (30-s interval) at 4 °C. The homogenate was then centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 30 min under cooling and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube and the pellet was removed. The total protein concentration was determined by Bradford method [38], with bovine serum albumin as standard.
Azoreductase specific activity and substrate specificity

The azoreductase specific activity was assessed by the reduction of methyl red (MR) as the main substrate and oxidation of NADH using a modified procedure described by Zhao et al. [39]. An enzyme assays mixture was prepared by mixing 600 mL phosphate
buffer (50 mM and pH 7.5), 100 mL of dye substrate (50 mM), 100 mL
of the crude enzyme and 200 mL of NADH (200 mM). MR, DB64 and AY17 were used as a specific substrate to determine the specific azoreductase activity and detect substrate specificity.
One unit of azoreductase activity was defined as one microgram of methyl reduced protein per minute per milligram. All enzyme assays were run in triplicate.

Factors affecting on azoreductase stability

Different pHs and temperatures were tested to determine their effect on the azoreductase stability. To determine the pH effect, the NADH and MR buffers was prepared with a range of different pH (from pH 5 to 9), while the acetate buffer was pH 5.5, the phos- phate buffer was pH (6.5–7.5) and Tris-HCl buffer was pH [8–9].
The temperature effect was determined by using variable tem- perature values ranged from 20 to 60 °C during the measurement with the UV-Vis Spectrophotometer. The temperature of all enzymes reaction mixture was adjusted to the desired temperature except the NADH.

Azoreductase kinetics

Different concentrations of MR (ranged from 17 to 3500 mM) were prepared to determine the azoreductase kinetics. All other constituents of reaction mixture were constant. Kinetic values such as Michaelis–Menten constant (K max) and maximal velocity (Vmax) were calculated from Lineweaver–Burk double reciprocal plots [40].

The expression of the azoR1 gene

Reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) technique was used to determine the azoR1 gene expression. RNA was extracted by using SV Total RNA Isolation System (Promega). First-strand cDNA was reverse transcribed from one microgram of total RNA by using First-strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Amersham Biosciences, GE
Healthcare). RT-PCR was performed using (azoR1Fw: 5'-AACAGCG
TTCGCTGGCGATG-3'  and  azoR11Rv:  5'-  AGGGATCGGCGTGG
TTCATC-3') primers which were designed to specifically amplify a 303 bp sequence in the azoR1 gene. PCR conditions were: initial denaturation for 5 min at 95 °C, 36 cycles with 1 min at 94 °C,
40 s at 56 °C, 60 s at 72 °C, and final extension for 10 min at
72 °C. The reaction products were analyzed on 1% agarose gel elec- trophoresis. The intensity of the bands was analyzed using Gene Profiler 4.03 computer software to determine the OD of each band and consequently calculate the concentration of DNA in the band.

Toxicity of metabolic products

The toxicity of the dyes and its metabolic products were deter- mined by acute toxicity test on 2 popular crop plants in Egypt; monocot seed (Triticum aestivum) and dicot seed (Vicia faba). Briefly, the dyes degraded broths were centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 20 min under cooling. The supernatant was collected and ster- ilized by filtering. About 10 plant seeds were germinated in steril-
ized Petri dish and irrigated with dye filtrate (10 mL) at 30 °C for
7 days. Then the germination percentage, the root and shoot length were calculated. A positive and a negative control were included in the experiment. The positive was irrigated with the dyes buffers



without the bacterial treatment while the negative control was irrigated with sterilized distilled water.

Determination of the metabolic products by LC-MS

10 mL of the metabolites were extracted with three equal vol- umes of Ethyl Acetate. The residual extracts were dried over anhy- drous Sodium Sulfate and evaporated with rotary evaporator at 40 °C to 10 ml. The samples were dried in vacuum and stored at
—20 °C until used. The metabolic products were analyzed by Waters
Alliance Acquity UPLC - Xevo G2S-QTof instrument. Extracts were dissolved in 1 ml of 1:1 MeCN:H2O. 10 ml aliquot was taken and diluted with 90 ml 1:1 MeCN: H2O. 2 ml was injected for LC-MS anal- ysis. The LC conditions: A = H2O + 0.1% HCOOH; B = MeCN + 0.1% HCOOH. 5% B–95% B: 0–12 min 95% B: 12–17 min 5% B: 17–
20 min. The flow rate was 0.2 ml/min, column temperature was 40 °C and the Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column, 1.7 mm, 2.1 × 50 mm. The MS conditions: Range: 100–1200 Da, Capillary: 3.5 V, Sam- pling cone: 40 V, Source temperature: 120 °C, Desolvation temper- ature: 200 °C, Cone gas: 25 L/hr, Desolvation: 600 L/hr and MSe: ramp collision energy from 15 to 45 V. The MS detector was per-
formed by electrospray ionization in positive mode [ESI+].

Results and discussion

Azodye–degrading Pseudomonas spp isolation and identification

Twenty Pseudomonas strains were isolated from different textile dye effluent and screened for azodye degrading capability (results are not shown). Two strains ASU3 and ASU6 exhibited hyber azo- dye degrading capability. The strains were identified based on some morphological and biochemical activity using Bergey’s Man- ual of Systematic Bacteriology as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The cell shape was short rods and gram-negative. They showed high growth on the different Pseudomonas selective media like Cetrim- ide, King A and King B and produce green pyocyanin pigment. They are oxidase and catalase positive strains and can oxidize glucose.
Moreover, we used the 16S rRNA gene sequencing to molecu- larly identify the ASU3 and ASU6 strains. The 16S rRNA identifica- tions is more robust, reproducible, accurate and less subjective test results [1,41]. Based on the Blast results and the dendrogram demonstrating the relationship among some Pseudomonas strains



Fig. 1. Dendrogram demonstrating the relationship among the isolated strains (ASU3 and ASU6) and some Pseudomonas strains.
(Fig. 1), ASU6 and ASU3 strains were highly similar to Pseudomonas aeruginosa with a similarity of 97–98%, respectively.

Degradation of azodyes
The capacity of Pseudomonas strains for the decolorization of various dyes has been studied in detail [42] who reported that, the azo dyes (Acid Violet 7, Acid Red 151 and Reactive Black 5) were degraded at higher extent (>90%) than Indigo Carmin, Acid Red 183 (chromium complex) and anthraquinones (Reactive Blue 2 and Acid Green 27). Decolorization of waste waters containing reactive azo dyes was achieved by a culture of the bacteria P. lute- ola that reduced the azo bond in Red G [43].
Using the UV-Vis Spectrophotometer, the degradation percent-
age of each dye was estimated for the two selected strains at the maximum absorbance (kmax) using equation [1]. DB64 and AY17
were monitored at 600, and 398 nm, respectively. Strains ASU3 and ASU6 could degrade 61.2 and 96.8% of DB64 within 48 h and under static condition, respectively. At the same time, they could remove 38.6 and 91.2% of AY17, respectively (Fig. 2).
The results showed that the efficiency of two strains to degrade DB64 was higher than AY17. In addition, the ability of the strain ASU6 to degrade the two distinct types of azodyes exceeded the ability of ASU3.

azoR1 gene expression in isolated strains
To evaluate the effects of different substrate on the transcrip- tion of azoreductase gene, cells were cultured in media supple- mented with 100mg l-1of either DB64, AY17 or MR for 48 h. RNA was directly extracted from cultivated strains after the decoloriza- tion of dye using the SV total RNA Isolation system (Promega). The expression of azoR1 gene was used to detect the activity of the ASU3 and ASU6 strains on the azodyes.
The transcription of azoR1 gene was variable from strain to another and from substrate to other. In this study, the expression of azoR1 gene in strain ASU6 was higher than its expression in ASU3 when they consumed MR and AY17 and the opposite occurred when the DB64 was consumed. When using AY17 as the main substrate, the transcription of azoR1 gene was signifi- cantly weak in the strain ASU6 with lnt OD 1.82 and band concen- tration was about 35.1 ng but it was hardly detected in ASU3; the band concentration was about 12.5 ng (Fig. 3 and Table 1).
Regarding the DB64-containing medium, the two strain exhibit a bright band. Interestingly, the gene expression as well as the band concentration in the strain ASU3 (93.3 ng) was more than ASU6 (63.97 ng). Moreover, the highest expression was detected when the strains were separately cultivated on the medium sup- plemented with MR (212.07 and 98.8 ng for ASU6 and ASU3, respectively) (Fig. 3 and Table 1).
In addition, the transcription of azoR1 seemed to be subjected to the type and chemistry of the dye. The results of gene expression were highly supported the results of azoreductase specific activity and the degradation percentage except with the degradation of DB64. When the DB64 was used as a substrate, the RNA expression of azoR1 gene in strain ASU6 was lower than ASU3. However, the enzyme specific activity and the degradation percentage were higher. The reason of this phenomena may be due to the presence of other co-enzymes or cofactors cooperated to enhance the activ- ity of azoreductase as well as the degradation of the DB64 in strain ASU6 rather than azoR1 encoding azoreductase as mentioned by (1).
Leelakriangsak et al. [44] reported the increase in the expres- sion of genes (ppazoR1, ppazoR2 and ppazoR3) on the mRNA levels in P. aeruginosa. Töwe et al. [45] also observed more significant increases in azoR1 and azoR2 gene expression in Bacillus subtilis in the presence of quinines.

Determination azoreductase specific activity and substrate specificity

Azoreductase is a key enzyme catalyzes the reduction of azo- dyes in versatile microorganisms. This enzyme could be inhibited by oxygen [46]. The specific activity of azoreductase enzyme (U/ mg protein) was monitored for the two strains during the growth of strains on methyl red (MR), DB64 or AY17 as specific substrates in the presence of NADH as the electron donor (oxidative media-
tors). The experiment was carried out under a static condition at 30 °C. The maximum specific activity of ASU3 and ASU6 on differ- ent substrates was summarized in Table 2. The strains recorded highest values of azoreductase specific activity when the MR dye
was applied as a specific substrate (0.92 and 0.3 U/mg protein for ASU6 and ASU3, respectively). On the other hand, the specific activity of azoreductase enzyme was at the lowest value when the AY17 was used. It was observed that, the specific activity of azoreductase producing strain ASU6 higher than strain ASU3. Thus, it could be said that, the specific substrate that will be applied to find the enzyme kinetics was MR.
Due to a competition for consumption of NADH by aerobic res- piration, which make the electron transfer from NADH to oxygen in order to form ATP [47]. Many bacteria possess a specific cytoplas- mic azoreductases system that catalyzed the electron transfer from NADH (electron donor) to azo bonds. So, the presence of NADH is very significant in the reduction of azodyes by aerobic bacteria [46]. Thus, it could be concluded that, the aerobic azoreductase enzyme is an inducible enzyme required redox mediator for per- fect performance. Likewise, that the presence of dyes as substrates stimulate the induction of this enzyme. Azoreductase activity in azodyes decolorizing bacteria has been extensively examined to elucidate azo dye reduction mechanism [30,39,44,48].


Factors affecting azoreductase activity

Azoreductase reaction should take place at optimum condition. The most important condition affecting on the activity of the enzymes is pH and temperature. Hence, it is rattling important to determine the optimal conditions for the operation of enzymes.



The activity of azoreductase was maximum at pH 7.5 for ASU3 and ASU6 at 30 °C (Fig. 4a). Thus, the optimal pH value for azoreductase enzyme was pH 7.5 when MR was used as a specific substrate. While the optimum temperature for azoreductase was at 40 °C for the two strains (Fig. 4b). No significant activity has been observed at 60 °C for strain ASU6. These came in context with many literatures which study the optimum condition for azoreduc- tase [46,47].

Kinetics of azoreductase

Using a different concentration of the substrate (MR) is a main factor to determine the enzyme kinetics. The kinetics parameters like Vmax (maximum velocity) and Km (Michaelis constant) were estimated and the velocity of azoreductase in ASU6 (10.6 mM/
min/mg) was higher than ASU3 (0.5 mM/min/mg). However, the
value Km were 125 and 3240 mM. The low value of km indicated that the affinity of substrate to azoreductase in ASU3 was higher than its affinity in ASU6 (Fig. 5).
Many literatures reported that azoreductase enzyme is not only capable of reduction of azo dyes, but also it could reduce several naphtho-, benzo-, and anthraquinone compounds. In some cases, these compounds act as a better substrate than methyl red due
to higher value of Km and Vmax than MR [49]. The enzyme kinetics in two isolated strains indicated that the velocity Vmax and Km of the enzyme in ASU6 was higher than ASU3. Nevertheless, an enzyme has a low value of km it achieves its maximum catalytic efficiency at low substrate concentrations. ASU3 azoreductase was more effective as a catalyst than ASU6.

Phytotoxicity test

The use of untreated or treated wastewater contaminated with dyes in the land may have a harmful effect on the soil fertility and productivity. Thus, it was important to consider the effect of dyes and its product on two different crop plants. Because the strain ASU6 exhibited higher degradation ability to synthetic dyes than ASU3, it was selected for phytotoxicity studies. The results demon- strated that, the percentages of germination were significantly low when the seeds treated with the crude dyes compared to that trea- ted with the metabolic products. The highest germination percent- age achieved when the DB64 metabolic products were applied on monocot and dicot seeds 87% and 80%, respectively (Table 3). The length of shoot and root was also significantly affected.
The results showed that, the toxicity of dyes and its degradation products on the plant was different according the type and

Metabolic products by HPLC–MS

The metabolic products that produced from the degradation of DB64 by strain ASU6 was analyzed by HPLC–MS for tentative iden- tification of intermediate compounds. The HPLC–MS chro- matogram showed that, there were many tentative products produces after incubation of dye with strain ASU6. Four tentative compounds have a good match with the structure of DB64 that were listed in Table 4. These compounds indicated that the main behavior of the strain ASU6 for degradation of DB64 was the reduc- tion of anthraquinone ring.
The tentative products gave an impression that, there were two expected metabolic pathways (Fig. 6) for degradation of DB64. The first one was that the DB64 can undergo reduction through azore- ductase via two electrons transfer that lead to formation of hydro- quinone (Table 4; No. 4). The subsequent reduction mechanism finally leads to ring cleavage (Table 4; No. 5). The second pathway was to eliminate the methoxy groups from the dye (Table 4; No. 2) and subsequently one of the amino benzene was liberated and the other was hydrated (Table 4; No. 3).
The mechanism of hyrdoquinone formation was that NADH acted as redox mediators which were enzymatically reduced by the cells to form hydroquinones, which in turn reduced the azo dye. The quinine reductase activity was observed in the cell mem- brane and hence the transport of the hydroquinone /quinine redox mediator and the highly polar sulfonated azo dye across the cell membrane was not required.
The metabolites could be detected from the degradation of AY 17(Table 4 & Fig. 6) were only two metabolites (Table 4 No; 7&8) indicating the cleavage of diazo bond and formation of sulfonated aromatic amines.

Conclusion

The percentage of degradation of many dyes is controlled by the type and chemistry of dye and the ability of bacteria to produce the
azoreductase enzyme. The percentage of dye degradation was vari- able within the two isolated strains why the strain ASU3 and ASU6 could degrade anthraquinone dye DB64 with higher efficiency than AY17. May be due to the anthraquinone dyes are easier to degrade than azodyes one or the presence complex structure of AY17 make obstacle its degradation. Other causes may be due to the bacterial azoR1gene expressions in the presence of DB64 was higher than AY17.
Azoreductase is the main enzyme responsible for degradation of DB64 and AY17. When the transcription of azoR1 gene decreases, it led to decrease the azoreductase activity and its velocity toward the substrate and consequently, depletion in the degradation rate. Along the DB64 degradation process by ASU6, four metabolites can be detected that indicated the reduction of the anthraquinone ring by azoreductase. These metabolites were proved to be non-toxic to the crop plants.
