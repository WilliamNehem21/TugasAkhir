SUMMARY

B cell lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is composed of diverse molecular subtypes, and while transcriptional and DNA methylation profiling has been extensively examined, the chromatin landscape is not well characterized for many subtypes. We therefore mapped chromatin accessibility using ATAC-seq in pri- mary B-ALL cells from 156 patients spanning ten molecular subtypes and present this dataset as a resource. Differential chromatin accessibility and transcription factor (TF) footprint profiling were employed and iden- tified B-ALL cell of origin, TF-target gene interactions enriched in B-ALL, and key TFs associated with acces- sible chromatin sites preferentially active in B-ALL. We further identified over 20% of accessible chromatin sites exhibiting strong subtype enrichment and candidate TFs that maintain subtype-specific chromatin ar- chitectures. Over 9,000 genetic variants were uncovered, contributing to variability in chromatin accessibility among patient samples. Our data suggest that distinct chromatin architectures are driven by diverse TFs and inherited genetic variants that promote unique gene-regulatory networks.


INTRODUCTION

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is derived from B and T cell lineage precursor cells and is the most common childhood can- cer.1 A majority of acute lymphoblastic leukemias are derived from B cell lineages (B-ALL) that are comprised of distinct molec- ular subtypes characterized by unique chromosomal lesions, including aneuploidy, translocations, gene fusions, point muta- tions, and other chromosomal rearrangements that drive leuke- mogenesis.2 Numerous studies have identified extensive hetero- geneity in transcriptomes3,4 and DNA methylomes5,6 among B-ALL subtypes in large patient cohorts, but there is limited un-
derstanding of chromatin landscapes. Here we provide an extensive survey of accessible chromatin state and cis-regulato- ry element activity in primary B-ALL cells from more than 150 pa- tients across the United States.
Chromatin accessibility or open chromatin is a hallmark of active cis-regulatory elements that control spatial and temporal gene expression.7 Because ALL typically involves mutations (PAX5-altered), complex rearrangements (e.g., DUX4-rear- ranged, PAX5-altered, ZNF384-rearranged), and/or oncogenic gene fusions (e.g., ETV6::RUNX1, TCF3::PBX1, KMT2A-rear- ranged) of transcription factor (TF) genes, as well as disruptions of cis-regulatory elements,8 chromatin-accessibility maps can

provide valuable information to better understand the leukemo- genic process. Accessible chromatin sites can be mapped using transposases by performing assays for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq).9,10 Although DNase treatment has also been used,11 one key advan- tage of ATAC-seq is the low sample input requirements compared to DNase-based assays. This makes ATAC-seq an attractive assay for mapping open chromatin in primary cells from patients wherein sample availability is limited. Additionally, chromatin accessibility allows for identification of bound TFs through an examination of TF footprints, which are defined by depletion in DNA transposition12 or DNase13 cleavage events within regions of accessible chromatin signal. As a result, the un- derlying TF-binding gene-regulatory networks that promote chromatin accessibility and differential gene expression can be predicted.
Previous large-scale studies of chromatin accessibility in pri- mary cells have predominantly focused on distinct cell types10,14 or distinct tumor types and locations.15,16 Therefore, large-scale analyses aimed at better understanding the chromatin state in a single heterogeneous malignancy are currently lacking. To address this knowledge gap, we mapped chromatin acce- ssibility in fresh primary ALL cells from 156 patients across ten molecular subtypes of B-ALL (BCR::ABL1, DUX4-rearranged, ETV6::RUNX1, high hyperdiploid, low hypodiploid, KMT2A-rear- ranged, BCR::ABL1-like [Ph-like], PAX5-altered, TCF3::PBX1, and ZNF384-rearranged) and B-other patient samples. Notably, these subtypes span the entire spectrum of clinical prognoses, including patients with excellent (DUX4-rearranged, ETV6:: RUNX1, high hyperdiploid), good (TCF3::PBX1), intermediate (ZNF384-rearranged, PAX5-altered), and poor (BCR::ABL1, low hypodiploid, KMT2A-rearranged, Ph-like) prognosis. We also mapped histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) enrich- ment using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP- seq) and performed promoter capture Hi-C in a subset of these patient samples to additionally infer functional activity and candi- date target genes of accessible chromatin sites.
Using ATAC-seq chromatin-accessibility and histone profiling in primary ALL cells, we mapped cis-regulatory element activity in B-ALL. In complement to chromatin-accessibility profiling, we identified thousands of chromatin loops targeting promoters in multiple B-ALL cell lines to better inform linkages of cis-regulato- ry elements to cognate genes. We coupled these maps to TF footprints at accessible chromatin sites to identify key TFs and gene-regulatory networks across B-ALL samples and within distinct B-ALL subtypes. Our results identified extensive chro- matin reprogramming between B cell progenitors and B-ALL as well as extensive heterogeneity in accessible chromatin land- scapes among B-ALL subtypes. Specifically, we uncovered a focused subset of over 42,000 B-ALL open chromatin sites ex- hibiting extensive subtype enrichment and subtype-enriched
TF-binding events. Notably, these sites can predict and classify B-ALL samples with 86% cross-validation accuracy. We addi- tionally explored the impact of inherited genetic variation on the chromatin state and delineated over 9,000 ATAC-seq chro- matin-accessibility quantitative trait loci (ATAC-QTLs) in B-ALL cells, including a subset that alters neighboring gene expression. Using this expansive B-ALL chromatin-accessibility dataset, our data collectively support substantial subtype specificity in chro- matin accessibility that is driven in part by distinct TFs, as well as pronounced inter-individual heterogeneity in chromatin state through inherited genetic variants. Our work further supports the role of these distinct chromatin architectures in establishing unique gene-regulatory networks that impact gene expression and B-ALL cell biology.

RESULTS

Chromatin-accessibility profiles of B-ALL patient samples spanning multiple subtypes
ATAC-seq using the Fast-ATAC10 method was performed on recently harvested primary ALL cells from 156 patients spanning ten B-ALL molecular subtypes (BCR::ABL1, DUX4-rearranged, ETV6::RUNX1, high hyperdiploid, low hypodiploid, KMT2A-rear- ranged, Ph-like, PAX5-altered, TCF3::PBX1, and ZNF384-rear- ranged) and B-other samples (Table S1) from diverse medical centers, research groups, and clinical trials networks across the United States (see STAR Methods). To identify high-confi- dence sites, we identified ATAC-seq peak summits using sub- type-merged data and selected only loci reproducible among unmerged individual patients. Using this approach, we identified 110,468 accessible chromatin sites, on average, in each B-ALL subtype (range 71,797–142,498), with 217,240 merged sites identified in total representing the final B-ALL genomic regions of interest (Figure 1A; Table S2).
Using H3K27ac ChIP-seq data generated from a subset of 11 B-ALL patient samples, as well as primary B-ALL cell H3K27ac, H3K4me1, and H3K27me3 ChIP-seq data from the Blueprint Epi- genome Consortium (https://www.blueprint-epigenome.eu/), we determined that nearly all open chromatin sites mapped to regions containing only active histone marks (H3K27ac and/or H3K4me1, 89.6%; H3K27ac, 3.3%; H3K4me1, 34%; H3K4me1+H3K27ac,
52.3%) or regions with bivalent marks, suggesting a poised chro- matin state (H3K27ac and/or H3K4me1 and H3K27me3, 8.9%), compared to only 1.5% of ATAC-seq sites that mapped to regions solely harboring repressive chromatin (H3K27me3; Figure 1B). Because these histone modifications are typically found at tran- scriptional enhancers and promoters,17–20 these findings suggest that these accessible chromatin regions are B-ALL cis-regulatory elements implicated in gene regulation.
In most cases, these candidate cis-regulatory elements map within intergenic or intragenic loci with unclear gene targets.

Therefore, to better inform gene connectivity, we produced chro- matin looping data using promoter capture Hi-C21 across ten pa- tient samples (BCR-ABL1, ETV6-RUNX1, KMT2A-rearranged, Ph-like, TCF3-PBX1, and B-other subtypes) and seven B-ALL cell lines (697, BALL1, Nalm6, REH, RS4;11, SEM, and SUP- B15) to complement B-ALL patient chromatin-accessibility pro- files. Collectively, across patient samples and B-ALL cell lines we detected approximately 300,000 chromatin loops, with approximately 50% of the 217,240 chromatin-accessible re- gions of interest intersecting with a promoter loop, including 15,929 chromatin-accessible sites that looped to a cancer-impli- cated gene set (Figure 1C).22,23 In many instances, large do- mains of extensive chromatin looping are present, which with chromatin accessibility and active histone marks emphasize the gene-regulatory networks present across B-ALL patient samples (e.g., Figures 1D and 1E).

Chromatin accessibility identifies Pro-B cell of origin for most B-ALL patient samples
To better understand chromatin remodeling during leukemogen- esis, we sought a comparison of chromatin accessibility be- tween B-ALL and B cell progenitors. Moreover, although it is widely accepted that the B-ALL cell of origin is a B cell precursor, exactly which precursor is not always clear, particularly at the chromatin-accessibility level.24 To resolve this uncertainty, we examined publicly available ATAC-seq data from several human B cell progenitors10,25 (Figure 2A). When comparing chromatin- accessibility signal between B cell progenitor groups, we identi- fied a set of approximately 42,344 genomic loci that demonstrate a chromatin-accessibility enrichment or depletion trend for a B cell progenitor (Figure 2B; Table S3; see also STAR Methods). We refer to these chromatin loci as B-progenitor identity loci, due to their distinct patterning across B-progenitor differentia- tion and likely representation of stage-specific gene-regulatory programs.
Next, we examined patient B-ALL cell chromatin accessibility across these B-progenitor identity loci. When plotting chro- matin-accessibility signal as a heatmap comparing B cell pro- genitors and B-ALL patient samples, a high degree of similarity was observed with prePro-B cells and Pro-B cells (Figure 2B). Further, when applying the k-nearest neighbor classification model previously trained on B-progenitor identity loci, the major- ity of B-ALL samples were classified as either prePro-B or Pro-B (Figures 2C and 2D). However, prePro-B cells have been re- ported to be an extremely rare population beyond embryonic and fetal development.25 Overall, Pro-B cells demonstrate the most similarity to B-ALL cells at the chromatin-accessibility level when focusing specifically on B cell precursor defining loci, emphasizing this precursor B cell as a common cell of origin for B-ALL.

Extensive differences in chromatin accessibility between B-ALL and Pro-B cells
To better understand chromatin remodeling during leukemogen- esis, we next compared accessible chromatin sites between B-ALL and Pro-B cells (n = 3) using DESeq2 at the 217,240 merged B-ALL chromatin-accessibility peaks and uncovered 42,661 differentially accessible chromatin sites (DASs) exhibiting
lesser or greater accessibility in B-ALL samples (Figures 3A, 3B, and S1; Table S4). Ontology analysis focusing strictly on DASs with higher chromatin accessibility in B-ALL indicated an en- richment for sites associated with genes involved with Toll-like receptor signaling, interleukin production, metabolism (acetyl- coenzyme A [CoA] production), and cell proliferation (Figure 3C). Enriched ontology terms were frequently present at multiple fold- change thresholds of input B-ALL DASs (Table S5).
In addition to profiling differential chromatin accessibility, global TF binding was also compared between B-ALL and Pro-B cells. To identify differential TF binding, we performed genome-wide TF footprint profiling12 using 810 TF motifs comparing B-ALL patient samples and normal Pro-B cell sam- ples across all B-ALL genomic regions of interest (217,240 re- gions). Differential binding scores indicated the AP-1 family of TFs (e.g., FOS, JUN) as the most prominent TFs with higher bind- ing in B-ALL patient samples compared to normal Pro-B cells (Figure 3D). In contrast, prominent TFs with higher binding in Pro-B cells were those such as TFAP2A, KLF15, CTCFL, ZBTB14, and EBF1.
To further demonstrate AP-1 TF occupancy in B-ALL acces- sible chromatin sites, we performed CUT&RUN for FOSL2, JUN, and JUNB in 697 and SUB15 human B-ALL cell lines (Fig- ures 3E and S2). Collectively, we identified 56,650 (697: FOSL2 = 66,040, JUN = 47,381, JUNB = 4,730) and 61,121 (SUPB15: FOSL2 = 106,961, JUN = 9,971, JUNB = 14,784) AP-1 binding
sites in 697 and SUPB15 cells, respectively, with a final merged AP-1 region set including both 697 and SUPB15 regions of 88,650. Intersections with B-ALL accessible chromatin sites from primary cells using the merged AP-1 regions identified that 28% (61,090) of these sites were occupied by an AP-1 TF in B-ALL cell lines (41,002 sites and 19% of all B-ALL accessible chromatin sites from primary cells in 697; 45,685 sites and 21% of all B-ALL accessible chromatin sites from primary cells in SUPB15). Strikingly, our results further uncovered that 46% of DASs with higher chromatin accessibility in B-ALL (i.e., B-ALL- enriched DASs) also exhibit AP-1 TF occupancy (Figure 3F), thereby supporting the activation of AP-1 TF-associated cis-reg- ulatory in B-ALL. We determined that even though most AP-1- occupied B-ALL-enriched DASs localized to promoter-distal re- gions of the human genome (77%), there is a 2.7-fold enrichment for AP-1 occupancy at B-ALL-enriched promoters compared to B-ALL-enriched DASs devoid of AP-1 occupancy (Figure 3G; 16% vs. 6%). Further integration of AP-1-occupied B-ALL- enriched DASs with promoter capture Hi-C in B-ALL cell lines identified target genes that were enriched for cell cycle, auto- phagy, and apoptotic signaling pathways (Table S6; example in Figure 3H). Select B-ALL-enriched, promoter-distal DASs pre- dicted to be AP-1 bound by TF footprinting within B-ALL patient samples but not Pro-B cells were targeted for CRISPR-Cas9- mediated genomic deletion in B-ALL cell lines (Figure S3). Vali- dating their role as B-ALL cis-regulatory elements, analysis of heterogeneous deletion pools identified effects on neighboring gene expression and cellular proliferation (Figure S4).
As an extension of our TF footprinting data, we also integrated B-ALL patient promoter capture Hi-C using the ABC enhancer algorithm to refine identification of TF-target gene relationships across top TFs and a cancer-implicated gene set.26 Specifically,

we focused on top TF footprints within B-ALL-enriched DASs and the cancer-implicated gene targets of these DASs predicted by the ABC enhancer algorithm. Concordant with global TF foot- print and AP-1 TF occupancy analyses, we identified the AP-1 family as top TFs in this network. We also identified other top TFs from TF footprinting, such as CEBP family TFs and BACH2 (Figure 3I). Other prominent top TFs include NFIC, XBP1, TBX2, and numerous basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) class TFs (e.g., MYOG, MYF5 and HES5). Top expressed cancer-impli- cated gene targets for each TF converged on notable genes involved in cell signaling (SMAD3, PTPRJ), BCL6 regulation (FBXO11, BCOR), and transcriptional regulation (RUNX1, ERG, CUX1) (Figure 3I). Largely consistent results were further ob- tained using promoter capture Hi-C data from B-ALL cell lines (Figure S5). Collectively, these results highlight alterations of signaling pathways and TF-binding networks that facilitate the proliferative potential of B-ALL samples.

Identification of subtype-enriched chromatin architecture
To better understand chromatin accessibility within B-ALL, inter- subtype analyses were performed to identify DASs exhibiting subtype-enriched signal (henceforth referred to as subtype-en- riched DASs) in ten B-ALL molecular subtypes harboring known molecular drivers (BCR::ABL1, DUX4-rearranged, ETV6:: RUNX1, high hyperdiploid, low hypodiploid, KMT2A-rearranged, Ph-like, PAX5-altered, TCF3::PBX1, and ZNF384-rearranged; Figures 4A–4C). For this analysis, we compared a single B-ALL subtype cohort with all other B-ALL cell samples not belonging to that subtype in pairwise fashion covering all subtypes using DESeq2 differential analysis across the 217,240 B-ALL accessible chromatin sites from primary cells. This approach was utilized to emphasize high degrees of subtype enrichment compared to the full spectrum of chromatin-accessibility vari- ability in the remaining sample cohort. We identified between 452 and 10,590 DASs in each B-ALL subtype, with a total of 42,753 subtype-enriched DASs identified across all ten B-ALL subtypes (log2 fold change >1 or <1, false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.05; Figure 4B; Table S7). We annotated subtype-en- riched DASs on a subtype basis and determined that a majority of subtype-enriched DASs in each B-ALL subtype (87%, range 80%–90%) localized to promoter-distal regions of the genome (intronic and distal intergenic; Figure S6) and 43%, on average (range 39%–49%), localized to distal intergenic regions, thereby emphasizing the importance of non-genic loci in defining B-ALL chromatin heterogeneity.
To further evaluate subtype-enriched DASs, we determined whether they displayed enrichment patterns that were consis- tent with five established human B-ALL cell lines (697 = TCF3::PBX1, JIH5 = ZNF384-rearranged, Nalm6 = DUX4-rear-
ranged, REH = ETV6::RUNX1, SEM = KMT2A-rearranged, and SUPB15 = BCR::ABL1). Concordant with DASs in patient sam- ples, subtype-enriched DASs exhibited the strongest (BCR- ABL, DUX4-rearranged, ETV6::RUNX1, KMT2A-rearranged) or second strongest (TCF3::PBX1) accessibility in the concordant cell line that was representative of that subtype (Figure S7). These data suggest that B-ALL cell lines exhibit chromatin accessibility that is largely consistent with the primary B-ALL cell sample from the corresponding subtype.
To further determine functional effects on gene expression, we integrated subtype-enriched DASs with differentially expressed genes (DEGs) uniquely upregulated (log2 fold change > 1, FDR < 0.05) in each of the ten B-ALL molecular subtypes to determine whether they were enriched near DEGs. We identified a statistically significant enrichment of subtype-enriched DASs near upregulated DEGs in nine of ten subtypes compared to total expressed genes in the corresponding subtype and uncovered a strong statistical trend in Ph-like B-ALL (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, p = 0.053; Figure S8). We additionally selected several top differential DAS genomic regions for targeting with the CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) dCas9-KRAB repressor as a test of their effects on neighboring gene expression (Figures 4D and S9). Putative cis-regulatory elements were targeted within a B-ALL cell line context corresponding to the origin of the B-ALL subtype DASs (Nalm6 = DUX4-rearranged, SEM = KMT2A-rearranged). These select DAS regions each demon- strated repression of the corresponding nearby genes (LNX1, MAP7, SENP6) when targeted with a dCas9-KRAB repressor, indicating a genuine cis-regulatory element (Figure 4D). Conse- quently, these data support the role of subtype-enriched DASs in gene regulation and gene activation and further suggest that differences in chromatin accessibility contribute to transcrip- tomic differences among B-ALL subtypes.3,4 Collectively, these results highlight extensive open chromatin heterogeneity among B-ALL molecular subtypes.

Mapping transcription factor drivers and gene- regulatory networks in B-ALL subtypes
We performed TF footprint profiling for 810 TF motifs across all B-ALL chromatin-accessibility sites (N = 217,240) using merged ATAC-seq signal from ten B-ALL subtypes with known molecular drivers to identify subtype-enriched TF drivers. TF footprint profiling12 identified between 4,303,155 and 5,441,937 bound motifs in each B-ALL subtype, with 49,402,067 TF footprints at 815,992 unique genomic loci identified across all subtypes. Us- ing these data, we next identified key TF footprints that were en- riched in each subtype (i.e., subtype-enriched TF footprints) by calculating differential footprint scores between every subtype- subtype pair for each TF motif. The top median differential motif scores for each subtype were selected as subtype-enriched TF

footprints. This approach was utilized to emphasize differential TF footprint motifs that were consistent and distinct for each subtype rather than repetitive global trends (Figure 5A). Notably, subtype-enriched TF footprints were identified for recognized TF drivers such as DUX4 in DUX4-rearranged ALL and ZNF384 in ZNF384-rearranged ALL. We also identified HOX family TFs (HOXA9, HOXB9, HOXC9, and HOXD9) in KMT2A-rearranged ALL, GATA family TFs (GATA2, GATA3, GATA4, GATA5, and
GATA6) in ZNF384-rearranged ALL, and nuclear receptor family TFs (ESR1, ESR2, RARA, and THRB) in PAX5-altered ALL that all had strong subtype-enriched TF footprints.
Because DNA consensus motifs can be highly redundant within TF families, we integrated subtype-enriched TF footprints with DEGs uniquely upregulated in each subtype to identify candidate TFs from these TF families that are upregulated in the corresponding B-ALL subtype. This analysis identified HOXA9 and HOXC9, RARA, and GATA3 as upregulated genes in KMT2A-rearranged, PAX5-altered, and ZNF384-rearranged subtypes, respectively (Figure 5B). In addition, DUX4 (DUX4-re- arranged) and MEIS1 (KMT2A-rearranged) were also identified as upregulated TF genes with subtype-enriched TF footprints (Figure S10).
To determine whether these upregulated TFs promote unique chromatin-accessibility landscapes among B-ALL subtypes, we also performed TF footprinting on subtype-enriched DASs by comparing differential footprint scores between each B-ALL subtype group and non-subtype patient sample group (Figures 5C and S11). These data also supported a role of DUX4 in DUX4-rearranged ALL, ZNF384 and GATA3 in ZNF384-rear- ranged ALL, and HOXA9 and MEIS1 in KMT2A-rearranged ALL in the generation of subtype-specific chromatin landscapes (Fig- ures 5C and S11). Additionally, our subtype versus non-subtype findings for ETV6::RUNX1 further confirm the importance of fac- tors binding GGAA DNA-sequence repeats (EWSR1-FLI1, MA0149.1) as previously characterized for the ETV6::RUNX1 subtype27 (Figure S11). In complement to analysis of subtype- enriched DASs, we also examined TF footprints among sub- type-depleted DASs by again comparing each B-ALL subtype group and non-subtype group. Transcriptional repressors such as ZNF135, ZNF263, ZEB1, and ZEB2 had higher footprint scores across subtype-depleted DASs for multiple subtypes, suggesting a common set of TFs promoting subtype-depleted DASs (Figure 5C and Data S1).

Predictive potential of B-ALL subtype-enriched DASs
We determined how well chromatin accessibility can predict B-ALL subtypes by constructing a stepwise principal compo- nent analysis-linear discriminant analysis (PCA-LDA) classifica- tion model using the 42,753 subtype-enriched DAS ATAC-seq read count matrix as initial input across ten B-ALL subtypes harboring known molecular drivers (outlined in Figure 6A). Notably, the constructed classification model was tested with leave-one-out cross-validation at an accuracy of 89%. The most common failure was incorrect classification of BCR::ABL1 and Ph-like subtypes (Figure 6B), as has been observed with other ALL classification algorithms.28 Taking this into account by grouping BCR::ABL1 and Ph-like subtype samples into a common class yielded a recalculated cross-validation accuracy
of 91%. Visualization of B-ALL subtype separations using select dimensions output by the LDA model demonstrates distinct groupings of related subtypes emphasizing classification-model performance (Figure 6C).
As a further validation of our classification model, we applied the classification algorithm to a separate ATAC-seq validation cohort comprising 24 B-ALL patient samples of known subtype covering ETV6::RUNX1, DUX4-rearranged and hyperdiploid subtypes from our previous work.29 The classification model was able to assign the correct subtype with 100% accuracy among the 24 B-ALL patient samples in the validation set. Clas- sification-model performance was visualized by projecting the validation cohort onto the original training model LDA dimen- sions, yielding a distinct clustering of training samples with vali- dation samples (Figure 6D). Collectively, these data support the utility of chromatin structure and subtype-enriched DASs in B-ALL subtype classification.

Mapping inherited DNA-sequence variants that impact chromatin accessibility
To determine how germline variation impacts chromatin acces- sibility, we identified chromatin-accessibility ATAC-QTLs in a subset of 69 patient samples with available SNP genotyping in- formation and allele-specific ATAC-seq read counting using RASQUAL.30 In total, 9,080 ATAC-QTLs were identified repre- senting both directionalities, with reference or alternative alleles increasing chromatin accessibility (FDR < 0.1; Figure 7A; Table S8). Manual quantification and scaling of allele-specific read counts for select ATAC-QTLs identified with RASQUAL demon- strated a clear concordance and directionality among individual patient samples classified into genotype groups (Figure 7B). Vi- sual inspection of merged read counts from patient samples grouped into reference allele homozygote, heterozygote, or alternative allele homozygote for select ATAC-QTLs further sup- ports the high-quality nature of identified ATAC-QTLs (Figure 7C). We further determined that 218 ATAC-QTLs were also lead expression QTL (eQTL) SNPs when compared to gene-tissue expression (GTEx) eQTLs31 from relevant tissues (blood and lymphoblastoid cells), with 85% also concordant for allele over-representation directionality (Figure 7D; Table S9). ATAC- QTLs were also compared with inherited genome-wide asso- ciation study variants for ALL disease susceptibility, which identified rs3824662 (GATA3)32 and rs17481869 (2p22.3)33 as ATAC-QTLs that were associated with the risk of developing B-ALL. Further supporting the validity of our methodology, rs3824662 was also identified as an ATAC-QTL in ALL PDX sam- ples,34 and we functionally validated differential allele-specific activity for rs17481869 in multiple B-ALL cell lines (Figure S11). To infer the impact of TF binding in control of chromatin acces- sibility at ATAC-QTLs, we overlapped ATAC-QTL loci with TF motifs determined as TF-bound by footprint profiling.12 Nearly one-third (28.8%; 2,615/9,080 ATAC-QTLs) of these ATAC- QTLs overlapped a TF-bound motif footprint across multiple B-ALL subtypes, suggesting that most ATAC-QTLs do not have a clear TF-binding mechanism regarding how they impact chromatin accessibility. Analysis of bound TF motif footprint prevalence at ATAC-QTLs identified several ETS family TFs (EHF, ELF3, SPI1/PU.1, and SPIB), zinc-finger TFs (ZNF263,

ZNF460, ZNF740, and ZNF148), and CTCF as the most altered motifs leading to differences in chromatin accessibility between alleles (Figure 7E). Notably, we also identified PAX5 and IKZF1, which have known roles in B cell development and leuke- mogenesis.35–38 Collectively, these data identify inherited DNA- sequence variants contributing to chromatin heterogeneity among B-ALL subtypes and indicate specific TFs of interest for further exploration of ATAC-QTLs.

DISCUSSION

Our study provides a large-scale examination of chromatin accessibility in the B-ALL genome across an expansive set of B-ALL subtypes. We further integrated these data with ChIP- seq histone modification enrichment in primary B-ALL cells and three-dimensional chromatin looping data using promoter capture Hi-C in multiple patient samples and B-ALL cell lines. Our data demonstrate that most regions of chromatin accessi- bility harbor activating chromatin marks consistent with cis-reg- ulatory elements involved in gene regulation, and we further confirmed direct looping to gene promoters for approximately 50% of accessible chromatin sites. However, this does not rule out more transient chromatin looping interactions difficult to detect by current chromatin conformation capture genomic techniques.
Extensive epigenomic reprogramming was uncovered be- tween B cell progenitors and B-ALL, and cell-of-origin analyses identified Pro-B cells as the most common cell of origin. Our comparison of B-ALL and Pro-B cell chromatin accessibility sug- gests epigenomic reprogramming that is, in part, associated with AP-1 TF occupancy. We further identify disruptions to normal B cell function through the activation of Toll-like receptor signaling and interleukin production. Acetyl-CoA synthesis was also iden- tified as an enriched gene ontology term when comparing B-ALL and Pro-B cells. Metabolic alterations in cancer are well known, particularly acetyl-CoA synthesis alterations, which have been previously reported in cancer.39
We further examined accessible chromatin landscapes among diverse molecular subtypes of B-ALL. Collectively, we identified 42,753 subtype-enriched DASs, which strikingly repre- sent 20% of analyzed accessible chromatin sites across a pan- subtype B-ALL genome. Subtype-enriched DASs were enriched near upregulated DEGs in the corresponding subtype, support- ing their role in gene activation. Moreover, comparisons between subtype-enriched DASs and chromatin-accessibility data from cell lines identified largely consistent patterns. We further identi- fied candidate TFs that exhibited strong subtype specificity through TF footprinting analyses and validated some of these findings using transcriptomic data from primary B-ALL cells. Collectively, these analyses highlighted a putative role for HOXA9 and MEIS1 in KMT2A-rearranged ALL, GATA3 in ZNF384-rearranged ALL, and RARA in PAX5-altered B-ALL.
We further confirmed the previously reported roles of DUX4 and ZNF384 in DUX4-rearranged and ZNF384-rearranged ALLs, respectively, and our more focused analysis of subtype- enriched DASs confirmed many of these TF hits. Concordant with our findings, previous studies have identified the co-upre- gulation of HOXA9 and MEIS1 in KMT2A-rearranged leukemias and further support that these TFs are key drivers of leukemo- genesis.40–42 Our identification of numerous HOX TFs with en- riched footprints in KMT2A-rearranged ALL is also consistent with observations of HOX gene dysregulation in this subtype.43 Further supporting our results, ZNF384 fusion proteins in ZNF384-rearranged ALL are known to upregulate GATA3 expression.44,45 Although a direct role for RARA in PAX5-altered B-ALL has not been established, previous work has identified PAX5 as a target gene of the PLZF-RARA fusion protein in acute promyelocytic leukemia.46 Moreover, both RARA and PAX5 genes can form fusions with PML in acute promyelocytic leuke- mia47 and ALL,48 respectively. While PAX5-altered ALL has not been well connected to RARA nuclear receptor signaling, there has been previous work treating IKZF1-mutated BCR-ABL1 ALL with RARA and RXR agonists that suppressed a self- renewal phenotype.49 Collectively, these data warrant further investigation of RARA and RXR signaling in PAX5-altered ALL.
In addition to key subtype-enriched TF footprints identified within accessible chromatin sites, we also assessed subtype- depleted DASs and identified numerous TFs that have been shown to act as repressors, such as ZNF135, ZNF263, ZEB1, and ZEB2. Intriguingly, several studies have supported a role for these repressors in cancers such as neuroblastoma and AML demonstrating enhanced tumorigenic phenotypes.50,51 Our observations support a more detailed examination of these repressive TFs in the occlusion of accessible chromatin sites in B-ALL.
Supporting the utility of chromatin accessibility in B-ALL clas- sification, subtype-enriched DASs predicted subtypes with 89% accuracy. As a comparison to chromatin accessibility, transcrip- tional profiling using ALLSorts correctly assigned B-ALL sub- types with 92% accuracy.28 However, this RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) dataset included over 1,223 transcriptomes from 18 subtypes, representing a considerably larger dataset for model development. We therefore suspect that additional chromatin- accessibility profiling across more B-ALL subtypes and incr- eased sample sizes will lead to even better subtype prediction that will rival transcriptomic profiling and, importantly, incorpo- rate intergenic heterogeneity that can elucidate cis-regulatory drivers of B-ALL leukemogenesis.
To identify the role of inherited DNA-sequence variation on the B-ALL chromatin landscape, we mapped over 9,000 ATAC- QTLs (FDR < 0.1). A large subset of ATAC-QTLs mapped to TF footprints and was concordant in allelic biases with GTEx lead eQTLs. We additionally identified several key TFs that appear to impact ATAC-QTL signal and chromatin accessibility,

including a subset known to impact B cell development and leukemogenesis, such as PAX5 and IKZF1.35–38 In addition, we identified ZNF263 as a top hit, which is consistent with our demonstration of enrichment for this transcriptional repressor at subtype-depleted DASs. Further validating our analysis, we functionally validated a variant (rs17481869; 2p22.3) associated with susceptibility to ALL.33 Collectively, this analysis suggests that chromatin accessibility is additionally modified by inherited DNA-sequence variation, thereby further contributing to increased chromatin heterogeneity in B-ALL.
Overall, our data support pronounced changes in chromatin accessibility between B-ALL and precursor B cells as well as among B-ALL subtypes. Our results further support the role of diverse TFs and inherited genetic variants in modulating and promoting differences in chromatin accessibility among B-ALL subtypes. Ultimately, these diverse chromatin architectures contribute to unique gene-regulatory networks and transcrip- tional programs. Our work therefore provides a valuable resource to the cancer genomics research community and can be further used to better understand biological as well as clinical differences among B-ALL subtypes.

Limitations of the study
Our study provides a valuable resource for the genomics and cancer research communities. Because this work represents a resource, a key limitation is the lack of mechanistic insights with extensive experimental validation. Indeed, many of our an- alyses, such as comparisons with B-ALL cell lines and B-ALL RNA-seq datasets, were performed to validate the accuracy and robustness of our ATAC-seq data. Our identification of Pro-B cells as the most common cell of origin was identified in mouse models,52 and a role for AP-1 TFs in B-ALL was also described in KMT2A-rearranged ALL.53 We also identified known B-ALL molecular drivers (e.g., DUX4 and ZNF384 in DUX4-rearranged and ZNF384-rearranged ALL, respectively) and previously documented gene-regulatory alterations in B-ALL (e.g., HOXA9 and MEIS1 activity in KMT2A-rearranged ALL). Collectively, these data support the validity of our ATAC- seq dataset. We further mapped key TF-target gene interactions that are enriched in B-ALL compared to progenitor B cells. Addi- tional work, including the generation of H3K27ac ChIP-seq and promoter capture Hi-C data in Pro-B cells and other B cell pro- genitors, is required to establish the extent of regulatory rewiring in B-ALL by these TFs. We also identified multiple additional TFs, including transcriptional repressors, in driving unique chromatin architectures among B-ALL subtypes. Additional experimenta- tion is likewise required to validate the roles for these TFs in maintaining or establishing chromatin architecture and in sub- type biology. Our classification model was able to predict molec- ular subtypes with high accuracy. We believe that additional ATAC-seq datasets, including data from rarer subtypes not inter- rogated in this study, will improve the accuracy of chromatin accessibility in discriminating B-ALL molecular subtypes. Further functional experimentation is also required to validate the effects of ATAC-QTLs on TF-binding events and neighboring gene expression and to determine whether these inherited ge- netic variants are associated with additional B-ALL cellular phe- notypes or even clinical phenotypes in patients.

Patient samples were obtained from: St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital (Memphis, Tennessee), ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group, The Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology, MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, Texas), Cook Children’s Medical Center (Fort Worth, Texas), Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital (Palo Alto, California), The University of Chicago (Chicago, Illinois), Novant Health Hemby Children’s Hospital (Charlotte, North Carolina) and Children’s Hospital of Michigan (Detroit, Michigan). A list of patient biospecimens is provided in Table S1. All patients or their legal guardians provided written informed consent. The use of these sam- ples was approved by the institutional review board at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. Sample size estimation was not per- formed prior to analyses. Patient samples were allocated to experimental groups (general B-ALL or B-ALL subtypes) based upon a combination of immunophenotype, cytogenetic and RNA transcript profiling. Detailed demographics of human patient samples were not available to incorporate into analyses. Differential chromatin accessibility loci localized to sex chromosomes should be utilized with caution.

METHOD DETAILS

ATAC-seq
ATAC-seq using the Fast-ATAC10 protocol was performed on 10,000 fresh primary ALL cells. Briefly, 10,000 cells were pelleted in a
1.5 mL Eppendorf low-bind sample tube (#022431021) and resuspended in 25 mL of transposase mix (25 mL TD buffer, 2.5 mL TDE1, 0.5 mL 1% digitonin, and 22 mL nuclease free water; see key resources table). Transposase reactions were incubated in 1.5mL Ep- pendorf low-bind sample tubes at 37◦C on a thermomixer set at 300 rpm. DNA was then purified using the MinElute PCR Purification Kit and eluted in 10 mL of elution buffer. Libraries were indexed and amplified using NEBNext 2x PCR master mix (New England Bio- labs, M0541L). Amplified DNA libraries were sequenced on a Nova-seq 6000 or NovaSeq X+ (Illumina) using 150bp paired-end sequencing. Adapter trimming was performed using TrimGalore (v0.6.6)63 with command options ‘‘–fastqc –paired’’. Read mapping was performed using Bowtie2 (v2.2.9)64 and hg19 genome index with custom command options ‘‘-X 2000 -S’’. Read quality filtering was performed with Samtools65 with the ‘‘view’’ command and options ‘‘-q 20 -b’’. Sorting was performed with Picard (v1.141)66 us- ing the ‘‘SortSam’’ command and options ‘‘SORT_ORDER = coordinate’’. Mitochondrial reads were removed using Samtools ‘‘view’’ command combined with command line filtering, ‘‘samtools view -h bam | awk ’{if($3 ! = "chrM"){print $0}}’ | samtools view -b
- > bam’’. Peak calling was performed with MACS267 (v2.1.1 using command and options ‘‘macs2 callpeak -t bam -f BAMPE -g hs –nomodel –extsize 200 –SPMR -B’’.

ChIP-seq
H3K27ac ChIP-seq was performed as previously described79 on 20 million fresh primary ALL cells. Briefly, cells were crosslinked using 1% formaldehyde (diluted from sigma F87750) at room temp for 10 min. Crosslinking was stopped with 2.5M glycine (final con- centration 0.125M). 5mg anti-H3K27Ac antibody (H3K27ac Rabbit pAb, Active Motif #39133) was bound to 200ul of protein G dyna- beads (Invitrogen 10003D) overnight in 0.5% BSA/PBS. 20M fixed cells were lysed in 1mL Farnham lysis buffer (5mM PIPES pH 8, 85mM KCl, 0.5% NP40, 1x protease inhibitors (Roche 11836170001)) and passed through an 18G needle 10x. Nuclei were resus- pended in 275ul of RIPA buffer (1x PBS, 1% NP40, 0.5% Sodium Deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1x protease inhibitors) and sonicated using a Diagenode Bioruptor Plus on high power in 1.5mL tubes for 25 cycles (30s on/30s off). 5% input samples were taken, and the remaining sonicated chromatin was rotated with the antibody/protein G beads overnight at 4C. The next morning the beads were washed 5x with ice-cold LiCl buffer (100mM Tris pH 7.5, 500mM LiCL, 1% NP40, 1% sodium deoxycholate) and 1x with ice-cold TE buffer (10mM Tris pH 7.5, 1mM EDTA). DNA was then eluted from the beads using elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 M NaHCO3) at 65◦C, vortexing 4x over 1 h. The eluted DNA and input DNA samples were then incubated at 65◦C overnight to reverse crosslinks. DNA was purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen 28104). DNA quantification was performed using the PicoGreen assay (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, P-7581). Sequencing libraries were generated from ChIP and input DNA by using the KAPA Hyper Prep kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland, # 7962363001) according to the included manufacturer’s specifications, and quality was determined by using the Agilent TapeStation with D1000 screentape.
Amplified DNA libraries were sequenced on a Nova-seq 6000 or NovaSeq X+ (Illumina) using 150bp single-end sequencing. Adapter trimming was performed using TrimGalore (v0.6.6) with command options ‘‘–fastqc’’. Read mapping was performed using Bowtie2 (v2.2.9)64 and hg19 genome index with custom command options ‘‘-X 2000 -S’’. Read quality filtering was performed with Samtools with the ‘‘view’’ command and options ‘‘-q 20 -b’’. Sorting was performed with Picard (v1.141) using the ‘‘SortSam’’ com- mand and options ‘‘SORT_ORDER = coordinate’’. Mitochondrial reads were removed using Samtools ‘‘view’’ command combined with command line filtering, ‘‘samtools view -h bam | awk ’{if($3 ! = "chrM"){print $0}}’ | samtools view -b - > bam’’. Peak calling was performed with MACS267 (v2.1.1) using command and options ‘‘macs2 callpeak -t bam -f BAM -g hs –nomodel –extsize 200 –SPMR -B’’.

CUT&RUN
CUT&RUN was performed using the Epicypher Cutana CUT&RUN kit v3.0 (14–1048) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 500k cells were bound to ConA beads at room temperature in wash buffer for 10 min. Bead-bound cells were suspended in antibody binding buffer containing 0.01% digitonin and incubated overnight at 4◦C on Nutator (Fisher Scientific S06622) 0.5 mg of each respective antibody (See key resources table). The next morning bead bound cells were washed twice with cell permeabilization buffer containing 0.01% digitonin to remove excess/unbound antibody. pAG-MNase was then added and allowed to bind the primary antibody for 10 min at room temperature. Immediately after binding, bead bound cells were washed twice with cell permeabilization buffer to remove excess/unbound pAG-MNase. Targeted chromatin digestion was started with the addition of 1 mL 100 mM calcium chloride and incubated for 2 h at 4◦C. The digestion was stopped with the addition of stop buffer containing 0.5 ng per sample of E. Coli spike-in. Fragments were then released for 10 min at 37◦C. The supernatant was then removed and subjected to DNA purification using the columns and buffers included in the kit. CUT&RUN DNA was quantified using the Quant-iT PicoGreen ds DNA assay (ThermoFisher). Libraries were prepared with HyperPrep Library Preparation Kit (Roche PN 07962363001) with modified PCR conditions:
Step 1 98C for 45s. Step 2 98C for 15s. Step 3 60C for 10s.

Repeat steps 2–4. 13 cycles for input >5 ng, 15 cycles for input <5 ng) Step 4 72C for 1min.
Libraries were analyzed for insert size distribution using the 2100 BioAnalyzer High Sensitivity kit (Agilent), 4200 TapeStation D1000 ScreenTape assay (Agilent), or 5300 Fragment Analyzer NGS fragment kit (Agilent). Libraries were quantified using the Quant-iT PicoGreen ds DNA assay (ThermoFisher) or by low pass sequencing with a MiSeq nano kit (Illumina). Paired-end sequencing was performed on a NovaSeq 6000 or NovaSeq X+ (Illumina). Data analysis of CUT&RUN samples was performed using Nextflow (2.10.6) and nextflow-core cutandrun pipeline (2.0.0) 74.

Promoter capture Hi-C
Arima promoter capture Hi-C (Arima product #s: A510008, A303010, A302010) was performed on B-ALL cell lines (697, Nalm6, RS411, REH, SUPB15, BALL1, SEM) or B-ALL patient samples (n = 10; BCR-ABL1, ETV6-RUNX1, KMT2A-rearranged, Ph-like, TCF3-PBX1 and B-other subytpes) according to the manufacturers provided instructions using unspecified proprietary buffers, so- lutions, enzymes, and reagents. Briefly, 10 million ALL cells were harvested, suspended in 5mL RT PBS which was brought to 2% formaldehyde by adding 37% methanol-stabilized paraformaldehyde for a 10-min fixation. For patient samples 1.5 to 5 million cells were fixed in 1% formaldehyde for 10 min. The amount of fixed cell suspension equal to 5mg of cell DNA was used for HiC. Cells were lysed with Lysis Buffer and conditioned with Conditioning Solution before their DNA was digested in a cocktail consisting of Buffer A, Enzyme 1, and Enzyme 2. The digested, fixed chromatin was biotinylated using Buffer B and Enzyme B before being ligated using Buffer C and Enzyme C. The fixed, biotinylated, ligated DNA was then subjected to reversal of crosslinking and digestion of proteins before being purified. 100ul containing 1500ug of purified large proximally ligated DNA was fragmented for 24 cycles (30s on/30s off) using a Diagenode Bioruptor Plus bath sonicator. The fragmented DNA was then subjected to two-sided size selection targeting frag- ments between 200 and 600bp using AMPure XP DNA purification beads. Size selected DNA was then subjected to biotin enrichment using T1 streptavidin beads. Bead bound, enriched HiC DNA was then subjected to Arima library prep. Briefly, the sample underwent end repair followed by adapter ligation, at which point the sample was then subjected to 10 cycles of PCR amplification. The library DNA was then purified using AMPure XP DNA purification beads. The HiC library was then subjected to Arima promoter capture enrichment. The library was precleared of biotinylated DNA using T1 streptavidin beads before being subjected to promoter enrich- ment with biotinylated RNA probes. After washing, the captured fragments were then amplified an additional 13 PCR cycles.
Amplified DNA libraries were sequenced on a Nova-seq 6000 or NovaSeq X+ (Illumina) using 150bp paired-end sequencing. Anal- ysis of promoter capture HiC data was performed using the Arima CHiC pipeline (v1.4, https://github.com/ArimaGenomics/CHiC). Briefly, this pipeline uses HiCUP v0.8.072 for mapping and quality assessment of promoter capture HiC data and CHiCAGO80 to iden- tify significant looping interactions in the promoter capture HiC data using 3kb resolution and adjusted p value <0.05. Files were pro- cessed at 3kb resolution with command ‘‘bash Arima-CHiC-v1.4.sh’’ with key custom options including: ‘‘-W 1 -Y 1 -Z 1 -P 1 -day Digest_hg19_Arima.txt -b human_GW_PC_S3207364_S3207414_hg19.uniq.bed -R hg19_chicago_input_3kb.rmap -B hg19_chica- go_input_3kb.baitmap -O hg19’’. The following input files: hiccup genome digest (Digest_hg19_Arima.txt), probe design file (hu- man_GW_PC_S3207364_S3207414_hg19.uniq.bed), rmap file (hg19_chicago_input_3kb.rmap), baitmap file (hg19_chicago_in- put_3kb.baitmap) and corresponding hg19 3kb resolution CHiCAGO design files (*.npb, *.poe, *.nbpb) were sourced from Arima FTP server (ftp://ftp-arimagenomics.sdsc.edu/pub/ARIMA_Capture_HiC_Settings/). All significant intrachromosomal chromatin in- teractions spanning less than 2Mb were concatenated from all B-ALL cell lines to create a comprehensive library of pan-B-ALL cell line promoter capture chromatin loops. Genomic regions representing separate loop ends were compiled to facilitate overlap determinations with B-ALL patient chromatin accessible regions of interest using ‘‘bedtools intersect’’.

Functional genomic data
Transcriptomic and SNP genotyping data from B-ALL patient samples were obtained from St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. Normal B cell ATAC-seq10,25 were downloaded from NCBI (GSE122989 and GSE74912). B-ALL cell line ATAC-seq and H3K27ac tracks associated with dCas9-KRAB repressor targeting or CRISPR/Cas9 deletions and investigation were downloaded from GEO under accession numbers GSE186942 27 and GSE129066.29 B-ALL cell histone modification ChIP-seq datasets (H3K27ac, H3K4me1 and H3K27me3) were downloaded from the Blueprint Epigenome Consortium (https://www.blueprint-epigenome.eu/). B-ALL ATAC-seq data in 24 patient samples used for validation of our classification model were downloaded from GEO under the accession number GSE161501.29 Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data was obtained from previous studies.29

ATAC-seq regions of interest selection
Accessible chromatin sites analyzed throughout this work were selected using a reproducible ATAC-seq peak summit approach as follows. Peak summits were generated for each subtype on a subtype-merged basis and narrowPeak regions for each individual pa- tient sample. Any subtype-merged peak summit not reproducible among multiple individual patient sample narrowPeaks was excluded for analysis. All reproducible, subtype-merged summits were then extended upstream and downstream to an interval size of 301bp and merged if overlapping. Finally, any interval overlapping hg19 blacklist regions were eliminated yielding the final set of ATAC-seq regions of interest used in further analysis. The ChIPseeker56 R-package was used for genomic annotation of all

genomic intervals throughout this work. Three B-ALL subtype patient samples (IKZF1 N159Y, iAMP21 and ETV6::RUNX1-Like) were included in B-ALL versus Pro-B cell analyses but were excluded from additional studies due to limited sample size.

B cell progenitor versus B-ALL cell comparisons
All samples were required to pass an ATAC-seq quality score cutoff to be included in analysis. ATAC-seq quality scores were deter- mined by calculating ATAC-seq read enrichment around transcription start sites. Normal progenitor cells were sourced from NCBI GEO (GSE122989 and GSE74912). In total, 185,135 merged peak intervals from progenitors were used as starting input across the differentiating cell types. These merged peaks were subsequently windowed into 250bp intervals (520,095) to better detect subtle differences between progenitors. DESeq257 using the Wald statistical test across these 520,095 250bp regions was utilized to calcu- late differential chromatin accessibility between B cell progenitors cells comparing a single progenitor to all other progenitors as a collective group. 42,344 out of 520,095 genomic intervals were identified (p-adjusted filter of <0.005 and an absolute value log2(fold change) R 1) as distinctive for B cell progenitors, approximately 8% of the total.57 Heatmap of hierarchical clustering between B cell progenitor cells and B-ALL samples were generated using the pheatmap R-package and variance stabilized ATAC-seq signal from DESeq2. DESeq257 using the Wald statistical test on the merged set of 217,240 B-ALL accessible chromatin sites was utilized to calculate differential chromatin accessibility between normal Pro-B cells and B-ALL patient samples. Differential chromatin acces- sibility between normal Pro-B cells and B-ALL patient samples was defined as chromatin regions passing a p-adjusted filter of <0.05 and an absolute value log2(fold change) R 1. A variance stabilized transform function within DESeq2 was applied to the ATAC-seq read counts matrix and Z score signal across all samples at Pro-B cell and B-ALL enriched DASs was used for hierarchical clustering using the pheatmap R-package.58 Code for heatmap generated between Pro-B and B-ALL cells used: pheatmap(ProB_vs_BALL_ results_vst_prog_ALL, color = plasma(11), cellwidth = 3, cellheight = NA, cluster_rows = T, cluster_cols = F, scale = "none", show_ rownames = FALSE, show_colnames = FALSE, annotation_col = prog_BALL_anno_df2, annotation_colors = ann_colors2, gaps_ col = c(3)). The Genomic Regions Enrichment of Annotations Tool (GREAT)78 was used to identify candidate target gene sets and ontologies associated with DASs. TOBIAS12 was used to identify TF footprints at accessible chromatin sites.

Subtype-enriched chromatin accessibility analysis
DESeq257 using the Wald statistical test was utilized to calculate differential chromatin accessibility among B-ALL subtypes. Cohorts representing a single subtype were compared to all other B-ALL patient samples not belonging to the single subtype as a collective group. This pairwise comparison was completed for all subtypes and samples with sufficient sample numbers (N > 1). Subtype-en- riched chromatin accessible regions were required to pass filters of p-adjusted <0.05 and an absolute value log2(fold change) R 1. Subtype-enriched regions were additionally required to be exclusively differential in a single subtype, regions appearing as differen- tial in multiple subtypes were excluded. A variance stabilized transform function within DESeq2 was applied to the ATAC-seq read counts matrix specific to subtype-enriched loci prior to visualization with the pheatmap R-package. TOBIAS12 was used to identify TF footprints at accessible chromatin sites. The Principal Component Analysis-Linear Discriminant Analysis (PCA-LDA) subtype classi- fication model was constructed stepwise by first PCA transformation of subtype-enriched ATAC-seq counts, then applying LDA on an optimized number of principal components.

Transcription factor-target gene network analysis
Enhancer and target gene prediction for network construction was analyzed with the ABC enhancer algorithm (https://github.com/ broadinstitute/ABC-Enhancer-Gene-Prediction) 26. In brief, inputs for the ABC enhancer algorithm included, B-ALL enriched DASs, merged B-ALL patient ATAC-seq, H3K27Ac ChIP-seq, Arima promoter capture Hi-C contact counts with ABC score threshold at 0.04.

ATAC-QTL identification
VCF (Variant Call Frequency) files were sourced from St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital genotyping. Variants in this dataset rep- resented a mixture of both directly genotyped and imputed variants. Imputation was performed via the Michigan imputation server (version 1.6.5) using minimac4 for imputation, eagle-2.4 for phasing and the TOPMed reference panel. The final variant list for analysis with RASQUAL30 was restricted to variants within B-ALL open chromatin regions yielding 914,406 variant SNPs in total. Allele specific ATAC-seq read counting for open chromatin region SNPs was performed with the RASQUAL supplied helper script which utilizes the GATK ASEReadCounter tool. All SNPs were required to have an imputation quality R2 of R 0.80 for final inclusion after running RASQUAL. Significant ATAC-QTLs for each region were identified with a genome-wide computed FDR of 10%.

CRISPR-Cas9 deletion of cis-regulatory elements
Targeted deletion pools were generated using CRISPR-Cas9 technology. Briefly, 500,000 parental cells from the corresponding cell line (Nalm6, 697 or SUPB15) were transiently transfected with two precomplexed ribonuclear protein (RNPs) consisting of 75 pmol of each chemically modified sgRNA (Synthego) and 60 pmol of 3X NLS SpCas9 protein (St. Jude Protein Production Core) via nucle- ofection (Lonza, 4D-Nucleofector X-unit) using solution P3 and program CV-104 for Nalm6, CA-137 for 697, CM-138 for SUPB15 cells in a small (20ml) cuvette according to the manufacturer’s recommended protocol (see Table S10). Three days post nucleofec- tion, cell pellets of approximately 10,000 cells were lysed and used to generate deletion specific amplicons that were run on a 1% agarose gel and sequenced via targeted next generation sequencing as previously described.81 Final pools were authenticated using

the PowerPlex Fusion System (Promega) performed at the Hartwell Center (St. Jude) and tested negative for mycoplasma by the MycoAlertPlus Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza). Editing construct sequences and relevant primers are listed in the table below. qPCR on cDNA from deleted and wild-type parental cells was performed using TaqMan probes for SLC2A9 (Hs01119178_m1, ThermoFisher), CDK14 (Hs00953416_m1, ThermoFisher) and SH3BP5L (Hs00944382_m1, ThermoFisher).
For gene expression measurements, parental (WT) and cis-regulatory element-deleted cells (Del) were cultured in RPMI 1640 me- dia (supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin, and 1% L-Glutamine). Cells were collected and lysed with RLT/BME mixture (1000 mL:10 mL) and processed for total RNA extraction (Qiagen #74104). cDNA synthesis was done using the High-Capacity RNA-to-cDNA kit (Applied Biosystems #4387406). TaqMan Fast Advanced Master Mix (Applied Biosystems #4444557) and TaqMan Gene Expression Assays probe (Thermo) were used to prepare RT-PCR reactions. Taqman probes used include: Hs00944382_m1 (SH3BP5L), Hs01119178_m1 (SLC2A9), Hs00953418_m1 (CDK14) and Hs00427620_m1 (TBP, endogenous control). The recom- mended Taqman Fast Advanced Master Mix PCR conditions were used to run the samples and the samples were run on a QuantStudio3 Real-Time PCR system.
For cell proliferation analyses, parental (WT) and cis-regulatory element-deleted cells (Del) were cultured in RPMI 1640 media (sup- plemented with 10% FBS, 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin, and 1% L-Glutamine) and plated on a 96 well plate using 0.2 3 10^5 cells per well (n = 3 per group). Cells proliferation was measured for up to 17 days by adding fresh media and expanding cells when confluence was reached. Absolute cell count was done by Trypan blue method using TC20 automated cell counter (Bio-Rad, #1450102) at different time points.

CRISPRi dCas9-KRAB enhancer targeting
Putative subtype-specific enhancer regions were selected based DESeq2 output parameters including: log2FoldChange >2, base- Mean >10, a lfcSE <20% of the log2FoldChange value, and autosomal chromosome location.
To design sgRNAs targeting enhancers, we used FlashFry55 to identify and score all candidate sgRNAs in a 2-kb window centered on ATAC-Seq peaks of interest. Candidates were kept that met the following scoring criteria: Doench2014OnTarget > 0.1, Hsu2013 > 50, JostCRISPRi_specificityscore > 0.1, dangerous_GC = = ‘‘NONE,’’ dangerous_polyT = = ‘‘NONE,’’ dangerous_in_ge- nome = = ‘‘IN_GENOME = 1’’, otCount <500. The final sgRNAs used for experiments were selected on the bases of shortest distance to ATAC and highest on-target score. Additional, previously described27 non-targeting (non-complementary to human genome) and non-coding (region of the human genome without regulatory relevance) sgRNA were selected as negative controls. 2 sgRNAs were selected for each putative enhancer (see Table S11). Complementary oligonucleotides encoding sgRNA sequences plus appropriate overhangs were synthesized (IDT), annealed, and cloned into BsmBI-digested sgOpti (Addgene #85681).
CRISPRi-ready SEM and Nalm6 cell populations with dox-inducible dCas9-KRAB and a GFP reporter (i.e., CiG) were generated as follows. Cells were transduced with lentivirus produced from TRE3-KRABdCas9-IRES-GFP and pLVX-EF1alpha-Tet3G vectors. Cells were serially sorted for GFP+ cells after doxycycline induction, for GFP-negative cells without doxycycline induction, and again for GFP+ cells after doxycycline induction.
For enhancer-targeting sgRNA experiments, SEM-CiG and NALM6-CiG cells were transduced with control and repeat enhancer- targeting sgRNA lentivirus by spinfection (see Table S11 for sgRNA sequences). Cells were treated 48 h after transduction with 1 mg/mL puromycin and 100 ng/mL doxycycline for an additional 72 h and were harvested (5 days after transduction) for RNA extrac- tion and RT-qPCR. RT-qPCR primers against target genes in proximity to proposed subtype-specific enhancers were designed by Primer-Blast70 with following settings modifications: GC clamp = 1, Exon Junction Span = ‘‘Primer must span an exon-exon junc- tion’’. Gene targets were selected by proximity to putative enhancers and evidence of promoter-enhancer linkage. For each sgRNA treatment, 2 biological replicates and 3 RT-qPCR technical replicates per biological replicates were generated. Undetermined (undetected) values for technical replicates were imputed utilizing the ‘qpcrImpute’ method from the R package ‘nondetects’.69 RT-qPCR data were analyzed by the delta-delta Ct (2–DDCt) method, averaging technical replicates. Biological replicate gene expression changes were pooled into negative control and enhancer knockdown groups (n = 2 sgRNAs x 2 biological replicates = 4) for determination of significance of gene knockdown by two-sample t test with unequal variance.

Luciferase reporter assays
A 301-bp fragment of DNA sequence centered on reference or the alternative alleles of rs17481869 (see Table S12) was cloned up- stream of the minimal promoter into the pGL4.23 vector (Promega, E841A). Ten million Nalm6, 697 or SUPB15 cell line were co-trans- fected with test DNA sequence-cloned pGL4.23 luciferase and renilla plasmid constructs using the Neon transfection system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MPK5000) with cell line optimized transfection parameters (Nalm6 = 1600V, 20ms, 1p; 697 = 1600V, 10ms, 3p; SUPB15 = 1450V, 20ms, 2p). After 24 h, firefly luciferase and renilla activity was measured on a BioTek Cytation1 plate reader (Agilent) using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, E1960). Luciferase activity was calculated as the ratio of firefly luciferase to Renilla luciferase activity.

QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

Initial chromatin accessibility intervals for individual cell line and patient samples before merging were filtered using the MACS2 nar- rowPeak file reported Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p value (q-value) requiring a q-value <0.05. Differential chromatin accessibility among B cell progenitor defining genomic loci was determined with DESeq2 using the Wald statistical test (covariates: none) requiring a Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p value < 0.005 and log2FoldChange R 1 or %1. Differential chromatin accessible regions were not required to be unique to a single progenitor comparison. Differential chromatin accessibility comparing B-ALL patient sam- ples with normal Pro-B samples was determined with DESeq2 using the Wald statistical test (covariates: none) requiring a Benjamini- Hochberg corrected p value < 0.05 and log2FoldChange R 1 or %1. Differential chromatin accessibility comparing singular B-ALL subtypes with all other B-ALL subtype samples was determined with DESeq2 using the Wald statistical test (covariates: TSS enrich- ment, hospital site of origin, and sequencing run) requiring a Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p value < 0.05 and log2FoldChange R 1 or %1. Regions demonstrating subtype enriched or depleted chromatin accessibility were required to be singularly unique to that subtype and not observed in any other subtype comparison. Patient samples representing ALL subtypes with only a single sample were excluded from subtype focused chromatin accessibility analyses. Additional details of quantification and statistical analyses can be found in methods details, figure legends and the github repository.
