Abstract
The k-tuple domination problem, for a fixed positive integer k, is to find in a given graph a minimum sized vertex subset such that every vertex in the graph is dominated by at least k vertices in this set. The k-tuple domination problem is NP-hard even for chordal graphs. For the class of circular-arc graphs, its complexity remains open for k ≥ 2. A 0, 1-matrix has the consecutive 0’s property (C0P) for columns if there is a permutation of its rows that places the 0’s consecutively in every column. Due to A. Tucker, graphs whose augmented adjacency matrix has the C0P for columns are circular-arc. In this work we provide efficient algorithms to solve the k-tuple domination problem on graphs G whose augmented adjacency matrices have the C0P for columns, for each 2 ≤ k ≤ |U| + 3, where U is the set of universal vertices of G.
Keywords: k-tuple dominating sets, stable sets, adjacency matrices, linear time


Preliminaries, definitions and notation
In this work we consider finite simple graphs G, where V (G) and E(G) denote its vertex and edge sets, respectively. Gj is a (vertex) induced subgraph of G and write Gj ⊆ G, if E(Gj) = {uv : uv ∈ E(G), {u, v} ⊆ V j}, for some V j ⊆ V (G). When necessary, we use G[V j] to denote Gj. Given S ⊆ V (G), the induced subgraph

G[V (G) \ S] is denoted by G− S. For simplicity, we write G − v instead of G − {v}, for v ∈ V (G).
The (closed) neighborhood of v ∈ V (G) is NG[v]= NG(v) ∪ {v}, where NG(v)= 
{u ∈ V (G): uv ∈ E(G)}. The minimum degree of G is denoted by δ(G) and is the minimum between the cardinalities of NG(v) for all v ∈ V (G).
A vertex v ∈ V (G) is universal if NG[v]= V (G).
A clique in G is a subset of pairwise adjacent vertices in G.
A stable set in G is a subset of mutually non-adjacent vertices in G and the cardinality of a stable set of maximum cardinality in G is denoted by α(G) and called the independence (or stability) number of G.
A graph G is circular-arc if it has an intersection model consisting of arcs on a circle, that is, if there is a one-to-one correspondence between the vertices of G and a family of arcs on a circle such that two distinct vertices are adjacent in G when the corresponding arcs intersect. Figure 1 shows a circular-arc model for the drawn graph G. A graph G is an interval graph if it has an intersection model consisting of intervals on the real line, that is, if there exists a family I of intervals on the real line and a one-to-one correspondence between the set of vertices of G and the intervals of I such that two vertices are adjacent in G when the corresponding intervals intersect. A proper interval graph is an interval graph that has a proper interval model, that is, an intersection model in which no interval contains another one. Circular-arc graphs constitute a superclass of proper interval graphs and they are of interest to workers in coding theory because of their relation to “circular” codes [14] and in testing for circular arrangements of genetic molecules [10].

The square matrix whose entries are all 1’s is denoted by J and the identity matrix by I, both of appropriate sizes.
The square matrix M (G) associated with a graph G is defined with entry mij =1 if vertices vi and vj are adjacent, and mij = 0 otherwise, it is called the adjacency matrix of G. Note that M (G) is symmetric and has 0’s on the main diagonal. The augmented adjacency matrix or neighborhood matrix M∗(G) with entries m∗ is defined as M∗(G) := M (G)+ I, i.e. M (G) with 1’s added on the main diagonal (see Fig. 2 which corresponds to the graph G of Fig. 1).
A 0, 1-matrix has the consecutive 0’s property (C0P) for columns if there is a permutation of its rows that places the 0’s consecutively in every column. This property was presented by Tucker in [14]. Figure 1 shows an example of a graph G whose augmented adjacency matrix —shown in Fig. 2— has this property. Tucker proved that graphs whose augmented adjacency matrix has the C0P for columns are circular-arc [14].
Fulkerson and Gross [5] have described an efficient algorithm to test whether a 0, 1-matrix has the C0P for columns and to obtain a desired row permutation when one exists.
For a non-negative integer k, D ⊆ V (G) is a k-tuple dominating set of G if
|NG[v] ∩ D| ≥ k, for every v ∈ V (G). Notice that G has k-tuple dominating sets if

and only if k ≤ δ(G) + 1 and, if G has a k-tuple dominating set D, then |D| ≥ k. When k ≤ δ(G)+ 1, γ×k(G) denotes the cardinality of a k-tuple dominating set of G of minimum size and γ×k(G) = +∞, when k > δ(G)+ 1. γ×k(G) is called the k-tuple dominating number of G [8]. Observe that γ×1(G) = γ(G), the usual domination number. Besides, note that γ×0(G) = 0 for every graph G. When G is not connected, the k-tuple dominating number of G is defined as the sum of the k-tuple dominating numbers of its connected components. Thus in this work, G will always be connected and the number k will be less or equal δ(G)+ 1.
For a fixed positive integer k, the k-tuple domination problem is to find in a given graph G, a k-tuple dominating set of G of size γ×k(G).
For a graph G, a positive integer t and S ⊆ V (G) with t ≤ |S|, we say that S t-dominates G if S is a t-tuple dominating set of G.

Concerning computational complexity results, the decision problem (fixed k) associated with this concept is NP-complete even for chordal graphs [11]. Efficient algorithms for every k are known only for strongly chordal graphs [11] and for P4- tidy graphs [4]. It is natural and challenging then to try to find other graph classes where these problems are “tractable”.
For circular-arc graphs, efficient algorithms are already presented in [1] and [9] only for the problem corresponding to k = 1. Besides, among the known polynomial time solvable instances of the problem for the case k = 2, proper interval graphs constitute the maximal subclass of chordal graphs already studied [13]. Proper

interval graphs were characterized by Roberts [12] as those graphs whose augmented adjacency matrices have the consecutive 1’s property for columns (defined also by Tucker [14] in a similar way as the C0P for columns).
With a different approach, polynomial algorithms were recently provided for some variations of domination, say k-domination and total k-domination (for fixed k) for proper interval graphs [2].
The slight difference involved in k-domination, k-tuple domination and total k-domination problems makes them useful in various applications, for example in forming sets of representatives or in resource allocation in distributed computing systems. However, the problems are all known to be NP-hard and also hard to approximate [3].
In this work we study 2- and 3-tuple domination on the subclass of circular- arc graphs whose augmented adjacency matrices have the C0P for columns. Our results then allow to solve the k-tuple domination problem in this graph class for 2 ≤ k ≤ |U| + 3, where U is the set of universal vertices, if any, of the input graph. In Sections 2 and 3, we present some properties on k-tuple domination for graphs with universal vertices, for any positive integer k. The study of the problem for k = 2 and k = 3, the running time analysis of the algorithms and further study for the general case are developed in Section 4.

k-tuple dominating sets on graphs with universal ver- tices
From the definition, it is clear that γ×k(G) ≥ k for every graph G and positive integer k. Besides, for any S ⊆ V (G) it is remarkable that it |S|-dominates G if and only if each vertex of S is a universal vertex. Thus, we can state the following.
Lemma 2.1 Let G be a graph, U the set of its universal vertices and k a positive integer. Then γ×k(G)= k if and only if |U|≥ k.
Notice that, when u is a universal vertex of a graph G and D ⊂ V (G) k- dominates G with u ∈/ D, then by interchanging u with any other vertex of D, we obtain another k-tuple dominating set containing u. Formally,
Remark 2.2 If G is a graph and u any universal vertex of G, there exists a k-tuple dominating set D of G such that u ∈ D.
From the above remark, it is easy to prove the following relationship:
Lemma 2.3 Let G be a graph, u a universal vertex of G and k a positive integer. Then
γ×k(G)= γ×(k−1)(G − u)+ 1.
Proof. Let D be a k-tuple dominating set of G with |D| = γ×k(G).
If u ∈ D, then D−u is a (k − 1)-tuple dominating set of G−u, thus γ×(k−1)(G−

u) +1 ≤ |D| = γ×k(G).  If u ∈/
D, from Remark 2.2 we can build a k-tuple

dominating set Dj of G with |Dj| = γ×k(G) and u ∈ Dj and proceed as above with
Dj instead of D.
On the other side, let D be a minimum (k − 1)-tuple dominating set of G − u. It is clear that D ∪ {u} is a k-tuple dominating set of G since u is a universal vertex. Then γ×k(G) ≤ |D ∪ {u}| = |D| +1 = γ×(k—1)(G − u) + 1, and the proof is complete.	2
The above lemma can be generalized as follows:
Proposition 2.4 Let G be a graph, U the set of its universal vertices and k a positive integer with |U|≤ k − 1. Then
γ×k(G)= γ×(k—|U|)(G − U )+ |U| .
The following corollary is clear from Lemma 2.1 and Proposition 2.4.
Corollary 2.5 Let G be a graph and U the set of its universal vertices with U /= ∅. If γ×i(G − U ) can be found in polynomial time for i = 1, 2, 3, then γ×k(G) can be found in polynomial time for every k with 1 ≤ k ≤ |U| + 3.
C0P-graphs. General properties
Recall that a 0, 1-matrix has the C0P for columns if there is a permutation of its rows that places the 0’s consecutively in every column. We introduce the following definition:
Definition 3.1 A graph G whose augmented adjancency matrix, M∗(G), has the C0P for columns is called a C0P -graph.
Remark 3.2 If G is a C0P-graph then G − U is a C0P-graph, where U is the set of universal vertices of G.
Let G be a C0P-graph with its vertices indexed so that the 0’s occur consecu- tively in each column of M∗(G). Let C1 be the set of columns whose 0’s are below the main diagonal, C2 the set of columns whose 0’s are above the main diagonal, and C3 the set of columns without 0’s (see Fig. 3 for an example). Sets C1, C2 and C3 partition V (G), C3 corresponds to the set U of universal vertices of G and G[C1] and G[C2] are cliques in G (if a vertex vi ∈ C1 is not adjacent to a vertex vj, the corresponding 0 in column j and row i has to be above the diagonal since the 0 in column i, row j is below). We denote this partition by (C1, C2,U ), or simply (C1, C2) when U = ∅ and then |C1|≥ 2 and |C2|≥ 2. Also for simplicity, we denote G1 := G[C1] and G2 := G[C2].
From now on, G is a C0P-graph and (C1, C2,U ) (or (C1, C2) when U = ∅) is the above mentioned partition of V (G).
It is easy to prove the following upper bound on the size of a minimum k-tuple dominating set of a C0P-graph:

Lemma 3.3 Let G be a C0P-graph and k a positive integer. If |Ci|≥ k for i = 1, 2, then
γ×k(G) ≤ 2k.
Proof. Let Di ⊆ Ci with |Di| = k, for i = 1, 2 and consider the set D1 ∪ D2. Take v ∈ V (G). If v ∈ Ci, then Di ⊆ NG[v], thus |NG[v] ∩ (D1 ∪ D2)| ≥ |Di| = k, for i = 1, 2. If v ∈ U , clearly D1 ∪ D2 ⊆ NG[v]= V (G) and thus |NG[v] ∩ (D1 ∪ D2)| =
|D1 ∪ D2| = 2k ≥ k. Then D1 ∪ D2 is a k-tuple dominating set of G and the upper bound follows.	2
Proposition 2.4 allows us to restrict our study of C0P-graphs to those with partition (C1, C2) and C1 and C2 are non-empty sets. Under these assumptions and Lemmas 2.1 and 3.3, we have k +1 ≤ γ×k(G) ≤ 2k for any C0P-graph G.
Following the notation in [14], let us denote V (G) = {v1, v2, ··· , vn}, C1 =
{v1, v2, ··· , vr} and C2 = {vr+1, vr+2, ··· , vn} for a given C0P-graph G with par-
tition (C1, C2). Also let us denote by M∗	, the submatrix of M∗(G) with rows

indexed by Ci and columns by Cj. Notice that M∗
and M∗
2 2
are both equal

to a matrix J of appropriate size.

Construction of auxiliary interval graphs Hi
Let G be a C0P-graph and (C1, C2) the above mentioned partition of V (G).
We construct two interval graphs H1 and H2 as follows:
for each vertex vi ∈ C1, define an interval Ii from [r + 1, n]N such that, if the consecutive 0’s of column vi correspond to the vertices vp, ..., vp+s where p ≥ r +1 and p + s ≤ n, then Ii = [p, p + s]N;
for each vertex vi ∈ C2, define an interval Ii from [1, r]N such that, if the con- secutive 0’s of column vi correspond to the vertices vp, ..., vp+s with p ≥ 1 and p + s ≤ r, then Ii = [p, p + s]N.
We will consider that vi represents the interval Ii, for each i = 1, ..., n.
The two interval graphs H1 and H2 constructed as above have interval models
I1 = {I1, I2, ..., Ir} and I2 = {Ir+1, Ir+2, ..., In}, respectively. An example of the above construction is shown in Fig. 4:

Fig. 4. Graphs H1 and H2 related to graph G of Figure 1.
Remark 3.4 For a C0P-graph G with partition (C1, C2,U ) and U /= ∅, graphs H1
and H2 are defined as above from the subgraph G − U of G.
It is clear that given two intersecting intervals Ii and Ij of H1 for 1 ≤ i /= j ≤ r,
there exists q with r +1 ≤ q ≤ n such that m∗	∗ = 0. This means that
vqvi ∈/ E(G) and vqvj ∈/ E(G). In other words, given two non-intersecting intervals

Ii and Ij of H1 for 1 ≤ i /= j ≤ r, we have m∗
= 1 or m∗
= 1 for all q with

r +1 ≤ q ≤ n. Therefore in each row of M∗
2 1
there exists at least one 1 in the

columns corresponding to vertex vi or vj, and then vqvi ∈ E(G) or vqvj ∈ E(G) for
all q with r +1 ≤ q ≤ n.
In a similar way, the above argument clearly holds for the interval graph H2.


Stable sets of Hi and tuple-dominating sets of G
We will denote by αi, the independence number of the interval graphs Hi constructed as in the previous subsection, for i ∈ {1, 2}. Let us remark that the independence number of an interval graph can be found in linear time [6]. We first have:
Lemma 3.5 Let G be a C0P-graph with partition (C1, C2), S ⊆ Cj, and t be a positive integer such that S t-dominates Gi, for i /= j. Then |S|≥ t + 1.
Proof. Since U = ∅, it is clear that for each vertex v ∈ Ci, there is a non-adjacent vertex w ∈ Cj, for i /= j and i ∈ {1, 2}. The inequality easily follows.	2
Thus, it is straightforward that any subset S ⊆ Ci |S|-dominates Gi, for each i ∈ {1, 2} and at most (|S|− 1)-dominates the whole graph G. When considering stable sets of Hi, the following interesting fact will be the key of the results in the next section:
Proposition 3.6 Let G be a C0P-graph with partition (C1, C2) and S ⊆ Ci, for some i ∈ {1, 2}. Then S is a stable set of Hi if and only if S (|S|− 1)-dominates Gj, for i /= j.
Proof. S is an (|S|− 1)-tuple dominating set of Gj if and only if for every vertex
v ∈ Cj, |NG[v] ∩ S| ≥ |S|− 1. In other words, S is an (|S|− 1)-tuple dominating

set of Gj if and only if for each row of M∗
there exists at most one zero in the

columns corresponding to vertices in S. This is equivalent to say that the set of intervals {It}t:vt∈S are pairwise non-adjacent, i.e S is a stable set of Hi.	2

k-tuple domination on C0P-graphs
The relationship exhibited in the previous section between tuple dominating sets of a given C0P-graph and stable sets of the auxiliary interval graphs H1 and H2 defined from it allows us to state the following general result for k-tuple domination on C0P-graphs.
Theorem 4.1 Let G be a C0P-graph with partition (C1, C2), interval graphs Hi deﬁned as in the previous section, and αi be the independence number of Hi, for each i ∈ {1, 2}. Then
if αi = 1 and D is a k-tuple dominating set of G, then |D ∩ Cj| ≥ k with
1 ≤ i /= j ≤ 2;
if α1 + α2 =2 then γ×k(G)= 2k;
if α1 + α2 > k then γ×k(G)= k + 1;
if α1 + α2 = k and |Ci|≥ αi +1 for i ∈ {1, 2} then γ×k(G)= k + 2.
Proof.
W.l.o.g., assume i = 1. Then α1 = 1 implies that the vertices in H1 are pairwise adjacent. Hence, the corresponding intervals are pairwise overlapping. It is known that the interval model of an interval graph fulfills the Helly property (for the definition of this property, see for example [7]). It follows that there

is a point that is part of every interval. Hence, there is a row j in M∗
2 1
that

contains only 0’s and thus vertex vj ∈ C2 is non-adjacent to every vertex in
C1. This implies that |D ∩ C2|≥ k for each k-tuple dominating set D of G.
If α1 = α2 = 1, then the previous item implies that any k-tuple dominating set of G has at leat 2k vertices. Thus γ×k(G) ≥ 2k. The equality follows from Lemma 3.3.
Let S1 and S2 be stable sets of H1 and H2 respectively, with |S1 ∪ S2| = k + 1. From Proposition 3.6 Si |Si|-dominates Gi and also (|Si|− 1)-dominates Gj for each i, j ∈ {1, 2} and i /= j. Thus S1 ∪ S2 is a k-tuple dominating set of G and then γ×k(G) ≤ k + 1. Since γ×k(G) > k from Lemma 2.1, we conclude that γ×k(G)= k + 1.
Let S1 and S2 be maximum stable sets of H1 and H2 respectively. It is clear that S1 ∪S2 is a (α1+α2 −1)-dominating set of G, i.e a (k−1)-dominating set of
G. Take two vertices w1 ∈ C1 −S1 and w2 ∈ C2 −S2. The set S1 ∪S2 ∪{w1, w2} is a k-tuple dominating set of G with cardinality k+2, implying γ×k(G) ≤ k+2. Now, since γ×k(G) ≥ k +1 (U = ∅), it is enough to show that γ×k(G) /= k +1. Suppose D is a minimum k-tuple dominating set of G with |D| = k + 1 and denote D1 = D ∩ C1, D2 = D ∩ C2, d1 = |D1| and d2 = |D2|. W.l.o.g. we assume α1 < d1 and α2 ≥ d2. It follows that D1 is not a stable set of H1. Thus, by Proposition 3.6, D1 dominates at best d1 − 2 vertices in C2. Therefore, for each vertex v ∈ C2, it holds |N [v] ∩ D|≤ d1 − 2+ d2 = k − 1 contradicting the fact that D is a k-tuple dominating set of G.	2

The results up to now allow us to completely solve the problems for the cases
k = 2 and k = 3, as shown in the following two subsections.
2-tuple domination
Theorem 4.2 Let G be a C0P-graph with partition (C1, C2,U ), interval graphs Hi deﬁned as in the previous section, and αi the independence number of Hi for each i ∈ {1, 2}.
If |U| =1 then γ×2(G)= 3.
If |U|≥ 2 then γ×2(G)= 2.
If |U| =0 and α1 + α2 ≥ 3 then γ×2(G)= 3.
If |U| =0 and α1 = α2 =1 then γ×2(G)= 4.
Proof.
From Lemma 2.3 we have γ×k(G) = γ×k(G − U ) + 1. Since G − U is not a complete graph, Lemma 2.1 implies γ×1(G − U ) ≥ 2. The set {w1, w2} is a 2-tuple dominating set of G − U , where w1 ∈ C1 and w2 ∈ C2 are any two vertices. Thus γ×1(G − U )= 2.
Follows from Lemma 2.1.
Follows from Proposition 4.1 item iii.
Follows from Proposition 4.1 item iv., taking into account that |U| = 0 implies
|Ci|≥ 2 for each i ∈ {1, 2}.	2

3-tuple domination
Theorem 4.3 Let G be a C0P-graph with partition (C1, C2,U ), interval graphs Hi deﬁned as in the previous section, and αi the independence number of Hi for each i ∈ {1, 2}.
If |U| = 1, then γ×3(G)=4 if α1 + α2 ≥ 3, and γ×3(G)=5 if α1 + α2 = 2.
If |U| =2 then γ×3(G)= 4.
If |U|≥ 3 then γ×3(G)= 3.
If |U| =0 and α1 + α2 ≥ 4 then γ×3(G)= 4.
If |U| =0 and α1 = α2 =1 then γ×3(G)= 6.
If |U| =0 and α1 + α2 =3 then γ×3(G)= 5.
Proof. Similarly as in the previous theorem, the proof follows by applying accord- ingly Lemmas 2.1 and 2.3, Proposition 2.4, Theorem 4.1 and Theorem 4.2.	2
Corollary 4.4 The k-tuple domination problem can be solved efficiently on a C0P- graph G for each 2 ≤ k ≤ |U| + 3, where U is the set of universal vertices of G.
Proof. Given a C0P-graph G, follow the next scheme:

Construct the augmented adjacency matrix M∗(G).
Apply the O(n2)-time algorithm in [5] to permute accordingly rows and columns of M∗(G) to ensure the structure shown in Fig. 3, where n = |V (G)|.
Build the interval graphs H1 and H2 as explained in Section 3.1 and find the independence number of Hi for i = 1, 2. As already pointed out, this can be done in lineal time [6].
Apply Theorem 4.2 and Theorem 4.3.
Following Proposition 2.4 the proof is completed.	2
We conclude by applying the previous findings to the graph G of Figure 1.
Example 4.5 Recall graph G from Figure 1 and the auxiliary graphs H1 and H2 of Figure 4. The results exposed in this section can be applied appropriately in order to calculate the values of γ×i(G) for each i ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4}. Actually, since α1 = 2 and α2 = 1, we have:
γ×4(G)= γ×3(G − v7) + 1=5 + 1= 6, γ×3(G)= γ×2(G − v7) + 1=3 + 1= 4,

and
γ×2(G)= γ×1(G − v7) + 1=2 + 1=3 

γ×1(G)= 1.

Conclusions
In this work we solved efficiently the k-tuple domination problem on the subclass of circular-arc graphs given by C0P-graphs, for each 2 ≤ k ≤ |U| + 3, where U is the set of universal vertices of the input graph. Notice that, when the augmented adjacency matrix of the input graph is given in the form of Fig. 3, our algorithm runs in linear time. We think that —under a suitable implementation— the techniques used in this paper together with the more general result in Theorem 4.1 can be further developed to solve the problem for the remaining values of k, even for other subclasses or moreover, the whole class of circular-arc graphs where the problems remain unsolved.
