In this article, shifted Chebyshev wavelets method is merged with quasilinearization technique to tackle with the nonlinearity of physical problems. The accuracy of the pro- posed method is verified by the help of two nonlinear physical models, one MHD squeezing flow between two infinite plates and other JefferyeHamel flow that is obtained using proper similarity transforms. Numerical solution is also sought using RungeeKutta order 4 method. Results obtained for different iterations and different values of degree of poly- nomial are described in tables and graphs which verify the accuracy and stability of the proposed method.

Introduction

After the pioneering works of Stefan [1], squeezing flows have been of much interest to the researchers due to their many practical and industrial applications. Many mechanical equipment work under the principle of moving pistons where
two plates exhibit squeezing moment normal to their own surfaces. Electric motors, engines and hydraulic lifters also have this squeezing flow in some of their parts. Its biological applications are also of equal importance. Flow inside sy- ringes and nasogastric tube is also a kind of squeezing flows. One can find more than enough literature on these flows in

Refs. [2,3] and references therein. Electrically conducting flows are also very important as a slight change in magnetic field
r vV + (V$V)V = V$T — f ,	(2.2)

may cause to flow to disperse or often to go smoothly for some	vt	B
time. It was therefore essential to discuss the flow under the

influence of magnetic field to see how it affects the flow behavior. Refs. [4e6] studied the effects of magnetic field on squeezing flow for different geometries and pointed out some important aspects of these flows.
Flows through nonparallel walls gain importance in early 19th century after the pioneering works of Jeffery [7] and Hamel [8]. Since then, there are many studies available that discussed the different practical and industrial applications of these flows and reported that flow characteristics vary by changing the angle between two channels [9e11]. Flows through rivers and channels, different biological flows such as flow through arteries and veins are some practical applica- tions of these types of flows. Due to nonlinearity of the

Cauchy Stress tensor given by,
T = —rI + A1,
where A1 = (VV)+ (VV)T.
While fB is a source term arising due to applied magnetic
field, i.e., the so called magnetic or Lorentz force. This force is known to be a function of the imposed magnetic field B, the induced electric field E and the fluid velocity vector V, that is
f B = s(E + V*V)*B.
Detailed derivation of the considered model is discussed in
Ref. [23]. Using compatibility equation

Chebyshev wavelets to obtain solutions for linear and
nonlinear boundary value problems [19]. Iqbal et al. obtained solutions for fractional delay differential equations using Chebyshev wavelets [20]. Since the models for which we are approximating solutions are of nonlinear in nature, so for better results we are also using quasilinearization technique. The quasilinearization technique was first introduced by Bellman and Kalaba [21] as a generalization of the New- toneRaphson method [22] to tackle the single or systems of
nonlinear ordinary or partial differential equations.
The proposed method formed by merging Chebyshev wavelets method with quasilinearization technique is fully
with associated auxiliary conditions

z = 0, then w = 0, vu = 0.	(2.5b)

We can now define stream function as
J(r, z)= r2f (z).	(2.6)
Replacing value from Eq. (2.6) into Eq. (2.4) reduces Eq. (2.4)
into a nonlinear ordinary differential equation

compatible for solving such nonlinear physical models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first article on Chebyshev
wavelet methods in fluid mechanics. Two non-linear prob-

Mathematical formulation
Nonlinear differential equation in Eq. (2.7) along with bound-
ary conditions in Eq. (2.8) can be made dimensionless by using the following non-dimensional parameters

F(0)= 0, F'' (0)= 0, F(1)= 1, F'(1)= 0.
JefferyeHamel flows

For the flow of an incompressible viscous fluid due to either a source or a sink that is present at the intersection of two rigid, nonparallel plane walls; angle between walls is 2a as shown in Fig. A. Flow is assumed to be symmetric and purely radial. These assumptions mean that the velocity field is of the form
V = [ur, 0, 0], where mr is a function of both r and q.
From Eqs. (2.12) and (2.13) after eliminating pressure terms and using Eqs. (2.15) and (2.16), we get a nonlinear ordinary differential equation for normalized velocity profile F(x)
F''' (x) + 2aReF(x)F'(x) + 4a2F'(x) = 0.	(2.17)
Accordingly the boundary conditions (2.14) are
F(0)= 1, F'(0)= 0, F(1)= 0,	(2.18)
where Re is Reynolds number given by
Re = fmax = Umaxra   Divergent Channel :  a > 0, Umax > 0  ,

v	v	Convergent Channel :  a < 0, Umax < 0
(2.19)
Umax here is center line velocity.


Shifted Chebyshev wavelets

In the present work, we use the shifted Chebyshev poly- nomials on [a,b], so the shifted Chebyshev nodes are

x = b — a cos (2k + 1)p + a + b,  k = 0, 1, 2, …, M — 1,

where a and b are real numbers with a < b. The shifted Che- byshev polynomials Tm(x) of order m are defined on the in- terval [a,b] and are given by the following recurrence formulae,

Some conditions are furnished by the initial or boundary
conditions, while for remaining conditions we replace yK,M in our differential equation to recover the unknown coefficients cn,m.


Quasilinearization

The quasilinearization [25,26] approach is a generalized NewtoneRaphson technique for differential equations. The quasilinearization technique converges quadratically to the exact solution if there is convergence at all and it has mono- tone convergence.
Consider a nonlinear second order differential
y (x)= f (y(x), x)	(4.1)
with the boundary conditions
Convergence of quasilinearization technique

The convergence of quasilinearization technique is derived and discussed in Ref. [25] which shows that the convergence of quasilinearization technique is second order if there is convergence at all.

Convergence of Chebyshev wavelets method

The convergence of Chebyshev wavelets method is derived in Ref. [20] which shows that the series solution by Chebyshev wavelets method converges to y(x) for differential equation of any order.
