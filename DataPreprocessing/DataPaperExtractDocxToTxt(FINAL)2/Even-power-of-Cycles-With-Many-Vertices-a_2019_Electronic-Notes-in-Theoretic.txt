Abstract
A power of cycle graph Ck is the graph obtained from the chordless cycle Cn by adding an edge between any pair of vertices of distance at most k. Power of cycle graphs have been extensively studied in the literature, in particular with respect to coloring problems, and both vertex-coloring and edge-coloring problems have been solved in the class. The total-coloring problem, however, is still open for power of cycle graphs. A graph G is Type 1 if can be totally colored with Δ(G) + 1 colors and is Type 2 if can not be colored with
Δ(G) + 1 and can be colored with Δ(G) + 2, with Δ(G) representing the maximum degree of a vertex in G. Although recent works from Campos and de Mello [4] and from Almeida et al. [1] point partial results for specific values of n and k, the total-coloring problem is far from being solved in the class. One remarkable
conjecture from Campos and de Mello [4] states that Ck, with 2 ≤ k < [n/2♩, is Type 2, if and only if
n is odd and n < 3(k + 1). In particular, the conjecture would imply that, for each k ≥ 2, the number
of Type 2 graphs is finite and every power of cycle graph Ck with n ≥ 3(k + 1) would be Type 1. We address Campos and de Mello conjecture for power of cycle graphs and we prove a weaker version of the conjecture for even-power of cycle graphs: every Ck with even k ≥ 2 and n ≥ 4k2 + 2k is Type 1. Our
proof is actually stronger and shows that, for each even k < [n/2♩, the number of Type 2 power of cycle
graphs Ck is at most 2k2 − k. Our results, therefore, constitute a strong evidence in favor of Campos and de Mello conjecture for power of cycle graphs.
Keywords: Graph theory, graph algorithms, total coloring, power of cycle graphs.

Fig. 1. The state of the art of the two problems (TCC and total coloring) in the graphs Ck. The rows of the table represent the parameter k and the columns represent the parameter n as a function of k. The entry Δ + 1 represents graphs that are Type 1; Δ + 2 represents graphs that are Type 2; TCC represents that the TCC has been proved but the classification between Type 1 and Type 2 is unknown; C represents the graphs that are not Type 1 because of the Conformable condition. Label C was omitted in the entries that already have another label, but every entry with odd n and 2k +1 < n < 3(k + 1) is also a C entry;
and O represents the graphs where both problems are unknown. The row k = 2 is fully solved, due to [3]. The rows k = 3 and k = 4 are fully solved, due to [1]. The column 2k + 1 consists of complete graphs, since 2k + 1 is odd, the graphs are Type 1 [15]. The column 2k + 2 is fully solved, due to [15]. The TCC was proved for the columns 2k +3 to 2k + 5, due to [15]. The TCC was proved for even n, due to [4]. The TCC was proved for Ck, with n = r(2k + 1)+ k and r > 0, due to [3]. Note that this result also proves the TCC for some specific values of odd n. The graphs Ck, with n = r(2k + 1) and r > 0, are Type 1, due to [3].
Introduction
The Total Chromatic Number χT (G) is the least number of colors needed to color the vertices and edges of a graph G such that no incident or adjacent elements (ver- tices and edges) receive the same color. The well known Total Coloring Conjecture (TCC), which was proposed independently by Behzad [2] and Vizing [14], states that for every simple graph G, χT (G) ≤ Δ(G)+ 2, with Δ(G) being the maximum degree of a vertex in V (G). The TCC has been settled for restricted graph fami- lies, such as the complete r-partite graphs, split graphs, dually chordal graphs, and graphs with a high maximum degree. However, the TCC for general graphs is open for more than fifty years and remains open when restricted to chordal graphs and power of cycle graphs.
We call total coloring a function C : E(G) ∪ V (G) → [t], where [t]= {0,..., t}, and adjacent elements must receive distinct colors. A color of a vertex vi is denoted by C(vi), similarly a color of an edge vivj is denoted by C(vivj). It is easy to see that no graph can be totally colored with less than Δ(G) + 1 colors, which implies a lower bound for the total chromatic number χT (G) ≥ Δ(G)+ 1. If a graph G can be totally colored with Δ(G) + 1 colors it is called Type 1, if it can not be colored with Δ(G) + 1 colors but can be colored with Δ(G) + 2 colors it is called Type 2. Sa´nchez-Arroyo [12] proved that the total-coloring problem of determining the total chromatic number is NP-hard. It is important to note that there is no “implication relation” between the validity of the TCC in a class and the complexity of the total-coloring problem. For example, for bipartite graphs, the TCC is solved, but the total-coloring problem is NP-hard [12]. On the other hand, for graphs with bounded tree-width, the total-coloring problem is polynomial but the TCC is not yet settled [8].
There exists a strong parallel between edge coloring and total coloring. The cele- brated Vizing’s theorem implies the edge-coloring classification problem into Class 1 (edge-colorable graphs with Δ colors) and Class 2 (edge-colorable graphs with Δ+ 1 colors), while the TCC would imply the total-coloring classification of graphs into Type 1 and Type 2. Note that both edge-coloring and total-coloring problems are

NP-complete. In particular, the total-coloring problem was first proved to be NP- hard [12] by a reduction from edge coloring; this could suggest that total coloring would be a harder problem, nevertheless, we know classes where edge coloring is NP-hard but total-coloring is polynomial [9]. Since both edge-coloring and total- coloring are NP-complete problems, effort has been done in the sense of defining “easy” sufficient or necessary conditions for a graph to be Class 1 or Type 1, and we discuss two of such conditions next. The overfull condition for edge coloring states that the number of edges is greater than Δ [n/2♩ and is a sufficient condition for a graph to be Class 2 — for a graph to be Class 1 it is necessary to be non-overfull. For example, any regular graph with odd n is overfull and therefore Class 2. The basic classes of cycle and complete graphs are fully classified with respect to edge coloring by using the overfull condition. The conformable condition for total col- oring is a necessary condition for a graph to be Type 1, and requires the existence of a particular vertex coloring with Δ + 1 colors with the property that “many” color classes have the same parity as the order of the graph — where the number of such color classes is related to the difference between the maximum degree and the average degree. For regular graphs, when that difference is zero, the conformable condition requires that every color class has the same parity as the order of the graph [5].
A power of cycle graph, denoted by Ck, is a graph where V (Ck)  =
n	n
{v0, v1,..., vn−1}, where v0, v1,..., vn−1 is a spanning cycle, and E(Ck) = E1 ∪
··· ∪ Ek, where Ei = {vjv(j+i) | 0 ≤ j ≤ n − 1}. In this work, when we refer to a vertex vi ∈ V (Ck) we mean vi mod n. Power of cycle graphs are a well studied class of graphs with respect to several variations of coloring problems. The vertex-coloring problem can be solved in the class with a greedy algorithm [3] and the edge-coloring problem can be solved using the overfull condition [10].
By definition, the power of cycle graphs Ck generalize the cycle graphs Cn = C1
n	n
and the complete graphs Kn = Ck, with k ≥ [n/2♩. The basic class of complete
graphs is fully classified with respect to total coloring by using the conformable condition: the Type 1 complete graphs Kn are precisely the conformable ones, i.e., the graphs Kn with n mod 2 = 1. However, the conformable condition does not characterize the Type 1 cycle graphs, as there are conformable cycle graphs that are Type 2, for example, graph C7.
There are results towards the TCC and the total-coloring problem for power of cycle graphs Ck for specific values of n and k. Figure 1 summarizes these results, the first column n = 2k + 1 represents the Type 1 complete graphs since n is odd. If n is odd and 2k +1 < n < 3(k + 1), then Ck is not Type 1 [3]; If k = 2 and

n > 2k + 1, then Ck
is Type 2 if n = 7 and Type 1 otherwise [3]; if k = 3 and

n > 2k + 1, then Ck is Type 2 if n =9 or n = 11 and Type 1 otherwise; and if k =4 and n > 2k + 1, then Ck is Type 2 if n = 11 or n = 13 and Type 1 otherwise [1]. The last two results were presented at VI Latin American Workshop on Cliques in Graphs in 2014 and they are published in the conference book of abstracts (with no detailed proofs). If n is even and n > 2k +1 or n = r(2k + 1)+ k with integer r > 0, then the TCC for such Ck graphs was proved [4]; If n = r(2k +1) with integer

r > 0, then Ck is Type 1. This result is specially interesting because it is a corollary of the pullback algorithm by de Figueiredo, Meidanis, and de Mello [6] and of the Very Greedy Neighborhood Coloring (V GNC) algorithm by Golumbic [7].
Campos [3] showed that if a power of cycle graph Ck, with 2 < k < [n/2♩ and odd n, is conformable, then n ≥ 3(k + 1). In other words, for 2 < k < [n/2♩, if n is odd and n < 3(k + 1), then the Ck is not Type 1. Campos and de Mello [4] proposed a remarkable conjecture that those would be precisely the Type 2 power of cycle graphs for that range of k:
Conjecture 1.1 ([4]) Let G = Ck, with 2 ≤ k < [n/2♩. If k > n − 1 and n is
n	3
odd, then χT (G)=Δ + 2. Otherwise, χT (G)=Δ + 1.
We give a strong evidence for Conjecture 1.1: we prove that every even-power of cycle graph Ck, with n ≥ 4k2 +2k is Type 1. Moreover, we prove that, for each even k < [n/2♩, the number of Type 2 power of cycle graphs Ck is at most 2k2 − k, by showing a Type 1 total coloring for every other graph under the considered range. We also prove that for every fixed k ≥ 2, if n is bigger than a function f (k) we can
decompose a graph Ck into two graphs Ck  and Ck , with n = n1 + n2, giving a
n	n1	n2
decomposition-based polynomial-time algorithm that total-colors a power of cycle

k by total-coloring the graphs Ck
and Ck
and applying the same reasoning

recursively for Ck
and Ck
if n1 > f (k) or n2 > f (k).

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we define operations and op- erators that are used in Section 3 to present a threshold for a even-power of cycle graph to be Type 1. In Section 4 we present a framework to decompose a power of cycle graph into a set of smaller power of cycle graphs. In Section 5 we present our conclusions and possible further directions and applications of the developed tools.

Compatibility and bottom-up composition
In this section, we define two operations used as part of the process of construct a
Type 1 total coloring of a graph Ck, from two other Type 1 graphs Ck  and Ck ,

n
such that n1 + n2 = n.

A power of path graph, denoted by Pk, is a graph where V (Pk)  =
n	n
{v0, v1,..., vn—1}, where v0, v1,..., vn—1 is a spanning path, and E(Pk) = E1 ∪
···∪ Ek, where Ei = {vjv(j+i) | 0 ≤ j ≤ n − 1}. In power of path graphs vj+i is not a modular operation.
We aim to decompose a power of cycle graph Ck into two power of path graphs
k  and Pk , with n1 + n2 = n, and two sets of edges N—(wx)N +(wx—1) and
N—(wy)N +(wy—1), with wx, wy ∈ V (Ck), in such way that we can use a total

coloring of the graphs Ck
and Ck
to totally color Pk
and Pk , respectively, using

the colors of the edges of E(Ck ) \ E(Pk ) and E(Ck ) \ E(Pk ) to color the edges
n1	n1	n2	n2
of N—(wx)N +(wx—1) and N—(wy)N +(wy—1) to obtain a valid total color of Ck.
The operation of transfer total colorings is called pullback and it was defined by de Figueiredo, Meidanis, and de Mello [6]. The pullback from G to Gj is a function f : V (G) → V (Gj), such that: (i) f is a homomorphism, i.e., if pq ∈ E(G), then

dashed edges represent the sets N−(wx)N +(wx−1) and N−(wy)N +(wy−1). (b) The vertex vi represents
the first vertex of the graph P 3 , the same occurs with the vertex uj which is the first vertex of P 3. The

P 3 , but the sets can be seen in 2a.
f (p)f (q) ∈ E(Gj); (ii) f is injective when restricted to N (p), with N (p) representing the open neighborhood of p, for p ∈ V (G). The pullback is a powerful tool that allows us to transfer colorings from one graph to other.
We define more formally the operations and the operators of this procedure in Definitions 2.1 and 2.2.
Definition 2.1 We say that a k-power of path decomposition of a power of cycle
graph Ck is a decomposition into two power of path graphs Pk  and Pk , and two
n	n1	n2
sets of edges N—(wx)N +(wx—1) and N—(wy)N +(wy—1), with the distance between

wx, wy ∈ Ck
in the spanning cycle is greater than 2k. wx represents the vertex

vi ∈ Pk
which is the first vertex of the induced path of Pk
and wy represents

the vertex uj ∈ Pk which is the first vertex of the induced path of Pk . Note that
every power of cycle graph Ck with n ≥ 4k +2 has a k-power of path decomposition. Figure 2 illustrates a 3-power of path decomposition of C3 .
A semi-cut of vertices of a graph Ck, is a set of k consecutive vertices in V (G), considering the cyclic order. We denote two special semi-cuts of vertices: N—(wx)= 
{wq | x − k ≤ q < x} and N +(wx—1) = {vq | x ≤ q < x + k}. A semi-cut of
edges of a graph Ck is a set N—(wx)N +(wx—1) which represents the edges that
have one extreme in N—(wx) and the other extreme in N +(wx—1), more formally
N—(wx)N +(vx—1) = {vqvl | x − k < q ≤ x, x < l ≤ x + k e l − q ≤ k}. Figure 3
shows a graph C3 and the sets N—(v3), N +(v2), and N—(v3)N +(v2). Each set is
a shade highlighted in one table. The tables show total colorings, in such way that the color of an edge vivj is represented by the cell i, j of the matrix. The color of the vertex vi is represented by the cell i, i.

Definition 2.2 We say that two graphs Ck
and Ck
are Type 1-compatible if

each graph has a Type 1 total coloring C1 and C2 and pivot vertices vi and uj, respectively, such that the following holds: (a) N—(vi) is compatible with N +(uj—1), meaning C1(vi—r) /= C2(uj+s); (b) N +(vi—1) is compatible with N—(uj), meaning C1(vi+s) /= C2(uj—r), for every r ∈ {0,...,k − 1} and every s ∈ {1,...,k − r};

(c) N—(vi)N +(vi—1) is compatible with N—(uj)N +(uj—1), meaning C1(vi—rvi+s)= C2(uj—ruj+s), for every r ∈ {0,...,k − 1} and every s ∈ {1,..., k}. By definition, every Type 1 graph is Type 1-compatible with itself.
A threshold for power of cycle graphs to be Type 1
In this section, we prove the main results of this work. Theorem 3.1 shows an operation of composition between two graphs.

Theorem 3.1 If two graphs Ck
and Ck
are Type 1-compatible, then the graph

Ck, with n = n1 + n2, is Type 1-compatible with Ck  and Ck .
n	n1	n2

Proof. Since Ck
and Ck
are Type 1 - compatible, there are two Type 1 total

colorings C1 and C2 and vertices vi ∈ V (Ck ) and a vertex uj ∈ V (Ck ) that fulfill
n1	n2
the restrictions of the Definition 2.2.

The graph Pk
is formed from the graph Ck
by removing the edges of

N—(vi)N +(vi—1). And the graph Pk
the graph Ck
by removing the edges of

N—(uj)N +(uj—1).
Since the graph Ck has a k-power of path decomposition, we can use a pullback

of the total coloring of the graphs Ck
and Ck
to the power of path graphs Pk

and Pk . Then we only need to color the edges of the sets N—(wx)N +(wx—1) and N—(wy)N +(wy—1), but we can make the same pullback technique to the colors of N—(vi)N +(vi—1) and N—(uj)N +(uj—1).	2
In the next Theorem, we make a recoloring procedure from a famous latin square L to a valid total coloring represented by a matrix M , of order 2k + 2, in such way that this matrices represents Type 1-compatible total colorings of the graphs Ck

k
2k+2
, respectively. The procedure can be divided in three steps: First, from

the conformable condition, we know that we have to change the colors of some
vertices in such way that every color colors a even number of vertices. For this,

; the green cells represent the

cells of the set N−(v4)N +(v3); the light blue cells represent the set N−(v4); the dark blue cells represent

we have to swap some colors using the fact that the matrix M has cells that not

represent valid edges in the graph Ck
. The second step is the inclusion of the

new colors in M that represent the vertex and the edges that are in Ck
but not

k
2k+1
. The third step made is to make the two total coloring conformable with

other. Combining Theorem 3.2 with Theorem 3.1 we show that every power of cycle
graph Ck, with even k, is Type 1 except for 2k2 − k graphs.


Theorem 3.2 The graphs Ck
k
2k+2
, with even k, are Type 1-compatible.

Proof. The matrix M represents the total coloring of the graph Ck
. The order

of M is 2k + 2 and it has the same properties of the a latin square L, which is used to total coloring complete graphs [15]. The diagonal cells of M represent the colors of the vertices and the off-diagonal cells represent the colors of the edges. Set each cell L[i, j] = M [i, j] = (i + j) mod 2k + 1, with 0 ≤ i, j ≤ 2k. Figure 4a represents the matrix L and Figure 4c represents the matrix M . Note that the cells M [x, k +1+ x], with x ∈ {0,..., k} represent edges that do not exist in the graph

k
2k+2
because of the distance between the vertices, so these cells can be ignored in

our procedure.
Figure 4d has the vertices that start the following procedure highlighted and the cells that have colors swapped have the same shade in the figure. We make a recoloring procedure on the matrix M , this procedure can be made in three steps:
For s ∈ {1,..., k/2} we change the color of the cells M [k + s − r, k + s + r], to the color of the cells M [k + s−r − 1,k + s + r], with r ∈ {0,..., k/2}, note that the cells M [k + s − k/2+1 − 1,k + s + k/2 + 1] = M [k/2+ s, k/2+ s + k + 1]

represent the edges that do not exist in the graph Ck
, so this allows us to

stop the procedure with no conflict of colors in M .
For s = k/2 + 1 we change the color of the cells M [k + s − r, k + s + r], to the color of the cells M [k + s − r − 1,k + s + r], with r ∈ {0,..., k/2 − 1}. Note that the cell M [k + s − (k/2 − 1),k + k/2+1+ k/2 − 1] = M [k + 2, 2k] receive the original color of the cell M [k + 1, 2k]= k +1 = M [0,k + 1], which is a cell

that represents an edge that do not exists in Ck
. So we end this case with

no conflict of colors.
For the case where s ∈ {k/2+ 2,..., k} we change the color of the cells M [k +
s − r, k + s + r], to the color of the cells M [k + s − r − 1,k + s + r], with r ∈
{0,..., k/2 − 1}. Note that in this case we have to use module 2k + 1. The cell
M [k+s−(k/2−1)−1, k+s+(k/2−1)] = M [k/2+s, (k+k/2+s−1) mod 2k + 1]

represent the edges that do not exist in the graph Ck
, so this allows us to

stop the procedure with no conflict of colors in M .
To color the row 2k+1 of M we use the following procedure: M [k+i+1, 2k+1] = L[i, k + 1], representing the colors of the edges which do not exist in the graph, and M [i, 2k + 1] = L[i, k], representing the colors that were changed by procedure of recoloring, with i ∈ {0,...,k − 1}. And the cell M [2k + 1, 2k + 1] = 2k, the only color possible for the new vertex. This step is illustrated in Figure 4e.

To show that the matrix M is a valid total coloring for a graph Ck
we have

to show that:
The diagonal cells represents a proper vertex coloring: Since we use as base the colors of L, in which all the diagonal cells are distinct, we only change the colors of the cells M [k + i + 1,k + i + 1] to the color L[k + i, k + i + 1] = (2k + 2i + 1) mod 2k +1 = 2i, with i ∈ {0,...,k − 1} and add the color 2k to the cell M [2k + 1, 2k + 1]. As the color 2i is used as a diagonal color in the cell M [i][i] and in the cell M [k + i + 1][k + i + 1], this can be used as a proper

vertex coloring of the graph Ck
, since the only repetition of colors happen

in vertices which have distance k + 1, therefore do not adjacent.
Every row and column of M , excluding the cells which represents an edge that

do not exists in Ck
, is a permutation of 2k + 1 elements: Since we use

L as base and by construction of the recoloring procedure we only stop the recoloring when the conflict was in one of the cells that represent the edges
that do not exist in the graph Ck	, then M is a valid total coloring of Ck	.
Now, we have to swap the colors of all the cells which have colors M [i, i] to the color M [i, i + 1], with i ∈ {0,..., k/2 − 2} and k > 2. Note that this swap do not change any property of the M .

Now M and L represents the Type 1 total colorings of Ck
k
2k+1
, respec-

tively, in such way that the first vertex in the spanning cycle is represented by the
first row (or column) in the respectively matrix, the second vertex is represented by the second row in the matrix and so on.

To show that Ck
k
2k+1
are compatible, we have to fulfill the conditions

of the Definition 2.2. So lets call Ck	of Ck  and Ck	of Ck , the vertex vi ∈ Ck ,
2k+2	n1	2k+1	n2	n1

which i = k − 1 and uj ∈ Ck
with j = k − 1.

To prove (a) of the Definition 2.2: Note that N—(vi—1) have the vertices vp, with p ∈ {0,...,k − 1}, and C1(vp)= 2p. Now note that N +(uj—1) have the vertices uq, with q ∈ {k,..., 2k−1}, and C2(uq)= 2(q−k), if q > k and if q = k, C2(uq)= 2k, so the distance between the vertex which have the same color is k + 1, clearly N—(vi—1) and N +(vj—1) are compatible.
To prove (b) of the Definition 2.2: Note that N +(vi—1) have the vertices vp, with p ∈ {k, ..., 2k − 1}, and C2(vp)= 2(p − k), if p > k and if p = k, C1(vp)= 2k. Note that N—(uj—1) have the vertices uq, with q ∈ {0,...,k − 1}, and C1(uq)= 2p + 1, if q ≤ k/2 − 1 and C1(uq)= 2q, otherwise.
To prove (c) of the Definition 2.2: Since we use the same latin square L to generate the total colorings and the only part of the recoloring procedure that change the color of a cell which represent an edge in N—(vi)N +(vi—1) is the Item
(i) and we make the changes in L to change the exactly the colors that are affected by (i), the sets N—(vi)N +(vi—1) is compatible with N—(uj)N +(uj—1). Figure 4b show the matrix M representing a valid total coloring that is compatible with the coloring represented by the latin square L.	2
Lemma 3.3 is used in the Theorem 3.4 to prove our main result.
Lemma 3.3 If z ≥ a2 − a, ∃x, y ≥ 0, such that z = xa + y(a + 1).
Proof. The prove is made by induction in z. If z = a2 − a, then z = xa + 0(a + 1), with x = a − 1. Supose that for any z1 > a2 − a, z1 = x1a + y1(a + 1). For z2 = z1 + 1: if x1 > 0, than z2 = (x1 − 1)a + (y1 + 1)(a + 1). If x1 = 0, then: z1 = 0a + y1(a + 1) and as z1 > a2 − a, y1 ≥ a − 1. So we can write z1 = (a + 1)(a − 1) + (y1 − (a − 1))(a + 1) = a2 − 1+ (y1 − (a − 1))(a + 1) and then
z2 = x2a + y2(a + 1), with x2 = a and y2 = y1 − (a − 1).	2
Note that the threshold given in the Lemma 3.3 is tight, as this is a classic linear diophantine equation, is known that if z = a2 − a − 1, then z = xa + y(a + 1) has no valid integer solutions.
Theorem 3.4 Every graph Ck with even k ≥ 2 and n ≥ 4k2 + 2k is Type 1.
Proof. Following Lemma 3.3, n = x(2k + 1)+ y(2k + 2), then we only need to
compose x times the graph Ck	and y times Ck	.	2
Proposition 3.5 For a ﬁxed even k, with 2k +1 ≤ n ≤ 4k2 + 2k, 2k2 − k graphs
Ck are Type 1.
Proof. The proof can be made by induction in s, which denote the number of
graphs that will compose the target graph. For s = 2: We have the graphs Ck	,

given 3 < s < 2k: We have the graphs Ck

that 2k − s graphs were not totally colored. And for any Ck, with n ≥ 4k2 + 2k all
the graphs are Type 1.
Note that for each 2 ≤ s ≤ 2k, only 2k − s graphs were not totally colored, so only 2k2 − k graphs were not colored.	2
The next result shows that for small values of odd k the technique presented in Theorem 3.2 is valid. Thus, the results presented in Theorem 3.4 hold for these graphs.

and k = 7.
Top-down decomposition
In this section, we give a framework to decompose any power of cycle graph with many vertices into two power of cycle graphs with a limited number of the vertices. This result shows that we only need to consider a finite number of power of cycle graphs for a given fixed k.
Let Ck[N [v]] be the graph induced in G = Ck by the closed neighborhood of a
n	n
vertex v ∈ V (G) and let f (k) be the number of distinct total colorings of Ck[N [v]].
Theorem 4.1 shows that every power of cycle with large order — in the sense that
n > f (k) — can be decomposed into smaller compatible graphs.

Theorem 4.1 If n > f (k), then Ck
can be decomposed into two power of cycle

graphs Ck  and Ck , such that n = n1 + n2 and Ck , Ck
are compatible.

n1	n2	n1	n2
Proof. Suppose that G is t-total colorable and n > f (k).
Since n > f (k) then, by pigeonhole principle, there are at least one pair of vertices wx, wy ∈ V (Ck) such that Ck[N [wx]] and Ck[N [wy]] have the same total
n	n	n
coloring (preserving the cyclic order of the elements). Thus, we can decompose
k into two power of cycle graphs Ck  and Ck , with n1 + n2 = n, using the
reverse operation applied in Theorem 3.1, with wx representing the vertex vj and
wy representing the vertex uj.	2

N. Trotignon and K. Vuˇskovi´c [13] defined that a decomposition is said to be extremal if at least one of the blocks is simple, i.e., it can not be decomposed into smaller blocks. If we apply same reasoning of Theorem 4.1 recursively, we can generate an extremal total coloring tree decomposition, such that: the root of the tree is the original power of cycle graph Ck, two sibling nodes are compatible graphs, the collage of these two nodes generate the father node, and every leaf node of the
tree is a simple block - Ck graph which nl ≤ f (k). Note that the size of each node
is smaller than the size of the original graph Ck and that the number of nodes of the decomposition tree is a linear function of n. In addition, the size of each leaf node is smaller than f (k). Hence, for fixed k, we can devise a decomposition-based

polynomial-time algorithm that total-color a power of cycle Ck
by attributing to

each leaf a total-coloring that is compatible with the coloring of its sibling node. An appropriate use of data structures and refined complexity analysis and would actually show that such algorithm is linear in n assuming fixed k.


Conclusion
In this work, we proved that if n is bigger than a given threshold then every graph Ck with even k is Type 1. Our result is actually stronger, as we prove the TCC for such graphs and give a linear time optimal algorithm to total color them. The result proves asymptotically the conjecture proposed by Campos and de Mello [4], reducing to a small number the graphs that are still unknown to satisfy the conjecture. Our results are illustrated in Figure 5, which combined with Figure 1 shows the contribution of our results to the state of the art on total coloring power of cycle graphs.
In addition to our main results for even k, for odd k we also have computational results for specific values of k, namely k = 5 and k = 7. These results point to a path to follow towards a more general technique which can also be applied for odd k.
All techniques presented in this work can be expanded: we can extend the set of graphs colored by the technique presented in Section 3 by simply increasing the size of the seed set used to generate the total colorings. As Definition 2.2 does not present any restriction on the number of colors, the same idea can be used to prove the TCC as well, by giving Δ(G) + 2-compatible total colorings. The framework presented in Section 4 can be extended to totally color other classes of graphs, mostly the classes of graphs that have similar structural decomposition, for example circulant graphs.
The total coloring tree decomposition proposed in this paper for power of cycles is closed related to the notion of tree decomposition, as well as treewidth, defined by Robertson and Seymour [11]. Therefore, another interesting direction would be to extend our technique in order to improve the state of art of the total-coloring problem for classes of graphs with bounded treewidth.
