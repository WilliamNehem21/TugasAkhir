Abstract
We establish some results on the Wadge degrees and on the Boolean hierarchy of k-partitions of some spaces, where k is a natural number. The main attention is paid to the Baire space, Baire domain and their close relatives. For the case of Δ0-measurable k-partitions the structures of Wadge degrees are characterized completely. For many degree structures, undecidability of the first-order theories is shown, for any k ≥ 3.
Keywords: Baire space, Baire domain, Wadge reducibility, k-partition, discrete weak semilattice, forest, homomorphic preorder.

Introduction
The Wadge reducibility of subsets of the Baire space [21,22] is a classical object of descriptive set theory. In this paper we consider a generalization of the Wadge reducibility from the case of subsets A of a topological space X (identified with the characteristic functions cA : X → {0, 1}) to the case of k-partitions ν : X → k of X (such functions ν are in a natural bijective correspondence with tuples (A0,..., Ak−1) of pairwise disjoint sets with A0 ∪ · · ·∪ Ak−1 = X) for an integer k ≥ 2 which is identified with the set {0,...,k−1}. Study of the Wadge reducibility of k-partitions was initiated in [3,5,6,14,15,17,20].
We establish some results on the Wadge degrees and on the Boolean hierarchy of k-partitions of some spaces, where k is a natural number. The main attention is paid to the Baire space, Baire domain and their close relatives. For the case of Δ0-measurable k-partitions the structures of Wadge degrees are characterized completely. For many degree structures, undecidability of the first-order theories is shown, for any k ≥ 3. We omit the proofs in this conference version.

We start in Section 2 with introducing some notation. In Sections 3 and 4 we describe some relevant classes of posets, remind some known and establish some new observations about them. Section 5 recalls definition and properties of the Boolean hierarchy of k-partitions. In Section 6 we discuss some substructures of the structure of Wadge degrees in the Baire and Cantor spaces. In Section 7 we establish some facts on the Wadge reducibility in two natural classes of ω-algebraic domains while in Section 8 we provide additional information about this structure in the Baire and Cantor domains. We conclude in Section 9 with a short discussion and open questions.

Notation
Levels of the Borel hierarchy in a space X are denoted Σ0 , Π0 , Δ0 , for α < ω1, so,
α	α	α
in particular, Π0 = co-Σ0 is the set of complements for Σ0 -sets and Δ0 = Σ0 ∩ Π0 .
α	α	α	α	α	α
By B we denote the class of Borel sets. If the space is not clear from the context, we may use more exact notation like Σ0 (X) or B(X).
Let X be a space, μ, ν : X → k be k-partitions of X and C a class of k-partitions of X. We say that μ is Wadge reducible to ν (in symbols, μ ≤W ν) if μ = ν ◦ f for some continuous function f on X. For k = 2 this definition coincides with the Wadge reducibility of subsets of X. Let C ≤W ν denote that any element of C is Wadge reducible to ν, and ν ≡W C denote that ν is Wadge complete in C, i.e. ν ∈C and C ≤W ν.
Since for many natural spaces (e.g., for the space of reals) the structure of Wadge degrees of Δ0 is complicated [6] we restrict our attention mainly to the Baire space, Baire domain and some of their close relatives. For such spaces we give a complete characterization of the structure of Wadge degrees of Δ0-measurable k-partitions. We extend the main facts about the Hausdorff difference hierarchy of sets in the Baire space [7] and in the ω-algebraic domains [16] to the case of k-partitions. We also show that many substructures of the Wadge degrees of k-partitions have undecidable first-order theories for k ≥ 3. Recall that ﬁrst-order theory FO(A) of a structure A of signature σ is the set of first-order sentences of signature σ which are true in A. A theory of signature σ is hereditary undecidable if any of its subtheories of the same signature σ is undecidable. Of course, any hereditary undecidable theory is undecidable.
We use standard set-theoretic notation. The class of subsets of X is denoted P (X). For any class C ⊆ P (X), let co-C be the class of all complements of sets in C, BC(C) the Boolean closure of C and Ck the set of C-partitions (or, more exactly, C-measurable k-partitions), i.e. partitions ν ∈ kX such that ν−1(i) ∈ C for each i < k. We assume the reader to be familiar with the notion of ordinal, in particular with the first non-countable ordinal ω1.
Let us recall definition of the Baire and Cantor spaces and domains that are of primary importance for mathematics and computer science. Let ω∗ be the set of finite sequences (strings) of natural numbers. Let ω+ be the set of finite non-empty strings of natural numbers. The empty string is denoted by ∅, the concatenation of

strings σ, τ by σ-τ or just by στ . By σ ± τ we denote that the string σ is an initial segment of the string τ (please be careful in distinguishing ± and ⊆). Let ωω be the set of all infinite sequences of natural numbers (i.e., of all functions ξ : ω → ω). For σ ∈ ω∗ and ξ ∈ ωω, we write σ ± ξ to denote that σ is an initial segment of the sequence ξ. Define a topology on ωω by taking arbitrary unions of sets of the form
{ξ ∈ ωω | σ ± ξ}, σ ∈ ω∗, as open sets. The space ωω with this topology is known as the Baire space, and the subspace 2ω of ωω is known as the Cantor space. It is well known that 2ω is homeomorphic to the space nω for each n, 2 ≤ n < ω.
The Baire domain is the set ω≤ω = ω∗ ∪ωω of finite and infinite strings of natural numbers, with the unions of sets of the form {ξ ∈ ω≤ω | σ ± ξ}, σ ∈ ω∗, as open sets. For any 2 ≤ n < ω, the Cantor domain is the set n≤ω = n∗ ∪ nω of finite and infinite words over the alphabet n considered as the subspace of the Baire domain. Note that the Cantor domains n≤ω and m≤ω are not homeomorphic for distinct n and m.
We use some standard notation and terminology on partially ordered sets (posets) which may be found e.g. in [2]. We will not be very cautious when applying notions about posets also to preorders; in such cases we mean the corresponding quotient-poset of the preorder. A poset (P ; ≤) will be often shorter denoted just by
P . Any subset of a poset P may be considered as a poset with the induced partial order. In particular, this applies to the “upper cones” xˇ = {y ∈ P | x ≤ y} defined by any x ∈ P . A well preorder is a preorder P that has neither infinite descending
chains nor infinite antichains. For such preorders (as well as for the well-founded preorders) there is a canonical rank function rkP assigning ordinals to the elements of P ; rank of P is by definition the supremum of ranks of its elements. With any
well preorder P we associate also its width w(P ) defined as follows: if P has an-
tichains with any finite number of elements, then w(P ) = ω, otherwise w(P ) is the greatest natural number n for which P has an antichain with n elements.
We conclude this section with introducing some more special terminology. By a base in X we mean a class L⊆ P (X) closed under finite unions and intersections. A
base L is a σ-base if it is closed also under countable unions. As is well-known, any level Σ0 , α > 0, of the Borel hierarchy in X is a σ-base. A base L is reducible if it has
the reduction property [7], i.e. for all C0, C1 ∈L there are disjoint C' , C' ∈L such
0	1
that C' ⊆ Ci for both i < 2 and C0 ∪ C1 = C' ∪ C' . A base L is σ-reducible, if for
i	0	1
each countable sequence C0, C1,... in L there is a countable sequence C' , C' ,... in L
0	1
(called a reduct of C0, C1,.. .) such that C' ∩C' for all i /= j and	C' =	Ci.
It is well-known [7] that any class Σ0 , α > 1, is σ-reducible. For the class Σ0 of open
α	1
sets the situation is more subtle: it is σ-reducible for some natural spaces (e.g., for the Baire and Cantor spaces and domains) while it is not reducible for some other natural spaces (e.g., for the space of reals).

Discrete Weak Semilattices
In this section we summerize some auxiliary algebraic notions and facts. Recall that semilattice is a structure (P ; ≤, ∪) consisting of a preorder (P ; ≤) and a binary

operation ∪ of supremum in (P ; ≤) (thus, we consider only upper semilattices). By σ-semilattice we mean a semilattice in which every countable set of elements has a supremum. With a slight abuse of notation, we apply the operation ∪ also to finite non-empty subsets of P . This causes no problem because the supremum of any non-empty finite set is unique ap to equivalence relation ≡ induced by ≤.
We start with a definition which is a slight modification of the corresponding notions introduced in [12,13].
Definition 3.1 Let I be a non-empty set. By I-discrete weak semilattice (dws, for short) we mean a structure (P ; ≤, {Pi}i∈I ) with Pi ⊆ P such that:
(P ; ≤) is a preorder;
for all n < ω, x0,..., xn ∈ P and i ∈ I there exists ui = ui(x0,..., xn) ∈ Pi which is a supremum for x0,..., xn in Pi, i.e. ∀j ≤ n(xj ≤ ui) and for any y ∈ Pi with ∀j ≤ n(xj ≤ y) it holds ui ≤ y;
for all n < ω, x0,..., xn ∈ P , i /= i' ∈ I and y ∈ Pi' , if y ≤ ui(x0,..., xn) then y ≤ xj for some j ≤ n.
By σ-dws we mean a dws (P ; ≤, P0,..., Pk−1) that has the same properties also for all ω-sequences x0, x1,... in P .
Throughout the paper, we are interested in the case when I = k for some integer k ≥ 2; in this case we write the dws also in the form (P ; ≤, P0,..., Pk−1). Note that the operations ui above may be considered as n-ary operations on P for each n > 0 (in σ-dws’s even as ω-ary operations). These operations are associative and commutative. The following properties of dws’s are immediate (see [12,13]).
Proposition 3.2 Let (P ; ≤, P0,..., Pk−1) be a dws and y, x0,..., xn ∈ P0 ∪· · · ∪
Pk−1.
If xj ≤ y for all j ≤ n then ui(x0,..., xn) ≤ y for some i < k.
If y ≤ ui(x0,x..., xn) for all i < k then y ≤ xj for some j ≤ n.
If {x0,..., xn} has no greatest element then it has no supremum in P0 ∪
··· ∪ Pk−1.
Note that if (P ; ≤, P0,..., Pk−1) is a σ-dws then the last proposition holds true also for ω-sequences x0, x1,... ∈ P0 ∪· · · ∪ Pk−1.
The next easy assertion shows that considering of only binary operations ui is sufficient to recover the structure of a dws.
Proposition 3.3 (i) Let (P ; ≤, P0,..., Pk−1) be a dws. Then the binary operations u0,..., uk−1 on P have for all x, y, z, t ∈ P and distinct i, j < k the following properties: x, y ≤ ui(x, y); x, y ≤ ui(z, t) → ui(x, y) ≤ ui(z, t); uj(z, t) ≤ ui(x, y) → (uj(z, t) ≤ y ∨ uj(z, t) ≤ z).
Let (P ; ≤) be a preorder and u0,..., uk−1 binary operations on P satisfying the properties in (i). Then (P ; ≤, P0,..., Pk−1), where Pi = {ui(x, y) | x, y ∈ P}, is a dws.
The maps (P ; ≤, P0,..., Pk−1) '→ (P ; ≤, u0,..., uk−1) and back are inverses of each other, up to isomorphism of the quotient-structures.

By the last proposition, we may apply the term “dws” also to the structures (P ; ≤, u0,..., uk−1) satisfying the three properties in (i). Note that the class of dws’s written in this form is universally axiomatizable, so any substructure of a dws (P ; ≤, u0,..., uk−1) is also a dws.
Note that for any dws the unary operations ui are closure operators on (P ; ≤), i.e. they satisfy ∀x(x ≤ ui(x)), ∀x∀y(x ≤ y → ui(x) ≤ ui(y)) and ∀x(ui(ui(x)) ≤ ui(x)). They have also the discreteness property: ∀x∀y(ui(x) ≤ uj(y) → ui(x) ≤ y), for all i /= j. This shows a close relation of dws’s to the semilattices with discrete closures (dc-semilattices, for short) introduced in [13].

Definition 3.4 By semilattice with discrete closures (dc-semilattice for short) we mean a structure (S; ≤, ∪, p0,..., pk−1) satisfying the following axioms:
(S; ∪) is an upper semilattice, i.e.  it satisfies (x ∪ y) ∪ z = x ∪ (y ∪ z), x ∪ y = y ∪ x and x ∪ x = x, for all x, y, z ∈ S.
≤ is the partial order on S induced by ∪, i.e. x ≤ y iff x ∪ y = y, for all
x, y ∈ S.
Every pi, i < k, is a closure operation on (S; ≤), i.e. it satisfies x ≤ pi(x), x ≤ y → pi(x) ≤ pi(y) and pi(pi(x)) ≤ pi(x), for all x, y ∈ S.
The operations pi have the following discreteness property: for all distinct
i, j < k, pi(x) ≤ pj(y) → pi(x) ≤ y, for all x, y ∈ S.
Every pi(x) is join-irreducible, i.e. pi(x) ≤ y ∪ z → (pi(x) ≤ y ∨ pi(x) ≤ z), for all x, y, z ∈ S.
By dcσ-semilattice we mean a dc-semilattice (S; ≤, ∪, p0,..., pk−1) such that (S; ∪) isa σ-semilattice and the axiom 5) of dc-semilattices holds also for supremums of countable subsets of S, i.e. pi(x) ≤  j<ω yj implies that pi(x) ≤ yj for some j < ω; we express this by saying that pi(x) is σ-join-irreducible.
The next easy assertion shows that dws’s that are semilattices essentially coin- cide with the dc-semilattices.
Proposition 3.5 (i) Let (P ; ≤, P0,..., Pk−1) be a dws and (P ; ≤, ∪) is a semilat- tice. Then the structure (P ; ≤, ∪, u0,..., uk−1) with the unary operations ui on P is a dc-semilattice.
If (P ; ≤, ∪, p0,..., pk−1) is a dc-semilattice then (P ; ≤, P0,..., Pk−1), where
Pi = {pi(x) | x ∈ P} is a dws.
The maps (P ; ≤, ∪, P0,..., Pk−1) '→ (P ; ≤, ∪, u0,..., uk−1)) and back are inverses of each other, up to isomorphism of the quotient-structures.
Similar relationship exists between dcσ-semilattices and σ-dws’s.

In [19] it was shown that most non-trivial dws’s have undecidable first-order theories. In particular, the following fact holds true.
Proposition 3.6 Let k ≥ 3 and P be a dws that is not linearly ordered. Then
FO(P ) is hereditary undecidable.

The Homomorphic Preorder
In this section we recall some definitions and facts about the so called homomorphic preorders studied in [5,6,8,9,14,17,10,11], and make some additional remarks. The homomorphic preorders provide minimal models for some theories discussed in the previous section. Most posets considered here are assumed to be (at most) countable and without infinite chains. The absence of infinite chains in a poset (P ; ≤) is of course equivalent to well-foundednes of both (P ; ≤) and (P ; ≥).
By a forest we mean a poset without infinite chains in which every upper cone xˇ is a chain. A tree is a forest having the biggest element (called the root of the tree). Let (T ; ≤) be a tree without infinite chains; in particular, it is well-founded. As for each well-founded partial order, there is a canonical rank function rkT from T to ordinals defined by rkT (x) = sup{rkT (y)+1 | y < x}. The rank rk(T ) of (T ; ≤) is by definition the ordinal rkT (r), where r is the root of (T ; ≤). It is well-known that rank of any countable tree without infinite chains is a countable ordinal, and any countable ordinal is the rank of such a tree. Since (ω∗; ±) is the infinite branching tree, any tree (resp., forest) (P ; ≤) without infinite chains is isomorphic to a tree (resp., forest) (P '; ±) where P' is an initial segment of (ω∗; ±) (resp., of (ω+; ±))
A k-poset is a triple (P ; ≤, c) consisting of a poset (P ; ≤) and a labeling c : P → k. Rank of a k-tree (or a k-poset) (T ; ≤, c) is by definition the rank of (T ; ≤). A morphism f : (P ; ≤, c) → (P '; ≤', c') between k-posets is a monotone function f : (P ; ≤) → (P '; ≤') respecting the labelings, i.e. satisfying c = c' ◦ f . Let Уk, Jk, 7k and 7 i denote the classes of all countable k-posets, countable k-forests, countable k-trees and countable i-rooted k-trees without infinite chains, respectively. The homomorphic preorder ≤ on Уk is defined as follows: (P, ≤, c) ≤ (P ', ≤', c'), if there is a morphism from (P, ≤, c) to (P ', ≤', c'). Let Уk, Jk, 7k and 7 i be the subsets of the corresponding tilde-sets formed by finite posets only. Note that the empty poset ∅ is assumed to be in Jk but not in 7k; it is the smallest element of (Уk; ≤).
As observed in [8,14], the structure (Уk; ≤) has for k > 2 infinite antichains and infinite descending chains. In contrast, the following result from [17] shows that the structure of k-forests has much better properties. This is of interest for our topic because the structure is closely related to the Wadge reducibility of k-partitions. We call a k-tree (T ; ≤, c) ∈ 7k repetition free if c(x) /= c(y) whenever y is an immediate successor of x in (T ; ≤).
Proposition 4.1 (i) For any k ≥ 2, (Jk; ≤) is a well preorder of rank ω1.
For any k ≥ 2, (Jk; ≤) is an initial segment of (Jk; ≤) that consists exactly of the elements of ﬁnite rank.
w(J2) = 2 and w(Jk) = ω for k > 2.
For any k ≥ 2, the quotient structure of (Jk; ≤) is a distributive lattice and a σ-semilattice.
Every T ∈ 7˜k is equivalent to some repetition free S ∈ 7˜k.
Let P H Q be the join of k-posets P, Q and  i Pi = P0 H P1 H · · · the join of an infinite sequence P0, P1,... of k-posets. For a k-forest F and i < k, let pi(F )

be the k-tree obtained from F by adjoining a new biggest element and assigning the label i to this element. It is clear that the introduced operations respect the homomorphic equivalence and that any finite (countable) k-forest is equivalent to a finite (respectively, countable) term of signature {H, p0,..., pk−1, 0,...,k — 1} without free variables (the constant symbol i in the signature is interpreted as the singleton tree carrying the label i). For k-trees T0, T1,... and i < k, define the k-tree Ui(T0, T1,.. .) = pi(T0 H T1 H· · ·). The following facts were observed in [14,17].
Proposition 4.2 (i) The quotient structure of (Jk; H, p0,..., pk−1) (resp., of
(Jk; H, p0,..., pk−1)) is a dcσ-semilattice (resp., a dc-semilattice).
(ii) The quotient structure of (7˜k; ≤, 7˜0,..., 7˜k−1) (of (7k; ≤, 7 0,..., 7 k−1)) is

The following result shows that the structures from Proposition 4.2 have natural minimality properties. The assertion (i) was proved in [17], the proof of (i) is similar.
In [10,11] some facts about definability, automorphisms and undecidability in the introduced structures were established, e.g.:
Proposition 4.3 For any k ≥ 3, each element of the quotient structure of (Jk; ≤
, 0,...,k — 1) is ﬁrst-order deﬁnable. The same is true for the quotient structure of
(7k; ≤, 0,...,k — 1).
In a forthcoming paper by O. Kudinov, A. Zhukov and the author we will show that similar definability result holds true also for (Jk; ≤, 0,...,k — 1) and (7k; ≤
, 0,...,k — 1), only in this case we have to replace first-order definability by Lω1,ω - definability.
Let Sk be the symmetric group on k elements, i.e. the group of permutations of the elements 0,...,k—1. Let Aut(A) denote the automorphism group of a structure
A. By  we denote the isomorphism relation. The next result is a straightforward generalization of the corresponding fact in [11].
Proposition 4.4 (i) For any k ≥ 2 we have Aut(Jk; ≤)   Aut(7k; ≤) and
Aut(J˜k; ≤)  Aut(7˜k; ≤).
Aut(72; ≤)  Sω and Aut(7˜2; ≤)  Sω1 .
For any k ≥ 3, Aut(Jk; ≤)  Sk  Aut(J˜k; ≤).
For all k ≥ 2 and i < k, Aut(7 i; ≤)  Sk−1  Aut(7˜i; ≤).
The next fact strengthens Proposition 3.6 for the structures considered here. The the first assertion established in [10], the second one is checked in a straightforward way.
Proposition 4.5 (i) For all k > 2 and i < k, the ﬁrst-order theories of the quotient structures of (Jk; ≤), (7 i; ≤) and (7k; ≤) are computably isomorphic to the ﬁrst- order arithmetic FO(ω, +, ·).
(ii) For all k > 2 and i < k, the theory FO(ω; +, ·) is m-reducible to any of the theories FO(J˜k; ≤), FO(7˜k; ≤), FO(7˜i; ≤).

The Boolean Hierarchy
In this section we recall definitions and some facts related to the Boolean hierarchy of k-partitions studied for the case of finite k-posets in [8,9,14] and for the countable case in [17,20].
Let P = (P ; ≤) be a countable poset without infinite chains, X a space and L a σ-base in X (see Section 1). Functions of the form S : P →L are called P -families and are denoted also by {Sp}p∈P . A P -family is monotone if it is a monotone function from (P ; ≤) into (L; ⊆). A P -family S is admissible if   S  = X and Sp ∩ Sq =  {Sr | r ≤ p, q} for all p, q ∈ P . Note that any admissible P -family
is monotone. Note also that if P is a forest then P -family S is admissible iff it is monotone,  p Sp = X and Sp ∩ Sq = ∅ for all p, q incomparable in P . For any P -family S, define a map S˜ : P → P (X) by S˜p = Sp \  q<p Sq. It is easy to see that if S is admissible then {S˜p}p∈P is a partition of X.
For a countable k-poset (P, c) without infinite chains, let L[P, c] = {c ◦ S˜ | S ∈ H(P, L)} where H(P, L) is the set of admissible P -families and S˜ is identified with the function from X to P sending x ∈ X to the unique p ∈ P with x ∈ S˜p. Note that L[P, c] ⊆ kX , i.e. L(P, c) is a class of k-partitions of X. The Boolean hierarchy of k-partitions over L is by definition the family {L[P ]}P∈Pe ; by BHk(L) we denote
the collection {L[P ] | P ∈ Уk} of levels of this hierarchy. We consider also a smaller collection of classes of k-partitions FBHk(L) = {L[P ] | P ∈ Jk} defined by the k-forests.
In [8,17] it was observed that levels of the Boolean hierarchy are closely related to the homomorphic preorder, namely for all countable k-posets P and Q without infinite chains P ≤ Q implies L(P ) ⊆ L(Q). Since, by the preceding section, the homomorphic preorder of k-posets is far from being a well preorder, the Boolean hierarchy of k-partitions defined above do not in general have properties one expects from a hierarchy. In [14,17] it was shown that the situation is better for the Boolean hierarchies over σ-reducible bases.

Proposition 5.1 Over any σ-reducible σ-base L, BHk(L) = FBHk(L), and hence the poset (BHk(L); ⊆) is a well preorder of rank ≤ ω1.

The last result applies to the base L = Σ0 of open sets in the Baire and Cantor spaces because this base is well-known to be σ-reducible (see Theorem 22.16 in [7]). For k = 2, the Boolean hierarchy over this base coincides with the Hausdorff difference hierarchy. For k ≥ 3 we obtain an extension of the difference hierarchy of sets to the case of k-partitions considered in [20]).
The next easy fact establishes the reduction property for the Baire and Cantor domains.

Proposition 5.2 The base Σ0 of open sets in the Baire and Cantor domains is
σ-reducible.

Baire and Cantor Spaces
Here we consider the Wadge reducibility of k-partitions for the Baire and Can- tor spaces. To our knowledge, the first result about the Wadge reducibility of k-partitions of the Baire and Cantor spaces is Theorem 3.2 in [3]. The following assertion is a particular case of that theorem.
Proposition 6.1 Let X ∈ {ωω, 2ω}. Then the structure (B(X); ≤W ) of Borel- measurable k-partitions is a well preorder.
This assertion gives important information about the structure (B(X); ≤W ) but it leaves open many questions. Let us introduce some algebraic structure on this preorder. Define an operation μ ⊕ ν on k-partitions of ωω by (μ ⊕ ν)(0 · ξ) = ν(ξ) and (μ ⊕ ν)(i · ξ) = ν(ξ) for all 0 < i < ω and ξ ∈ ωω. For a sequence ν0, ν1,... of k-partitions of ωω, define the k-partition ν =  i<ω νi by ν(i · ξ) = νi(ξ), for all i < ω and ξ ∈ ωω. Note that the definition of the binary join operation μ ⊕ ν applies also to the Cantor space but the ω-ary one does not. This leads to some minor distinctions in the structures of Wadge degrees.
For a k-partition ν of ωω and i < k, define a k-partition pi(ν) of ωω as follows: [pi(ν)](ξ) = i, if ξ /∈ 0∗1ωω, and [pi(ν)](ξ) = ν(η), if ξ = 0n1η (here we use the self-evident notation in the style of regular expressions in automata theory). Note that the definition of pi applies also to the Cantor space.
The next fact was established in [14,17].

Proposition 6.2 (i) The quotient structures of (kωω ; ≤
, ⊕,p ,...,p 
) and of

W	0	k−1
((Δ0)k; ≤W , ⊕, p0,..., pk−1) in the Baire space are dcσ-semilattices, and in the Can-
tor space they are dc-semilattices.
(ii) The quotient structure of ((BC(Σ0))k; ≤W , ⊕, p0,..., pk−1) in the Baire and
Cantor spaces is a dc-semilattice.
Now we turn to characterizing of some ideals of the Wadge preorder in the Baire space. Adjoining a new smallest element ⊥ to ((Δ0)k with pi(⊥) = i we obtain (by Proposition 6.2) a dcσ-semilattice ((Δ0)k ∪ {⊥}; ≤W , ⊕, p0,..., pk−1). By Proposition 6.2, there is a natural embedding μ : Jk → (Δ0)k ∪ {⊥} of dcσ- semilattices with μ(∅) = ⊥. For a proof of the next result see [20].
Theorem 6.3 The map μ induces an isomorphism of the quotient structure of
(J˜k \ {∅}; ≤, H, p0,..., pk−1) onto that of ((Δ0(ωω))k; ≤W , ⊕, p0,..., pk−1). More-
over, μ(F ) ≡W Σ0[F ] for each F ∈ Jk.
Note that from earlier unpublished work of P. Hertling (see Satz 6.2 b) in [5] and Theorem 2.2.4 in [6]) it follows that the the quotient structures of and are isomorphic. From the results above it follows that μ induces such an isomorphism and preserves the operations p0,..., pk−1. Thus, we have
Theorem 6.4 Let X ∈ {ωω, 2ω}. Then the quotient structure of the structure
((BC(Σ0))k; ≤W , ⊕, p0,..., pk−1) is isomorphic to that of (Jk; ≤, H, p0,..., pk−1).
The next result follows from Theorem 8.1, Corollary 6.4 and Proposition 4.4.

Corollary 6.5 For the Baire and Cantor spaces there hold:

The next result follows from Theorem 8.1, Corollary 6.4 and proposition 4.5.
Corollary 6.6 For the Baire and Cantor spaces there hold:
For any k ≥ 3, the theory FO((BC(Σ0))k; ≤W ) is undecidable and, moreover, it is computably isomorphic to the ﬁrst-order arithmetic FO(ω; +, ·).
For any k ≥ 3, FO((Δ0)k; ≤W ) is undecidable and, moreover, the theory
FO(ω; +, ·) is m-reducible to FO((Δ0)k; ≤W ).
We conclude this section with a characterization of Δ0-measurable k-partitions ν in terms of their ranks rk(ν) in the well preorder ((B(ωω))k; ≤W ). We consider only the Baire space; a slightly different proof establishes the similar fact for the Cantor space. We omit the proof in this conference version of the paper.
Theorem 6.7 Let ν be a Borel measurable k-partition of the Baire space.
ν is Δ0-measurable iff rk(ν) < ω1.
ν is BC(Σ0)-measurable iff rk(ν) < ω.
Wadge Reducibility in Domains
Here we discuss the Wadge reducibility in the ω-algebraic domains that are central objects of the domain theory (for definitions and general properties of these objects see e.g. [1]). For an ω-algebraic domain X, let F (X) denote the countable set of finitary (or compact) elements. The specialization order is denoted by ≤, and the bottom element of (X; ≤) is denoted by ⊥.
Let X be an ω-algebraic domain. A set A ⊆ X is called approximable [15] if for
any x ∈ A there is a finitary element p ≤ x with [p, x] ⊆ A, where [p, x] = {y ∈ X|p ≤ y ≤ x}. Call a k-partition ν of X approximable if ν−1(i) is approximable for each i < k. By a repetition-free ω-chain for ν we mean a sequence {pn}n<ω of finitary elements such that p0 ≤ p1 ≤ ... and ν(pn) /= ν(pn+1) for each n < ω.
The next fact follows from results in [16].
Proposition 7.1 Let X be an ω-algebraic domain and ν a k-partition of X.
ν is Δ0-measurable iff ν is approximable.
If ν is Δ0-measurable then it has no repetition-free ω-chain.
Let X be an ω-algebraic domain, ν a k-partition of X and T = (T, ≤, t) ∈ 7k. By a ν-representation of T we mean a monotone function g : (T ; ≤) → (F (X); ≤) such that t = ν ◦ g; T is ν-representable if there exists a ν-representation of T . The next result is straightforward.

Proposition 7.2 Let X be an ω-algebraic domain T = (T, ≤, t) ∈
k-partition of X. If T is ν-representable then Σ0[T ] ≤W ν.
The proof of the next technical fact is omitted.

Proposition 7.3 Let X be an ω-algebraic domain and ν a Δ0-measurable k- partition of X. Then there exists a ν-representable T ∈ 7k such that S ≤ T for each ν-representable S ∈ 7˜k.
Next we discuss two classes of ω-algebraic domains introduced and studied in [15]. By a reflective domain we mean an ω-algebraic domain X such that for some continuous functions q0, e0, q1, e1 : X → X there hold q0e0 = q1e1 = idX , and e0(X), e1(X) are disjoint open sets. Examples of reflective domains are the Baire and Cantor domains, the domain ωω of partial functions g : ω - ω, and many other natural (in particular, functional) domains, see [15].
Define continuous functions sk, rk(k < ω) on X by s0 = e0, sk+1 = e1sk and r0 = q0, rk+1 = rkq1. Let also Dk = sk(X). In [15] we observed that in any reflective domain X the following properties of the introduced objects hold true: for any k < ω, rksk = idX ; the sets Dk are open, pairwise disjoint and satisfy Dk = {x|sk(⊥) ≤ x}; {∪kDk, D0, D1 .. .} is a partition of X.
For any i < k, define an operation ui sending sequences of k-partitions ν0, ν1,... 
of X to k-partitions of X by letting ui = ui(ν0, ν1,.. .) to be the map

ui(x) = ⎧⎨
i	if x /∈  k Dk

⎩ νkrk(x) if x ∈ Dk.
In [15] we observed that the operations ui witness the following
Proposition 7.4 Let X be a reflective domain and Уi = {ν ∈ kX | ν(⊥) = i} for any i < k. Then (kX ; ≤W , {Уs}s∈S) is a σ-dws.
Note that, by Section 3, any subset of kX closed under u0,..., uk−1 is a σ-dws as well. In particular, this applies to Δ0 -measurable k-partitions for α ≥ 2 and to BC(Σ0 )-measurable k-partitions for α ≥ 1. The next result generalizes Theorem
5.8 in [15] from the case of sets to the case of k-partitions.
Theorem 7.5 In any reflective domain X, the Boolean hierarchy of k-partitions does not collapse, i.e., for all S, T ∈ 7˜k, Σ0[S] ⊆ Σ0[T ] iff S ≤ T . Moreover, any

Baire and Cantor Domains
In this section we consider in more detail the Wadge reducibility of k-partitions of the Baire and Cantor domains. Since these domains are reflective, the results of the previous section apply to them. The main result of this section is the following
Theorem 8.1 Let X be the Baire or a Cantor domain. Then the quotient structure of ((Δ0(X))k; ≤W ) is isomorphic to the quotient structure of (7˜k; ≤).
Restricting the last theorem to the finite k-trees we obtain
Corollary 8.2 Let X be the Baire or a Cantor domain. Then the quotient structure of (7k; ≤) is isomorphic to that of ((BC(Σ0(X)))k; ≤W ).

The next result follows from Theorem 8.1, Corollary 8.2 and Proposition 4.4.

Corollary 8.4 Let X be the Baire or a Cantor domain.
For any k ≥ 3, the theory FO((BC(Σ0(X)))k; ≤W ) is computably isomorphic
to the ﬁrst-order arithmetic FO(ω; +, ·).
For any k ≥ 3, FO(ω; +, ·) is m-reducible to FO((Δ0)(X)))k; ≤W ).
Conclusion
This paper extends essentially all previously known results on the difference hier- archy of sets in the Baire and Cantor spaces to the case of k-partitions. Several facts on the Wadge hierarchy of sets are also extended to the case of k-partitions. Interestingly, many natural substructures of the structure of Wadge degrees become undecidable for k ≥ 3.
At the same time, many natural open question about the Wadge reducibility of k-partitions remain open. Though the results of Section 6 provide a complete
extension of the theory of Wadge degrees of Δ0-sets (see Section C of Chapter I of
[22]) to the Δ0-measurable k-partitions, very little is known outside this class. We believe that actually all the main facts about the Wadge reducibility of Borel sets in [22] may be lifted to the case of k-partitions but this of course requires a lot of additional work.
Section 8 develops a complete theory of the Boolean hierarchy and of the Wadge reducibility of Δ0-measurable k-partitions in the Baire and Cantor domains. Beyond this class, almost nothing is known. In particular, we do not currently know whether the structure of Borel (or even Δ0) sets in the Baire domain is a well preorder.
