This paper presents a single-layer dual-polarized filtering antenna with good out-of-band suppression. By using inherent characteristic of the patch’s eigenmode and meanwhile merging four filtering strategies, i.e., parasitic patches, slot on the driving patch, and defected ground structure (DGS), a low-profile filter- ing antenna design with five radiation nulls has been realized. With the designed filtering antenna, a con- ventional 1×2 array with a spacing of 0.91k is first developed. In order to reduce the sidelobe level of the array, a sharing patching scheme is introduced to decrease the interspace between the elements as 0.44k, with the same physical size as the conventional array. In addition, a concept to measure total isolation between two kinds of the polarized ports in the array, i.e., SddVH, has been derived for the first time. The prototype of the proposed array is fabricated with a profile of 0.038k. Measured results indicate that the designed novel array has an operational band of 3.53–4.06 GHz, SddVH better than 41 dB, a sidelobe level below —18 dB, and a suppression level above 20 dB with the stopband up to 0.5 GHz and 5 GHz.

Introduction

With the rapid development of the fifth-generation (5G) mobile communication system and space-borne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) system, more and more communication frequency bands and standards have been put forward, inevitably leading to electro- magnetic interference and crosstalk. Therefore, as shown in Fig. 1, it is necessary for the transceiver system to have an ability to filter out the interference. Wireless communication system and space- borne SAR system have the trend of miniaturization and integra- tion, which imposes higher requirements on the sizes of the RF front-ends including filter, antenna, and its array.
The integration of antenna and filter is called filtering antenna, which can effectively reduce the volume and the loss of the RF front-end. The design methods of the filtering antenna can be divided into two categories. The first one is a filtering antenna with a filter as the main body. By cascading the antenna after the filter [1,2] or replacing the last stage of the filter with an antenna [3–6], the filtering characteristics are achieved to some extent. Thus, the focus of the design is biased toward the radiation performance [7,8], such as bandwidth, gain, and polarization, etc. The second kind of the filtering antennas is based on the antenna [9–22], by introducing specific structures into the feeding structure and radi-

ators of the antenna, for instance slot [10,14], parasitic patch [11,15], defected ground structure (DGS) [18,21], and so on, to achieve the frequency selectivity responses. Its design emphasis is on the frequency selectivity characteristics [17–24], including out-of-band suppression, steep roll-off, stopband width, etc. The latter design method has a higher integration than the former. However, it can be found from the published designs that when the dual-polarized filtering antenna by using the slot, parasitic patch, and DGS is designed, the multilayer structure is often employed, thus giving rise to high antenna profile.
With the filtering antenna element, design of the filtering antenna array has been a hot topic. In [13], a 1-by-3 dual- polarized filtering antenna array with an inter-element spacing of 0.5k for the base station application was designed, and mean- while two 1-to-3 power dividers are used to feed the array. The isolation between the input ports of two power dividers used to measure polarization isolation is 17 dB, and the sidelobe level of the array is 12 dB. In [20], two 1-by-6 antenna arrays fed by two 1-to-6 power dividers, respectively, was proposed to operate in DCS and WCDMA bands. By measuring the input ports of two power dividers, the isolation of two frequency bands is 35 dB. And the sidelobe level is 16 dB with the antenna spacing of 0.78k in the DCS band/0.89k in the WCDMA band. In [17], a 4-by-4 dual-polarized   array   with   a   compact   size   of
3.13k  3.13k  0.16k fed by two power dividers is designed. The
polarization isolation between the input ports of two power divi-

ders is 30 dB. However, in order to reduce the mutual coupling, an extra isolation wall was introduced, thus increasing design com- plexities. Therefore, it can be found from the reported references that the isolation of the array is measured after the array is con- nected to the power divider. The resultant isolation depends on not only antenna array itself but also the power divider. In addi- tion, how to obtain both high polarization isolation and low side- lobe is still a challenging problem in the filtering antenna array design.
In this paper, a dual-polarized filtering antenna consisting of driven patches and radiation patches and its novel low-profile array with both high polarization isolation and low sidelobe level have been proposed. The contribution of the paper has two folds. One is to fuses several filtering methods including inherent eigen- mode, parasitic patches, slot, and defected ground structure (DGS) to achieve good filtering performance without increase of the antenna profile. The second is to develop a dual-polarized filtering antenna array with both high polarization isolation and low side- lobe performance. The designed filtering antenna fabricated on a single-layer substrate, and with five radiation nulls, the resultant stopband covers GSM, CDMA and LTE bands. Based on the symme- try of the antenna structure, the interspace between the antenna elements can be reduced from 0.91k to 0.44k by sharing the radiat- ing patches, and thus sidelobe level of the proposed array decreases from 12.36 dB to 18.11 dB. In addition, the polariza- tion isolation of the array itself without the consideration of the power divider, i.e., the total isolation between two kinds of the polarized ports in the array named SddVH and SddHV, are proposed for the first time. The designed array has high polarization port iso- lation above 41.1 dB. Good agreement between the simulation and the measurement verifies the proposed design.

Filtering antenna design

patches and four square radiation patches evenly distributed around them are fabricated on the top surface of the substrate. Four pairs of slots are etched on four driven patches, and four pairs of C-shaped slots are etched on the ground to improve low- frequency and high-frequency selectivities, respectively. Two kinds of polarized waves are excited by two pairs of the differential probes connected to the driven patches. Here, the differential port I consisting of ports 1 and 3 excites x-polarization wave and the differential port II composed of ports 2 and 4 excites y- polarization wave.

Operating mechanism of filtering antenna

To clearly demonstrate the design idea and working mechanism of the proposed antenna, the design process of the antenna is shown in Fig. 3. Antenna I consists of two pairs of the chamfered rectangular patches which are placed along x and y axes, respec- tively, and are fed by two pairs of differential ports. Antenna II adds four square radiation patches placed around the driven patches. Antenna III is formed by introducing a pair of slots on each driven patch. And then, four pairs of C-shaped DGSs are introduced on the ground around the probes to form the antenna IV, i.e., the proposed antenna.
Fig. 4 gives the simulated differential S-parameter |Sdd11| and broadside gains of the antennas I IV. Here, we only discuss the case of x-polarization. Due to the symmetry of the antenna struc- ture, the same conclusions hold for the y-polarization. For a typical four-port network including two pairs of the differential ports, the widely used differential S-parameters can be written as
8> Sdd11 = (S11 — S31 — S13 + S33)/2


Various filtering antennas have been developed hitherto. Among these filtering antenna designs, a large number of dual- polarized filtering antennas have been studied, but most of them are multilayer structures, with the higher profiles [2,5,13,14,20]. In addition, a number of single-layer filtering antennas with single polarization have been proposed [10,16,19]. Here, an integrated design of a single-layer low-profile dual-polarization filtering antenna is proposed. This section includes the antenna configura- tion, the design process of the proposed antenna, and performance comparison between the simulated and measured results.

respectively, as shown in Fig. 6(a). When two patches along x axis are excited by the differential signals, i.e., two signals with the equal magnitude and 180° out of phase, the opposite electric field distributions of the eigenmode 3 on the two patches along x axis are obtained, as shown in Fig. 6(b). On the other hand, without the excitations for two patches along y axis, there are no electric fields of the eigenmode 3 on the two patches along y axis. In addi- tion, the similar operating frequencies for the eigenmode 3 and the
radiation null are observed. Therefore, the radiation null at fn1 is an inherent radiation null corresponding to the eigenmode 3.

2.2.2. Analysis of resonance and radiation null of antenna II
When the radiation patches are placed around the driven patch (antenna II), a new resonance at f2 = 3.85 GHz is excited and thus the working bandwidth is widened, as shown in Fig. 4. Meanwhile, a radiation null at fn2 = 4.25 GHz is generated to improve the high- frequency roll-off. Fig. 7 shows the surface current distributions of antenna II at f1, f2, and fn2. It can be seen that the driven patch is still in resonance at f1 = 3.5 GHz, and the radiation patch resonates at f2 = 3.85 GHz. Besides, at f2 the currents on the four radiation patches are superimposed on each other in the x direction and can-

celled out in the y direction, thus achieving the x-polarization radi- ation. The opposite current distributions on the radiation patches and the driven patches are due to the capacitive coupling between them. However, the currents flowing on the driven patches are far weaker than those on the radiation patches. It means that the energy is well coupled from the driven patches to the radiation

Analysis of resonance and radiation null of antenna I
As shown in Fig. 4, antenna I has a resonance at f1 = 3.5 GHz and a radiation null at fn1 = 1.4 GHz. Fig. 5 gives the surface current dis- tributions of the antenna I at f1 and fn1. At f1, the surface current on each of two driven patches along x-axis is maximal in the middle and zero at the two ends, and therefore the resonant mode is TM10 mode. The corresponding length of each driven patch is a quarter wavelength at f1. On the other hand, it can be observed from the surface current distribution at fn1 that the currents on the both sides of the feeding location flow in an opposite direction,
resulting in radiation cancellation in broadside direction. In order
patches. Therefore, good radiation is generated by the radiation patches at 3.85 GHz. At fn2 = 4.25 GHz, the weak currents on the radiation patches are observed, compared with those at f2. As shown in Fig. 8, an equivalent model for the coupling between the driven and radiation patch is built to investigate the operating mechanism of the radiation null at fn2. With the symmetry of the antenna, only a quarter of the whole antenna structure, i.e., a dri- ven patch and a radiation patch, is analyzed. The driven and radi- ation patches are close together, and thus can be equivalent to two parallel coupling lines with four ports, i.e., ports (i), (ii), (iii) and
(iv). It is worthwhile pointing out that the four ports different from the actual feeding ports are used to analyze the coupling effect in the parallel coupling lines. According to the even and odd analysis of the parallel coupling line in [25], when the port (i) is driven by an input voltage of 2 V0, the voltages of the ports (ii), (iii) and (iv), i.e., V2, V3 and V4, can be solved, respectively, as

where C is voltage coupling coefficient, h is the electric length of the radiation patch. Fig. 9 shows the variations of V2 and V3 with the h. It can be seen that when h = np (n = 0,1, .. .), the V3 is zero, meaning that electromagnetic energy cannot be coupled from the driven
patch to the radiation patch.
When h = p, the length of the radiation patch is equal to half of the wavelength at fn2. In this scenario, the radiation null is formed, and the corresponding frequency fn2 is obtained as
c
the fn3. In addition, there is a small convex of the gain curve between fn3 and fn4, as shown in the Fig. 11. That is due to the cou- pling between the driving patch along x direction and the driving patch along y direction which are too close together. The coupling between the driving patches can be reduced by corner-cutting to avoid sharp convex.
In order to analyze the two radiation nulls, an equivalent circuit is established, as shown in Fig. 12. Each of the driven patches appears as a shunt RLC circuit consisting of the inductor Ld, the capacitor Cd and the resistor Rd with the band-pass response. A pair of the slots is regarded as a shunt LC circuit composed of the induc- tor Ls, the capacitor Cs with the band-stop characteristic, which is connected to the RLC circuit in series. At the resonant frequency of the band-pass circuit, the impedance of the RLC circuit is the Rd, thus achieving the radiation of the driven patch. On the other hand, at the resonant frequency of the band-stop circuit, the impe- dance of the LC circuit becomes infinite. Therefore, the energy can- not be transmitted from the feeding port to the radiation resistor Rd but is concentrated around the slot, thus generating the radia-

the full-wave simulation results of 4.25 GHz.

Analysis of resonance and radiation nulls of antenna III
A pair of the slots is etched on each driven patch to form the antenna III. As shown in Fig. 4(b), the use of the slot is to introduce two adjacent radiation nulls at fn3 = 2.9 GHz and fn4 = 2.7 GHz for improvement of the low-frequency roll-off. Fig. 10 gives the sur- face current distributions of the antenna III at fn3 and fn4. At fn3 = 2.9- GHz, the currents mainly distribute near the slots of the excited driven patches along x direction. By contrast, the currents at fn4 = 2.7 GHz distribute near the slots of the driven patches along both x and y directions. Compared to the currents at fn3, the cur- rents at fn4 flow in a longer path, and thus the fn4 is lower than
In addition to the radiation null at fn3 = 2.9 GHz, there is a radi- ation null at fn4 = 2.7 GHz, which can be still analyzed according to the equivalent circuit model shown in Fig. 12. The only difference between two radiation nulls is a coupling between the excited dri- ven patches along x direction and the unexcited driven patches along y direction at fn4. Therefore, the electromagnetic energy excited by the feeding probe distributes on the slots along both x and y directions.

The operating mechanism of the DGS for the radiation null can be explained in terms of the equivalent circuit, as shown in Fig. 13. The DGS is regarded as a parallel LC circuit with a bandstop response including the inductor Lg and the capacitor Cg [26], which is cascaded before the equiva- lent circuit shown in Fig. 12.

It is worthwhile noticing that the equivalent circuit for the DGS shown in Fig. 13 is established without the considerations of the radiation patches.

Conventional 1 × 2 array design (array I)

Firstly, a conventional 1 2 antenna array is designed based on the proposed filtering antenna element with an element spacing of D = 0.91k, which is called array I, as shown in Fig. 20. Here k is wavelength at the center frequency. As shown in Fig. 21(a), a pro- totype is fabricated, and comparison of the simulated and mea- sured gains for x and y polarizations is given in Fig. 22. The measured out-of-band suppression levels for x polarization are
above 26.1 dB in low-frequency band greater than 0.5 GHz and

above 27 dB in high-frequency band up to 5 GHz, respectively, and those for y polarization are 24.1 dB and 26.4 dB in the same bands, respectively.
In order to evaluate and measure the overall polarization isola- tion performance of the antenna itself, two kinds of the polariza- tion ports in the array are considered. Specifically, all x- polarization ports are denoted as the port V, and all y- polarization ports are denoted as the port H. Thus, SddHV is the dif- ferential S parameter from the port V to the port H, and SddVH rep- resents the differential S parameter from the port H to the port V, which distinguishes them from widely used polarization isolation of the antenna array with the power divider. The SddHV and SddVH

are defined to measure the polarization purity of the ports to some extent. It is worthwhile pointing out that SddHV and SddVH are differ- ent from the cross-polarization ratio. The former is the port-related parameter, whereas the latter is radiation-related parameter. As for the array I with the port distribution shown in Fig. 20, SddVH is given as
SddVH = 1 [(S12 — S32 + S52 — S72) — (S14 — S34 + S54 — S74)
Wilkinson power divider and several power dividers with two
±90° output phase shifts. Here, microstrip-slotline-microstrip tran- sition is used to achieve the desirable phase shift. Due to different directions of the coupling from the slotline to the microstrip, two output signals of equal amplitude with a difference of ±90° are generated within the ultra-wideband. The measurement results of the phase shifter are shown in the Fig. 25. The operating band (|S11|< 10 dB) covers 1.1 GHz to 5 GHz. The |S21|, which represents the insertion loss of the phase shifter, is about 5 dB, and a nearly perfect 180° phase difference is obtained.

Improved array design (array II)

Owing to the conventional array arrangement, the sidelobe level of the above 1  2 array is high. In order to reduce the side- lobe level, the driven patches and radiation patches can be reused to decrease the interspace between the elements. Specifically, one driven patch and two radiation patches are shared between two adjacent elements, and the resulting filtering array is called array II, as shown in Fig. 26. The improved array has the same physical size as the conventional 1 × 2 array, and the corresponding ele- ment spacing is reduced from D = 0.91k to D = 0.44k. It should be noted that to better share the adjacent patches, all corners on the driven patches are cut off. Besides, it can be noticed that the ele- ments 1 and 2 at two sides of the array are exactly same, different from the element 3 in the middle of the array. Specifically, the ori- entations of the slots on driven patches and the DGS and the feed position of the element 3 are opposite to those of the elements 1 and 2. But the difference between them has no effect on the overall performance of the array II. In order to achieve the differential feeding for all elements, the used feeding scheme is shown in Fig. 27.
The array II is also fabricated and shown in Fig. 21(b). The sim- ulated and measured gains are shown in Fig. 28, in good agree- ment. For comparison, the simulated and measured results of the array I are also given. Similar gains are obtained by the arrays I and II. The measured out-of-band suppression levels for x polariza- tion are above 22.1 dB in low-frequency band greater than 0.5 GHz and above 19.7 dB in high-frequency band up to 5 GHz, respec- tively, and those for y polarization in the same bands are 24.8 dB and 23.8 dB, respectively. As shown in Fig. 29, the simulated and measured |SddVH| are 47 dB and 41.1 dB, respectively, meaning that the array II has better polarization isolation performance. Here, the SddVH of the array II is solved as

SddVH = 1 [(S12 — S32 + S52 — S72 — S92 + S102 )

Besides, Fig. 30 shows the simulated and measured normalized patterns of the array II at 3.65 GHz. The simulated and measured sidelobe levels are 20 dB and 18.11 dB, respectively, and the simulated and measured cross-polarization ratios are above 46 dB and 26 dB, respectively. As shown in Fig. 31, compared to the array I with the same physical size, the simulated and mea- sured sidelobe levels of the array II decrease by 9.1 dB and 6 dB, respectively. It is worthwhile pointing out that the proposed shar- ing patch method can be easily extended to m × n array by adding (m-1)×(n-1) elements.

Performance comparison

The proposed arrays I and II are compared with previously reported filtering antenna arrays in Table 1. It can be found from that the proposed array is highly integrated and has a low profile owing to the single layer substrate. Meanwhile, the novel array design results in a lower sidelobe level. Moreover, higher polariza- tion isolations and better cross polarization ratios are achieved, with moderate gain and suppression levels. It is worthwhile notic- ing that an extra pair of the differential ports is used in the array II,

In this paper, an integrated filtering antenna and its improved array has been presented. The single-layer dual-polarized filtering antenna element consisting of four driven patches and four radiation patches has two in-band resonances. The patches with the slots and the DGS are used to generate five controllable radiation nulls, and
thus good out-of-band suppression is achieved. The prototype of

the filtering antenna is fabricated, and the measured |Sdd21| is 41 dB with the peak gain of 10.5 dBi. With the designed filtering antenna element, a novel array is developed by sharing the radiating patches. The designed array with the same size as the conventional
1 2 array has a smaller element spacing, thus resulting in the lower sidelobe level. The array prototype is fabricated and measured. The overall isolation related to two kinds of the polarized ports in the array itself is proposed, and the measured SddVH of the improved fil- tering antenna array is 41.1 dB. As a result, the proposed filtering array is of good radiation and filtering performance, which is good candidate for the base station MIMO array in 5G applications.

Appendix

In this section, the isolation between two kinds of polarized ports in the multi-port differential network is derived. Consider a network diagram with 2n ports (n is even) shown in Fig. 32. In this
network, 2n ports are successively called as P1+ ; P1— ; P2+ ; P2— ; ··· ;
Pn+ ; Pn— . Assume that the port Pi+ and Pi— form a differential port
Di (i = 1, 2, 3, .. ., n). In this scenario, there are n differential ports

compared with the array I. The use of the extra pair of the differen- tial ports doesn’t increase the overall size of the array II and the complexities of the feeding structure. Instead, better polarization isolation can be achieved. To sum up, the improved array has the better radiation performance while remaining the filtering response, compared with the conventional filtering antenna array.
in this network. Without loss of generality, the differential ports D1, D3, D5, .. ., and Dn-1 excite x polarized wave, and the differential ports D2, D4, D6, .. ., and Dn excite y polarized wave.
Without loss of generality, we denote SddHV and SddVH as the total isolation between two kinds of the polarized ports in the array. Here, the port V is composed of the all ports which excites x polar- ized wave, and the port H consists of the all ports which excite y polarized wave. From the input port V to the output port H, one has

In the array II, some ports are reused, which is different from the conventional differential-fed arrays. As shown in Fig. 26, there are 6 differential ports, i.e., D1, D2, D3, D4, D5 and D6. The differential ports D1 ~ D4 are same as those of the array I. The D5 is composed of port P9 and P10. Besides, the ports P4 and P6 also form a differen- tial port D6 for the reuse. The port V composed of the differential ports D1, D3 and D5 excites x polarized wave, while the port H con- sisting of the differential ports D2, D4 and D6 excites y polarized wave.
