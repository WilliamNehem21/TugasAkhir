The concentrations of heavy metals (Cu, Zn, Pb, Cd, Fe and Mn) were measured in the liver, gills and muscles of fourteen benthic and pelagic fish species collected from three main landing areas (Shalateen, Hurghada and Suez) in the Egyptian Red Sea. The levels of heavy metals varied significantly among fish species and organs. As expected, muscles always possessed the lowest concentrations of all metals. In most studied fish, the liver was the target organ for Cu, Zn and Fe accumulation. Pb and Mn, however, exhibited their highest concentrations in the gills. Different species of fish showed inter-specific variation of metals, as well as variations between fish from the same species. These differences were discussed for the contribution of potential factors that affected metals' uptake, like age, geographical distribution and species' specific factors. Generally, recorded metal concen- trations were within the range or below the levels in similar species from global studies.
The concentration of metals in the present fish muscles were accepted by the international legislation limits and are safe for human consumption.

Introduction

In the recent years, world consumption of fish has increased simultaneously with the growing concern of their nutritional
and therapeutic benefits. In addition to its important source of protein, fish typically have rich contents of essential minerals, vitamins and unsaturated fatty acids [1]. The American Heart Association recommended eating fish at least twice per weak in order to reach the daily intake of omega-3 fatty acids [2].

However, fish are relatively situated at the top of the aquatic food chain; therefore, they normally can accumulate heavy metals from food, water and sediments [3,4]. The con- tent of toxic heavy metals in fish can counteract their bene- ficial effects; several adverse effects of heavy metals to human health have been known for long time [5]. This may include serious threats like renal failure, liver damage, cardiovascular diseases and even death [6,7]. Therefore, many international monitoring programs have been established in order to assess the quality of fish for human consumption and to monitor the health of the aquatic ecosystem [8].
In the last few decades, the concentrations of heavy metals in fish have been extensively studied in different parts of the world [9]. Most of these studies concentrated mainly on the heavy metals in the edible part (fish muscles). However, other studies reported the distribution of metals in different organs like the liver, kidneys, heart, gonads, bone, digestive tract and brain.
According to the literatures, metal bioaccumulation by fish and subsequent distribution in organs is greatly inter-specific. In addition, many factors can influence metal uptake like sex, age, size, reproductive cycle, swimming patterns, feeding behavior and living environment (i.e., geographical location) [4,10].
Red Sea is a semi-enclosed tropical body of water. It has been considered to be a relatively unpolluted marine envi- ronment. In the last few decades, however, evidence of heavy metal pollution has been found in various locations [12]. In the northern part of the Egyptian Red Sea, increasing population growth and industrial activities in Suez City are the main sources of heavy metal pollution. While in the southern part, the tourism industry and shipping of ores are the major sources of the anthropogenic input of heavy metals.
In Egypt, the Red Sea is of great ecological interest; it is an important source of fisheries and tourism industry. In spite of that, heavy metals' studies in the Red Sea are restricted. Relatively few studies investigated the levels of metals in
some fish species from the Red Sea [13e20]. However due to increasing anthropogenic and industrial stress on the Red Sea, continuous monitoring of the environmental conditions of the Red Sea is required.
In the present study, levels of heavy metals in the organs of some commercial fish from landing areas on the Egyptian Red Sea were determined, aiming to evaluate the current envi- ronmental status of this broad section of the Red Sea. Also metals' content in muscles were compared against the rec-
ommended maximum permissible limit (MPL) to assess the
quality of fish for human consumption.

Materials and methods

Fish sampling

Fourteen commercial fish species were purchased from local fishermen at three main fish landing areas on the Red Sea: Shalateen, Hurghada and Suez (Fig. 1) during December 2010 and January 2011. The collected species were: Epinephelus sp., Caranx sp., Scarus gibbus, Nemipterus japonicus, Sardinella sp., Synodus sp., Carangoides bajad, Lutjanus bohar, Thunnus

albacares, Gerres oyena, Sargocentron spiniferum, Siganus rivula- tus, Lethrinus sp. and Trachurus mediterraneus. These fish spe- cies represent different biotops and are economically important (Table 1).
Collected fish were immediately preserved in an ice box and transferred to the laboratory where they were classified, weighed, measured by total length and kept frozen at —20 ◦C until further analysis.

Determination of metal concentrations

Preparation of subsamples and analysis were made according to FAO Technical Paper No. 212 [21]. For metal analysis, frozen fish were partially thawed, and each fish was dissected using stainless steel instruments. Muscles, liver and gills were taken out; composite samples of 2e5 g were used for subsequent analysis.
The samples were digested with ultra pure nitric acid (and perchloric acid for gills 4:1) at 100 ◦C until the solution become clear. The solution was made up to known volume with deionized distilled water and analyzed for Cu, Zn, Pb, Cd, Fe and Mn using the Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS model GPC A932 ver. 1.1). The obtained results were expressed as mg/g wet weight.

All reagents were of analytical grade; glassware were soaked in 10% nitric acid and later rinsed with distilled water prior to use in order to avoid metal contamination.
Accuracy and precision were verified by using reference materials (MA-A-2/TM) provided by the International Atomic Agency (IAEA). Analytical results of the quality control sam- ples indicated a satisfactory performance of heavy metal determination within the range of certified values 95e111% recovery for the metals studied.

Statistical analysis

Three-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to indicate significant differences in metal levels among sites, species and organs. And one-way (ANOVA) was used to compare metals between species in single organ (significant values, p ≤ 0.05). All data were checked, beforehand, for the homo- geneity of variances and normality; the data which were not normally distributed or not homogeneous were transformed. ANOVA was followed by Duncan's multiple range test to
determine the position of the variance. All statistical calcu-
lations were carried out with SPSS 18.0 for Windows.







































Results

Concentrations of heavy metals (Cu, Zn, Pb, Cd, Fe and Mn) in the muscles, liver and gills of fish collected from landing sites (Shalateen, Hurghada and Suez) on the Red Sea are given in Tables 2e4, respectively. Accumulation patterns of all metals were significantly different (p < 0.001) between the different species, organs and sites (except for Fe) (Table 5).
As shown in Tables 2e4, all fish contained the lowest concentrations of metals in muscles, while almost all fish species showed the highest concentrations of Cu, Zn and Fe in the liver, and the highest concentrations of Pb and Mn in the gills. For Cd, the highest concentrations fluctuated between the liver in some species and gills in others. Duncan's multiple
range test indicated variations of metals as the highest levels
of Cu, Zn, Cd and Fe in the liver and the highest Pb and Mn in the gills; while muscles significantly possessed lowest con- centration of all metals.
Regarding the geographical variation of metals, there was no consistent increase of metals in all fish species from one site. However, statistically, Suez showed significantly high

concentrations of metals (Cu, Zn, Pb, Cd and Mn) when compared to other sites (Table 5).
The accumulation of metals in a single species showed significant inter-specific variations in all metals. However it
can be noticed that, different organs exhibited different pat- terns in metals accumulation. In other words, no single type of fish showed the highest metals in all organs (except Mn in Sardinella sp.). Therefore, concentrations of metals between

101






species were analyzed in single organ; all results showed significant variations between species. Furthermore, some fish from the same species collected from different sites also significantly accumulated different concentrations of metals (ANOVA: p < 0.001 in all cases). Variations of metals distribu-
tion in the studied fish can be summarized as the following:

Copper (Cu)

In the liver, the herbivore S. rivulatus accumulated the highest concentration of Cu (18.62 ± 2.52 mg/g wet wt); while another herbivore species (S. gibbus) showed the lowest values (0.76 ± 0.13 mg/g wet wt). Gills showed a narrow range of Cu levels and recorded concentrations from 1.07 ± 0.19 (Epi- nephelus sp., Hurghada) to 2.97 ± 0.28 mg/g wet wt (Synodus sp., Shalateen). Concentrations of Cu in muscles ranged from
0.17 ± 0.02 (Synodus sp., Suez) to 0.77 ± 0.14 mg/g wet wt (T.
mediterraneus, Suez).

Zinc (Zn)

Epinephelus sp. exhibited a tendency to accumulated high concentration of Zn in the liver when compared to other species (64.61 ± 6.46 mg/g wet wt in Shalateen). Sardinella sp.
recorded the highest concentrations of Zn in gills (59.90 ± 2.72 mg/g wet wt in Suez), while the highest concen- trations of Zn in muscles were recorded in G. oyena (12.03 ± 1.72 mg/g wet wt). On the other hand, the herbivore S. gibbus (from Shalateen) recorded the lowest Zn concentra-
tions in all studied organs (1.76 ± 0.33, 7.77 ± 1.18 and
1.17 ± 0.63 mg/g wet wt in the liver, gills and muscles respectively).

Lead (Pb)

Concentrations of Pb in gills ranged from 1.03 ± 0.5 (S. gibbus, Hurghada) to 6.93 ± 1.40 mg/g wet wt (Synodus sp., Shalateen). Liver showed a wide range of Pb levels ranging from 0.14 ± 0.15 (S. gibbus, Shalateen) to 3.08 ± 0.78 mg/g wet wt (Epinephelus sp.,
Shalateen), while the concentrations of Pb in muscles ranged from 0.21 ± 0.09 (S. gibbus, Shalateen) to 0.88 ± 0.12 mg/g wet wt (Epinephelus sp., Shalateen).

Cadmium (Cd)

Liver showed a wide range of Cd concentrations among the studied fish, a very low Cd concentration (0.03 ± 0.02 mg/g wet wt) was recorded in S. gibbus (from Shalateen), and an





102	e gypti an j o ur nal o f b a sic  and a pp l i ed sci en c e s  1 ( 2014) 9 7 e10 5 



extremely high concentration (8.37 ± 0.32 mg Cd/g wet wt) was observed in the liver of Caranx sp. (Shalateen). In gills, Cd levels varied between 0.19 ± 0.06 (S. gibbus, Hurghada) and
1.68 ± 0.38 mg/g wet wt (Sardinella sp., Suez). Cd concentrations
in the muscles ranged from 0.03 ± 0.01 (S. gibbus, Shalateen) to
0.38 ± 0.29 mg/g wet wt (Sardinella sp., Suez).

Iron (Fe)

In liver, Fe concentrations were found to be between
34.75 ± 3.34 and 656.98 ± 60.13 mg/g wet wt (Synodus sp. and Lethrinus sp. from Suez, respectively). The concentrations of Fe in gills ranged from 19.95 ± 3.10 (Epinephelus sp., Hurghada) to
324.40 ± 46.25 mg/g wet wt (Synodus sp., Shalateen). Muscles
recorded Fe concentrations from 1.15 ± 0.23 (N. japonicus, Suez) to 11.53 ± 1.68 mg/g wet wt (Sardinella sp., Hurghada).

Manganese (Mn)

Manganese concentrations in gills showed a wide variation and ranged between 1.01 ± 0.40 (Epinephelus sp., Hurghada) and 33.98 ± 6.25 mg/g wet wt (Sardinella sp., Suez). In liver, concentrations of Mn ranged from 0.17 ± 0.02 (S. gibbus, Sha- lateen) to 2.87 ± 0.28 mg/g wet wt (Sardinella sp., Suez). Fish muscles recorded the lowest concentrations of Mn and ranged between 0.10 ± 0.03 (Lethrinus sp., Suez) and 0.93 ± 0.19 mg/g wet wt (Sardinella sp., Suez).

Discussions

Variations in organs ability to accumulate metals

Fish of the present study always showed the lowest concen- tration of metals in muscle. The essential metals Cu, Zn and Fe were accumulated mainly in the liver, while Pb and Mn exhibited their highest concentrations in gills. The accumu- lation pattern of Cd differed between species where the highest concentrations were fluctuated between the liver and gills.
The accumulation of essential metals in the liver is likely linked to its role in metabolism [4]; high levels of Zn and Cu in hepatic tissues are usually related to a natural binding pro- teins such as metallothioneins (MT) [27] which act as an essential metal store (i.e., Zn and Cu) to fulfill enzymatic and other metabolic demands [28,29]. In the same way, Fe tends to accumulate in hepatic tissues due to the physiological role of the liver in blood cells and hemoglobin synthesis [27]. On the other hand, the liver also showed high levels of non-essential metals such as Cd; this finding could be explained by the ability of Cd to displace the normally MT-associated essential metals in hepatic tissues [29]. Similar results of high Zn, Cu and Cd in the liver were observed in many field studies [4,30e33].
The studied fish tend to accumulate Pb, Mn and to some
extent Cd in gills. Gills are the main route of metal ion ex- change from water [26] as they have very large surface areas that facilitate rapid diffusion of toxic metals [25]. Therefore, it is suggested that metals accumulated in gills are mainly concentrated from water. This is in agreement with the
findings of Moore and Ramamoorthy [24]. They reported the lack of correlation between Pb residues and feeding habits in aquatic organisms. Similar results for high Pb concentrations in gills were recorded by Kargin [34], Avenant-Oldewage and Marx [35], Abu Hilal and Ismail [37] and Qadir and Malik [26]. Also, Eisler [30] reported that fish's hard tissues had consis-
tently higher accumulations of Mn than soft tissues.

Inter-specific variations in metal accumulation

Fish in the present study were collected from different habitat and have various morphometric parameters (Table 1). The present results showed that fish exhibited wide inter-specific variations in metals accumulation in all organs.
Many studies attributed high metal accumulation to the feeding habit of the fish. For instance, Khaled [23] argued that because S. rivulatus is an herbivore, it accumulated higher concentrations of metals in their muscles than the carnivore Sargus sargus; This suggestion was not a reasonable cause for high metal accumulation in the current study since S. gibbus (a herbivore) recorded the lowest concentration of metals in most cases during the study, while the other herbivore (S. rivulatus) showed minor variations (as high concentrations of Cu in liver). Alternatively, Al-Busaidi et al. [6] suggested that, high Cd concentrations in muscles of yellowfine tuna T. albacares was due to their feeding at the higher trophic levels (carnivorous); however metal accumulations in carnivorous fish were not consistently the highest recorded in the present study except Epinephelus sp. which showed a tendency to accumulate metals (Zn, Pb and Cu) in the liver with relatively high concentrations. Apart from previous suggestions, feeding habit may be one reason of metal variation in the filter feeder Sardinella sp. which accumulated relatively high con- centrations of all metals except Pb in muscles and exhibited ability to accumulate Mn with high concentrations in all or- gans. These findings in Sardinella sp. could be linked to feeding on phytoplankton since it is the most likely biota compart- ment for Zn and Cu concentration [22,38]. Petkevich [39] also generalized that bony tissues of plankton-feeding fish concentrated manganese to a greater extent than benthos- feeders [30]. Wide agreement with these results in Sardinella sp. was observed in the previous studies; Abdallah [22] recorded high Zn and Pb concentration in the muscles of sardinella aurita collected from El-Mex Bay; Alturiqi and Albe- dair [40] found relatively high concentrations of Zn, Cd, Fe and Mn in sardine collected from the Saudi market in comparison to Grouper and blackspot emperor. Chen and Chen [41] found that the muscles of Sardinella lemuru recorded the highest concentrations of Zn, Fe, Cu, and Mn among nine fish species collected from the Ann-Ping coastal waters, Taiwan.
It was interesting to note that a large fish of Caranx sp.
(from Shalateen) showed very high concentrations of Cd in liver (8.37 ± 0.32 mg/g wet wt), which was several times of magnitude greater than other studied fish, even from the
same species (Tables 2e4). This finding can be linked to the age of the fish; since Cd is difficult to be excreted from liver once it is accumulated [23]. This large fish (length 87.8 cm, weight 24500 g) likely accumulated high Cd concentrations throughout its long life. This agrees with the suggestions of Eisler [30] that Cd in liver is positively linked to the age of the

103








fish. In this context, Ploetz et al. [42] stated that Cd concen- trations in the liver of king mackerel, Scomberomorus cavalla increased with increasing fork length. Furthermore, Kojadi- novic et al. [43] recorded Cd concentrations in the liver of Swordfish, Xiphias gladius up to 46.9 mg/g wet wt.
It is suggested that benthic fish are likely to have higher heavy metal concentrations than fish inhabiting the upper water column because they are in direct contact with the sediments and their greater uptake of heavy metal con- centrations from zoobenthic predators [44]. However, re- sults from several studies did not support this suggestion or even contradict it; Zhao et al. [4] found that Cynoglossus gracilis had the lowest level of metal accumulation among investigated species despite that it is a typical benthic fish. Also, Bustamante et al. [45] did not find segregation between pelagic and benthic fish in their accumulation of metals in the liver and kidneys. Results of the present study provide weak or no support for this suggestion, where variations between pelagic and benthic organisms were detected only as high concentration of Fe in the gills of the benthic fish Synodus sp. when compared to other species. This finding may be attributed to higher levels of Fe in subsurface water of the Red Sea as recorded in the study of Sheridah et al. [36].
Although fish are mostly migratory and seldom settle in one place, metal accumulation in fish organs provides evi- dences of exposure to contaminated aquatic environment [26] and could be used to assess the health condition of the area from which they were collected. In the present study, spatial distribution of metals showed significant high concentrations of Cu, Zn, Pb, Cd and Mn in Suez. Also, the results from single species showed that, pelagic fish collected from Suez (Epi- nephelus sp., Sardinella sp., Lethrinus sp. and T. mediterraneus) recorded significantly the highest concentration of Cd in muscles, and relatively high Cd concentrations in other or- gans (liver and gills). These results agree with the previous studies that reported high metal levels in the seawater of Suez Bay when compared to those from the Red Sea proper [11,14], which is mainly due to the industrial and anthropogenic input of metals from Suez City and the maritime activities through the Suez Canal.

Health-risk assessment for fish consumption

It is well known that muscles are not an active site for metal biotransformation and accumulation [9]. But in polluted aquatic habitats the concentration of metals in fish muscles may exceed the permissible limits for human consumption and imply severe health threats.
To asses public health risk of the Red Sea fish consump- tion, we compared metal levels in muscles of the current study (Tables 2e4) with the maximum permissible limits for human consumption (MPL) established by many different organizations (Table 6); as well as comparing metal concen- trations in muscles to those reported in similar fish species from the previous studies (Table 7). For the comparison to the data published as dry weight, they were converted to wet weight using converting factor 0.3; since the moisture is usually about 70% in the muscles [22].
With few exceptions, the metal concentrations in the examined fish species from the Red Sea fall below the (MPL)

for human consumption recommended by FAO [46], WHO [47],
r e f e r e n c e s 

MAFF [48] and EC [49], and were generally in the same range or		
below the concentrations in the muscles of the same fish

species from pervious studies conducted in relatively unpol- luted waters.
The essential metals Cu, Zn, Fe and Mn were clearly below all the permissible limits for human consumption. While, the non-essential metal Pb was below the PML recommended by WHO [47] and MAFF [48], and was around or a little bit higher than the levels recommended by FAO [46] and FAO/WHO [50]. Similarly Cd was generally below the PML in most cases except for the pelagic species from Suez that were higher than the levels recommended by FAO [46] and EC [49], but still below FAO/WHO [50], WHO [47] and MAFF [48] recommended limit.
The results in previous literatures were somewhat closer to or higher than our obtained data for similar fish species. For example, Abdallah [22] recorded the concentrations of Cd, Pb, Cu and Zn in muscles of Sardinella aurita, S. rivulatus and Synodus saurus from two main harbors in Alexandria, Egypt, who reported metal levels much higher than those recorded in the same species of the current work. In addition, metal levels in the present study were generally lower or within the ranges of those found in the fish of the Red Sea recorded by Hanna [13], Abdelmoneim and El-Deek [18], Emara et al. [17], Ahmed et al. [20], El-Moselhy [15] and Ali et al. [51].
After all, fish in the Red Sea were found to be safe for consumption and do not pose a significant threat to the health of human consumers.

Conclusions

Metal concentrations in the three studied locations were within the same range or below the concentrations in similar species from previous studies in the Egyptian waters or else- where. The results also showed that metal accumulation varied between organs and species depending on species- specific factors like feeding behavior, swimming patterns and genetic tendency, and/or other factors like age and geographical distribution that caused variation in metals ac- cumulations between fish even from the same species.
Health risk analysis of heavy metals in the edible parts of the fish indicated safe levels for human consumption and concentrations in the muscles are generally accepted by the international legislation limits. However, the levels of metals in pelagic fish and Sardinella sp. should be continuously monitored in potential polluted areas since pelagic fish showed a tendency to accumulate cadmium in muscles from polluted water, and Sardinella sp. accumulated high concen- trations of Cu, Zn, Cd, Fe and Mn in the muscles when compared to other species.
