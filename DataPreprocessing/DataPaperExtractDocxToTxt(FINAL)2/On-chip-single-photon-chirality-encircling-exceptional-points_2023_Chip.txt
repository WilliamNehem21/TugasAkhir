Exceptional points (EPs), typically defined as the degeneracy points of a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, have been investigated in various physical systems such as photonic systems. In particular, the intriguing topological structures around EPs have given rise to novel strategies for manipulating photons and the underlying mechanism is especially useful for on-chip photonic applications. Although some on-chip experiments using lasers have been reported, EP-based photonic chips working in the quantum regime have been largely elusive. Here, we propose a single-photon experiment to dynamically encircle an EP in on-chip photonic waveguides possessing passive anti-parity-time symmetry. Photon coincidences measurement reveals a chiral feature of transporting single photons, which can act as a building block for on-chip quantum devices that require asymmetric transmissions. Our findings pave the way for on-chip experimental study on the physics of EPs as well as inspiring applications for on-chip non-Hermitian quantum devices.


INTRODUCTION

Exceptional points (EPs), first introduced in quantum mechanics by investigating parity-time (PT) symmetric systems, are defined as the coalescence of both the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a non- Hermitian Hamiltonian1-4. Recent studies have revealed their intriguing physics in different physical systems which have enabled various applications5-16. In particular, the complex eigenvalues around an EP form self-intersecting energy surfaces, a hallmark feature of non-Hermitian systems that allows the exchange of eigenstates via a stroboscopic encircling of the EP in a parameter space17,18. Interestingly, if the system evolves dynamically around a closed loop encircling the EP, i.e., changing an eigenstate

in the real-space structure to mimic the looping of the EP in the parameter space, the dynamics is revealed to be chiral19-30. This chiral approach for manipulating waves without introducing chiral structures is unique to non-Hermitian systems, as its realization requires the breakdown of adiabaticity which is a result of non-Hermiticity31-33.
Most of the studies on the dynamical encirclement of EPs rely on the platform of photonic waveguides20-30, since it is quite convenient to design a variation of the structure along the waveguiding direction in order to mimic the EP encirclement process. Meanwhile, photonic waveguides are basic elements on a photonic chip. Therefore, the dynamical EP encirclement process would be quite useful for manipulating photons on photonic chips. Although a few EP-related photonic chips have been reported22-30, the experiments were conducted in the classical regime with lasers being the source. Photonic chips are also powerful platform for exploring quantum phenomenon and associated applications where single photons or multi-photons are used as the information processing carrier. However, the corresponding non-Hermitian experiments remain largely absent.
In this work, we propose an experiment that realizes the dynamical encircling of an EP on a photonic chip towards single-photon manipulations and applications. We design a passive anti-parity- time (anti-PT) symmetric photonic system which supports a second-order EP. The unique topological structure of anti-PT symmetric non-Hermitian systems allows the fact that the eigenmodes that can be used for chiral mode switching lie in the PT-broken phase. As a result, single-photon states employing path-encoding or polarization-encoding can be conveniently used for on-chip asymmetric transmission applications. We perform experiments using both lasers and single-photons through coincidences measurement to verify the EP-encirclement induced chiral photon transmission phenomenon. The proposed system has the potential to become a building block of on-chip asymmetric quantum devices.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

EP encircling in on-chip passive anti-PT-symmetric systems. Fig. 1a depicts a schematic diagram of our experimental system which consists of three elliptical waveguides with the center one being lossy. Similar non-Hermitian architectures have been studied before based on microwave platforms16 and integrated photonic platforms29,30 using classical light. In this work, we employed femtosecond laser direct writing techniques34-36 to fabricate the device in boroaluminosilicate glasses and will show measurement results using both classical light and single photons. Our technique allows the fabrication of three-dimensional waveguide arrays and the proposed idea may inspire the design of three- dimensional on-chip non-Hermitian devices. In our system, the straight waveguide S exhibits a loss of
~40 dB/cm, which is achieved by re-exposing the waveguide at equally-spaced points (see Methods).

This technique can create an array of scatterers that induces significant scattering/transmission losses for photons propagating in waveguide S. The loss of a single scatterer is highly tunable since it strongly depends on the exposure time and laser power (Fig. 1c). In the defined “EP encircling region” (with length L = 14 mm), the two gap distances g1 and g2 are designed to be varying (also see Fig. 1b for top view) such that an EP is dynamically encircled. We refer to the two end facets of waveguide 1 as port 1 and 1' and so forth for waveguide 2.
Electromagnetic waves propagating in the paraxial waveguides system is governed by a

Schrodinger-like equation reads:
iz ψ  z 
 H  z  ψ  z 
 0 , and the 3×3 non-Hermitian Hamiltonian

	0	κ1(z)	0	
H (z)  κ (z)	iγ	κ (z)  , (1)
 1	2	
	(z)	δ	

where κ1 and κ2 are coupling coefficients that can be determined from g1 and g2 (inset of Fig. 2a), γ = 6×10-5k0 denotes the loss of waveguide S with k0 being the vacuum wave number, and δ is a detuning parameter (see Supplementary materials, Sec. I for details on fitting the Hamiltonian). The eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are the change of the waveguide propagation constant introduced to that of an individual lossless waveguide. We label eigenmodes polarized along the y-axis as vertical-polarized modes (V-modes) and study their EPs at wavelength of 810 nm in a g‒α‒δ 3D parameter space, where we have introduced g = (g1+g2)/2 and α = (g1‒g2)/(g1+g2). Fig. 2a plots the positions of all the EPs (of second-order) which form two types of exceptional lines (ELs). The dashed EL is located on the δ = 0

plane and satisfies
κ 2 κ 2  γ 2 /4 . The solid ELs located at κ  κ
	appear in the

1	2	1	2
region δ ≠ 0 and their existence is a consequence of the passive anti-PT symmetry of the system. We leave detailed derivations and discussions on the origin of the ELs as well as the effective Hamiltonian of the system which is passive anti-PT-symmetric (i.e., anti-PT-symmetric but the diagonal term is shifted by a constant) to Supplementary materials, Sec. II, and here we only focus on the EP (see the yellow star) in a g‒α 2D parameter space with a fixed value δ = 9×10-6k0 (see the grey surface).
Fig. 2b and c plot respectively the real part and imaginary part of the eigenvalues EH of the Hamiltonian in the g‒α parameter space. An EP (marked by the star) can be found as the coalescence of the red sheet and the blue sheet. This EP links the symmetric phase and broken phase (marked by white dashed lines), which can be defined by the symmetry of the eigenfunctions. The inset of Fig. 2c shows the eigenfunctions at g = 10 μm and α = 0 (calculated using COMSOL37, also see Fig. S1). The

broken eigenmode symmetry confirms that this point is in the broken phase. Considering that the real/imaginary parts of the eigenvalues bifurcate/coalesce there, we can safely state that our system is passive anti-PT-symmetric.
Now we create a loop to encircle the EP, with the above point in the broken phase as the starting/end point (see the loop in Fig. 2a). The loop formula is given in Methods, following which the sample in Fig. 1a was fabricated. A wave incident through port 1 or 2 and exit through port 1' or 2' follows a counter-clockwise loop, while the wave excited through port 1' or 2' leads to a clockwise- loop process. We solve the Hamiltonian equation (see Fig. S2 for details) with these four ports being excited respectively, and summarize the state evolution trajectories on the energy sheets in Fig. 2d-g. We should emphasize that the process in Fig. 2f is more complicated than the other three, since the initial state will encounter a nearly degenerate region (which is marked by the yellow dashed line in Fig. 2b) which is resulted from the exceptional line on the δ = 0 plane in Fig. 2a. When crossing this region, the power is almost equally redistributed into two eigenstates so that we have plotted the evolution trajectory on both the red and grey sheets there (also see Fig. S2 for a more detailed explanation). Fortunately, these complicated evolution details will not affect the mode conversion results, since we find that the output state for counter-clockwise loops is always the mode localized in waveguide 2 (Fig. 2d and e), whereas clockwise loops result in a final state in waveguide 1 (Fig. 2f and g). This is the phenomenon of chiral mode switching, which has been realized in passive PT- symmetric systems for symmetric/antisymmetric modes, i.e., coupled modes localized in two waveguides21,24. In contrast, our system enables the chiral transmission of on-chip fundamental modes that are bounded in only one waveguide because of the topological structure of passive anti-PT- symmetric energy surfaces. The mechanism underlying the chiral phenomenon is that the eigenstates tend to stay on the lowest-loss energy sheet (i.e., the blue sheet), otherwise non-adiabatic transitions19- 21 (NATs) from higher-loss sheet to lower-loss sheet would occur (see the NAT in Fig. 2e and f).
Experimental results in the classical regime. We show experimental results using classical laser light at 810 nm (MDL-III, CNI). Fig. 3a-d show the output images (measured by XG500, XWJG) of the V- modes with excitations at different ports. When port 1 or port 2 is excited which corresponds to a counter-clockwise loop to encircle the EP, the output power in waveguide 2 is always significantly larger than that in waveguide 1 (Fig. 3a and b). If we consider waveguide 2 only, the output power in Fig. 3a (~2.78 mW) is much higher than that in Fig. 3b (~0.39 mW). This is due to the fact that the process that is adiabatic (i.e., port 1 in, port 2' out, also see Fig. 2d) would exhibit a lower loss than that with a NAT (i.e., port 2 in, port 2' out, also see Fig. 2e). To further demonstrate this point, we depict in Fig. 3e and f the top-view light diffraction patterns in the device for the above two cases

(photographed by Zyla 5.5 sCMOS, Andor). Since light in waveguide S can be strongly diffracted by the array of scatterers and then captured by our camera, we have lowered these “noises” when plotting Fig. 3e and f in order to make the patterns in waveguide 1 and 2 more clear. Fig. 3e shows an adiabatic transfer of light from waveguide 1 to waveguide 2, whereas Fig. 3f depicts a process with a NAT and light also exits the device via port 2' but with a much lower intensity. The clockwise route can be investigated using the same way, as shown in Fig. 3c and d where the output mode is mainly localized in waveguide 1. These measurements clearly demonstrate the chiral mode switching dynamics, and the NAT as indicated by the power difference is another evidence of such dynamics.
The bandwidth of the chiral phenomenon was studied using a tunable laser (range 730 to 860 nm, Tsunami, Spectra-Physics). We measured the S parameters Sm,n of the system, which is defined as the transmission from port n to port m, where m, n = 1, 2, 1', or 2'. Fig. 3g and h plot the ratio of S parameters (see the inset for definitions) for counter-clockwise loops and clockwise loops, respectively. We find that in the grey region (~790 to 820 nm), S2',1 and S2',2 are the predominant S parameters for counter-clockwise loops, while S1,1' and S1,2' dominate the output for clockwise loops. These results indicate the EP-encirclement induced chiral mode switching. All the above measurements were performed for the V-modes, and we also measured the S parameters for horizontal-polarized modes (H-modes that are polarized along the x-axis). The corresponding results are given in Fig. 3i and j, where the chiral mode switching behavior can also be found but in a different wavelength range (~740 to 780 nm). Such difference should be attributed to dispersion of the eigenmodes as well as the birefringence of the fabricated waveguides. Full results of the S parameters are given in Fig. S4 and S5.
Experimental results in the single-photon regime. We performed experiments in the single-photon regime to show that the above chiral transmission phenomenon also applies to single photons. In the quantum regime, the eigenstates supported in the system are richer than those in the classical system. More specifically, at the starting/end point of the encircling loop, the waveguides system supports

classical-like states including
110S02   ,
011S02
and
011S02
, where the subscript and the number

indicate respectively the waveguide and the photon number within. Moreover, the quantum system also	supports	superposition	states	that	have	no	classical	counterparts	such	as

 110S02

 /
where 𝜑 depicts a phase. These quantum states are often used on

photonic chips for various applications. Therefore, we need to verify whether these single-photon states can be employed for the chiral transmission by dynamically encircling the EP.
The experimental setup is depicted in Fig. 4a, where pairs of indistinguishable photons at 810 nm

were generated by a BBO crystal. One photon was launched into one port of the fabricated sample and the other photon was propagating in an optical fibre. We used two avalanche photodetectors at the output side of the system to measure their photon coincidences (see Methods), which can demonstrate the evolution dynamics of single photons in the device.

We first test the dynamics of the states
110S02
and
010S12
, and single photons can enter and

exit the sample via port 1, 2, 1', or 2'. The measured photon coincidences at different output ports as a function of the input port are summarized in Fig. 4b and c for the V-modes. Fig. 4b shows that for counter-clockwise loops, the photon coincidence measured at port 2' is considerably larger than that at port 1', no matter via which port the single photon was launched. The situation is just opposite for clockwise loops in Fig. 4c, where port 1 always shows the largest photon coincidence. In addition, for either counter-clockwise loops or clockwise loops, the photon coincidence of the adiabatic case (i.e., input from port 1 or port 2') is also higher than that of the case with NATs (i.e., input from port 2 or port 1').
We then test the superposition states by adding a 1:1 directional coupler (with port A and B) before

the sample chip, and superposition states  110S02
 eiφ

010S12
 /
can be generated at the input

side of the sample. Here φ denotes a phase difference which is equal to π/2 by choosing a proper length of the directional coupler in our experiment, but its value does not affect the measurement results since the device exhibits a chiral transmission feature. The measured photon coincidences are given in Fig. 4d and e for counter-clockwise loops and clockwise loops, respectively, where the chiral phenomenon is also observed. Therefore, by the dynamical encirclement of a second-order EP in the proposed passive anti-PT-symmetric system, we have realized the on-chip chiral transport of single photons, as single photons will most probably exit the device via waveguide 2 for left-to-right transmissions while via waveguide 1 for right-to-left transmissions. This chiral strategy would be useful for on-chip quantum applications that involve the path-encoding or polarization-encoding of single photons38,39. For comparison, we also test the dynamics of the H-modes and show the corresponding results in Fig. 4f-i, where the chiral dynamics does not occur at 810 nm.
Conclusion. To conclude, we have investigated a passive anti-PT-symmetric system in the single- photon regime and revealed the topological structure around a second-order EP of the system. By dynamically encircling the EP in a designed parameter space, we have realized the on-chip chiral transport of single photons, which has the potential to act as the building block of on-chip quantum devices that require an asymmetric transmission feature. The re-exposure technique in our experimental setup allows us to introduce highly tunable loss to the waveguide, making the

experimental platform quite useful for the exploration of non-Hermitian quantum physics. The femtosecond laser direct writing technique can be employed to fabricate three-dimensional on-chip devices34-36, therefore three-dimensional non-Hermitian single-photon manipulation schemes are expected to be developed in the future. Meanwhile, the functionality of the fabricated devices (e.g., directional coupler) is reconfigurable by using a secondary direct writing technique40. A current trend for quantum photonic integrated circuits is to combine multiple materials and platforms in order to fully make use of their respective advantages41. In this sense, in addition to its advantage of three- dimensional integration and reconfiguration, the proposed platform is expected to be co-integrated with other quantum-photonic technologies to make up its limitation in terms of integrated quantum sources and detectors. Nitrogen-vacancy color centers in diamonds, which can also be prepared by using femtosecond laser direct writing techniques42, are good candidates for on-chip single photon sources. Integrating semiconductor single-photon avalanche photodiodes43 with the proposed photonic chip via heterogeneous approach is a promising solution to the detecting problem. We expect the proposed platform to play a key role in the next generation high-performance wafer-scale quantum photonic integrated circuits.

METHODS
Sample fabrication. The waveguides were fabricated inside boroaluminosilicate glasses (Corning EAGLE 2000, n = 1.504) and the refractive index contrast between the waveguide and the background is ~0.0025. To fabricate the sample, we focused a Ti:sapphire laser (Light Conversion Carbide 5W, repetition rate of 1 MHz, pulse energy of 200 nJ and pulse duration of 290 fs) 170 μm below the glass surface using a ×40 microscope (NA = 0.75). An Aerotech system was used to control the motion of the glass in order to write the waveguides. The waveguide exhibits a size of ~6.85 μm × 5.23 μm under a writing speed of 40 mm/s. The transmission loss in waveguides 1 and 2 is ~0.3dB/cm, which is significantly lower than that in waveguide S.
Re-exposure technique to introduce losses. The loss in waveguide S was introduced using a re- exposure technique. To be specific, we first fabricated a normal waveguide S and then equally-spaced points in waveguide S were re-exposed to introduce scatterers. The exposure time is 10 ms with the laser power of 140 mW and the distance between adjacent points is ~10 μm. Under these conditions, the scattering loss induced by each scatterer was measured to be ~0.04dB, corresponding to a transmission loss in waveguide S of 40 dB/cm.
Quantum measurement. As depicted in Fig. 4a, a continuous-wave pump laser at 405 nm is used as the source. We used a half wave plate (HWP) and a polarization beam splitter (PBS) to manipulate the

polarization and intensity of the beam. After going through a Beta Barium Borate (BBO) crystal, indistinguishable pairs of photons at 810 nm were generated. We then used an HWP and a quarter wave plate (QWP) to control the polarization of each single photon. One single photon was injected into a single-mode fiber (SMF) and finally collected by an avalanche photodetector (APD). The other single photon was injected into the sample (the input port can be port 1, port 2, port 1', or port 2') and another APD was used at the corresponding output port to collect the single photon. Finally, we performed coincidence measurement based on the data collected by the two APDs. In the measurement of Fig. 4d,e,h,i, we have added a directional coupled (DC) before the device in order to generate the superposition states. The DC with a splitting ratio of 1:1 consists of double waveguides on a chip, while our device was fabricated on another chip. We have aligned the two chips but there are still coupling losses. As a result, the measured photon coincidences in Fig. 4d,e,h,i are much lower than those in Fig. 4b,c,f,g.

Formula  of  the  encircling  loop. The  loop in  the  g-α  parameter  space  takes  the  form:

g1(z)  cos2π z / L  π / 4
6	and



g2 (z)  sin2π z / L  π / 4
6 , where the unit is in μm. Then

by defining g = (g1+g2)/2 and α = (g1‒g2)/(g1+g2), we can study the system in the g-α parameter space.

Fig. 2 | a, Calculated positions of EPs which form three ELs (orange solid and dashed lines) in the g‒α‒δ 3D parameter space. The grey plane depicts the g-α 2D parameter space used in experiment where a closed loop (black line) is generated to encircle the EP (yellow star). The inset plots the fitting value of κ1 (κ2) as a function of g1 (g2); b,c, Real part (b) and Imaginary part (c) of the eigenvalues of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian in the g-α parameter space. The symmetric phase and broken phase are marked by the white dashed lines. The starting/end point of the loop lying on the broken phase is marked by the circle with the corresponding eigenfield distributions given in the inset; d-g, Trajectories of the state evolution on the real part of the energy surface with port 1 (d), port 2 (e), port 1' (f), and port 2' (g) as the excitation port. All the simulations were performed for the V-modes at 810 nm.
