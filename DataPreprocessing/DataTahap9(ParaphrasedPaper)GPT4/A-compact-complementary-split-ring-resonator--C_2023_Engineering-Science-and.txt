Furthermore, the design of electromagnetic (EM) energy collectors is crucial in harvesting and conveying energy to wireless sensor nodes. Alternative structural designs such as metamaterial absorbers, antenna arrays, and rectennas have also been suggested. Metamaterials are engineered to have unique electromagnetic properties based on their physical structure, rather than relying on their chemical composition for these characteristics.

The proposed structure's total size, as well as the copper coating on the reverse side, are each 15 mm by 15 mm. This blueprint features a configuration of five split ring resonators (SRRs) that are set at a 45-degree angle relative to each other, aiming to boost the device's efficiency. The strategic 45-degree positioning of the SRRs improves the coupling mechanisms between adjacent resonators, allowing for a more effective interplay between the resonators' electric and magnetic fields. This setup could lead to a stronger network of connections between neighboring SRRs, resulting in enhanced resonance and more dynamic electromagnetic responses. These resonators are made from annealed copper, which is 0.035 mm in thickness and known for its electrical conductivity.
