The research paper emphasizes the importance of earthquake detection for studying Earth's tectonic movements. It examines automated techniques for identifying seismic phases, with a focus on advanced conventional algorithms like template matching, which compares new seismic waveforms with previously recorded ones, and the STA/LTA method, which detects earthquakes based on a ratio of signal amplitudes in short and long time windows. Both methods have limitations, notably with template matching’s dependence on existing data and STA/LTA's potential ineffectiveness with low-signal-to-noise ratios and smaller magnitude events.

The paper is structured into five sections: Section 2 outlines the proposed methodology to improve earthquake monitoring; Section 3 introduces the dataset, experimental setup, and performance evaluation metrics; Section 4 presents the results; and Section 5 summarizes the conclusions.

The methodology involves analyzing a three-channel seismogram—three normalized waveforms over a four-second window—to predict probabilities for P-wave, S-wave, and noise classifications. Various ResNet architecture configurations, such as 1D-ResNet18, 1D-ResNet34, and 1D-ResNet50, were tested for optimal seismic phase identification. The 1D-ResNet34 outperformed the others, showing 98.70% accuracy despite having fewer parameters than 1D-ResNet50.

Comparisons were made between the proposed 1D-ResNet method and previously developed models like CapsNet and CapsPhase. The 1D-ResNet achieved higher testing accuracy, especially in S-phase identification, without requiring model retraining or threshold settings. The effectiveness of 1D-ResNet in noisy conditions was also evaluated by adding Gaussian noise to the dataset. This demonstrated the model's robustness at various noise levels.

The paper concludes that 1D-ResNet is a promising tool for earthquake signal and phase identification, particularly in harsh, low-magnitude conditions. Future work aims to develop a hierarchical classifier for comprehensive earthquake detection and seismic phase identification tasks. Additionally, the research plans to explore how to leverage the pretrained classifier for enhancing the picking of phase arrival times in continuous seismic waveforms.
