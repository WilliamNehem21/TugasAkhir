The academic paper discusses the need for ensuring that high-level formal analysis of software code is reliably reflected at the machine code level for critical systems. This alignment is necessary because, while software is usually described in high-level languages, its actual run-time behavior depends on the compiled machine code. To ensure the analyses remain valid post-compilation, the correctness of the compilation process must be established.

The paper further compares two approaches: compiler certification and compilers that certify their results. It suggests that having compilers that certify their results is beneficial because it eliminates the need to trust or validate the compiler's implementation. Instead, users can verify compiler-produced proofs of correctness, separating implementation details from the certification process. However, a downside of this is that users must check these certifications for every compilation, which can be problematic if the compiler contains bugs.

The authors describe the implementation details of a certifying code generation phase that converts an intermediate language into MIPS assembly code and produces verification artifacts for the Isabelle theorem prover. They outline the structure and optimization strategies used to reduce verification time. By categorizing parts of the proofs according to their reuse across programs and instructions, they manage to streamline the verification process.

The paper also details performance improvements implemented in the certifying code generator, with a focus on minimizing the time required to generate and validate proofs, an important factor for the practical adoption of the approach. They report near linear time for code generation and outline the techniques used to accelerate proof verification within Isabelle.

Evaluation of the implementation highlights the effects on verification time as program complexity increases, with a particular program's verification time nearly doubling as variables are doubled. The paper reflects on the importance of an injectivity proof to avoid resource limitations during verification for larger programs.

Finally, the authors provide statistics on the lines of code for the code generator and proof generator, emphasizing that neither is part of the trusted computing base, suggesting that more complex code generators could be developed without substantially increasing the size of the proof generator. They conclude that certifying code generation is feasible for realistic compilers and suggest that performance improvements in Isabelle's data types could further reduce the complexity and time required to conduct correctness proofs.
