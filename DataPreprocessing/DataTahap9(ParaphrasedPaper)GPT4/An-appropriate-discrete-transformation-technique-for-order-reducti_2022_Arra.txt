This academic paper summarizes the validation of results from comparing higher-order and reduced-order systems through step responses, with errors reported in Section 6. Section 7 addresses the limitations found during the study, while Section 8 concludes with key differences between two methodologies and suggestions for future research.

The paper explores the increased emphasis on discrete-time systems over analog systems due to advancements in digital technology. Higher-order systems are complex to analyze as-is, necessitating order reduction for simplicity and manageability. Numerous order reduction techniques such as Pade approximation, balanced truncation, direct truncation, and aggregation, which were developed for the continuous-time domain, have been adapted for discrete-time systems. However, methods like Routh approximation, widely used in continuous-time domains, are not directly applicable to discrete-time domains. The paper references a list of algorithms based on Routh approximation suitable for continuous-time systems. It then underlines the need for an effective discretization method that not only allows the transformation of discrete-time systems into continuous-time for order reduction application but also facilitates easy inverse transformation, resulting in a simplified but accurate discrete-time reduced-order model.
