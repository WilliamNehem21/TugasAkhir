The study focuses on the importance of phoneme awareness and letter-sound knowledge as pivotal early literacy skills that lead to later reading and spelling abilities. The work highlights the connection between reading difficulties and future academic and occupational outcomes, underpinning the value of early literacy interventions. The research aims to augment these skills in pre-readers, specifically for the Danish language, which has its phonetic challenges due to irregular orthography.

Attention is also recognized as a key factor in learning outcomes, and the study references existing research linking attentional control with reading capabilities. The hypothesis is that embodied learning can improve attention and reading acquisition, previously indicated by improvements seen with motor skills training.

The study explores the use of virtual reality (VR) in combination with embodied learning to bolster phoneme awareness and letter-sound knowledge. It sets up an intervention with three different groups: one using VR and whole-body movements, another using mirror reflections and movements, and a control group receiving no special instruction. The intervention is tested in three Copenhagen primary schools with first-grade students, conforming to stringent ethical considerations and data protection regulations.

The intervention includes embodied learning techniques, such as associating letter sounds with movements. The study employs rigorous testing and sampling methods to minimize bias and maximize the representation of varied classroom settings.

Children's learning outcomes will be measured and compared across the three groups pre- and post-intervention. The researchers are interested in seeing if VR can focus children's attention by creating an immersive, distraction-free environment, hypothesizing that this could lead to greater learning outcomes as compared to non-VR methods.

The potential long-term benefits and the feasibility of VR in classroom settings are also discussed. However, the study acknowledges that teachers must receive adequate training to fully leverage VR's benefits in educational settings.

In summary, the paper investigates the efficacy of using VR combined with whole-body movements to advance early literacy skills in children, with attention to developing pedagogically sound methods that could significantly impact the future of education.
