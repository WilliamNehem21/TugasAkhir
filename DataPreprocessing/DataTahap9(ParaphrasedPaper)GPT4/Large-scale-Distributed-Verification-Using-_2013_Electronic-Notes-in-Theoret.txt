The process of verifying Labelled Transition Systems (LTS) can be hampered if the LTS is too large to be handled by a single computer. To address this challenge, it's possible to employ distributed computing resources, such as clusters and grids, which provide substantially more memory capacity. The CADP (Construction and Analysis of Distributed Processes) verification toolbox takes advantage of these resources by offering tools designed for distributed verification, including the DISTRIBUTOR and BCG_MERGE tools. These enable the construction of a partitioned LTS, where the system is divided into separate parts each stored independently, and the subsequent merging into a single LTS, if needed. However, working with a partitioned LTS for as long as possible can further enhance the verification process.

CADP provides the BCG (Binary Coded Graphs) file format for efficient representation of LTSs, using binary encoding and compression to store states, labels, and transitions. While CADP includes various tools for managing BCG files, such as inspection and visualization, for distributed verification across multiple machines, the PBG (Partitioned BCG Graph) format is used. Developed through the SENVA cooperation between the former SEN2 team at CWI and the VASY team at INRIA Grenoble, this format allows for an LTS to be distributed and jointly processed by several remote machines. Each machine handles a fragment of the LTS, with the PBG file encompassing all fragments which together represent the complete LTS.

To assist users, the PBG_INFO tool has been introduced, offering features like consistency checks, LTS size calculation, label listing, and remote log file concatenation. Additionally, the PBG_OPEN tool, which is compatible with the OPEN/CAESAR standard, enables on-the-fly exploration of large LTSs by utilizing the memory of multiple machines to store transitions.

An essential step in the process is the normalizing of transition labels, where a master assigns unique identifiers to labels reported by each worker node, ensuring consistency across all fragments.

The paper highlights how the newest addition to the CADP toolkit extends its distributed verification capabilities for handling PBG files. Extensive experiments with the tools were conducted on a large-scale grid comprising several clusters in different geographic locations, showcasing the system's performance and scalability limits when employing hundreds of workers.
