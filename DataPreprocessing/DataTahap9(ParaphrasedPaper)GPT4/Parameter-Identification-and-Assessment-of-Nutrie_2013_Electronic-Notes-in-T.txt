The structure of the paper can be rephrased as follows:

This document is laid out as follows: Section 2 revisits the CWC framework. Section 3 lays out the goal programming approach. Section 4 details the model for nutrient movement in AM symbiosis. Section 5 presents the findings from the analysis, highlighting the methodology used. Section 6 offers a brief review of literature on the subject, and Section 7 wraps up the discussion.

Rephrasing the additional information provided:

Plant carbon is released as sucrose into the space surrounding the arbuscule, then split into simpler sugars like hexoses, which the AM fungi take in. While the exact transporters for this sugar have not been identified, there's speculation that they could be similar to proton co-transporters such as GpMST1 from the Geosiphon pyriformis fungus.

The notation occ(H+) indicates the occurrence number of hydrogen ions in the plant or fungal compartment. The model simplifies this concept by accounting for only hydrogen ions to circumvent the complex modeling of water molecule dissociation. The kinetic reactions that describe the modeled processes are encapsulated within CWC rules (1-19) with 'f', 't', and 'p' denoting the respective biological compartments: fungus, periarbuscular space, and plant roots.

The acidity within the periarbuscular space is regulated by the activity of plant and fungal H+ATPases among other mechanisms. These serve as the driving force for proton-dependent transport activities. To accurately model chemical reactions across varying pH levels, an effective representation of H+ concentration is essential, which is achieved by reactions (18) and (19). These particular reactions are distinct in that they employ a function to gauge the rate, specifically working to raise the ion concentration in the periarbuscular space when it is below a certain threshold.

This model was evaluated in comparison to a known ammonium transporter, LjAMT1;1 from Lotus japonicus, which acquires NH4+ ions from the periarbuscular space. Following transport across the plant membrane, the ion is released in its uncharged form, NH3, into the plant cytoplasm. The biological model used is akin to the one covered in Section 4, with the exception that reaction (16) has been modified accordingly.
