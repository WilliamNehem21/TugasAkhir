The paper discusses a system that executes financial transactions, such as deposits and withdrawals. Upon receiving a deposit request, it reads the client's ID and the amount of the deposit, updates the account information, informs the client of their new balance, and resets to await the next instruction. A withdrawal request is handled in a similar manner.

Additionally, the paper outlines a type system designed to attribute effects to processes based on certain type assumptions. These effects act as an indicator of the process's outstanding commitments. When an "begin l" assertion is made, it reduces these commitments by removing the label 'l' from the process's current effect. Conversely, an "end l" assertion increases the current effect with the label 'l'. The effects help to establish the minimum number of "begin" assertions that should be accounted for in the process. A process having an empty effect indicates it has fulfilled all its obligations.
