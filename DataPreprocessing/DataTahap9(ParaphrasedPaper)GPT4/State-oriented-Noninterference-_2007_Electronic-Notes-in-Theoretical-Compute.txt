The academic paper discusses a secure process that, as it stands, is not typable under the current type system due to the strictness of the rule(sum). The specific process in question is "ah. bl+ bl," which cannot be typed as the rules do not allow it. The paper suggests that in order to make this process typable, a modification to rule(sum) could be considered.

The paper further illustrates an issue with the security of the translated process known as [[c]]. This process has a potential security weakness because a same value “v0” could be read from a variable "x" in two sequential assignments, potentially leading to an incorrect final value for "x." The semantics of the translated program could lead to a final value of "v0 + 1," which diverges from the expected "v0 + 2," hence not preserving the intended security property.

The discussion then brings up the surprising finding that full abstraction—a correspondence between source program behavior and its translation—has been achieved for a time-sensitive security notion, which strongly adheres to weak bisimulation. This full abstraction relied on the use of special tick actions in translation ensuring step-by-step correspondence during program execution. Without these tick actions, maintaining time-sensitive security becomes challenging.

The paper goes on to discuss a specific example, [[c]], which is not typable within the security type system introduced in Section 2 of the paper. The issue arises from an inability to assign coherent security levels to certain channels: lock, unlock, and d, due to conflicting security requirements from different parts of the program. 

As a solution to such typing conflicts, the paper proposes to relax the type system, especially for channels that do not transmit values (data flow irrelevant) and are guaranteed to occur, such as lock, unlock, d (and their aliases like done). The authors reference previous research suggesting that actions on these channels inform nothing of value and thus can be treated differently in the type system. Specifically, the rule(sum) could be modified to be less restrictive for these kinds of channels while keeping their security level high. This approach, however, would not be remedied simply by switching rule(sum) to the proposed rule(sum-lax) seen on page 8 of the paper.
