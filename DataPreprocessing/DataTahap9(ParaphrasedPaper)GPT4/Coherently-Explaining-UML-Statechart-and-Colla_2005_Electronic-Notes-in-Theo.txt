The Unified Modeling Language (UML) has established itself as a broadly recognized standard for modeling, specifying, visualizing, and documenting object-oriented software systems in both academic and industrial settings. UML is essentially a visual language comprised of various diagram types, each serving different modeling purposes, and its structure is described by the UML metamodel. However, the more precise meaning of UML's visual elements is often described in natural language, leading to ambiguity. To mitigate this, there is a need for a formal underpinning of UML, which can be partially addressed by the Object Constraint Language (OCL)â€”a textual language used to define constraints that are not visually representable in UML diagrams.

This academic paper introduces a method that turns UML models into graph transformation systems, enabling the validation of software models through simulated runs that can be compared against expected outcomes. This approach focuses on translating UML statechart and collaboration diagrams into graph transformation rules, incorporating OCL constraints directly into the rule-based system.

Previous efforts have attempted to define precise semantics for sections of UML using graph transformations, but this paper presents an integrated method that remains consistent with UML standards, unlike other approaches that may require manual interventions from modelers.

The paper is structured as follows: it begins with an example UML model that includes class, collaboration, and statechart diagrams, and then provides a general overview of system states. It outlines the theoretical foundation behind modeling UML with graph transformations, particularly emphasizing message sending. The paper concludes with thoughts on the model presented and future directions for research.

The example UML model discussed includes classes like `ICQServer`, `ICQClient`, and `ICQSession` to demonstrate relationships such as servers with multiple clients and clients engaging in chats through sessions.

The collaboration diagram specifies operations like `connect`, `establish`, and `receive`, outlining interactions between objects. The model imposes restrictions on operations based on object states specified in statechart diagrams, using guards to indicate allowable transitions.

The system state, representing a model's run-time state, is dynamically changing, consisting of objects, classes, and operations translated into nodes in a graph. Processes, depicted as nodes, evolve, as messages are sent, invoking operations and implementing rules for graph transformations.

The paper delves into the technicalities of implementing these rules, including handling arguments and conditions for operation executions influenced by statechart diagrams. The statechart controls sequence constraints for executing operations on class instances, requiring modification of these rules.

The translation from UML to a graph transformation system aims to offer precise semantics for UML. This work focuses on developing rules that mimic message sending in collaboration diagrams and includes an initial example model to ground the discussion.

Looking ahead, the development of a user-friendly graphical interface for the associated tool is planned, with case studies to evaluate the effectiveness of the approach. Expansion to cover additional UML elements not yet included, such as activity diagrams, is also being considered. Moreover, further research will explore verifying UML model properties using the resultant graph transformation system.
