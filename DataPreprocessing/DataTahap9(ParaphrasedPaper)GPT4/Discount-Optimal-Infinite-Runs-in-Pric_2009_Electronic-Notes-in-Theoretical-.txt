Considerable progress has been made in the last decade in adapting and repurposing the technology of timed automata, particularly in addressing scheduling problems that often hinge on reachability analysis. To tackle the challenge of achieving cost-effective scheduling, a variant known as priced timed automata has been developed, which assigns costs to both the states and transitions within the timed automaton to reflect varying rates of cost accumulation throughout its operation.

In our research, we explore a different concept of optimality for never-ending behaviors by employing a discounting principle. This principle, which is well-established in economics, reduces the impact of future actions on the total cost based on when they occur. We've adapted this economic concept to the realm of timed automata.

Our method for finding the most cost-effective ongoing paths in priced timed automata involves simplifying the problem to finding similar paths in finite weighted graphs. This simplification is a subset of the broader discounted payoff games topic. We detail the foundational research we depend on, while the specifics of our approach are covered in the fifth section of our study.

Despite these contributions, there remain several unresolved challenges. For example, our proof of computability is grounded in regional and corner-point concepts, which are not inherently suited for practical, efficient software solutions. However, other research demonstrates that discount-optimal infinite paths can be defined by certain fixed points. Building on this and the priced zones concept could potentially enable more practical, zone-based computational methods for determining discount-optimal infinite paths.
