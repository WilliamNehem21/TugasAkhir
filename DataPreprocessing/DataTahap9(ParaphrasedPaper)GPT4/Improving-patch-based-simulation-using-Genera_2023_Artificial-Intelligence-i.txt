The paper discusses a geostatistical simulation technique called Multiple-Point Simulation (MPS) that is used to model complex geological formations and the variability in the subsurface, and focuses on a subset of MPS known as patch-based simulation. This paper presents Generative Patched Simulation (GPSIM), a new approach that utilizes Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to improve patch-based simulation methods, which face challenges with data conditioning and verbatim copying due to the limitations of the size of the training image and corresponding pattern database.

Patch-based simulation struggles with conditioning to individual data points, as it often cannot find enough examples in the training image that match the known data exactly, which can be problematic when these data points are numerous and closely spaced. Verbatim copying is another challenge where exact copies of the training image are reproduced in the simulation, leading to less variability and a failure to accurately model spatial uncertainty, which is a key objective in geostatistics.

To overcome these problems, the authors propose using GANs, which consist of two neural networks, the generator and the discriminator, that work against each other to create new realistic patches. This theoretically allows for an unlimited number of new patches to be generated, which should in turn increase diversity among simulations and address the issues of scarce patch availability and verbatim copying. The authors highlight the differences between their work and previous studies like that of Rezaee et al. (2015), which sought to enrich the pattern database by creating multiple simulations from the original training image; while both studies aim to enhance patch-based methods, GPSIM is distinct due to its use of GANs.

The authors assess their method by comparing the enriched patch database against the original database, evaluating two key aspects: the variability between realizations (diversity score) and the consistency within the simulations themselves (inconsistency score). These metrics are used to measure how well the spatial uncertainty is represented and how accurately the statistics of the training image are reproduced in the simulations. Although both original and new patches come from the same underlying probability distribution, the proposed approach aims to improve upon existing methods by utilizing the pattern generation capabilities of GANs, as indicated by similar performance metrics.
