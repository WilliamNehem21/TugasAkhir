The paper discusses the field of projective geometry, which is a branch of mathematics focusing on the properties and relationships of points, lines, and planes, with regard to their incidences. This study is usually encapsulated in textbooks through various subjects including the establishment of axioms for points and lines, the incidence relation, the principle of duality, Desargues' and Fano's theorems, harmonic conjugates, transformations known as projectivities, polarities, and the study of conics.

Projective geometry is praised for its elegance and self-sufficiency, founded on two fundamental entities: points and lines, and the incidence relation between them. The structure is determined by a minimal set of axioms, making the discipline ideally suited for computational formalization and posing an interesting subject for exploration of computer-based mathematical formalization challenges.

Despite being conceptually simple, projective geometry is widely acknowledged as a foundational framework for various other geometrical disciplines, allowing any development within projective geometry to be applicable to affine and, subsequently, Euclidean geometry. This interconnectedness is highlighted in Felix Klein's Erlangen program, which characterizes projective geometry by its property invariance under projective transformations.

One aspect of the paper is its technical discussion on how projective geometry is modelled using the Agda programming language, which supports advanced features like universe polymorphism, implicit arguments, instance arguments, and overloading, all beneficial for the purpose. The authors detail their approach to implementing setoids (sets with an equivalence relation) and managing overloading with instance arguments in Agda.

A key achievement of the paper is the formal, machine-verified proof of the uniqueness of the harmonic conjugate, a proof not thoroughly presented before in the literature. The authors deliberately chose to utilize language features of Agda over its proof-assistant capabilities, leveraging dependent record types and modules to manage abstractions and overloading.

The paper also notes limited reliance on induction, recursion, and pattern matching in their implementation, which is unusual for type theory formalizations, but appropriate given the reliance on abstract data types (ADTs) over inductively defined types.

The authors acknowledge previous efforts in the formalization of projective geometry, such as an early Alf implementation and a more advanced Coq formalization of von Plato's constructive geometry. They also point out the use of similar representation techniques for line/point existence and the apartness relation as in their own work.

Looking forward, the paper situates this work within a larger project aimed at the complete formalization of constructive projective geometry with future themes including projectivities and conics, and examines related issues such as the connection between projective and affine geometries, the implementation of coordinates in the projective plane, and the relationships with algebraic models such as Grassmann-Cayley algebra and geometric algebra.
