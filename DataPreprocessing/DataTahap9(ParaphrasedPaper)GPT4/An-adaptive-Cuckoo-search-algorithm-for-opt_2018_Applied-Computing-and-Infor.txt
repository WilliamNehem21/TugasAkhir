Several researchers have created optimization algorithms inspired by natural phenomena, referred to as nature-inspired algorithms. One such algorithm mimics bat echolocation to calculate distances, while Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) stems from observing schooling patterns in fish and birds. Differential Evolution (DE) is designed around principles of evolution, including mutation, crossover, and selection, similar to that proposed by Storn and Price. Algorithms based on ants and bees draw from how these insects use pheromones to communicate and locate resources, with pheromone levels indicating promising solutions.

The Cuckoo Search (CS) algorithm takes inspiration from the breeding strategy of cuckoo birds, aiming to spread their offspring across multiple nests. The CS algorithm has been found to be more efficient than other nature-inspired algorithms, including DE, PSO, and Simulated Annealing (SA), with CS also considered a generalized form of these algorithms. The superiority of CS was noted in its faster convergence rate and computational efficiency when compared to DE and PSO.

This paper's objective is to explore and evaluate the performance of CS algorithms with a switching parameter that dictates the balance between local and global search. As iterations increase, this parameter changes from linear to exponential to power increments. The parasitic cuckoo birds' precise egg-laying behavior and strategies to increase their eggs' survival rates inspire the solution representation in the CS algorithm. A nest represents a potential solution, and each cuckoo can only lay one egg, equating to one solution.

Contrasting with the original CS where the switching parameter is fixed at 0.25, this study investigates the impact of a dynamically varying parameter on algorithm efficiency. Limited studies have previously explored this dynamic alteration. For this research, each CS variant was tested on ten functions, repeating the process twenty times, and the results were analyzed for mean and standard deviation using Microsoft Excel.

The paper examines the potential for increasing CS algorithm efficiency by integrating various probability distribution functions (Cauchy, Gauss, and Gamma) for random walk step sizes. The key contribution lies in the novel approach of using dynamic switching parameters to enhance CS algorithm performance. Of the three types of switching parameters tested—linear, exponential, and power—the Cuckoo Search with an Exponential Increasing (CSEI) switching parameter demonstrated greater efficiency compared to the rest.
