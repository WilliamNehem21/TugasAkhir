Interoperability in IoT devices can be achieved through the use of the MQTT protocol, which utilizes a central broker for data exchange between devices. Despite its advantages, MQTT has become a target for cyber attackers, including those who conduct low-rate DDoS (LR-DDoS) attacks. LR-DDoS attacks can disrupt service by congesting traffic, overloading devices, and depleting resources, posing a severe threat to IoT networks, especially since these devices often lack the capacity to run complex security mechanisms due to resource limitations.

To counter LR-DDoS attacks in IoT systems, various detection and mitigation strategies have been explored, with differing levels of effectiveness, often constrained by IoT device capabilities. There's a demand for efficient solutions compatible with the limited resources of IoT devices that can be deployed in software-defined IoT settings.

The paper is structured to cover a literature review, a presentation of the proposed detection and mitigation mechanism, methodology, experiment details, results analysis, and a comparison of current approaches. It wraps up with a conclusion and future research directions.

Machine learning (ML) techniques for detecting and mitigating DDoS attacks have attracted attention due to the expanding IoT device ecosystem. The literature is categorized into three segments: LR-DDoS attacks in IoT, DDoS attacks via MQTT in IoT, and DDoS in software-defined IoT environments.

Researchers have presented various methodologies, like the combination of Hidden Markov Models and Random Forest for identification in cloud data centers, realistic datasets for smart home scenarios to aid ML detection and classification, an ML-based intrusion detection system (IDS) with high precision, and an entropy-based technique utilizing SDN to lighten the controller's load.

The paper also highlights an intelligent system that employs supervised learning models to distinguish LR-DDoS traffic from legitimate traffic, using a new dataset created from real-time SD-IoT communication. The system aims for the highest accuracy with the minimum necessary input features to be as lightweight as possible.

Lastly, the paper suggests future research directions, including the exploration of other cyberattacks on MQTT-based IoT systems, generating datasets for various IoT protocols and attacks, developing mitigation strategies to complement the detection system, and examining 5G-related attacks and persistent threats using advanced learning techniques.
