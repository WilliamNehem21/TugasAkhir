This academic paper discusses the limitations of purely functional approaches in software analysis tasks and proposes the generalization from functions to relations. The relational approach is shown to be more flexible, notably in the handling of non-deterministic specifications and the modeling of concurrent or reactive systems, as well as the semantics of various logical formalisms.

The paper introduces a novel approach that employs visual representations—known as diagrams—for relational reasoning. These diagrams not only visualize algebraic axioms but also enable intuitive and powerful rules for transforming and decomposing them, thus preserving relevant properties. This diagrammatic reasoning is applied in a similar way to informal rewriting theory practices and is extended to relational software development methods such as B or Z.

Diagrams are celebrated for conveying the essence of proofs within rewriting theory by focusing on the important aspects and omitting tedious details. They provide a balance between informal rigor and the traditional formal rigor found in logic or algebra. The approach unifies these aspects into a simple and convenient formalism which assists in sketching proofs that can be incrementally refined. The algebraic semantics these diagrams are based on could also potentially facilitate automated verification.

The paper's authors detail the primary notions related to their diagrammatic calculus and aim to integrate it into a formal method in the future. They suggest that this diagram technique could be incorporated into a graphical user interface, allowing for direct manipulation and user-defined transformations, bridging algebraic and diagrammatic reasoning. The paper is structured into sections that describe modeling properties of concurrent systems, proposing algebraic semantics for the relational diagrams, presenting transformation rules, and discussing techniques for induction and coinduction, all supported with examples. It concludes with a discussion on the results and potential paths for future work.

The authors note that formal theoretical groundwork for related concepts like Kleene algebras can be found in the existing literature, but in this paper, they have chosen to focus on the practical application of their ideas through examples, leaving the implementation of the calculus and full integration into formal methods for future endeavors.
