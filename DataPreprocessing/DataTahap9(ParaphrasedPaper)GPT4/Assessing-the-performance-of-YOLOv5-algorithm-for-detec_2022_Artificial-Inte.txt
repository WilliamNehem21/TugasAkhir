The Boll Weevil (Anthonomus grandis L.) has historically been a significant problem for the U.S. cotton industry, causing over $23 billion in damages since the 1890s. The insect is particularly challenging in the Lower Rio Grande Valley in southern Texas due to the area's warm climate and proximity to Mexico, which allows for year-round cotton growth and recurrent re-infestations. In efforts to combat this pest, spray-capable unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) are used to apply pesticides such as malathion, which, while effective, can also harm humans and beneficial insects if not used properly.

The paper discusses the importance of accurately detecting volunteer cotton (VC) plants, cotton plants unintentionally growing in fields of other crops, which can harbor boll weevils. It examines the effectiveness of four versions of the object detection algorithm YOLOv5—small (YOLOv5s), medium (YOLOv5m), large (YOLOv5l), and extra-large (YOLOv5x)—in identifying VC plants among corn at three different corn growth stages (V3, V6, and VT). Each version varies in complexity and parameter count, impacting their detection capabilities.

In an experimental setup, different varieties of cotton were planted in a corn field in Weslaco and a test field in Burleson County to evaluate the algorithms' performance. The study revealed a typical issue of class imbalance, with fewer instances of VC plants compared to the larger number of background classes like corn with weeds, which could bias classification algorithms towards the more common class.

A significant finding was that there is a balance to be struck between the accuracy of detecting VC plants and the area that can be covered by the UAS; higher altitudes cover more ground but may reduce image resolution and detection accuracy. The study suggests that surveying at the V3 corn growth stage might be preferable despite lower detection accuracy since it allows for monitoring of a larger area. Detection accuracy might also be enhanced using preprocessing techniques from a GitHub repository provided by Micasense.

In summarizing, the paper emphasizes the operational benefits of using advanced object detection models like YOLOv5 for identifying VC plants within cornfields, which could lead to more efficient Boll Weevil Eradication Program practices and minimize the costs related to chemical controls.
