In this study, we explore the connections between the Fusion Calculus and graph transformations that use Synchronized Hyperedge Replacement (SHR) styled after Milner synchronization. We reveal that these systems share an analogous algebraic framework, despite Fusion Calculus operating through interleaving actions and SHR functioning through concurrent actions. A novel interleaving semantics for SHR with Milner synchronization is proposed to establish a full match between the Fusion Calculus's operational semantics and those of SHR systems.

We demonstrate a precise match between Fusion Calculus (equipped with guarded sum and recursion) and a subset of SHR, hinging on both models featuring related parallel composition and restriction operators, which are integral for constructing systems and managing local names. Additionally, the mobility mechanisms in each model share significant similarities. The key distinction lies in the semantics: Fusion Calculus processes one synchronization at a time through interleaving, whereas SHR inherently permits concurrent synchronizations. To align SHR with Fusion Calculus's step-by-step synchronization, we impose an interleaving semantics on SHR, achieved by implementing specific inference rules. These rules reshape SHR's transition system to emulate multiple Fusion Calculus steps in a single SHR transition.

SHR is a method for hypergraph transformation where global changes result from localized production rules that prescribe the rewriting of hyperedges and the affiliated conditions on connected nodes. By piecing together these production rules, as long as they meet the necessary compatibility requirements—which depend on the chosen synchronization model—a global transformation unfolds. The models for synchronization, such as Hoare's and Milner's, differ in their specifications. SHR transformations also encompass node mobility, wherein node references can be conveyed during a transformation, leading to the unification of the associated nodes.
