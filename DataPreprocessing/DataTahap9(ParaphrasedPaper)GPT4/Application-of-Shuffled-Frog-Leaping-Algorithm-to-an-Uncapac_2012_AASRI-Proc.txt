The Shuffled Frog Leaping Algorithm (SFLA) is an emerging metaheuristic approach increasingly gaining attention in optimization studies within both academic and practical engineering contexts. As a hybrid of the Memetic Algorithm (MA) with its robust local search capabilities and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) known for its effective global search performance, SFLA offers a powerful method for identifying optimal solutions and is straightforward to deploy. The paper focuses on examining the suitability of SFLA in addressing an uncapacitated single level lot-sizing (SLLS) problem and evaluates its performance against alternative heuristic algorithms, demonstrating its feasibility and efficiency.

Genetic Algorithms (GAs) and PSO have been previously used to tackle multi-level lot-sizing problems, with SLLS representing a specific instance of these broader problems. SFLA, introduced by Eusuff and Lansey in 2003, merges the strengths of MA and PSO and has quickly become a topic of interest in the realm of intelligent optimization. Despite its potential, few studies have applied SFLA to the SLLS scenario. The authors address this gap by implementing SFLA in C++ to validate its usefulness as a tool for solving SLLS problems.

The metaheuristic SFLA simulates the memetic evolution of frogs as they search for the location with the most abundant food. In SFLA, a frog population, which represents potential solutions, is divided into subgroups called memeplexes, mirroring diverse frog cultures. Within these memeplexes, the best-performing frog (xb) and the least fit frog (xw) are identified, alongside the overall top-performing frog (xg), across the entire population. The algorithm employs a mechanism similar to PSO to refine the solution represented by xw within each memeplex.

For the specific SLLS problem, solutions take the form of binary vectors that correspond to production decisions (e.g., when to produce or not) over a series of time periods, informed by known product demands. This direct correspondence allows inventory levels and associated costs to be readily calculated from the solution vector.

The SFLA then uses a crossover operator, akin to that used in GAs, where the best and worst performing frogs within a memeplex are hybridized to generate new potential solutions. Following an evaluation of their performance based on the objective function, the superior solution is retained, and the inferior one is discarded.

The study's primary contribution is the novel application of SFLA to the SLLS problem, which yielded promising results. Looking forward, the authors plan to expand their experimental framework to more complicated product configurations and larger scales, along with integrating additional heuristic strategies into the SFLA to further enhance its performance.
