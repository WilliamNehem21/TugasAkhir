The academic paper articulates the importance of delineating high-risk landslide zones through scientific methods in order to inform land-use planning and safety measures. It discusses the steps taken to model landslide susceptibility, which include selecting and testing relevant landslide contributing factors (LCFs) via techniques like multicollinearity analysis and Relief-F. Thematic layers of the LCFs were prepared for this purpose. Additionally, a set of benchmark models, including Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Kernel Logistic Regression (KLR), Random Forest (RF), and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), were used to simulate landslide susceptibility.

Selecting appropriate LCFs for modeling is a complex task with no universal standard, as different regions may require consideration of unique environmental, geological, and hydrological variables. Some studies have used mathematical techniques to determine the most significant LCFs. The Relief-F test is one such method for identifying geo-environmental factors relevant to landslide occurrence.

Multicollinearity (MC) testing is employed to ascertain the degree of independence among LCFs. Given that high intercorrelations can lead to inaccurate assessments of landslide-prone areas, this process involves statistical measures like Pearson correlation coefficients, percentage of variance, variance inflation factors (VIF), conditional indices, and tolerance levels to assess the MC among factors.

Local factors, such as the geological, environmental, and hydrological conditions, influence the occurrence of landslides. The study selected specific geo-environmental LCFs that are essential for mapping and identifying areas at risk for landslides.

Regarding the machine learning methods mentioned, the MLP method does not presuppose a statistical distribution of the input variables, and its relative importance is determined during the training process. The MLP has input layers representing the LCFs, hidden layers that help process the data, and output layers that indicate landslide or no landslide occurrences.

Bagging ensembles, an approach introduced by Breiman (1996), were used to predict landslide susceptibility utilizing base classifiers like MLP, KLR, RF, and MARS in conjunction with a meta-classifier. This process involves creating new training data subsets through bootstrap sampling and using techniques like plurality voting.

Model validation is critical to ensure reliability, and various statistical measures (such as MAE, RMSE, and ROC curve analysis) are employed to assess the accuracy of the models used in this study.

The RF method is highlighted for its robustness in handling diverse datasets and producing accurate predictions without suffering from the curse of dimensionality. RF models work with a forest of decision trees, allowing for a comprehensive analysis and handling of data variation, and are initiated with a bagging process.

The study also emphasizes the value of quantitatively evaluating the relationship between LCFs and landslide occurrence to enable planners and stakeholders to predict the impacts of each factor on landslide risk. The authors note that certain variables may be significant in one model but negligible in another. Using an RF model, the paper assesses the contribution of various LCFs to landslide risk and finds that factors such as slope and soil depth vary in their influence, with slope having a higher significance than soil depth.
