Alice and Bob engage in a strategy game involving the proper coloring of vertices in a finite graph G with t colors, taking turns during the process. Bob wins if a situation arises where an uncolored vertex has no remaining colors to be assigned. The smallest value of t that allows Alice to always win is known as the game chromatic number for graph G. It has been established that the game chromatic number for forests (graphs without cycles) is at most 4. The paper focuses on determining precise game chromatic numbers for a specific infinite subset of forests, known as caterpillars, contributing to the broader issue of defining forests by their respective game chromatic numbers. Additionally, the paper presents two sufficient conditions and two necessary conditions that determine whether a given tree or caterpillar has a game chromatic number of exactly 4.
