This article examines the utilization of direct search optimization methods, with a focus on the Mesh Adaptive Direct Search (MADS) algorithm, in solving blackbox optimization problems over the past twenty years. The discussion is primarily centered on MADS applications in energy, materials science, and computational engineering design, while also acknowledging its usage in other scientific and engineering domains, including patents.

The use of MADS, and the development of its supportive software NOMAD, has been highlighted as a prevalent tool in various optimization scenarios. The article outlines notable challenges encountered during optimization, such as high failure rates in simulations related to helicopter rotor blade design and chemical engineering processes.

The text also describes how MADS handles complex problems by allowing users to group variables, suggesting relationships among them and generating search directions within each subset, rather than across the full variable space.

A case study from HQ detailing the replacement of MATLAB Optimization Toolbox with a trust-region approach for electrical parameter estimation is presented. Despite the speed of the new method, the default settings were unsuitable for producing quality results, leading to NOMAD's application in adjusting the settings for better outcomes.

The article emphasizes MADS' effectiveness in materials science for optimizing material performance, industrial processes, and designing new materials. It discusses the challenge of identifying optimal alloys with desirable properties due to the complexity and computation time involved. An approach for determining low-cost phase change materials (PCMs) with good heat storage capacity is also presented, using MADS to identify optimal materials.

Additionally, NOMAD has been utilized for the design of metamaterials, with a focus on adapting their spectral response for desired characteristics.

The authors contrast heuristic approaches, such as genetic algorithms and particle swarm optimization, which lack a convergence theory, with modern direct search methods supported by convergence theory, as in the case of MADS.

They reflect on the evolution of MADS, noting its versatility to consider continuous, discrete (including categorical) variables, address blackbox constraints, multiple objectives, tackle large problems using parallel computing, and even solve stochastic blackbox issues. Success stories and improvements in optimization results across various engineering designs, including thermal insulation systems and drug delivery with nanoparticles, underscore the efficacy of MADS.

Lastly, the paper mentions applications of direct search methods in astrophysics and the analysis of galaxy kinematics, marking a growing dependence on the MADS algorithm in practice. In sum, the review showcases the diverse applications of direct search methods, particularly MADS, in blackbox optimization across multiple scientific and engineering disciplines.
