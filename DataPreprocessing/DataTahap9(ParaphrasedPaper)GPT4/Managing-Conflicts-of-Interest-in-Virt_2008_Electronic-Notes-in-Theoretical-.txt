This paper introduces a formal model for virtual organizations (VOs) that accounts for conflicts of interest, employing the Event-B refinement methodology. The model adopts an incremental development strategy, evolving from high-level abstract concepts of goals and organizations to more concrete elements like resource allocation. The inspiration for this model stems from VOs typically seen in scientific research environments. At a high-level abstraction, organizations within a VO can pursue conflicting goals, while at a concrete level, a mechanism for separating resources ensures that no single resource is allocated to two conflicting goals.

Rapid VO formation requires potential partners to be ready for collaboration, which involves common infrastructure, rules, and capabilities representation. To support this, the concept of a virtual breeding environment (VBE) is proposedâ€”a collection of organizations committed to long-term cooperation and shared operational standards aimed at engaging in VOs.

The paper adopts a goal-oriented perspective of VOs, where participating organizations join a VBE, declaring their goals and resources. Leveraging examples like the management of scientific experiments utilizing large facilities, the paper explores such an environment where scientists from different organizations collaborate, even when their home organizations might have competing research interests.

Event-B, a refinement-focused methodology extending the B language, is employed for the VO model development. With Event-B, one can iteratively evolve a system model, starting with a highly abstract specification and progressively adding detail layers until a satisfactory detailed model emerges, culminating in the final implementation.

The paper introduces the model's abstract context, the VBE, which defines sets for goals, participating organizations, and VO lifecycle statuses. Additionally, it outlines a 'conflict of interest' (COI) set that identifies competing goals. The proposed VO machine models the VO lifecycle in three phases: selection, operation, and dissolution, with relevant variables and transition events for each stage.

A key aspect is managing conflicts of interest by isolating resources tied to conflicting goals, ensured by an invariant that enforces separation policies and is elaborated on both abstract and concrete levels. The model demonstrates how this 'Chinese wall' policy is applied to separate resources within each organization that might be allocated to conflicting goals.

This paper lays the groundwork for VO conflict of interest analysis, a novel approach in the literature. Comparatively, it notes similar work around dynamic coalitions, but those do not typically address the conflict-of-interest dimension. The research herein contributes a significant piece to the puzzle, providing a foundational formal model that can be utilized for the effective management of VOs, particularly in contexts where conflicts of interest are a concern.
