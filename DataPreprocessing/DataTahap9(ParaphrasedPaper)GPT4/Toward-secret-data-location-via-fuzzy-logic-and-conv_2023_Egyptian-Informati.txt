Steganography falls within information security, and it focuses on hiding secret messages within multimedia, using digital media like images as a covert channel. Typically, a steganographic technique embeds a secret message within an original digital medium's pixels, transforming it into what's known as a stego image, while maintaining the appearance of the original or cover image. Over the past two decades, there have been notable advancements in image steganography with development in content-adaptive methods that prioritize the secrecy of the embedded data during the encoding process.

Stego images are typically indistinguishable from cover images by the human eye, challenging steganalysts whose job it is to differentiate between the two. Steganalysis is divided into various types: detective (determining if an image is a cover or stego), locative (identifying the location of hidden data), quantitative (estimating the payload size), and forensic (extracting secret message bits). While some researchers have concentrated on binary classification, locating hidden data has been less explored, often limited to basic steganographic techniques like LSB replacement and matching, due to their detectable anomalies.

Recent improvements in steganalysis have leveraged rich models and ensemble classifiers, with deep learning methods increasingly applied to discern between cover and stego images. The paper is structured by first examining existing literature for current methods and their challenges, then describing a proposed model and approach. This is followed by presenting and discussing experimental results, and finally concluding with future directions in line with the model.

Liu et al. (2015) presented a steganalysis method that detects hidden information in the spatial domain by comparing pixel distribution between stego and cover images. Fuzzy logic, another technique commonly applied in various computer science applications, was utilized by Liu et al. to track pixel changes caused by adaptive steganography. Their method proved effective but less so for non-adaptive steganography due to the more random spread of pixel alterations. They also touched upon challenges in using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for payload location, with issues such as redundant or lost information due to inappropriate kernel sizes.

The paper's algorithm excels in locating likely altered pixels by adaptive steganography and gauges its success by analyzing the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The ROC curve reflects the balance between true positive and false positive rates at various threshold settings. Their findings indicate that the proposed method surpasses previous strategies for certain steganographic algorithms, as evidenced by improved F1-scores.

In summary, the paper introduces a new steganalysis scheme that utilizes image modification maps to pinpoint altered pixels, showing superiority over other methods in certain scenarios. This strategy is particularly adept at detecting hidden data in the spatial domain when adaptive steganography is used. While the approach is promising for locating adaptive steganography, its performance might be contingent on how accurately the steganographic method generates the modification maps.
