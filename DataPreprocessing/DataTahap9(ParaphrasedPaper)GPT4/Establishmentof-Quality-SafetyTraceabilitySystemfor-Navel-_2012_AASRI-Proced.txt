The academic paper discusses the importance of implementing a traceability system for managing the quality and safety of food, with a focus on navel oranges produced in the central mountain area of China. Many countries are recognizing the need for food traceability systems, and this study outlines the technology and key findings related to tracking the quality and safety of navel oranges.

The proposed traceability technology for oranges is broken down into three main components: information collection, information processing, and information services. The information collection stage involves documenting the entire journey of navel oranges from planting to sale, identifying business processes, analyzing potential hazards, and pinpointing factors that influence the oranges' quality and safety. This stage results in the creation of a traceability data center, which compiles data on processing, quality control, logistics, and marketing to support full traceability.

At the information processing level, quality management methods such as Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) are used to analyze and identify critical quality and safety indicators for navel oranges. The study also examines how encoding information technology can facilitate information exchange and management.

Furthermore, the research investigates the development of a quality tracking and tracing coding system for oranges, which is in line with international standards such as EAN/UCC and focuses on raw materials and batch production codes. This coding system enables traceability of the navel oranges from farm to table and ensures rigorous tracking of the oranges' quality and safety throughout the supply chain.
