Hayward et al. undertook a study on the creation, implementation, and assessment of an Electronic Integrated Care Pathway (EICP) within a specialized healthcare facility for mothers and their infants. The EICP system was crafted using Microsoft Access. The team measured its operational effectiveness through surveys and focus group discussions among users involved in the system's initial development phase.

The methodology of the study included a two-step process for variance analysis:

1. Identifying the category causing the variance based on the content and associated keywords. Variance categories could include issues related to patient conditions (such as refusal of treatment), system inefficiencies within the hospital (like delayed testing), issues with the care providers (e.g., omission of discharge instructions), or family-related challenges (for instance, family reluctance to take on post-discharge responsibilities).

2. The actual cause of the variance reported by the user is analyzed by extracting keywords from the sentence describing the variance. These keywords are then broken down based on the grammatical composition of the sentence—into subject, object, and predicate—to clarify the reasons for the variance. Examples of such extracted keywords could be hospital department closures on weekends, delays in patient education, or family noncompliance.

To address the issue of unregistered or unknown words in the variance database, a combined thesaurus system, including a general published thesaurus and a specialized psychiatry thesaurus, was proposed for processing these terms. This system aims to analyze variances automatically using a newly developed tool known as the Variance Analysis Knowledge Base (VAKB). This method is designed to improve upon traditional manual sorting approaches, which are often reliant on the analyst's experience and intuition.

The paper discussed challenges such as collecting a substantial amount of variance data necessary for refining the analysis method and the development of an extensive thesaurus, which is critical since the classification system depends on the usage of thesauri. Future goals of the study include gathering more data on system errors, bugs, and variances with an eye toward enhancing the EICP system.
