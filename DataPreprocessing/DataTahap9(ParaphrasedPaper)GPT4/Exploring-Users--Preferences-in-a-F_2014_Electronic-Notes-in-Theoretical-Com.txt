Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) is a data analysis framework grounded in lattice theory. It begins with formal objects, attributes, and an incidence relation that specifies object-attribute connections, creating a formal context. This context enables the calculation of formal concepts, each with a conceptual extent (all objects with the shared attributes) and intent (common attributes of those objects). These are ordered by subconcept-superconcept relationships. FCA has been expanded into a fuzzy variant to manage imprecise statements, proving valuable across diverse applications such as social networks and inconsistent data sets. This paper extends previous work, offering new insights on the interplay between certain formulas, closure operators, and computing minimal formula sets, and applies this to real-world data.

Fuzzy theory has seen significant theoretical and practical successes, with the fuzzy controller by Mamdani and Assilian being a prime example. This paper also elaborates on the application of verbal descriptions to truth values in a residuated lattice, enhancing user comprehension.

In this work, formulas are introduced to manage data effectively, including strategies to reduce redundancy for user convenience. For example, in a concrete case, an "L-concept" with an intent describing cities with top-notch job markets and affordable housing is studied. Additionally, proposition 4.9 is discussed, demonstrating formula reduction and testing semantic entailment.

To address certain issues, the paper adopts a new approach akin to dealing with fuzzy attribute implications by defining a suitable closure operator, which possesses the requisite properties and presents an algorithm for L-set computation with respect to a set of formulas. This allows for a more manageable and user-friendly set of non-redundant formulas, facilitating easier modification and handling by the user.
