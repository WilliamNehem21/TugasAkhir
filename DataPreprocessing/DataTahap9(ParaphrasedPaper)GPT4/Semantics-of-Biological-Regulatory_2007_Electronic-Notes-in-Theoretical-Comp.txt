The influx of vast quantities of gene expression data underscores the importance of computational approaches to address the challenges in interpreting experimental outcomes. Rather than simplifying our understanding of biological systems, this data highlights the complexity of analyzing their functions. The diversity and interactivity of different components necessitate dealing with their intricacies. Consequently, this has led to the advancement of modeling techniques for exploring computational biology.

The structure of the paper is as follows: Section 2 provides a foundational understanding of Biological Regulatory Networks (BRN). The main content of the paper is found in Section 3, where a formal semantic framework for BRN is presented. In Section 4, the application of the HyTech tool is demonstrated using a simplified example to analyze a BRN.
