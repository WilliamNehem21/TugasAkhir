Title: Machine Learning Techniques in Nonlinear Time Series Analysis for Financial Market Prediction

Abstract/Summary: 
Time series data, particularly in financial markets, are inherently noisy and complex, often containing nonlinear patterns. However, recent developments in machine learning have provided powerful tools to address these issues. This paper discusses various machine learning methods, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Functional Link Artificial Neural Networks (FLANN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM), that have been applied to financial time series prediction over recent decades.

Section 1: The paper reviews research that concentrates on promising approaches used in the financial domain for enhancing prediction results.

Section 2: Detailed information regarding the dataset and how it has been regenerated is provided.

Section 3: An in-depth presentation of predictive models is given.

Section 4: Statistical and optimization-based techniques for feature reduction are examined to improve model performance.

Section 5: The analysis of experimental results is presented, showing a schematic of the proposed prediction model, along with parameter setups, detailed steps of the proposed algorithm, and experimental analysis.

The Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is highlighted as an efficient algorithm based on a Single Layer Feed-forward Neural Network (SLFN). Unlike traditional SLFNs that require iterative tuning of hidden layer weights and biases, ELM simplifies this process, resulting in faster learning speeds, lower training errors, and smaller weight norms. This efficiency is partly due to the use of the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse.

Feature reduction methods are introduced to enhance model training by focusing on the most relevant features of the original datasets. Both statistical and optimization-based techniques are employed for this purpose.

Factor Analysis (FA) postulates that observable variables are composed of linear combinations of latent factors, with some common to multiple variables and others unique to each. This differs from Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which creates principal components through mathematical functions of observed variables, rather than identifying underlying common factors responsible for correlations among the variables.

The Firefly Algorithm (FA) is primarily concerned with variations in light intensity and attractiveness, which are tied to the objective function. Its computational complexity is O(m^2), but larger population sizes can increase time complexity.

Experimentation parameters, such as population size and iteration count, are standardized across all models to control for computational efficiency and solution quality. A population size of 100 and 100 iterations are chosen for a balanced comparison.

For data preprocessing, min-max normalization and feature reduction are applied, using PCA and FA for statistical-based reduction and Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and a Firefly Algorithm within an evolutionary framework for optimized-based reduction. The resulting reduced data are then fed into predictive models like ELM, Online Sequential ELM (OSELM), and Radial Basis Probabilistic Neural Network (RBPNN).

Four stock market datasets (BSE Sensex, NSE Nifty, S&P 500 index, and FTSE 100 index) are selected for model evaluation, each representing major indices from Indian, American, and British stock exchanges.

Results show that ELM, particularly with features reduced by PCA and FA, performs better for one-day-ahead predictions compared to forecasts over longer time horizons. The study also explores optimization-based feature reduction methods like GA, Firefly, and Firefly Algorithm with evolutionary framework, which are designed to find optimal solutions while avoiding local minima traps. This hybrid approach combines strengths of both techniques for improved solution quality.
