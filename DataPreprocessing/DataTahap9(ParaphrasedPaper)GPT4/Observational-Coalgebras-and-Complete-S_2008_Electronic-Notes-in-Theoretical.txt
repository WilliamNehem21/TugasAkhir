The academic paper introduces the concept of an "observational coalgebra," which is a specific way to represent a set X. This representation is notable for having two essential characteristics: strong extensionality and relative finality. Strong extensionality forms the foundation of a logical proof principle that applies to observational coalgebras, while relative finality is central to defining constants and functions on these coalgebras in a coinductive manner.

However, the paper acknowledges that the idea of an observational coalgebra is rather abstract and, as such, can be impractical for direct application. To address this, the paper shifts focus towards a more tangible concept, which is described as a "complete set of co-operations." To define this concept, the paper introduces the terms "cosignature" and "co-operation." It then proceeds to outline the criteria that determine when a set of co-operations can be regarded as complete, making it a more workable construct within the theoretical framework.
