Upon receiving an ack(stamp) message, if a worker is currently engaged in a task, it disregards the message. However, this implies that the coordinator should eventually receive an active message from that worker. The global termination is confirmed by the coordinator when it collects p ack(stamp) messages, meaning that the acknowledgement counter equals the number of workers (p). Once this global termination is confirmed, the coordinator can notify all workers to stop by sending out a message indicating termination status (trm status=stop).
