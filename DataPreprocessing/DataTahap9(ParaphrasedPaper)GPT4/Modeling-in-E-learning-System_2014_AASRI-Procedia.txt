Educational material design encompasses a spectrum of learning theories, primarily behaviorism, cognitivism, socio-constructivism, and humanism. Behaviorist approaches help teach factual information, vital for presenting formulas, algorithms, or mathematical concepts like the natural spline method in course delivery. Cognitivist tactics focus on imparting procedural knowledge necessary for understanding and applying numerical methods in this context. Constructivist strategies, meanwhile, aim to cultivate advanced cognitive skills.

Prior to delving into the lesson content, diverse pre-learning activities can be employed to ready the student, highlighting the benefits and significance of online lessons. In order to achieve the desired learning outcomes, a plethora of activities can be introduced during the learning process. Interaction is key: students must engage with the digital interface to access materials, assimilate content to build a knowledge foundation, and connect with peers and educators, facilitating the application of what they've learned to real-world scenarios.

The role of online course designers and teachers involves selectivity, adaptation, and refinement of educational activities—an iterative process enhanced by reflection, feedback, and evaluation—to leverage the web's potential. The first step in theory development within online education often begins with the construction of a model that demonstrates the critical variables interacting to shape online contexts and learning experiences.
