The academic paper discusses Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), a technique that relies on simple mathematics to achieve fast convergence rates, making it prevalent in optimization tasks since its creation in 1995. Despite numerous improved PSO variants, many are tailored to specific types of optimization problems.

Focusing on combining Differential Evolution (DE) algorithms with PSO, the paper introduces a Mutual Learning Differential Evolution Particle Swarm Optimization (MLDE-PSO). This hybrid utilizes mutual learning to leverage the strengths of both DE and PSO subswarms, enhancing population quality via information exchange. It incorporates elite mutation to hasten DE convergence.

A systematic review of related research (Section 2), a detailed methodology (Section 3), and experimental analysis (Section 4) elucidate the process. The MLDE-PSO is benchmarked against seven peer algorithms, showing its proficiency across diverse problem types in the CEC2017 function set. It often outperforms classic PSO variations and a standard DE algorithm, particularly in unimodal, simple multimodal, and hybrid function optimization. However, its performance on composition functions and penalty functions is less dominant.

The hybrid approach employs DE mutation with information from the PSO subswarm for faster reactivity and an elite DE mutation to further enhance exploitation. Experimentation reveals that MLDE-PSO generally surpasses traditional and contemporary PSO and DE algorithms. It exhibits resilience to rotational transformations in functions and holds potential for application to constrained test functions and real-world optimization challenges in future research.
