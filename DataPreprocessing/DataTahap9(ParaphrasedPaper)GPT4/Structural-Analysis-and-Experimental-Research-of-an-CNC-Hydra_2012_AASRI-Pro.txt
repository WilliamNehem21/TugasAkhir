The paper discusses the constraints and setup for a finite element analysis (FEA) of a frame's undersurface, which is fully restricted in movement, reflecting actual conditions. At the centers of the left and right plates of the tool carrier, two reference points are created with rotational freedom only around the local x-axis, and they correspond with two separate holes. To eliminate any rigid shifts of the tool carrier, constraints are imposed on the y and z translations at the contact points between the cylinders and the tool carrier in the global coordinate system. The bottom part of the frame is divided into tetrahedral elements for meshing, while the beams and tool carrier use hexahedral elements.

In the analysis, 15 points are specifically positioned along the static tool apron and connected with both the bottom and front of the apron. Shear force and horizontal thrust are applied incrementally in 16 steps, with the interaction between force applications being removed to ensure that each force only takes effect during its designated step.

Before applying shear and horizontal thrust during the initial step, the minimum stress identified at the throat fillet is 71.71 MPa, and the smallest displacement measured at the top of the front vertical plate of the frame is 0.1634 mm.

A comparison of the analysis with experimental data shows discrepancies of around 20%, attributed to environmental factors from the testing location. For instance, the sheer force used in calculations was derived from a standard formula and was larger than the actual value, resulting in higher shear stress in the subsequent FEA. Except for a few test points, the overall data is within acceptable limits. This confirms the reliability of the FEA approach employed, and indicates that the calculated maximum stress on the throat fillet aligns with its actual operational conditions.
