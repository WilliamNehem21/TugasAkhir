The paper discusses the challenges and solutions associated with the fusion of two 3D medical images, especially when aligning small but critical areas such as the caudate nuclei and putamen in the brain. Due to technological limitations, medical imaging equipment can't zoom in for better detail, making it necessary to apply mathematical methods to aid surgeons.

The paper references the simplicity of the 2D situation where lattice periodicity and intersection problems are more straightforward to understand through continued fractions. However, these lattice properties don't extend to higher dimensions, although 2D instances provide insight into useful concepts for higher dimensions, such as plane sections of voxel spaces.

Computational geometry algorithms, typically used to describe convex polyhedra, are not well-suited for medical imaging due to their avoidance of degenerate cases and the fact that current implementations with floating-point arithmetic do not preserve lattice properties.

The paper emphasizes the gap between theoretical algorithms and practical coding, outlining the need for efficient code that operates within a specific numerical system, like quadratic algebraic numbers. The authors focus on the intersection of two voxel sets, each tiling 3D space with cubes. They employ algorithms for intersecting convex polygons to handle the intersection of tiles and pixels.

Arnold's work on convex hulls of integer points in cones, known as Arnold-Klein sails, suggests a natural extension of continued fractions and relates to the intersection schemes of voxel spaces.

The authors advocate for an algorithmic approach that exploits the symmetries and specific structures of cubes to compute voxel intersections, which can offer exact solutions even in degenerate cases, mitigating the need for complex coding usually required in such scenarios.
