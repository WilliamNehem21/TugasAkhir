Metal Intermetallic Laminated (MIL) composites are developed by reaction sintering of alternating layers of titanium and aluminum foils at various thicknesses. The production process leads to the formation of an intermetallic Al3Ti phase which imparts high hardness and stiffness to the composite material. At the same time, areas of unreacted titanium maintain the composite's overall strength and ductility. The paper provides an examination of the microstructure and selected mechanical characteristics of these layered composites, using the titanium-aluminum system as a reference. It discusses the outcomes of both static and dynamic tests, comparing scenarios in which the intermetallic forming reaction was either incomplete or allowed to finish during the sintering process.

The research included detailed electron microscope analysis which was carried out at the Electron Microscopy Center of Collaborative Access, linked to the Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Mechanical properties were evaluated at the Testing Center of Advanced Materials and Nanotechnology, also part of the Ural Branch. Furthermore, impact toughness measurements were conducted at the center named "Plastometriya" located within the Institute of Engineering Science, Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
