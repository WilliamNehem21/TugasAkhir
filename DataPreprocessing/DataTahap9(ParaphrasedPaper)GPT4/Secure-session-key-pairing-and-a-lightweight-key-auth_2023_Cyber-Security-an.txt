In an environment with constrained resources, drones forming a network have limited capacity, computational power, and battery life. These networks transmit sensitive and critical real-time data among organizations via unsecured communication channels, demanding assurance of the integrity and mutual trustworthiness of all parties while protecting confidential information. Due to their restricted capabilities, drones cannot employ complex multifactor authentication methods such as fingerprint recognition, bilinear map pairings, or digital certificates.

With the goal of minimizing computational and communication overhead, researchers have developed an Authenticated Key Agreement (AKA) method using only hash functions and XOR operations, which offers lightweight yet effective security for drone networks. However, this protocol has not been thoroughly verified using computer-based cryptographic evaluation tools. Other methods, like asymmetric wavelet transform pairing-based key agreements, have been proposed for their low cost, but they also lack formal security proofs.

Building on these approaches, WizID et al. introduced a lightweight AKA technique that employs a fuzzy extractor and hash functions, achieving minimal memory overhead and reduced computational and communication costs. Despite the lightweight nature, this method is susceptible to temporary information attacks by a powerful Canetti-Krawczyk (CK) adversary with access to all protocol messages. To counter this, a privacy-preserving authentication method has been proposed.

Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is suggested as a viable option for public-key algorithms on resource-constrained devices like drones. The proposed system not only allows the expansion of the drone network but also ensures the authenticity and confidentiality of communication, verifiable with the ProVerif cryptographic protocol verification tool.

The performance of the proposed system has been empirically tested using the OpenMote-B hardware platform, demonstrating that operations such as elliptic curve point multiplication and addition are fast and energy-efficient, with the protocol execution falling within acceptable timeframes per the IEEE 802.15.4 standard.

When powered by two AA batteries, the proposed system's energy consumption is minimal, using less than 0.0134 percent of the battery's capacity per operation. Security is further bolstered by the inability of adversaries to reconstruct or predict the shared secret keys between drones.

The proposed mechanisms thus ensure not only cryptographic robustness, evaluated by the ProVerif tool but also operational efficiency. Unique session keys generated for each protocol instance prevent replay attacks and ensure that nodes can't decrypt messages if prior communications are replayed, preserving data integrity across the drone network.
