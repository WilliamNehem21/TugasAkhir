The abstract describes an academic paper that addresses the critical issue of parking space management in modern cities, with a focus on a smaller city as an example. Traffic congestion, high demand for parking spaces, and inappropriate parking choices during peak office hours in commercial areas are ongoing challenges. To address these issues, the paper introduces a novel, intelligent approach that merges tabu search—a meta-heuristic optimization technique—with rough set theory, which deals with uncertainty and imprecision in data.

The tabu search method, first proposed by Glover in 1989, is designed to find optimal solutions by locally searching and using memory structures called tabu lists to avoid revisiting previous solutions. This helps prevent the search from getting stuck in local optima. However, there is a limitation in the size of the tabu list, which can restrict the search too much.

Precise and approximate decisional rules are crucial components of rough set theory, where the former deals with certain judgments based on complete information and the latter with judgments based on partial information. In parking management, rough set theory is utilized to handle data uncertainty involving parking patterns by employing lower and upper approximations to distinguish between elements that certainly or possibly belong to a set.

The hybrid scheme proposed in the paper innovatively integrates the tabu search and rough set methodologies to optimize parking space allocation by considering uncertainty and employing a dynamic approach to the size of the tabu list. The research goes on to fine-tune parameters like the tenure (related to the problem size), and it specifically takes into account bi-directional traffic flow—contrasting the common focus on unidirectional traffic in current literature. The scheme not only addresses the problem of parking space optimization but also provides insights that could be useful for tackling other complex optimization challenges.
