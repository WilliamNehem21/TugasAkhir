Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) consist of numerous small sensor nodes powered by batteries with limited life. Energy-efficient routing is essential in these networks to conserve power. Each sensor node has its energy capacity restricted, which also limits its processing and sensing capabilities. However, when networked together, these sensors can provide enhanced robustness, reliability, and accuracy.

Excessive energy consumption can degrade network performance, hence efficient energy management is crucial within WSNs. We propose a new algorithm designed for use in both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems, utilizing a Merged Layer Technique (MLT) for node deployment, which helps to conserve energy in WSNs. Nodes are randomly arranged in a two-layer structure with equal energy levels and equal probability for head election. Although part of the same network, the two layers form distinct groups. Following the LEACH protocol's principles, nodes relay the data they sense to their Cluster Heads (CHs), who then send the aggregated data to the Base Station (BS). This merged layer approach demonstrates improved energy conservation compared to the traditional LEACH protocol.

The structure of our discussion is as follows: Section 2 reviews related literature; Section 3 details heterogeneous sensor network systems; Section 4 analyzes a sensor network model; Section 5 introduces the MLT protocol; Section 6 discusses simulation results regarding energy consumption, live node count per round, distinct BS locations for the two-layer nodes, and comparative analysis through graphs. Finally, Section 7 concludes the algorithm's potential and future research directions.

We introduce a Cluster Head Relay (CHR) routing protocol for heterogeneous sensor networks. This protocol involves two kinds of sensors—a majority with lower energy and a minority with higher energy—forming a static network with a single sink and knowledge of their location through a localization service. The CHR protocol organizes the network into clusters comprising both sensor types. Lower energy sensors are tasked with sensing their environment and multi-hop forwarding of data packets to their CHs. Higher energy sensors handle data fusion within their clusters and transmit aggregated data packets from other CHs to the sink via multi-hop transmissions between CHs only.

This system ensures energy efficiency by optimizing power consumption and by monitoring the number of active nodes in each round. Its throughput reflects the total volume of data transmitted throughout the network and between nodes and their CHs.

Like LEACH, the proposed model deploys nodes in a two-layer architecture where nodes possess the same energy and equal chances of becoming CHs. However, the two layers are organized differently. The merged layer concept offers superior performance over the traditional LEACH approach.

An energy-efficient CH election protocol for heterogeneous WSN is referenced that considers various types of sensor nodes. To preserve energy for CHs that are more distant from the BS and balance energy use for those closer, a multi-hop routing algorithm for CHs incorporates a factor based on remaining energy and uses minimum spanning tree logic. This protocol lessens the energy usage for CH transmissions and communications between non-CHs and CHs. Simulation shows it outperforms LEACH in enhancing the network life of WSNs. Our algorithm also leverages heterogeneity, such as incorporating 10% higher energy advanced nodes in a (100 m x 100 m) field, further improving performance compared to LEACH's heterogeneity.
