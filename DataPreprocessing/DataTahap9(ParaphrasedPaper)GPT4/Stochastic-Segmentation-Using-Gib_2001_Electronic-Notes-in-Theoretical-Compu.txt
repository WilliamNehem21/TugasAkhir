This paper reports on the development of a stochastic approach to segment magnetic resonance gray-scale images of trabecular bone into binary images using Gibbs priors. This method builds upon an earlier successful technique for reconstructing binary images from projections. The segmentation process aims to distinguish between the presence and absence of particular structures within the gray-scale images, turning them into binary format where '1' represents the presence and '0' the absence of the target structure.

A gray-scale image is defined as a two-dimensional array of pixels with values ranging from 0 to 255, where 0 represents black and 255 white. A binary image assigns each pixel a value of either 0 or 1, with black and 0 being equivalent, as are white and 1.

Segmentation errors resulting in small, isolated components of false white and black pixels are addressed. Post-processing techniques are proposed to refine the segmentation by removing small connected components. Two thresholds are set to determine component removal: 'threshold-white' for the size of white connected components to be converted to black, and 'threshold-black' for black connected components to be converted to white, where the size is defined by the number of pixels in the component.
