This empirical study investigates the lag between the disclosure of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) in the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) and the assignment of Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) scores to these CVEs. Analyzing over 80,000 archived vulnerabilities using regularized regression revealed that (i) CVSS details do not significantly impact the delay in publishing scores, but (ii) a general yearly downtrend significantly reduces these time lags. Furthermore, the paper contributes insights into the misuse of statistical methods in studying software vulnerabilities.

The paper scrutinizes time lags in the context of the NVD and the second version of the CVSS framework, focusing on the CVSS scores' publication following CVE announcements. CVSS is essential for assessing the severity of software vulnerabilities across many sectors, such as healthcare and finance, as well as in government security systems and various commercial products. It is also a common tool in academic research for risk analysis and security assessments.

Despite its widespread use, the paper notes that few studies have looked into the practical process of assigning CVSS scores. This study, hence, aims to understand the factors influencing the time delays in score publication better.

The methodology section defines the dataset and variables, the third section presents the statistical methods and results, and the last section discusses the findings. The study uses the CVSS (version 2) standard and includes various metrics such as confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA), and exploitability.

The findings suggest a strong decreasing annual trend in the publication delays of CVSS scores, minimizing the impact of the content of the CVSS itself on the time taken to publish these scores. The implications of these results are significant, reassuring users of the NVD data feed that there are currently no substantial delays in receiving CVSS information, irrespective of the severity of the reported vulnerabilities.
