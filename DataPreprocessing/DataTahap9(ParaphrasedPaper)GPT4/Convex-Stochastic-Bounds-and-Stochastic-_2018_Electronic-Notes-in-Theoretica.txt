This paper introduces a method to derive stochastic bounds for various optimization problems on graphs with random variable parameters such as costs, weights, or delays. These problems typically use convex operators and have polynomial complexity when parameters are deterministic. However, random variables, specifically discrete random variables representing parameters like link delays, significantly increase the problem complexity, often to NP-complete levels.

The paper proposes providing stochastic upper and lower bounds using convex order relationships. It demonstrates how to simplify discrete distributions into bounding distributions, offering a balance between computational complexity and bound accuracy. An algorithm is also designed for calculating an upper bound within polynomial time. This methodology is exemplified through the calculation of the execution time of a task graph.

The research addresses optimization issues where edge and node parameters are often unrealistically treated as fixed values. In reality, these parameters can fluctuate due to various factors, such as traffic congestion or system failures. The paper suggests that each graph element (node or edge) might have multiple capacity levels with associated probabilities. The goal is to understand the outcome distributions of optimization problems, knowing the probability distributions across nodes and edges.

The paper explores a variety of optimization problems, including max-flow, shortest path, reliability, minimum spanning tree, and completion time, which are based on either convex or concave operators. These problems are significant due to their practical applications and theoretical interest, especially regarding complexity.

The authors differentiate their work from previous studies that used strong stochastic orders to derive bounds for task graph execution times with independently distributed exponential delays. In contrast, this paper handles discrete probability distributions directly from measurements without relying on density fitting algorithms. The central idea is to merge 'atoms' or basic elements in the input distribution to simplify the problem.

The paper details strong stochastic order and convex order concepts, defining the family of optimization problems under examination, all of which are tied to increasing and both convex and concave operators. The process of designing bounds is covered, followed by the presentation of an optimal algorithm for the upper bound.

Using a simple directed graph optimization problem, the authors illustrate their method, which is not contingent on graph properties but rather depends on the operators used in optimization and stochastically ordering. This allows the approach to provide bounds for a variety of similar problems.

A notable result is that using expected values of random task durations instead of their actual random distributions consistently introduces bias. The deterministic result becomes a lower bound under the increasing convex ordering of the distribution.

Lastly, the computational complexity of the algorithm is discussed, with an acknowledgment that while the paper does not establish new complexity results, it does reduce the problem size while maintaining bounds under certain stochastic orders. The concluding sections suggest potential improvements, including investigating connections with other structural approaches and the implementation of these methods in a software tool for studying stochastic bounds.
