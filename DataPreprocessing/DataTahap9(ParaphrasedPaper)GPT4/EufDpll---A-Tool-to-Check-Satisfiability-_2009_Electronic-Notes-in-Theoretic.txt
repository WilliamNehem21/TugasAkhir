The GDPLL method extends the classic DPLL algorithm developed in the 1960s for use in first-order logic. This procedure involves four central operations—reduce, eligible, satCriterion, and filter—which are adapted for specific logical frameworks. When applied to propositional logic, the original DPLL serves as a specific case of GDPLL.

The paper presents an algorithm that solves the satisfiability problem for EUF logic based on the GDPLL framework. To establish the reliability and accuracy of this algorithm, it is examined according to criteria delineated in Section 3 of the paper.

The development of complex systems, notably in hardware and software, is often hindered by testing and verification challenges. The use of theorem provers in the verification of systems like pipelined microprocessors has advanced the field, as shown by Burch and Dill's methodology. Within this context, symbolic terms can represent register states at any computation point, and uninterpreted functions can model combinational logic blocks like the ALU or stand in for constants with significant semantic value.

The foundation of many high-performing propositional satisfiability solvers is the DPLL procedure, created by Davis, Putnam, Logemann, and Loveland. Although originally meant for first-order logic, it has been predominantly applied to propositional logic due to the inefficient handling of quantifiers. GDPLL is a generalized version of DPLL, and the paper broadly outlines its principles while directing readers to additional resources for a comprehensive explanation.

A key algorithm used in propositional logic satisfiability checks is the DPLL algorithm. It is a complete, backtracking-based method that reduces formulas in conjunctive normal form by the unit clause, splitting, and pure literal rules. GDPLL also includes a splitting rule, allowing for a case analysis via an atom a, similar to the DPLL.

Section 4.1 of the paper proves that the reduction rules set forth are terminating, guaranteeing at least one normal form; however, the rules are not confluent, as evidenced by a provided example, which results in the normal form being non-unique.

An eligible function is used to select literals from positive clauses longer than one, meaning a satisfiable status is achieved when a formula's core is empty, and the empty clause is absent.

Experiments on random formulas were performed, applying random substitutions to allow for reduction, typically with 1000 clauses and 10 symbols. The GDPLL-based EUFDPLL algorithm solved all the test problems, though the BarcelogicTools program from the SMT-COMP 2005 competition outperformed it in terms of speed.
