The academic paper discusses the concept and importance of clocks in the SIGNAL programming language, which control the behavior and timing of computations within a program. A clock is triggered by the presence of at least one input variable, such as 'y', and the clock's timing corresponds to the moments when 'y' is present. This time set is called the clock of 'y'.

In this context, a variable acts both as a carrier of data flow and as an intermittent event that can control other operations, similar to the imperative programming model. Clocks serve as the primary mechanism by which a programmer specifies when computations should occur, and they are extensively utilized in SIGNAL. Computations, expressions, and data dependencies are all tied to clocks.

Clocks alone are not enough, as synchronization and under-sampling in SIGNAL rely on the values of boolean variables. For example, the expression 'y := x when c' means that 'y' will only be present if both 'x' and 'c' are present, and if 'c' is true.

The algorithm described in the paper builds partition trees where each clock variable is a tree root and then iterates through a process that involves defining clock variables through syntactical definitions and computing their derivatives while ensuring certain subtree properties are maintained. These properties ensure local context and that dependencies in computations are respected.

If the algorithm results in a single tree, the specification is deemed endochronous, with its primary clock being the root. It iterates by computing definitions involving 'h1 op h2' from the same tree. If no expression satisfies the conditions, rewriting rules are introduced. If these rewriting rules fail to provide a satisfactory expression, the specification is declared not endochronous.

Overall, the paper emphasizes the need to understand fundamental notions such as clocks, how they are formalized as sets of instants (but used as propositional variables), and how they differ from traditional boolean encoding methods. This understanding is critical for grasping the principles of clock calculus and the compilation process in the SIGNAL language.
