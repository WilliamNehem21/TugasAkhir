Recent developments in embedded system design research suggest a paradigm shift from traditional processes, advocating for the modeling of major functionalities at a high level before mapping them onto specific hardware technologies such as DSPs or ASICs. These models employ a range of formalisms to address various aspects of communication, concurrency, and computation. The Ptolemy II system design environment exemplifies this approach, enabling engineers to describe computations using various models such as data-flow networks and discrete-event systems. Tools like Ptolemy II, by decoupling functionality from implementation, aim to streamline the system design process and expedite the verification of designs through the principles of modularity and abstraction. In some instances, automated tools can even generate implementations from these high-level models directly.

The paper unfolds as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of specifying the syntax and semantics of a hardware description language using Maude with an example language called Abel. Section 3 details a framework for specifying and track-checking co-designs, illustrated by two case studies. Section 4 reviews the related work in the field, and Section 5 concludes the paper.

The authors discuss that synchronous digital circuits must adhere to two types of execution order constraints. Within a clock cycle, the combinational network's topology is essentialâ€”each internal node's value is reliable only after its inputs have stabilized and enough time has passed for computation. Additionally, latches across the circuit need to synchronously update concerning a global clock.

Verifying a co-design project demands consideration of both hardware and software interactions, ensuring both system-wide correctness and the validity of partitioning decisions. For example, understanding the interaction of instruction throughput with the actual usage of functional units can prompt a re-evaluation of the hardware design. Similarly, evaluating software complexity and its dependency on hardware can uncover inefficiencies difficult to detect without formal analysis or testing on implemented systems. Validating power-saving features under software execution is similarly crucial in co-design efforts focused on minimizing power consumption.

To aid in co-verification, the paper describes creating a Maude specification for the semantics of hardware description languages (HDLs) like Abel. Maude's rewrite logic capabilities allow for embedding both hardware and software components into a mathematical framework, with support for modeling meta-level system properties, enabling engineers to specify and verify system properties in a natural and modular way.

The discussion continues with practical aspects of property monitoring during simulation and the significance of specifying binary interfaces and register allocation for reliable instruction scheduling. The authors also mention tools for trace checking in digital circuits that can identify property violations through simulation traces.

While industry tools like Xilinx EDK provide some debugging capabilities for hardware/software systems, these tools often lack support for formal analysis and may be limited in their ability to handle interactions between hardware and software.

Finally, the paper acknowledges that modeling the embedded system's operational environment is as important as the hardware/software system itself, though this complex modeling lies beyond the paper's scope. Techniques like real-time rewrite theories and tools like Real-Time Maude are proposed as possible methods to address environmental modeling in future work, which would enhance the understanding and verification of meta-level properties within the system's context.
