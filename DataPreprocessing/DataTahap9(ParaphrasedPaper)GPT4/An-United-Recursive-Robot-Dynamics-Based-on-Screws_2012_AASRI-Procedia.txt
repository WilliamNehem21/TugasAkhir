This paper discusses advances in robotic dynamics, emphasizing the importance of optimal design and control to improve efficiency, a focus of recent research in the field. The authors introduce an efficient recursive forward dynamics algorithm for robots that operates in O(n) computational complexity and is extendable to various robot topologies, such as tree topologies, closed-loop systems, and spatial robot mechanisms. They highlight the use of screw theory in dynamic modeling for its succinct representations and high efficiency, suggesting that screws, which can be represented by pairs of vectors or six scalar quantities in three-dimensional space, are useful tools for expressing dynamic problems.

The paper also touches on the role of Lie algebras and Lie groups, which are algebraic structures associated with the space of screws, SE(3), and their effectiveness in analyzing space mechanisms and in developing algorithms for various geometries and joint structures.

The paper compares the traditional Lagrangian modeling method, which has a computational complexity of O(n^4), with other algorithms such as the Newton-Euler (NE) formula for inverse dynamics and the forward dynamics algorithms developed by Walker and Orin. The proposed screw-based O(n) recursive robot forward dynamics algorithm is described in detail, and its computational complexity is compared with other methods for better understanding.

The authors elaborate on three different O(n) recursive dynamics algorithms: Spatial Operator Algebra (SOA), Articulated Body Algorithm (ABA), and Lie Algebras, all based on the recursive Newton-Euler algorithm for inverse dynamics. For forward dynamics, SOA uses an analogy with Kalman filtering to invert the mass matrix, ABA divides spatial force into components related to acceleration and zero acceleration, and Lie Algebras employ articulated body concepts along with dual adjoint operators.

Finally, the paper explains the mechanism shared by these recursive methods, which involves the interaction of movement parameters and forces within articulated bodies, ultimately leading to an efficient calculation of the dynamic behavior of robots. Different scholars have approached these relationships from various perspectives, resulting in the three described recursive algorithms.
