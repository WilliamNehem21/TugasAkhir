Modal and mixed transition systems are frameworks that permit the combination of both over-approximation and under-approximation within a single specification definition. The paper presents that the following three decision problems associated with these specifications are proven to be of EXPTIME-complete complexity:

1. Determining if a group of modal or mixed specifications share a common implementation.
2. Verifying whether a single mixed specification possesses an implementation.
3. Checking if every implementation of a specific mixed specification is also an implementation of another mixed or modal specification.

These findings are derived through a series of reductions beginning with the acceptance problem for linearly bounded alternating Turing machines (ATMs).

The paper then addresses the importance of the consistency of behavioral models, which serve as specifications. Inconsistent models suggest that these specifications cannot be implemented, whereas consistent models support the possibility of implementation and potentially enable the generation of an implementing code.

The paper is structured as follows:
- Section 2 provides background on alternating Turing machines, specifications, and their associated decision problems.
- Section 3 reports existing boundaries for these problems.
- Section 4 introduces the new EXPTIME-completeness results.
- Section 5 discusses the remaining open questions regarding the complexity of a particular type of mixed specifications, namely modal ones.
- Section 6 contains the conclusion.

The paper builds upon previous work referenced in an overview. It notably advances the results of previous research discussed in detail in Section 3 and aligns this work with the field of generalized model checking, detailed in Section 5.

A significant algorithm is mentioned that can ascertain the existence of a common implementation for more than one modal specification. The complexity of this algorithm is exponential with respect to the number of specifications (k) but remains polynomial when k is fixed. The computed result is a common implementation when one is possible. This aligns with the polynomial bounds derived from consistency checking algorithms for a conjunction of disjunctive modal transition systems.

Specifications within the study denote various components of a Turing machine: tape cell i (Mi), the current head position (Mhead), the finite control (Mctrl), and acceptance (Mexist). A common implementation integrates these specifications, ensuring synchronized actions in terms of the tape actions and the finite control transitions, essentially simulating an accepting computation of the Turing machine on a given input.

The authors state a theorem (Theorem 4.1) that establishes the EXPTIME-hardness of the common implementation (CI) decision problem for modal specifications. Combining this with an upper bound already known, they conclude that CI is EXPTIME-complete. By applying reductions, they also show the EXPTIME-completeness of decision problems C (existence of an implementation for a specific mixed specification) and TR (determining if all implementations for one mixed specification are implementations for another).
