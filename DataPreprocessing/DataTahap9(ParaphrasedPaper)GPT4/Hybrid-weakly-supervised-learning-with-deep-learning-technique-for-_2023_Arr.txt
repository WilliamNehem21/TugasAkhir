The widespread use of social networks has accelerated the spread of information and misinformation alike. Social media platforms often circulate unverified information widely, with little concern for its accuracy. The rapid distribution of false news presents significant challenges to governments and society, negatively impacting various aspects of life. Fake news refers to deliberately created and spread misleading information. Identifying fake news in the vast amount of online content is a daunting task that cannot be managed manually, yet it is crucial to address.

This research proposes a hybrid approach using deep learning to detect fake news. The method involves a novel weakly supervised learning technique to label large datasets of unlabeled data, followed by the use of Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (BiGRU) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) networks for detection. The approach uses Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and Count Vectorizers for feature extraction. By integrating Bi-LSTM, Bi-GRU, and weakly supervised Support Vector Machines (SVM), the model achieved a 90% accuracy rate in identifying fake news, proving highly effective and efficient for such tasks in the absence of labelled data.

Specifically, the study details the problem of fake news proliferation on social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp. An MIT study cited within the paper found that fake news spreads 70% faster than true stories online. Addressing this issue involves examining related works, describing methods of fake news detection centring on weakly supervised learning, and proposing a hybrid approach for recognition.

Several references to other studies employing similar techniques are mentioned, including the use of a hybrid CNN and RNN model, weak social supervision, and ensemble-based deep learning applied to the LIAR dataset. These methods inspired the authors to adopt novel weakly supervised learning strategies for annotating vast amounts of unlabeled data, while comparative deep learning techniques, specifically Bi-LSTM and Bi-GRU, showed superior performance to others like ALBERT and RoBERTa.

The research proceeded with a statistical test to validate the accuracy of the weak labels applied to the data, followed by experiments using a hybrid model combining weakly supervised learning and deep learning. The BiLSTM and BiGRU models outperformed other methods, demonstrating that the proposed method is not only more effective but also more efficient for detecting fake news in large datasets lacking prior labels.
