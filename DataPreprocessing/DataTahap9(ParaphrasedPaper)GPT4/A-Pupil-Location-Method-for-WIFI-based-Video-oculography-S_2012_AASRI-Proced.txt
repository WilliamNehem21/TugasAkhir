Video-oculography (VOG) is a commonly used technique for measuring eye movements. A significant issue with VOG is pinpointing the exact center of the pupil. In recent research, the authors proposed a new method for locating the pupil that relies on morphological operations and the Canny edge detection algorithm, specifically designed for a VOG system that operates using WiFi, which represents their latest contribution to the field. The effectiveness of this newly developed pupil location technique was assessed by having a volunteer perform a sinusoidal eye-tracking task. The data from the experiments indicate that the method effectively tracks eye movements and achieves the desired performance.

The attraction of VOG is increasing due to its precision, minimal artefacts, non-invasiveness, and the ability of the individual being tested to move their head freely. VOG fundamentally involves tracking the movement of the eyes, and a crucial aspect of this process is identifying the exact center of the pupil with precision. Hence, this research aims to (i) introduce a WiFi-based nystagmus analysis system they've created, and (ii) propose a new pupil location method that integrates morphological techniques with the Canny algorithm. Furthermore, (iii) an experiment was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of this method.

The morphological operations described as 'opening' and 'closing' are applied to the binarized image of the eye to enhance the accuracy of pupil detection. 'Opening,' which consists of erosion followed by dilation, smooths the outline of the image and breaks narrow connections. In contrast, 'closing'—dilation followed by erosion—tends to close narrow separations, eliminate small voids, and complete the contours.

The researchers introduced and utilized a new pupil location method within a WiFi-based VOG system, using morphological operations and the Canny algorithm. To validate the effectiveness of this method within the system, they conducted sinusoidal tracking tests with a healthy volunteer. The experimental outcomes demonstrate that the proposed method satisfactorily traces eye movements and meets the expected standards.
