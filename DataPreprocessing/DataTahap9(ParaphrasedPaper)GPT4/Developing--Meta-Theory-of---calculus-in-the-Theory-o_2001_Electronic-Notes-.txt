The paper discusses the lazy, call-by-name calculus (CBN), addressing both untyped and simply typed versions, and examines the development of its theory within the framework of contexts. The theory of contexts is shown to introduce only a minimal overhead to proofs, while also facilitating comparisons with different metatheoretical approaches using higher-order abstract syntax.

One issue with axiomatic approaches like the theory of contexts is assuring the consistency of axioms. The paper points out that the soundness of the theory of contexts has been proven using functor categories model. The theory is effective in managing the metatheory of CBN, making the representation of syntax, semantics, and type systems straightforward, although substituting requires more complex representation as a relationship.

The paper also discusses the Calculus of Inductive Constructions (CIC), which extends the Calculus of Constructions (CC) to include propositions as types under the proofs-as-terms paradigm. Within this setup, types of sort Prop correspond to propositions and types of sort Set correspond to data types.

The type theory that underpins CIC can be applied as a logical framework (LF) to represent inferential processes in logic systems consistently.

One difficulty in using higher-order abstract syntax with inductive types is the occurrence of "exotic terms," which are terms that don't correspond to any objects in the language despite having the correct types. These are usually avoided by using higher-order constructors with non-inductive types or by using auxiliary "validity" judgments.

The interactive proof assistant Coq, which is commonly used to implement CIC, allows users to search for inhabitants of types (proofs) interactively using a variety of tactics. Coq ensures the correctness of proofs through a type checking algorithm.

The theory of contexts is outlined as composed of "occurrence" predicates derived from language signatures and includes an axiom schema for `-expansion to handle higher-order terms.

Moreover, the paper indicates that the theory of contexts aligns with key principles of nominal logic, which deals with syntax involving variable bindings. However, the connection between the two theories warrants further investigation.

Some modern proof editors don't support induction on higher-order types. The paper suggests modal calculus as an alternative metalanguage that avoids the issue of exotic terms and could inform the development of future proof assistants.

The paper focuses on Coq but mentions the applicability of the arguments to any proof assistant based on inductive type theories similar to CIC, acknowledging that the theory of contexts diverges from principles such as the axiom of unique choice, making it inconsistent with systems like Isabelle/HOL.

Finally, it notes some theoretical insights, including the non-essential nature of the `-expansion axiom for the properties of CBN studied and tackling the totality of substitution in CIC by introducing higher-order recursion with dependent types, leaving open the question of whether existing models could be extended to accommodate dependent type theory.
