Paraphrased Version:

In the context of any given downward saturated set (DS), one can straightforwardly establish a C1 evaluation, denoted by v, which assigns a truth value of 1 to each signed formula within the set. To ensure the legitimacy of this evaluation, it is crucial to note two foundational aspects. Firstly, the set excludes contradictory pairs such as t x and f x. Secondly, in the realm of C1 KE systems, valuation adherence is maintained throughout; if the premises of a rule all receive a valuation of 1, the conclusion also receives a valuation of 1. Furthermore, if the major premise receives a valuation of 1 and the minor premise a valuation of 0, the valuation for the conjugate of the minor premise becomes 1. These properties ensure the viability of the DS.

It is essential to clarify that this work does not attempt to affirm the decidability of the C1 KE system, which would imply there exists a definitive procedure for verifying proofs within this system. Rather, it briefly introduces the groundwork for a more comprehensive future discussion on developing an operational prover for C1.

The incorporation of a logic system strategy into KEMS (a generic KE-based proof-search system) requires adherence to specific steps. Initially, one should gain familiarity with the structure of KEMS implementation, achievable by delving into the source code. Subsequently, one must undertake the creation of classes that encapsulate the logic system in question, like CPL or C1, and the corresponding KE system classes. Only after these prerequisites can one devise and apply various strategies for a given KE system.

In the case of C1 KE systems, the proposed strategy emphasizes conservative utilization of the PB (Principle of Bivalence) rule, reserving it only as a last resort in accordance with traditional KE procedures. The strategy diverges, however, in the application of the PB rule, as it cannot be limited solely to analytic instances (i.e., instances where the PB formula is a component of another formula already present in the branch). This approach necessitates a more general application of the PB rule.
