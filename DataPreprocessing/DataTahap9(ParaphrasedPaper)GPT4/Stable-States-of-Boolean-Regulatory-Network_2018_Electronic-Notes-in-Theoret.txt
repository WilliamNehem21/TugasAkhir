The complex activities of cells are controlled by intricate networks of molecular regulations. To analyze the behaviors spawned by these regulatory networks, researchers often use a method that simplifies them into Boolean models. These models offer a qualitative view of cellular dynamics, using binary dynamics with a focus on the properties tied to "attractors" and the ability to reach them. For multi-cellular organisms, it’s necessary to incorporate cell-to-cell communication into these models, which is accomplished by joining individual cellular network models using logical rules. This creates an overall model for the collective regulatory mechanisms.

In the framework defined in Definition 2.1, a Logical Regulatory Graph (LRG) is depicted as a graph with nodes representing regulatory elements like genes, and edges indicating the regulatory influences among these elements. Each component is linked to a binary variable indicating its state (on/off or true/false), and logical functions dictate the progression of these states.

While the abstract covers Boolean LRGs, the method can extend to multi-valued LRGs that utilize a wider range of discrete states. This broader application isn’t seen as a limitation since multi-valued LRGs can be systematically transposed to Boolean LRGs, demonstrated in the first case study of section 4.

For practical application in multi-cellular systems, LRGs need to be interconnected as a reflection of their inter-cellular influence. This interconnection is governed by a composition rule 'M', with specific sets 'Zk' derived from the system's topology. Considering each cell contains an identical LRG and assuming a hexagonal, two-dimensional grid arrangement, a simple neighboring relation is defined based on proximity. A cell has up to six immediate neighbors on the grid at distance 1, and may have additional neighbors further away. For instance, at distance 2, a cell could have up to 18 neighbors, which includes the original six plus 12 more. The precise number of neighbors a cell has varies with both the defined distance and the cell’s location in the grid, with those on the edges having fewer neighbors than those in the center.
