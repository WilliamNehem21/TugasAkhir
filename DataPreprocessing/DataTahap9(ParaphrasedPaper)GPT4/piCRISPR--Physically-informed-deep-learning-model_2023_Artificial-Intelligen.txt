To ensure full transparency and comparability in our study, we employed guide-target pairs from the CRISPRsql dataset compiled by our team. This dataset is one of the largest available, containing 17 base-pair resolved off-target cleavage investigations involving Sp-Cas9, with a total of 25,632 data points. The dataset comprises data from several cell types, predominantly U2OS, HEK293, and K562. We selected the version from May 26, 2020, of the CRISPRsql database, intentionally excluding T-cell data from Lazzarotto et al. to prevent an imbalance due to overrepresentation of any single cell line. Evaluating our model on on-target datasets was not considered in this study, as they employ different experimental methodologies and measures for cleavage quantification that are outside our current scope.

When no off-target cleavage was detected by our method at a particular genomic locus that met the specified criteria, we recorded the activity level at that locus as zero. As a result, we ended up with a total of 310,142 guide-target pairs, indicating a significant imbalance in the data. Following the standard practice in the field, we describe this process of increasing the number of data points as data augmentation. In this research, we focused on the 251,854 data points that were derived from human cell lines or synthetic human DNA.

We also consider the possibility of moving beyond using the epigenetic information of the target DNA, which we have duplicated for the guide. This practice is not physically accurate because a synthetic sgRNA does not naturally carry epigenetic markers. Therefore, we suggest that a more appropriate representation would be a one-hot encoded dot-bracket notation of the sgRNA structure, which could better reflect the sgRNA's relevant characteristics.
