Model-based runtime verification represents an advanced approach to monitor and analyze systems by comparing system implementation with both system models and specifications. It involves both checking for consistency between the system implementation and its model and ensuring that the system model adheres to safety specifications. Unlike traditional runtime verification techniques, which must be tightly coupled with system execution, model-based runtime verification operates at the model level. This allows it to run independently of the actual system execution, either preemptively to detect potential issues or subsequently to confirm system behavior. This verification can therefore alternate between proactive pre-checking and reactive post-checking.

Despite the thorough nature of methods like simulation, testing, and model checking in analyzing system behavior, they have limitations. Simulations and testing explore only a subset of possible behaviors, while model checking suffers from state explosion issues and sometimes indeterminate completeness of checked properties. Model-based runtime verification assists here by allowing analysis ahead of system execution, potentially detecting problems before they occur by using observed execution states to navigate and prune the model's state space.

Model-based runtime verification can operate in two modes: pre-checking and post-checking. Pre-checking aims to predict and prevent errors before they occur, while post-checking identifies violations after they have happened. This dual-mode capacity is beneficial for safety-critical systems. To increase the runtime verification's likelihood of staying ahead of system execution, two strategies are introduced to improve its effectiveness and reduce state space exploration.

In practical settings, system properties should be specified by temporal logic formulas such as ACTL/LTL. The paper suggests that by strategically focusing on significant state transitions, based on frequency or importance, the verification process can concentrate on more likely paths, enhancing efficiency without compromising safety. It also recommends updating the focus dynamically based on observed behavior.

The computational complexity of model-based runtime verification is less than that of offline model checking but more than that of traditional runtime verification. Yet, by only looking a few steps ahead at each round, the complexity can be reduced to be more in line with standard runtime verification, making it a feasible option for practical use.

Overall, the paper presents model-based runtime verification as a more flexible and potentially more effective way to maintain system reliability compared to traditional verification techniques, balancing the challenges of complexity and the need for early error detection.
