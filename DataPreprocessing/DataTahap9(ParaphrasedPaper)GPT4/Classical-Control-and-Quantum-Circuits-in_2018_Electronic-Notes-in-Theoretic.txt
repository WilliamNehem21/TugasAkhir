We present categorical models for a circuit-driven functional programming language for quantum computation. Key to this approach is the utilization of enriched categories. Building upon prior work on the QWIRE language by Paykin and others, we explore both a basic first-order linear language for circuits as well as a more complex host language which includes the circuit language. The semantics of the host language are expressed using standard cartesian closed categories and monads, whereas the circuit language is interpreted within an enriched category that draws from the host category.

We discuss an earlier observation that the category of W*-algebras is dcpo-enriched and employ this model to enhance the circuit language, adding recursive types and completely positive maps. High-level languages typically feature more sophisticated structures such as higher-order functions, mixed variance recursive types, and complex control structures like higher-order recursive functions, which are crucial for program development.

Integrating these high-level features with quantum computation requires constructing a semantic domain that supports both the quantum aspects and higher-order features. While some categorical semantics of quantum lambda calculus and our prior work have aimed at reconciling these aspects, the broader relationship between physics and higher-order quantum functions remain elusive, despite some recent advances.

The host language is higher-order and does not include quantum-specific wire types nor a linear type system, yet it does define a special host type for circuits. We also consider set-enriched copowers, a concept previously suggested by Jacobs, and demonstrate their relevance to both quantum and classical enriched effect calculi.

We develop an operational semantics and prove via induction on typing judgments, similar to previous work, that if we have a sound categorical model of the host language, it ensures the correctness of our approach.

As an example, we define a category limited to matrix algebras and positive maps associated with the Clifford group's stabilizer states, labeled as 'Clifford.' This category reflects stabilizer quantum mechanics, which classical computers can efficiently simulate.

Our model proposes that a categorical model of QWIRE in a specified quantum computation category results in a categorical model of QWIRE where algebraic compactness is achieved for locally continuous endofunctors.

In summary, we introduce a new calculus for embedded circuits within an expressive host language, extend QWIRE, and suggest a notion of categorical models explaining their relationship through enriched categories. Our first example is based on the set-enrichment of C*-algebras, and by incorporating W*-algebras and dcpos, we provide a denotational semantics for the quantum Fourier transform.
