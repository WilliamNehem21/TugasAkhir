Over the last ten years, the field of biological modeling has witnessed the rise of several new formal languages and frameworks. Notably, rule-based languages like Kappa and BioNetGen have become prominent, providing a way to represent biological reactions, particularly the transformation of protein complexes, in a concise rule-based format. An example of such a rule in Kappa could be the binding between two proteins, which uses integer labels to signify specific bonds.

Despite the precision of these rules, their complexity can obscure the underlying biological processes they are meant to represent. To address this, the authors introduce an abstraction of Kappa named "Abstract Language" (AL), which simplifies the representation by abstracting away from specific binding sites.

While other work has looked into adding structure to Kappa models, prior approaches have not focused specifically on the binding aspect. Although Kappa's graph-based representation of protein complexes is well-suited for graphical tools, textual representations remain important for model development and further structuring, such as adding modularity.

The authors point out an ambiguity in Kappa rules when binding a protein to multiple possible partners and propose using protein instance numbers to resolve this. This paper also outlines an abstract syntax for Kappa, refashioned for the authors' purposes, which excludes initial conditions for the sake of brevity.

They discuss the longest common prefix as a way to update paired agents based on their position, with agents outside the prefix on the reactants' side being deleted, and new agents on the products' side being created. AL tackles the ordering problem seen in Kappa through instance numbers, creation markers, and deletion markers.

For generating integer binding labels, the authors assume a bijective function that can be defined based on instance and site numbers. In AL, agents and complexes are translated into the Kappa representation, ordering both agents and their sites.

The authors observe that while some Kappa rules can be greatly simplified in AL, others, especially those involving binding exclusion, might become more complex. However, based on an EGFR case study, they note that these more advanced language features are not typically necessary for most rules, and on average, AL rules are 20% shorter than their Kappa counterparts.

The paper suggests that models derived from experimental data could be made more readable by translating them from Kappa to AL. This process should be relatively straight-forward and could lead to a development tool that allows editing in both Kappa and AL views.

Lastly, the authors conclude that, although the research is preliminary, Kappa's semantic representation of protein complex bindings at the binding level might be the most natural approach for managing the combinatorial complexity in the number of protein complexes.
