The paper discusses how expressions are represented with normalized binary decision diagrams (BDDs)/multi-terminal binary decision diagrams (MTBDDs) within their framework, BDDApron. This method improves upon an older framework called APRON as it replaces the concept of constraints with more versatile general boolean expressions. Additionally, BDDApron retains the same operation support as APRON.

Efficient memory management is also a highlight of this work, as abstract values are managed in local variables within recursive procedures, allowing for automatic memory deallocation by the garbage collector. However, this approach does have its drawbacks, such as difficulty in accommodating certain programming constructs like backward GOTO statements, less suitability for unstructured systems, and challenges combining forward and backward analyses due to inherent lack of modularity in certain aspects.

The authors believe in a modular architecture for static analyzers, prioritizing the modularity of the fixpoint solver component and the abstract domain component over the front-end part of the analyzer. They suggest that pushing as much functionality as possible into the solver and abstract domain minimizes code duplication and facilitates comparisons between different abstract domains, as evidenced by their own analyzer, Interproc, which was created to demonstrate the APRON library's utility.

While a modular design can complicate API complexity, the authors feel they have successfully mitigated this in their fixpoint solver, making it user-friendly for external users. However, they acknowledge that the APRON framework's flexibility can be burdensome for users. The quality of their API, they note, benefits significantly from the use of OCaml, a high-level language with features like higher-order functions and polymorphic typing.

Finally, the paper references PAG, a related and mature tool that differs architecturally by integrating the solver, abstract domain, and part of the front-end into a single package and offering a specialized language for defining abstract domain data types and transfer functions.
