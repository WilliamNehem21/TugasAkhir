This academic paper explores homomorphisms in both cases where the category "c" is closed and in instances when it is not. The fifth section presents what the authors believe to be the most significant contribution of the paper: a framework described in terms of generic effects, which extends prior work on Lawvere theories. The sixth section delves into the characterization of algebraic operations through the lens of operations on the category T-Alg, providing insights for integrating call-by-name programming languages with computational effects. The paper concludes with a seventh section that summarizes the findings and suggests potential avenues for future research.

When discussing algebraic operations in the realm of computing, these typically involve operators applied to expressions. However, another perspective considers the arrows of category CT as fundamental, viewing them as stand-ins for programs. This approach draws upon prior work that redefined the semantics for finite nondeterminism. The authors propose to revisit the concept of algebraic operation from this vantage point, invoking Proposition 3.1 as a key element. To clarify the rationale behind coherence conditions, the paper initially assumes that category "c" is closed, explaining the relevant findings. Subsequently, the paper removes this assumption of closedness and recontextualizes the results through the concept of parameterized naturality.
