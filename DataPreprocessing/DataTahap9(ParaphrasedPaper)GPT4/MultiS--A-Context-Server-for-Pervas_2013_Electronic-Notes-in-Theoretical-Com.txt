Context-aware applications dynamically adapt to changing environments by going through a three-stage process: monitoring the environment via sensors, recognizing the context from the sensor data, and adapting behavior accordingly. "Multis," a context server proposed in the referenced paper, aims to improve the context recognition stage and offers several benefits, including the generation of new contextual data from a variety of sources.

Ubiquitous computing, also known as pervasive computing, envisions a future where computing is integrated into the environment, becoming unobtrusive to users. This concept, first introduced by Mark Weiser and later adopted by IBM, includes both wired and wireless devices forming a network that provides services to users based on available resources.

ISAM authors suggest an infrastructure divided into cells of wired and wireless nodes, which communicate using peer-to-peer protocols. Applications are developed using ISAM adapt abstractions and executed in the EXEHA environment. This study contributes to ISAM by proposing a context-recognition engine for pervasive applications.

One of the significant challenges in computer science is to build scalable ubiquitous systems, where context-aware computing plays a crucial role.

To optimize the use of system resources, the paper discusses supporting middleware with a context server approach, allowing multiple applications to share common data while also meeting their specific environmental needs.

The paper outlines "Multis," a context server for pervasive computing, and details its architecture, including the monitoring system, filter repository, CD-XML language for defining how data is processed, and the adaptation process tied to changes in sensor data.

"Multis" employs either a monitoring system that detects and warns about sensor changes or periodically checks sensors to trigger the context-recognition process. The system is designed to accommodate disconnect events and shares contextual information across applications through a publish/subscribe mechanism.

In testing with a Java-based "Multis" prototype, performance degradation was observed when simultaneously executing many applications, highlighting potential limits to scalability.

Comparisons are made with other related works, including Solar, Context Toolkit, Aura/CIS, and JCAF, each with their strengths and limitations in sharing contextual information and responding to changes.

Overall, "Multis" demonstrates independence between application code and context treatment, providing a flexible and efficient context-aware computing framework through its CD-XML language, publish/subscribe mechanism, and shared filters. This addresses challenges in the context-aware application development process by simplifying the integration of information from various sources and managing disconnections, thus reducing development costs and fostering the creation of such applications.
