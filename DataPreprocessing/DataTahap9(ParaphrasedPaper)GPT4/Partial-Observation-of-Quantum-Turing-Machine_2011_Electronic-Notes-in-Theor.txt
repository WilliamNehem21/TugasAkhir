The academic paper discusses the dynamics of quantum Turing machines (QTMs), highlighting that they evolve in a unitary fashion, which typically prevents the observation of their state prior to the completion of their computation. To address the problem of determining whether a QTM has halted or not during its computation, it was shown that a halt qubit can be introduced. This halt qubit changes from 0 to 1 when the QTM halts and can be measured after each transitional step the QTM takes, allowing observers to monitor the machine's state during its operation.

The paper further introduces a general framework that allows for the partial observation of the QTM's state before and after each transitional step. This framework describes QTMs under different scenarios based on a division of the machine's internal states into partitions. The behavior of a QTM can vary according to how the internal states are partitioned, which in turn affects both how the machine operates (its evolution) and the set of problems (language) it is capable of recognizing, as well as its computational efficiency (execution time).

One key finding is articulated in Proposition 5.1: if the partition consists of a single group (i.e., no actual partitioning of states), the evolution of the original QTM and the observed QTM will be identical. However, when considering a specific case where the states are split into two groups (a bipartition), as described in Lemma 5.2, it is possible to have a scenario where the observed QTM experiences a different evolution than the original QTM. Despite this difference in how they operate, the computational capabilities of both the original QTM and the observed version remain equivalent in this particular example. This insight has implications for understanding how observations and measurements can influence the computation of QTMs while preserving their computational power.
