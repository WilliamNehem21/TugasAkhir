This academic paper explores the effectiveness of nine decision tree algorithms in processing microarray images for cancer classification, where gene samples are typically fewer than 200. It specifically compares these algorithms for classifying acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

The study outlines the unique challenges in gene classification, such as small sample sizes versus the vast number of genes, few relevant attributes, noise in data, and the dual need for accuracy and biological relevancy. Major public data repositories like the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and ArrayExpress provide extensive gene expression samples, but their size and diversity pose challenges for standard benchmarking.

Among the decision tree methods analyzed, some construct single trees, such as C4.5, CART, REPTree, RandomTree, and DecisionStump, while others, like ADTree, Random Forests, Bagging, and AdaBoost, create an ensemble of trees. Techniques like the bootstrap method are employed for resampling data to improve prediction accuracy.

The study utilizes the Weka 3.7.1 machine learning environment for all experiments and includes attribute selection methods to refine the gene sets used for model evaluation. The performance of the classifiers is assessed using the Area Under the Curve (AUC) metric and 10-fold cross-validation.

Experimental results indicate that ensemble methods significantly enhance the accuracy of single decision trees due to their voting mechanisms. AdaBoost, when coupled with C4.5, is particularly accurate without attribute selection, and various attribute selection techniques yield different results for other methods.

In summary, the study reveals that ensemble methods can improve classification accuracy, that attribute selection can influence the performance, and that AdaBoost and Bagging paired with different base classifiers have varying levels of success depending on the attribute selection method used.
