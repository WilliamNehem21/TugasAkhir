The original text you've provided outlines the role of Inflow Control Devices (ICDs) in enhancing oil recovery by mitigating issues such as water and gas coning and by optimizing production profiles across oil and gas wells. It also touches on the complexities of assessing the factors that influence horizontal well productivity when using ICDs due to their inherent uncertainty and imprecision.

To address this, the paper proposes the use of a fuzzy mathematical approach, leveraging the theory of fuzzy sets to deal with the ambiguity and provide a more accurate quantitative evaluation of these factors. Critical aspects of building an optimized assessment model with fuzzy mathematics include identifying the right factors to evaluate (evaluation index factors), their respective weights (index weights), and the creation of a subordinate function matrix to determine the appropriateness of ICDs for a particular situation, leading to the establishment of a fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model.

The effectiveness of ICDs in different scenarios is measured using the concept of relative fitness, denoted by rij, which ranges between 0 and 1. The greater the rij value is, the more suitable the ICD completion for the case at hand. A matrix composed of rij values provides a composite measure of the suitability of ICD completion across various cases.
