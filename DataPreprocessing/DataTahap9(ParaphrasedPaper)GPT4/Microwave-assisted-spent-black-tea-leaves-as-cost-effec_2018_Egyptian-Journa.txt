About 70% of synthetic dyes used in the textile industry across the globe are azo dyes, which are characterized by one or more azo groups (-N=N-) that serve as color-giving chromophores. Azo dyes, being the most abundant synthetic dyes group, are notoriously difficult to break down even at minimal concentrations. They have a resistance to degradation by light, heat, chemicals, and microorganisms. Consequently, it has become crucial to eliminate these dyes from industrial wastewater before discharging it into aquatic environments.

Efforts to remove dyes from wastewater include methods such as photocatalytic degradation, the photo-Fenton reaction, biodegradation, solvent extraction, coagulation, precipitation, membrane filtration, and advanced oxidation processes. Despite achieving notable results, these methods are not without drawbacks, including the extensive preparation involved and complex operational protocols. Additionally, secondary pollution can arise from photocatalytic degradation and other oxidative methods, resulting in byproducts that may be more toxic than the original compounds.

In contrast, adsorption techniques are simpler, easier to handle, and scalable for industrial applications. Various adsorbents have been used to extract Eriochrome Black T (EBT) from water, including magnetite/pectin and magnetite/silica/pectin hybrid nanocomposites, activated carbon, anionic layered double hydroxides, and NiFe2O4 magnetic nanoparticles. However, these materials are often expensive and challenging to produce, prompting researchers to develop more cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternatives.

To characterize the material (MASTL), several analytical techniques were used. They included Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) performed on a FEI Quanta 200 FEG SEM at 15 keV. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) was conducted on a Nicolet Magna-IR 750 spectrometer at room temperature. The absorption characteristics were measured using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) isotherm with a TriStar adsorption instrument from Micromeritics Company, USA. The point of zero charge (pH_PZC) for the material was established using a previously reported method.
