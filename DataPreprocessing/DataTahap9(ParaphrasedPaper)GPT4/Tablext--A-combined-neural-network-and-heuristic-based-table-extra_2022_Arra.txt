The paper presents a method for differentiating between cell groupings in an image by determining which inferred lines are best for splitting the cells. To achieve this, a Simple Moving Average (SMA) is used to average quality scores across lines, helping to mitigate noise and correct for cases where an inferred line could incorrectly divide characters within the data.

The proposed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) provides probabilities regarding whether two cells are merged and whether any of those cells are empty. This helps to avoid needless Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on empty cells, thus improving performance due to the time-consuming nature of OCR. The paper also details the CNN's implementation, training data, and how data is handled after processing by the CNN.

A key component of the system is a network branch tasked solely with identifying incorrect cell splits. This branch relies on more sophisticated neural network layers, highlighting the significance of the information provided by the pixels at and around the cell merge points. With five convolutional layers, the network can indicate whether cells contain data or should be merged. Dropout layers prevent over-reliance on a single branch and help guard against overfitting, given the limited training data.
