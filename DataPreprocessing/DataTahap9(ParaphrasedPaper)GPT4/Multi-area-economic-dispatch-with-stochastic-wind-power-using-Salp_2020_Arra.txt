Optimization techniques based on swarm intelligence are highly effective and have become widespread. These methods draw inspiration from natural behaviors to solve complex problems through strategies like self-organization and task allocation. Examples include Particle Swarm Optimization, which is inspired by social behaviors of fish and birds, Artificial Bee Colony Optimization, which mimics honeybee foraging, Whale Optimization Algorithm based on humpback whale strategies, Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm, Spider Monkey Optimization reflecting spider monkeys' society, Grey Wolf Optimizer which emulates hunting patterns of grey wolves, and the Teaching-Learning Based Optimization that represents influence dynamics in a classroom setting.

This paper introduces the Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA), a novelty in bio-inspired optimization that looks at the navigational patterns of salp chains in deep seas. The algorithm separates the salp population into leaders and followers, where the "best" salp, that corresponds to the best-known solution thus far, acts as the point of attraction for the rest. With each iteration, the leader adjusts its position relative to this optimal food source ("best solution"), exploring and exploiting the solution space, while follower salps adaptively align themselves in the chain. 

To assess the SSA's efficiency, it is applied to the Multi-Area Economic Dispatch (MAED) problems with varying dimensions and complexities, involving nonlinear, multimodal, non-convex, and probabilistic challenges introduced by wind power integration. The simulations, run in MATLAB on common hardware, show that SSA outperforms several other metaheuristics, obtaining lower costs in large-scale problem instances. For example, in a case with a wind-thermal network and 40 generators, SSA achieved a lower operational cost than other algorithms, emphasizing its superior global search capabilities.

The paper is organized with Section 2 detailing the problem formulation, tying together MAED, wind power modeling, and the related constraints. Section 3 discusses SSA, its behavior, and its deployment for solving MAED issues. Section 4 lays out the test case scenarios, control impacts, simulation outcomes, and analyses, with conclusions drawn in Section 5. The results affirm that SSA is a promising tool for optimizing complex power systems, offering remarkable cost-efficiency and operational consistency in the face of the uncertain, dynamic nature of wind energy.
