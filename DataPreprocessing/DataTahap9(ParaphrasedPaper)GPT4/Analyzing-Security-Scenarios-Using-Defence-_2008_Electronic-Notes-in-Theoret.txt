This paper presents an advanced method for improving security through the strategic selection and prioritization of countermeasures against potential cyber-attacks. It introduces cp-defence trees, which integrate conditional preferences to better evaluate and manage security options. To facilitate decision-making, the authors transform these cp-defence trees into an Answer Set Optimization (ASO) program that handles preferences among attacks and countermeasures. The ASO program forms a structured model representing different security scenarios through a combination of conditional branches of the cp-defence tree.

The technique allows modeling the relationship between attacks and countermeasures using ASO, where preferences are organized hierarchically. By syntactically merging individual ASO programs from the defence tree's branches, the researchers achieve a comprehensive model that respects the initial intent and presents sets of prioritized countermeasures.

To address different levels of threat severity, the model incorporates rankings that guide the selection of countermeasures, giving priority to those mitigating the most serious attacks and mitigating cyclic preference issues. A new ordering methodology is developed to compare and prioritize sets of countermeasures, based on defined permutation conditions.

The paper highlights the advantages of the ASO approach for modeling cp-defence trees, such as its capacity to handle complex preference structures and resolve conflicts that may have been challenging with previous methods. The authors also compare ASO programming with CR-Prolog, another knowledge representation language. They prefer ASO for its ability to define preference orders not just among rules but also among individual elements.

Overall, the study demonstrates the proposed method's effectiveness in managing security risks using a small real-world example and suggests that ASO programming is a suitable tool for optimizing defence strategies in complex cyber-security environments.
