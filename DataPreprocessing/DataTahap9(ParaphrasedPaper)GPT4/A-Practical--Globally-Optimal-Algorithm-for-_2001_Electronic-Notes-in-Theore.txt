The recognition by alignment process involves iteratively matching subsets of a model's features to an image's features. The subsets are as small as possible while still allowing for the unique determination of a geometric transformation. The calculated transformation from these matches won't necessarily yield the highest overall feature correspondence because it's estimated from inexact location data, making the method an approximate solution for geometric matching.

The Hough transform simplifies pose clustering by categorizing transformation parameters into bins. Despite being fast and relatively accurate with adjustments, this method inaccurately captures location errors and does not restrict model features from matching multiple image features, potentially leading to both false positives and false negatives.

Inputs to the algorithm include a data-independent portion—a function for computing the transformation and another for assessing the match quality for a single pair of features—and a data-dependent portion consisting of the feature coordinates.

To characterize the algorithm's effectiveness and complexity, we must comprehend the transformation space's geometry. Although this paper does not conduct a full complexity analysis, it offers an understanding of the geometry involved and how it may affect complexity. For further details, the reader is advised to consult related geometric matching and computational geometry literature. With m model features and n image features, there are mn potential pairings. Taking one feature from the model and one from the image, the match function can be analyzed as a variable of the transformation.

A detailed average case analysis is not included here due to the challenge of statistically analyzing geometric arrangements. Practical viability of the algorithm is shown through actual performance tests. Another source provides an informal average case analysis of a related issue, suggesting that the computational complexity of rasterization (RAST) algorithms is on par with that of alignment methods.
