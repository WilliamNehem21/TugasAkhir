This study addresses the challenge of managing irrigation efficiently in urban landscapes within arid and semi-arid regions, where accurate reference evapotranspiration (ETo) estimation is of great importance. Due to a lack of comprehensive climatic data, which hampers the use of the standard Penman-Monteith method for ETo computation, the research explores the possibility of employing deep learning models to develop temperature-based ETo estimations suitable for smart irrigation controllers. 

The research compares the performance of deep learning ETo models against traditional empirical temperature-based models such as the FAO Blaney & Criddle (BC) and Hargreaves & Samani (HS) methods. Additionally, the study introduces DeepET, a user-friendly tool based on the highest-performing deep learning models from the research, enabling easier access to ETo predictions.

Investigative efforts yielded four different artificial neural network (ANN) models, leveraging both raw weather data and data processed with wavelet transform. Moreover, the study developed Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models. The research incorporated data from 101 active California Irrigation Management Information System (CIMIS) weather stations.

Analysis considered seven climate divisions of California using spatial data sourced from the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC-NOAA). The spatial distribution of stations predominantly fell within arid (48 stations) and semi-arid (39 stations) climates, with a minority in hyper-arid, dry sub-humid, and humid categories.

The research acknowledges that when full input data is accessible, the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith model remains the recommended standard for ETo estimation. However, the intent of this study was to construct and assess deep learning models based chiefly on temperature-dependent parameters. The study also includes deep learning models considering extra variables like relative humidity and wind speed to examine their top performance potential.

For the development of deep learning models, the Kingma and Ba (2015) method was used to train the models and their optimal parameters were determined through testing. The ANN models were designed with the TensorFlow library, considering two variable input combinations, resulting in four deep learning models. Each model differed, with one incorporating inputs such as minimum temperature (Tmin), maximum temperature (Tmax), average temperature (Ta), relative humidity (RH), wind speed (U), and extraterrestrial solar radiation (Ra), while the other model excluded RH and U.

The study notes that the HS model could be considered a purely temperature-based model as extraterrestrial solar radiation can be calculated based on location and time. Previous machine learning research has suggested that global solar radiation is more significant than RH and wind speed when estimating daily ETo. Moreover, the HS model's temperature differential serves as an indirect measure of cloud cover and RH, where clear skies usually mean higher daytime maximum temperatures and lower nighttime minimums, and cloudy days are associated with lower daytime highs and higher nighttime lows.
