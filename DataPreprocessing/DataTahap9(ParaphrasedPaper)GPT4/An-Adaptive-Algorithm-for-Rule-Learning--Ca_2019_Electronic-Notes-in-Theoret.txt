Machine learning involves the development of computer programs that improve their performance with experience. Similarly, pattern recognition entails the automatic detection of patterns in data using computer algorithms, which can then be used for decision-making actions, such as classifying data. An established method of classification in machine learning is rule extraction, where algorithms create if-then rule-based classifiers. These classifiers have a predictive performance on par with other traditional methods such as decision trees and associative classification.

A particular method for rule classification, known as rule induction, uses an iterative approach that selects a subset of training examples to generate a rule, then removes those examples from the training set. This process is repeated until no more examples are left. The end result is a collection of iterative rules, comprising the rule set. The PRISM algorithm is an example of rule induction, using a separate-and-conquer strategy and generating rules based on class labels.

Adaptive technologies involve tools and methods that change their behavior in response to inputs, essentially enabling machines to learn and adapt to perform tasks better. Learning systems can be adjusted dynamically using adaptive techniques, which is seen as a key aspect of learning: the ability to evolve based on environmental interactions. Adaptive methods often offer more expressive power than traditional learning techniques.

Adaptive technology has been beneficial in machine learning and pattern recognition. For example, Pistori and Neto developed a decision tree induction algorithm that employs adaptive techniques, blending syntactic and statistical strategies. Adaptive automata have been used for various applications like sign language recognition, shape pattern recognition, and robotic navigation. Other uses include skin cancer detection and optical character recognition.

According to Mitchell, the "learn-one-rule" process should generate a rule that covers some of the training examples. Rule performance is measured using a user-defined subroutine. Rule learning continues until no new rules exceeding the performance threshold are found. Common metrics are used for evaluation.

Adaptive functions are abstract actions within adaptive systems, analogous to function calls in programming. They consist of elements like a symbolic name, formal parameters for arguments, variables, generators for new value references, and the function's body.

The algorithm ranks rules based on their accuracy and applies them from highest-ranked to lowest. In cases where rules have equal performance, those with fewer terms are preferred. To manage large datasets, a heuristic-based approach might be employed to reduce the number of candidate rules. Handling numerical attributes and noisy datasets, which may contain incomplete attributes and missing values, requires strategies for data discretization and prediction of missing information to improve model convergence.
