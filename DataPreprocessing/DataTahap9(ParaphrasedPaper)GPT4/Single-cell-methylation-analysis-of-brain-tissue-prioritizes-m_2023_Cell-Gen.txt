In our study comparing two inbred mouse strains, we investigated the relationship between CpG methylation and gene expression. Generally, CpG methylation represses transcription, so we hypothesized that mutations removing methylated CpG sites would increase transcript levels, which proved true. Notably, the influence of mutations on gene expression was connected to CpG density: high-density regions showed significant effects of mutations on transcript abundance, albeit small (less than 1%), while low-density regions did not show a significant impact despite analysis of many sites. Additionally, mutations in high-density CpG regions were more frequent in enhancer-associated chromatin states.

In terms of assessing the total number of candidate variants affecting transcription, when looking at specific loci related to behavioral traits, the numbers are manageable, with about three candidates within a 5-Mb region from comparisons between B6 and D2 mouse strains, not accounting for the non-uniform variant distribution in the mouse genome.

Our study had some limitations. One was the focus on a limited set of cell types with high methylation coverage, which might not represent other cell types. Another concern is the potential oversight of certain cell types, which could distort our analysis if mutations have cell-type-specific methylation effects. Moreover, our research was confined to CpG sites in the hippocampus. Mutations at non-CpG methylation sites or in other brain areas might exhibit different behaviors.

For quality control and preprocessing, we utilized the Seurat package. We excluded cells from our biological samples if they fell below stringent criteria for RNA UMI counts and unique gene expression or exceeded these thresholds, as well as if cells had more than 5% mitochondrial-derived reads.
