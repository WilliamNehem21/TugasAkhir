The academic paper discusses the relative scarcity of visual tools for graphically representing problems and the progress of proof searches in automated deduction, unlike the richer tradition of such tools existing within the constraint programming (CP) community. These visual tools assist programmers and users in understanding problems, search processes, and solutions.

While the paper acknowledges that visualization could be beneficial for interactive theorem proving (ITP), it leaves the topic aside to focus on automated theorem provers, which operate differently from ITP.

Within this context, the paper examines if visualization concepts and tools from CP platforms can be modified for use with automated theorem provers. One example provided is of a railway tracking problem involving moving trains between sectors, which can be represented as a constraint graph, showing relationships between different parts of a problem.

The constraint graph abstracts constraints without specifying content but indicates which problem areas are interrelated. During searches, this graph can be animated to show variable assignments and domain reductions, aiding programmers in understanding the impacts of heuristics and constraints.

The paper also mentions a visual metaphor used by the G12 Constraint Graph Viewer (G12-CGV). This uses force-directed layouts to visualize the graph in 2D to avoid overlap, although 3D representations can be more complex and harder to use despite being aesthetically pleasing.

Moreover, constraint programming tools typically display search trees, which can be adapted to visualize more nuanced searching methods like SAT solvers' backjumping and local search strategies, yet visualizing these methods remains a challenge.

In the realm of theorem proving, function and predicate symbols used in a languageâ€™s logic correspond to decision variables in CP, with their domains being the quantification domains in the intended interpretation of the proof problem.

However, not all problems align with constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs); some differ significantly, with instances involving infinite domains like the Herbrand universe. Even with these differences, constraint graphs can still be drawn by interpreting language over finite domains to reveal underlying structure helpful in domain-specific proof searches.

Displaying the graph of derived formulae remains an open question due to the vast number of these formulae requiring some form of abstraction to be viable for visualization. Ideas include displaying formula quantities at each proof depth and allowing users to zoom in on specifics, although details on its implementation are not provided.

The paper concludes by emphasizing the importance of visualization tools in the debugging of problem encodings and parameter settings. These tools help achieve the right level of abstraction, intuitively highlighting essential features, a notable improvement over traditional methods that either offer too broad or too detailed information in theorem proving.

In summary, the paper identifies opportunities and challenges in adapting CP visualization techniques for automated theorem proving, offering insights into the current state of visualization in this area and potential directions for improving the understanding and debugging of proof problems through visual tools.
