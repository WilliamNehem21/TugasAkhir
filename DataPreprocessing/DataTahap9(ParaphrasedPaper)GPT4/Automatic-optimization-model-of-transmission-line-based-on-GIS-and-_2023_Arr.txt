This paper discusses challenges in transmission line planning, traditionally dependent on human decision-making, lacking automation and intelligence. It proposes integrating Geographic Information System (GIS) capabilities with a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to enhance the optimization of transmission line planning, reducing human bias and improving efficiency.

Genetic algorithms, inspired by natural evolution, can quickly find superior solutions for complex optimization problems and are thus applied to transmission line planning. The study develops a GA-based optimization model for transmission line planning and implements it as a plug-in using C# language, compatible with a 500 kV overhead transmission scenario.

The model considers various environmental and social factors, recognizing that the shortest path is not always the most practical due to variables such as terrain, bodies of water, protected areas, climate, seismic activity, transportation, land use, and regional plans. These factors influence both the path planning complexity and the construction cost of transmission lines.

Experiments compare the planning outcomes of two scenarios, one emphasizing only the cost of transportation and the other accounting for multiple factors. The results show that the GA-optimized path is superior when various parameters are considered.

In planning, the area is divided into grids, and influencing factors are quantified as costs that populate each grid. A knowledge-based genetic operator representing these "cost genes" is proposed, using floating-point coding to handle decision variables with complex constraints effectively.

The study seeks to minimize the total cost of the line, where the fitness function is based on the lowest cumulative grid cost along the planned line. The method retains strong solutions and encourages diversity within the population for more effective evolution.

By setting the grid resolution to 150 m, the algorithm strikes a balance between computational efficiency and detail retention. The study emphasizes the need for a comprehensive evaluation system that incorporates multiple factors for more realistic outcomes, moving away from simplistic, single-factor models.

Ultimately, the paper introduces a tailored GA-based transmission line optimization model, using floating-point coding for genetic operations and considering multiple influences to guide the optimization process. The add-ins plug-in developed in C# facilitates integrating this approach with existing GIS tools.
