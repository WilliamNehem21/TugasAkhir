Invariant-based programming is a method where a programmer first outlines potential scenarios such as preconditions, postconditions, and invariants for an algorithm before any coding starts. Following this initial step, the coder maps out how these scenarios transition between one another, establishing the algorithm's control flow. This approach ensures a program's correctness is baked into its construction.

In such frameworks, the primary focus isn't on structured control flows but on ensuring the program transitions correctly maintain the defined constraints. These programs can start and finish at various points, making them inherently multi-entry and multi-exit in nature.

For teaching purposes, this method has shown promise, aiding students in understanding how to build correct programs from scratch and allowing them to appreciate the logical structure underlying program operation.

The paper then explores the concept of data refinement, where programmers develop correct software by gradually transitioning from high-level, abstract data designs to more detailed, concrete structures. This process reduces the complexity of proofs of correctness. The authors apply this to the construction of the Deutsch-Schorr-Waite graph marking algorithm and validate their results using the Isabelle/HOL theorem prover.

The paper details the development process of invariant-based programs, provides instruction on data refinement of invariant diagrams, and concludes with the practical construction of the Deutsch-Schorr-Waite algorithm. The authors emphasize the advantages of their approach, such as decreased proof complexity and a solid foundation for correctness, backed up by mechanical proofs in Isabelle/HOL. Future work aims to integrate data refinement techniques into the SOCoS environment, intended to support the development and verification of invariant-based programs.
