In the discussed paper, the authors introduce a versatile platform called CALIFE designed to facilitate the integration of various tools that operate on automata. This platform supports multiple automata models, including transition systems, timed automata, and counter automata, among others. The platform is also flexible enough to accommodate new model definitions and the integration of additional tools. At the time of the paper, a range of tools including UPPAAL, HyTech, Kronos, CMC, and Coq, have been successfully connected to CALIFE. Moreover, a unified representation of a timed-automata system constructed within the CALIFE system editor has the capability to be exported seamlessly to all the aforementioned interfaced tools.
