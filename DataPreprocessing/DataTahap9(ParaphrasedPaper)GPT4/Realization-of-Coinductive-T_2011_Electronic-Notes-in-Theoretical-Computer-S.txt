In this research, the authors provide a detailed combinatorial method for creating ultimate coalgebras for a slightly extended version of polynomial functors defined on the category of sets. Rather than characterizing type signatures through endofunctors, the approach utilizes directed multigraphs.

Here, a type signature is represented via a directed multigraph, denoted by 'f', where each node within the multigraph is classified as either existential or universal. These existential nodes are linked to the notion of coproducts (sum types), and universal nodes to products (product types), reflecting the basic operations for building data types. The directed edges of the multigraph are indicative of the various destructors, which define how the composite data types can be deconstructed into simpler components.

The concept of a final coalgebra associated with a given type signature 'f' incorporates the idea of the Brzozowski derivative, which in this context is applied to sets of paths within the multigraph 'f'. The Brzozowski derivative is a tool for analyzing automata and formal languages, but here it is adapted to handle paths in a graph, supporting the construction of the final coalgebra which describes the behavior of the described data types.
