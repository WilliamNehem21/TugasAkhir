This academic paper introduces a concept in architectural design called Architectural Design Rewriting (ADR), which treats the design process algebraically. In ADR, architectures are essentially graphs that show components and their connections, typed by interfaces that determine how they can be joined to form larger structures. The "operators" in this algebra are also graphs but contain placeholders (variables) that can be replaced by actual components (values) while ensuring that interface constraints are met.

The paper presents a new variation of ADR called Hierarchical Design Rewriting (HDR), which introduces hierarchical graphs to the design process. Unlike previous ADR work, which only considered flat graphs, HDR permits the embedding of nested graphs within other graphs. HDR also uses symbolic operators that keep certain parts of the architecture abstract until later design stages, facilitating the representation of incomplete architecture information in a visually intuitive way.

The structure of the paper is as follows:

1. Section 2 discusses ADR and the concept of partial architectural information.
2. Section 3 describes the implementation of graph structures in HDR.
3. Section 4 explains how to write HDR specifications.
4. Section 5 presents methods for analyzing HDR prototypes, including custom and built-in strategies, as well as using Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) model checking.
5. Section 6 concludes the paper and outlines future research directions.

The paper categorizes edges in the graph into terminals (basic, concrete components) and non-terminals (complex, abstract components). Partial designs are those with non-terminal edges. It's a common scenario for service-oriented applications, where an architecture becomes concrete only after a selection and binding process. The paper investigates two abstraction levels in ADR: initial symbolic algebra (with non-terminals as sorts) and fully evaluated algebra (with concrete designs and their interfaces).

Lastly, the paper emphasizes that the ADR framework, supported by the Maude system (a software tool for formal modeling and analysis), is not just theoretical but also practical for designing and analyzing software architectures. Example Maude code snippets are provided to illustrate the concepts, and the full specifications can be downloaded for deeper examination. The paper indicates that ADR can be a viable tool in the development and analysis of software systems, supported by the rewriting logic formalism used by Maude, and hints at prior success using Maude in related fields of software architecture modeling and verification.
