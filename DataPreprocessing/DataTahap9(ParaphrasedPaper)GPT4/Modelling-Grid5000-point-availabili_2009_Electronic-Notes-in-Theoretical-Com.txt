The paper discusses the challenge of measuring the likelihood that a computing grid—comprised of numerous resources—remains functional at a given time (point availability). Its key argument is that the complexity of computing grids makes traditional modeling approaches difficult. The authors propose a component-based framework and tensor numerical treatments to better analyze system availability, particularly when maintenance or time evolution is considered.

While calculating long-term (or "steady-state") availability is manageable due to advanced numerical techniques, point availability poses more challenges due to the potential size of the underlying Markov chain required for analysis and the numerous iterations needed for computation.

The authors highlight Stochastic Automata Networks (SAN) as a high-level formalism effective in simplifying the state space issue through the use of tensors instead of sparse matrices. SAN models grid systems in a structured way, breaking them down into subsystems that behave independently but might occasionally interact. Interactions can be single automaton (local events) or multiple automata (synchronizing events).

Moreover, the rate of an event's occurrence in SAN can be a fixed value or a function influenced by other automata states, allowing for one-way interaction within the system.

The paper proposes modeling a grid platform using only two types of automata—one representing grid sites (Site Automaton) and the other representing connections between sites (Link Automaton). This method can capture various repair behaviors and complex interdependencies within the grid.

The paper applies SAN to demonstrate the modeling of a grid platform's repair and failure rates. It also discusses how to simplify the model by combining sites and connections (thus reducing the complexity of the grid representation) and by grouping processors in blocks, acknowledging that hardware is often clustered within physical machines.

In summary, the authors suggest that tensor-based solutions and SAN modeling provide efficient alternative methods for evaluating point availability in large, complex grid computing systems, allowing for a more manageable analysis of system stability and functioning.
