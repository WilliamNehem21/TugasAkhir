In the research paper, the authors explore different semantics for representing models in Stochastic Concurrent Constraint Programming (SCCP) and their impact on model behavior and robustness. Specifically, they compare hybrid automata (HA), stochastic, and differential semantics in the context of biological systems. The focus is on two biological systems, the repressilator and a simplified circadian clock model, examining how introducing discreteness can affect the stability of oscillations and overall robustness of the models.

SCCP is an extension of Concurrent Constraint Programming (CCP) that integrates stochasticity, where agents interact by sharing constraints in a common store. The paper provides an introduction to SCCP, and further details are available in referenced works.

Hybrid automata combine discrete and continuous dynamics, with variables changing due to both continuous evolution and instantaneous discrete events. They can produce different traces from the same initial conditions, making them non-deterministic. A hybrid automaton is defined by a set of components, like variables, events, and rules for continuous and discrete changes.

For the repressilator, three template processes that represent gene expression and repression are coded in SCCP with parameters for production rate, binding/unbinding rates, and degradation rate.

In the case of the circadian clock, the introduction of discreteness stabilizes the model, with stochasticity providing additional stabilization due to the inherent variability in the system.

The authors find that a limited amount of discreteness can improve model robustness without significantly increasing computational costs compared to ordinary differential equation (ODE) integrations. They also suggest that the mapping from SCCP to HA can allow variability in the degree of discreteness, forming a lattice of hybrid automata with different levels of discreteness. By analyzing these lattices, they aim to identify key transitions that affect robustness and to explore how the satisfiability of temporal formulas, which express dynamic properties, varies across the lattice.

The paper also ties their approach to hybrid simulation algorithms for multiscale systems, proposing that their framework could offer new insights into these methods. Overall, the authors seek to understand how different model semantics in SCCP can influence the dynamics and robustness of complex systems such as biological networks.
