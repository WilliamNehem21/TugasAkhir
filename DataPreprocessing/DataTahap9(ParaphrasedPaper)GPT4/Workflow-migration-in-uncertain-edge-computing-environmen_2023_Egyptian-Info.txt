Numerous studies in Edge Computing (EC) have been conducted to create optimization models that address computational problems with the goal of minimizing factors such as delay, energy use, and cost. However, these studies tend to focus on a single optimization goal or simplify multi-objective problems by assigning subjective weights, which can introduce inaccuracies. Real-world task computation must account for the varying requirements of users and the trade-offs between multiple objectives.

The paper's structure is as follows: Section 2 discusses related works. Section 3 describes the construction of the I-MAOWMUE model. Section 4 introduces the MI-MAOEA method designed to address the I-MAOWMUE model. Section 5 involves conducting simulation experiments with the results summarized and analyzed. Section 6 provides a summary and draws conclusions from the study.

In particular, this paper examines the scenario of computational migration in the context of user movement, where multiple mobile devices (MDs) are within range of several base stations (BSs). When users move, incomplete tasks must be reassigned to different servers based on the current status of the system. The paper introduces the I-MAOWMUE model that considers dependent task computation in the presence of uncertainties like network bandwidth and server processing capabilities. This model aims to optimize migration delay, completion time, energy consumption, and load balancing. Additionally, a real-time priority scheduling policy is developed to manage resources efficiently and ensure swift task processing. To solve the I-MAOWMUE model, the paper proposes the MI-MAOEA algorithm, which addresses the issue of uncertainty and ensures that a diverse range of potential solutions is generated and maintained throughout the computation process.
