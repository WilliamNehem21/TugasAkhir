The paper discusses a workflow scheduling algorithm that achieved a 70% improvement in algorithm performance and a 10% increase in processor utilization compared to the HEFT (Heterogeneous Earliest Finish Time) and Triplet algorithms. A mentioned approach, the Hybrid Cloud Optimized Cost (HCOC) scheduling algorithm, aims to minimize costs by effectively determining which resources to lease from a public cloud and add to a private cloud, all while adhering to a specified execution deadline. This HCOC algorithm is designed to balance cost savings with maintaining execution times below deadlines.

The paper also reports a significant increase in resource utilization and energy efficiency in settings where resource contention is common. The authors conducted an in-depth review of workflow scheduling algorithms, proposing a classification system for them, as well as offering significant insights into their use. A method for workflow scheduling is introduced that involves three key phases: finding a balance between minimal timeline extension (makespan) and maximal resource usage reduction; task and resource consolidation; and improving resource efficiency. Experiments with real-world workflows supported the effectiveness of the method, showing a 54% reduction in resources used, with less than a 10% increase in makespan on average.

The paper further explores the unique aspects and classifications of workflow scheduling in the cloud, dividing them into scheduling process, task, and resource categories. It proposes a taxonomy that can guide new researchers and advance scheduling technique development. This new framework enhances grid workflow scheduling taxonomies by incorporating new elements unique to cloud computing and refining existing ones. It notes that current techniques generally assume the use of virtual machine instances or Infrastructure-as-a-Service.

The authors point out that while the majority of the scheduling research seeks to reduce makespan, enhance resource utilization, and cut costs, they often neglect a hybrid approach to scheduling techniques. They present a mathematical approach to improve scheduling algorithm performance without resorting to conventional modifications.

HEFT, widely used in various significant projects, takes a global scheduling approach without fully considering all ready queue tasks, which can be problematic in resource-rich environments. HEFT assigns tasks to virtual machines (VMs) based on ranks but does not use any suitability criteria for this mapping, leading to potential inefficiencies in resource utilization.

The paper introduces a hybrid planning algorithm that improves upon HEFT's limitations. DHEFT uses a distributed approach without rank computation, focusing on the earliest finish time, resulting in improved makespan. RHEFT further refines the approximation of the ready queue. Utilization in RHEFT improved regarding both HEFT and DHEFT, and while it decreased with greater resource availability, the reduction was offset by better makespan results. RHEFT consistently used resources efficiently across various resource availability levels. Therefore, the authors concluded that the extension of RHEFT, which would better approximate the ready queue than the current version, is an area for future research.
