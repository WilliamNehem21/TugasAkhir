This document investigates the meaning of newly created identifiers within the framework of continuation-passing style (CPS). These new identifiers are crucial in numerous computational processes and inherently fascinating because they can symbolize confidential information like encryption keys. Understanding how these identifiers operate in a functional programming environment is complex, and to study this, researchers have used foundational models like the nu-calculus and applied various analytical methods, including operational and denotational approaches.
