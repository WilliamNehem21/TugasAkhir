In the academic paper, the authors discuss the benefits of integrating CSP (Communicating Sequential Processes) into the Event-B formalism to streamline the process of proving system refinements. In Event-B, refinement is an essential aspect where a more concrete model of a system is developed in stages from an abstract model. Each refinement stage requires proofs, known as proof obligations, to ensure correctness. With CSP's integration, control flow-related proof obligations are easier to manage, as checks for trace refinement and freedom from divergence can now be automated to a certain extent.

The paper also illuminates how events from a more abstract model (referred to as `mi`) are refined in a more concrete model (`mi+1`). This is achieved through a mapping `fi+1`, where events in `mi+1` refine the corresponding events in `mi`. Although the general Event-B framework allows for a many-to-one relationship in event refinement, the paper restricts this to a one-to-one relationship for simplicity.

A case study included in the paper demonstrates the use of CSP and Event-B in modeling the process of file transfer across an unreliable medium. While CSP is adept at handling the repetitive aspects of the sender and receiver operations, Event-B effectively captures the state-related aspects of the model. The focus here is on the lossy nature of the medium, disregarding the reliability of the acknowledgments.

Event-B provides an improved framework for articulating the flow of control within the events, particularly evident in scenarios involving timeouts and repeated data transmissions. Furthermore, this integration simplifies event descriptions within the Event-B machinery, as control variables traditionally used in event guards and assignments can be removed. Their roles have been taken over by the CSP controller. An example is provided where control bits at level 3 of the pure Event-B model, which used to manage the flow of control, become redundantâ€”simplifying the event description within the Event-B model.

Readers interested in the technical specifics of the approach are referred to other papers [9,8] by the authors. Meanwhile, this paper aims to showcase the types of refinements enabled by this integration and offers a practical demonstration of the methodology.
