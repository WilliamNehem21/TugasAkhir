This paper discusses the limitations of traditional conflict detection methods within graph transformation systems, acknowledging the inefficiency of current approaches that rely on the computation of all critical pairs. To address this, it introduces a novel concept known as 'essential critical pairs,' which reduces the computational complexities involved by focusing only on a necessary subset of critical pairs that uniquely and minimally represent each conflict.

Essential critical pairs are based on a newly defined conflict characterization that identifies the specific reason for each conflict that arises between the rules of a transformation system. The paper highlights that each conflict has a corresponding essential critical pair, ensuring both the completeness and uniqueness of conflict representation. This approach streamlines the conflict detection process, potentially leading to the development of a more efficient algorithm.

Initial findings promise that the set of essential critical pairs is smaller than the full set of all critical pairs, resulting in improved efficiency since fewer computations are needed for static conflict detection. Key contributions of the paper include a characterization of conflicts, demonstration of the uniqueness and completeness of essential critical pairs, and a local confluence lemma based on these essential critical pairs.

The paper concludes by suggesting that future work will focus on creating an efficient algorithm for constructing essential critical pairs and extend the new conflict detection theory to accommodate graph transformation systems with non-injective matches. Additionally, it sets an agenda for investigating new conflicts and critical pair concepts in graph transformation systems with application conditions, constraints, and in more complex scenarios involving typed and attributed graphs.
