The academic paper discusses the impact and development of the Agricultural Internet of Things (IoT), an advancement that is transforming agriculture by increasing productivity, improving product quality, reducing labor costs, enhancing farmer income, and helping achieve modern and intelligent farming.

The paper first outlines the current state of agricultural IoT, describing its architecture and the progression of sensor technology, highlighting innovations in the United States, Japan, and Germany. It then details five key technologies pivotal to agricultural IoT:

1. Sensor diversity - covering soil, meteorological, water, and plant sensors.
2. Information processing - employing cloud computing to manage the vast amounts of data generated from agricultural monitoring.
3. Remote sensing technology - a three-dimensional observation technique, highly effective in large area crop monitoring and management aid.
4. RFID and other location technologies - for precise identification and navigation, improving capabilities of sensing systems.
5. Further applications in livestock monitoring and wireless transmission using Zigbee protocol.

Subsequently, the paper addresses applications of agricultural IoT in five critical areas:
1. Planting & transplantation.
2. Pesticide spraying & terrain monitoring.
3. Soil analysis.
4. Plant nutrient and health monitoring.
5. Product warehousing, logistics, and distribution traceability.

It notes the issues in current agricultural IoT, such as the challenges of high-speed data transmission in remote areas and the need for efficient data coding. To address these, it suggests more research on system structure, node deployment, and management. The goal is for an open, distributed architecture with shared resources, ensuring diverse system interconnections and more granular agricultural information.

Finally, the paper provides a forecast for agricultural IoT's future development, implying ongoing research and improvement are critical to further advancement and efficient integration into modern agricultural practices.
