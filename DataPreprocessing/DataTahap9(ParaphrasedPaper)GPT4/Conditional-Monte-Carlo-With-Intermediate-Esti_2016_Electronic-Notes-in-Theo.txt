The article presents a new simulation method called Monte Carlo with Intermediate Estimations (CMIE), which aims to provide accurate reliability estimations for highly dependable Markovian systems. It introduces the concept of CMIE, establishes that it generates unbiased estimations, and demonstrates that it has lower variance compared to standard methods. An adaptation of CMIE for large, highly reliable multi-component systems is also presented. Through experimentation, CMIE's effectiveness is evidenced.

The discussion moves to comparing CMIE to other methods such as splitting and techniques based on importance sampling, highlighting its potential in handling rare events. Sections of the paper elaborate on CMIE's properties and how it can be effectively applied, particularly to Markovian multi-component systems. Notably, CMIE is contrasted with the splitting method and the circumstances under which they produce equivalent estimates.

Complications that arise from failure propagation in standard models are addressed, pointing out that CMIE remains unaffected by such issues. Empirical tests place CMIE on par with other methods concerning efficiency, variance, and precision gain. CMIE's variance is provided in a closed form, and it's suggested that the method could be applied to other types of rare event problems, including network reliability estimation under static or dynamic conditions. Future research directions are contemplated in the final section of the paper.
