This article presents LEMON, a versatile and open-source C++ library that offers user-friendly and efficient implementations of graph algorithms, network algorithms, and related data structures. LEMON is evaluated alongside similar software, including the Boost Graph Library (BGL) and the Library of Efficient Data types and Algorithms (LEDA), and is found to often outshine them in terms of performance.

LEMON aims to supply components that facilitate the resolution of intricate optimization problems encountered in real-world scenarios. It is cross-platform compatible, tested across multiple OS and compilers, and integrates easily with various IDEs, thanks to its CMake based build system.

The paper is organized to first compare LEMON’s main features with other similar libraries, followed by implementation details, performance benchmarks, future development plans, and finally, conclusions.

LEMON differentiates between undirected edges and directed arcs in graphs, simplifying the implementation of some algorithms, while also providing compatibility between edges and arcs for convenience. It introduces special iterators that do not conform to the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) concepts, designed to simplify their usage in the context of graph element traversal. 

In terms of data structures, LEMON utilizes external property maps that are independent but automatically update with changes in the graph. This design choice offers flexibility and can improve cache efficiency.

LEMON boasts efficient implementations of numerous graph-related algorithms, spanning from basic graph searches to complex optimization problems. The library interfaces with various linear programming solvers, and it has a custom file format for storing graphs and maps that balances versatility with performance and ease of processing.

The library's observer design pattern signals changes to graphs, allowing maps to automatically update. Maps are implemented for efficiency and strong exception safety, rolling back changes in the event of an exception during insertions.

Benchmark tests prove that LEMON’s fundamental algorithms and data structures typically offer superior speed compared to alternatives from BGL and LEDA, positioning it favorably for both academic research and practical development in the fields of combinatorial optimization and network design.

Future work for LEMON includes porting existing features from the older 0.x series and potentially capitalizing on new C++ language features to enhance the library's functionality without sacrificing performance.
