Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are being increasingly implemented in agricultural prediction tasks, demonstrating superior accuracy compared to traditional statistical models such as generalized linear models. Traditional models often necessitate data transformations to meet assumptions of normality and linearity, whereas machine learning approaches like random forests and artificial neural networks do not require these transformations. These advanced methods are capable of automatically identifying complex patterns, such as non-linear relationships and interactions between variables. The accessibility to online courses has made it easier for students and researchers to acquire machine learning skills, facilitating its adoption in research projects.

However, higher predictive performance is associated with increased algorithmic complexity, observed in methods like random forests, gradient boosting, and artificial neural networks. With greater complexity and the incorporation of regularization, predictability can be improved, yet this often leads to models that are less interpretable by humans. These "black box" models pose challenges in understanding the rationale behind predictions and identifying when and why errors occur, creating a balance between accuracy and interpretability.

The background of this research involves a global dataset concerning crop production under conventional and no-tillage practices, collected by Su et al. (2021). This dataset provides paired yield observations for eight staple crops across 50 countries, including variables such as crop yield, growing season duration, management practices, soil properties, and climate data for the year of study.

Machine learning techniques were applied to examine the conditions under which no-tillage practices might yield beneficial results compared to conventional tillage. The importance of different variables in the models was assessed through permutation-based methods, which measure the impact of shuffling a variable's values on the model's performance, and averaging these importance measures across multiple iterations.

A key aspect of this study is the distinction between correlation and causation. While machine learning is adept at uncovering correlations, determining causality is crucial for understanding the underlying mechanisms. Correlation may exist in the absence of causation, and conversely, causation can occur without correlation. Although strong correlations can be predictive, caution is advised as reliance on these correlations without considering confounding factors or changes in underlying mechanisms over time may lead to invalid conclusions.
