The paper discusses recent advancements in battery management and the resulting growth in electric vehicle (EV) adoption, motivated by government policies towards clean energy. With over 3 million EVs sold in 2020 and 3.8 million in 2021, the demand for charging infrastructure is increasing. However, the International Energy Agency notes a significant gap as only 8% of public charging stations are available for the total number of EVs, prompting governments to increase the number of AC and DC charging stations by the end of 2022.

Several studies have explored methods to predict and manage the demand for EV charging stations. Ghanbanzadeh et al. proposed a method combining particle swarm and ant colony optimizations for evaluating charging demand and explored the trade-off between operating costs and system reliability in vehicle-to-grid systems. Tan et al. used distributed optimization to cut electricity bills and level out demand response, whereas Xydas et al. developed predictive models for geographically-specific EV charging demand. Yagetekin and Uzunoglu proposed a smart charging strategy to avoid transformer overloads and reduce charging costs.

Luo et al. employed the Monte Carlo technique to forecast long-term EV charging demand, testing on different vehicle types for projections up to 2030. Similarly, Xing et al. predicted EV charging demand using ride-hailing trip data, considering driving and charging patterns. Li and Zhang et al. simulated energy usage patterns over time and employed queuing theory for demand estimation at charging facilities. Bae and Kwasinski also used queuing theory alongside fluid dynamics to scrutinize charging demand at highway stations, aiming to optimize infrastructure planning.

Louie and Buzoa et al. assessed the efficacy of a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average model for predicting EV charging station demand and highlighted the importance of geographical factors.

Machine learning has shown promise in more accurately forecasting demand, with several researchers investigating the use of algorithms like SVM, decision trees, and k-nearest neighbors for both short-term and long-term predictions. However, these methods can underestimate the temporal correlations in data, leading to potential inaccuracies.

Xi Chen et al. suggested a dual approach to encourage EV use and renewable energy adoption, by creating a prioritization algorithm for drivers and proposing a blockchain-based incentive system. They also addressed EV charging as a component of a cyber-physical system, recommending algorithms for station choices and charging schedules, which could convert EV charging from a burden into a grid balancing asset.

Lastly, the paper discusses the NNAR model, an artificial neural network approach for time series data analysis, which relies on historical data patterns for making predictions. The model's performance was tested using a split dataset into training and testing sets according to machine learning norms, employing the Spyder platform in Python and TensorFlow for deep neural network analysis.
