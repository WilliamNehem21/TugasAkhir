The findings discussed in Section 4 are specifically relevant for semantic frameworks that are described by preorders broader than the ready simulation and also encompassed by the set denoted by 'I.' This means that the scope of these results does not extend to more detailed semantics (like those dealing with potential and impossible futures) and also does not include broader preorders that fall outside of the set 'I,' such as trace and complete trace preorders. To address these additional scenarios, we plan to employ the broader findings we have formulated regarding general constrained simulations.
