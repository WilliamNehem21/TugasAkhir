Maintaining proper hydration is essential in endurance sports. Excessive dehydration can decrease performance, while too much hydration with low sodium levels, or hyponatremia, can cause loss of consciousness and even be fatal.

With ethics approval, raw data from four field and three lab studies were analyzed using SPSS Version 19 software. Relationships between different physiological and environmental factors and post-exercise hydration status were examined through bivariate correlation analyses, with a statistical significance threshold of 0.05.

For the classification and prediction of hydration status, datasets were randomized and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models were created and tested using MATLAB R2011b. Both feedforward multilayer perceptron (MLP) and radial basis function (RBF) networks with single hidden layers were examined. Performance was assessed using test data for classification and prediction.

MLP networks outperformed RBF in 87% of the models, showing better mean squared error, correlation, sensitivity, specificity, and Area Under Curve (AUC) values. The best MLP model, with specific neurons in the input, hidden, and output layers, showed high accuracy in estimating athletes' hydration status, considering factors like fluid intake, environmental stress, exercise intensity, gender, and body mass.

Similarly, MLP models were superior in 80% of the estimation models, based on evaluation metrics such as mean squared error, coefficient of variation, and coefficient of determination. The best model here included inputs like environmental stress, exercise intensity, gender, and body mass. It accurately estimated fluid intake in a more precise manner than other models.

A key point from this study is that athletes typically replace only 75% of total water lost when drinking as they feel the need, rather than based on predictive models which often overestimate needs assuming total sweat and water loss are replenished. The study utilized a wider range of variables to classify hydration status and predict fluid intake more accurately with the ANN.

The study corroborated previous findings that body mass, exercise intensity, and ambient temperature are primary factors affecting fluid loss during exercise, but also identified gender as a crucial determinant due to physiological differences in sweating and metabolic rates between men and women.
