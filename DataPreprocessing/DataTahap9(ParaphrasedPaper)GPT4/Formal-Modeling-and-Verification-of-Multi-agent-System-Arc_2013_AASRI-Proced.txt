The academic paper discusses the development of multi-agent systems (MAS), which are utilized in various applications such as online trading, disaster response, and social structure modeling. The paper proposes that adopting a software architecture approach simplifies the complexity of creating distributed systems, which is why it is applied to MAS development. Since MAS applications share similarities at the construction level, a multi-agent system architecture (MASA) is beneficial.

In MAS, distributed agents communicate to achieve tasks, with data stored in information nodes. Agents connect through connectors, and a fault-tolerant agent manages exceptions. The system describes several roles: Query Agents (QA) and Base Agents (BA) exchange interface queries; QA determines if other BAs need to be consulted, while BA identifies the information node with required data. Query Transfer Agents (QTA) handle communication among agents, Monitor Agents (MA) oversee query setup, result reception, and analysis, and Coordinator Agents (CA) identify and analyze potential projects.

The architecture integrates fault-tolerance techniques to manage exceptions, handling local issues or escalating global exceptions that may impact other agents. These global exceptions should be communicated to affected agents for resolution.

The BA theory includes functions like senddata (information transmission to QA), exceptpropagate (passing exceptions to the receiver), uniexceptreceive (receiving exceptions from an agent), and uniexcepthandle (successful exception handling or failure indication).

In the Fault-Tolerant Agent (FTA) theory, functions include exceptrec (receiving global exceptions) and exceptgraph (resolving multiple exceptions into a global one for handling).

The proof script employs lemmas to guide verification processes and uses the PVS theorem prover for automatic validation of fault-tolerant properties and other attributes.
