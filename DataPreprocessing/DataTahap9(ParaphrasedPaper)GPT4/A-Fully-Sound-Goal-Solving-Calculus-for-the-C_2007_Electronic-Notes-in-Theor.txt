The paper discusses a framework for combining constraint logic programming within a functional programming setting--specifically, a calculus for cooperative goal solving that is consistent with the declarative semantics of the combined constraint functional logic programming (CFLP) system incorporating various constraint domains. At the heart of this approach are bridges that work under the assumption that projections are correctly defined, ensuring the calculus is theoretically sound.

The paper is structured as follows:

1. Introduction to the core concepts of constraint domains and solvers,
2. Details on how to coordinate and integrate different constraint domains using coordination domains, bridges, and projections,
3. Presentation of programs, goals, the new cooperative constrained lazy narrowing calculus which is proven to be sound with respect to the defined semantics, and a practical example,
4. A summary of conclusions and outlook on future research.

The paper starts by revisiting the basics of CFLP(D), which is a general framework for lazy constraint functional logic programming parameterized over a constraint domain D. The novel aspect being discussed is the explicit inclusion of a Milner-like polymorphic type system in the context of functional logic programming.

The authors introduce the Cooperative Constrained Lazy Narrowing Calculus (CCLNC(C)) designed to enable cooperative goal solving in CFLP(C) for any coordination domain C. They demonstrate that the calculus is fully sound according to the semantics identified as CRWL(C). The paper describes the superiority of projections over propagations, in that projections can operate on the entire constraint store of a goal, while propagations can only affect certain parts of it, a difference that also makes projections more complex to implement.

A practical example is given where the problem-solving process is broken down into steps, detailing the transformation of goals and omitting explicit existential quantification for clarity. The paper concludes with a comparative analysis of the computations made within the framework.
