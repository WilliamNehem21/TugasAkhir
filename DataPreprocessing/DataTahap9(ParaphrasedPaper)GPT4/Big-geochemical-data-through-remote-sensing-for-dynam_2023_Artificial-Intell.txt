The academic paper describes an innovative approach to deriving geochemical data from remote sensing information, which is inherently rich in big data characteristics such as scalability, velocity, and expansive coverage. Using remote sensing offers a potential for automation and wide-reaching application in geoscientific contexts. There are challenges in converting remote sensing data directly into geochemical information due to issues like overlying materials, varying terrain, and the ambiguity of inversion outcomes, as remote sensing typically identifies mineral species rather than elemental compositions.

Zhang et al. (2023) developed a technique utilizing geostatistical data augmentation paired with machine learning to transform remote sensing data into geochemical data. They tested their method on a tailings storage facility (TSF), linking high-resolution geochemical data with matching remote sensing data to create a composite dataset. This was then used to train various machine learning models.

Extending Zhang et al.'s (2023) work, the current study aims to deploy these models in a real-world setting, with a particular focus on the consistent mineral composition in Witwatersrand tailings. The researchers selected a TSF with similarities to the one in Zhang et al.'s study to ensure consistency in mineral and geochemical configurations. The current study juxtaposes predictions of gold grade from the deployed model with those from a geostatistical model that was not designed for predictive modeling. The outcomes demonstrate the strength of big geochemical data for real-time resource evaluation and environmental surveillance by observing and interpreting changes in gold distribution in the TSF, without relying on geochemical data from the specific TSF being studied.

Qualitative and quantitative comparisons are drawn between model predictions and a geostatistical model constructed on mine-supplied borehole data. The mine's geochemical survey data, collected in 2014, were outdated, offering a contrast in resolution and representation of the TSF's actual condition when compared to the geostatistical model from Zhang et al. (2023). The comparison revealed depletion patterns consistent with known drainage and extraction processes.

The study capitalized on several machine learning algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Random Forest (RF), and Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), for the inversion of remote sensing data into geochemical data. These algorithms were selected based on their effectiveness as highlighted by Zhang et al. (2023). The researchers further included visualizations of temporal changes in a dynamic manner, animating daily snapshots to depict fluctuating gold grade concentrations over the TSF.

Challenges in the transferability of the approach to different terrains are acknowledged, considering the infinite complexity of land cover feature space and potential contamination from nearby tailings dispersal mechanisms.

In summary, the paper showcases the ability to generate high-resolution geochemical datasets through remote sensing and machine learning, exceeding the capabilities of traditional geochemical surveys. This technique allows for a rapid response in monitoring natural processes and human activities affecting tailings storage facilities.
