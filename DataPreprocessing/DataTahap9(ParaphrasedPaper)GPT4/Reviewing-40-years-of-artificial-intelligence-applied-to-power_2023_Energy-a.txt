A McKinsey survey indicates that over half of businesses have incorporated AI in at least one function, commonly within service operations, product development, and marketing and sales. The prevalent applications of AI include optimizing service operations, enhancing products with AI, and automating contact centers.

Despite the growing use of AI in various sectors, there has been a lack of in-depth research on AI's applications and future potential in power systems, which considers the various AI subfields or domains. These domains are part of the AI taxonomy and include areas such as reasoning, learning, and perception, which help analyze the evolution of AI algorithms within specific sectors.

The paper under discussion aims to bridge this gap by providing a taxonomic review of academic works on AI in power systems, looking into aspects such as publication volume, publication years, AI domains, and specific use cases within the power system sector. The research covers 40 years of AI advancements in power systems.

The paper is structured into several sections:

Section 2 discusses what drives AI's increasing role in the power sector.
Section 3 reviews studies on AI use cases in power systems.
Section 4 outlines the methodology.
Section 5 delves into discussing the results.
Section 6 explores new research directions.
Section 7 presents conclusions.

The growing complexity of electrical grids, due to factors like the rise of renewable energy sources, necessitates new tools for planning and operation. Innovations like smart meters and IoT technologies allow for data-driven business opportunities, including improving energy efficiency and reducing costs.

While recent studies have examined AI in energy systems, there's a lack of systematic assessment of AI's most promising domains for specific use cases, or where AI can best benefit the power supply chain.

One comprehensive study sorts nine broad AI application domains in power systems into three categories: maintenance and security, decision making foundations, and distribution/customer services. These applications are ranked by their contribution to the energy transition and maturity.

A study presents a three-dimensional indicator to assess the benefit of AI in the energy sector, factoring in economic savings, regulatory risk, and technological maturity. It compares 15 AI use cases, highlighting forecasting, maintenance, and fault detection, but does not make distinctions between AI domains or offer a systematic approach to the use case selection.

Other studies have investigated AI's application in power systems, mapping out use cases along the supply chain elements such as generation and market operations. However, these studies offer limited insights due to arbitrary case selections or an incomplete focus on power systems.

This paper assesses AI's research maturity in power systems by examining the volume of related academic research, utilizing queries in the Scopus database to quantify the research dedicated to each AI domain and use case.

The paper also considers the role of AI in emerging microgrids, the ability of AI to handle smart grid complexity, and its applications in modeling consumer electricity consumption and predicting energy usage based on socio-demographic factors.

The study provides a holistic analysis of AI use cases, technological maturity, and utilized domains within the power systems, thus helping to identify the most impactful applications of AI in this sector.
