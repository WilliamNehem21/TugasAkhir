This paper presents an exploration into the benefits of employing hexagonal grids, termed honeycomb graphics, as an alternative to traditional square grids in the realm of raster graphics. In two-dimensional (2D) honeycomb graphics, hexagons are used instead of squares (pixels), while in three-dimensional (3D) honeycomb graphics, hexagonal prisms (3-hexels) stand in for cubes (voxels). The authors have established an analytical framework for linear objects within honeycomb graphics akin to the established methods in classical raster graphics.

Historically, raster graphics have heavily relied upon square and cubic grids in both two and three dimensions. Despite the ubiquity of square pixels on screens and cubic voxels in 3D modeling, hexagonal grid-based models have not received as much attention. This paper argues that hexagonal grids (2-hexels for 2D and 3-hexels for 3D) offer several advantages over traditional square-based models.

One notable issue with square grids is the complexity arising from pixel connectivity, which leads to varying tunnel structures. The proposed honeycomb models promise to address this complication, providing a more consistent and tunnel-free representation of objects. The authors recap fundamental ideas from analytical discrete geometry to support their approach.

The paper briefly discusses the concept of analytical discrete geometry, where simple analytical definitions of fundamental Euclidean shapes, such as lines, triangles, and circles in 2D, or planes and spheres in 3D, serve as the foundation for efficiently modeling more complex objects composed of these shapes.

Additionally, the authors highlight the unique properties of the 3-hexel neighborhood in the 3D honeycomb model, with two possible structures that ensure uniform tiling and maintain consistent adjacency between hexagonal prisms.

Concluding their discussion, the authors state that honeycomb graphics based on hexagonal grids or prisms offer an enhanced discretization method, suggesting that they surpass traditional square-based models in representing continuous objects without the issues associated with tunnels. The paper serves as a theoretical motivator for further development and real-world implementation of honeycomb graphics systems.
