The research on author profiling in Arabic-speaking countries, particularly on social media platforms, is still evolving. The paper presents a novel dataset called the Egyptian Dialect Gender Annotated Dataset (EDGAD), which has been sourced from Twitter and contains 70,000 tweets from each gender. It also introduces a text classification methodology to determine an author's gender, which is becoming increasingly vital due to the rise of fake identities on social media.

To perform gender identification (GI), a unique Mixed Feature Vector (MFV) incorporating stylometric aspects and features specific to the Egyptian Arabic Dialect (EAD), in combination with an n-gram Feature Vector (NFV), is used. Two classification models, Random Forest (RF) for MFV and Logistic Regression (LR) for NFV, are integrated using an ensemble weighted average method to improve accuracy. This approach resulted in an 87.6% accuracy rate in identifying gender.

Given the unique complexities of the Arabic language and the necessity to develop GI models and methods tailored to those intricacies, this paper contributes to the field by offering the EDGAD dataset for future research and a comprehensive GI model that ingeniously combines EAD-specific features with n-gram analysis.

The dataset includes male and female subsets, each consisting of 70 accounts. Each account has a varying number of tweets depending on whether the dataset is balanced (capped at 1,000 tweets) or unbalanced. Sevenfold cross-validation is applied such that each fold involves 10 accounts per gender, ensuring that every training set includes 120 accounts while the testing set contains 20 accounts with no overlap.

Word occurrence is thoroughly analyzed, with extensive word lists covering various topics in Egyptian Arabic. For example, a list of swear words and emotional expressions is compiled and expanded upon, taking into account different linguistic variations.

The paper describes the elaboration of a word2vec model using the skip-gram approach to vectorize text data. Tweets not included in the dataset are utilized to train the word2vec model, which is then used to convert each word in a sentence into a vector, eventually averaging these vectors to form a fixed-length representation of the input text.

The research highlights that the combination of Mixed Feature Vector and n-gram Feature Vector approaches, when employed via Random Forest and Logistic Regression classifiers respectively, is chosen based on their superior performance in experiments. These classifiers are then combined using an ensemble weighted average method to enhance prediction accuracy. The detailed experiments section of the paper provides further elucidation on these points.
