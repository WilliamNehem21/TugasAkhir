To harness the benefits of flexible and ergonomic separate compilation services, we propose an analysis and coding technique that works around a common limitation. Our method seeks to achieve a less stringent safety objective than is usually the case: rather than aiming for isochrony, we target the recently suggested concept of weak isochrony.

Endochrony is the principle that a system should deterministically respond to asynchronous external events by deciding internally which events need to be synchronized. This protects local computations and communications from being affected by timing discrepancies in the overall network. However, a significant drawback of endochrony is that it is not compositional, which limits its practical application.

Girault has suggested an alternative approach for the Lustre and Esterel languages. He proposes to duplicate the automaton created from the synchronous module and optimize by removing redundant transitions, which are then replaced by communications between partitions. This distributed code generation aims to maintain the property of endochrony globally while preserving it locally.

Our proposal involves retaining the compositional goal of weak isochrony while assembling endochronous modules. This approach is more efficient for code generation. We have implemented this methodology, which makes use of most of the existing compilation tools from Polychrony, offering a simple synthesis strategy that meets our compilation goals.

The paper presents existing and new compilation techniques in tutorial form, accompanied by examples. It does not delve into the formal aspects or their proofs, relying instead on the analysis algorithms and existing proofs implemented in Polychrony.

The second section of the article serves as a tutorial on the Signal data-flow language and its analysis and scheduling protocols. The third section expands on these topics, covering code generation methods in Polychrony. Our contribution, derived from these methods, is laid out in the fourth section.

Signal supports data-flow synchronous formalism, allowing control and data-flow graphs of multi-clocked specifications to be represented for analysis and modification. In this system, a 'clock' denotes time samples and determines when a data-flow relation should be executed.

A notable feature is the transition function, which converts the hierarchical structure and serialized scheduling graph into C code, optimizing where possible. For example, the transition function returns 'true' when processing concludes successfully, and 'false' if it fails to retrieve input signals, indicating different operational modes for simulation versus embedded code.

We conclude that the buffer process adheres to endochrony, meaning its operation is timed locally. In its transition function, this is observed when it either waits for or sends out signals in a locally paced manner.

For instance, when composing a producer and a consumer, the result is weakly endochronous. The existence of signals is determined locally and deterministically, and their execution order does not affect operations as both scenarios fulfill the diamond property, a hallmark of weak endochrony.

In the controlled program, 'pre_' variables keep track of signals until the next cycle. The 'r' variables reflect synchronization needs due to clock constraints. Functions named '{r|w}_main_x' manage the reading and writing of signals x.

For this system to work, the combined process graph of 'p|q' must be acyclic, and it should not respond to the non-presence of a signal. This means that all clocks in the graph must have a disjunctive structure.

The resulting code is otherwise unchanged. We achieve a concurrent code generation scheme that supports modular, compositional, and separate compilation. Leveraging the current reporting capabilities of Polychrony, it efficiently facilitates the synthesis of a controller that can integrate endochronous processes while preserving the overarching goal of weak isochrony.

To facilitate analysis, we represent the chain of tags for a signal 's' as 't(s)', and use 'min s' and 'max s' for its minimum and maximum tags, respectively. We define the domain of a behavior 'b' as 'v(b)', which refers to a set of signal names. The behavior 'b' restricted to 'x' is denoted as 'b|x' (meanwhile, 'v(b|x)' equals 'x'). The complement 'b/x' (where 'v(b/x)' equals 'v(b) \ x') confirms that behavior 'b' is comprised of 'b|x' combined with 'b/x'. Finally, we use 't' and 'v' broadly to discuss the tags of a behavior 'b' and the set of signal names in a process 'p'.

This paraphrased text succinctly summarizes the academic paper's approach to improving separate compilation services while offering a foundational understanding of the proposed techniques and underlying frameworks.
