The organization of the paper is delineated as follows: Section 2 outlines essential terminology, concepts, and known results. Section 3 establishes the computability of the canonical form and of the set H. Section 4 presents a distinct difference scheme for equation (1) and discusses its characteristics. Section 5 validates the computability of the solution operator for equation (1). The paper concludes with Section 6, which offers a brief contemplation on potential directions for future research.

Moreover, the selection of the difference scheme can vary. The adopted scheme, originating from another source, may be slightly more intricate than the one traditionally utilized, yet it incorporates beneficial features highlighted in the introduction. This scheme is detailed in stages.
