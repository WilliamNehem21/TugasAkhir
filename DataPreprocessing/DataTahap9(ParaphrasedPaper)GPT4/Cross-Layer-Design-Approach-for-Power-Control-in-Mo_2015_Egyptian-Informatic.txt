A mobile ad hoc network (MANET) consists of a group of wireless devices capable of self-organization and data exchange without relying on established network infrastructure or centralized management. These networks have diverse potential uses in areas such as disaster response, military operations, health care, education, and commerce. In a MANET, each device functions dually as both a host and a routing entity.

MANETs operate based on the concept that each node broadcasts to its immediate neighboring nodes within its communication radius. A significant challenge in these networks is related to transmission power issues, which can lead to variable transmission ranges and signal strengths, ultimately calling into question the reliability of MANETs.

Cross-layer design represents a departure from the conventional approach of network design, where each layer is designed to operate in isolation. The Internet Engineering Task Force has a working group that examines the interactions between layers and how they affect the performance of mobile ad hoc networks. They have identified the importance of interactions and information exchange between the various network layers, especially the lower layers, and the relationship with the network and transport layers.

Mahlknecht et al. introduced an energy-efficient routing method named energy aware distance vector routing for wireless sensor networks. Their approach is designed to mitigate the impact of node mobility and the occurrence of link disconnections by incorporating notifications of route failures and reestablishments from intermediate nodes.
