The paper discusses models for determining the optimal point to stop feeding in aquaculture by detecting leftover feed using various cameras. Feeding methods that depend on detecting leftover feed require high-quality detection tools and a suitable breeding environment. As an alternative, novel intelligent feeding methods have been developed, which monitor changes in dissolved oxygen and water temperature during feeding sessions. These methods have shown superior performance compared to conventional techniques, but are less applicable to highly controlled environments like Recirculating Aquaculture Systems (RAS), where these parameters are kept stable.

In light of the limitations of previous methods, researchers have turned to quantifying fish appetite based on their feeding behavior as a more practical option in real-world aquaculture. Recent technological and AI advancements have made this approach a hot topic for research. Chang et al. (2005) designed a feedback control system that adapts feeding practices based on this concept.

The paper then highlights the potential for intelligent feeding methods to both boost production and reduce costs significantly. There is, however, some uncertainty regarding the impact of these intelligent methods on the welfare of fish in aquaculture. To gain a more comprehensive understanding of the effects on fish growth, the researchers developed an adaptive feeder based on a typical intelligent feeding method. They evaluated fish welfare over 47 days by monitoring growth as well as biochemical and immune indicators.

The study set initial feeding quantities and decreased them over time based on appetite assessments, with a set minimum feed amount. Two groups of fish were observed—a traditional feeding group and an intelligent feeding method group—with the only difference being the feeding approach. The fish were fed three times daily with the same commercial feed and weighed every 15 days. Leftover feed was collected after each feeding session to avoid water contamination.

Growth performance indicators such as weight gain ratio (WGR) and specific growth rate (SGR) were higher in the fish fed with the adaptive feeder. The intelligent feeding method group also demonstrated a lower feed conversion ratio (FCR), indicating better feed efficiency and potential cost reductions compared to the traditional group.

The study further examined stress responses by measuring cortisol and immune responses by analyzing lysozyme levels. Fish in the intelligent feeding group exhibited higher cortisol but lower lysozyme levels, suggesting potential negative impacts on health and welfare due to increased susceptibility to pathogens. The intelligent feeding group also showed different antioxidant capacities, with lower superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and higher malondialdehyde (MDA) activity, indicating a potential increase in oxidative stress.

In conclusion, while intelligent feeding can improve fish growth and reduce feed size variability, it may also lead to increased stress and suppressed innate immunity. Future research should focus on combining optimal feeding strategies with intelligent algorithms tailored to specific breeds and adaptable to changing environments.
