In the paper, the authors introduce a new (k, n) threshold verifiable secret image sharing scheme (VSISS) that creates encrypted portions known as shares. This method is capable of detecting cheating participants and allows the recovery of the original secret image without any loss of data quality. Additionally, the scheme is designed such that the likelihood of correctly guessing any individual share of the secret image is significantly reduced.

The text outlines a three-phase verifiable (k, n) secret image sharing scheme that utilizes a third-order Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR)-based public key cryptosystem for the purpose of verification. The three stages are as follows: the initialization phase, the share generation phase, and the verification and recovery phase. The specifics of the initialization phase are described in section 3.1, the share generation scheme in section 3.2, and the verification and recovery strategy is covered in section 3.3.

The paper discusses a method to reconstruct the secret image from k or more shares. It provides a procedure in which any k participants can authenticate each other's shares and combine them to restore the original secret without any loss of information.

Furthermore, the authors address the issue of data storage and the quality of the recovered image. Previous methods described in references [6,7] split a single pixel into two to cope with truncation distortion and required additional storage for the new pixels. Contrastingly, the newly proposed scheme, along with the methods from references [9,10], achieves lossless recovery of the original secret image without necessitating extra storage space. Despite not using additional storage, the recovery process maintains its losslessness.
