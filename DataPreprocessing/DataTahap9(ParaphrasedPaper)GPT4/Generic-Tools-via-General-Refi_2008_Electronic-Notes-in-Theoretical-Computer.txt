In this academic paper, the authors suggest creating tools with separated front-end and back-end components, connected through operational semantics. They primarily focus on the back-end component, aiming to create a general, mathematical framework that allows for greater flexibility during software development through incremental refinement.

The paper highlights that the definition of refinement varies significantly across various formalisms such as CSP, IOA, B, Event B, Z, etc. Integrating different parts of a system that are specified in different languages can be difficult due to these subtle differences. For instance, event-based specification might be suitable for interactive elements, whereas state-based specification could be fit for purely transformational components.

The authors have previously demonstrated that existing refinement techniques can be viewed as particular cases within their general framework, which allows for the translation of refinement definitions between state-based and event-based formalisms. This is possible because of the equivalence (isomorphism) between state-based operational semantics (named partial relations, NPR) and event-based operational semantics (labelled transition systems, LTS).

The paper suggests that since both these operational semantics are common to various formal models, they can serve as a universal intermediate language. To accommodate the design process, the authors adopt flexible definitions of operation and data refinement, presenting a singular general notion of refinement that can then be specialized.

The paper goes on to describe an informal concept of refinement with an example, the technical details of semantics for a tool's flexible back-end, and the method of applying this theory. The authors clarify that the syntax used for defining entities is not of primary concern; instead, they use the Z formalism merely as an example to represent an entity for demonstration purposes.

Additionally, the paper discusses formal modeling of development steps as refinement, emphasizing the retention of previous work and the importance of including observations and contexts within formal definitions of refinement. Observations made by users, modeled as a passive entity, should not be overlooked or discarded in the refinement process.

The concept of flexible refinement introduced in this paper does not dictate the means of representation nor the specifics of the interface between the entity and its context. Focusing on state and not operations in the interface, state-based flexible refinement can add indeterminacy solely by allowing for new states, not considered in the original abstract specification.

The authors conclude by acknowledging they have taken the common informal idea of refinement and developed a new, general definition from it. They illustrate how this definition can be applied to broaden both the state space and the operation set of an entity within the process of refinement.
