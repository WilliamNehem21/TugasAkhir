The paper discusses the concept of normalization in the context of C programming language, emphasizing that it addresses the issues arising from padding in structured value representations and the possibility of multiple byte representations for a single value in C, even for primitive types. Normalization provides a way to measure and compare different C types.

Moreover, the paper suggests extended rules that enable detailed examination of heap assertions for structured type values, proving useful for extracting specific information and fulfilling certain rule conditions or theorems, such as Theorem 6.4. These rules enhance the flexibility of assertions' granularity.

Drawing from a given list reversal example that was previously in-place, the paper observes that the proof script remained comparable in structure and length, comprising 67 lines. The authors note that for type-safe C code, tedious details like lifts and heap updates can be minimized, making the process less cumbersome for the user. Nonetheless, the paper admits that a full, encompassing completeness result cannot be achieved with this simplified approach.
