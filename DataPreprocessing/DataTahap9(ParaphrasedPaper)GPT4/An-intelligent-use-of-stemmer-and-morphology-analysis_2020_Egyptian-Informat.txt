This paper presents a novel method for Arabic word stemming, named Arabic Morphology Information Retrieval (AMIR), designed to enhance information retrieval in Arabic by efficiently identifying the stems, or roots, of words. AMIR employs a rule-based system that takes into account the intricate relationships between Arabic letters, aiding in the indexing process of Arabic text search. In addition, the paper explores the construction of Arabic words from roots, usually trilateral, which form the basis of most Arabic verbs and nouns. Unlike other languages, Arabic incorporates changes in form for plurality, gender, and tense, which pose challenges for existing stemming methods and yield high error rates.

The work examines the limitations of current Arabic information retrieval techniques, particularly in stemming and morphological analysis, and introduces an approach utilizing both prefixes and infixes, along with traditional suffixes, to improve result accuracy. The paper also reviews previous light stemming strategies, such as those proposed by Larkey, but suggests that these are insufficient in dealing with the complexities of infixes.

By comparing AMIR to other systems, including Lucene, the Farasa stemmer, and a no-stemming approach, the authors demonstrate superior performance in mean average precision, with AMIR achieving 0.34% against the other systems' lower scores. The methods and results outlined in this study serve to underscore the potential of AMIR to notably advance Arabic stemming and information retrieval efficacy.
