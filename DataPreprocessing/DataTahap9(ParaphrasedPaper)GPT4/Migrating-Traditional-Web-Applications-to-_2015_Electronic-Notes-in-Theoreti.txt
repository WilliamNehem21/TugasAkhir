In recent years, Content Management Systems (CMS) have become key in managing the growing volume of digital content on web applications, leading many organizations to transition their web applications onto CMS platforms. This migration process, however, is complex and fraught with errors. To streamline this, we propose an automated migration method based on Architecture-Driven Modernization (ADM), utilizing model-driven architecture techniques to systematize software reengineering, reducing risks and costs. Our approach employs ADM's standardized metamodels: the Abstract Syntax Tree Metamodel (ASTM) and the Knowledge Discovery Metamodel (KDM).

The methodology introduced involves three tasks during the reverse engineering stage: 1) extraction of ASTM PHP models from legacy PHP code using a domain-specific language called ASTM PHP DSL, which represents PHP code's syntax and semantics at a platform-specific level; 2) generation of KDM models from the ASTM PHP models to represent the legacy code's syntax and semantics at a platform-independent level through model-to-model (M2M) transformations using the Atlas Transformation Language (ATL); 3) automatic generation of the CMS model from the KDM models, which captures knowledge within the CMS domain at a platform-independent level using M2M transformations.

A case study demonstrates the feasibility of this method by migrating a PHP widget to the Drupal CMS platform. We define the metamodels and transformation rules essential for this process, including those that convert PHP-specific code into elements within the KDM metamodel. Future work includes extending the method to support migration from any programming language, as well as further development of modeling languages and transformation rules to fully automate the process.
