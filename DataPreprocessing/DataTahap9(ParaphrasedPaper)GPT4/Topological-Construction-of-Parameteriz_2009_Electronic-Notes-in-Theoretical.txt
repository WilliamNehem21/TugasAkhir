In this paper, the authors present an extension of the strong bisimulation topology to a variety of parametric bisimulation limit topologies. By utilizing parametric limit bisimulation, they construct topological structures that aid in understanding and analyzing infinite process evolution. These structures rely entirely on process behaviors, making them extensible and observable. The paper delves into the properties of parametric limit bisimulation, with a focus on subnet closure, tail closure, natural extension, and iteration structure, as these concepts provide greater insight into the infinite evolution from a mathematical perspective.

Drawing on parametric limit bisimulation, the authors emphasize the need for certain levels of determinism in the involved processes due to their dependency on their environment. They explore a special structural aspect of parametric limit bisimulation, which demonstrates that the composition of two such bisimulations also constitutes a parametric limit bisimulation. This finding holds significance for the composite execution of certain programs. The authors provide simplified definitions and useful concepts, borrowing from the literature on product directed sets.

Notably, the paper discusses how topologies can be derived from existing convergence structures. Specifically, the authors construct a set of parametric bisimulation limit topologies based on the concept of parametric bisimulation limit. Among the key findings is Proposition 4.2, which verifies that the parametric bisimulation limit forms a convergence class and thereby generates a process topology.
