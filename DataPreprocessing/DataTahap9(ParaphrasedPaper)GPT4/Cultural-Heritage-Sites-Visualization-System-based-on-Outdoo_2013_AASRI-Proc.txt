This academic paper discusses the growing significance of history and the expansion of the cultural contents industry, particularly in the restoration of cultural heritage sites using augmented reality (AR) technology. Despite the advancements in this field, the application of digital restoration systems has been predominantly limited to indoor settings. The paper proposes a system designed to visualize 3D models of cultural heritage sites outdoors, using AR technology that incorporates object panorama, the SURF algorithm, and GPS technology. This system aims to enhance accessibility and engagement with information about cultural heritage sites, allowing users to experience them with more immersion and realism.

The paper emphasizes the difference between indoor and outdoor AR, noting that while the former relies on markers within a confined space, the latter utilizes locational data, allowing for AR experiences without spatial constraints. By presenting a system that overlays 3D models onto real-time outdoor video feeds on smartphones, users can interact with cultural site information seamlessly both indoors and out. This development represents a significant step in transcending the limitations of traditional, location-bound restoration approaches, offering new possibilities for education and engagement with cultural heritage.
