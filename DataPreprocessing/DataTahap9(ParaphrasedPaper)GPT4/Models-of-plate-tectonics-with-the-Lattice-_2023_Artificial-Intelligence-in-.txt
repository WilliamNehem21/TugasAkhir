The discovery of plate tectonics revolutionized geological science, and it was the product of vast amounts of new seafloor bathymetry data coupled with bold new analytical methodologies. Looking ahead, the field of geodynamics stands on the precipice of a transformative era, where the fusion of artificial intelligence and high-performance computing (HPC) simulations will redefine modeling practices. Although the use of HPC among geoscientists is increasing, there is a pressing demand for dynamic tools that can rapidly and reliably produce extensive datasets for training and validation of machine learning models.

In the realm of computational modeling, performance optimization for parallel computing platforms is critical, especially since models must remain efficient when handling complex geological behaviors such as non-linear rheologies, which play a significant role in the fragmentation of the Earth's surface into tectonic plates.

In a practical example, an implementation of the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) for simulating viscous flows was able to achieve considerable computational efficiency on a system with 16 CPU cores of 2.2 GHz Xeon processors. The kernel of these simulations achieved 78% of the theoretical peak performance per core, while the full LBM algorithm, including data streaming and communication between cores, reached 44% of the peak per core. The code is designed to work in both two and three dimensions, highlighting its versatility.

This research also demonstrates the contrasting convective patterns in the Earth's mantle. In cases of different viscosities, the mantle exhibits diverse behaviors such as distributed convection within the upper layer, which can be observed as smaller cells or broad, horizontally flowing regions.

Machine learning, particularly supervised learning techniques like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and support vector machines, have already seen application in geoscience image analysis. These techniques are expanding into the study of full convection models. For instance, CNNs have been employed to deduce essential parameters such as Prandtl and Rayleigh numbers from simulation snapshots of convection. With advancements in generative artificial intelligence, future prospects include predicting mantle dynamics, as has been shown with atmospheric convection studies.

Despite the potential of these methods, challenges persist, particularly in generating the vast, high-quality datasets required for machine learning training. Lattice Boltzmann Methods offer a promising solution, showcasing exceptional scalability across numerous processors and the capability to model a wide range of Prandtl numbers, making them ideally suited for generating the datasets vital for advancing research in geodynamics.
