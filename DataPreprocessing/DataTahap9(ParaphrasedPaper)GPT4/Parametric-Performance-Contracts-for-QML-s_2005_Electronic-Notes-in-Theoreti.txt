The academic paper introduces a concept called parametric performance contracts, which are used to model the performance of services based on the performance of external services. These contracts consider the time consumption of both external services and internal computations as continuous random variables. However, the paper highlights a problem with this approach: the lack of compositionality - meaning that the outputs of these performance models aren't easily usable as inputs for other models, preventing the chaining or connecting of components. This is because, when using continuous distribution functions, the resulting function may not fit the same class of distribution as the inputs.

The paper is structured into various sections. Section 2 explains what component contracts are and discusses parametric contracts, introducing a language known as Quality of Service Modelling Language (QML) which includes discrete probability distributions and other stochastic concepts. Section 3 focuses on dependency models and defines parametric performance contracts. Section 4 reviews related work, and Section 5 summarizes the findings and mentions unresolved issues.

Moreover, the paper points out the need for extending service effect automata to incorporate linear performance metrics. Although QML, and its variant CQML, allow for quality of service contracts, their ability to reason compositionally about multiple contracts is not well developed. The paper emphasizes that services are not neatly Gaussian distributed; they tend to have a minimum execution time but can experience various delays, making the distribution asymmetrical.

Discrete functions can be used to avoid the complexity of continuous functions, but they come with their own computational challenges, especially as computations such as convolution and Fourier transforms become expensive with many sampling points.

The paper suggests that to apply their model, one needs to compute the discrete Fourier transform of the probability mass function for each state and external service, and then all subsequent calculations are based on these transforms. The inverse Fourier transform is applied to the result to conclude the analysis.

In summary, the paper discusses a parametric and compositional model for performance analysis, advocating for the use of discrete distribution functions for external service calls, and suggests using QML for defining these distributions at the interface level. The accuracy of the model depends on the level of detail specified in the QML configuration.
