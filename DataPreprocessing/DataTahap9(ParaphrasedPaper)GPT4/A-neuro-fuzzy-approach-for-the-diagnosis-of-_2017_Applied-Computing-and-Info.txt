The field of psychiatry is recognized as one of the most intricate areas within medical sciences because psychiatric disorders cannot be quantified directly due to their unclear symptoms. The outcomes of clinical assessments and treatments must be interpreted in relation to the progression of each condition, but this subjective interpretation can introduce bias into the decision-making process.

Recognizing the onset of depression is particularly challenging, as it can emerge secondary to various non-psychiatric conditions, such as cancer or persistent pain, and commonly shares symptoms with other illnesses. Additionally, a range of diseases could be the underlying cause of a single set of symptoms, such as in the case of comorbid depression and mania. Consequently, screening for depression and reaching a definitive diagnosis can be an extensive process.

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 explores the use of fuzzy sets, fuzzy logic, and neural networks in mental health research. The methodology is detailed in Section 3, while Section 4 presents and discusses the experimental outcomes. Section 5 wraps up with the primary conclusions of the study.

In separate research, a fuzzy decision tree was applied to categorize 50 cases of premenstrual syndrome (PMS), a condition that intersects the fields of gynecology and psychiatry. The study utilized the intensity of fuzzy rule activation to grade PMS, with the more influential rules forming the foundation of a PMS diagnostic rule base. The authors found that constructing an effective rule base is possible even for intricate disorders that lack standardized diagnostic criteria.

Another study leveraged artificial neural networks (ANN) to analyze suicide risk in Taiwanese soldiers, identifying ten factors impacting this risk. Using radial basis function (RBF) networks for training, the created model demonstrated high accuracy in suicide risk prediction with a sensitivity of 82% and specificity of 86%.

Moreover, RBF and backpropagation neural networks (BPNN) were employed to create a decision support system (DSS) to aid rural physicians in diagnosing psychiatric conditions, with BPNN used for feature extraction. The DSS boasts a remarkable diagnostic accuracy of 98.75%.

Researchers also assessed a neuro-fuzzy modelâ€™s performance in forecasting weight fluctuations in chronic schizophrenic patients under prolonged antipsychotic treatment, employing software to develop its rules. The model accurately predicted weight changes in 93% of cases.

Finally, to distinguish between epileptic and nonepileptic events, investigators utilized fuzzy arithmetic and the NEFCLASS (neuro-fuzzy classification) system, integrating it with ANNs and backpropagation (ANNB) algorithms. The research achieved an 85% sensitivity in differentiating these events, while the ANNB method reached an even higher sensitivity of 95.65%.
