The paper discusses the growing usage of non-classical logics in practical applications, which presents significant challenges to the field of automated reasoning, especially regarding scalability of existing methods. To enhance scalability, strategies include optimizing proof calculus or applying existing rules more effectively. Maude, a tool that supports reflection and allows for strategic runtime decisions, is highlighted for its clean separation of deduction and strategy, simplifying theorem proving by using specifications containing deductive rules and applying them to terms.

The paper argues for separating the strategy from the rules to reduce complexity and errors. An intermixing of rules and strategic processes is more prone to mistakes, while building strategies directly into rules makes them inflexible and difficult to modify. However, completely separating them is not always practical, as sometimes it's simpler to embed strategic pruning in inference rules.

It mentions that first-order logic (FOL) formulas can be transformed into prenex disjunctive normal form (PDNF) for processing, using a matrix representation to facilitate proof search with the connection calculus, which is guided by connecting clauses and unification to constrain substitutions. This process typically involves iterative deepening and backtracking to explore the search space efficiently. Maude features meta-representational capabilities and customizable rule application strategies to support this process.

A search strategy for identifying connections is proposed, focusing on a process that respects certain order and keeps track of substitutions and index values. The paper also covers clause copying both before a proof search and dynamically during it, to avoid variable naming conflicts and maintain the completeness of the proof method.

Finally, the paper concludes by reinforcing the benefits of using rewriting logic and Maude in developing a connection-driven search engine for FOL. This approach allows for flexible experimentation with different search strategies while using the same deductive core.
