The study examines data from the years 1960 to 2010 to analyze the connection between U.S. foreign trade and economic growth. Granger causality tests revealed a two-way causal link between American exports and GDP, meaning changes in exports could predict changes in GDP and vice versa. However, the relationship between imports and GDP was one-way; imports did not Granger-cause changes in GDP. In simpler terms, efforts to stimulate U.S. economic growth by limiting imports seem futile based on the data.

Post-financial crisis, the U.S. implemented trade barriers such as anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures to decrease its imports and reduce its trade deficit, aiming to boost the economy. These measures have negatively impacted the trading interests of its partners, and the actual effect of imports on U.S. economic growth requires further review.

Using data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis and analyzed via EViews 6.0 software, the study determined the optimal lag length as 2, based on information criteria, for constructing Vector Autoregression (VAR) models. The VAR(2) model fit the data very well, as indicated by an R-squared value of 0.998454.

The research indicates that America's GDP does Granger-cause its imports (a reflection of how economic growth increases demand for goods and services, including those sourced from other countries), but the converse is not trueâ€”increases in imports do not cause GDP growth. Also, no Granger causality was found between imports and exports.

In conclusion, the study suggests that America's current foreign trade policies are not effective in boosting the economy. A new approach should focus on expanding exports rather than constraining imports to foster economic growth.
