In this paper, the authors explore the effectiveness of multilevel governance in facilitating sustainable energy policies, focusing particularly on how regional and provincial levels can bolster the engagement of small local authorities within the Covenant of Mayors initiative. The study investigates the support mechanisms that are paramount for these smaller entities to effectively participate in and contribute to sustainability objectives. By examining the role that intermediate governance levels play, the paper underscores the importance of collaboration and support systems in achieving energy efficiency and broader sustainability goals, highlighting the strategic position of regions and provinces in empowering small local authorities to meet the requirements of the Covenant of Mayors.
