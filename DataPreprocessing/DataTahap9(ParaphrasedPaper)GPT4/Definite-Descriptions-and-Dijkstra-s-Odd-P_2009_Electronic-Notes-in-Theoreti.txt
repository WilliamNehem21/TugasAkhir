The article discusses the application of Frege-Russell-style definite descriptions to the process of creating functional programs and how this leads to the formulation of correct imperative programs. It explores the role of these descriptions in the context of a specific problem referred to as "odd powers of odd integers," which was previously addressed by Dijkstra.

The notion of using definite descriptions traces its roots to the work of logicians Frege, Russell, Quine, and Scott. These concepts play a pivotal role in the formulation of functional programs, akin to the use of assertions in the development of imperative programs, a methodology advocated by Dijkstra, Gries, and the refinement calculus.

When the concern regarding program termination is set aside, it is relatively simple to conceive a partially correct program. However, ensuring the program terminates as expected, which is essential for total correctness, requires induction-based proofs. By employing such proofs, one can design a basic functional program. This functional program can then be refined into a fully correct imperative program, paralleling the approach taken by Dijkstra.

Moreover, by examining additional properties of the program specification through the functional program, it is possible to conceive an alternate functional program. Although this secondary program is straightforward in its functional form, transitioning it into an imperative program is more complex. This transition process involves converting linear recursion into a tail-recursive structure, which subsequently allows for a more direct conversion to imperative programming. The tail-recursive programs assist in defining the invariants needed for loop constructs in the imperative program.

The described imperative program operates by iterating through odd integers until it encounters a value that satisfies a specific mathematical condition involving powers of two and odd numbers. Testing shows the program halts for specified inputs, but such testing alone is insufficient to guarantee its correctness. Importantly, it is required to demonstrate that if and when the loop concludes, the program will deliver accurate outcomes.
