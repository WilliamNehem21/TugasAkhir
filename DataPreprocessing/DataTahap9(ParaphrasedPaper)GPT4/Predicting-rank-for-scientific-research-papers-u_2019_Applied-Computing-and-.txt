This paper discusses the future of system development via automatic data processing, with a focus on applying automatic classification methods to scientific research as a form of supervised learning. The authors identify key features essential for predicting rankings in this learning framework and provide a comprehensive review of previous work in ranking scientific papers. They then evaluate and compare various classification approaches including supervised, semi-supervised, and non-supervised learning based on their performance using different metrics like NDCG, MAP, GMAP, F-measure, precision, and recall.

The researchers use the SMO classifier and KStar classifier to represent the neural network of nodes (papers) and edges (citations) between authors, reflecting the collaborative nature of scientific research. They suggest that existing literature has focused on ranking papers by query relevance or technical analysis but has not offered insights into future classification predictions. The current study contributes by aiming to predict future classifications based on existing papers, which could help researchers find the most relevant and highly ranked papers in their field.

The paper is structured to review related work on ranking scientific research papers, describe state-of-the-art learning methods, present the methods used for analysis, discuss the results, and conclude with future research directions. The researchers acknowledge limitations in current ranking algorithms and propose a novel dual-classifier approach for iterative learning, where classifiers act as both teacher and pupil until convergence. They conclude by emphasizing the need for data preprocessing to extract valuable information from databases like Web of Science for their algorithms, which consider factors such as paper titles, authors, keywords, posting time, publication conference, citation count, download rates, and publication frequency.
