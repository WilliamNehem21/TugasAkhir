The primary nutritional elements found in soil include carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), silicon (Si), sulfur (S), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), and others. These elements are crucial for assessing soil fertility and are essential for plant growth and physiological functioning.

Glumac et al. (2010) optimized LIBS (Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy) to minimize the interference from iron (Fe) when analyzing for organic carbon (OC) in soil. Erler et al. (2020) utilized handheld LIBS spectrometers for soil nutrient analysis and found that LASSO and GPR regression methods outperformed PLSR. He et al. (2018) demonstrated that double-pulse LIBS is more accurate for soil nutrient detection. Nicolodelli et al. (2014) and Nicolodelli et al. (2015) improved LIBS methods to analyze carbon amidst aluminum interference and increased sensitivity using dual-pulse excitation. Martin et al. (2010) created robust calibration models for carbon prediction using LIBS, independent of soil properties, and further differentiated between types of carbon in soils using LIBS combined with multivariate analysis (Martin et al., 2013).

Knadel et al. (2017) compared LIBS to VIS-NIRS for soil property prediction, finding similar accuracy except for sand content. Izaurralde et al. (2013) compared LIBS to other advanced soil carbon measuring technologies against the dry combustion method. Ding et al. (2019) boosted the accuracy and speed of heavy metal detection in soil using LIBS combined with interval partial least squares (iPLS). Zhao et al. (2019) employed deep learning to classify LIBS data of lead-contaminated soil, showing superior performance to other machine learning methods.

Yuan et al. (2016) measured chromium (Cr) using LIBS, achieving a 12.1% relative standard deviation. Ferreira et al. (2008) and Motto-Ros et al. (2008) successfully applied Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for calibration in LIBS analysis. Dell'Aglio et al. (2011) determined heavy metal concentrations in soil with LIBS and suggested anthropogenic indices for some metals.

Chatterjee et al. (2019) identified soil sample variations using LIBS and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Akhtar et al. (2018) enhanced LIBS detection limits for heavy metals in soil using a magnetic field. Bousquet et al. (2007) quantitatively analyzed Cr in soils with LIBS and classified soils using PCA. Kim et al. (2014) improved the precision of LIBS for zinc (Zn) detection by combining data processing methods.

Fu et al. (2018) enhanced LIBS signals for cadmium detection in soils using a spatial confinement container. Mukhono et al. (2013) applied chemometric methods to LIBS spectra for trace element prediction and soil sample classification from a geothermal field exhibiting high-background radiation.

Other studies expanded LIBS applications to various materials like coal, ores, and water, showcasing the technique's potential in different contexts (Deng et al., 2020; Ma et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Judge et al., 2013; Schroder et al., 2013; Gottfried et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2018). Moreover, LIBS has been utilized for early diagnosis of plant diseases, as demonstrated in studies involving citrus and other crops (Sankaran et al., 2015; Ponce et al., 2018).

Overall, extensive research has been conducted on using LIBS for soil analysis, emphasizing the need for novel approaches to enhance the models for environmental monitoring and agricultural applications. Researchers continue to explore LIBS as a potent tool for rapid and efficient chemical analysis across various fields.
