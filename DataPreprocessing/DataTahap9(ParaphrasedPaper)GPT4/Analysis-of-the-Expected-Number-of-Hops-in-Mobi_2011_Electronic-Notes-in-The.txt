The study investigates the average number of hops needed for data to traverse between source and destination nodes in multi-hop ad hoc networks, particularly under the influence of random node mobility. Existing literature often disregards the effect of node mobility on hop counts in such networks, with previous studies focusing on stationary nodes and fixed distributions in network areas.

This paper introduces a theoretical framework to predict the average hop count in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), where nodes follow a Random Waypoint Mobility Model (RWPMM). The model takes into account various network parameters, including node density, area size, and transmission range.

The researchers developed a Maximum Hop Distance (MHD) routing method, which analytically calculates the average hop count without needing extensive simulations. This method optimizes packet forwarding by selecting the relay node with the maximum progression towards the destination.

Simulations validate the proposed theoretical model. Experiments with 200 uniformly distributed nodes within an area of varying side length and with transmission ranges of either 200 or 250 meters demonstrate the impact of these parameters on the expected number of hops. Nodes move continuously, with speeds up to 20 m/s, and the simulations leverage the MobiSim tool and the setdest tool from the NS-2 simulator for mobility pattern generation.

Results show that the proposed model accurately estimates the required number of hops in MANETs with randomly moving nodes. This study provides a valuable contribution to understanding and improving multi-hop ad hoc network performance in environments with random mobility, setting it apart from prior work that mostly assumed stationary node distributions.
