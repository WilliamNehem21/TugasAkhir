The current academic paper discusses the issues in information infrastructure within universities, highlighting the lack of cohesive planning, inconsistent levels of development, and the absence of unified construction standards. The initial designs did not consider the overall needs of the university departments, leading to a situation where each college or department developed its own application systems, creating a series of "informational islands." There is now a pressing need for these departments to integrate their separate systems and databases to facilitate information sharing.

Apache Synapse is presented as a solution to these challenges. It is described as a lightweight, high-performing enterprise service bus (ESB) that operates primarily as a web service mediator built on the foundation of Apache Axis2. Its key strengths are its fast, asynchronous mediation engine and support for multiple content formats, such as plain text, binary, Hessian, and JSON. Synapse can interact with many applications through its various transport adapters, specializing in routing, message transformation, and secure web services communication, all while adhering to XML standards.

Moreover, Apache Synapse is engineered for quick XML routing, employing a streaming XML architecture based on Apache Axiom. Its completely asynchronous infrastructure and non-blocking I/O contribute to its minimal overhead and its capability to manage thousands of concurrent clients effectively. Synapse also offers a consistent framework for management policies and services, enabling control over layers such as authentication, logging, load balancing, and more, leading to more efficient and effective resource management within organizations. Lastly, by transforming existing application systems into web services, Apache Synapse allows organizations to present information from various sources cohesively, providing a single access point for users through standardized application interfaces.
