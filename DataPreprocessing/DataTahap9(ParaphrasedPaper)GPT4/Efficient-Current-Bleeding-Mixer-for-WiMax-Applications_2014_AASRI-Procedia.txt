The growing need for secure, fast, and high-capacity data communication links, ideally accessible via portable devices such as laptops and smartphones through wireless connections, has positioned WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) as a key technology to consider. WiMAX systems are capable of providing long-range coverage with fewer base stations than other wireless technologies, offering the advantage of reduced costs in terms of maintenance, operation, and management (J. Molleke et al.).

To improve the conversion gain by augmenting the current in the radio-frequency (RF) stage, a current bleeding block (composed of resistors R1 and R2) was integrated with transistors M1 and M2. This design aims to ensure that M1 and M2 operate within their saturation regions, while simultaneously lowering the current in the local oscillator (LO) stage. Consequently, this results in a voltage drop across the load resistors R6 and R7.
