This paper investigates the decision problems of reachability, normalization, and neededness within the context of n-shallow and n-growing term rewriting systems (TRSs). An n-growing TRS is defined such that any variable appearing on both the left and right sides of a rewrite rule must appear at depth n on the left side and at a depth greater than n on the right side. Conversely, an n-shallow TRS requires a variable to appear at depth n on both sides of a rewrite rule.

The study aims to define the limits of decidability for the above problems by introducing n-growing and n-shallow TRSs as extensions of previously studied growing and shallow TRSs, known for the decidability of reachability, normalization, and neededness (the latter in the orthogonal case).

The paper establishes that neededness is decidable for orthogonal growing TRSs, asserting that since every 1-growing TRS is also a growing TRS, reachability, normalization, and neededness (in the orthogonal case) are decidable for 1-growing TRSs. Nevertheless, these findings do not extend to n-growing TRSs for n greater than 1.

Furthermore, the research demonstrates that adding a rule to the TRS from the proof of Theorem 4.3 does not affect the equivalence between the reachability of certain terms and the existence of a solution to the n-PCP problem, while establishing that a term has a normal form if and only if the n-PCP problem is solvable.

The paper also confirms that neededness is decidable for orthogonal shallow TRSs and that similar decidability results for reachability, normalization, and neededness hold for 1-shallow TRSs, as every 1-shallow TRS is a shallow TRS. However, these results do not generalize to n-shallow TRSs when n is greater than 1.
