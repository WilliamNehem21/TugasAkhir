Alex Simpson proposed a method for incorporating computational effects into denotational semantics using an observation-driven approach. This involves using a single observation algebra to define computational types, thus providing an algebraic structure and enabling a tangible characterization of monadic types.

The paper demonstrates that, within the context of continuous maps between topological spaces, it is possible to establish the existence of free algebras that are induced by any given observation algebra. Furthermore, this method is applied to develop both lower and upper powerdomain constructions on general topological spaces, extending beyond the traditional constructs on continuous domains with directed complete partial orders (dcpos).

The lower powerdomain is constructed for all topological spaces and is represented by the space of non-empty closed subsets equipped with the lower Vietoris topology. Conversely, for a broad class of topological spaces, the upper powerdomain is constructed using the space of proper open filters with the upper Vietoris topology.

However, the paper also provides a counterexample to illustrate that this characterization does not apply universally across all topological spaces.

The paper then proceeds to outline a general framework for creating observationally-induced free algebras, situated within the category of continuous maps between topological spaces, while noting that this framework could potentially be adapted to other categories as well.

The paper also mentions that the category of Wilker spaces, which covers a substantial range of spaces, including all Hausdorff and locally compact spaces, is extensive. However, spaces that do not comply with this methodology tend to be somewhat unnatural, as exemplified by a particular counterexample discussed in the paper. It remains unclear whether the Wilker condition is upheld through standard practices in denotational semantics.
