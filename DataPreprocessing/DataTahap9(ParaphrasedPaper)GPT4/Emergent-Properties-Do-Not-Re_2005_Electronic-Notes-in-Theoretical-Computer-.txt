This position paper delves into the complexities of achieving demonstrably correct development in emergent systems using refinement, a method traditionally employed to progress from an abstract specification to a concrete implementation. The paper addresses the unique challenges emergent systems pose to refinement, primarily attributable to the disparity between their local component-level descriptions and the global system behaviors.

The authors use the example of a cellular automaton (CA) capable of producing gliders to explore the development issues of emergent systems. The CA is chosen for its simplicity as an emergent system, where operation is governed by a predetermined representation and a singular update rule. This scenario serves as a foundation for discussing the broader challenges in the development of other emergent systems.

Initially, the paper offers a concise overview of classical refinement techniques. It then defines emergence within a framework where lower-level agent behaviors and interactions are described in one language, while the higher-level global behaviors are in another. The paper argues that the disconnect between these descriptive languages presents a significant hurdle to applying traditional refinement.

For example, the authors illustrate emergence through a CA, representing the agents as cells governed by update rules and a defined set of neighboring cells. This model is proposed to resemble other emergent systems more closely by separating the representation of the spatial domain from the active entities, as seen in systems involving agents like ants or flocking birds.

The CA evolves into an operational system as the cells, each with a distinct state, are placed within a discretized space, often visualized through color or shading. To address the system's non-deterministic aspects, such as the movement of gliders, the authors suggest refining the representation to define motion against a discrete spatial framework, such as a grid system.

The paper touches upon the concept of termination within continuous emergent systems by applying finalization, a process where each component contributes to the system's collective behavior. As an example, each cell progresses to a new state at a time step, and finalization guarantees the updated representation's incorporation into the larger system instantaneously.

The authors note that in CAs, different levels of the system serve as derivatives of each other: cells are one-dimensional, representation introduces multi-dimensionality, and the time dimension emerges at the system level. Consequently, cells acquire a position within the representation, and their collective behavior appears to exhibit motion at the system level.

In discussing refinement, the paper acknowledges that the process often involves trial and error, contrary to what formal refinement techniques suggest. Real-world refinement is frequently messier than academic examples indicate. The authors mention concepts such as retrenchment, which recognizes the rarity of clean refinement paths, and various iterative approaches that allow for back-and-forth adjustments until a suitable model is achieved.

In summary, the paper outlines the challenge of adapting classical refinement to emergent systems, proposes a model for understanding such systems, and explores potential methods for system development that may still draw upon classical refinement principles.
