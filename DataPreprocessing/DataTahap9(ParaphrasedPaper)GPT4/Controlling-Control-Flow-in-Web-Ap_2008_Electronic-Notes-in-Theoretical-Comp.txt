Prior research has utilized continuations to manage user interactions on the web, but these have been deemed inadequate for representing the full spectrum of web interactions. The authors argue that the web's underlying protocol and browsers lack the necessary functionality to accurately express the desired control flow in a web application.

The paper explores possible implementations of these concepts within the current HTTP/1.1 protocol and suggests minor protocol modifications that could fully enable their integration. It also discusses how these enhancements would interact with the features of Web 2.0 and considers their security and privacy implications.

The web began as a medium for publishing and reading hypertext documents. Over time, it has evolved into a complex user interface platform. Web servers now provide dynamic access to a range of services from file editing to financial transactions, while browsers have introduced features like multiple windows, tabbed browsing, and cookies, fostering increased user collaboration.

Web applications employ cookies to simulate a stateful environment. However, challenges arise when multiple browser windows are used, leading to potential misinterpretation of the user's actions. For example, a user might have two different shopping windows open and encounter unexpected results when attempting to make a purchase.

The authors posit practical ways of implementing necessary extensions to improve web interactions, both within the existing HTTP protocol and through browser enhancements. These improvements could have security and privacy impacts.

Web applications often use the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern to separate concerns, with the server handling most of the model and controller logic and the client represented by the HTML pages. However, in practice, the controller is frequently neglected, reducing MVC to a mere client-server model.

The authors advocate for a stronger role for the controller as part of the browser, coordinating the multiple views (browser windows) of an application. While this isn't a perfect solution, it offers an improved abstraction over current practices, despite limitations in controlling simultaneous access to the model by multiple users.

In the MVC approach, views are usually informed by the model about changes, something unfeasible with HTTP. As such, users must manually refresh their views or have the views poll the model for updates.

The paper also addresses issues such as window closing notifications, which would help preserve user data for later continuation of their session. Although Web 2.0 allows views to fetch new data without a full refresh, allowing view updates without reloading the model would be beneficial.

The proposed features are not meant to enhance security but rather to improve user experience, and there is the risk of developers creating less secure applications if they rely too heavily on these features. Future work aims to develop a framework allowing servers to enforce constraints that could be communicated to the browser.

Lastly, the authors suggest ways to minimize privacy concerns by treating each web application (by domain) distinctly, using separate identifiers to prevent cross-application user tracking. Additionally, browsers could request user consent before treating a site as a web application based on the metadata provided by the server.
