This academic paper discusses the use of set-theoretic categories, which involve categories where objects are sets or classes from a universe that may not be well-founded, and morphisms are set- or class-theoretic functions. These categories are instrumental in exploring the fundamentals of the coalgebraic approach to coinduction. Despite their utility, set-theoretic categories previously did not garner substantial attention from category theorists or set-theorists due to differing ideological reasons.

The paper is structured as follows:

- Section 1 refreshes readers on set theory definitions and fundamental concepts of set-theoretical categories, including set-based and inclusion preserving functors, as well as the Aczel-Mendler final coalgebra theorem.

- Section 2 examines the properties of inclusion preserving functors, which are crucial for the paper's main findings.

- Section 3 improves upon the Aczel-Mendler theorem by proving that all class-theoretic functors have final coalgebras.

- Section 4 looks into two types of partially defined endofunctors within set-theoretic categories: those that are consistent in terms of the set cardinality of objects, and those that remain identical in relation to objects.

- Section 5 proposes future research directions.

A focal point of the paper is the demonstration that a functor 'F' with consistent set-cardinality for objects is naturally equivalent to a constant, inclusion preserving functor 'G'. This is established through Lemma 4.1 and 4.2.

The paper then presents the major outcome of this section, Theorem 4.14. This theorem emerges from an inconsistency result concerning fixed points in a cartesian closed category with coproducts, which, when applied to a specific category defined in Definition 4.7, reveals significant insights regarding functorial behavior.
