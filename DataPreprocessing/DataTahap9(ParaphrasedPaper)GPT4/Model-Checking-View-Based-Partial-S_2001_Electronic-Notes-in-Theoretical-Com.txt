This academic paper addresses the issue of verifying global properties in systems that are only partially observable or understood. Here is the paraphrased version:

Our research aims to resolve practical challenges through theoretical developments in two stages. The first stage involves creating semantic and algorithmic tools to assess global properties that might include unknown symbols in a partial view of a system. The second stage focuses on orchestrating multiple partial views, utilizing communication between them to collectively verify system-wide properties. This paper specifically addresses only the first stage, with the second stage reserved for future exploration.

We propose a three-valued semantic approach that can be broken down into two distinct semantic schemes. By utilizing both schemes, we are able to reconstruct our original three-valued semantics. This method leverages formula translation into a standard form, which simplifies the process from a three-valued logic to a more conventional binary-logic model.

The paper outlines our method beginning in section 2 with the concept of partial models that have restricted access to the comprehensive set of symbols. Subsequent sections demonstrate how global terms and formulas are interpreted using these partial models, and section 4 introduces a preordering system that ranks the partial models based on their level of refinement. It confirms that our semantic approach is robust, as long as the basic elements remain constant between views.

Additionally, the paper briefly discusses related work by Bruns and Godefroid, who developed a three-valued logic for model checking in computation tree logic, emphasizing the concept of refinement and its soundness in temporal logic. Their work is extended to generalized model checking, which improves the precision of the semantics and executes checking through finite automata.

Moreover, the paper mentions an approach that addresses software specification through partial checking. This is due to the fact that problems could be over-specified when multiple specifications overlap or under-specified when property refutation fails to generate a counterexample. In such cases, their approach operates within a defined scope and acknowledges that some results might remain inconclusive within that scope.

Lastly, the work of S. Guerra is cited, who developed a framework for software specifications that accommodate defaults and exceptions due to system evolution. The framework uses temporal logic and non-monotonic semantics, with interpretations guided by a preferential ordering among models. This framework focuses on maintaining consistency in how observable actions and attributes are modeled across different versions of the system.
