As the world's population and energy demands increase, there's a growing gap in fossil fuel supply, highlighting the importance of switching to renewable energy sources (RES). Solar power, a popular form of RES, is pivotal for reducing fossil fuel reliance in national electricity generation strategies. Solar photovoltaic (PV) panels, which harvest solar energy, help alleviate environmental issues, and they are also attractive due to their simple installation, low maintenance, and suitability for both personal and industrial electricity generation.

The efficiency of PV systems is greatly influenced by the algorithm used for Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT). The performance of these algorithms can vary with shading conditions and the way panels are connected. This study examines three popular MPPT algorithms. One highlighted algorithm, the Perturb & Observe (P&O) method, adjusts the voltage of the solar array and monitors power output to find the maximum power point (MPP).

To evaluate the three MPPT algorithms under various partial shading scenarios, a prototype PV power plant system using a Processor-in-the-Loop (PIL) platform was designed. This method differs from typical simulations because it tests the algorithm on a hardware microprocessor in real-time, offering a more practical assessment. 

Under five shading patterns tested, most panel connections achieved maximum power with the diagonal gradient pattern, except for the series-parallel total cross-tied (SP-TCT) connection. This same pattern also resulted in the highest fill factor (FF) for connections, again except for the SP-TCT. Hence, the diagonal gradient pattern appears less problematic for power efficiency across the connections.

Although conventional algorithms do not pinpoint as many global maximum points as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) in all conditions, they perform comparably well under light and diagonal gradient patterns for all panel connections. Therefore, when these shading patterns are expected, the choice of MPPT algorithm and panel connection does not significantly impact performance. In such cases, selecting the least expensive connection and the simplest algorithm might be advantageous.
