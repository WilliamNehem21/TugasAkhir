In this paper, the authors provide a comprehensive analysis of resource semantics using a family of Stone-type duality theorems. These theorems cover a broad spectrum of systems, from layered graph logics and Boolean BI, to separation logic. The study extends to intuitionistic versions of these logics, and potentially to modal and epistemic systems discussed in other works.

The paper starts by explaining the classical logic of layered graphs (LGL), and its intuitionistic counterpart (iLGL), through a formal graph-theoretic definition. The layers in a directed graph are linked via specific edges that go from an upper to a lower layer.

Methodologically, the paper describes how these logics are paired with resource hyperdoctrine and indexed resource frames, offering a detailed proof in an extended research note.

The main accomplishment of the study is a systematic treatment of Stone-type duality within the structures that interpret bunched logics, ranging from basic systems to separation logic. The authors show that their results cover all known algebraic approaches to separation logic and confirm soundness with respect to standard store-heap semantics. As direct outcomes, soundness and completeness theorems for the systems under consideration are deduced.

The paper also presents similar findings for the intuitionistic variant of LGL, Boolean BI, and other systems with added multiplicative elements like negation and disjunction. The authors propose that their approach could be extended to include certain bunched modal and epistemic systems, as well as advanced variations of separation logic.

The authors speculate that their methodology could also cover the operational semantics related to program execution as described by Hoare triples. They express a desire to apply their framework to computational interpretations, like bi-abduction, within their duality-driven semantics. The aim is to see if duality theorems can introduce algebraic or topological techniques into exploring key properties of separation logic.

In conclusion, the paper suggests that using duality theorems can simplify the completeness arguments for bunched logics, offering a versatile framework that may be adapted for various nonclassical predicate logics, as well as to better understand and analyze operational semantics in computational systems.
