In an academic context related to graph theory or coloring problems, the original sentence seems to discuss a strategy for coloring edges of a graph under certain constraints. Here is a paraphrased version of the text:

"Given that vertices v1 and v4, and paths pj and p, do not share both of their endpoints, we can assume without any loss of generality that v1 is not the same as u1. Then, we assign a color to the edges u2u3 and u5u1 that has not been used previously, denoting this new color as ci1+1. If the edge v2v3 is identical to the edge u2u3, we also color the edge v5v1 with the color ci1+1. If, on the other hand, v2v3 is not the same as u2u3, we then use another new color to color both edges v2v3 and v5v1, which we denote as ci2+1."
