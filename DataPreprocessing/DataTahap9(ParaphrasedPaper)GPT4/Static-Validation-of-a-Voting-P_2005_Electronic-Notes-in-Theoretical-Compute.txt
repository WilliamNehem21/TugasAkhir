This paper investigates the critical security characteristics necessary for electronic voting protocols, focusing on verifiability, accuracy, democracy, and fairness. The authors use a static program analysis tool to assess these properties in an established voting protocol, formalized in an augmented lysa process calculus that includes blinding signatures. The automated analysis uncovers new vulnerabilities regarding verifiability and accuracy, leading the authors to propose adjustments to the protocol to address these issues.

The backdrop of the paper is the global shift towards electronic voting, powered by widespread internet access. Electronic voting offers efficiency and convenience over traditional paper voting but creates novel risks for vote manipulation and result falsification. Ensuring the integrity of these systems is paramount if they are to be accepted as replacements for conventional voting methods.

The paper describes the use of static program analysis to verify vital security properties of electronic voting systems, showcasing this approach on the FOO92 protocol, which employs Chaum's blind signaturesâ€”a cryptographic technique ensuring message confidentiality during the signing process. The analysis operates under the assumption of perfect cryptography, which holds that only the correct key can decrypt or unblind a message.

For the analysis, each message is assigned source and destination data, similar to IP addressing systems, which are easily forgeable since they are sent in plaintext. The authors simulate bit commitment and digital signatures using symmetric and asymmetric encryption, respectively, and analyze all communicated messages for potential security breaches.

The analysis includes a review of a flawed protocol between two parties, emphasizing the ability to analyze the protocol for an unrestricted number of participants, a capability of the lysa tool. This aspect allows the analysis to take into account the interference between multiple voters, administrators, and attackers.

The authors detail an attack where an attacker could potentially remain unanonymous by opting not to blind their committed vote, though still requiring validation by the administrator. They go on to discuss how the protocol ensures that only validated ballots count in the final tally and addresses the possibility of replay attacks, which is shown to be unlikely under the protocol's assumptions and unsupported by any violations reported by the lysa tool.

Privacy is another concern, where ballot anonymity is essential. The paper points out that while the lysa tool's analysis infers what an attacker could learn, it does not reveal how these data might be connected, meaning privacy validation is not directly observable through the analysis results.

In conclusion, the paper validates and exhibits the potential of static program analysis in confirming essential security properties of electronic voting protocols, with a case study on the FOO92 protocol. Adjustments to this protocol are suggested to enhance its security with respect to verifiability and accuracy, based on insights from the analysis conducted using the lysa framework.
