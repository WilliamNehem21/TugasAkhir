When a subcategory A fulfills the initial two criteria, it is classified as a complete or fully stocked subcategory within the larger category B. The corresponding left adjoint in this situation is referred to as the reflection. Additionally, if every component within the counit of the adjoint pair is an epimorphism, then A is termed an epireflective subcategory of B.
