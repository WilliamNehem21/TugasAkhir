The central objective of the research was to create eco-friendly composite materials by integrating rice straw (RS) with cornstarch-based adhesives (CA). The study explored the effects of treating RS with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and hot water on the performance of the resulting composites. It also examined how varying the density of the composites and the amount of cornstarch affected their characteristics. The researchers conducted observations on the microstructure of the composites' fractured surfaces to gain further insights.

The primary findings highlighted that composites utilizing cornstarch as an adhesive exhibited an enhanced flexural strength. Notably, the composites produced with hot-water treated RS combined with cornstarch showed superior interfacial bonding and the greatest flexural strength when the cornstarch content was at 10% and the composite density stood at 0.7 g/cm³. On the other hand, composites comprising untreated RS and cornstarch exhibited lower moisture uptake, and it was observed that moisture absorption rates increased in correlation with higher starch content and lower density.

The research suggests that composites with these specifications hold potential for use in applications such as ceiling panels and bulletin boards.

The background context indicates a growing global interest in utilizing straw and other agricultural residues for composite material manufacturing. Current materials include straw powder, rice husk powder, husk powder, or straw-derived fibers. Composites that integrate used tires, formaldehyde resins, and polymers as matrices tend to demonstrate superior water resistance, acoustic insulation, internal bond strength, flexibility, and flexural strength. However, processing agricultural residues is energy-intensive, and the matrices often used in composites are not easily degradable.

To prepare the RS for the study, it was thoroughly cleansed with distilled water to eradicate impurities, particularly dust. This process involved multiple washes at room temperature with vigorous stirring, after which the RS was dried in a ventilated oven at 103°C. The dried material was stored in airtight plastic containers to prevent microbial, particularly fungal, degradation. The RS that underwent no additional treatments after washing served as the control sample and was labeled CRS.

Cornstarch adhesive was created by dispersing cornstarch powder in distilled water at a ratio of 1:10. This mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2 hours; sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3·5H2O) was added at a concentration of 1.2% by weight relative to the dry cornstarch to prevent spoilage. This adhesive was then ready to be blended with the treated RS.
