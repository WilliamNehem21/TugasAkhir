This paper discusses the significance of human cognitive capabilities in the success of interactive systems and advocates for the application of formal methods to model human cognition, specifically focusing on how humans process and interact with rapidly presented stimuli in complex environments like cockpits or control rooms. It addresses the challenges of information overload and the phenomenon of "attentional blink," where rapid stimuli can lead to missed information. The authors have developed a model using process algebra to simulate attentional limitations and applied it to the study of Stimulus-Response-Compatibility Interfaces (SRRIs), exploring the potential to manage the presentation of information to match human cognitive processing capabilities.

The paper also examines the usability of broad cognitive frameworks in human-computer interaction and references several important cognitive models such as SOAR, ACT-R, EPIC, and Interacting Cognitive Subsystems (ICS). It considers symbolic representations in cognitive modeling due to their ease of manipulation, transparency, and hierarchical structuring.

The research investigates the effects of meaning and personal relevance on attention allocation, noting cases where certain types of stimuli, like aversive words, can alter the typical patterns seen in attentional blink. They introduce a formal model simulating the attentional process and how it represents cognitive interactions.

The paper then discusses the findings of experiments that simulate SRRIs and evaluates the performance in terms of the probability of noticing a target among rapidly presented items. It also suggests that while constructive approaches can avoid overwhelming the operator, they may slow down the presentation rate and do not improve performance beyond a basic condition.

Looking forward, the authors propose investigating reactive approaches, such as using EEG signals, to improve SRRIs by providing faster feedback on the operator's attentional state and potentially re-presenting missed stimuli, and they explore the feasibility of incorporating such features in real-time through compact, wearable devices.

Lastly, the paper implies that future work could expand this formal model to mimic EEG feedback, which could aid in understanding the efficacy of interfaces that use such physiological signals to ensure stimuli are perceived by users.
