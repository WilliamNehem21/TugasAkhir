The paper explores the application of Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) and their extensions, which are valuable in the quantitative analysis of complex systems. A variety of methods have been developed to produce symbolic representations of state graphs (SGs) from high-level models with compositional efficiency being key. Once a potential SG is determined through symbolic composition, a reachability analysis must be conducted on symbolic data structures. This analysis step is the most demanding in terms of CPU time and memory during symbolic SG creation. The authors present a new operator for zero-suppressed BDDs (ZDDs) and their extensions, which performs partitioned symbolic reachability analysis. This operator not only supersedes traditional BDD techniques but arguably renders symbolic composition, as utilized in existing symbolic model checkers like PRISM and CASPA, unnecessary.

The paper gives a thorough view on techniques for symbolic reachability analysis and computing relational products, specifically employing BDDs and ZBDDs, respectively. It unveils algorithms that integrate conjunction and existential quantification into one process. The authors' approach differs in SG generation and thus presents a novel algorithm. Their work builds on high-level modeling methods and compositionally structured transition relations, allowing an algorithm that does not need the insertion of identity structures for sub-model-independent state variables when combining transition relations.

The paper structure is outlined as follows: Section 2 provides background on decision diagrams. Section 3 introduces the new symbolic reachability algorithm, and Section 4 evaluates its practicality using standard benchmark models from the literature. The paper concludes with Section 5.

A challenge in shared BDD environments is ZDD node uniqueness, which is compromised when represented functions vary in input variables. To address this, Partially Shared ZDDs (PZDDs) and algorithms for their manipulation were developed. PZDDs operate on ZDDs with different input variables by iterating over input variables of operand PZDDs, which assigns specific semantics to each variable encountered on the current path.

When representing a local transition function of a (submodel/partition), only state variables (SVs) dependent on the partitionâ€™s activities are used as input variables. In recursion, if a variable is a state-variable (S-variable), it progresses into both else and then branches of the current node, creating new nodes only when necessary. If a variable is a transition-variable (T-variable), the behavior is more complex and varies during recursion. Additional adaptation is needed for activating BDDs and standard multi-terminal BDDs with regard to terminal conditions, caching, and node allocation/enumeration to conform to the proper elimination rules.

The authors detail how input and non-function variables interplay during recursion and the specificity of node allocation, demonstrating sometimes it's unnecessary to consider each variable since no node will be allocated for certain levels after returning from the recursion.

This summary has paraphrased the main concepts of the original paper to provide an overview of the research and findings while omitting technical details and specific technical terminology where simplification was feasible.
