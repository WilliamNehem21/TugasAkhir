The research paper discusses LIME, a middleware framework tailored for mobile computing that bridges both physical device mobility and logical software component mobility, providing an extensive suite of primitives for local and remote operations. However, the initial LIME design is found to be quite complicated and difficult to implement effectively. To address this, the authors propose "CoreLIME"—a simplified model with the goal of better accommodating large and dynamic systems comprised of numerous agents and hosts.

Traditional computing models are based on static deployment of devices and software, with the expectation that configurational changes are infrequent. But in the realm of wireless computing, where devices like PDAs and smartphones can establish impromptu network connections and applications can self-deploy, these static models fail. Consequently, new computational models are needed to support the fluid nature of these environments.

Existing theoretical models like Ambients and SEAL conceptualize mobile computation through the notion of mobile agents or migratory computation, which represent both physical and logical mobility of computation. However, in practice, these models struggle with the realities of mobile hosts, often falling back on traditional communication primitives, which ill serve the unique requirements of mobile agent systems.

Communicating in mobile environments poses unique challenges: communication is transient, opportunistic, and typically anonymous—reliant on services rather than entity identities. The paper aims to reinterpret LIME in order to fashion a scalable solution called CoreLIME, starting with formalizing its core concepts within a process calculus for clearer reasoning and specification.

LIME extends standard Linda primitives with a "reaction" concept, a triple containing a tuple space, a template, and a code fragment that executes atomically when a matching tuple is inserted. Transient sharing of tuple spaces is a key LIME innovation, allowing agents to merge tuple spaces as long as they co-locate. LIME also introduces the idea of federated spaces, complex shared spaces spanning multiple hosts, controlled through "engage" and "disengage" commands.

The authors then articulate the semantics of their process calculus for understanding LIME, describing a global tuple space that encapsulates all agents' tuple spaces, process primitives based on asynchronous calculus, and the approach to handling output and reactions within this model.

Implementation concerns like host joining, atomicity of moves, and simple modeling of behavior like message transmission during agent movements are addressed. CoreLIME intentionally limits operations to the local host to reduce complexity, but the authors plan to define semantics for remote operations as well.

The paper concludes with an ongoing effort to implement CoreLIME in Java while mostly retaining the LIME interface. The researchers note similarities with the ambient calculus but highlight differences in messaging primitives and transparency. They also intend to incorporate security into CoreLIME to account for the trust issues inherent in anonymous mobile communication, including secure channels, authentication, and access restriction measures.
