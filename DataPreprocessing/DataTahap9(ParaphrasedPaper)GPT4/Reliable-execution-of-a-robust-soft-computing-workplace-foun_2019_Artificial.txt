The study suggests that understanding tractor-implement systems in plowing can lead to better management of tillage equipment, thus potentially decreasing overall costs associated with crop production, repair, maintenance, and fuel. The research outcomes may inform the creation of databases for deeper multivariate analysis using detailed visual representations.

Among various soft computing techniques, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) excel as self-adaptive computational models, Fuzzy Inference Systems (FIS) use linguistically interpretable "if-then" rules, and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS) combine the benefits of both ANN and FIS. ANNs and ANFIS are particularly useful for handling complex and non-linear systems where the relationships between inputs and outputs are not fully understood.

Previous literature indicates that researchers have utilized ANFIS models to predict various output parameters by developing tailored environments for each parameter governed by a common set of inputs. This approach overcomes limitations inherent in ANFIS structures.

Fuel consumption of tractors was measured using two flow meters: one between the injector pump and fuel filter, and another between the injection pump and fuel tank, accounting for excess returned fuel. The difference in readings indicated actual fuel use.

Field tests were carried out in predetermined plots, using randomized and blocked arrangements based on a split plot design, considering plowing depth and forward speed as major and minor factors, respectively. Data on key performance indicators was collected using a digital system as machines moved between flagged points in each plot.

The ANN used for the study had three input nodes corresponding to different types of plows and ten output nodes for performance parameters. The first-order Takagi-Sugeno-Kang ANFIS model also predicted performance based on inputs of plowing depth, forward speed, and implement type, operating through five sequential layers: fuzzification, normalization, application of fuzzy rules, defuzzification, and output generation.

ANFIS's training process, similar to ANN, typically employs a hybrid algorithm combining back-propagation and least-squares methods. ANFIS automatically tunes its rules, optimizing the connections between inputs and outputs.

Results indicated a correlation between fuel consumption and the combination of treatments (plowing depth and forward speed), aligning with previous research findings. The study also explored specific fuel consumption patterns against other factors like operating hours and tilled area.

In terms of machine performance, ANN models could not definitively establish relationships with the implement type (a nominal variable), suggesting that neuro-fuzzy strategies, leveraging both neural and fuzzy system advantages, might better uncover complex connections.

The research concluded that enhanced ANFIS models (MANFIS and MANFIS+MNE) successfully identified intricate relationships between various performance parameters and the studied variables, with the fuzzy rules fine-tuned through training to minimize simulation error. Results complement previous research on the impact of forward speed and plowing depth on fuel consumption and draft force.

These findings address key research questions and recommend that techniques like MANFIS+MNE and their theoretical insights be adopted by technical farming organizations for informed decision-making regarding agricultural machinery management in plowing processes.
