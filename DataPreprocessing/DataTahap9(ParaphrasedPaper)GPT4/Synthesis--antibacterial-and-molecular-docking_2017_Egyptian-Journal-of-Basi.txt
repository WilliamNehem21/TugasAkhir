New compounds that incorporate benzimidazole with triazinane and oxadiazinane rings have been developed through the aminomethylation of various aryl-N,N'-unsymmetrical thioureas. The antibacterial efficacy of these new compounds against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria was demonstrated using the well diffusion method. Promising results were observed in the form of inhibition zones. Additionally, the compounds underwent molecular docking studies with the proteins topoisomerase II (PDB ID: 1JIJ) and DNA gyrase subunit B (PDB ID: 1KZN), which supported their potential as antibacterial agents due to favorable inhibition constants and binding energies.

These heterocyclic compounds have a demonstrated capacity for biological activity, including binding effectively to enzyme receptors. An increasing interest in heterocyclic compounds for various applications has led to an expansion of related research and synthesis endeavors. The newly synthesized triazinane derivatives, including those with thione and oxo functional groups, possess antiproliferative properties and are notable for their potential applications in biocidal products and in chemistry as reagents.

The synthesis and analytical characterization of these compounds, including melting point determination, Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC), Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1H NMR), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), and elemental analysis, have been methodically carried out using standard laboratory equipment and techniques, all of which contribute to a detailed understanding of the compoundsâ€™ properties and reactive behaviors.
