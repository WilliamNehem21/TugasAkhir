Here's a paraphrased summary of the academic papers:

1. Dhanvijay et al. provided a review of IoT smart healthcare systems in WBANs, highlighting the need for secure data transmission and reception. The authors also explored issues such as privacy protection, power efficiency, strategic planning, and resource management in these healthcare systems.

2. Mahmoud et al. discussed the utilization of the Cloud of Things (CoT) in smart medical applications, specifically focusing on the enhancement of energy efficiency in smart healthcare.

3. Qi et al. investigated various IoT applications within smart healthcare, addressing the monitoring of vital signs like blood pressure and oxygen saturation. The review included an exploration of IoT technologies that support these applications, such as network connectivity and data processing.

4. Algarni et al. organized recent research on security and privacy concerns in smart healthcare according to publication venues and years. They identified common security threats, their countermeasures, and made recommendations for future research on securing smart healthcare systems.

5. Baker et al. presented a smart healthcare model capable of global health monitoring, reviewing current technologies like blood pressure sensors and smart wearables that track bodily conditions.

The paper then elaborates on 5G networks' role in smart healthcare, emphasizing that while 5G is not a new concept, it is essential for addressing network congestion and supporting IoT devices in applications like healthcare. 5G will enable various communication modes like D2D, M2M, and H2M, with a primary focus on security.

In the organization of the paper, Section 2 provides an overview of 5G smart healthcare architecture and technologies, while Section 3 creates a taxonomy for 5G healthcare security, addressing threats and security approaches. Section 4 offers solutions like blockchain and AI for 5G healthcare network security. Section 5 discusses open issues and future research directions, and the conclusion is summarized in Section 6.

The paper also notes that 5G networks will employ small cell technology, massive MIMO for greater data handling, and edge computing for more secure and efficient healthcare. It further highlights authentication methods, the requirement of non-repudiation through digital signatures, and maintaining network integrity via cryptographic algorithms. Additionally, the authors discuss vulnerabilities like spoofing and provide strategies to mitigate such risks in 5G smart healthcare.

Finally, the paper indicates ongoing challenges and areas for improvement in maintaining confidentiality, system reliability and fault tolerance, energy efficiency, and smart gateways for enhanced security.
