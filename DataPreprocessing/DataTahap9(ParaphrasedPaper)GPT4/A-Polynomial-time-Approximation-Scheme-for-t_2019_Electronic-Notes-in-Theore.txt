The paper describes how numerous online platforms, such as Google, Yahoo!, and Facebook, offer complimentary services to users while generating income through the display of advertisements. These ads are showcased in designated areas of fixed size on these websites and are rotated over time. The primary focus of the paper is to explore efficient methods to allocate advertising space and time to maximize revenue.

Additionally, the paper highlights the substantial growth of online advertising revenue, which surged to $42.78 billion in 2013, marking a 17% increase from the prior year. By 2016, it was projected that web advertising revenue in the U.S. could reach $77 billion, accounting for 35% of all advertising expenditure and surpassing TV ad spend. Banner ads made up 31.4% of internet ads, contributing to $22.7 billion in revenue. With web advertising forming a multi-billion dollar industry, advertisement scheduling algorithms have become crucial.

The concept of release dates and deadlines is considered. An ad's release date marks the start of its campaign, while the deadline signifies its conclusion. For instance, Christmas ads must be arranged before December 25th. The paper outlines the notation and concepts used in the study, introduces an algorithm for scheduling small ads, and proposes a polynomial time approximation scheme (PTAS) for managing a full set of ads.

A specific contradiction is examined where an optimal solution to an ad set (denoted as OPT) with a function value less than 1/2 is assumed, and where a 'first-fit' heuristic might not schedule the complete set. A claim is made that if an ad cannot be scheduled by the 'first-fit' algorithm within capacity limits, it results in a contradiction, indicating that the heuristic's function value would exceed that of OPT.

Furthermore, a polynomial-time maximum flow problem in a bipartite graph is used to fractionally assign ads to types, with flow amounts indicating the fraction of space an ad occupies.

In conclusion, the paper presents a PTAS for the MAXSPACE-RD problem, a variant of MAXSPACE that includes release dates and deadlines. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first approximation scheme for this variation. MAXSPACE-RD is deemed strongly NP-hard when the number of bins is part of the input, and therefore cannot have a fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS). The paper ends by acknowledging the open question of whether the problem remains hard when the number of slots is constant, and it proposes future work to study a variant where ad values are given as input and unrelated to size, likening this to the strongly NP-hard multiple knapsack problem.
