Computer vision has become integral in bridging the digital and physical worlds, often using cameras and computers to process and interpret visual information. Its importance spans multiple domains, notably in object detection, tracking, and classification.

The emergence of smart agriculture benefits from computer vision technology for tasks such as disease detection in plants, weed control, and crop yield prediction. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), or drones, also leverage computer vision to autonomously navigate and analyze farmland, providing a cost-effective and efficient alternative to traditional manual inspections.

Weeds in agriculture can impede water irrigation, hinder pesticide application, and foster pathogens, thus negatively impacting crop production and increasing farming expenses. Traditional weed control using chemicals may contribute to environmental problems and the development of herbicide-resistant weeds, while manual removal is labor-intensive and costly. Site-specific weed management (SSWM) addresses these issues by precise detection and localized treatment of weed infestations.

However, real-world application of image processing for weed detection can be challenging due to various factors. Plant leaves often overlap, causing confusion between crops and weeds, and variable lighting conditions throughout the day may affect the color representation of the vegetation.

This paper discusses the use of machine learning (ML) techniques to distinguish between crops and weeds. While traditional image processing methods like Hough transforms can also be applied, this paper focuses on using ML algorithms fed with features such as color and shape extracted from image processing techniques. Previous studies have used color co-occurrence matrix-based texture analysis.

Hyperspectral sensors, which can provide hundreds or thousands of bands, have shown potential for estimating vegetation properties but face limited availability. Image quality is impacted by environmental conditions such as lighting and humidity, and UAV position changes can further complicate image acquisition.

Regarding plant identification, techniques exploring spectral reflectance differences have proved promising, especially since plants have unique cellular characteristics that respond distinctly to specific wavelengths.

This paper also addresses the advantages of employing different ML classification algorithms for the task of crop/weed discrimination, such as k-nearest neighbor (KNN), artificial neural networks (ANNs), decision trees, and support vector machines (SVM). Ensemble learning techniques, which combine multiple learning algorithms, are highlighted for their potential to improve prediction performance.

Recent research has also begun exploring deep learning (DL) algorithms, which are advantageous in image classification tasks due to their ability to automatically extract features without human intervention. Studies have employed CNN models like SegNet for pixel-wise classification, and unsupervised approaches have been proposed to avoid the time-consuming process of manual annotation.

Datasets used in research are divided into those for segmentation and annotation, with the former typically providing a logical mask for pixel classification. Challenges in crop/weed classification involve segmentation difficulties due to complex backgrounds and the need to optimize classifier models to achieve high accuracy while preventing overfitting.

In conclusion, advancements in ML and DL algorithms are providing innovative solutions to agricultural challenges, especially in the realm of weed detection and classification, by harnessing the growing capabilities of computer vision and UAV technology.
