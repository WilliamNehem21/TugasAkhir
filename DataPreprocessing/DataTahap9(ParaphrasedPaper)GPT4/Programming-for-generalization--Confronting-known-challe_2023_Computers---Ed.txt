The study observed the design, development, and evaluation of a VR learning intervention named VIRTUOSO aimed at teaching autistic adults how to use public transportation effectively in a safe, simulated environment. The researchers tackled the challenge of transferring skills from the VR setting to real-life scenarios, as these skills are essential for independent living, such as accessing employment and community resources. 

VIRTUOSO was collaboratively created with autistic adults participating in a day program at a large Midwestern university, incorporating design features to enhance learning and skill generalization. Despite the absence of ready-made VR tools for public transportation, the team developed VIRTUOSO with multiple stages to gradually introduce fewer prompts and more realistic environmental details, moving from virtual to real-world practice.

Data were gathered through field notes, video analysis, and one-way within-subjects ANOVA to measure task completion times and session lengths across varying stages of training. The study also included semi-structured interviews for thematic analysis of participants' perceptions of VR attributes compared to the real world.

Results showed participants completed most tasks consistently across VR and real-world sessions. Discrepancies existed in participants' perceptions of humanoid avatars in terms of their realism. The study highlighted the importance of deliberately designing VR environments to facilitate generalization of learned skills to real-life settings, which is not guaranteed without such intentionality.

The researchers noted that while VR is considered promising for autism interventions, the technology is still maturing, and challenges like integration into real-world contexts, overcoming cybersickness, and maintaining up-to-date systems complicate its use. They proposed that collaborations with software development studios might overcome some hurdles observed in VR development for autistic users, citing the successful commercial VR system Floreo as an example.

Overall, the study contributes to the modest body of evidence supporting skill generalization from VR to real life for autistic individuals, emphasizing the need for more rigorous research and innovative designs to realize VR's full potential in autism interventions.
