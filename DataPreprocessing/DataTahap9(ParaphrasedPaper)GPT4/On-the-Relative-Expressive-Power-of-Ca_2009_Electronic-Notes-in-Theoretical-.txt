In this study, we investigate the expressive capabilities of different programming languages by attempting to translate one language into another, while adhering to some well-defined properties that we consider essential for a meaningful comparison. Too lenient a definition of these properties would render most translations possible and thus trivialize our findings while overly restrictive criteria would lead to very few successful translations.

We specify criteria that encodings must satisfy in order to be considered valid. The properties we require are compositionality, name invariance (meaning that encoding processes with different free names should retain these differences), and operational correspondence, among others. We take inspiration from a particular proposal and apply it throughout our research.

Our paper is organized into sections, with Section 4 dedicated to establishing a hierarchy of languages based on the possibility of encoding one into another, providing encodability or separation results for each pair of languages examined. We conclude in Section 5 by summarizing our findings and relating our work to other studies in the field. In this synopsis, we omit the rationale behind the languages studied, which can be found in more detail in the original publications.

We note that our investigation doesn't depend on certain simplifications made for clarity, such as the handling of legal migrations within a computational network without a type system which was addressed in the original research.

In discussing specific languages, we mention the boxed ambient calculus (BA), which evolved from the mobile ambients calculus (MA) by removing the "open" action deemed excessively powerful and introducing controlled non-local communication between ambients. Only well-typed processes from these languages, as defined in previous work, are considered for consistency.

An encoding is defined as a translation between two languages that satisfies a set of five key properties, which are intended to ensure the quality of the translation. To define one such property, compositionality, we use k-ary contexts, representing terms with k holes that can accommodate other terms.

For space reasons, we do not include the proof that our presented translation fulfills the established properties, but interested readers are directed to the full discussion in the referenced work.

In summary, our research successfully organizes various ambient-like languages into a hierarchy based on their relative expressive powers. We extend our comparison to include several dialects that have emerged in recent years, assessing these in relation to the original languages they were derived from.
