In this study, a computer system where two types of jobs, grid jobs and local jobs, vie for the same computational resources is analyzed. Local jobs are deemed more important, and the system aims to provide efficient service to both without causing undue delays to local jobs. To manage these competing jobs, the system uses various scheduling strategies.

The computer system in question comprises two similar clusters, each equipped with 16 processors and a local scheduler, along with a shared, overarching grid scheduler that manages a separate queue. All processors are identical in performance and are linked through fast local and wide-area networks. The workload is divided into local jobs (single tasks) and grid jobs (or "gangs"), which contain multiple tasks requiring simultaneous execution—ranging from 2 to 16 tasks, averaging 7.5 tasks per gang. The job arrival time follows an exponential distribution.

Local jobs are prioritized, and strategies like backfilling are implemented to reduce their waiting time while ensuring grid jobs are not neglected. When a grid job arrives, the grid scheduler decides whether it goes directly to processing or awaits its turn in a queue, based on processor availability and the need for simultaneous task execution.

The study examines three distinct scheduling methods for handling grid jobs, aiming to minimize delays for local jobs—a crucial aspect since large grid jobs can obstruct local job processing if a simple first-come-first-served method is used.

The models were simulated using discrete event simulation and independent replications, averaging results from 10 simulations with various random number seeds to ensure robustness. Each simulation run accounted for the completion of 40,000 jobs.

The findings of the study indicate that the second scheduling approach delivers optimal performance, completing a high percentage of grid jobs without markedly impeding local jobs, across different workloads. Additional experiments factored in overhead from routing grid jobs to multiple clusters, revealing that lower overhead improved performance. Different thresholds for backfilling jobs were tested, and a zero threshold emerged as the best option, leading to satisfactory performance for both grid jobs and local jobs.

This work is summarized from the paper titled "Performance Evaluation of Gang Scheduling in a Two-Cluster System with Migrations," by Z. Papazachos and H. D. Karatza, presented at the 8th International Workshop on Performance Modeling, Evaluation, and Optimization of Ubiquitous Computing and Network Systems (PMEO-UCNS 2009) alongside the IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS) held in Rome, Italy, from May 25-29, 2009.
