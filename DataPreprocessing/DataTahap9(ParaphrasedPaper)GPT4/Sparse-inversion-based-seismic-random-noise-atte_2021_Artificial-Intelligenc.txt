In this academic paper, the authors address the challenges of seismic data collection in the Loess Plateau of the Ordos Basin in northwest China, a region with complex topography covered by a thick layer of quaternary loess, which introduces substantial noise into 3D seismic data used for oil and gas exploration. This noise negatively affects the processing and interpretation of seismic signals, necessitating research into improving the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

The paper is structured to first provide an overview of sparse theory before introducing a new model for reducing random noise, called SRNA-SPL-MN. To solve the model, an effective optimization algorithm based on the split Bregman method is applied, yielding accurate filtering results. The effectiveness of the proposed noise reduction workflow is then demonstrated using both synthetic and real post-stack field data.

In the process of sample selection, the Sparse Learning (SPL) model is described, outlining that it initially selects "easy" samples and, as the "age" parameter increases, incorporates increasingly complex samples. This allows for automatic adaptation compared to conventional learning (CL) methods.

However, the paper also notes potential areas for improvement. Specifically, the introduction of three regularization terms in the proposed noise reduction model necessitates extensive experimentation to fine-tune these parameters. While the proposed method enhances performance in seismic data denoising, optimizing the selection of regularization parameters remains an important task. Currently, the model solely focuses on reducing seismic random noise, but the approach could potentially be expanded to address both seismic data reconstruction and noise reduction simultaneously. Additionally, future work could explore removing coherent noise from seismic data to further improve the reliability of the exploration process.
