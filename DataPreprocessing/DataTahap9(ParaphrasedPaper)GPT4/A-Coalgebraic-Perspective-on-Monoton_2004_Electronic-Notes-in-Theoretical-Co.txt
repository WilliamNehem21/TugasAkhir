The primary advantage of using coalgebraic semantics for modal logic is that it offers a uniform approach to derive results for various types of modal logics, which are categorized by the endofunctor T. Research has been conducted on Kripke polynomial functors, as well as on general endofunctors. The paper also gives an overview of the main ideas and findings from the algebraic duality theory specific to monotone modal logic, which helps in understanding its connection to the UPV-functor. The proof mentioned references lemma 5.2.6 from Marx's work and is based on the concept of bisimulation products and the fundamental relationship between Kripke frames and Boolean algebra modal operators, adapted for monotone frames and their algebraic counterparts.
