The paper introduces a novel method for program verification that utilizes a proof-assistant. This method automatically converts programs into tail-recursive functions within the logic of a theorem prover, which is an improvement over traditional Hoare logic and verification condition generation (VCG) systems, as it does not require manual annotation with assertions. This makes the verification process more natural for the theorem prover and simplifies the implementation compared to trusted VCG tools. The implementation has been carried out in the HOL4 theorem prover.

The authors build upon the work by Camilleri and Melham, who defined a big-step operational semantics within HOL for such programs. The paper deals with states represented as finite partial functions that map string-type variable names to integer values. They describe 'neval' and 'beval' as functions to evaluate numerical and boolean expressions, respectively.

Regarding assignments, they are realized by a 'let' expression within the functional representation. For example, an assignment operation that adds the value of 'a' to variable 'b' is interpreted as 'let b = a + b in (a,b)'. A theorem is presented to encapsulate this concept.

In the context of using a VCG to verify a program, one would typically begin by annotating the program with assertions including a precondition, postcondition, loop invariant, and loop variant to achieve a total-correctness specification. In the case of the paper's approach, 'n' would be a logical variable representing the initial value of variable 'n'.

The paper credits the work of McCarthy on representing imperative programs as recursive functions as being instrumental in their approach. Additionally, they have incorporated concepts from separation logic to assist in automation by keeping specifications clear of side conditions and have drawn upon ideas related to decompilation into HOL to handle loops. The proof-assistant designed by the authors functions within the HOL4 theorem prover programming environment.
