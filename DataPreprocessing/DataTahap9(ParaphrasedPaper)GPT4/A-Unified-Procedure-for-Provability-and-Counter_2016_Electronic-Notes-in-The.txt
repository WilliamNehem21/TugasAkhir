Our research on theorem proving technology indicates significant opportunities for advancement. Future endeavors should focus on creating and integrating user-defined strategies that supplement the inherent strategies of the theorem prover. This would allow users to tailor the proving process to their specific needs and preferences. Enhancing the user interface and the interaction experience with the system also presents avenues for improvement.
