Multi-languages are created by combining existing programming languages, allowing for substitutions across different languages. For example, one multi-language enables programmers to interchangeably use ML and Scheme expressions, which offers the potential for code reuse and better interoperability between software systems. To manage how values are transferred between the core languages, these multi-languages introduce specialized functions known as boundary functions.

An important characteristic of such multi-languages is the regularity of their type signatures. Regularity guarantees that for each term created from a signature, there is a unique minimal type. Signatures discussed in the paper are all considered regular.

An order-sorted theory, denoted as TH, is paired with a signature SG and a set of axioms AX. An SG-algebra, A, that satisfies the axioms AX is referred to as a model of the theory TH. The categorization of these models, named OSMOD(C, I)TH, is a specific subset of the broader category OSALG(C, I)SG, which includes all models of TH within the context (C, I).

For any given multi-language signature SG, the collection of related SG-algebras and the homomorphisms between them form a distinct category, denoted as MLALG(C, I)SG. The paper suggests a straightforward relationship between this category and OSALG(C, I)SG, which is detailed in Theorem 3.7, using a practical example.

The regularity and coherence of a multi-language signature SG are measured concerning its core associated signatures SG1 and SG2. SG is considered regular (respectively, coherent) if SG1 and SG2 are both regular (respectively, coherent).

Although the paper uses a simple example to demonstrate the concepts for clarity, the authors acknowledge its limitations and suggest a more intricate example is given in an extended version of the paper.

Complementing theoretical insights, the researchers are also focused on applying these concepts in practice and are exploring the implementation of their examples within the Maude system. They believe that practical experimentation can enhance theoretical understanding.
