This study investigates the preparation and potential application of mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN) with large, adjustable, and open cylindrical pores to combat fungal infections, specifically Alternaria solani which causes early blight in tomatoes. Laboratory and greenhouse conditions were used to test the effectiveness of MSN and compare it with the commonly used fungicide metalaxyl.

The MSN materials were sourced from Sigma-Aldrich Company (USA) while metalaxyl, known commercially as Metalaxyl 25% EC, was obtained from Nanjing Essence Fine-Chemical Co., Ltd., via the Agricultural Development Co., Ltd. in Cairo, Egypt. Analytical-grade chemicals were utilized without any additional purification.

Characterization of MSNs was performed with the aid of a Hitachi S-4300 microscope for field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and a Bruker AMX-500 spectrometer for 29Si magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (29Si MAS NMR).

The antifungal effectiveness of both MSN and metalaxyl was assessed in the lab by measuring the inhibition percentage of A. solani's growth compared to a control treatment. The tested medium was potato dextrose agar (PDA) in Petri dishes with a central inoculation point for a five-day-old culture of A. solani.

It was noted that MSNs have beneficial properties, such as a high surface area (489 m²/g) and a small pore size (10.7), which could enhance their interaction with cells and produce a cytotoxic effect on the early blight fungus. Smaller particles typically offer a greater surface area, resulting in a stronger antimicrobial impact.

The researchers indicated that controlling plant pathogens should both manage diseases and support plant growth and yield. MSN treatment led to an increase in tomato growth parameters, likely because it reduced early blight damage on leaves, allowing for more effective photosynthesis.

For field application, the study estimated that one acre (4046.85 m²) might need approximately 40 grams of MSN, which is comparable in effect and cost to the tested fungicide amount of 30 grams per acre.

Regarding safety, MSNs have been deemed non-harmful to human cells in previous studies, suggesting they could be a safe alternative to chemical fungicides, especially since the MSNs' non-specific mode of action against A. solani could generalize its use against various pathogens.

Ultimately, MSNs show promise in reducing early blight disease severity in tomatoes and boosting growth, anticipating that low concentrations could be environmentally friendly and lower farming costs. The straightforward synthesis process of MSNs supports ongoing research into developing other metal oxides with potent antifungal capabilities, potentially offering safer alternatives to chemical fungicides for controlling tomato early blight.
