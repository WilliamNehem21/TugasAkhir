This paper introduces a new numerical simulation approach to model two-dimensional airflow across complex terrain for use in flight dynamics engineering. Utilizing potential flow theory, the methodology accounts for terrain impacts on airflow by solving for the strengths of a series of two-dimensional vortices informed by ground boundary conditions. To assess the proposed method, it was applied to numerical examples and the outcomes were compared with those derived from existing techniques.

To represent complex terrain profiles accurately, these profiles can be detailed by a cubic spline curve. The computational process detailed in the study is straightforward and efficient, producing wind field results with substantial precision. This grants the approach practical application potential in flight principle evaluation and simulation.

Terrain is modeled by discretizing its profile into a series of straight-line segments, placing a vortex at the quarter-point of each segment, and implementing actual boundary conditions at the three-quarter point. The aggregate of these induced vortex velocities allows for terrain representation in the wind field. When there's no terrain to consider, a uniform free stream represents the unperturbed wind field.

Comparatively, the flow over an isolated mountain has been previously approximated using ideal flow around a cylinder, with limitations in terrain shape modeling requiring manual adjustments for more accurate representation. In contrast, the flow around a cylinder can be computed by superposing two core potential flow solutions: the doublet and the uniform stream.

The paper concludes with a validation of the new numerical simulation approach for modeling two-dimensional airflow over complex terrain, emphasizing its simplicity, efficiency, and accuracy. The method stands out for its potential use in evaluating flight principles and in flight simulations.
