The academic paper introduces and examines the concept of a z-abstract basis, detailing its characteristics and demonstrating its relevance to the field of domain theory. A z-abstract basis is proposed as a generalization within the framework of a z-subset system, an extension of directed set systems. The study establishes that for a subset system that is union-complete, the basis of a z-continuous partially ordered set (poset) can be regarded as a z-abstract basis when the z-relation is restricted accordingly. Moreover, the paper shows that performing a rounded z-ideal completion (a completion method in domain theory) on a z-abstract basis creates a structure that is isomorphic to the original z-continuous poset, meaning that these two structures can be mapped onto each other in a manner that preserves their respective orderings and operations.

Furthermore, the research underscores the significance of an abstract basis in the context of continuous posets and extends this to the z-subset system, inviting further investigation into the relationships between these mathematical structures. It is implied that many established theorems in domain theory have found associated results within this generalized z-subset system.

Overall, the paper aims to deepen the understanding of domain theory by exploring the z-abstract basis, demonstrating that the rounded z-ideal completion of such a basis results in a z-continuous poset, and conversely, that every z-continuous poset can be seen as the rounded z-ideal completion of its z-abstract basis. The research thereby expands the theoretical foundation and offers potential new avenues for exploration within the field.
