In a study of the Nix package manager's expression language and its evaluation, the authors dive into how packages are instantiated and how laziness is exploited for efficiency. Here's a paraphrased summary of the key points:

To instantiate a package in Nix, functions such as 'hellofun' must be called. At a certain step (point 3), calling this function with the right arguments—which can be conveniently sourced from the current scope using 'inherit'—produces a build graph, here assigned to a variable named 'hello'. The 'inherit' keyword is a shorthand for passing an argument that retains the same name and value from the current lexical scope.

This function-based approach accommodates multiple instances of a package with differing arguments. For example, using a different version of Perl, one could create a variation of the 'hello' package by passing in 'perl6' as an argument to 'hellofun'.

The paper underscores the lazy nature of the Nix language, where expressions and the build graphs they translate into are only evaluated and constructed when explicitly required. The paper does not intend to fully explore Nix or its expression language, instead focusing on specific aspects; comprehensive details can be discovered in existing documentation.

The document also looks at conditional expressions, substitution in expressions, and the desugaring of recursive attribute sets into regular ones. Notably, in recursive attribute sets, only the recursive attributes have a variable-binding effect.

A term-rewriting strategy is applied to convert semantic rules into an efficient interpreter that leverages maximum laziness. This design gives rise to certain 'free' optimizations typical in functional programming, such as avoiding redundant computations of the same expression.

Lastly, the paper compares a maximal laziness implementation with traditional sharing in functional language implementations. It highlights that a simple technique called "closed term optimization" vastly improves performance in the maximally lazy Nix expression evaluator, making operations like 'nix-env-qa' run quickly and more efficiently than in package managers without a programming language for package descriptions. This optimized approach is employed in the production version of Nix.
