The study explores the Mizar system's compatibility with mathematicians' work habits by examining the language's design and its challenges. Mizar, a pioneer in formal mathematics creation, faces scrutiny on whether its language features support or hamper its adoption. The researchers set out to construct a grammar for Mizar with the aim of parsing its extensive mathematical library, uncovering issues that may deter mathematicians from using it.

Managing mathematical knowledge involves converting various mathematical expressions – whether written, symbolic, or based on conventions – into a universally compatible format. Key to this is translating existing math into an internationally consistent framework. To enrich mathematical knowledge repositories, it's essential that mathematicians can contribute in a formal language, either creating or reproducing their work in this format with ease.

A study by Wiedijk offers insights into various formal systems by comparing formal proofs from 15 key systems, showcasing their distinctive capabilities and limitations. Mizar interests researchers for practical reasons: its availability on different operating systems, ease of installation, and the rich resources on its website. Learning Mizar typically warrants mentorship from experienced users, hinting at complex, unique aspects within the language.

To objectively assess the Mizar language, the study crafted a grammar based on the language's description, using JavaCC for compiler construction. The complexity of Mizar's grammar, with over 150 productions and 93 keywords, poses a challenge, but the intricacy of a language arises more from semantics than syntax.

The study identifies issues like bracketing, which can confuse the parser due to overloading, and inconsistencies between the findvoc utility and the Mizar Math Library (MML). Even though Mizar has some distinct characteristics, the authors argue that the richness and flexibility of its language is a necessary compromise for expressing mathematical thought, which is inherently complex and nuanced.

Some MML resources appear outdated, which might limit long-term usability. The Mizar language's adaptability makes it practical but compromises its application as a formal mathematical foundation, with certain aspects proving difficult to reconstruct. This predicament raises considerations for the dual demand of human and computer readability in a single language.

Ultimately, there could be two paths: adapting Mizar (or another language) to be more intuitive for mathematicians while retaining formal rigor, or creating dual languages – one optimized for mathematicians' practical use and one for formal repositories. Translation systems could then ensure mathematician-generated content maintains its formal integrity within the broader repository and render parts of the repository into formats usable by mathematicians.
