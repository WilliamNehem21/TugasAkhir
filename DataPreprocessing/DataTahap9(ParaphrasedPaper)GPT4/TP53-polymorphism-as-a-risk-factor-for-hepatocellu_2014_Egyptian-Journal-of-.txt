Background and Objectives: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is widely prevalent and is significantly influenced by genetic factors, including polymorphisms in the TP53 gene, which is critical in tumor suppression. The study sought to explore the role of the Arg72Pro polymorphism of TP53 on the risk of developing HCC in patients chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) across various stages of liver disease.

Participants and Methods: The research involved 69 patients with HCC, 101 with liver cirrhosis (LC), and 46 healthy, age-matched controls, all from Egypt. The patients with HCC and LC were infected with HCV. An analysis of the Arg72Pro polymorphism at the TP53 gene's codon 72 utilized polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) techniques.

TP53 encodes a regulatory protein critical for genome integrity. The protein p53, produced by the gene, binds DNA and induces p21 protein expression, which inhibits cell division-protein CDK2, providing a tumor suppressant function. Given this pivotal role, TP53 polymorphisms—specifically the codon 72 Arg72Pro (with the SNP ID rs1042522)—are of particular interest in cancer research for their potential impact on HCC risk when associated with HCV infection.

The study took place in a hospital setting from January 2012 to March 2013. Informed consent was obtained, and local ethical and scientific committees granted approval. Participants included 69 newly diagnosed HCC patients, 101 cirrhosis patients without HCC, and 46 healthy controls. Diagnostic procedures included sonography, high-resolution contrast CT, and liver biopsy with histological evaluations. Patients were treatment-naive and had no other cancer diagnoses. The 101 LC patients were confirmed not to have HCC via histological or a combination of clinical, laboratory, and endoscopic methods.

Significance: This study tackles the urgent need to discover molecular markers for HCC to predict disease progression and develop new treatments with the understanding that HCC development hinges on numerous factors, including TP53 gene inactivation, typically due to mutations. Approaches to restore TP53 function in cancer cells include expressing functional TP53 or reactivating mutant TP53. Although some studies report overexpression of TP53 in HCC, contradicting results suggest complexities across HCC's multiple stages of development. Preliminary results indicate that TP53 may be overexpressed in the early stages but downregulated in the later stages of HCC compared to healthy tissues. The study suggests increasing the sample size and detailed staging for clearer insights.
