The paper discusses the significance of information hiding techniques for protecting sensitive data, particularly when transmitted over digital communication networks. It emphasizes that these techniques offer unique advantages over encryption, largely due to their ability to conceal data within other media, making the hidden information less detectable to potential attackers.

In response to advancements in detection methods that threaten to expose such hidden data, the paper recommends combining encryption with hiding techniques to bolster security. The proposed method involves dispersing secret data across multiple digital WAV audio files randomly, using a circular, randomly generated secret key known to both the sender and recipient. This strategy significantly increases the resilience of the method, making it difficult for unwanted parties to suspect or recover hidden data.

The paper further explains that steganography, specifically the practice of hiding information within audio files (such as WAV, MP3, and WMA), can maintain the appearance of normal audio files while secretly carrying additional information. Unlike encrypted files which may raise suspicion, hidden files tend to evade detection and thereby do not arouse suspicion.

It also underscores the importance of altering the audio files in a manner that remains undetectable to the human auditory system (HAS). The paper reviews several existing audio hiding techniques, including least significant bit (LSB), echo hiding, and spread spectrum approaches, which leverage characteristics of the HAS to conceal data without noticeable disruption.

Finally, the paper elaborates on the proposed technique for 16-bit uncompressed WAV audio files. In this method, secret data is concealed by modifying the two least significant bits of each audio sample within a file. This allows for a hiding capacity of 12.5% of the carrier audio file's total size without perceptibly affecting the quality of the original audio content.
