The paper describes the creation of a tool for developing visual programming environments, which is similar to compiler-compilers for text-based programming languages. This tool assists in constructing domain-specific visual languages by translating visual schema representations into both textual format and executable programs that capture the schemas' deep meaning. To achieve this, attribute grammars are employed, with attribute dependencies realized through Java class methods. This system differs from text-based compiler-compilers in that it places a significant emphasis on interactive visual language use.

The authors' innovation is a compiler-compiler tailored for visual languages that focuses on schema languages with a well-defined abstract syntax. By doing this, they are able to define both the syntax and the semantics of the languages precisely. The semantics allow for the creation of an accurate textual representation of the visual schemas, ensuring no critical information is lost. Moreover, the tool introduces a general approach for describing deep semantics to capture the underlying meaning of the schemas.

CocoVila, the system introduced in the paper, shares similarities with other meta-modeling tools such as MetaEdit or Atom3 but handles schema semantics differently. CocoVila dynamically evaluates attributes of the syntactic graph that represents the schema.

An application example is provided, illustrating how the tool is used to compute loads and kinematics within a gearbox model. Users can interact with the model through a graphical interface to add objects and connections, with pop-up windows facilitating the instantiation and manipulation of object attributes, as well as the arrangement of the schema.

For managing complex visual schemas, the paper suggests using hierarchical compositions, where a large schema is constructed from a hierarchy of nested sub-schemas. This approach allows for different abstraction levels, which simplifies the understanding and manipulation of different parts of the schema according to specific needs.
