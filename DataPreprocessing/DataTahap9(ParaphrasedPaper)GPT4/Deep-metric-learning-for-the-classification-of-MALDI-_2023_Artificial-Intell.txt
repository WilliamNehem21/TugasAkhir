Deep learning techniques show promising benefits in mass spectral classification, particularly in the areas of parallel signal correction and feature extraction. Deep metric learning (DML) models introduce an advantage by combining metric learning's capacity for assessing similarities or differences in mass spectra with deep learning's robust feature extraction capabilities. The two predominant DML models are Siamese Neural Networks (SNN) and Triplet Neural Networks (TNN), both featuring multiple neural networks with parallel architecture.

In this study, we applied SNNs and TNNs for taxonomic categorization of two groups of previously-validated mass spectra from 30 species of neotropical arthropods within the Culicidae and Ixodidae families. These species include vectors of diseases, making their identification crucial for public health. The algorithms demonstrated high efficiency, classifying 826 spectra from 12 mosquito species and 310 spectra from 18 hard tick species with minimal average loss during cross-validation. For tick and mosquito identification, SNNs achieved accuracy rates of 91.22% and 94.46%, respectively, while TNNs achieved 93% and 99%.

Our findings underscore the practicality and precision of deep metric learning as a machine learning tool for timely and accurate classification of MALDI-TOF generated mass spectra, particularly for arthropods relevant to public health in the neotropical region.

This study also acknowledges limitations, such as the use of field-collected biological samples, which poses challenges in classification due to contaminants like host blood or pathogens. The study explicitly highlights the effect of differing sample storage methods on algorithm reliability, contrasting fresh, dry-frozen mosquito samples with ticks preserved in ethanol and frozen for years before processing.
