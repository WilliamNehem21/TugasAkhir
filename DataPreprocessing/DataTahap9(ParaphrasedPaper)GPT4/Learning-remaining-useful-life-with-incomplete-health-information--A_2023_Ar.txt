This study aims at advancing condition-based predictive maintenance systems by creating models that can predict battery wear before failure occurs. Building on previous work that introduced an empirical risk minimization-based approach, the current study develops steady-state models to estimate the remaining useful life (RUL) of batteries.

This extended research addresses a broader range of issues compared to the initial publication, demonstrating application to battery health diagnostics as a case study. The paper is structured to first present the theoretical foundation, then a specific application to battery degradation, followed by empirical testing on actual and simulated batteries. The final section summarizes the findings and the appendix provides extra context on battery degradation mechanisms.

The paper discusses how battery terminal voltage, influenced by the lithium-ion content in electrodes, is crucial for understanding battery state. The study uses a simulated battery validation approach, before applying the method to real batteries to showcase how training data subsets impact diagnostic outcomes.

For the experiment, a synthetic 5 Ah battery with an NMC (nickel, manganese, and cobalt) positive electrode and a graphite and silicon negative electrode was used. The simulation helps to validate the learning algorithm and compare its performance to uninformed learning techniques.

The findings suggest that models with informed learning strategies, particularly the optimistic approach, are more accurate. The optimistic variant performs well as it is resistant to coarse data, while other approaches seek to minimize risk in less relevant phases of the battery cycle.

Additionally, the paper examines various machine learning strategies in non-destructive battery condition diagnosis. The proposed model accounts for imprecision in data and physical knowledge, suggesting that parameter estimation is dependent on selecting the appropriate training subset as a critical element of the learning algorithm. Three solutions are proposed, with the optimistic criterion, which selects subsets for the best fit, appearing more favorable for diagnostics.

The paper also explores the primary types of battery degradation: loss of lithium inventory (LLI) and loss of active material (LAM). LAM can occur in different ways, depending on the electrode and its state of lithiation. Six specific types of LAM are identified in batteries with blended graphite and silicon negative electrodes.

Degradation can manifest as capacity fade or power fade, with the latter being affected by increased ohmic resistance or decreased faradaic reaction rates. These issues can impact current flow, increase heat losses, and reduce battery efficiency.

By merging data-based and physical knowledge in an imprecise context, this study presents a sophisticated approach to choosing advantageous data subsets, demonstrating an informed learning methodology capable of improving diagnostics and correctly predicting battery RUL.
