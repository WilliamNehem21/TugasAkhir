Ontology-based semantic validation is an automated verification and validation (V&V) process. It involves converting metamodels and domain-specific models into the ontology domain to examine the coherence and integrity of metamodels and to validate models against various correctness criteria, such as adherence to the metamodel and fulfillment of supplementary constraints.

Assessing the availability and safety quantitatively must align with standards via probability-based calculations. This involves creating a dependability modelâ€”a detailed stochastic activity network that depicts the failure patterns of system components, their interaction and error linkage as per the architecture, and the integrated error recognition and correction strategies. This model is built from smaller sub-models of system components, their interactions, and mechanisms. Though dependability specialists define these sub-models, an automated tool can assemble them based on the UML (Unified Modeling Language) structure of the DMI (Driver Machine Interface). The analysis of the dependability model yields both the system availability and dangerous failure rate, which is required to stay below a specified threshold (tolerable hazard rate, THR).

Although service-oriented systems do not typically face the strict certification standards of embedded systems, certain domains like banking have specific safety criteria. Deep semantic analysis of service orchestration can confirm that these criteria are met. The SENSORIA project provides a comprehensive set of model-based formal analysis capabilities for this purpose.

The DIANA project represents the initial phase in the development of the AIDA (Architecture for Independent Distributed Avionics) platform, which offers secure distribution and the execution of avionic applications on virtual machines. The DIANA project further contributes to outlining and standardizing model-driven system development and certification practices to support the AIDA platform. It is essential to realize that the development methods envisioned for AIDA are derived from the ideas introduced by the DECOS toolchain.
