The paper discusses the use of bicategories and how their axioms have a clear topological interpretation, which can be cumbersome from an algebraic point of view. However, these interpretations become straightforward when handled with graphical calculus, hinting at a profound connection between topological structures and information theory that merits further investigation.

Graphical diagrams used in the paper depict public information as shaded regions, computational processes as vertices, and computational systems that transmit information as lines. If a line is adjacent to a shaded area, it carries a copy of that public information; if not, it carries private information. Dashed vertical lines suggest a division of components between two entities, Alice and Bob, and are interpreted rather than being a formal part of the mathematical structure.

The history of a computational system's trajectory through space is represented as a line in diagrams that lack shaded regions, with vertices marking interactions. These diagrams align with the standard notation for morphisms in symmetric monoidal categories. They value string diagrams within REL, the symmetric monoidal category of finite sets and relations, which helps model classical computational systems and nondeterministic computational dynamics.

The paper describes operations where public information either splits or merges, and only continues if the merging data matches. Through an abstract representation of these operations, the authors can infer security properties relevant to any protocol implementation. The results assume an attacker could have limitless computational capabilities but their actions are still describable by the formalism of nondeterministic processes.

A proof is provided by construction; it details how to create a solution for secure communication using a set of one-time pads and robust encryption/decryption methods, establishing a bidirectional correspondence.

The communication protocol starts with established public information, prepares two correlated systems using a one-time pad, manipulates one copy with a data-dependent procedure, and generates two ciphertexts. Both ciphertexts are consumed, producing new public information, which is deemed successful if it replicates the initial public information.
