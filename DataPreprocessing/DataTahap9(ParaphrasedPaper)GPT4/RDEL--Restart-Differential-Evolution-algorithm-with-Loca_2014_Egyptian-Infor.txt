This research paper introduces the Restart Differential Evolution algorithm with Local Search Mutation (RDEL), which is a novel modification of the traditional Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm designed for solving global numerical optimization problems over continuous space. The RDEL incorporates a local mutation rule inspired by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) that utilizes the position of the best and worst individuals in a population. This new mutation rule is integrated with the basic DE mutation through a linearly decreasing function, promoting enhanced local search capability and faster convergence.

To maintain diversity and prevent premature convergence or stagnation, the authors propose a restart mechanism combining a random mutation scheme with a modified form of Breeder Genetic Algorithm (BGA) mutation. Additionally, the paper introduces an increasing crossover probability rule and uniform scaling factors for DE to further enhance population diversity and the overall search process.

The performance of RDEL is rigorously evaluated against standard DE and state-of-the-art adaptive DE variants by using a set of 14 high-dimensional benchmark functions. The results indicate that RDEL outperforms the basic DE algorithm and is competitive with other advanced algorithms in terms of solution quality, efficiency, and robustness. The paper contextualizes this advancement alongside other self-adapting DE algorithms such as jDE, SDE, and EPSDE, which have shown promising results by encoding and evolving control parameter settings or applying ensemble approaches.

This RDEL algorithm is especially effective due to its dual capability for global exploration and local exploitation, made possible by the novel mutation scheme that takes direction from the best and worst performing individuals in the population. The restart mechanism serves as a safeguard against common pitfalls like premature convergence by providing strategic mutations when required.
