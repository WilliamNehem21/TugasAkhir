This academic paper explains the adjustments made to financial data for a DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis) study. Negative values were offset with fixed amounts to ensure all data started from zero, following the methodology of previous DEA studies like those mentioned by Pastor & Ruiz (2007). The adjustments added 3,789,001 EUR in thousands to each profit and loss figure, 1,454,001 EUR in thousands to each cash flow amount, and one unit to each share price change. To align inventory turns with DEA where higher inputs should yield higher outputs, they were inverted (lower inventory turns result in higher input numbers).

The paper also suggests avenues for future research. Investigating larger economies, especially focusing on major European exchange-listed companies or those in North America, would be beneficial because leading global retail companies operate in these markets. Additionally, exploring the increasingly Asia-based manufacturing sector could provide valuable insights. These future studies should further explore the role of inventory and assets to expand on findings from the current research. Another suggestion involves analyzing data from before the global financial crisis to understand the impact of higher interest rates during that period, which could highlight the significance of inventory and assets.
