Multiple approaches have been proposed for translating between hybrid automata and other formalisms. An informal methodology for converting a hybrid automaton into a hypa structure is detailed in one study. Another piece of research presents a formal method for translating a hybrid automaton and its parallel compositions into the ACPsrt framework, complete with verification of the transformation's accuracy. Furthermore, a paper has established that linear hybrid action systems are a more constrained subset of linear hybrid automata and provided a validated methodology for converting linear hybrid action systems into linear hybrid automata.

In addition, the concept of delay in processes can be specified using delay predicates or represented by the 'any delay' operator [p], which introduces nondeterministic delay in the behavior of a process term p. When this operator is in effect, the process p can experience an arbitrary delay without altering its action behavior. Whenever the process proceeds with an action, the 'any delay' operator ceases to influence the process.

Hierarchical system modeling is facilitated by the possibility of locally declaring variables, channels, and recursion definitions. This is achieved using the process instantiation term lp(xk, hm, en), which allows for the reuse of process definitions with varying parameters such as external variables xk, external channels hm, and expressions en. CHI language structures typically include such process instantiations to promote reusability.

The process of gathering components in an assembly process is represented via the parallel composition (a? x b? y c? z), ensuring each part is received at the earliest opportunity. The process terminates once all parts have been successfully received.

Notably, the core distinction between the semantics of timed transition systems and hybrid transition systems lies in the labeling of action and time transitions. In timed transition systems, action transition labels are the events of the hybrid automaton, while hybrid transition systems also incorporate variable valuations before and after the action. Labels for time transitions in timed transition systems show only the time duration, while hybrid transition systems include variable trajectories as labels. Timed transition systems can have multiple initial states, in contrast to hybrid transition systems with a singular initial state that embodies the collective behavior of all the initial states from the timed transition system.

An important detail is that HAU (Hybrid Automata with Urgency) automata do not contain urgent transitions, a condition stemming from the semantic definition in HAU, where transitions can be urgent, as opposed to linear hybrid I/O-automata, where this is not the case. The relationship between linear hybrid I/O-automata and HAU automata has been investigated and formalized in the literature.
