This paper discusses slender languages, which are linguistic systems that contain only a limited number of words of any given length. These languages are of particular interest in cryptography, where they can be used to decrease the complexity of key distribution and decryption. The paper proposes the following scenario: when a plaintext is encrypted using a key of a certain length (n), it produces a ciphertext of the same length. If the intended receiver knows the key, decrypting the original text is simple. However, transmitting all possible keys to the legitimate receiver is impractical. To mitigate this, keys should be chosen from a slender language to limit the number of keys the receiver needs to test for each ciphertext.

The paper defines slender languages formally using a function, denoted by #L(n), that counts the number of words of length n in language L. A language is k-poly-slender if this number is in O(n^k), and simply slender if it is 0-poly-slender.

The authors also investigate the homomorphism-related properties of k-Dyck loops and their role in k-poly-slender context-free languages. They suggest that families of these languages are closed under homomorphisms, exploring the implications of this property for categorizing k-poly-slender regular languages.

A central result of the paper is Theorem 3.5, which asserts that for every poly-slender context-free language over a given alphabet 'v', there exists a poly-slender regular language over a new alphabet 'u' such that the original language can be obtained by applying a homomorphism from 'u' to 'v'. This establishes a connection between poly-slender context-free languages and poly-slender regular languages via homomorphisms.

The paper also discusses representations of words by introducing a new alphabet 'v 0', which consists of modified versions of the symbols in 'v', and defines the representation 'w0' for a word composed of symbols from 'v'.

Overall, the paper contributes to the field of computational linguistics and cryptography by exploring slender languages and their properties, emphasizing their potential applications in secure communications. To deepen their understanding, readers are encouraged to refer to additional sources and combinatorial literature on words.
