An academic paper outlines the concept of an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that uses a module manager to manage changes in source code. A module refers to a unit of code, such as a file or package, that can have dependencies on other modules. Changes to a module can have varying effects depending on its dependencies and the programming language used.

The authors suggest a design for a language-specific module manager that can be adapted to a particular programming language's module behavior. They describe the architecture of their IDE implementation, focusing on managing and responding to changes in the modular structure of code for different languages, like Java and ASF+SDF.

A primary aim of the research is to generate IDEs for various programming languages and domain-specific languages, which is traditionally focused on syntactic and semantic analysis tools. The paper emphasizes the interactive behavior of IDEs rather than these tools alone.

Divided into sections, the paper explains various aspects of the module manager's design, including the underlying data model, the mapping of language concepts, module attributes, namespaces, events, module predicates, and the API of the manager. The paper also discusses the use of directed graphs to represent module dependencies, strategies for scheduling actions within the IDE, and listeners for event-driven actions.

In particular, the authors highlight the use of module predicates to program information propagation uniquely suited for a specific language within the IDE, drawing from principles of attribute grammar systems and modal logic.

The IDE must also include generic graph manipulation algorithms to facilitate IDE actions. The paper mentions a language for expressing conditions for triggering events within the IDE based on module properties and introduces an incremental evaluation algorithm for these conditions.

It concludes with case studies in which the module manager was used to construct IDEs for ASF+SDF and Java, demonstrating the module manager's efficiency in handling code changes and its flexibility for different programming languages. The paper suggests that the module manager's language-parametric design effectively propagates information through dependency graphs and efficiently updates module predicates upon changes in the code.
