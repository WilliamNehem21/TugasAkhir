We examine the problem of vertex-coloring specifically for planar graphs, focusing on classic and polyhedral wheels as fundamental structures. We study the colorability of wheel combinations and present a new algorithm with three key principles for solving vertex-coloring challenges: 1) Choosing frontier vertices, 2) Handling encompassed wheels, 3) Managing wheel centers.

In our research, we propose polyhedral wheels as the building blocks of planar graphs. These structures involve compositions that we analyze for their chromatic properties. We introduce a new approach to determine the colorability of classic and polyhedral wheels.

Considering a graph G=(V, E) that is undirected and simple, we expect readers to be familiar with graph theory, especially planar graphs. We define our specific notation for the discussion.

We expand the wheel category by allowing any polygon to serve as the central face, naming this a polyhedral wheel. Such wheels have vertices in their surrounding cycle that are not adjacent to the central vertex, which is connected to all faces of the wheel. On a graph's inner-face graph, GF, a polyhedral wheel appears as a cycle.

For acyclic graphs, which we liken to trees, we use the term 'node' instead of 'vertex'. Knowing acyclic graphs are 2-colorable, and given that each graph's vertex is not limited to the three colors available, these graphs can be colored with three colors.

If GF is a tree, then its related planar graph G is termed a polygonal tree, signifying that G's cycles can be arranged as a tree with polygon nodes. To 3-color a polygonal tree effectively, one can arrange a visitation order for all faces in the planar graph.

Acyclic graphs are 2-colorable, so to 3-color G, we traverse GF's nodes in pre-order, coloring the parent node's face before its children's. We consider two adjacent faces at each level, with shared boundary vertices.

Existing work has explored 3-colorable planar graphs by examining cycles' lengths. For instance, certain results prove 3-colorability for graphs without close triangles or 5-cycles. Our analysis differs, targeting topology recognition formed by polyhedral wheel unions to design our coloring algorithm.

Theorem 5.4 highlights that if graph GJ is a polygonal tree, it can be 3-colored, provided K4 and any traditional wheel are absent. If not, alternative algorithms could be suggested for the 3-coloring.

In algorithm step 2a, we process wheels that encompass others, identifying those to color first, like wheel RH dominating RI. We assign a color to the selected vertex and mark adjacent vertices accordingly.

For an input planar graph G=(V, E), the algorithm first selects and removes external vertices iteratively until none remain. In an outerplanar graph situation, any vertex could be selected, with a complexity of O(n).

During step 2a, the algorithm identifies and processes subsumed wheels using data structures to record wheel components. We construct wheel cycles through a breadth-first search with O(m) time complexity. These cycles are then compared across wheels, potentially up to n^2 comparisons in the worst case.
