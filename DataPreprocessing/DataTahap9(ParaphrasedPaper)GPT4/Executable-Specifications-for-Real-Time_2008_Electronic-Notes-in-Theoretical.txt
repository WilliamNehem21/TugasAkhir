This academic paper discusses architectural notations, particularly focusing on Architectural Interaction Diagrams (AID), an intuitive and expressive design language that uniquely supports different types of inter-process communications (IPC) as native features, facilitating clear and reusable system specifications.

The paper's structure is as follows: Section 2 introduces the foundational concepts of AID which is a non-timed architecture design language. The paper then extends these concepts to produce a timed version called Timed Architectural Interaction Diagrams (TAID), detailed in Section 3. Examples of timed IPC are provided to demonstrate the formalism. Section 5 reviews related literature, and Section 6 concludes the study.

Buses play an essential role in the AID framework, functioning as transducers that transform individual component actions into system-wide dynamics. They manage both the data exchange between components and the synchronization of their actions.

In this context, links are defined as connections between component ports and bus ports. The authors suggest that understanding the basic intuition behind links and gates is sufficient for the paper's objectives.

The modeling approach relies on two assumptions - maximal progress and time determinacy - to ensure that time-related uncertainties do not affect the system's state. An in-depth discussion on these topics is provided in Section 2.3.

For the extension into TAID, all the structural operational semantics (SOS) rules of AID are employed with an additional rule specifying the timing behavior of networks based on their constituent components and buses. This rule ensures clock synchronization and checks that no communication is ongoing when a clock transition occurs.

When examining bus behavior, the model assesses whether involved components have timed out (discontinued interest in the communication). If a timeout occurs, the bus enters an error state.

The FIFO (first-in, first-out) structure embeds logic to avoid data collision by checking for existing data with the same timestamp before writing new data. If a collision is detected, neither data piece is allowed in. This system also allows for negative timestamps, indicating data that has not yet been read. Among those, the model prioritizes the data with the smallest (most negative) timestamp for reading since it has been waiting the longest.

This summary highlights the main points of the paper, presenting a comprehensive overview of the extended AID model to include time considerations in system design and the sophisticated handling of data synchronization and communication within this framework.
