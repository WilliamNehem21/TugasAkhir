This research examines the effects of a reinforced self-compacting concrete (SCC) jacketing method on the restoration of shear-damaged reinforced concrete beams. Initially, three beams primarily subjected to shear stress were loaded until failure using a four-point bending test. Following damage, the beams were repaired with SCC jackets, which reinforced the lower part and sides of the beams with small steel bars and U-shaped stirrups.

The intention of the SCC jackets was both to enhance the shear strength of the beams and modify their failure mode from brittle to more ductile. The experimental data affirmed that the jacketing technique improved the performance and strength of the beams compared to their pre-damaged state.

The paper also offers analytical calculations for the flexural and shear capacities of the beams, with the observed data aligning well with predicted values, underscoring the promise of SCC jacketing in beam rehabilitation.

In the rehabilitation process, the damaged beams were encased in a 25 mm thick SCC layer, bolstered by mild steel bars and U-shaped stirrups. These reinforcements aimed to restore and exceed the original structural integrity of the affected areas.

Before applying the jackets, the damaged beams had experienced extensive shear damage, including spalling of the concrete covering and significant diagonal cracking. Loose concrete fragments were entirely removed, and the gaps were filled using the SCC. No surface roughening of the damage area was conducted before applying the jacket.

To support the longitudinal bars of the jacket, L-shaped mild steel dowels were placed along the vertical sides of the original beams, secured with epoxy resin in pre-drilled holes. The spacing of these supporting dowels was relatively sparse. All steel bars, stirrups, and dowels in the jacket were welded together for added stability and support.

Overall, the research suggests that SCC jacketing is a successful method for restoring the bearing capacity and general performance of shear-damaged reinforced concrete beams, with test findings correlating well with the analytical predictions.
