Term rewriting is a recognized framework for defining and quickly prototyping systems, which has shown to be beneficial in fields such as theorem proving, program transformation, and algebraic specification. Its application in computer security, particularly in verifying security protocols, has also been successful.

Access control, a critical aspect of computer security, traditionally uses the access control matrix to define permissions. However, this matrix struggles to represent dynamic access control policies that depend on various environmental attributes like time or location. For instance, while military security policies add confidentiality levels to the matrix to prevent certain read and write operations based on these levels, they lack the flexibility to account for more dynamic conditions.

The paper also emphasizes the challenges and considerations when combining policies using term rewriting systems. It warns about problems with terminationâ€”a situation where combining two terminating systems doesn't guarantee a terminating composite system. The discussion points out that maintaining consistency and other properties in policy composition can be addressed by applying existing knowledge about the modularity of confluence and termination conditions in term rewriting systems.

The authors advocate for term rewriting as an effective method for formalizing and implementing access control policies that can adapt to dynamic environmental factors. They argue that term rewriting allows a declarative approach to policy definition and facilitates the rapid prototyping of policies due to the availability of efficient term rewriting system implementations. The approach also supports reasoning about essential properties of access control policies by drawing parallels between these properties and the characteristics of term rewriting systems.
