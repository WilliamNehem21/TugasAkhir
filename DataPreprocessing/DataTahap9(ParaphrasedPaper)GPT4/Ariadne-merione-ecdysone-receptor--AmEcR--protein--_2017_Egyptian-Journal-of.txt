A shared characteristic between both gradual (hemimetabolous) and complete (holometabolous) insect development types is that both rely on periodic surges of the steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) to signal each stage of development. The central player in enacting these hormonal signals is the ecdysone receptor complex, which orchestrates the physiological and morphological changes that occur during insect molting and is activated by ecdysteroid hormones, such as 20E, upon binding. Though the molecular mechanisms of 20E are well-investigated in insects with complete metamorphosis, knowledge on its actions in gradual metamorphosis insects remains limited. The hormone 20E is lipophilic, synthesized and released into the insect circulatory system (hemolymph), and enters cells to drive metamorphosis. The ecdysone receptor is a type of nuclear receptor that contains two primary regions: the ligand-binding domain (LBD) for hormone binding and the DNA-binding domain (DBD) for gene regulation and is usually found in an inactive state within the cytoplasm. When 20E binds to the LBD, it activates the DBD. The ecdysone receptor protein (EcR) structure includes five components: A/B for transcriptional activation, C for DNA-binding, D as a hinge region, and E for ligand-binding.

The molting process is prompted by a variety of transcription factors within the nuclear receptor superfamily, which can move into the nucleus due to their heterodimeric nature. They bind to specific DNA sites to initiate replication, chromosome remodeling, and ultimately translation. Ecdysone signaling plays a crucial role in controlling the degradation and new formation of the insect cuticle, with chitin being a substantial part of the cuticle.

Targeting specific developmental proteins could offer a method for pest control by designing compounds that mimic 20E and disrupt receptor functions. Advanced bioinformatics tools can aid in creating molecules that dock precisely with ecdysone receptor proteins.

In this research, the Glide program was used to establish a receptor grid without special constraints, and simulation showed the conformational structures of different ecdysone receptor complexes by comparing their root mean square deviation (RMSD), which is a measure of the average atomic displacements across frames.

Traditionally, arthropod control relied heavily on chemical insecticides, which unfortunately harm the environment and non-target species, reduce the nutritional value of food, and result in pesticide residues that are linked to various diseases. According to the WHO, millions suffer from pesticide poisoning annually, with children in developing countries being especially at risk.

Nowadays, numerous databases offer a plethora of plant-based compounds that could prove effective against major agricultural pests and are environmentally friendly. These compounds might regulate proteins allosterically, altering protein conformation to prevent 20E from binding to its dedicated pocket. Limonoids, a type of tetranortriterpenoid, are known for their broad spectrum of biological activities including insecticidal, anti-feedant, and growth-regulating properties on insects. The effects of nimbolide, a limonoid, were examined on SF9 (insect) cell lines, with significant activity observed at specific concentrations.

Although the butterfly Ariadne merione, from the family Nymphalidae, isn't considered a major pest, in silico studies help gather data on target proteins and compounds to potentially design insect-specific biopesticides to manage pests from families like Noctuidae, Pyralidae, and Tortricidae that are significant threats to agriculture.
