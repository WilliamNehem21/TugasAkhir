Statecharts are a visual formalism for modeling systems that react to events, often used in embedded and real-time systems. This approach augments traditional finite-state machines by incorporating hierarchies, concurrency, and transition priorities. Statecharts have gained popularity due to their intuitive graphical representations and capability to model complex control software hierarchically, influencing several commercial design tools like ROOM, Statemate, Stateflow, and UML.

Significant works by Mikk, Lakhnech, and Siegel have explored the semantics of transitions that cross hierarchical boundaries, presenting an extended hierarchical automata (EHA) as an intermediate format compatible with the Statemate environment. While Argos, a similar language, does not handle boundary-crossing transitions, EHA includes them with prioritized transitions.

Other formalisms have integrated concepts comparable to entry and exit points that this paper proposes. ROOM has utilized the partitioning of transitions to centralize information, and Alur and Grosu proposed a statechart-style language with a modular and compositional semantics addressing boundary-crossing transitions through entry and exit points. However, this language lacks events, and its trace-based semantics encounter issues with modeling types of nondeterminism, paralleling challenges seen in Huizing, Gerth, and de Roever's work.

The paper focuses on hierarchical state machines (HSMs), a subset of statecharts that allow hierarchical structures and boundary-crossing transitions but exclude concurrency, and transition labels are limited to simple event specifications. This focused study on HSMs is to understand boundary-crossing transitions, eventually discussing potential integrations with other works for a compositional theory addressing statecharts' broader features.

The paper also touches on enriching hierarchical process algebra (HPA) to encompass statecharts' traits, including concurrency and preemption. SPL, a process algebra introduced earlier, offers a compositional semantics to statecharts lacking boundary transitions. It incorporates a transition-based semantics with a syntax adjusted by a set of event labels. The paper suggests integrating HPA into SPL, modifying SPL's operators to align with HPA's labels and introducing new capabilities, like entry and exit handling, to cater to HPA's features. Despite the relatively expansive syntax this would result in, the current work mainly focuses on developing HPA technically.

In summary, the paper delineates how various formalisms approach modeling complex state-based systems, particularly examining the semantics of boundary-crossing transitions. It proposes HSMs as a simplified model to study these transitions, with an eye towards eventually integrating these insights into a compositional theory for statecharts that includes concurrency and other advanced features.
