This paper introduces a novel decomposition approach for computing the Inverse Modified Discrete Cosine Transform (IMDCT). The presented method focuses on enhancing the computational efficiency of IMDCT by breaking down a single pair of long transforms into two pairs of shorter transforms, each being half the size of the original long transforms. This decomposition process can be executed recursively to achieve even smaller-sized transforms, leading to a reduction in the number of computational cycles required. Experimental data suggest that this new method can compute a 512-point IMDCT using only 9,641 cycles, a notable improvement over previous methods. The full derivation of this algorithm is provided in the second section of the paper, while conclusions are drawn in the third section. Additionally, it was noted that the estimated cycle count is lower than the 12,153 and 9,718 cycles reported in prior works. Further research is anticipated to rigorously assess the specific number of computational cycles in future experiments.
