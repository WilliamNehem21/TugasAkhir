In a previous work, we integrated the description logic ALC with coalition logic to enable modal operators to be applied to both formulas and concepts. However, this integration kept the layers for agents and concepts relatively independent. In particular, it didn't allow for specifying the interactions and influences between agents and groups using the first-order elements of description logic. In this paper, we address this limitation by enhancing the language for concepts to include individual names, which also encompass agents. This expansion allows for defining coalitions through more intricate terms and thereby expressing more complex properties, as demonstrated by examples in Section 2.4.

We also update the satisfiability procedure from our previous work to accommodate this enriched language, and we provide new complexity bounds for the revised satisfiability problem. Additionally, we define the concept of a run, which spans across all states, tying each individual to a type in every state, thus upholding the constant domain assumption. However, runs need to satisfy certain conditions in order to maintain satisfiability.

Building on Theorem 3.12, we develop an algorithm that constructs a finite representation of a compact Hintikka quasistructure for CL-ALCO formulas. This algorithm is then used as a decision procedure for checking formula satisfiability. We verify the algorithm's termination, soundness, and completeness.

We note a PSPACE lower bound for the satisfiability problem in coalition logic from Pauly's result, which uses a polynomial reduction from the satisfiability problem of KD logic. Given that the satisfiability problem of KDALC is NEXPTIME-hard, we hypothesize that the NEXPTIME-hardness of CLALC could be proven using a similar reduction technique.

Furthermore, this research prompts reflection on methodology. While our prior work suggested a general approach to merging strategic and descriptive aspects in multi-agent systems, it lacked compelling specifications despite sophisticated semantic machinery. In contrast, the modest extension proposed in this paper demonstrates significant impact by enabling more detailed and effective specifications. This underscores that relatively minor theoretical enhancements can considerably affect the practical utility of a language.
