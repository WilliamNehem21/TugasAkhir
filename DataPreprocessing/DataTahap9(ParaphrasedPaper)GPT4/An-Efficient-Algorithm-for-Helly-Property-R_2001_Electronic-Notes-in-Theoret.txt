Since its inception by C. Berge, the field involving the Helly property has grown significantly and has become one of the most crucial components in the realm of hypergraph theory. It has garnered considerable attention and research over the past years and presents a unifying characteristic across various categories of these set systems, including balanced, unimodular, normal, and arboreal hypergraphs, among others.

The significance of the Helly property has recently extended beyond traditional areas, notably into the realm of image analysis, where it has emerged as a key concept for examining the geometric aspects of digital images. Within the field of image processing, the Helly property provides a means of describing a type of local consistency in images. This paper aims to present novel findings related to this property, including a polynomial-time algorithm to determine the presence or absence of the Helly property in linear hypergraphs.

A famous theorem attributed to Edward Helly is one of the most well-known in this context. It's worth acknowledging that the Helly property can be considered a special instance of the theorems of the Helly type. This property is recurrent across several domains of mathematics. For example, in arithmetic, the Chinese Remainder Theorem can be interpreted as stating that arithmetic progressions possess the Helly property. Similarly, families of intervals within a lattice exemplify another Helly family. The relevance of this property has been particularly accentuated within discrete and computational geometry. Central to the theory of hypergraphs, the Helly property is shared by numerous classes of hypergraph.
