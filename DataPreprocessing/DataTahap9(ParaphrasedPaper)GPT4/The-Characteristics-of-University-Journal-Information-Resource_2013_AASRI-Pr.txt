The paper discusses the importance of employing knowledge creativity in managing university journal information resources. This management plays a key role in supporting research and teaching activities, as well as in the broader dissemination and expansion of knowledge within academic settings. University journals, rich in literature due to extensive research, teaching, and academic exchange, represent comprehensive and diverse disciplines and robust academic content, reflecting the state of university research and education. The paper emphasizes the need for professional information management, requiring a combination of information knowledge, broad professional understanding, information consciousness, and ethics.

Effective and professional management of journal information resources involves the acquisition, organization, and transmission of information, encouraging librarians to develop their informational capabilities. As new cross-disciplinary fields emerge and literature volumes grow, university librarians face the challenge of meeting diverse information needs. Flexibility in information service modes is crucial for satisfying the demands of researchers and students, as well as for facilitating the efficient use of journal literature.

The paper suggests that librarians should take a proactive approach by engaging in intelligence research and offering deep-level intelligence services to convert passive materials into active information resources. They should also prioritize maintaining up-to-date information and utilize digital platforms for effective dissemination and sharing. Openness and collaborative sharing of information resources within and beyond the university are highlighted as essential for mutual development.

Overall, the paper advocates for strategic management of journal information resources and the active engagement of librarians in the research and teaching processes, emphasizing the role of university journals as specialized information carriers. The ultimate goal is to support knowledge transfer, skill building, and the fostering of innovation, thereby contributing to both academic and broader societal economic development.
