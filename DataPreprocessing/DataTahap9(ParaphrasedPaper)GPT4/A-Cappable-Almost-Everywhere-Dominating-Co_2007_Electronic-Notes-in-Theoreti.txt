Our work demonstrates that an anti-enumeration (a.e.) dominating computably enumerable (c.e.) degree can be found beyond any given upper cone of promptly simple degrees. This is achieved by innovatively integrating a traditional approach from the promptly simple degree framework, particularly employing the recursion theorem to facilitate swift diagonalizations. Although the reliance on common features in constructing c.e. degrees, such as the cone avoidance technique, is often seen as indispensable, our novel combination of strategies counters this convention.

The structure of our construction utilizes a branching tree method, characterized by distinct roles for various tree levels. In this arrangement, the tree levels that correspond to the index 3e are designated for the 'backing strategy' denoted as 'me'. The levels indexed by 3n+1 are assigned alternately to 'domination' and 'minimal pair strategies', with the levels 3(2e)+1 specifically attributed to 'de', and the levels 3(2e+1)+1 to 'qe'. Lastly, the tree levels 3e+2 are allocated for the strategy 'pe'.
