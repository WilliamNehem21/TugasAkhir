Several studies have investigated its properties. The team led by Adesegun showed that the stem bark extract of the plant possesses significant antioxidant effects through their lab-based research. Screening for toxicity of various Nigerian plants traditionally used for cancer treatment revealed that the leaf extract of S. ellipticum displayed the most potent cytotoxicity on colorectal (HT29) and breast (MCF-7) cancer cell lines, as well as HeLa cervical cancer cells, with effects similar to the standard chemotherapy drug, cisplatin. Nana et al. have reported the phytochemical composition, antioxidant activity in a lab setting, and anti-malarial effects of the S. ellipticum stem bark extracts. The current study aims to explore the effects of the 2 mg S. ellipticum (SE) sample. This sample was blended with 100 mg of potassium bromide (KBr), which is of Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) grade, and compressed into a 3 mm translucent disc. The disc was immediately placed in the holder for analysis. The spectrum of the SE sample was recorded using an FT-IR spectrophotometer from Perkin Elmer, covering a wavelength range of 1000 to 3500 nm. This method helped to pinpoint characteristic spectral peaks, indicating the types of chemical bonds and potential functional groups in the SE sample. The peak values were documented, and the analysis was repeated to confirm the spectral data.
