This study explores the effects of green tea polyphenon-60 (PP-60) on metabolic risk factors, oxidative stress, inflammation, and heart cell death in rats with diabetes induced by streptozotocin (STZ). The male rats were treated with PP-60 after diabetes induction and displayed improved blood sugar control, insulin levels, and lipid profile, while inflammation and oxidative stress were reduced. PP-60 treatment reduced heart cell death, regulated cell protective and destructive proteins, and repaired DNA damage in the heart. Green tea catechins, especially epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), are suggested to be the active components contributing to these benefits. This points to the potential of PP-60 for improving heart health in diabetic conditions.
