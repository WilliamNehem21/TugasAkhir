This academic paper discusses the relevance of software watermarking as a method for protecting the intellectual property rights of software developers by embedding a unique signature into a program to establish ownership and deter piracy. The paper provides a classification of software watermarking techniques developed over the past twenty years into three main types based on the signature extraction process: static, dynamic, and abstract watermarking. Static watermarking is defined as a method where the embedded signature does not alter the properties of the program that an observer is interested in, thus maintaining its behavior unchanged from the observer's point of view.

The paper highlights the importance of watermark resilience against collusive attacks, which aim to erase the signature by analyzing and comparing various marked versions of the software. This is described as a phenomenon related to the concept of abstract non-interference among programs.

The authors continue with a more detailed validation of their watermarking model compared to previous, less thorough approaches. They take into account two known watermarking techniques and incorporate them into their conceptual framework to support their primary claimâ€”that static and dynamic watermarking are examples of the broader category of abstract watermarking.

The paper also delves into the idea of transparency, which relates to the difficulty of detecting whether a program includes a hidden watermark (termed a "stegoprogram"). A watermarking system is said to be invisible with respect to an observer if the observer cannot distinguish between the original program and any stegoprogram derived from it.

To evaluate their model, the authors formalize both a dynamic and a static watermarking technique within their framework, stating that the case for abstract watermarking is straightforward. They argue that the effectiveness of detecting and altering the signature depends on whether the attack comprehensively deals with the semantics used to encode the signature, which is likened to possessing a secret key that reveals the watermark to those familiar with the encoding method.

In conclusion, the paper positions their framework as a means to rigorously assess the quality of a watermarking scheme in terms of resilience, secrecy, transparency, and accuracy. They validate the effectiveness of two known watermarking systems within this framework, aiming to pave the way for a formal theory of software watermarking that can authenticate both new and existing techniques in terms of their efficiency. This contribution is seen as a significant step toward establishing a formalized method for evaluating and certifying software watermarking approaches.
