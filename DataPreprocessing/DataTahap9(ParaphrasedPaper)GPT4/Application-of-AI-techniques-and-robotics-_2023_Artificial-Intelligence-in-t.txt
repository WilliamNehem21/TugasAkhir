The review study conducted has involved an extensive survey of over 700 academic papers, with more than 150 of those papers being cited within the review. This comprehensive review examines the application of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques across various stages of agriculture, including the management of agricultural robot path planning. The paper identifies key areas where AI is most often implemented in agriculture, as well as noting sectors where the use of AI could be expanded. It spotlights the potential for AI to enhance existing agricultural processes and outlines the various AI techniques and algorithms that have been popularly employed, particularly in the form of hybrid models.

Through the work, AI's impact is evaluated based on simulation, experimental implementation, hybrid approaches, and problem-solving applications in agriculture. The paper provides both tabular and graphical analyses on a year-by-year basis for clarity and enhanced comprehension. The review aims to distinguish between agricultural phases such as cultivation and harvesting, which are often still performed using traditional methods, and monitoring tasks where AI integration is more prevalent.

The techniques discussed include fuzzy logic (FL), artificial neural networks (ANN), genetic algorithms (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), artificial potential fields (APF), and other algorithms for intensive investigation.

Fuzzy logic (FL), first proposed by L. Zadeh in 1965, has advantages over conventional decision processes by dealing effectively with nonlinear, complex, and uncertain problems through a logic system that operates on degrees of truth rather than binary true/false outcomes. Its adoption has advanced decision-making in agricultural tools for various functions from UAV navigation to crop management.

ANNs simulate the human brain's decision-making by processing information through layers of nodes (input, hidden, and output) to deliver solutions to complex, dynamic problems. ANN-based vision systems have been applied in precision agriculture, including weed monitoring and plant disease diagnosis with impressive classification rates.

Genetic algorithms (GA), conceptualized by John Holland in the 1960s, leverage evolutionary principles for problem optimization. The iterative process of selection, crossover, and mutation leads to robust solutions in areas such as crop planning and pest control.

Other techniques like PSO optimize decision-making with applications from crop recommendations to disease identification, while APF has been useful for real-time applications such as autonomous navigation of agricultural robots.

The review also references methods like cell decomposition (CD) for path planning and the harmony search algorithm (HS), which is inspired by musical notes for optimizing decision-making. These and other algorithms have shown promised in optimizing agricultural tasks, thereby underscoring the potential for AI to significantly improve efficiency and effectiveness within the sector.
