This academic paper discusses enhancing the reliability of mathematical proofs through the use of proof assistants. In the second phase of ensuring reliability, it highlights the necessity of a small, manually-verifiable proof-checker that operates independently from the complex systems generating the proofs. Adhering to the de Bruijn criterion with a proof assistant can significantly heighten the trustworthiness of the proofs.

The paper describes a syntax-driven derivation system that streamlines the proof construction process by applying singular, appropriate rules to each sub-goal, leading to clear and unambiguous representations. This structure demands explicit details such as parameters for constants and ensures the absence of free variables.

Weak Type Theory (WTT) is suggested as a foundation for converting mathematical texts into type theory, with WTT extended by logic (WTTL) to maintain structure when translating conventional mathematic literature (CML) texts into type theory. This entails adding logic definitions and rules into the type theory judgement context.

One approach the paper mentions is using a proof assistant's language and tools to generate a different proof, recognizing that the resulting proof may structurally differ from the original. Subsequently, the generated proof term and script might not reflect the original proof's intent clearly.

The paper references prior work by Severi, Poll, Bloo, Kamareddine, and others on introducing definitions in pure type systems, which is a common feature in most current theorem proving systems. These are often utilized to simulate forward reasoning. In their case study, global definitions were introduced to accurately convey the declarative elements of proof representation.

The study found that by selecting an alternate proof representation within the available systems, it is feasible to accurately emulate the structure of informal arguments from formal proofs, increasing confidence that the formal proof aligns with the author's intentions. This facilitates easier traceability and maintenance of proofs.

The paper acknowledges the development of various proof checking systems like Coq, Mizar, PVS, LEGO, Nuprl, Agda, HOL, Isabelle, and their evolution into sophisticated platforms. Despite this advancement, there is a noted delay in widespread acceptance among the broader mathematical community.

To foster acceptance of proof assistants by mathematicians, the authors call for a reduction in the barriers to using these tools, emphasizing the need for simpler formalization processes that do not require deep expertise in type theory. The paper concludes by expressing hope that its contributions may help achieve broader adoption goals within existing systems.
