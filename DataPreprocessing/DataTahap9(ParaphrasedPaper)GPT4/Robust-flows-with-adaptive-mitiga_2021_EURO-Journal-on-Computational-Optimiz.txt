In this paper, the authors address the problem of optimizing network flow robustness in the face of potential supply failures. They introduce a robustness measure that evaluates a network flow based on the maximum possible shortage at demand nodes after the best possible mitigation action has been taken. .

The authors describe a mathematical formulation of the problem, using linear programming (LP) to model a mitigation problem that can be adapted based on different scenarios. Scenarios represent potential supply failures and can be represented within a certain polyhedron, allowing for a wide range of risk assessments.

To solve the problem, the authors present a tri-level robust optimization method, which includes an outer linearization algorithm that iteratively adds cuts to the LP based on worst-case scenarios until convergence is reached.

A comparison is made to similar research by Bertsimas et al. (2013b), who looked at maximizing flow in networks after arc failures, whereas the current paper focuses on mitigating the impact of supply failures on shortage at demand nodes, aiming for exact solutions rather than approximate ones.

The paper is structured into six sections, covering the model definition, complexity, algorithms, experimental results, and a conclusion with possible extensions to the base model.

Additionally, the authors note that, in practical applications, shipment agreements and contracts often limit the ability to adjust nominal flows, which necessitates considering only additional flows within residual network capacities for mitigation purposes.

The computational experiments were conducted using Python and Gurobi, demonstrating the efficiency of the iterative cut generation algorithm, particularly for large scenario sets, and how it outperforms other algorithms for smaller scenario sets.

Finally, the authors suggest ways to extend their model, such as including the strategic placement of depots with additional capacities to help with mitigation, within a given budget.

Overall, this paper contributes to the field of robust network flow optimization by presenting algorithms that provide optimal solutions for mitigating shortages in the event of supply failures, and by allowing practitioners to incorporate a broad range of scenarios and risks into their planning processes.
