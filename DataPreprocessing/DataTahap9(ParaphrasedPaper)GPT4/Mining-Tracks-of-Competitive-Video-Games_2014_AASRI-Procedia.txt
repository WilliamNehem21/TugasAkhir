Despite advances in artificial intelligence, playing against a machine lacks the creativity and responsiveness of playing against a human gamer. Online gaming platforms provide the opportunity for players to challenge each other from across the globe, fostering a sense of teamwork even among strangers. The growth of online networks is erasing the limitations of distance, creating communities around games where players can interact, share guides, or participate in forums and events.

The paper focuses on video games that emulate team sports, where two teams compete within a regulated environment. It specifically examines a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) game, where the goal is to defeat the opposition by taking control of their territory, akin to rugby or American football. MOBA games feature a consistent playing field across matches, allowing for comparable situations between games that can provide insights into real-world sports play.

One such MOBA, Defense of the Ancients (DotA), involves two teams of five players on a virtual battlefield. Each player controls a unique hero, and the objective is to assist allied units in destroying enemy towers and structures. When players take excessive damage, their heroes temporarily die. Like rugby, the MOBA gameplay emphasizes team cooperation, with each choice of hero contributing to the team's strengths and weaknesses.

Coordination and timely responses to the opposition’s moves are crucial for success. While one-on-one confrontations occur, these instances rarely determine the game's outcome, as teamwork is essential. The competitive balance in MOBA allows for comebacks and often leads to critical turning points in the game.

The paper analyzes 1,120 DotA matches to determine if player positioning—topological clues—can predict match outcomes. Topological clues are normalized to a distance-related metric that reflects the spatial gap between the two teams' bases.

Experiments with supervised classification were then conducted to validate these spatial clues' relevance in predicting match outcomes. The study found that if a reliable predictive model can be developed using these clues, it implies their significance.

The findings offer a novel approach that complements professional analysis, where player behavior within the game (tracks) is studied to form strategic recommendations. This method utilizes the knowledge extracted from the gameplay data to enhance the understanding of optimal strategies.
