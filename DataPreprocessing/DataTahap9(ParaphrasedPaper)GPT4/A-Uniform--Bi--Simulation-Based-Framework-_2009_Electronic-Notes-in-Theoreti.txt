This academic paper discusses techniques for optimizing tree automata, which are structures used to represent infinite-state systems in various computational tasks. The paper introduces the concept of downward (bi-)simulations as a generalization of backward (bi-)simulations applied to word automata. These simulations can be used to determine if the language accepted by one state of the automaton is a subset of that accepted by another state. The paper suggests that employing these downward simulations is a natural and effective strategy for reducing the size of tree automata.

The authors reference previous work in which relations were chosen at random for automata reduction, and propose a more structured approach. They present a proof for the existence of a unique maximal combined preorder—a most comprehensive set of language-preserving relations—given an upward simulation and its corresponding downward simulation. They also provide an algorithm for computing this maximal preorder. The authors note that using this maximal preorder rather than a random selection can significantly affect the size of the resulting reduced automaton, as supported by their experimental results.

The paper touches on past research involving methods for computing (bi-)simulations over tree automata. These methods involve converting the problem into instances of computing (bi-)simulations over labeled transition systems and applying classical algorithms to the translated systems.

RTMC (Real-Time Model Checking) and ARTMC (Abstract-Refinement Tree Model Checking) are named as frameworks that utilize tree automata for analyzing infinite-state systems. These frameworks rely on efficient automata reduction techniques due to the potential size explosion of generated automata.

The authors conducted experiments with tree automata generated within RTMC and ARTMC frameworks. They compared the effectiveness of various reduction techniques on an AMD Athlon 64 X2 2.19GHz PC with 2.0 GB RAM.

The paper suggests that these principles can be expanded to other, more advanced types of automata, such as guided tree automata, nested word automata, or hedge automata. These are used across a range of applications, including formal verification, logic decision procedures, and natural language processing. It notes existing literature that has already explored automata reduction using bisimulation techniques.

Finally, the paper cites potential future research avenues. These include exploring more efficient computational methods for (bi-)simulation relations, such as symbolic computation for symbolically encoded automata, and deeper analysis into the combination of downward and upward simulation relations. It also suggests investigating weaker types of relations that can preserve the language accepted by a tree automata while further reducing its size.
