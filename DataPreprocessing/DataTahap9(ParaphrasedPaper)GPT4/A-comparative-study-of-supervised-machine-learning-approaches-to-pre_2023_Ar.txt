Methods: This paper presents a study comparing various supervised machine learning (ML) models to assess which is best suited for patient triage outcomes in emergency department (ED) settings. Researchers collected a retrospective dataset comprising 2688 patient visits to an ED from April 1, 2020, to June 9, 2020. Data included patient demographics (age, gender), vital signs (temperature, respiratory rate, heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation), chief complaints, and chronic illness history. Nine supervised ML models were evaluated based on their ability to predict patient outcomes. The models underwent training using the patient data and were then validated to assess their performance.

The study addresses the increasing challenges of triage in EDs caused by patient influx and the limitations of traditional triage systems, which are prone to human judgement errors. Nine ML algorithms were pre-selected, trained, and hyperparameters were tuned to identify the best-performing models. The final dataset consisted of 4540 patients and considered factors such as patient demographics, vital signs, chief complaints—largely influenced by COVID-19 symptoms due to the period's lockdown—and chronic illness presence.

An exploratory data analysis (EDA) was completed to determine the relationship between variables and their impact on model training outcomes. The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to identify significant feature correlations. Pre-processing included addressing data skewness with Box-Cox transformations, eliminating outliers using the interquartile range (IQR) method, and feature scaling through standardization.

The study acknowledges that no single evaluation metric, like accuracy or precision, suffices for imbalanced class problems like triage and utilizes multiple metrics for model assessment. Each model's performance was first examined using a confusion matrix, then further evaluated using accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score metrics. Despite these methods, the complexities of multi-class problems persist, and limitations, such as the small dataset and retrospective nature of the data, are noted.

Conclusion: The study offers a comparative analysis of supervised ML models for predicting triage outcomes in hospital EDs and provides methodological insights. Machine learning has shown potential in improving predictive triage evaluations by automating hyperparameter optimization and addressing biases. The models displayed high predictive capabilities for various patient outcomes, suggesting that ML can enhance triage efficiency in ED settings. Future research is called for using larger, prospective datasets to further validate and improve these models' generalizability and performance across diverse patient populations.
