The academic paper discusses how deductive databases emerged from the fusion of relational databases, logic, and artificial intelligence, forming a system capable of deriving new information from both base facts and a set of rules. Deductive database systems such as Datalog, which is based on logic programming principles and has no function symbols, facilitate this process. Datalog, often associated with the Prolog language, is particularly useful for applications in semantic web, ontologies, and optimization tasks, and its implementation is observed in several companies like LogicBlox and Semmle.

In comparison to SQL, Datalog offers clear semantics and greater expressiveness, particularly with recursive operations that SQL cannot easily handle. Despite numerous academic developments in this field, few systems encompass desired qualities like being multi-platform and open-source. This paper describes the features of the DES system, contrasting Datalog and SQL usage within it, and introduces methods for managing null values and implementing outer join operations and aggregate functions in Datalog.

DES ensures that queries with stratified negation, where negation doesn't interfere with recursion, behave correctly. Features include automatic temporary views, debugging tools, batch processing capabilities, and outputs that can be logged for integration with other applications. While DES takes advantage of efficient Prolog engines and memoization for performance, it does not focus on high performance for large data sets, lacks indexing, and does not support concurrency.

DES demonstrates how null values, which are common in real-world databases, can be handled in a Datalog context, including support for outer join operations. The paper explains how DES manages groups and aggregates, providing examples of queries that count employees in various scenarios and considering unknown values. DES also supports group by operations and condition-based aggregates.

In conclusion, the paper presents DES as an educational tool beneficial for students, teachers, and researchers to learn, teach, and experiment with SQL and Datalog in an integrated environment. Its open-source nature and full implementation in Prolog allow users to customize and extend its features.
