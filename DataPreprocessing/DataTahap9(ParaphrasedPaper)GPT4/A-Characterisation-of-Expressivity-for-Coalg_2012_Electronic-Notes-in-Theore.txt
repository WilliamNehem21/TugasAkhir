Abstract:

This paper builds on a previous work that presented a category theoretic characterization of expressivity for coalgebraic bisimulation via internal models for a modal logic. The current work extends this framework to encompass both bisimulation and simulation. An enriched category theoretic setting is employed, based on a symmetric monoidal closed category, which underpins the representation of state spaces (category X) and base logics (category A) with additional modal operators. Generalized transition systems are modeled as coalgebras for an endofunctor T on state spaces, while modal logics are treated as L-algebras arising from an endofunctor L on base logics. The paper delves into preordered sets, modal expressivity, and achieves a main characterization result that articulates a comprehensive understanding of the expressivity for simulation over finite branching labeled transition systems. By considering enriched categories and relying on the interplay between coalgebras, algebras, and specified functors, the paper offers a theoretical foundation for understanding how different types of behavioral relations, such as simulation and bisimulation, can be represented and analyzed in this abstract framework. Example 5.3 illustrates how a logical connection can establish the notion of simulation for a specific type, by generalizing the finite powerset functor. The results confirm that modal logic L sufficiently expresses simulation for finite branching labeled transition systems.
