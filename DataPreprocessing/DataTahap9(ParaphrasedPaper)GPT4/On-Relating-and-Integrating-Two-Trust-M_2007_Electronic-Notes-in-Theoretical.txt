This paper advances previous research towards establishing a unified framework for the specification and analysis of security and trust, focusing on dynamic coalitions such as mobile ad hoc networks and web services. The study delves into two established languages: the role-based trust-management framework (RT), particularly the foundational language RT0, and the transitive trust model, which outlines trust and recommendation relationships.

The authors demonstrate how the transitive trust model can be encoded into a subset of RT0, and then map this subset into the inference construct of a process algebra known as Crypto-CCS. Additionally, the paper introduces operators to deal with various levels of trust within these languages.

By examining the relationship between these languages, the researchers suggest that it is possible to model and analyze trust and recommendation issues in distributed systems using standard formal techniques based on inference systems. The paper acknowledges the initial research focused on developing a uniform framework for automated security and trust analysis but failed to fully integrate multiple theories simultaneously. This research bridges that gap by proposing an integrated inference system that captures both the RT approach and the transitive trust model.

The concept of roles is central to RT, where a role comprises a principal (e.g., 'A') and a role term (e.g., 'r'), forming an association like 'A.r' that defines a set of principals belonging to that role. The paper aims to formalize the trust model using inference rules, allowing for the management of trust relationships with the same mechanisms used in process algebras.

While RT does not explicitly handle relationships involving more than two principals, the transitive trust model can express recommendation and direct trust, maintaining a trace of the recommender's role. The authors describe explicit rules for merging trust measures, addressing transitivity, multiple trust paths, and chains of recommendations followed by functional trust.

The paper presents a simplified trust model augmented with trust measures and corresponding rules for their combination. While this simplified model aligns better with RT, some information, like recommender details, might be lost, pointing to potential refinements by extending RT to incorporate recommender information. The authors conclude by suggesting that future work might also explore the reverse encoding from RT to the simplified trust model, considering how to handle complex aspects like role intersections.
