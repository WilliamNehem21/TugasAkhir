A collection of new azosalicylic acid derivatives was created through the chemical pairing of salicylic acid with various aryl and heteroarylamine groups. The structure of these compounds was thoroughly verified using advanced analytical techniques. These derivatives were then assessed for their antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory (analgesic), and antioxidant properties. Out of the series, compounds 4e and 4h demonstrated the most notable antibacterial effectiveness against a variety of bacterial species, although no derivatives showed significant activity against the fungus Cryptococcus neoformans. Specifically, compound 4e, containing a bromine atom and a 3-methylphenyl azosalicylic acid analog structure, was found to have the highest analgesic effectiveness, inhibiting pain by 46.10%. These findings correlated well with theoretical predictions made using computer-simulated (in silico) models.

Additionally, the paper points out that salicylic acid derivatives possess antioxidant, antiproliferative, and cytotoxic activities, features that are also characteristic of the drug sulfasalazine. Sulfasalazine, an azosalicylic acid derivative, has been used effectively for 40 years to treat ulcerative colitis, a type of inflammatory bowel disease. The medication faces limitations due to side effects associated with the sulfapyridine part, which serves as a carrier molecule. When the compound reaches the colon, bacterial enzymes break the azo bond, releasing 5-aminosalicylic acid. Olsalazine, another derivative, is suggested as a potential replacement for sulfasalazine due to a more favorable side effect profile.

The literature review within the paper indicates that azosalicylic acids have been known for their biological activity and serve as precursors for drugs with anticarcinogenic, antiviral, antimicrobial, and antimalarial properties. Salicylates and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) work by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme, which reduces prostaglandin and thromboxane synthesis. The review also notes that pyrazolone and N-phenyl anthranil moieties are associated with analgesic and antimicrobial activities. The information collected spurred the researchers to synthesize these new azosalicylic acid derivatives for further biological evaluation.

The synthesized compounds were subjected to bioactivity tests against various bacterial strains obtained from the Institute of Microbial Technology, Chandigarh, India, as well as strains from the Pharmaceutical Biotechnology Division at Utkal University. Reference antibiotics such as ampicillin and fluconazole were used for comparison. Moreover, an acute oral toxicity study following OECD guidelines was conducted on female Wistar rats to determine the safety dosage for these compounds, observing acute toxic symptoms and behavioral changes over a 14-day period.

The antioxidant potential of the newly synthesized derivatives was assessed using a DPPH scavenging activity test compared to the standard antioxidant butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). Results were recorded by measuring the optical density at a specific wavelength.

In conclusion, the analogs with bromine and isoxazole substitutions exhibited strong antibacterial activity, with the bromine-substituted compound also showing significant analgesic effects. The antipyrinylazo and carboxyphenylazo substitutions conferred promising antioxidant activity to the derivatives. These experimental outcomes were supported by in silico predictions, adding credence to the potential medical application of these novel compounds.
