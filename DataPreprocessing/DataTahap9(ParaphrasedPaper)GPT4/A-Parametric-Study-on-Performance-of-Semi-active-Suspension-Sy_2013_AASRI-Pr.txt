The paper focuses on the development of semi-active suspension models that adjust damping based on varying levels. Simulink is the platform used for design, and the fuzzy logic controller is integrated via the fuzzy toolbox. The second section outlines the system modeling and the characterization of road disturbances. The third section details the fuzzy logic controller's design approach. Simulation outcomes and analytical findings are presented in the fourth section, along with a statistical parametric analysis. The final section, number five, provides a comprehensive conclusion of the study.
