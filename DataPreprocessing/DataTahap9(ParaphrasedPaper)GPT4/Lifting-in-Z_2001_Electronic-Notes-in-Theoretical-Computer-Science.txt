In this article, we discuss the benefits of using formal notations such as Z for creating precise and comprehensible specifications, particularly within fields like control theory and real-time systems. We introduce a style of specification in Z notation that captures the essential concepts in these domains efficiently and without unnecessary complexity. This notation is proven to be compatible with the draft standard Z and shown to facilitate the proof of specification properties.

The power of Z notation stems from its library of pre-established concepts and types, enabling both succinctness and precision, making specifications more manageable compared to traditional first-order predicate logic.

Prior research by Duddy et al. has looked into specifying timing characteristics in Z, highlighting the need for a set of function operators for continuous timed histories to be effectively described. They propose generalized arithmetic for real-valued functions which we have exemplified in this paper.

We've also observed the use of the same variable in multiple contexts within an expression, emphasizing the necessity for considering types during the lifting process in specifications.

Brien et al. offer an alternative, less algorithmic method, focusing on a suite of 'lifted' functions, operators, and relations without explicitly referencing points, which may simplify the proof process.

By blending attributes from the aforementioned approaches, we've developed a general lifting framework in Z. We lean towards an overloading strategy akin to functional programming concepts like those in Backus' work or modern monads.

This new method aligns with the Boolean-valued function approaches of Duddy et al. and Brien et al., but circumvents lifting partiality into predicates, maintaining adherence to classic Z.

We then illustrate two applications of lifting: enhancing the conciseness of abstract real-time specifications and formalizing the algebraic reasoning prevalent among process control engineers.

By utilizing lifted operators in Z, we facilitate the integration of established process control theory into our framework. This alignment with existing Z tools permits analysis and verification, contrasting with the ground-up modeling often seen in traditional computing formalisms such as Petri nets and state-transition automata.

We showcase a significantly simplified algebraic proof using lifted operators compared to previous efforts without such tools. A past attempt at machine-assisted proofing in Z without lifting, even in a simpler context, proved to be more complex.

The paper summarizes previous discussions on lifting in Z, lifting results from conventional algebras like the real field into function spaces. Our goal is to disseminate insights typically confined to unpublished materials to a broader audience.
