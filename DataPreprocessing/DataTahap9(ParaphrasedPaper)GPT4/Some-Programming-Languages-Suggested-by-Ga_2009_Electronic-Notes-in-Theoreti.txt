In academic research related to programming languages and mathematical models, there are two main approaches. One can either start with an existing language and try to construct a mathematical model that describes it, or begin with a mathematical model and then develop a programming language that embodies it. Opting for the latter can be motivated by the desire to harness concepts like intuitionistic linear logic. From this logic, one can derive cartesian closed categories as well as other relevant mathematical models, totaling seven models of interest outlined in Section 2 of the paper.

The presence of these structures within the model under discussion is testament to its mathematical richness. Initially, the definitions and the computational capabilities of the exponentials might seem obscure, but the forthcoming explanation of the associated programming languages will provide more clarity.

An additional component is required to complete the picture. Current mechanisms allow for building complex strategies for types within the models, but not for creating strategies for the simplest type, !1g. An operator introduced in the paper rectifies this issue.

Regarding the programming aspect, the term grammar is identical to that of FPC (a lambda calculus variant), but the typing rules differ in three significant ways, such as replacing certain type constructors and modifying the handling of contexts.

Further extensions to these languages ensure that they are complete for each of the seven models; thus, the models are fully abstract for these languages as well. The proof is outlined at a high level, with a more detailed implementation available online.

The use of universal types to derive definability results has led to a selection of primitive operators, which elucidate the computational capabilities of various mathematical models. This doesn't replicate the primitives found in current programming languages; instead, it suggests a preference for mechanisms like data encapsulation and coroutines instead of more traditional constructs like store cells and first-class continuations. These operators take full advantage of a linear type system, allowing for runtime security guarantees and the safe coexistence of powerful control operators with higher-order store constructs. The primitives discussed in the paper may serve as a foundation for designing new, practice-oriented language constructs, something the researchers are exploring in their ongoing work on a new language called Eriskay.
