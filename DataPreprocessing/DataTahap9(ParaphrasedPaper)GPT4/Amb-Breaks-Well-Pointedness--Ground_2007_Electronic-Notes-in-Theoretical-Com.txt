The initial challenge emerges from the concept of applicative bisimulation, which was originally brought up in the context of untyped systems and subsequently examined within typed frameworks. Applicative bisimilarity was proven to be a congruence using a clever technique. This technique has been effective in scenarios that are either deterministic or have a high degree of nondeterminism. However, as discussed in the literature, this technique fails when the 'amb' operator is involved. Consequently, it is still an unresolved question whether applicative bisimilarity can be considered a congruence when the 'amb' operator is present.
