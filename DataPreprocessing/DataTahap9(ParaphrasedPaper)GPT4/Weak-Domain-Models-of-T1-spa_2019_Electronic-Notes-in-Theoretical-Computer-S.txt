The paper discusses a poset (partially ordered set) model of a topological space X. A poset P that can be aligned with X such that the maximal elements of P, endowed with the Scott topology, are homeomorphic to X suggests that P models the space. However, for a space to have a poset model, it must meet the T1 separation axiom. It was previously established that a space homeomorphic to the maximal elements of a sequentially continuous directed-complete partial order (dcpo) is necessarily Choquet complete, which is not a characteristic of all T1 spaces.

This study further demonstrated that every T1 space X can be modeled by a local quasicontinuous domain, represented as ZH(X). A notable conclusion is that the space X is sober if and only if the corresponding model ZH(X) is sober. Consequently, if X is not sober, ZH(X) lacks quasicontinuity, indicating the existence of local quasicontinuous domains that are not inherently quasicontinuous.
