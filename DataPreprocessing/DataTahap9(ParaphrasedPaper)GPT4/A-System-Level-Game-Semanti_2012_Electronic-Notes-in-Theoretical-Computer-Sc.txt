In our research, we analyze a simplified game-theoretic model employing an abstract programming language reminiscent of C, free of type constraints. Our model encapsulates the concept of "available moves" within the framework of secrets comparable to those found in security protocol models, using a formal system of names to represent these secrets. This results in defining an adversary that possesses limitless power yet limited knowledge, capable of executing any move at will but may be unaware of certain actions—a concept similar to the Dolev-Yao attacker model in cybersecurity.

When the system takes over control due to an external function invocation, this constitutes a "proponent question" in the realm of game semantics, translating to a visible action within the model. Subsequently, any names that can be reached from the public ones in the memory storage become exposed, surrendering both control and information to the system. The transition indicating this action is labeled to reflect its visibility, with the label carrying specific identifying information.

However, the parts of the storage that remain private, denoted as "n\p," are inaccessible to system modifications. Consequently, the system can exercise free rein over familiar names but remains inept at manipulating or even predicting private names. The constraints placed upon continuation are merely to ensure cleanliness or hygiene, as previously discussed.

We explore two distinct programs, or more precisely, libraries, which instantiate a modulo-3 counter as an abstract data structure leveraging a concealed state variable 'x'. The environment interacting with this abstraction can only increase the counter's value or retrieve it, and is barred from performing any other actions. The first library's implementation increases the counter value, while the second decreases it.

Our key objective is to establish a meaningful and applicable notion of execution context for terms outside the language's syntax, offering numerous benefits. Modularity is one such advantage, allowing for the independent definition of the language and its operating environment; they must then align functionally to work in concert. We also strive for realism by mirroring real-world languages that support mechanisms such as separate compilation and foreign-function interfaces, accommodating programs with differing syntax that cannot be defined by traditional context notions. Lastly, simplicity emerges as we illustrate defining environmental restrictions in a non-computational, epistemic manner, resonating with the established Dolev-Yao model of context in security. This approach has the potential to provide a foundational semantic perspective for evaluating security properties of software, like information flow or resilient compilation, minimizing reliance on syntax and enhancing modularity.

Our perspective contrasts with goals of compositional compiler correctness, which focuses more on creating and enforcing machine code constraints to ensure safe interfacing between compiler-generated code and arbitrarily produced code. Though our approach is analytical, seeking to characterize arbitrary environments and assess the behavior of open terms within them, we acknowledge the synthetic nature of compositional compiler correctness and advocate for a better understanding of their interrelation.

In semantic composition, we introduce private names—internal markers crucial for synchronizing interactions between modules. These private identifiers, as shown by our findings, maintain their secrecy throughout the computational process. Therefore, when assessing bisimilarity in such models, it is imperative to prevent these private names from being intercepted by external transitions. This is accomplished by judiciously choosing these names exclusively from an auxiliary set, 'naux'.
