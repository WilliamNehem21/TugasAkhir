The article discusses integrating granular computing concepts into statistical analysis of qualitative data, going beyond existing analytical methods. It presents a mathematical model for clustering qualitative data, deriving its structure from granular computing theory. By describing data in terms of granules and their interdependencies, the paper proposes a way to measure and compare the significance of data clusters, aiming to identify the most relevant subsets for analysis. Using information theory, it suggests that the information content of granules can indicate the optimal clustering. The approach has been tested on large datasets, demonstrating both its practicality and enhanced performance, suggesting it could offer fresh insights into handling sizable and intricate qualitative datasets.
