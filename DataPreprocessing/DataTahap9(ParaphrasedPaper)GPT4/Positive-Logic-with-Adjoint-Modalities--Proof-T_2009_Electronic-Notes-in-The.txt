In the study of logics, not only relational or Kripke models are considered, but also various structured ordered systems, such as lattices with added operations. A pertinent question is how to most effectively derive a pair of such operations. In a Boolean algebra, which includes negation, any operator that preserves joins (unions) can be paired with an operator that preserves meets (intersections) through the use of de Morgan's laws. However, in a Heyting algebra, due to the absence of de Morgan's laws, such operators will not necessarily preserve meets symmetrically. In situations without negation, like in a distributive lattice, the concept of adjunction or Galois connection becomes relevant. Here, any join-preserving endofunction on a lattice will inherently have a corresponding right adjoint function that conserves meets.

These adjoint operations can be conceptualized in terms of information and uncertainty, and they can be utilized to encode and demonstrate certain knowledge-related characteristics within puzzles, such as the Muddy Children puzzle. The lack of negation in this setup limits expression to only positive knowledge traits. However, these proofs are simpler than those found in traditional modal logics. The process involves one step where the adjunction is unraveled and the modality of information is transformed into the modality of uncertainty, and subsequently, the specific assumptions of the scenario are integrated into the logic through an assumption rule. After this, the modalities are eliminated, and the proof is carried forward in a propositional context. Because the modality representing information does not have to be accurate, such logic can address more complex epistemic scenarios, including those where agents mislead others, thus leading to misinformation. These more complex scenarios have not been fully explored using traditional modal logic approaches within the realm of computer science.
