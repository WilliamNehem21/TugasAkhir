The proposed study highlights advancements in integrating single-omics data using a residual fully-connected neural network (RFCN) through Autogenome. Aiming to push the boundaries into multi-omics research, the framework considers the strengths of RFCN architectures and AutoML features from Autogenome, coupled with novel multi-method approaches. The process involves joining the last hidden layers from single-omics models to serve as input for a definitive multi-omics deep neural network (DNN), which is then refined using AutoML to target optimal learning outcomes.

Data integration experiments, utilizing concatenated raw inputs with various methods such as MLP and VAE, demonstrate different F1 score performances, revealing AutoGenome's capability to handle inputs like gene expression and gene mutation effectively. The genes identified by the single-omics models showed enrichment in significant biological processes and pathways relevant to cancer, including metabolic processes, cell proliferation, and signaling pathways.

The accumulation of large-scale multi-omics data alongside patient medical records propels precision medicine forward, allowing for personalized treatment regimens based on individual clinical responses and genomic features. This individualized approach is critical for complex diseases like cancer, where patients with histologically similar cancers might experience varied responses to treatments due to their unique genetic backgrounds.

Moreover, comparative studies were executed for Autoomics-based drug sensitivity models against the PACCMan using GDSC data, considering the cell-wise and drug-wise performances. This work also includes an independent validation using a mice PDX dataset, comparing results with the MOLI model using tumor size reduction as the performance metric.

Critical to the model's effectiveness is the hyper-parameter optimization process, building upon methods previously described in Autogenome. The search space includes parameters like learning rate, batch size, momentum, weight decay, and the architecture of the neural network such as the number of layers and neurons.

For RFCN-DenseNet, the search space involves details of the blocks structure, the growth rate of the neurons, and dropout ratios. In addition, an efficient neural architecture search (ENAS) method is outlined, detailing the parameters from the second layer to the last of the neural network, including the number of neurons and the interconnecting relationships.

In summary, the research proposes a methodological evolution in neural network architecture and AutoML application to harness the complexity of multi-omics data, aiming to move towards more precise and personalized medical solutions.
