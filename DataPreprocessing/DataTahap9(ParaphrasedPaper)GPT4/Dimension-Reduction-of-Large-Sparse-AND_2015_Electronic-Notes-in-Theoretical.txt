Our algorithm targets the simplification of wiring diagrams in large-scale networks without altering the number of steady states, thus allowing for the complete recovery of original network steady states from the reduced ones. Practical tests indicate polynomial runtime for the algorithm. It has been particularly effective in analyzing gene networks through and-not models, streamlining their steady state calculations. The reduced network can be represented compactly by wiring diagrams due to the specific reductions permissible for and-not networks.

Key simplification steps are detailed, focusing on removing nodes with specific types of incoming and outgoing edges, ultimately simplifying the network. The reduction process is iterative and can be performed in various sequences, potentially yielding different reduced networks but with consistent steady state counts. In our approach, the size of the reduced networks correlates logarithmically with original network size, significantly reducing the computational effort needed for steady state calculations, especially in sparse networks.

Existing algorithms often struggle with scalability in network size, prompting a need for tailored reductions for specific network families. Our approach addresses this for and-not networks, a class balancing simplicity for analysis and generality for broad modeling. The algorithm performed excellently on tested and-not network models, achieving massive size reductions and demonstrating scalability to handle networks with up to a million nodes efficiently, a capacity currently unmatched by other algorithms for and-not or similar complexity Boolean networks (BNs).
