The paper presents new technological advancements to support percutaneous cryoablation procedures, specifically a planning software and a simulation algorithm. The planning software is designed to calculate the optimal positioning of the tools to achieve successful ablation of the target lesion while adhering to procedural requirements. Using intra-operative CT scans, a virtual model of the site is created, which the software uses to determine the placement of cryoprobes. The goal is to ensure the iceball that develops encompasses the entire tumor while minimizing harm to adjacent healthy kidney tissue.

The simulation algorithm, on the other hand, serves as a visual tool to evaluate temperature changes during the procedure. It employs a discrete, iterative calculation of heat transfer from the cryoprobes to the tissue within a three-dimensional grid, enabling the identification of critical isotherms and thus helping to predict whether the entire tumor will be effectively frozen.

The tools' accuracy was validated by comparing the volume and shape of the iceball created in a real-world cryoablation procedure with that generated by the simulator, with favorable results. Although these methods were originally intended for use within a robotic system, they are flexible enough to be extended to other scenarios or procedures.

Future work will focus on enhancing these methods by incorporating additional parameters into the simulation algorithm to better account for oversimplified thermal dynamics and interactions. The aim is to integrate the planning software and simulator into a single tool, streamlining the process for operators to plan probe placement and evaluate therapeutic outcomes without needing to switch between different systems.
