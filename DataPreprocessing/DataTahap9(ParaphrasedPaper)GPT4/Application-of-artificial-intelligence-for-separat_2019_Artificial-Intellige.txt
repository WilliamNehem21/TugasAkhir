This study focused on creating an intelligent system based on visual machine technology for distinguishing between living and dead rainbow trout fish eggs. Features were extracted from images of the eggs, which then served as input for classifiers to make decisions. The classifiers employed were the multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLP) and the support vector machine (SVM). A statistical method, the paired t-test, helped to whittle down the number of features from 15 to 10 to enhance classification accuracy. To ensure robust evaluation, a k-fold cross-validation technique was utilized, and the performance of the classifiers was assessed over various training set sizes ranging from 20% to 80%.

During the training phase, both MLP and SVM classifiers achieved perfect classification results with 100% accuracy. In the testing phase, they also performed exceptionally well, averaging 99.45% accuracy, indicating that both classifiers are highly reliable for sorting rainbow trout fish eggs.

In the context of the study, image quality metrics such as energy, contrast, homogeneity, and correlation were defined. Energy measured image smoothness, with squared values accounting for uniform gray levels. Contrast referred to the degree of variation in pixel brightness, with higher differences indicating better quality. Homogeneity described the consistency within image elements, and correlation measured the linear relationship between gray levels in neighboring pixels.

The MLP neural network was further analyzed using a method involving 100 different datasets and 5-fold cross-validation. Three features chosen through sensitivity analysis were employed as inputs for the MLP, leading to flawless separation of living and dead fish eggs during the training phase. The test phase also demonstrated good performance, with an overall precision rate of 99.45% for MLP.

This research presents a robust, highly accurate system for sorting fish eggs that could be valuable in developing automated equipment for this purpose in the food engineering industry.
