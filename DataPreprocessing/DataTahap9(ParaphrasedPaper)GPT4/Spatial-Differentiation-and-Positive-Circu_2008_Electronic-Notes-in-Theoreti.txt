This research paper delves into the association between multistationarity in genetic systems within a single cell and the presence of a positive feedback loop in the cell's regulatory network. It then extends this concept to investigate a similar relationship in the context of spatial differentiation among multiple cells.

The study begins with a simplified model involving cells on a one-dimensional, infinite grid represented by the set of integers (Z), which helps in highlighting the fundamental formalism. Further complexity, such as hexagonal two-dimensional grids and their relation to the development of sensory organs in Drosophila, is discussed as an extension of this initial model.

The main finding is that a positive feedback loop is necessary for the system to achieve multistationarity, characterizing spatial differentiation. Specifically, this is demonstrated via the presence of multiple periodic fixed points where at least one cell shares the same gene expression levels.

The paper emphasizes that regulatory graphs, typically used by biologists to generate dynamic models, can be derived from the dynamics under study. While biologists often begin with regulatory graphs to model dynamics, the authors show that the reverse process—extracting graphs from observed dynamics—is equally valid and compatible.

An illustrative example is provided where a system containing two genes has two distinct fixed points indicating gene expression levels. This serves to confirm the existence of a positive circuit within the regulatory graph based on the theorem presented.

The discussion moves on to systems of interacting cells fixed in position on an infinite one-dimensional grid. The local interactions between cells, where a cell impacts only itself and its neighboring cells, are considered for the evolution of the n genes within each cell. In any given state, these local interactions determine the gene expression tendencies.

The conclusion is drawn that fixed points are the main focus of the research and they are significant regardless of the assumptions made about the dynamics of the system—whether the changes are synchronous or asynchronous, or whether cells evolve in parallel, as proposed by L-systems.

Lastly, the paper provides a proof illustrating that if there are two fixed points with varying periods and these points share a common cell, they fulfill the condition of a positive feedback loop, reinforcing the central concept that positive circuits are necessary for the sort of multistationarity that leads to spatial differentiation.
