The paper discusses the influence of specific parameters on the final characteristics of castings produced through the pressure die-casting process, which can be executed via a cold or hot chamber die-casting machine. In this process, a cold chamber machine uses a holding furnace of critical importance, serving to contain and maintain the molten metal before it is injected at high pressure into a mold.

There are different types of holding furnaces classified according to their power source, including gas, oil, electricity, and induction furnaces, with the latter offering a more energy-efficient and controllable melting and holding process.

The study proposes a method to assess the behavior of the liquid alloy within the melting holding furnace, as well as to detect changes in its chemical composition, which may occur as the alloy is used in different layers, signifying its diminishing level. The method pays special attention to elements like silicon (Si), manganese (Mn), aluminum (Al), and ferrite (Fe), which significantly affect the quality of the final casting properties.

According to the proposed method, it is possible to identify changes such as decreasing element levels, which may reduce the casting's strength and increase potential for leaks. In certain cases, an element like ferrite might accumulate at the bottom of the furnace. The method also helps to establish the ideal weight percentage balance of these elements in each layer, optimizing furnace utilization.

The methodology includes the visual inspection of samples, with contaminated samples being discarded. If exclusion occurs for three consecutive samples or exceeds four samples overall, the sampling process must be repeated.

The study's data suggest a downward trend in the weight percentage of silicon, ferrite, and manganese in the samples evaluated. Weight loss percentages were calculated for each element, revealing manganese experienced the highest loss at around 20.21%, while aluminum showed a -1.2% change, indicating its increase. The weight loss percentages for silicon and ferrite were 6.46% and 9.28%, respectively.
