To refine the precision of the conversion methodologies discussed in the paper, the author proposes several improvements:

1. Utilize the average latitude value as the reference for projection, which may help diminish errors within conversion equations.
2. Instead of adhering to a static elevation value, employ the average elevation to accommodate variations.
3. Employ more advanced GPS technology to capture data with greater accuracy.
4. Implement superior algorithms that could enhance the precision of both conversion and area computations, acknowledging that developing such algorithms is challenging.

The paper discusses advancements in GPS-based methods for measuring land areas, especially those with irregular shapes. Experimental evidence suggests that the GPS instrument in question can perform efficiently and effectively in calculating the area of such terrains. The potential applications of this instrument in various area-related projects are considerable, though not fully quantifiable at this time.
