The integration of Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANET) with Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) within ubiquitous smart environments presents novel opportunities for monitoring broad urban areas, creating a new platform for various Internet of Things (IoT) applications. In this context, sensors gather environmental data and send it to gateway nodes. These nodes, in turn, relay the data to MANET nodes specifically used for data collection. The study examines two IoT applications monitored by wireless sensor nodes, with the primary challenge being to create a unified system combining sensor and MANET networks, which differ in energy capacity, protocols, and may experience co-channel interference. A comprehensive solution is proposed, covering network protocols, frequency distribution, node deployment, MANET routing, movement patterns, and the actual implementation of IoT applications, simulated and validated using the OMNeT++ simulator.

The paper reflects on the broader concept of IoT, where everyday objects, ranging from smartphones to sensors and RFID-tagged devices, can interconnect, forming part of the Internet. IoT aims to make the Internet more pervasive by allowing diverse devices to easily communicate, leading to many applications that process large volumes of data from these devices to make critical decisions or control them directly in areas such as healthcare, home automation, and industrial automation.

Advancements in communication and microcontroller technologies have made WSNs pivotal in IoT, with sensor nodes capable of measuring environmental parameters, storing data temporarily, and communicating with other devices using technologies like IEEE 802.15.4 or Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). RFID tags also play a significant role in IoT by identifying tagged objects.

The paper's structure includes a literature review, discussions on IoT architecture and protocols, illustrations of two IoT applications, followed by simulation results. It then concludes with a summary.

Smart city services such as structural health monitoring, pollution tracking, waste management, traffic control, and smart parking can be facilitated by IoT. Various networked sensors perform continuous data collection for these services, with data sent to the Internet for processing. However, traditional IoT architectures have limitations such as coverage area, network delay, and energy consumption.

To address these challenges, the paper proposes a novel architecture involving hierarchical levels that incorporate MANET nodes, WLAN infrastructure, WSN nodes, and the Internet to optimize IoT applications. By inserting MANET as an intermediary between WSNs and the Internet, the architecture aims to mitigate technical disparities and enhance efficiency. The proposed model's effectiveness is substantiated through qualitative analysis and supported by quantitative results from simulations.

The paper concludes that its model is more energy-efficient and scalable than conventional approaches, suitable for expanding IoT applications at a lower cost. Two IoT applications, hospital management and a soccer game, are discussed in detail to demonstrate the proposed architecture's practicality, including network setup, protocols, sensor communication technologies, and mobile unit models. The study draws upon the REST paradigm proposed by IETF, highlighting the compatibility between conventional web services and IoT services, leveraging applications like EXI and CoAP, which facilitate communication among energy-constrained IoT devices.
