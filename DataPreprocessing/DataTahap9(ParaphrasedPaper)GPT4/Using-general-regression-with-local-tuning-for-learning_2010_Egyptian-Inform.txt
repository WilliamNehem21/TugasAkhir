Abstract Paraphrased:

Finite mixture models (FMMs) are statistical tools used to model complex data distributions, typically estimated through the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. Earlier adaptations of the EM algorithm addressed datasets with missing values, but struggled with issues such as outliers, class overlap, and biased data generation. This paper introduces a new algorithm designed to alleviate these issues, demonstrating its effectiveness over existing methods, including the conventional EM algorithm, especially in the presence of missing data. 

Summary Paraphrased:

Finite mixture models (FMMs) are an established technique in pattern recognition for modeling intricate data distributions. The parameters of these models are often estimated using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. Previous adaptations of the EM algorithm have aimed to estimate parameters for datasets with missing valuesâ€”referred to as the modified EM (MEM) algorithm. However, these adaptations are susceptible to issues such as outliers, overlap between data classes, and biases related to data class generation. Furthermore, the MEM algorithm performs best when the missing value rate is low, and its effectiveness diminishes with small datasets or poor initial model component estimates. 

In this paper, a novel algorithm is proposed to circumvent the limitations of the MEM. The new algorithm, referred to as LGREM, is less sensitive to model assumptions while estimating missing values and less affected by learning issues like outliers or class overlap. It also provides a more accurate and unbiased estimation of missing values and the FMM parameters, as shown in a comparative study. This study clearly indicates that LGREM outperforms both the MEM algorithm and the General Regression Neural Network (GRNN) algorithm, especially in cases of sparse datasets, class overlap, outlier presence, or imbalanced class sizes. The LGREM algorithm leverages local tuning, which enhances performance by being adaptive to data correlations and class sizes.

Overall, the paper advocates for the LGREM algorithm as a superior method for unsupervised learning of FMM parameters in datasets with missing values, outperforming several commonly used alternatives in the literature.
