The academic paper discusses the challenge of seismic inversion, which is an ill-posed problem typically solved using optimization techniques. Researchers have been exploring swarm intelligence (SI) algorithms like differential evolution (DE) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) for their global optimization capabilities. The paper proposes an enhancement to these SI algorithms by incorporating a prior constraint based on the sparse probability distribution (PD) of reflectivity, which is assumed to be static over space. The proposed method integrates the construction of a probability density function (PDF) library and a probability transformation into standard SI algorithms, resulting in two improved algorithms: DE-PD and PSO-PD.

These constrained SI algorithms were tested using numerical examples from the Marmousi2 model and field data on gas hydrates. Results indicate that both DE-PD and PSO-PD provide more accurate seismic inversion solutions than their original counterparts, with DE-PD showing the best performance in terms of mean error and fitness for velocity and impedance inversion. The paper also notes that DE-PD has the highest computational cost, suggesting the potential use of parallel computing with GPUs for acceleration.

The paper highlights that the seismic inverse problem is hard to solve with classical methods like gradient descent due to sensitivity to initial models and a tendency to get trapped in local minima. The proposed method also assumes that in a depositional area, PDFs of reflectivity can be estimated from well logs, and these distributions can be used to constrain the inversion process for greater accuracy.

In outlining the procedure for standard SI algorithms, the paper details three basic steps: initialization of a population of agents, which are potential solutions; evaluation of these agents using a fitness value derived from a misfit function; and updating the population through perturbation of current agents.

In summary, the paper presents an approach to improve SI algorithms for seismic inversion by imposing a sparse PD constraint based on well log data, reporting that the constrained algorithms (DE-PD and PSO-PD) outperform their standard versions in terms of accuracy and convergence speed, despite the increased computation time associated with DE-PD.
