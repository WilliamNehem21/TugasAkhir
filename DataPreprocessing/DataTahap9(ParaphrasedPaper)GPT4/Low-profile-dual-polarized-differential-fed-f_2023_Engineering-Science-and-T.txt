The research paper discusses challenges and advancements in designing a filtering antenna array with high polarization isolation and low sidelobe levels, particularly relevant for 5G base station MIMO array applications.

Initially, the paper notes a problem with mutual coupling in antenna arrays, which can be diminished by inserting an isolation wall, complicating the design. The isolation measured includes influences from both the antenna array and connected power dividers.

Capacitive coupling between radiation and driven patches creates the x-polarization radiation, with the current stronger on the radiation patches, indicating efficient energy transfer from the driven patches.

Furthermore, the study examines the coupling effect using four distinct ports, with analysis based on even and odd modal behaviors of parallel coupling lines.

To assess the polarization isolation performance of the antenna independently of the power divider, two port types are considered, designated as port V for x-polarization and port H for y-polarization. Differential S-parameters between these ports are calculated.

An experimental filtering antenna demonstrates substantial isolation (41 dB) and a peak gain of 10.5 dBi. A novel antenna array design, with shared radiating patches and reduced element spacing, exhibited improved performance, particularly in sidelobe level reduction. The prototype's isolation related to the polarization ports is also high, at 41.1 dB, highlighting the array's suitability for 5G base station MIMO applications due to its radiation and filtering efficacy.
