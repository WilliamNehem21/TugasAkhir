Here's a paraphrased version of the provided academic paper definitions:

Definition 2.4: An Oracle Turing Machine (OTM) is a type of Turing Machine with an added oracle tape and three specialized states: q_query, q_yes, and q_no. When an OTM enters the q_query state, it checks the contents of the oracle tape. If those contents are part of the oracle set, it transitions to q_yes; otherwise, it moves to q_no.

Definition 2.6: Consider an OTM M that operates within a polynomial time (poly-time) constraint. M can be reinterpreted as a probabilistic poly-time Turing Machine if we randomize the selection of the oracle from the possible oracle space constrained by M's time limit. Specifically, if M runs within a polynomial time limit represented by q, it is limited to querying the oracle with a maximum of q(x) bits, defining a finite set of potential oracles. We refer to this set as the space.

Definition 2.16: Given a process expression p and a term t, the term t is considered "exposed" if no input operator encompasses it. Likewise, for a subexpression [t1 = t2].r in p, if [t1 = t2].r is outside the scope of any input operators, it is deemed an "exposed match."

Definition 2.23: If process expressions p and q are given, and cp(|n|) represents a channel, then we say that p is bound by cp(|n|) within q if cp(|n|)(x).d[p] is a subprocess within q for some variable x and context expression d[].

Definition 2.24: For a context c[] and a process p, the context c[] is considered minimal for p if it binds every free variable in p and each channel that binds p within c[p] also binds a free variable in p.

For the remaining excerpt:
The Poly-time Turing Machine (PTM) evaluates each "exposed" term it encounters by using the corresponding algorithm at the values given by the substitution instance. For match evaluation, the machine simply compares two terms and determines the outcome. Likewise, the PTM assesses bound processes from an external perspective.

The computational effort of the PTM to evaluate process p depends on two factors: the length of process p, and the individual costs of assessing each "exposed" term encountered. The length of p is determined as specified in Definition 4.8.

Finally, regarding the security concerns, it is noted that effective security requires sufficiently large parameter n to avoid the potential of brute force attacks, which can compromise any security system given a small enough search space. There is the implication that elevating the security level (increasing parameter n) will prevent brute force attacks that could otherwise differentiate between two process families or breach one protocol but not the other.
