In this paper, the authors address the challenge of conducting symbolic model checking on safety properties of parametrized systems that have a linear structure. These systems involve configurations and actions that can be defined by regular languages and regular relations respectively. The verification of such systems hinges on calculating their reachability sets. The authors propose a method termed "regular widening" that, if successful, can determine the reachability set of a system or the transitive closure of a regular relation. This method can be applied broadly across different types of parametrized systems.

Emphasis is placed on work with distributed systems where the number of processes isn't fixed, requiring parametrized verification. The inherent undecidability of verifying these systems necessitates limiting the focus to decidable sub-classes or designing semi-algorithms without guaranteed termination. This paper aligns with the latter, introducing a semi-decision procedure that specifically targets safety properties of linear parametrized systems.

The authors compare their method to existing techniques and demonstrate its potential through applications, including the verification of the Burns protocol. The approach is termed "regular widening" because it employs a widening strategy to approximate the impact of repeatedly applying a regular relation to a regular language. It proposes different widening principles, suitable for various scenarios where the relation and the language may interact in complex ways.

The proposed widening techniques work by detecting patterns in the application of a relation to a language and inferring loops or repetitions that may arise in continued applications. These principles are extended and adjusted to cover a range of situations and system classes, with an aim to compute or approximate the reachability set accurately. When applicable, the widening technique ensures that the result is a superset of the actual reachability set, thereby preserving safety properties.

Finally, the authors have developed a prototype tool based on the MONA system to experiment with the regular widening technique and they share insights from using it to check several mutual exclusion protocols. While initial implementations have focused on elementary principles, results are promising, demonstrating the potential of regular widening to facilitate model checking in complex parametrized systems.
