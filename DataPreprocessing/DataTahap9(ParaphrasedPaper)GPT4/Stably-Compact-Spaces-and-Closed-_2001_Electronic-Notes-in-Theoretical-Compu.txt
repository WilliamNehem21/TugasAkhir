The paper discusses two main points of interest in the context of domain theory, particularly with an emphasis on extending and refining the understanding of fs-domains and closed relations.

Firstly, the authors express a motivation to address challenges in classical domain theory, noting that a specific type of continuous domain known as fs-domains can only be included within a cartesian closed category when restricted to a certain subcategory. Unlike more general continuous domains, fs-domains lack a simple characterization through their Stone dual—a concept from topology that provides a correspondence between certain topological spaces and algebraic structures. Current analytical tools for fs-domains are limited, leaving several fundamental questions about their nature and properties unresolved, such as whether they are equivalent to retracts of bifinite domains or how the probabilistic powerdomain fits within this category.

Secondly, the paper introduces the concept of the Stone duality of closed relations. Closed relations between open set lattices are found to correspond to preframe homomorphisms, which are known to preserve finite meets and directed suprema, and have been previously studied in similar contexts. However, the duality aspect relating to the closed relations itself appears to be a novel contribution. This development builds upon established notions of function duality for stably compact spaces—or more broadly, for locally compact sober spaces. The paper highlights that whereas the Stone dual of a function has an upper adjoint, characterizing perfectness in classical settings can be refined by the continuation of the adjoint's Scott-continuity. The authors conclude by revealing that, as indicated by Corollary 3.7, a continuous function between stably compact spaces is classically considered perfect if and only if the associated relation derived from the hypergraph conforms with their definition of perfectness.
