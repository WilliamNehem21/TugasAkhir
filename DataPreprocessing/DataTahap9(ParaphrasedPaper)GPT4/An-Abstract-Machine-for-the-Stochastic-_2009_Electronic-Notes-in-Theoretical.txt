This academic article introduces an abstract computational model for the stochastic bioambient calculus, a framework designed to simulate complex biological systems with spatial dynamics. The new abstract machine is demonstrated to be accurate in modeling stochastic processes, meaning it faithfully represents the probabilities of different reactions occurring within the calculus. To guarantee the reliability of simulations, it aligns with a newly proposed stochastic semantics and preserves the expected reaction probabilities.

Following advancements to expand the stochastic pi-calculus with features that better represent biological system structures, the bioambient calculus was created to encapsulate the behavior of dynamic cellular compartments, while the brane calculus modeled mobile membrane actions. For these models to be useful, precise simulation is crucial, much like the accuracy required by the Gillespie algorithm's principles, a standard method for simulating biochemical systems.

The paper discusses a pre-existing bioambient calculus simulator and acknowledges its utility in validating models. However, it also highlights a disparity between the theoretical calculus and the practical simulation algorithm. The implication is that for these models to be effective, the accuracy of both the simulation algorithm and the calculus it represents should be regarded with equal importance.

The structure of the model includes a global environment containing definitions for various processes and a tree representing the hierarchical relationships within the biological system. Each possible action within the system is carefully linked to predefined species in the environment, allowing for standardized population grouping.

To emphasize the reliability of the abstract machine, the paper presents two theorems (Theorem 3.14 and Theorem 3.15) that confirm the consistency between the abstract machine's and the calculus's probability of reactions. The proofs of these theorems are based on establishing a one-to-one correspondence between the reactions modeled by the stochastic bioambient calculus and those by the abstract machine.

Overall, this paper assures that the implementation of the abstract machine extends a previous simulator for the stochastic pi-calculus and underscores the significance of accurately capturing stochastic behavior in computational models of biological systems.
