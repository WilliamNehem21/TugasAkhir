The paper discusses how information theory and specifically the concept of a noisy channel have been successfully applied to the field of information security. The noisy channel model is used to understand protocols designed for concealing information and analyzing the flow of information within computer programs. In this model, the channel's input represents confidential information that needs to be protected, while the channel's output corresponds to what can be observed by others. The channel's noise is introduced by security mechanisms aiming to obscure the relationship between confidential inputs and observable outputs, often through the use of randomization strategies.

The paper then addresses the challenge of measuring the amount of information and, by extension, the notion of uncertainty. Two distinct methods for quantifying information leakage are considered. The first approach, which aligns with Smith's proposal, results in what is termed a "multiplicative" notion of leakage. The second approach, which is presented as a new idea, leads to an "additive" notion of leakage.

Further, the paper examines the multiplicative notion of leakage, referred to as ML+. The authors highlight an important result, Corollary 6.5, which indicates that the maximum multiplicative leakage value (ML+) is attained at what is known as a corner point. This corner point corresponds to a probability distribution described by a series of values (q1,..., q2k), where each value qi is either 0 or 1/r. In this distribution, exactly r elements have the value of 1/r, indicating a specific kind of uniform distribution among those r elements within the probability space.
