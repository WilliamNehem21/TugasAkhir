Renewable energy sources (RES) are seen as domestically available resources that have the potential to diminish or entirely substitute the use of fossil fuels in the future. They are key to the protection and sustainable growth of national economies, as they offer a strategy to mitigate the economic impact of rising costs associated with importing fuels, as well as expenses linked to remediating environmental damage. Renewable energy technologies are generally environmentally friendly, producing minimal to no waste, avoiding the generation of radioactive byproducts, and carrying no significant disaster risk. They are foundational to the pursuit of sustainable development in energy, thereby ensuring a more favorable outlook for succeeding generations.

The capacity for harnessing RES varies from country to country, necessitating a tailored approach to determine the most efficient energy sources for a specific nation. This is predominantly because the geographic and environmental conditions of each country influence the feasibility and efficiency of different RES types.

Projections for Slovakia indicate that by 2020, hydroelectric power plants will have the greatest installed capacity, followed by wind, photovoltaic, biomass, and geothermal energy sources. In the Czech Republic, the leading position in installed capacity is expected to be held by photovoltaic energy in 2020, with hydropower, wind, biomass, and geothermal trailing. Germany is projected to have substantial installed capacity in photovoltaics first, then wind, biomass, hydropower, and geothermal energy. Conversely, in Great Britain, the lowest installed capacity will be in hydropower by 2020, while wind energy will take the top spot, followed by biomass and photovoltaic energy sources.
