Most models for analyzing malware, such as SEIR, SIR, SIRD, ESIRD, SISL, SIRS-L, SILRD, and others, are adaptations of the foundational SIR model. Mathematical models used to represent problems or phenomena like malware and network issues rely on a set of simplifying assumptions that are directly related to the specific characteristics of the malware, the network's weaknesses, and security breaches. These models facilitate the analysis of complex networks, which could be heterogeneous networks, LSTM networks, or machine-to-machine communication networks, drawing from a well-structured classical framework like the SIR model. Our study presents a sophisticated network model that captures the dynamics of multiple types of infections, denoted by the terms T(t), E1(t), E2(t), I1(t), I2(t), R(t), and V(t). To refine the original SEIR-V model, we introduce new subcategories within the exposed and infectious classifications.

Wireless sensor network (WSN) environments are influenced by numerous stochastic elements, such as varying temperatures, physical barriers that impact range and the distance between devices, and environmental disturbances. These can include latency due to high levels of network traffic or the large-scale transmission of data, both of which can be unpredictable. Beyond deterministic processes, many environmental influences entail uncertainties and inherently possess random characteristics. This is observable in areas such as network traffic, unforeseen equipment failures, malicious attacks by black hat hackers using malware, network variability due to factors like increasing error rates, the individual quality parameters of devices, and the introduction of open-source tools. Given the recurrent nature of these random factors within network processes, it becomes important to investigate the impact a stochastic environment might have on the behavior and management of network systems.
