This paper presents a new computational framework called Process Algebra with Hooks (PAH), which is a multi-layered modeling approach that integrates different abstraction layers, from biochemical reactions to tissue structures, and incorporates an explicit concept of geometric space. PAH aims to formalize models of pattern formation rooted in Turing's early morphogenesis work, focusing on the local interactions and diffusion of molecules that lead to pattern generation based on their concentrations. The paper outlines PAH's main contributions, including a bottom-up synchronization mechanism using hook actions to maintain coherence between different abstraction layers, and a stochastic semantics for precisely predicting the outcomes of pattern formation processes.

The paper is organized to introduce PAH through examples and formal definitions, before showcasing how to apply PAH to model biochemical interactions and providing a case study. Finally, the paper discusses related work and future goals. Additional details, such as formal definitions and the stochastic semantics, are deferred to appendices in the interest of conciseness.

The novel aspect of PAH lies in its ability to efficiently manage and abstract the various complexities of biological modeling by using layers and hooks to manage interactions across these layers, ultimately creating a flexible and detailed approach to represent and analyze the intricate processes underlying biological pattern formation.
