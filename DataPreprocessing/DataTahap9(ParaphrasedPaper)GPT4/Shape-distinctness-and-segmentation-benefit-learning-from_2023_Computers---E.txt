The paper explores whether realism in educational visualizations should be considered as extraneous cognitive load that doesn't contribute to learning outcomes. The research builds on cognitive load theory, positing that working memory has limited capacity for managing relevant (intrinsic) and irrelevant (extraneous) cognitive loads, and suggests that learning is improved when extraneous load is minimized to focus on intrinsic load.

The findings indicate that realism's effect on learning may differ based on task requirements. For instance, learning mitosis wasn't improved by more realistic visuals, but understanding shapes was enhanced by realism, especially when objects had a high dimensionality as opposed to being presented as flat cross-sections.

The studies investigate the "alignment hypothesis," which stipulates that realistic details are only beneficial when they lead to specific advantages, taking into account the dimensionality and perspective of visualizations. Experiment 1 looked at the relationship between realism and the dimensionality of objects, presuming that a match should result in lower cognitive load and better retention. The results were mixed, with some support for the hypothesis at a descriptive level.

Experiment 2 examined the interplay between realism and perspective, predicting that realistic renderings would aid learning of perspective views, but didn't find significant results, though patterns in the data suggested the hypothesis might be correct on a descriptive level.

Experiment 3 aimed to clarify how realistic visualizations can support learning by focusing on meaningful design features like geometry and shading. It found that higher shape distinctness and color coding, which aids segmentation, could reduce cognitive load and enhance learning. The study provided evidence that distinct shapes and visual segmentation guides should be emphasized in realistic visualizations.

The findings are useful for designers creating static visualizations and can guide future research in extended reality (XR) environments. For XR applications, the choice between detailed and less detailed models may depend on whether the perspective emphasizes dimensionality.

Finally, the paper notes that future studies should consider age as a factor, given that age-related differences might affect how learners benefit from realism, and suggests replicating the studies with diverse age groups beyond the university students (aged 18-30) initially studied.
