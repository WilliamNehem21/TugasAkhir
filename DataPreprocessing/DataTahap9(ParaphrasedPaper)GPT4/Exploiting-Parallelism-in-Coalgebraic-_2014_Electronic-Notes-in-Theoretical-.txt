We demonstrate a concurrent version of Coalgebraic Logic Programming (CoALP) using the Go programming language. CoALP, which imparts a coalgebraic interpretation to logic programming, offers a derivation algorithm that incorporates both corecursion and concurrent execution capabilities. Our discussion revolves around how the coalgebraic perspective informed the development of a concurrent logic programming model.

The endofunctor PF PF inherently includes a cofree comonad C(PF PF), as identified in prior research. A logic program represented as a PF PF-coalgebra can have its SLD-derivations captured by a comonad C(PF PF). Crucially, for a ground (variable-free) logic program P, the C(PF PF)-coalgebra structure encapsulates the derivation trees, facilitating simultaneous and/or derivations and the possibility of parallel execution.

During our transformation pass, empty references in and-node lists are identified and subsequently populated with clause-tree root nodes that match them, setting the stage for efficient query processing. It's worth noting that this configuration process is a one-time setup.

Implementing restricted (ground) logic programs not only has inherent value but also translates variable-containing programs without higher arity function symbols into finitely-presented ground programs. Datalog is a salient example of such a language characterized by straightforward implementation and enhanced potential for concurrent processing, always yielding finite models.

However, increasing the number of expansion threads doesn't always result in better performance. The key is to engage each thread with a sufficiently large section of the tree to justify the overhead. Balancing work distribution is challenging, especially with trees of uneven structure, as misallocating threads to smaller sections can lead to inefficiency and longer execution times.

We also explore adapting our coalgebraic framework to handle general first-order logic cases. Given that unification and SLD-resolution algorithms are P-complete, achieving significant parallel speedup is not typically feasible. This complexity is exemplified by the fact that parallelization does not always effectively reduce computational time.

Optimizing the construction of coinductive trees is achieved by pre-empting fruitless searches. If a root node doesn't match terms, any references to it can be dismissed immediately, and related pruning and copying tasks can run concurrently without conflict.

Our approach includes a structured work queue, which can either prioritize depth-first (stack-based) or breadth-first (queue-based) search strategies. Depth-first resembles Prolog's method, while breadth-first aligns with CoALP's strategy.

By accumulating solutions sorted by their derivation step count, once all active threads are at the same or greater step depth, it releases solutions from a priority queue. Idle workers and an empty work queue signal completion, yielding all remaining solutions. However, the system might continue to process (co)recursively without a predefined endpoint.

CoALP is capable of uncovering solutions not accessible through a Prolog-like system with a deterministic depth-first search, illustrating its broadened search capabilities and the nuanced solution sets it can generate.
