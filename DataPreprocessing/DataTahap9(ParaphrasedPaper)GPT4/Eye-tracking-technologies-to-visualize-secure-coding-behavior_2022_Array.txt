Secure coders focus on identifying and mitigating security risks in programming code by examining syntax, semantics, program flow, and execution. Their diverse skills and approaches can lead to varying efficiency in discovering and fixing vulnerabilities. As the importance of secure coding grows, so does the need to understand coders' behaviors and better tailor educational content.

The study uses eye tracking to explore coders' engagement with multiple tasks, such as reading documentation, writing code, and using security tools, often switching rapidly between them. By providing a realistic coding environment where participants could interact with documents, code files, and web searches, the study aimed to observe natural coding behavior.

The paper discusses secure coding and associated educational material, general eye tracking information, and current visualization techniques. It then outlines the stimuli used in the study's secure coding modules, which escalate in complexity from identifying to mitigating vulnerabilities, referencing industry-standard sources like CWE and OWASP.

Eye tracking data, including fixations and saccades, provide insights into coders' attention and cognitive processes. The study employs visualization techniques to comprehend this data, despite challenges posed by dynamic and interactive stimuli, which existing methods struggle to accommodate. The paper highlights the importance of adaptable analysis techniques, including a hands-on approach with non-linear stimuli, which better reflect real-world coding.

Secure coders' behavior is observed through tasks that require understanding of security vulnerabilities and code modification. Findings suggest that secure coding behavior is nuanced and individualized, indicating a need for improved understanding and educational strategies to enhance secure coding practices. The paper contributes to the field by investigating visualization methods for dynamic and interactive stimuli, which can help uncover patterns in secure coders' behavior and strategies.
