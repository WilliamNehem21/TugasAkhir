This paper presents a simplified classification system for regular factorial languages, accompanied by thorough proofing. Previously, a classification method had been proposed for a broader set of regular languages based on the least complex decision trees required for nondeterministic recognition, but that approach lacked detailed proofs. The current paper offers new findings associated with decision trees that address the membership problem for regular factorial languages.

Additionally, this research analyzes two different regular languages with regard to their complexity attributes. For these languages, the function that counts the number of words of a given length in the language grows at a linear rate. However, when it comes to the minimum depth of decision trees required for deterministic recognition of these languages, distinctive patterns emerge. For the first language, the complexity of decision trees increases logarithmically with the size of the words. In contrast, for the second language, the complexity of the decision trees increases linearly.

The paper emphasizes that every regular language can be expressed using a deterministic finite automaton (DFA). The study not only considers complete DFAs, which have a total transition function, but also includes partial DFAs, which operate with a partial transition function. These different types of DFAs can be depicted using what is called a transition diagram.
