Research has investigated the use of endophytes, which produce extracellular enzymes, for various applications. These enzymes help endophytes draw nutrients from their host, break down food resources, and play a role in triggering host defense responses to pathogens. Given the pressing need to identify and harness new enzymes that are highly stable for use in industrial operations, this study focuses on evaluating the variety of endophytic fungal communities and their capacity to synthesize extracellular enzymes in certain plant species.
