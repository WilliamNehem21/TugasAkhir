The provided text is a condensed version of an academic paper that addresses verification of program properties for functional logic programming (FLP) with non-deterministic functions. The prior efforts mentioned in the paper concern the first comprehensive framework for the verification process based on the Constructor-based Rewriting Logic (CRWL), a well-established semantics model for FLP.

The text highlights the challenge of applying the rewriting logic semantics for non-determinism, which is inherently different in FLP due to the call-time choice criterion, as opposed to the run-time choice in rewriting logic. It mentions the mapping of CRWL into first-order logic (FOL) as a basis for their approach, exemplifying the mapping with the semantics of non-deterministic functions and their denotations.

Finally, it outlines future work that involves establishing effective conditions for determinism, exploring weaker definitions of determinism that could expand the deterministic portion of the programs, thereby making property proving more efficient. It also proposes to develop case studies to better assess the proposed methods, noting that such evaluation was previously impractical due to the complexity of proof in earlier approaches.
