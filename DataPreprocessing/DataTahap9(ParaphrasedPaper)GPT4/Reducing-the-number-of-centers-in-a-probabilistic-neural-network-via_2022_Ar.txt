This academic paper discusses the structure and training of radial basis function (RBF) networks, focusing on the determination of the number and placement of RBF units. The paper highlights that in a three-layer RBF network, the third layer computes its output by taking a weighted linear combination of activations from the second layer. The weights from the first to the second layer are set to unity.

A key aspect of training RBF networks is selecting the appropriate number of RBF units (m) and determining their center vectors (ci). To accomplish this, clustering algorithms such as k-means or Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) are commonly used. Both these methods start with an initial arbitrary set of m prototypes from the training dataset. These prototypes are iteratively refined, with k-means operating in an unsupervised fashion and LVQ in a supervised manner, until they converge to the final center locations used in the RBF network.

The paper also notes that recent advancements have been made to improve the k-means algorithm, especially to better handle data with heavy tails or outliers. The Orthogonal Least Squares (OLS) method is mentioned as another approach for determining center locations based on an orthogonal transformation of the training data.

Furthermore, the paper mentions evolutionary computation methods like Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) have gained popularity in the last two decades for determining centroids.

Additionally, the paper describes a hierarchical clustering approach where the levels of hierarchy influence the granularity of data representation and, consequently, network performance. As one moves up the hierarchy, the number of cluster means reduces due to the agglomerative nature of the method, often leading to a coarser representation and potentially lower performance. Therefore, a balance must be struck between performance and the number of RBF units within the network when choosing at which hierarchy level to derive the cluster means that will serve as the centroid vectors for the RBF network.
