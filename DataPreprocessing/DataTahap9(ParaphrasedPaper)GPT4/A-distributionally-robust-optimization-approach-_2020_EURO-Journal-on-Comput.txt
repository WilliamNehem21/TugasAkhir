This paper addresses a problem in determining the best locations for facilities when demand is uncertain and there's incomplete information about that uncertainty. The authors propose a two-stage model that includes both choosing facility locations and operating decisions, with the focus on being robust to demand uncertainty. They work under the assumption that not all statistical details about the demand are known but use whatever information is available (like moments of the distribution) to construct a set of potential distributions. Decisions are made based on the worst-case scenario from this set.

The authors suggest two computational methods to solve this robust facility location problem. The first method is a semi-infinite programming approach, which simplifies to a manageable number of constraints using techniques like Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) and Monte Carlo sampling. The second method is a semi-definite programming approach that uses mean and correlation data of uncertain demand for optimization.

Performed numerical tests indicate that the distributionally robust solutions provide flexibility by accounting for the risk associated with uncertain demand, compared to more traditional deterministic or stochastic methods. The robust solutions tend to plan for higher capacity to cope with potential variations in demand, resulting in higher upfront costs but offering long-term resilience.

Looking ahead, the authors suggest that further research could broaden the scope of their approach to problems involving uncertainties in supply, multiple stages, or competition. They also express an interest in applying their robust optimization techniques to real-world situations with similar issues, like locating wind farms or LNG storage facilities.
