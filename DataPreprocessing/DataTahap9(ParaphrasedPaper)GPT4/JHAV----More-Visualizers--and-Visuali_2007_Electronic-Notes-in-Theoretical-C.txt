Creating visual representations of algorithms doesn't necessarily require students to program the algorithms themselves. Tools like ANIMAL and AlVis offer specialized resources for designing these visualizations. Users can design visual depictions of an algorithm's process from a purely conceptual standpoint, akin to making a film about the algorithm, without the need to implement the actual code.

These visualization tools include information and pseudo-code windows, which function like HTML windows. Designers can produce static or dynamic content within these windows to clarify the graphical representation's meaning. While the information window provides overarching conceptual details, the pseudo-code window can exhibit an algorithm's structured outline, spotlighting lines that correspond to the current visual display.

Input generators are another feature that solicits data from users, in cases where the visualization adapts to different inputs as mentioned earlier. This data is used within the visualization to demonstrate if a user's data affects the imagery as expected.

The server application's role encompasses managing the list of algorithms and crafting the visualization scripts that the client showcases. Typically, a student kicks off their experience by initiating the client application which curates a selection of algorithms pertinent to their field of study. The visualization engines are integrated within the client's software.

In terms of animation, some visual objects can render the visualization as a fluid, animated film rather than as a series of individual frames like a slideshow. While the slideshow is the default presentation style, tools such as ANIMAL and AnimalScript enable more advanced animation effects.
