This paper discusses the application of social network analysis (SNA) techniques to understand team dynamics and player roles in the context of cricket. Using the principles of SNA, where players are represented as nodes and their interactions as edges, the paper explores methods for measuring a player's integration and performance within a team.

The authors focus on T-20 cricket, a short form of the game where each side has a single innings of 20 overs. The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 reviews related work, Section 3 presents the proposed approach for forming a cricket team by leveraging small-world network characteristics and analyzing player centrality and clustering coefficients. Section 4 evaluates the approach based on the Indian Premier League (IPL) T-20 season of 2016. Section 5 discusses and compares this approach to other team formation methods. The paper concludes in Section 6.

Small-world networks are essential, as they are characterized by relatively short distances (i.e., hops) between nodes despite most nodes not being directly connected. Key players in such networks bridge these gaps, thus playing a significant role.

The clustering coefficient of a player within the cricket network indicates their influence in forming tightly-knit groups with other players, suggesting high levels of mutual influence. This concept, derived from the work of Watts and Strogatz, measures the extent to which a player contributes to creating a cohesive group or clique. It ranges from 0 (no clustering) to 1 (maximum clustering).

The paper also discusses degree distribution, a fundamental centrality measure. A node's degree is the sum of its connections (edges), with distinctions between incoming and outgoing connections in directed graphs, or represented as a sum in undirected or weighted networks.

An interesting finding highlighted in the paper is the composition of the Royal Challengers Bangalore team, which had a strong batting lineup from the pool of players suggested by the proposed method but lacked notable bowlers from the same pool. Despite this imbalance, the team performed well and qualified for the IPL 2016 finals, although with a weaker bowling component. Analysis of other teams showed a correlation between the inclusion of players from the proposed best teams and their overall success in the tournament, with Rising Pune Supergiant being an exception.

In summary, the paper proposes a method for analyzing and selecting key players for cricket teams using social network analysis to assist in team formation, with the potential to impact performance outcomes in team sports like cricket.
