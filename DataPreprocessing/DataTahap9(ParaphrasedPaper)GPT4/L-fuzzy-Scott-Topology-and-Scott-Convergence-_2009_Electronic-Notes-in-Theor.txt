Domain theory, initially developed by Dana Scott in the 1960s, provides a mathematical framework for understanding the semantics of various programming languages, including imperative, functional, nondeterministic, and probabilistic ones. Building on this work, the concepts of fuzzy directed complete partial orders (fuzzy dcpos) and fuzzy Scott-continuous maps have been introduced for an arbitrary frame L, which must be an order-preserving map that maintains the joins of fuzzy directed sets.

Within this context, the discussed research presents the definition and exploration of an L-fuzzy topology on fuzzy dcpos, termed the L-fuzzy Scott topology. This topology is the fuzzy equivalent of the traditional Scott topology. Additionally, the paper explores the convergence properties for a type of filters known as stratified L-filters within this framework, paralleling traditional concepts from Scott topology in the realm of fuzzy sets and topology.
