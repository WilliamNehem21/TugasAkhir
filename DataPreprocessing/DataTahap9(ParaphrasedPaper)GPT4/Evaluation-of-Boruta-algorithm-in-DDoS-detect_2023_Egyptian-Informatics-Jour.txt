Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks employ numerous dispersed sources to overwhelm target systems such as servers or networks with traffic. These attacks have escalated as more organizations and individuals use the internet to share critical data, enticing attackers to disrupt online services by halting access for legitimate users. The first notable instances of DDoS attacks occurred in 1999, affecting various firms, and since then, the frequency of such attacks has increased.

In response, security experts have been experimenting with detection methods, including machine learning-based intelligent prediction models that classify features from security event data, enhancing detection performance. However, a vast number of dataset features can impede machine learning by slowing down training and analysis.

A Denial of Service (DoS) attack, in contrast, uses a single computer and internet connection to disrupt network services, leading to substantial losses. These attacks are simpler to execute and are available to less skilled attackers. Several common DoS attacks include volumetric attacks, SYN flooding, fragmentation attacks, TCP state exhaustion, and application layer attacks.

Anomaly-based methods profile normal network activity and create systems that learn from data, enabling them to predict based on learned patterns. This approach can detect new and unknown attacks, as well as both malicious and benign events.

DDoS attacks are identified using soft computing methods like fuzzy reasoning and artificial neural networks, which excel at handling known and supervised attacks. Machine learning-based methods that learn and improve task performance encompass various techniques, such as genetic algorithms, Bayesian methods, neural networks, support vector machines, and fuzzy logic. These methods are adaptable and can capture interdependencies.

The Boruta algorithm, devised by Polish researchers Witold Rudnicki and Miron Kursa, selects vital features in a dataset using a wrapper around random forest. It generates shuffled copies of features and employs a random forest classifier to rank their importance.

Unsupervised learning uses unlabeled data to uncover patterns for clustering and association. In contrast, supervised learning leverages labeled datasets to train models for accurate predictions and classifications on unseen data, encompassing classification and regression tasks.

The random forest, known for its robust classification capabilities, combines numerous decision trees and is effective in predicting new data. Scikit-learn employs it for feature importance evaluation using the Gini index. Decision trees like ID3 and C4.5 (implemented as J48 in Weka) are also used for accurate predictions and handling data attributes.

Multilayer perceptrons (MLP) use supervised learning to minimize prediction error and are capable of generalization. Despite being resilient to neuron and connection failures, MLPs have training limitations, including possible underfitting or overfitting depending on the number of hidden neurons.

Feature selection is a crucial phase where irrelevant features are eliminated to enhance model accuracy using filter, wrapper, or embedded methods.

The random forest algorithm demonstrated the highest accuracy in detecting DDoS attacks. It can be tuned by adjusting the number of iterations (trees) and the maximum depth of those trees. However, while the Boruta algorithm aids in optimal feature selection, its lengthy run times pose challenges due to the large feature set in the dataset.
