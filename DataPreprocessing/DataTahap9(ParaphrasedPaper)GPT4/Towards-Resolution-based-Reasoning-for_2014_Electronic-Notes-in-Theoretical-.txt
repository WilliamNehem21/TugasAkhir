The paper discusses the significant interest in the methodology of joining different logics within the fields of knowledge representation and ontology, noting its benefits like intuitive semantics, modularity, and maintenance of decidability. The authors indicate that, until now, reasoning within connected logics was only possible by converting them into more complex logics. This paper introduces a straightforward, modal variation of basic e-connections along with a sound, complete, and terminating resolution-based reasoning method to tackle this form of logic integration.

The authors highlight that e-connections have successfully been utilized to merge various description logics, and resolution has proven effective in such contexts. The reasoning procedure they propose maintains separate calculi for each logic component, while introducing new resolution rules to address the satisfiability issue in connected logics utilizing k-bridge modalities. The method is flexible, allowing for expansion to more elaborate e-connections.

Outlining the paper, Section 2 describes the syntax and semantics of multi-modal logic K(n), Section 3 defines a basic modal version of e-connections, and Section 4 details the resolution method for connected logics with examples. Section 5 discusses the proofs of correctness, and Section 6 reviews results and related work.

The authors explain that e-connections allow separate interpretation domains for connected logics to be linked by relations and present a union language enriched with operators for these links. When connecting two multimodal logics L1 and L2 with distinct propositional variables and modal operators, they use the same boolean operators for simplicity but may explore non-classical logic combinations in future work.

The paper goes on to show that bridge modalities follow rules such as necessitation and that they are k-modalities. Therefore, e-connections don't introduce new principles but follow existing modal logic axioms.

A resolution-based calculus for connected modular logics, called RESE, is formulated. Formulas are first translated into a normal form, and then inference rules are applied until either a contradiction is found or no new clauses can be generated. The calculus contains rules for propositional and multimodal parts of each logic and rules for the connections between them.

Correctness, termination, and completeness are discussed: soundness is guaranteed by preserving satisfiability during rule application; termination is due to the finiteness of propositional symbols and clauses; completeness is affirmed if an unsatisfactory clause set leads to a refutation by RESE.

The proposed resolution method separates reasoning into different dimensions, with specialized rules for different language sections ensuring that component logic calculi remain independent. Bridge modalities are handled through inference rules that connect modalities from one logic with literal clauses from another.

In conclusion, the authors believe this method can be extended to handle more complex logic connections. Complete resolution procedures could be developed for connecting theories with corresponding frame properties, applicable not only to classical modal logics but potentially also to non-classical logics like intuitionistic, relevant, or paraconsistent logic.
