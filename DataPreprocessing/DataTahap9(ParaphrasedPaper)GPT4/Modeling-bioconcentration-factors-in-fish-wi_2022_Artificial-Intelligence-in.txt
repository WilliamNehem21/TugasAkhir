This academic paper discusses the development of predictive models for estimating the bioconcentration factor (BCF), which indicates the extent to which chemicals accumulate in the tissues of living organisms, particularly fish. BCF is quantified as the ratio of a substance's concentration in an organism to its concentration in the surrounding water, normalized to 5% lipid content for consistency, with fish like fathead minnow, bluegill sunfish, and rainbow trout as common test subjects.

For modeling, the researchers used BCF data from 1,056 compounds collated from multiple datasets by Grisoni et al., including 45 substances known for particular metabolic pathways or partitioning behavior. To test the models, they compiled an external dataset with BCF values from the Pesticide Properties DataBase (PPDB), omitting entries not meeting quality criteria or with significant stereochemical variation. After further validation and correction, this resulted in 80 molecules for the test set.

Models were trained using 512-dimensional descriptors (without preprocessing) generated by a method called CDDD, although this led to the exclusion of about 3% of molecules not fitting within CDDD's applicability domain. Nested cross-validation was used to train models and optimize hyperparameters, ensuring robust performance evaluation and avoidance of bias.

The study employed machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Regressor (SVR), Random Forest (RF), and XGBoost using the CDDD descriptors as input features. The SVR combined with CDDD descriptors was found to be particularly effective for predicting BCF.

To interpret the BCF model, the investigators utilized perturbation-based methods which assess the importance of individual characters in the Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) representations of molecules. This approach is gradient-free and thus widely applicable across different modeling techniques.

However, only the VEGA read-across model surpassed their XBCF model, and this was limited to molecules within the training set's applicability domain, while their XBCF model was evaluated on a full set of molecules, making it useful for predicting BCF values for new chemical classes.

The researchers introduced perturbation methods to generate scores reflecting the importance of each atom in a molecule's structure, providing insights into model-based predictions. Interestingly, the importance scores vary based on the molecular context represented by different SMILES strings.

The paper reveals that the prediction model provides an explainability layer, improving the value and trustworthiness of their predictions, aiding molecular design, and helping to understand the bioaccumulation process. In addition, the authors compared the sensitivity scores they derived to correction factors from established group contribution models like KOWWIN.

In conclusion, the study developed a data-driven model for predicting both BCF and logD (a measure of lipophilicity), showcasing its predictive accuracy and generalizability. The explanations derived from the model focus on alterations to individual SMILES characters and should not be mistaken for incremental contribution factors that sum up to the molecule's overall prediction.
