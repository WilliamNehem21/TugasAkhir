In our case study, we apply a rule to verify the safety of a powertrain control system. The system we analyze is based on a simplified model designed to regulate the air-to-fuel (A/F) ratio in a gasoline engine, aiming to keep it close to an optimal level. We detail the overall proof and emphasize the significance of the forward invariant cut rule in demonstrating that the A/F ratio does not deviate more than 10% from its optimal setpoint using the KeYmaera tool.

Additionally, we discuss various techniques for deriving safe forward invariant sets, pointing out the use of barrier certificates as a method akin to Lyapunov analysis. These certificates help confirm that system trajectories from an initial state set do not enter an unsafe region. Our approach modifies an existing method that uses actual system executions to create a set of linear constraints, subsequently generating candidate barrier functions. The qualifying candidate is then validated with a Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solver capable of dealing with nonlinear real-world scenarios.

The dynamics and parameters of the system were adopted from an established model and later simplified. This model includes a basic portrayal of the engine subsystems overseeing air intake and A/F ratio computations, in addition to a computer control system charged with maintaining the A/F ratio within a 10% range of nominal conditions during an engine run at a steady speed. The control system operates in two modes: (1) a recovery mode that utilizes open-loop control for fueling for a maximum of 8ms, and (2) a standard mode that employs feedback control for A/F ratio regulation.

In recovery mode, which is activated following sensor malfunctions or when sensor data is suspected to be unreliable, the controller lacks oxygen sensor input and must rely solely on air flow measurements from the intake manifold to manage operation. The normal mode, in contrast, is the standard operating condition.

In conclusion, our case study shows how specific insights into a powertrain control system can help us define an invariant and safe set. This set is then used with the forward invariant cut rule to establish a safety property for the control system.
