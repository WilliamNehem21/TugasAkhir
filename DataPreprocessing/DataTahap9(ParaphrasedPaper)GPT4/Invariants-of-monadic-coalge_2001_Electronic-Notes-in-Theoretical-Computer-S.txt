In the paper, the authors explore how the concept of monads provides a framework for combining simpler programs into more complex ones. Traditionally, the carrier in a coalgebra is viewed as a collection of computational states. Adopting the perspective presented by E. Moggi, the authors treat the carrier as a set of data instead.

The study of invariant properties of computations has been a critical aspect of computer science for a considerable time. This paper discusses computational invariants within the context of monadic coalgebras. Building upon earlier work that defined invariants for general coalgebras as subsets of the carrier that are preserved under the coalgebraic structure, the authors introduce a new notion called invariant co-relations.

However, it is observed that invariant co-relations may not always uniquely determine a coalgebra, especially in irregular cases. To address this, the authors aim to identify specific well-behaved coalgebras, described as idempotent coalgebras, and demonstrate that all coalgebras can be reduced to one of these idempotent forms.
