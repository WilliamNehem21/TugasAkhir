The paper discusses the computation of compact sets and operators applied to them, citing previous works that have investigated the computability of these sets ([13,15,16]) and the complexity of specific examples like Julia sets ([2,12]). It points out that while compact sets themselves have been studied, the complexity of operators acting on compact sets has not been as thoroughly examined.

The focus of the last part of the paper is the computational challenge of determining the convex hull of a compact set. The paper reveals that this operation is generally of exponential complexity, and it tentatively establishes a link to the renowned P vs NP problem, specifically for compact sets that are both regular and simply connected. The proof of this connection is said to draw inspiration from a similar approach used in another study which dealt with maximizing real functions.

The paper emphasizes the importance of representation in computing complexity, particularly the notation of numbers used in definitions. It suggests that numbers should be expressed in unary notation—a string of 'n' length for the number 'n'—and the grid bound 'b' should also be returned in unary. Additionally, it specifies the format for writing oracle queries.

Regarding the complexity of the cross product operator, the paper describes a relatively straightforward process. For a given input that includes multiple dimensions (d1,..., dk+k'), the computation modifies the queries such that one oracle is called with the first segment of dimensions (d1,..., dk) and a second one with the remaining dimensions (dk+1,..., dk+k'), rather than identical queries.

Lastly, the paper remarks on the exponential complexity of the projection operator for general sets, apart from convex sets where the operation is presumably less complex. Drawing from the difficulty of projecting operators, it infers that computing the convex hull—another operation related to convexity—must also be intensive. The paper closes by acknowledging a gap in extending the complexity results of projections to connected sets, indicating an area for further research.
