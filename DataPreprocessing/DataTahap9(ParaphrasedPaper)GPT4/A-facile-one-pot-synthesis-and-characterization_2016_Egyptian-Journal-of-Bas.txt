This academic paper describes a safer, less expensive, and less toxic approach to synthesizing silver selenide (Ag2Se) nanoparticles compared to traditional methods that involve sodium selenide (Na2Se) or hydrogen selenide (H2Se). A microwave-enhanced synthesis strategy was employed, which offers benefits including controlled product properties, high yields, the ability to easily manage temperature and pressure, high purity of products, short reaction times, and environmental advantages such as safety, reproducibility, energy savings, and selective heating.

The nanoparticles were synthesized in an innovative low-temperature microemulsion environment that prevents particle aggregation and promotes the formation of uniformly sized particles. This low-temperature approach also contributes to the production of nearly monodisperse nanoparticles due to slower growth rates and reduced activity of surface atoms.

The synthesis process involves three primary steps. Initially, sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and oleic acid were dissolved in a mixture containing deionized water, ethyl alcohol (C2H5OH), and n-hexane to form a transparent microemulsion. Silver nitrate (AgNO3) was then introduced to this microemulsion, which led to a vigorous stirring phase.

After the reaction, additional n-hexane was added to break down the microemulsion, aiding in the extraction of the Oleic acid-coated Ag2Se nanoparticles into an oil phase. This mixture was then centrifuged, and the nanoparticles were further purified by multiple washes with n-hexane and ethanol to remove any remaining oleic acid. The final product was dispersed in n-hexane for storage. The formation of Ag2Se nanoparticles through this method can be summarized by a sequence of simple precipitation reactions.

The use of capping ligands, or protective surface molecules, was highlighted as a means to prevent the clumping of small crystals and to influence the shape and size of the final nanoparticles. The dynamics of these ligands attaching to and detaching from the nanoparticle surfaces can be adjusted by changing the reaction temperature and the type of ligand used, allowing for control over nanocrystal growth.
