The paper discusses how quantum measurements differ fundamentally from classical measurements. In classical mechanics, measuring a property (observable) of a system gives us a value with some error margin, but in quantum mechanics, measurement outcomes are essentially probabilistic. When you measure a quantum system, there are several potential results, each with a particular likelihood of occurring. Additionally, the measurement process irreversibly alters the quantum system's state, which is crucial for quantum information processing to understand.

The paper also emphasizes the necessity of properly comprehending quantum measurements so as not to misinterpret the nature of quantum computing, such as the incorrect assumption that it automatically leads to an exponential increase in computing power. The authors advocate for a formal and elegant description of measurement to grasp both the potential and the limits of quantum computation. While the paper centers on projective measurements, which are a basic type of quantum measurement, it acknowledges that they are not the only kind. Any quantum measurement can be simulated using a combination of unitary operations and projective measurements.
