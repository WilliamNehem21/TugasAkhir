The academic paper discusses giving justification for logical laws using a proof-theoretical approach, touching upon the works of notable scholars like Michael Dummett and Dag Prawitz for more in-depth analysis and precision. The methodology adopted in the paper deviates slightly from Dummett's description.

Within the text, the authors provide a brief argument to establish that CHR is a relevant logic under the framework proposed by Anderson and Belnap. The key strategy involves assigning unique numbers to each variable found within any proof object in a CHR proof. Subsequently, these proof objects are represented by the collection of their associated numbers.

The authors emphasize that the essence of a relevant proof is encapsulated through rigorous computation. The constructed system is both straightforward and user-friendly, supported by proof rules that are easy to apply, as illustrated by examples in the paper. Furthermore, connections between this logic and other relevant logics are delineated.

An important point to note is that because this logic is developed as a type theory, it lends itself readily to interpretations within the realm of computer science. Thus, propositions within this logic can be understood in computational terms.
