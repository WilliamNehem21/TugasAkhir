Rule-based languages like Kappa and BNGL enable elaborate models of protein interactions that can potentially generate a vast or even infinite array of unique biomolecular compounds due to the complex binding and phosphorylation possibilities of proteins. Identifying if a model can produce an infinite number of compounds is essential for modelers. Creating an infinite assortment of compounds could indicate modeling errors, such as overlooked conflicts among binding rules, and also affects model semantics.

In this academic paper, the authors explore this problem by first introducing case studies to demonstrate the pertinent properties of biomolecular compound formation and to emphasize potential modeling traps. Kappa language fundamentals are reviewed, highlighting the static analysis of graphs without delving into rules or rule applications, focusing solely on the binding topologies of proteins.

The paper discusses two distinct kinds of graph representations and a method to determine the finiteness of biomolecular compounds within a model based on contact maps. The complexities of biomolecular compound enumeration in larger combinatorial networks are acknowledged, showing that certain models can lead to an extremely large or even infinite number of compounds.

The discussion goes on to explain the preservation of agent types and binding possibilities in morphisms, the formation of chains among agents, and the implications of extending chains on the labeling of edges within graphs. A step-by-step analysis of refining the graph of links is provided, considering the composition of incoming and outgoing edges while maintaining structural invariants.

A procedure for translating the contact map into a classical graph representing the potential succession of binding sites or links within biomolecular compounds is described. This allows for detecting patterns that might repeat indefinitely within reachable compounds in the model without having to enumerate each possibility.

Lastly, the paper mentions the partial integration of these approaches into the static analyzer KASA, which now includes the graph construction of potential successive links, and how it aligns with previous static analyses. Future plans for the analyzer aim to address the precise modeling of cyclic structures that do not yield arbitrarily long biomolecular compounds.
