The referenced academic paper discusses complex concepts in category theory, particularly pseudo-monads and pseudo-algebras, as well as pseudo-distributive laws. These concepts are described as being somewhat more intricate than the corresponding notions for 2-monads and ordinary monads, yet the differences are said to be marginal, primarily involving additional coherence conditions.

Two primary examples are provided for illustration:

1. **Pseudo-Monad TFP**: The pseudo-monad TFP pertains to the category of small categories equipped with finite products (denoted as CAT). The associated 2-category of TFP-algebras (PS-TFP-ALG) consists of objects that are small categories with finite products, morphisms that are functors preserving finite products (up to coherent isomorphism), and 2-cells that are all natural transformations. Thus, PS-TFP-ALG is identical to the 2-category FP, and the category TFP(C) for a small category C is the free category on C with finite products.

2. **Pseudo-Monad TCOC for Cocomplete Categories**: There is no pseudo-monad for cocomplete categories on CAT due to size issues; any small cocomplete category is essentially a preorder, and a free large cocomplete category on a small category cannot be contained within CAT. However, there are well-established techniques to address this issue. By adopting these techniques, there is a pseudo-monad TCOC for cocomplete categories. The category TCOC(C) for any small category C is represented by the presheaf category [C^op, Set].

The paper further discusses pseudo-distributive laws, analogous to ordinary distributive laws but with some additional complexity due to coherence details. This involves specifying which two-dimensional diagrams need to correspond with one another.

An example (3.11) is provided where the signature does not seem computationally significant. However, the authors are not concerned by this because their main theorem asserts that any signature allows for initial algebra semantics. Therefore, including less interesting examples does not affect the validity of their results.

Lastly, the paper touches upon the concept of binding and notes that it is subtler than in the work of Fiore et al. By restricting to the subset of functors that preserve pullbacks, Fiore et al. could meaningfully discuss the support of a bound term, and this idea can be analyzed through the proposed axiomatization in section 3 of the paper.
