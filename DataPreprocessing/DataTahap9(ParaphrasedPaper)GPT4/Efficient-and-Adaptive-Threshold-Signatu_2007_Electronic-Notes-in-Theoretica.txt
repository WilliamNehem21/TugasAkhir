The paper discusses dynamic mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs) where nodes are free to join and leave, potentially causing rapid and significant changes in the network's composition. MANETs operate without hierarchical structure, with each node functioning autonomously, making them suitable for a variety of applications in both military and civilian contexts. They are anticipated to be integral in providing pervasive services, influencing everything from how people communicate and work to various industries like business, education, entertainment, and healthcare, contributing to the concept of ubiquitous computing available at any time.

The focus of the paper is on distributing a signature service within a MANET, which requires a mechanism for creating a key pair <sk, pk> and a system for enabling a group of individuals to sign messages with the private key (sk). The network is presumed to use an RSA key pair for this purpose. Existing solutions typically rely on threshold schemes where the private key is split into shares that are given to multiple co-signers.

However, the paper proposes a new type of secret sharing scheme that allows sk to be additively shared amongst all network members. It enables subgroups with different shares to collectively generate a signature on behalf of the entire group. This scheme is described as a (t,t)-threshold scheme in which shares are replicated and the threshold t can be adjusted to enhance the system's resilience. Members of a subgroup individually generate partial signatures, which are later combined to form a complete signature. The signature's size is not affected by the subgroup size and can be easily validated, while also including mechanisms to detect dishonest co-signers.

Protocols are outlined for nodes within the network to issue signatures and to increase the threshold value, with various standard assumptions about network function and security. Each participant has a unique identifier and can communicate with nearby nodes; network members can dynamically fail, join, or leave; and there is an assumption of secure communication channels and reliable message delivery through a routing layer.

The paper also describes a system for tracking member contributions over time using a specific method of share allocation, such as a round-robin policy. This system ensures that members' classes can be determined by the number of protocol executions over time, which allows for orderly management of the process as the MANET evolves.
