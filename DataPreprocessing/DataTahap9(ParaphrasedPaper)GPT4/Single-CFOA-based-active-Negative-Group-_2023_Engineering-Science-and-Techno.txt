In the paper, the authors introduce nine innovative single current feedback operational amplifier (CFOA)-based negative group delay (NGD) circuits designed via computer-aided methods, potentially beneficial for communication or control systems. The core NGD circuit concepts, CFOA details, a review of existing active NGD configurations, and the novel circuits are discussed in Section 2. Section 3 outlines the circuit design approach followed by an analysis of non-ideal characteristics in one chosen NGD circuit in Section 4. Section 5 provides simulation results and experimental validation of the designs. A comparative performance evaluation with select contemporary solutions is featured in Section 6. The paper concludes with a summary in Section 7.
