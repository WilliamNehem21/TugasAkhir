This paper discusses the study of partially ordered sets (posets) that extend beyond directed complete partially ordered sets (dcpos). The authors introduce new concepts including approximated elements and hyper-approximated elements within posets, and present characterizations of continuous posets and hypercontinuous posets. Additionally, they generalize the concept of approximated elements to quasi-approximated elements specifically for dcpos, offering new insights into the nature of quasicontinuous domains. The study establishes that, under certain conditions, the set of approximated or quasi-approximated elements within a dcpo can be structured as a continuous or quasicontinuous domain, respectively.

The paper builds upon foundational work by Scott, who initially introduced the concept of continuous lattices as a model for programming language semantics, and further develops the understanding of continuous dcpos/domains that are relevant to computer science. An infimum and directed sets in a poset context are also described, where a dcpo is defined as a poset in which every directed set has a supremum, and a complete lattice is described as a poset where every subset has a supremum.
