The paper discusses a specialized type of directed graph (digraph) referred to as an arc-spine digraph. In this context, a digraph 'D' qualifies as an arc-spine digraph if it can be divided into two subsets 'X' and 'Y' of its vertex set 'V(D)' such that the subdigraph induced by 'X' (denoted as D[X]) has a Hamiltonian path (a path that visits each vertex exactly once), and the subdigraph induced by 'Y' (D[Y]) contains at most one directed edge or arc. A partition {X, Y} is described as 'maximal' if 'X' cannot be extended further while maintaining the arc-spine property. The unique arc in D[Y], if it exists, has vertices 'U' (the start point, or "tail") and 'V' (the endpoint, or "head").

The paper introduces a concept analogous to one in a previous study, indicated by citation [9, Lemma 1], but adapted for k-loose arc-spine digraphs. The authors note that the definition of 'k-loose' they employ for arc-spine digraphs is distinct from the definition used for regular spine digraphs in the earlier work. This is done to ensure perfect correspondence between the lemmas from the cited study and the current context for arc-spine digraphs. The analogous version for arc-spine digraphs is explored in Lemma 2.8 of the paper.

The proof technique for Lemma 2.8, which is an adaptation of the proof from the earlier study [9, Lemma 3], is hailed as particularly clever. However, the paper underscores that the k-tight concept for spine digraphs is different when applied to arc-spine digraphs, and it indicates that proving the base case for Lemma 2.8 is more complex than it was for the corresponding case in the earlier work.
