The paper aims to expand the concept of simulation by re-defining it in a way that allows Kripke structures, which are models used in modal logic with varying sets of atomic propositions, to be compared and related. By doing so, the authors intend to unify previous classifications of Kripke structures into a single, more versatile category. To accomplish this, a new definition is necessary to facilitate the translation of properties between Kripke structures with different atomic propositions.

Section 5.1 of the paper introduces a broad-ranging concept of a map. However, this concept is limited because it only considers functions. The authors address this limitation by proposing an extension of their earlier ideas to accommodate a wider range of relationships beyond just functions.

The authors also differentiate between how they treat functions and relations within a specific context: recursive enumerable (r.e.) relations versus recursive functions. For the recursive set of functions, they limit their scope to recursive functions. In contrast, when dealing with r.e. relations, they permit any arbitrary r.e. relation. This distinction is intentional since, in general, the composition of recursive relations does not necessarily result in a relation that is recursive, which justifies the choice to allow a broader range of r.e. relations.
