This academic paper discusses the issue of weeds and the need for natural weed management solutions to decrease reliance on synthetic herbicides. The Weed Science Society of America defines a weed as any undesired plant that hinders human activity or well-being, with various species reacting differently to phytotoxic substances, as highlighted in earlier studies.

Research focused on Bidens pilosa seeds, gathered from orchards in El-Sharkia Governorate, Egypt. These seeds were disinfected, rinsed, dried, and stored prior to experimentation. The seeds' germination process took place in the dark, followed by cultivation on filter paper with varying concentrations of plant extracts to assess growth inhibition.

Plantago lagopus was found to have lower growth inhibitory effects compared to a Turkish ecotype, possibly due to environmental or genetic factors. It also had high levels of flavonoids and saponins. Meanwhile, Plantago squarrosa exhibited strong inhibitory effects on B. pilosa growth, especially the radicle (root) due to its direct exposure to allelochemicals.

The study suggests that the observed reduction in B. pilosa seedling growth could be due to disturbances in various physiological processes, such as cell division, metabolism, and enzyme activity. When comparing the effects of methanolic and aqueous extracts from Plantago species, the former was found to be more phytotoxic to germination and growth of B. pilosa due to methanol's superior ability to dissolve a wider range of active components.

In conclusion, certain Plantago species showed potential for weed control due to their phytotoxic effects. However, the study recommends further research to identify and understand these allelochemicals and their mechanisms of action for developing an eco-friendly weed management approach.
