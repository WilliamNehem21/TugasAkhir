As systems need to adapt to ever-changing environments, the study of runtime-modifiable Petri nets has gained prominence. These flexible Petri nets are relevant to fields like collaborative software, multi-agent systems, dynamic process mining, and mobile networks. This adaptability not only enhances the descriptive power of Petri nets but also provides a structured way to represent dynamic alterations.

The more intricate aspects of adhesive HLR (High-Level Replacement) systems are not addressed here; interested readers should look elsewhere for the foundational theory. Instead, this paper examines different categories of Petri nets—both simple and complex—to determine if they qualify as weak adhesive HLR categories. To fully leverage the adhesive HLR systems theory for these nets, additional attributes are needed, although they are outside the paper's scope.

Building upon previous work that established P/T (Place/Transition) systems as weak adhesive HLR categories, this paper extends those proofs to the broader domain of net markings. The paper aims to demonstrate the existence of pushouts that respect m-strict morphisms, crucial components for maintaining net structure during transformations.

The practical application of this theoretical work is exemplified by modeling a library system. In this system, users can access a reading hall with an entry card, provided they aren't carrying bags. Within the hall, they can read books if they possess a library card. To exit, users are required to return any borrowed books. This model showcases how Petri nets can manage system rules and the possible state changes within a dynamic environment.
