Proof nets were introduced by Girard in 1987 as a comprehensive representation of proofs in linear logic, where every proof can be associated with a corresponding proof net, and vice-versa. These proof nets provide a clear operational semantics through a form of graph rewriting or reduction. Specifically in the multiplicative and exponential segment of proof nets, the process of graph rewriting reduction has been proven to be strongly normalizing according to Girard's 1987 work, and confluent as shown by Lafont in 1995. This makes proof nets an effective computational system.

Definition 2.2 (Polarized Formulas): An Intuitionistic Linear Logic (IMELL) formula is a tuple that consists of a Multiplicative Exponential Linear Logic (MELL) formula, 'A', accompanied by a polarity 'P', which is either positive (+) or negative (-) following Danos-Regnier's assignment of polarity. One can express a formula with this polarity as A^P. These formulas are referred to as polarized formulas, with positive formulas indicated by a '+' and negative formulas by a '-'.

Definition 3.2 (Depth): The depth of a particular link 'l' in a proof net is defined as the number of '!' (bang boxes) that envelop 'l'. The overall depth for the proof net, noted as 'D()', corresponds to the largest depth observed among all links within the proof net. Conversely, the co-depth `Co-D(l)` is determined as the difference between 'D()' and 'D(l)'.

Section 'd' specifies that for two separate proof nets referred to as 1 and 2, if each has an equivalent sub-proof-net, designated as 01 and 02, and they share the same positively polarized conclusion formula 'C+', with identical positions in both proof nets, several conditions must be met. The main condition is that if the head formula of the main path in 01 is discharged or absorbed, then the same must be true for the corresponding head formula in 02. If both head formulas from the two-proof nets are discharged or absorbed, they must share the same discharged or absorbed point, ensuring a consistency in how formulas are manipulated within similar structures.
