This paper investigates the energy efficiency of direct current (DC) distribution systems. It develops models for calculating the efficiency of feeders and loads, and examines the efficiencies of AC/DC, DC/DC, and DC/AC conversions. The study compares the energy efficiency of an alternating current (AC) system with two DC systems, namely monopole and bipolar configurations. The findings indicate that a DC power system improves energy efficiency in an office building compared to an AC power system, with the research showing a higher energy efficiency for DC distribution overall.

Key considerations for the energy efficiency index of power feeders include active power loss, transmission efficiency, energy loss, and feeder loss rate. The paper compares the calculation models for AC feeders, monopole DC feeders, and bipolar DC feeders, with the DC feeders operating in a metal loop mode.

Assumptions made in the study include neglecting the losses of feeders within the building itself. By using the load models and daily load curves, the energy loss for a building and its main loads across a single day can be calculated, with results presented in Table 3.

The study finds that the bipolar DC feeder has the highest efficiency compared to the AC feeder and monopole DC feeder based on the calculations. When an office building is powered by DC rather than AC, its efficiency is significantly higher, with an approximate increase of 14.90%. This research provides a theoretical basis for the potential replacement of AC supply systems with DC supply systems in office buildings.

The paper refers to a conference proceeding by Starke et al. titled "AC vs. DC Distribution: Maximum Transfer Capability," which was presented at the IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting in July 2008 in Pittsburgh, PA, USA.
