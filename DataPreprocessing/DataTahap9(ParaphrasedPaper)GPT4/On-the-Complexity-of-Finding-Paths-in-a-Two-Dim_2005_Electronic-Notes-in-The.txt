In the academic paper, it is noted that the domain 'S' produced in Theorem 4.3 meets certain criteria of property (b) but does not exhibit simple connectivity; it actually encompasses a limitless number of gaps. The possibility of modifying this structure to either render 'S' simply connected, or to transform it into a domain with a limited number of gaps (therefore multiply connected), remains an open area for further exploration. It is confirmed that the findings of Theorem 4.1 are also applicable to the problem of k-path when k is greater than 1. Consequently, for simply connected domains 'S' that adhere to property (a) or property (b), there exists a more modest lower bound established.
