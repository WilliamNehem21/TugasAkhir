The academic paper discusses the limitations of Basic Message Sequence Charts (BMSCs) and introduces High-level Message Sequence Charts (HMSCs) as a more powerful tool for defining complex behaviors in distributed systems. BMSCs are insufficient because they can only represent finite behaviors with limited alternatives, whereas HMSCs, which can be thought of as transition systems labeled by BMSCs, provide a more expressive framework that includes higher-level constructs.

HMSCs interpret choices such that the first instance to encounter a choice point dictates the behavior to be followed by subsequent instances that reach the same point. This implies an implicit agreement or communication among instances.

Local choice properties in HMSCs can be verified by examining only maximal acyclic paths and are, therefore, decidable for finite HMSCs. The paper shows that a consensus algorithm can be applied to ensure that non-local HMSC choices become local.

The authors propose using a partially synchronized product of HMSCs, motivated by Arnoldâ€™s method for synchronizing labeled transition systems. This involves combining transitions from the base automata partially, and then computing amalgamated sums of BMSCs to create new BMSCs.

The paper focuses on the implementation challenges with non-local choices in HMSCs and suggests automatically integrating a consensus protocol into such HMSCs using a fibered product. This results in a transformed HMSC suitable for an arbitrary number of instances involved in a non-local choice.

Two main issues are addressed: designing an election protocol that scales with the number of instances without manual intervention and inserting these consensus protocols directly after the choice nodes. These problems are solved by automating BMSC combinations and calculating the fibered product of HMSCs.

Additionally, the authors implement a supervisor to enforce local choices using a first-arrived, first-served policy. This supervisor protocol ensures coordinated decisions among participating instances.

The paper provides a formal definition of merging BMSCs and HMSCs based on synchronous product and amalgamated sum. This approach facilitates inductive composition for multiple instances and defines a notion of coherence, where the resulting HMSC can be checked for well-formation to verify the consistency of the merged views.

Finally, the paper suggests utilizing libraries of formally defined patterns for easy reuse and instantiation to create complex scenarios involving numerous instances. These scenarios could be valuable for deployment, testing, and simulation.
