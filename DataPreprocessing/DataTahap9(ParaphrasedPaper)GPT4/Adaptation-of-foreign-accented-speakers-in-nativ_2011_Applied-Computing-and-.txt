This paper explores improving Arabic speech recognition (ASR) systems for non-native speakers with heavy accents by employing adaptation techniques, specifically Maximum Likelihood Linear Regression (MLLR), Maximum a Posteriori (MAP), and a hybrid of both MLLR and MAP. Leveraging the LDC-WestPoint Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) corpus and HTK toolkit, the study performs various experiments and evaluates systems with word and phoneme-level recognition accuracy. The results indicate that unique MSA phonemes, such as pharyngeal and emphatic consonants, are better recognized after adapting with these techniques, achieving a notable 7.37% improvement in overall accuracy. This suggests that adaptation methods can effectively mitigate difficulties in pronouncing non-native language phonemes. 

The paper also reviews the influence of a speaker's native language on their second language pronunciation and how it affects ASR system performance. Previous research, such as that by Bartkova and Jouvet, supports the effectiveness of model adaptation to reduce errors in ASR for non-native speakers. The current research focusing on Arabic faces challenges due to limited studies and complexity of MSA's phonemic system, involving fewer vowels and unique consonant articulations compared to languages like English. 

Experimental setup includes adapting native speaker-trained recognition systems for non-native usage, involving 12 adapted systems with three adaptation techniques and evaluations on both word and phoneme levels. Arabic ASR struggles with a scarcity of short vowel indicators and complex morphologies, increasing the difficulty of language modeling and pronunciation predictability. 

The study concludes with the intention to further investigate evolutionary-based techniques and auto-adaptation capabilities to better accommodate a wider range of foreign accents, improve the quality of speech corpora, and explore the impact of other native languages on Arabic ASR performance, with potential applications to English ASR systems for Arabic speakers.
