The academic paper presents a comprehensive framework for pervasive verification of complex systems. This work includes a method to establish trust in the initial binary compiler for C0, a C-like programming language used in the Verisoft project. Compiler verification is an established academic field, with prior work examining various aspects of compiler correctness across different languages and optimizations. However, this paper is unique in integrating multiple previously independent solutions to prove the correctness of compiled C0 programs on an actual system.

Previous projects, such as Verifix and CLI, have made significant strides in compiler verification. The Verifix project laid foundations in the translation theory from intermediate to machine languages, while the CLI project verified various software components. Shao's work in assembler-level verification is also notable. However, pervasive verification of compiler correctness raises additional challenges, such as combining individual proofs into a single coherent framework, as discussed by Joyce in relation to hardware verification.

In this paper, C0 is chosen for its balance between features and simplicity, facilitating efficient program verification. C0 supports dynamic memory allocation with a garbage collector and function calls that produce side-effect-free expressions. Advanced constructs like generalized variables (g-variables) aid in addressing memory in small-step semantics, a form of operational semantics for program execution.

The paper's structure outlines the C0 language, its semantics, and the corresponding compiler verification process, including a simulated compiler specification and comprehensive correctness proofs. The bootstrap problem, ensuring the trust in the initial compiler binary, is also addressed.

Although verification efforts cover a significant portion of C0, including memory management and function execution, certain areas like parsing and I/O operations remain unverified. The compiler's core, verified for correctness, is supplemented by an unverified front-end and back-end for parsing and output.

The verification involves a single-pass compiling specification and a contrasting two-pass compiler implementation, with challenges arising from the differences between imperative and functional programming paradigms. The paper details challenges and solutions for recursive functions and data structure traversal, which impact the proof process.

Overall, the paper demonstrates an exhaustive proof effort, with the compiler implementation's total correctness verified in about 1,500 lines of C0 and supported by approximately 85,000 lines of Isabelle proof code. This work paves the way for future verification endeavors, potentially resolving the gap between software and hardware verification.
