We present a method for analyzing and verifying components in Timed CSP-OZ, a specification language that combines elements of CSP (Communicating Sequential Processes) and Object-Z with timing constraints. This language extends traditional CSP-OZ by introducing time features through clock variables. We define a formal concept of implementation—akin to refinement—that allows for substitutability checks between different component specifications.

Our approach is based on assigning semantics to Timed CSP-OZ specifications using timed automata (or timed transition systems for more complex cases), which model the behavior of systems over time. For specifications with a finite state space, we can apply model checkers like KRONOS or UPPAAL for verification purposes.

To formalize implementation in Timed CSP-OZ, we utilize the concept from timed automata where implementation is based on language inclusion, meaning that all timed traces of the implementation are contained in the specification. We propose timed simulation conditions and demonstrate their soundness in reflecting this inclusion relationship, enabling stepwise proofs of implementation.

The academic paper is structured to first illustrate these ideas using an example of a Timed CSP-OZ specification. We introduce the concept of timed automata and describe how to express Timed CSP-OZ semantics in such terms. Then we explain how interface specifications can be analyzed using the UPPAAL model checker and outline timed simulation conditions for proving implementations.

We provide a detailed example featuring a watchdog component that must execute a specific method within a 10-time-unit window and can signal an alarm through different methods after specified time conditions are met. This component is modeled using an Object-Z class.

Furthermore, we show how to map Timed CSP-OZ specifications onto timed automata, given necessary restrictions on clock-related predicate expressions, to ensure decidability for verification. We demarcate the clockless parts of a specification from the clock-dependent parts and discuss how a specification generates a specific class of timed automata.

The semantics enable the analysis of interface specifications, and assuming a finite number of locations in the automaton, we can utilize model-checking tools for verification. The paper suggests that checking language inclusion for Timed CSP-OZ is undecidable in general; however, it proposes a compositional check technique that combines the CSP and Object-Z segments separately.

For practical applications, we need to integrate Timed CSP-OZ simulation conditions with corresponding CSP model-checking tools. The overall aim is to facilitate high-level component specification that surpasses timed automata in modeling capabilities, offering substantial new possibilities in modeling components with timing requirements. Future work will consider expanding on the treatment of parallel composition, nondeterminism, and integrating the failures-divergences model of CSP.
