The paper discusses the introduction of a novel approach to process hitting (PH), a method in systems biology for modeling biological systems, by incorporating a priority scheduling of actions. Previously, the concept of priority in biological model frameworks, like Petri nets, was not thoroughly examined, with only a few attempts made by researchers such as F. Bause and A.K. Wagler et al. Process algebras had more success in incorporating priority, as demonstrated by R. Cleaveland.

This research extends the semantics of PH by segmenting actions into different priority classes, facilitating more accurate representations of cooperative components. The authors propose an effective method for under-approximating component states' reachability, which is suitable for static analysis and can be expanded to analyze global state reachability. Through this method, the paper asserts that the new subclass of models studied is bisimilar to asynchronous discrete networks, enabling efficient state reachability computation and behavioral analysis of these models.

The paper also outlines how the incorporation of priorities into PH allows for the encoding of any Boolean function between processes without temporal shifts, matching the expressivity of Boolean networks. The goal of the study is to improve static analysis of system dynamics.

To showcase the practicality and scalability of the reachability under-approximation, the authors apply their method to a large-scale T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling pathway model composed of 94 components, specified as a Boolean network, and implemented in the Pint software tool.

The TCR model is encoded into PH with two classes of priority, and the reachability of four outputs is tested across various input combinations, yielding conclusive results through under-approximation ("yes" or "inconclusive") and over-approximation ("no" or "inconclusive"). In 12 out of 32 cases, the under-approximation confirmed the reachability property. The performance was efficient, with computation times in the order of hundredths of a second on a system with moderate processing power.

The authors compared their method to the libddd symbolic model checker, using the same TCR model coded as a Petri net, but found that libddd couldn't handle the large-scale model due to memory limitations. This comparison demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of the authors' approach for large-scale biological models.
