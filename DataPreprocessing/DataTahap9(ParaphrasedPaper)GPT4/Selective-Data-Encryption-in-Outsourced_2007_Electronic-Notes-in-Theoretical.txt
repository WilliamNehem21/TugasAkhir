In this article, the authors suggest a novel approach for enforcing access control for databases managed by third parties, combining cryptography with authorization processes. They propose selective encryption, where access rights are managed via different encryption keys, ensuring that only authorized users can decrypt and access specific pieces of data.

Despite significant study of outsourced database scenarios, traditional access control mechanisms, typically designed for client-server architectures, have not addressed the unique requirements of these environments. In these conventional systems, the server, which is assumed to be trusted, manages and enforces access control. However, in scenarios where the server is a third party and unaware of the data owner's access policies, such an assumption is invalid.

Previous methods assumed clients had full access to unencrypted query results, utilizing a single encryption key for the entire database. This forces data owners to manually filter unauthorized data from query results, a process that is inefficient and impractical.

The authors argue for a selective encryption method, where different data pieces are encrypted using various keys. Users must decrypt data with appropriate keys that correspond to their access rights, thus creating a scenario where different users have differential access based on the keys they possess.

The paper is divided into sections that explain the concepts of access control and selective encryption, propose an efficient algorithm to enforce access control, illustrate how policy changes are managed, and then draw conclusions.

Key components of the approach include an access matrix representing the enforcement policies and a tree hierarchy (TUH) representing the mapping of encrypted data to access control lists (ACLs). When data is inserted into the database, it is encrypted with the key associated with its ACL. If policies change or data is deleted, the TUH must be updated, though the authors acknowledge that updates yield a less optimal structure than a full rebuild of the hierarchy.

The paper also discusses the computational complexity of managing selective encryption and TUH, comparing it to the complexity of solving the well-known 3-SAT problem, indicating that efficiently solving the minimum TUH problem is at least as challenging as 3-SAT.

Overall, the paper presents a cryptographic approach to access control for third-party managed databases, with the objective of achieving more efficient and secure selective access for different users.
