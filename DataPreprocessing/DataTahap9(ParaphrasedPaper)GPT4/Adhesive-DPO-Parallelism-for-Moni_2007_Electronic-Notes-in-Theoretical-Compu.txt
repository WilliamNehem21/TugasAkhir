Process calculi are established tools for modeling interactive systems. They differentiate between closed systems, characterized by a reduction system (RS), and open systems, understood through a labeled transition system (LTS). The double pushout (DPO) approach also models these systems, with reductions equating to DPO rewrites and interactions seen as transitions within a borrowed context from the environment. The DPO uniquely separates concurrent events from interleaved ones in closed systems. This paper seeks to extend this advantage to open systems by enhancing LTS labels to reflect concurrent environmental interactions.

This research focuses on creating bisimulation congruences that acknowledge concurrency. It introduces initial methods by enriching a set of production rules with parallel productions, then using the borrowed context method to foster bisimulation congruences cognizant of concurrency. A key concept is to shift from coproducts, connecting to an empty graph, to pushouts, which are more adaptable in adhesive categories. The transition from coproducts to pushouts, and its implications, will be detailed further in the paper.
