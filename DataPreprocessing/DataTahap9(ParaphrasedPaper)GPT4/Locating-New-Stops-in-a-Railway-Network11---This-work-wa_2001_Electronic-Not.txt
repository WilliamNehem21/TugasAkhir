This academic paper discusses the implications of adding new stops to an existing railway network, focusing on two primary effects: improved access to the network for the population and changes in travel time for current passengers.

The paper outlines a study on how new stops can make the railway network more accessible, considering the possibility that closer proximity to a stop could encourage more people to use trains. The authors define an optimization problem related to this accessibility concept and show that it is NP-complete, meaning it is computationally difficult to find an optimal solution.

Regarding travel time, the paper addresses the contrasting effects of introducing new stops: while some passengers will experience longer journeys due to additional stops, others will benefit from reduced travel times to the nearest stop. The authors propose a measure for the collective change in travel time for existing customers and establish that the optimization problem for minimizing overall travel time is also NP-complete.

The authors suggest a genetic algorithm as a solution method for the travel time optimization problem and present preliminary experimental results using the entire railway network of Deutsche Bahn AG in Germany.

The paper provides technical details on how a feasible solution for the new stops is defined within the railway network's structure, which is described as a series of linear segments. Notably, for simple single-segment scenarios, the problem can be solved in polynomial time using linear programming.

The travel time model is conceptualized as a location problem where new stops must be situated on a fixed network. The authors note that since traditional location models do not fit this scenario perfectly due to the non-convex nature of the objective function and other complexities, new algorithms need to be created, with a genetic algorithm being their initial proposed solution.
