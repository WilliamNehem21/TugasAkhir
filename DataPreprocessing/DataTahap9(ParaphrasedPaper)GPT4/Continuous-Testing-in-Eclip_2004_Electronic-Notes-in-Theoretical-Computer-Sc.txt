Java developers utilizing Eclipse have the advantage of continuous compilation, which means the IDE compiles code incrementally with every saved change, keeping class files updated and rapidly alerting developers of any compilation errors. Despite occasional unnecessary feedback, its widespread use and effectiveness affirm its value and practicality given today's fast processors.

The authors created an initial continuous testing system for Emacs, which after testing with students, led to a more advanced version for Eclipse. Their Eclipse plugin leverages existing infrastructure for unit testing and error notification, making it easier to implement and adopt. Using this plugin, developers can link a test suite to their Java project, and tests automatically run after any code change. Test failures are reported similarly to compilation errors. A test prioritization feature is also included to speed up failure detection. This plugin aims to coexist with manual JUnit use and minimizes intrusiveness.

The paper is structured to first review relevant literature on continuous testing. It then details the user interface and technical design of the plugin, followed by suggested improvements for both the plugin and Eclipse's frameworks. A study demonstrated the plugin's positive impact on student developersâ€™ speed and code quality, with most participants planning continued use and recommending it to others.

Continuous testing in Eclipse provides quick feedback on test failures, similar to how Eclipse indicates compilation errors. Unlike compile errors, test failures may not map to a single code line and can offer more detail like backtraces.

The paper overviews Eclipse's relevant design aspects that shaped their plugin, emphasizing the static and dynamic elements of auto-building and JUnit launching frameworks.

Eclipse projects are seen as simple sources file containers with linked builders (like Java or RMI builders) that maintain consistency in project state.

Eclipse's extensibility for both components and user metaphors positions it well for testing new software engineering tools. The authors plan to work closely with Eclipse developers to improve integration and to expand their user base, believing continuous testing can enhance developer efficiency and confidence.
