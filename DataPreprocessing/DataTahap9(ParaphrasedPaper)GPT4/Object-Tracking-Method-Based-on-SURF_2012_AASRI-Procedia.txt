ta, d.-n. et al. have developed a method based on SURF (Speeded-Up Robust Features) to efficiently track objects in videos. This method leverages SURF descriptors to enhance the performance of interest point similarity searches. Their findings indicate that extracting SURF features demands less computational effort and is faster than utilizing SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform).

The structure of the paper is outlined as follows. Section 2 discusses the SURF feature matching algorithm. Section 3 explains the hardware setup of the tracking system. Sectional 4 details experimental results, and Section 5 wraps up the paper with a conclusion.

The SURF algorithm encompasses three main operations: detecting interest points, describing these points, and matching them. Detection is facilitated by a Hessian matrix-based detector, proving to be more stable and repeatable than previous methods like those using Harris detectors. The description phase employs Haar wavelets to cut down on computations and strengthen robustness. To approximate second-order Gaussian filtering, block filtering is used, and integral images serve to quicken convolution, thereby reducing computational complexity and boosting speed.

In the SURF framework, interest points are identified across various scales. This is crucial since the matching process often compares points across different scales within images. Typically, scale spaces are constructed as an image pyramid. In SURF, block filters are utilized to approximate the Gaussian kernel, with the significant advantage that their computational expense does not scale with size, which is essential for maintaining high speeds.
