The paper states that the theorem of compactness is recognized as the Alaoglu-Bourbaki theorem, which can be found in existing literature such as the cited reference [6, theorem 8.5.2]. The additional claims in section (i) are derived from established duality theory principles, referenced again in [6, chapter 8.5]. Sections (ii) and (iii) discuss concepts that are widely accepted and commonly known within the field of locally convex spaces.
