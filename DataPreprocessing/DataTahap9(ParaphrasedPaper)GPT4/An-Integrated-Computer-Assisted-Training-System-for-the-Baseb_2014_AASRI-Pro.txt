The academic paper presents a method for designing a fielding zone map that corresponds in size to the background image of a baseball field. This map uses distinct colors to indicate each fielder’s assigned zone to catch the ball, eliminating any confusion between fielders.

The method takes into account four key parameters for simulating a play in baseball: (a) ball hit status – the type of hit (fly ball, line drive, or ground ball), (b) the runners on base – with eight possible scenarios ranging from bases empty to bases loaded, (c) the number of outs in the inning, which can be 0 to 2, and (d) the result of the at-bat – whether it's a single, double, triple, fly out, or bunt. The user must also designate where the ball lands on the field. To streamline the process, the method provides 18 typical training examples.

Recognizing baseball's complexity and diverse scenarios, the proposed decision-making process focuses on the most common situations to ensure error-free plays by the fielders. The decision-making for each player is based on where the ball lands and its trajectory. For instance, the paper describes a scenario with a single hit to left field and no one on base; it outlines the movements of the left fielder, shortstop, and center fielder in this situation.

Once the players have taken their positions, the method proposes analyzing the play at successive time intervals using the critical time point method, allowing for evaluations and adjustments based on national team standards. At each critical time point, decisions need to be made regarding which fielder will catch the ball, the subsequent throw, and actions of other players. This method integrates standard paradigms into an internal system structure.

The method acknowledges the need for multiple cutoff men when the situation is complicated by extra runners. The ideal position for a cutoff man is often the midpoint between the catcher and the fielder who is throwing the ball.

Furthermore, the strategy cases created through this method can be stored as digital files, allowing them to be perpetually saved, reviewed, shared, and edited easily. The hierarchical design approach of this animation platform makes it applicable to many other sports, not just baseball, by improving communication efficiency among players and coaches.
