Artificial Intelligence (AI) significantly aids agriculture, boosting a country's GDP, particularly through this sector. Agriculture faces challenges like climate change, labor shortages, unpredictable rainy seasons, natural disasters, and leaf diseases. Advances in edge intelligence applied to agriculture, specifically plant leaf recognition and detection, are overcoming these hurdles with various deep learning models. One such innovation is the YOLOv3 neural network model, which is implemented on an embedded system using the NVIDIA Jetson TX2 and deployed on drones. The system captures plant images, identifies pest locations, and applies pesticides as neededâ€”demonstrating a cutting-edge deep learning application.

A key problem in agriculture is the massive crop loss due to the failure to predict diseases early, leading to reduced production. Early identification and analysis of crop diseases are essential to ensure crop quality. Improved computing power and large datasets enhance system efficiency.

The COVNET algorithm is an effective, modern tool for weed detection in crops. Bounding boxes are drawn on images to train the model, employing color-based segmentation and genetic algorithms alongside Bayesian categorization. A hybrid deep learning model, combining deep residual and dense networks, strikes a balance between fewer training parameters and high accuracy, reaching up to 95%.

To detect corn dietary diseases, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) boasts an accuracy of 88.46%, enhanced by hardware like the Raspberry Pi3 combined with an Intel Movidius Neural Compute Stick and system GPU pre-training.

Computer vision (CV) has advanced with AI and deep learning, especially in diagnosing grape leaf diseases. Techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and backpropagation, alongside VGGNet and ImageNet pre-trained datasets, lead to accuracies of 94.29%. Data augmentation methods like image flipping, cropping, rotation, and others expand training data for deep learning models. The Faster DR-IACNN approach excels in grape leaf disease detection with its speed and accuracy and uses a dataset expanded through augmentation techniques.

Convolutional layers in CNNs extract image features, while pooling layers, like max pooling and average pooling, reduce feature dimension to conserve computational resources. Dropout layers add regularization and prevent overfitting.

Accuracy of models is measured alongside precision, recall, and F1-score, with overall performance influenced by hyperparameter tuning. The Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) offers a nuanced measure for categorizations, ranging from -1 (poorest) to 1 (perfect), over accuracy alone.

The model is calibrated through hyperparameter adjustments related to epochs, layers, nodes, activation functions, dropout, learning rates, and batch size, aiming to optimize accuracy and minimize loss.

Experimental analyses were conducted on Google Colaboratory, which supports Python and provides GPU-powered compute resources. The Mean Average Precision (mAP) is a key metric for image processing and detection evaluation.

Final layer predictions are made with softmax activation, and hyperparameters like learning rate and epoch size are crucial during the training phase. The average accuracy achieved for grapes and tomatoes was 98.40% and 95.71%, respectively, influenced by varying learning rates and the validation process involving numerous images from diverse datasets.

Validation and testing involve comparing model outputs against actual categories to determine model effectiveness both within the modeled environment and with new, external images.
