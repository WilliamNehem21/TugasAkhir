The research paper describes a study on the protective effects of Avicenna marina extract (AM) against stomach damage caused by the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), specifically indomethacin, in rats. The study involved orally administering the extract to rats before they received indomethacin. The extract appeared to preserve certain protective biochemical markers in the rats' gastric mucosa that are typically reduced by indomethacin, suggesting the extract's potential to prevent NSAID-induced stomach injury.

Prior to the experiment, the rats were fasted for 36 hours but allowed water. They were then divided into four groups: a control group with no treatment; a group receiving just the AM extract; a group receiving just indomethacin; and a group receiving both AM extract and indomethacin. Six hours after NSAID administration, the rats were euthanized, and their stomachs were examined histopathologically.

Findings from the study indicated that indomethacin caused a reduction in protective prostaglandin (PGE2) levels and altered the pH gradient in the stomach, along with other harmful effects. Pretreatment with AM extract helped maintain PGE2 levels and other parameters closer to normal. The gastroprotective effects of AM extract may be due to its polyphenolic compounds, which previous phytochemical screening has shown to include phenolic-flavonoids, alkaloids, terpenoids, steroids, cardiac glycosides, tannins, flavonoids, and saponins. These compounds, especially tannins, may provide a protective barrier on the ulcer site and protect the stomach lining.

In summary, the AM extract demonstrated potential anti-ulcer properties and may serve as a preventive measure against NSAID-induced gastric mucosal damage through its antioxidant and protective effects.
