The concrete behavior of a program involves potentially endless processes, making it hard to answer complex questions about it practically. To circumvent this, abstract interpretation is adopted as a technique to simplify these processes to analyze fundamental characteristics within a computer's limited capabilities. This approach has been effectively utilized in fields such as program verification, error detection, and debugging.

The academic paper is structured as follows:

- Section 2: Introduces how elements within the abstract domain are represented and defines the operations of 'join' and 'meet,' constructing a lattice framework through these operations.
- Section 3: Describes an algorithm to verify the satisfiability of domain elements and to derive their normal forms.
- Section 4: Introduces a 'widening' operator to assist in abstract interpretation.
- Section 5: Discusses the transfer function that applies to the domain.
- Section 6: Summarizes the findings and conclusions of the study.
