Our research investigates the critical issue of food security in Egypt, focusing on the significant gap between the country's milk production and consumption, which results in high import costs. Academic literature commonly evaluates short-term policies to aid decision-makers, but we aim to introduce an intelligent recommender system (IRS) designed to provide more reliable estimates for the assessment of long-term policies. This system is meant to decrease future uncertainties and to encourage experts to predict the impact of potential policies, resulting in a more informed and effective decision-making process. Our IRS incorporates techniques like trend impact analysis, real-time Delphi, knowledge-based models, explanations, and mathematical forecasting to support large-scale participatory decision-making for strategic long-term planning.

The Delphi method, particularly the real-time version (RT-Delphi), is a structured tool for collective knowledge acquisition, which anonymizes responses and drives consensus among domain experts. Moreover, establishing a domain ontology is crucial for minimizing misunderstandings and ensuring a clear, common language among experts.

Our paper details the creation of an IRS to generate reliable evaluations for long-term policy suggestions. This system is intended to help Egyptian Ministry of Agriculture officials in devising and assessing long-term strategies, particularly for the national livestock production's strategic plan from 2014 to 2035. The study takes into account how various events like world financial crises, disease outbreaks, adverse weather conditions, and fluctuations in animal feed prices could affect the milk production gap.

The consensus-building process revealed several factors influencing the policy-making environment, including political, economic, socio-cultural, technological, ethical, environmental, and legal drivers, as well as strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats, each rated by domain specialists.

The IRS, based on an integration of scenario-based and knowledge-based modeling capabilities, demonstrated its value in a case study evaluating external factors on Egypt's milk production gap. The paper concludes by suggesting future improvements to the IRS, such as incorporating interval-based or fuzzy-based trend impact analysis and employing data-mining for automated ontology construction to further enhance decision-making efficacy.
