The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 reviews concepts related to typed graphs with interfaces, while Section 3 does the same for DGs-monoidal categories and their relation to discrete interface graphs. Section 4 discusses insights on discrete and disconnected graphs, and Section 5 explores initial findings on rewriting with disconnected DPOs. The concluding Section 6 summarizes the paper and refers to additional literature.

In the paper, nodes are labeled according to their sort, with dotted circles indicating input interface nodes and solid circles for output interface nodes. This may not cover all cases, but suffices for the given example. Edges are illustrated as boxes with an incoming 'tentacle' from the source and an outgoing one to the target.

Graph F1 has four nodes and four edges; X is an input node, and Z is an output node. Edges labeled 'F' lead to node labeled Z and originate from two different 'Y'-labeled nodes.

It is observed that D(P) can generate more direct derivations than P. Constraining the former through specific matching (e.g., using the natural pushout complement) can establish a one-to-one correspondence between them. For more on this topic, readers are referred to another section in the cited literature.

Disconnected graphs and their rewriting have been discussed in previous works, and this paper can be seen as an extension and generalization of those concepts to hypergraphs. Insights from earlier research are reiterated and expanded upon, though details on graph rewriting, which preserve concurrency aspects via the DPO method, are addressed particularly in Section 5, and other discussions are left for the reader to explore in the referenced works.
