This academic work is focused on analyzing how probability and possibility assessments can be logically combined and evaluated over the same set of events. The central question it addresses is how to determine whether such combined assessments, termed "mixed assessments," are logically consistent or coherent. 

The researchers define two key concepts: internal coherence and external coherence. A mixed assessment is considered coherent if it meets both of these criteria. Internal coherence means each assessment is logically consistent on its own, while external coherence requires that the assessments adhere to the principle that if an event is probable, it must also be possible.

Looking ahead, the authors plan to expand their findings to include conditional probability and possibility measures. They intend to develop a logical framework for these conditional measures and aim to achieve a coherence theorem analogous to one they have already established. However, they report a challenge in proving that the test for coherence of mixed assessments remains NP-complete when extending their work to conditional assessments. This is despite knowing that the coherence tests for both conditional probability and conditional possibility individually are NP-complete. Achieving a comprehensive characterization for external coherence in this extended context remains a complex issue.
