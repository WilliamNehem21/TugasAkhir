The paper presents an examination of the concept of client reputations within the context of internet security, particularly focusing on the consistency of host behaviors over time and how past malicious acts suggest future risks. It explains that a small group of prolific scanners is responsible for the majority of scanning activity and that blacklisting these entities could significantly reduce scan traffic. Traditional approaches to reputation, based on individual server observations, are contrasted with a collective approach, which is deemed more effective in the long term.

The authors argue for the importance of building collective memories of client behavior, with a shared system of reputation, which is a key advantage over isolated individual server-based lists.

This work represents the first systematic exploration of the distinction between client and provider reputations, and it acknowledges the unique challenges and threats that client reputation systems must contend with.

The paper also considers two models for gathering client behavior information for building reputations: the "reporter model" where servers report on their interactions with clients and the "monitor model" where independent entities observe traffic patterns. It is posited that a combination of these two models can mitigate significant threats to reputation accuracy.

Additionally, the paper sets forth specific definitions for classifying clients based on recent malicious activities (such as scanning, DDoS attacks, or spreading worms) and how reputations should be utilized, especially during incidents and under normal conditions.

It underscores that false positives in client reputations can carry a high cost for service providers, potentially leading to a loss of business and emphasizes the need for accurate report generation and verification to maintain system integrity.

The paper also discusses countermeasures for potential attacks against the reputation system, such as report fabrication and spoofed traffic, and suggests methods to handle suspicious behavior and traffic anomalies.

Lastly, the authors propose a reputation aggregation method, outline the system's components, and emphasize the need for comprehensive security measures against report fabrication, such as cryptographic protections. They acknowledge that further work is needed, but believe their proposed reporter-monitor model is a promising starting point for developing a practical, secure, and effective client reputation system that could help decrease unwanted internet traffic.
