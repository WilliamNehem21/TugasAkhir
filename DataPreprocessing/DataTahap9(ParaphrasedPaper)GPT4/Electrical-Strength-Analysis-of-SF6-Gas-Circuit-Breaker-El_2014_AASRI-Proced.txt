This paper tackles the issues associated with evaluating the electric field and investigating surface flashover phenomena in the nodal tanks of SF6 circuit breakers. It specifically looks into the electric field across the spacing between the grounded tank, a filtration system, and a conductively energized system. Moreover, the paper suggests modifications to the design of SF6 circuit breakers.

There are two primary insulation system designs for SF6 circuit breakersâ€”ones that use a gas gap and those that utilize the surfaces of solid dielectrics. The way in which electrical discharge occurs across solid dielectric surfaces is substantially different from how it happens in gas gaps, a difference that is crucial when determining the physical dimensions of the circuit breaker. In practice, the insulation system must be capable of withstanding standard AC voltages as well as elevated voltages deriving from overloads.

Results presented in the study demonstrate that the current design for dielectric strength is inadequate, even when considering a gas gap without contamination from particles and decomposition byproducts in SF6. The gas gap's dielectric strength is just slightly above the threshold for testing voltage withstand. When considering discharge across a solid dielectric's surface, the voltage is only 77% of the test withstand voltage. The paper presents a potential discharge path marked by electric field lines in the examined gap. However, it's noted that discharges along the dielectric's surface could follow a different trajectory.

The paper calculates the dielectric strength of the tank circuit breaker's insulation system based on the criterion for streamer inception, revealing that the design's dielectric strength is inadequate. The theoretical findings are backed up by experimental data from lightning impulse testing of the breaker's insulation. It's shown that by adjusting the gap within a range of 82 mm to 100 mm, the dielectric strength can be enhanced.
