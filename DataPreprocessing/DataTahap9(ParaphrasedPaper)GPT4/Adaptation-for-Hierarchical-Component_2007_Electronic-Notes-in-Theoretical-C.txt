This academic paper discusses the challenges and strategies for coordinating and adapting modular software entities, such as components or services, which may vary in complexity, design models, and granularity. The paper promotes the need for rich interface descriptions that enhance interoperability through service hierarchization, flexible declarations, and precise specifications.

To tackle these challenges, the authors introduce a Hierarchical Behavioral Interface Description Language (HBIDL), which supports structuring services, encapsulating them, and simplifying the usage of component interfaces. Additionally, the paper explores how this language can facilitate software adaptation by addressing issues arising from service hierarchy and mismatches between interface requirements.

The authors describe the traditional Behavioral Interface Description Language (BIDL) approach wherein an interface dictates the order of service invocations and dynamic behaviors through protocols. A protocol could relate to various elements, including components, interfaces, or connectors, and is defined as a state transition system, a regular expression, or a non-regular process type.

One highlighted advantage of using an HBIDL is the ability to incrementally expose documentation to clients based on a service's accessibility level. This step-wise revelation lets clients discover only what they need progressively.

The authors also discuss the practical implementation of their ideas through the COSTO prototype, which uses verification algorithms to check component and service compatibility at multiple levels. COSTO can match names of different elements, generate adaptors, and ensure compatibility by exporting models to other formal verification tools.

The paper also addresses issues with parameter and message mismatches, which can occur when client and provider use different types or granularities in their service invocations. COSTO's algorithms are designed to detect such mismatches and generate adaptations where needed.

Finally, the authors conclude by emphasizing that using HBIDL structuring mechanisms can alleviate adaptation problems, simplify service and adaptor design, and enhance the verification process compared to traditional BIDL approaches.
