Biomass energy plays a significant role in the global renewable energy sector, accounting for nearly two-thirds of current energy production [Rogner et al., 2000]. However, tar in the gas produced from biomass is problematic for internal combustion engine use [Parikh et al., 1995]. Efforts have been made to minimize engine wear resulting from tar content [Kuapp et al., 1984]. Acceptable levels of tar and particulates in gas for engine applications are believed to be less than 100 mg/Nm³ and 50 mg/Nm³ respectively [Bhattacharya S.C. et al., 1999].

Despite existing research, the design and creation of an effective compact bio-filter system that operates without preheating have yet to be fully explored. Additionally, achieving efficiency rates over 90% poses a challenge. This study introduces a newly developed compact bio-filter system with enhanced efficiency.

The system uses three distinct layers of bio-materials: a wet scrubber, wet charcoal, and dry coconut coir, each with varying dimensions. Initially, raw gas is gathered and cooled by counter flowing water that removes most dust and some tar. Next, the gas expands and slows down, which allows more tar to settle in the second filter bed. The final section condenses gas moisture and eliminates remaining tar.
