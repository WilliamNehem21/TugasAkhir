Subjects and Methods: The research involved 50 individuals, including 30 individuals with alopecia areata (AA) and 20 healthy controls. Detailed medical histories and examinations were conducted on all patients to determine the pattern and severity of AA using the SALT score. Blood samples from all participants were analyzed for a complete blood count, as well as serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], parathyroid hormone, random blood sugar, and calcium.

Results: AA patients displayed significantly lower levels of serum 25(OH)D compared to the control group. Serum 25(OH)D levels also showed a greater decrease in male patients than in female patients. Serum calcium levels in the patient group were significantly lower than those in the control group. The only notable difference in the complete blood count was a significantly lower red blood cell count in the AA group compared to the control group. A positive linear correlation between serum vitamin D and serum calcium was observed within the patient group. There was a strong positive correlation between the SALT score and the duration of the disease, with all patients experiencing total scalp and body hair loss having had the disease for over six months, whereas most of those with the disease for less than six months had low SALT scores.

The significance of vitamin D in hair follicle biology was noted, with the presence of vitamin D receptors (VDR) identified in keratinocytes and dermal papilla cells. The absence of VDR is linked to reduced epidermal differentiation and hampered hair growth. AA patients exhibited notably lower concentrations of both 25(OH)D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, and higher average parathyroid hormone levels than controls. Vitamin D and its analogs are suggested to potentially prevent autoimmune conditions like AA by activating regulatory T cells.

The prospective case-control study was ethically approved and included 50 subjects from Dakahlia Governorate, with participants providing informed consent. Blood samples were processed for CBC using an automated machine, while serum was separated for assessing various levels using ELISA kits supplied by different companies.

The present study's results were consistent with past findings regarding vitamin D's role in maintaining proper calcium levels. No significant PTH level difference was found between patients and controls, possibly due to small sample size, seasonal variation in vitamin D levels, or methodological variations.

The study was limited by the low number of participants, which was attributed to the rarity of AA and selective inclusion criteria. High investigation costs also posed restrictions. Although the sample size was small, it was deemed representative of the disease with various severity levels included. Further research is recommended with larger groups, extended durations, cooperative efforts, better funding, and refined statistical methods.

Additional limitations included the lack of a subgroup assessing the effects of vitamin D supplementation on AA severity and the fact that vitamin D levels were only measured once without considering ethnicity, skin color, or sun exposure, which could introduce biases in the results.
