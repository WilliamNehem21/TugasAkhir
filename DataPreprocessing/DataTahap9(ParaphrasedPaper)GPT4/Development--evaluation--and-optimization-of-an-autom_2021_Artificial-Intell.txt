The academic paper discusses cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp), a significant source of human protein that has been cultivated since the Neolithic era. The crop serves as both food and a raw material for industrial applications. Globally, over 8 million tons of dry cowpea seed are produced annually, mainly in Africa and Asia. Nevertheless, the largest exporters are America and Europe because Africa and Asia often fail to meet international export standards. The study aims to rectify this by creating an automated device capable of detecting and separating quality cowpea seeds for use in less developed producing countries.

An intelligent quality separation device with metering, automating, and belt conveying outlet units was engineered to improve the quality of cowpea seeds. The device's performance was tested by assessing its separating efficiency, throughput, and capacity. It achieved an impurity separation efficiency of 92%, a throughput of 2.689 kg/h, and a maximum capacity of 32.781 kg over 12 hours. The research identified how factors such as cowpea variety, export grades, and metering speed impacted these performance metrics. It was determined that the optimal metering speed for the device is 20 revolutions per minute (rpm) to ensure the best impurity separation results. This smart device can also play a vital role in the cowpea seed grading process, helping to produce seeds that meet export-grade quality.
