The academic paper discusses how C++ template metaprogramming is perceived to have similarities with functional programming but differs in syntax and style. It introduces a compile-time graph-rewriting engine inspired by the functional language Clean, emphasizing the importation of lazy evaluation strategies into C++. This enables the embedding of lazy functional-style code into C++ template metaprograms.

Template metaprogramming in C++ is identified as a technique for running algorithms during compile time, which shares many qualities with functional programming, despite C++'s imperative and object-oriented roots. The paper acknowledges challenges in reading and maintaining template metaprograms due to their complexity and lack of uniform standards.

The organization of the paper includes discussions on the relationship between C++ template metaprogramming and functional programming, the implementation of lazy evaluation, and a detailed explanation of transformation processes. The paper also highlights future work and related literature.

The application of C++ template metaprogramming includes type property checking, compile-time data structures, and creating active libraries. However, its adoption in the industry remains limited due to tedious syntax, long code, and varied naming conventions.

The paper illustrates lazy evaluation through an example using an infinite list construct like "enumfrom," demonstrating how the proposed graph-rewriting engine can simulate Clean's lazy evaluation within C++. Types and typedefs represent expressions, and the use of struct templates like "take," "sieve," and "enumfrom" parallel Clean's graph-rewriting rules.

A notable challenge is ensuring precise type matching for rewriting rules, as mismatches can lead to pattern matching failures. The engine does not currently handle multiple matching rules, which is suggested as a topic for future research.

Functional programming in C++ has been previously explored with libraries such as FC++ for runtime use. The paper also compares Boost.MPL, a comprehensive library for template metaprogramming, noting that it does not explicitly support lazy infinite data structures nor provide certain functional programming tools that the authors aim to introduce at compile-time.
