Remote sensing technology offers cost-effective and often freely available data, instrumental for a variety of applications. From a multidisciplinary approach, this data is modern in format (conducive for machine processing) and plentiful (approaching the realm of big data). Remote sensing data are crucial for data-centered labs, which depend on quick access to geoscientific information. Key advantages include broad spatial and temporal reach.

However, aligning remote sensing data such as Sentinel satellite images with geochemical data can be challenging due to spatial mismatches, prompting the use of Landsat data to ensure better spatial consistency. High-resolution Sentinel data were eventually used for predictive modeling because, despite the availability of hyperspectral data, multispectral data provide higher spatial resolution. This maximizes the volume of training data, avoiding the reduction that occurs when using hyperspectral data -- a consequence of the curse of dimensionality, where adding more features (spectral bands) can actually impair machine learning performance.

Some bands were omitted from analysis because of their lower resolution compared to others that were utilized (e.g., only certain bands from Landsat and Sentinel were selected). Preprocessing of remote sensing data involved steps like radiometric calibration using FLAASH method, atmospheric correction, geometric adjustment, and noise filtering to ensure data quality, particularly for tasks like mineral exploration or lithological classification.

For predictive modeling, geochemical data showing gold (Au) content needed to be integrated with remote sensing data in a paired feature-and-label format. The geochemical information, provided in various forms, including drill core and sampling data, was used to construct a geostatistical model depicting a 3D resource structure.

The relationship between spectral band intensities and Au concentrations was not straightforward and required understanding complex, nonlinear correlations. Furthermore, the performance of predictive models was examined over terrain types not encountered in training data to understand algorithm behavior in diverse environments. This is significant, as verifying the applicability of training data to unexplored locations (where remote sensing is most advantageous) can be a considerable challenge, particularly when the physical accessibility is restricted.
