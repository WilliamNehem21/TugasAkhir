The recent progress in developing improved and high-performance materials has prominently focused on creating conductive polymers such as polyaniline (PANI), polypyrrole (PPY), and polythiophene (PTH) due to their notable electrical conductivity, intriguing electrochemical characteristics, and ease of fabrication. These properties make conductive polymers promising for various industrial applications including battery components, electrochromic devices, sensors, and nonlinear optics. Among different conducting polymers based on aromatic compounds, Polyindole (PIN) has attracted particular attention because of its structural resemblance to the aforementioned polymers.

The study in question systematically reports on original complex optical studies of newly synthesized PIN using ferric chloride (FeCl3) as an oxidant at room temperature. There is an absence of previous literature on complex optical studies of PIN prepared with FeCl3 as an oxidant. The materials produced were characterized using techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), and ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy.

The research determined the optical bandgap energies for PIN with varying FeCl3 concentrations in the range of 4.630 to 5.224 eV, indicating the material's potential for certain applications. The refractive index of the synthesized PIN material decreases with increasing photon energy, displaying normal dispersion behavior. This indicates an interaction between photons and electrons within the material, which is crucial for developing optoelectronic devices where internal energy depends on photon energy.

Furthermore, the study observed that the extinction coefficient and refractive index decrease with an increase in photon energy, while the absorption coefficient increases and transmittance decreases. The real component of the dielectric constant falls slightly faster at higher photon energies but more slowly at lower energies. However, the imaginary component of the dielectric constant gradually reduces with increasing photon energy.

Summarizing the report, a successful investigation into the complex optical characteristics of PIN synthesized using various concentrations of FeCl3 via chemical polymerization at room temperature has been achieved. The amorphous nature of the synthesized material was confirmed through XRD and FE-SEM studies. The optical properties were studied over a wavelength range of 200-500 nm, detecting absorption primarily within 220-300 nm. The smallest optical energy bandgap measured at 4.6302 eV corresponded to PIN with 0.6 M FeCl3 concentration. UV-Vis spectroscopy helped to determine optical constants such as the extinction coefficient, refractive index, and real and imaginary dielectric constants. The optical conductivity was found to increase with wavelength due to enhanced absorption, particularly for PIN material synthesized with 0.6 M FeCl3.
