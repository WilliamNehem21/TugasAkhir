In the academic context described, the power received by each user is denoted as "Pr." During the second phase of operation, a group of 'Nx' users from the set 'G' are chosen to act as relays; these selected relays form the set 'Re.' These relays are then responsible for forwarding data to the users within the set 'B.' To ensure that all users are able to decode the data accurately across both stages, the relays transmit the data at a rate that the user with the poorest channel state information (CSI) can successfully decode. Consequently, the data transmission rate from the relays in the second stage is determined by the user with the worst CSI.
