The kappa-calculus is an abstract representational system that simplifies molecular interactions by using a type of graph-rewriting method. In this system, molecules are depicted as nodes with a defined number of attachment points, or sites, while molecular bonds are illustrated as links, or arcs, that connect these sites. Collectively, these nodes and bonds form structures called complexes, which represent interconnected graphs. Reactions within this framework are expressed through rewriting rules that have the power to alter a molecule's internal state, forge new bonds to signify the formation of complexes, or break existing bonds to indicate the splitting of complexes.

Additionally, kappa-calculus has a functionality that allows molecules to be notified of reactions occurring within other molecules that are part of the same complex. This feature enables molecules within a complex to potentially adjust their internal states once a reaction occurs. The viability of simulating systems described with nano-kappa, a version tailored towards nanoscale interactions, has been explored in previous studies.

A molecule 'a' in this system is characterized by a number of fields, signified by sf(a), and sites, denoted by ss(a). The integers 1, 2,... up to the number of fields (sf(a)) and the number of sites (ss(a)) define the structure of molecule 'a.' A value of zero for sf(a) or ss(a) indicates that the respective molecule lacks fields or sites.

The kappa language simulator KaSim incorporates the feature that assigns two distinct rates to a reaction: one for when the reacting molecules are unattached and freely moving, and the other for when they are connected within a complex. This dichotomy in reaction rates aids in resolving ambiguities in kappa rules for reactions between two molecules, 'a' and 'b,' which may be applicable in different contexts depending on whether 'a' and 'b' are connected. However, the integration of extensive physical or chemical properties, which could influence reaction rates based on the entirety of the involved complexes, becomes a complex challenge that limits the practical use of modeling in kappa.
