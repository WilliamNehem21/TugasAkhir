We provide a theoretical framework for examining concepts such as intersections, subsets, and statistical independency within the realm of categorical probability. To this end, we enhance standard probability constructs, exemplified by the Giry Monad, with a dual-monoidal framework. This denotes that we equip them with both a monoidal and opmonoidal structure, ensuring their compatibility, in other words, a bimonoidal structure. We further elucidate both the theoretical underpinnings and practical implications by utilizing the graphical calculus inherent to monoidal categories. Our development of stochastic independence is founded on the bimonoidal framework and aligns with intuitive understanding as well as other methodologies presented in literature for cartesian monoidal categories. We exemplify this by demonstrating that the Kantorovich Monad, operating within the realm of complete metric spaces, conforms to a bimonoidal monad, even though it functions within a non-cartesian monoidal structure.

However, not all probability monads found in academic literature satisfy the conditions of a bimonoidal monad, nor are they all necessarily robust. A notable exception is presented in the paper. While monads that do not meet the bimonoidal criterion may still be relevant in the realm of measure theory, especially for discussing measures, they lack practicality for probability theory. This is because they cannot facilitate discussions about key probabilistic concepts like stochastic independence and correlation. Consequently, we argue that for a monad to be legitimately considered a probability monad, embodying the essence of probability theory, it must possess the structure of a bimonoidal monad.

The Kantorovich Monad serves as a probability monad tailored to complete metric spaces and was initially conceptualized by van Breugel, focused initially on compact and complete 1-bounded metric spaces. In this paper, we adopt a broader scope based on definitions and outcomes that are applicable to all complete metric spaces.
