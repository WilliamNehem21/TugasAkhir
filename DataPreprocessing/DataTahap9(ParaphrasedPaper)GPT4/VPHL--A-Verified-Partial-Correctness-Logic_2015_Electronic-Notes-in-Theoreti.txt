The paper discusses VPHL (Verified Probabilistic Hoare Logic), a logic that is focused on full probability distributions and is capable of handling potentially non-terminating programs. It is crucial to note that VPHL has undergone formal verification using the Coq proof assistant. Given the increasing reliance on probabilistic Hoare logics for verifying critical code, such as in the EasyCrypt project, it is essential for the underlying logic to have a solid foundation.

The paper also mentions significant research in related formal systems like the probabilistic guarded command language (formalized in HOL4 and Isabelle/HOL), dynamic logic, and Kleene algebra with tests. It suggests looking into the work of Vasquez et al. for insights into the comparison between probabilistic Hoare logic and PGCL, and Chadha et al. for a more comprehensive discussion on probabilistic verification approaches.

VPHL is designed as a foundation for further research into probabilistic Hoare logics, as well as for their practical use. It is designed to be extensible to allow for the easy addition of new rules that won't affect the existing structure of the language. These new rules can be categorized into two groups: core rules and derived rules.

Derived rules are those that can be constructed from existing rules within the logic. While technically not necessary, they prove invaluable for streamlining and intuitively guiding the reasoning process for programs. Introducing such rules could greatly improve the usability and effectiveness of the logic.
