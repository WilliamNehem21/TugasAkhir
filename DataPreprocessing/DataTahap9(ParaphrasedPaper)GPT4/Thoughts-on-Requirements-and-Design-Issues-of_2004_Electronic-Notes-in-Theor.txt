The development of user interfaces (UIs) for theorem provers has not been as systematic as the development of proof assistants themselves. Projects from the 1990s show that many early attempts had minimal impact and were used by small groups, whereas today successful systems like ProofGeneral and interfaces for PVS and IMPS, which are based on (X)Emacs, have endured.

Theorem provers are often built using functional programming languages, such as those in the ML and Lisp families. These languages tend to lack robust graphical user interface (GUI) toolkits and support for concurrent processes. Efforts to blend functional languages with better GUI frameworks have resulted in more cumbersome development environments compared to using modern commercial GUI builders.

The resource intensiveness and specialist nature of building custom UIs mean that only a few academic institutions can afford to do so. There's an opportunity for efficiency gains in creating reusable UI components fostering greater collaboration and efficiency within the academic community.

To illustrate, consider a use case where the proof assistant adds a new logical constant to an existing theory, a common occurrence during theory development. The system should guide the user through this process with error messages, warnings, and feedback where appropriate.

Modern theorem provers are structured around types and associated operations, similar to how object-oriented languages use classes. Features such as auto-completion should be tailored to understand types and context, thus assisting the user more intelligently. Other user-friendly attributes include the hiding of irrelevant information, sorting menu items by their usage frequency, and implementing human-computer interaction (HCI) principles such as complementary views and undo operations.

Graphical user interfaces make computer use more accessible by allowing users to manipulate objects without needing to learn command languages. There should be an option to choose between text-based and graphical user interfaces, catering to individual preferences and expertise.

Customization should extend to various levels (project, theory, proof) with more specific settings overriding more general ones. Using a standard web browser for theory presentation is beneficial because of familiarity, hyperlinking, and customization through technologies like MathML, XML, XSLT, and CSS.

The UI should perform basic input validation and provide graphical support, but it should pass complex parsing tasks like formula processing directly to the proof assistant to facilitate batch processing and maintain logical rigor. Communication between UIs and proof assistant backends could effectively utilize XML messaging despite potential performance drawbacks, thanks to its platform independence and support across different programming languages and systems.
