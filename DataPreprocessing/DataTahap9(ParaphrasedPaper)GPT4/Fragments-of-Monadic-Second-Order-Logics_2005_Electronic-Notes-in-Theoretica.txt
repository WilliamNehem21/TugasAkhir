In the domain of finite graphs, R. Fagin has established that the existential portion of Monadic Second-Order logic (MSO) is significantly less powerful than the full MSO logic. A well-known example that demonstrates the difference in expressiveness between these two logical classes is the connectivity problem in directed graphs, which is also described in database contexts as a type of query; further information can be found in references [13,5].

This section moves on to outline the advanced Monadic Second-Order logics that will be examined in following sections. The text assumes that readers are already knowledgeable about Monadic Second-Order logic and its existential subset. Readers looking for comprehensive definitions can consult references [5,13,21]. The section also revisits some relevant results from descriptive complexity theory, which will be instrumental in demonstrating the distinctions in expressiveness.
