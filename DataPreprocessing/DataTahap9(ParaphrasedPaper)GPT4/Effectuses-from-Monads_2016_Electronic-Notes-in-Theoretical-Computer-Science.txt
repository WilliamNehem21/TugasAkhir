The academic paper asserts the significance of the Kleisli category Kl(T) being an effectus, a concept in category theory relevant to the study of computational effects. It emphasizes that several properties are essential for Kl(T) to qualify as an effectus. These properties are also valid for the associated category Kl(Tj), which deals with partial maps. The focus on partial maps within an effectus framework is a central aspect of the paper's argument. To demonstrate that Kl(T) constitutes an effectus, the critical properties related to partial maps must be considered and analyzed.
