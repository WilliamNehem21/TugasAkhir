Product Line Engineering (PLE) utilizes models to represent all valid products within a Product Line (PL), with Feature Models (FMs) being one key way to depict these models. FMs capture common and variable features, serving as a communicative tool among stakeholders during initial development stages.

This study aims to establish a universal method that pinpoints the root of various defects in PL models irrespective of the notation used. The paper introduces a novel approach for identifying and correcting defects in FMs by leveraging Minimal Correction Subsets (MCSes), a concept borrowed from constraint programming, which has not been previously applied in this context.

The proposed method involves three main steps: transforming the FM into a format suitable for constraints analysis, identifying the defects in this transformed model, and pinpointing corrections for each identified defect using MCSes. MCSes represent the smallest group of constraints that, when removed, resolve the unsolvable constraint program associated with the defect in the FM.

The novel algorithm designed for identifying MCSes systematically removes constraints from the model until a solution is found, with each eliminated constraint belonging to an MCS. To make the corrections understandable to designers without constraint programming knowledge, the identified MCSes are translated back into natural language corresponding to the FM.

An implementation in Java integrates this method within a tool, which is part of the Variamos suite, and facilitates the analysis of FMs in Simple XML Feature Model (SXFM) format, outputting results in an Excel file.

Initial evaluations on 78 different models assessed the method's accuracy and performance, examining the methodâ€™s ability to identify corrections that are both accurate and minimal. The study found interesting overlaps where removing certain dependencies corrected multiple defects simultaneously.

Comparisons with existing literature highlighted that while many techniques automate defect identification in FMs, none of them automatically suggest corrections. The proposed method not only identifies defects but also suggests how to repair them, providing a way to understand and apply corrections early in the development process, saving time and reducing costs in PL development.

Future work will involve refining this approach and exploring ways to integrate it with existing methods for detecting defects and their causes, thereby creating a comprehensive framework for both identifying and correcting FM defects.
