The field of Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) centers on understanding and designing systems that support the role of individuals within group contexts. This discipline does not view humans in isolation but as social beings engaged in collaborative work environments. Despite earlier attempts to categorize the plethora of CSCW systems that have emerged over time, existing taxonomies struggle to accommodate their increasing complexity. This paper introduces a new, adaptable taxonomy that better aligns with contemporary CSCW systems.

The term "computer-supported cooperative work" was first established during a cross-disciplinary workshop in the mid-1980s, which Paul Cashman and Irene Greif organized. It sought to explore how computer science could aid collaborative efforts.

Typically, CSCW systems aim to facilitate communication, coordination, and process support among users. As these systems become more prevalent and varied, the challenge of classifying them grows. Early classification schemes often employed a time-space matrix, but these have become less effective for the varied and intricate new systems that now exist.

While simple tools with a singular purpose, like chat applications, are easy to categorize, the challenge lies in classifying complex systems that encompass multiple functions, such as document management systems that handle version control, document sharing, publication, and group scheduling.

The paper proposes a taxonomy based on logical principles suited to the evolving nature of CSCW systems. This new framework categorizes tools relative to time and space, accounting for whether interactions occur in the same location or remotely, synchronously or asynchronously.

An example provided is the classification of email, highlighting its flexibility. Initially meant for communication across distant locations, it can also serve various purposes within the same physical space. The proposed classification framework is non-exclusive and adaptable, allowing tools like email to be categorized in multiple ways depending on their use.

The necessity for a revised classification is supported by a survey conducted among CSCW experts and postdoctoral students from various Spanish universities in August 2005, which indicated strong support for the new taxonomy.

Finally, the paper acknowledges groupware's evolving use cases, suggesting that tools designed for a specific function may adapt to additional purposes. This dynamic characteristic underscores the need for a flexible classification system that can evolve alongside the CSCW tools it categorizes.
