In this paper, the authors present an approach that integrates adaptive step-size methods in numerical analysis, allowing the size of time steps to be adjusted dynamically based on the needs of the analysis. Advantages of this approach include improving precision by reducing step size to closely match discrete transition times or maintain a specific level of accuracy, and increasing efficiency by enlarging the step size when possible. Additionally, users can set their own error tolerance to strike a balance between accuracy and computational speed.

They adapt the Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg 4/5 (RKF45) method to approximate the continuous behavior of models, with the step size varying according to user-defined error tolerance. The method's implementation in Real-Time Maude is detailed, as well as the outcomes and execution times from simulations and model checking across various error tolerances in two thermal system cases.

The paper is organized to first cover Real-Time Maude, followed by their modeling approach for hybrid systems using rewriting logic. It then describes the adaptation of RKF45 for the models and its implementation. After presenting case studies, it concludes with final remarks.

Sources of errors in this methodology are noted as round-off (from computer number representation limits) and discrete-time approximation (deviation from exact values). The authors address the computational cost of obtaining a local error estimate using a higher order method by using embedded pairs like in RKF45, where the 5th order method estimates the local error of the 4th order method with shared function values.

Various attributes on the modeling system are also explained, such as modes of computation across different states, numerical methods, step size regulation, error tolerance, safety factors, and error control.

Results show that temperature changes in a simulated coffee cooling example relate to error tolerances set by the modeler. The execution strategy in this implementation checks for discrete event occurrence before time step advancement, as events occurring within a step are executed after the step.

To summarize, the authors have adapted the adaptive step-size technique using RKF45 for modeling interactive physical systems. Their results show that lower error tolerances result in higher accuracy and computational demand. They also identify a limitation in the execution strategy for hybrid behavior when using adaptive step size techniques.
