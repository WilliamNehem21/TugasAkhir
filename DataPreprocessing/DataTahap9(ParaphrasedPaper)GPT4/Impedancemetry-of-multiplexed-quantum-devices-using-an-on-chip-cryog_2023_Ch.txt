The paper discusses advancements in quantum computing, focusing on the challenges of scaling qubit numbers and integrating control electronics. Solid-state approaches are highlighted as the most promising for scalability, with superconducting qubits being the current leaders and CMOS spin qubits based on silicon technology emerging as strong competitors. Recent developments in Si/Ge heterostructures, including a 6-qubit quantum processor, are promising.

Cooling requirements for quantum processors are typically below 0.1 K, but silicon qubits have shown fidelity with limited loss at temperatures above 1 K. To scale up, the integration of cryogenic classical electronics near the qubits is critical. Various low-temperature transistor components for cryo-electronics have been demonstrated, including multiplexers and signal converters, amplifiers, oscillators, and more complex circuits for qubit control at 4 K to minimize cooling power requirements. CMOS-based controllers can improve the fidelity of operations on both silicon spin qubits and superconducting qubits and include qubit-readout components as well. These cryogenic controllers reduce the need for numerous electrical lines that pose a heat load within the cryostat.

Qubit state measurement requires sensitive detection of capacitance variations in an LC tank circuit through radio frequency (RF) reflectometry. However, current inductive elements are too large for large-scale qubit integration. Active CMOS inductor solutions have been explored to achieve high inductance density, low noise, and reduced power consumption for better compatibility with qubit scaling. An RF current source and an amplifier complete the measurement circuit, allowing for high-sensitivity tuning and the ability to measure extremely low capacitances.

Active inductors, consisting of transistors and capacitors, offer a much higher inductance density than passive inductors and only have capacitive coupling, which is beneficial for dense scaling. In contrast, passive inductors face challenges with their longer-range magnetic coupling. An impedancemetry chip, made with commercial 28nm CMOS FD-SOI technology and designed for sensitive capacitance detection, is utilized for in-situ measurements, showing the potential for measuring quantum phenomena with on-chip resonators.

The chip leveraging these advances is wire-bonded on a package that's then soldered onto a printed circuit board, indicating progress towards integrating these technologies into a practical quantum computing architecture.
