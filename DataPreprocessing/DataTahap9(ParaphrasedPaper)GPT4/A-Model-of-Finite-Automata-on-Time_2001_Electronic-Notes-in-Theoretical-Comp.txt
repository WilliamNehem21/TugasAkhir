In Lemma 3.1, it is stated that for a timed tree automaton (A) which could belong to any of the categories TMTA (Timed Muller Tree Automata), TBT (Timed Büchi Tree Automata), DMTA (Deterministic Timed Muller Tree Automata), or DTBTA (Deterministic Timed Büchi Tree Automata), one can construct another timed tree automaton (A') that also falls into the same category and has a nondivergent clock feature. The set of timed trees recognized by A (denoted as T(A)) is identical to the set of timed trees recognized by A' (denoted as T(A')). This implies that converting an automaton with potentially divergent clocks to one with nondivergent clocks does not change the language it recognizes.
