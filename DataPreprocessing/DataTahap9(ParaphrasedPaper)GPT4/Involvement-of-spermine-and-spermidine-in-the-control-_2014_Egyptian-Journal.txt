An experiment using pots was conducted to explore the protective effects of pre-soaking wheat grains (Triticum aestivum L. variety Sakha 94) in spermine (0.15 mM) and spermidine (0.3 mM) against the damage caused by irrigation with wastewater contaminated with heavy metals. Wastewater concentrations used were 25%, 50% and 100%. It was found that using wastewater for irrigation significantly reduced various measures of wheat yield, such as weight of 100 kernels, grain yield per plant, straw yield per plant, and overall water use efficiency.

Both spermine and spermidine were found to lessen the negative impacts of heavy metal contamination from the wastewater on wheat yield and water utilization. Moreover, the presence of chloride, heavy metals, and abscisic acid was increased in the produced wheat grains due to wastewater irrigation. Nevertheless, treatment with polyamines seemed to counteract the detrimental effect of wastewater on these biochemical aspects of wheat grains.

The analysis of protein patterns revealed in the grains showed induction of new proteins in response to wastewater exposure, with molecular weights of 73, 70, 24, 20, and 15 kDa. Notably, spermidine treatment alone induced additional new proteins with molecular weights of 73, 70, 57, 24, and 23 kDa.

Untreated wastewater from industrial sources like paper, automobile, textile, and food industries is alkaline and contains various chemical species. Using these effluents untreated can change the physicochemical properties of soil and negatively affect seed germination. Municipal and industrial wastewater commonly used in suburban areas often contain heavy metals, which persist in the environment and can be harmful.

Polyamines have been documented to play a significant role in plant cell elongation and division and are known to assist in stress responses by increasing in plant cells under stressful conditions. For example, putrescine accumulates in plant cells under various stress conditions and can be considered a stress marker.

When wheat plants were irrigated with normal tap water versus varying concentrations of wastewater, the content of growth hormones like abscisic acid, indole-3-acetic acid, gibberellic acid, and cytokinins in grains changed measurably. Polyamines seemed to regulate stress responses due to heavy metals by changing internal growth regulators, with noticeable effects on the protein content and the resilience of wheat plants to heavy metal stress.

Overall, pre-soaking wheat grains in polyamines before growing them with wastewater irrigation appeared to provide a protective effect, mitigating the damaging influence of heavy metals on plant yield and grain quality. This was especially notable in the synthesis of specific new proteins, which might play a role in enhancing the wheat plant's tolerance to heavy metal stress.
