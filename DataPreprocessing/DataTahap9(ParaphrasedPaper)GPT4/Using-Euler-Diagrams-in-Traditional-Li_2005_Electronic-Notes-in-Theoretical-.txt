This paper introduces a novel graphical user interface designed to enhance search strategies in library databases. The interface utilizes two linked interactive Euler diagrams to assist users in understanding and navigating the library's content structure and to efficiently process search results. The primary diagram helps users explore the library's core documents, while the secondary diagram visually organizes query results, enabling users to refine their searches and manage the information obtained. The interface caters specifically to users who may not be familiar with traditional library search techniques, simplifying the experience through intuitive navigation and interactive elements.

Key components of the library's core, such as graphs, trees, and lists, are visually represented in a unified fashion, which current interfaces lack. Thesauri, complex elements of the library database, are also integrated into the process, aiding both document indexing and retrieval to enhance precision in searches.

The navigation of the interface is designed around focus changes and zoom features, allowing users to delve into specific items within the library database by clicking and zooming on nodes, with smooth transitions guided by animation.

The 'DocumentSearcher' section of the interface enables the visualization of up to five search queries concurrently, each represented by a distinct contour or 'contour query.' This set-based cartographic representation aids users in understanding the database content in relation to their searches.

The interface limits its display to Euler diagrams with elliptical curves for clarity and can handle a maximum of five contour queries. The system accommodates the typical user behavior, which rarely involves more than five parallel queries and often relies on iterative query formulation.

The graphical interface supports users with easy-to-use tools that allow them to modify the scope of their search terms based on the library's documentation structure and to quickly analyze the document distribution across queries. While the interface enhances user strategy and efficiency, the success of extrapolating search terms ultimately relies on the user's knowledge and capability.

In summary, the paper proposes a user-friendly graphical interface that simplifies the search process within library environments by combining interactive visual tools with intuitive navigation and result management capabilities. The interface is especially beneficial for users unfamiliar with complex research methods, providing a more accessible and effective way to explore library databases.
