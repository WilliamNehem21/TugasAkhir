To comprehensively evaluate a specific local area, a series of experiments were carried out using a dual-manipulator system with 12 degrees of freedom. The findings demonstrate that the adaptive region boosting (ARB) method notably enhances the success rate, surpassing other comparable techniques in a range of dynamic conditions.

Path planning is a crucial topic in robotics with applications in aviation, industrial manufacturing, and virtual environments. Due to the computational complexity of the generalized motion planning problem, which is PSPACE-hard, sampling-based approaches such as the probabilistic roadmap method (PRM) and rapidly exploring random tree (RRT) have been developed. These methods are probabilistically complete and have been successful in solving path planning challenges.

This paper introduces a hierarchical sampling strategy during the preprocessing phase to construct roadmaps and an update phase that dynamically adjusts sample density in complex regions. The paper is organized into sections that cover related work, methodology, experiments, analysis, and conclusions.

Dynamic Bridge Builder (DBB), a planner that efficiently handles challenging regions in dynamic environments, has been developed. DBB creates sample points, constructs roadmaps, and identifies "bridges" that highlight difficult areas such as narrow passages. Two strategies, DBB-I and DBB-II, are implemented to enhance these regions; one increases sampling near bridges, while the other uses Parzen-window estimation and delays collision checks.

Active learning algorithms, which adapt and classify regions from acquired data, are employed in this work, along with Parzen-window techniques, widely used in various prediction and classification tasks. The paper defines "biased entropy" as a real-time metric to estimate the difficulty of a region based on sampling points, reflecting the dynamic change degree of the region over time.

The ARB method proposed in this study aims to adaptively enhance difficult regions to identify clear paths efficiently. The research also investigates the impact of different parameter values, such as the entropy calculation parameter 'k,' on the planner's performance through multiple experiments.

The paper details a two-step approach where main points are initially used to construct the roadmap and incremental points are added but remain inactive until needed. The validity of these points and their connection to the roadmap are determined in the update phase.

Experimental outcomes show that the ARB method maintains high success rates even with fast-moving obstacles, showcasing its adaptability and effectiveness in various environments. The paper concludes by suggesting future research avenues, such as tracking obstacle movement and predicting regional changes, to further enhance the dynamic roadmap method (DRM).
