Spatial data structures, which handle geographical or location-based information, present unique visualization challenges not seen with one-dimensional data. Visual representations of such structures employ various visual metaphors that vary in their level of abstraction, according to the visualization's intent. This paper outlines four levels of abstraction for data structure visualization and how they can be considered in the depiction of spatial data structures.

Spatial data structures, essential in fields like GIS, robotics, computer graphics, and virtual reality, stem from basic data structures, including arrays, lists, and trees. These structures aid in organizing spatial data, which is inherently multidimensional, adding to the complexity of related algorithms. Despite the significance of spatial data structures and algorithms, a comprehensive educational resource is lacking.

The paper emphasizes the importance of visuals in geoinformatics, where maps and diagrams facilitate comprehension. While visualizing a list through its arrays may show implementation details, its logical structure is better understood through a node and reference diagram. The study focuses on the role of Algorithm Visualization (AV) in software visualization (SV), underlining the necessity of active learning when using visualization tools in education.

The study proposes a tiered model for visualizing data structures, which includes the following:

1. Basic structure level: The lowest abstraction level, using canonical views of archetypes like arrays, linked lists, trees, and graphs, provides a common visualization across implementations, despite their actual physical forms.

2. Data structure level: Depictions at this level reflect precise implementations of data structures, focusing on layout and adherence to structural constraints, with considerations for multi-dimensional data representations.

3. Representation level: Offers a mathematical perspective of data that is independent of computerized data structures, demonstrating logical data relationships.

4. Application level: The highest abstraction level, using visual metaphors to represent relevant data within a given context, often seen in specialized fields like geoinformatics.

The paper further elaborates on how these visualization levels apply to spatial data algorithms, using map overlay—a common geoinformatics challenge—as an example to demonstrate multiple levels of abstraction.

Ultimately, the paper asserts that multiple, synchronized visualizations are beneficial when working with spatial data algorithms to provide a comprehensive understanding of both the data structure composition and the data itself. This enriches the learning experience in geoinformatics and other visually inclined disciplines, advocating for the repeated utilization of these visualization abstractions across various domains.
