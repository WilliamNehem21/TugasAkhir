This study presents a model that integrates sensing, security, and performance considerations within a Cognitive Radio Network (CRN). In the proposed system, when a Secondary User (SU) detects an available encryption node, data is encrypted before transmission. The model incorporates a security mechanism that halts the CRN's activity if an intrusion is detected. The impact of encryption and security measures on the system is evaluated, allowing for the identification of an optimal sensing duration that maximizes the overall tradeoff between sensing, security, and performance. The model uses the sensing duration as a benchmark to assess the improvements in performance due to the system's ability to scale.
