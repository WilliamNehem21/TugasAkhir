Research suggests that the soil disinfection impacts on bacterial communities are not fully understood. Soil treatments with the chemical fumigant chloropicrin and the biofumigant mustard greens (Brassica juncea) were studied to assess their effects on these communities. Mustard greens appeared to have a negligible impact on soil bacterial structures while chloropicrin significantly reduced soil biomass and bacterial diversity. Chloropicrin treatment led to Firmicutes becoming the majority in soil bacterial communities, though over time their dominance decreased and Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria regained prominence.

To further assess soil dynamics, the study included treatments with wheat bran and low concentrations of ethanol, which did not alter bacterial community structures. Beta diversity analysis indicated that, except for chloropicrin-treated soils, bacterial communities tended to cluster together.

Chloropicrin operates as a potent soil sterilizer and might eliminate weeds effectively, but it also disrupts bacterial community structures significantly and prevents recovery to the original state for an extended period. In contrast, mustard greens, wheat bran, and ethanol treatments were less impactful on bacterial structures, suggesting they are milder alternatives but not as effective for weed control. Moreover, mustard greens can serve as carbon sources for soil reduction and release biotoxic isothiocyanates upon decomposition, providing potential for biofumigation and a substitute to synthetic pesticides like chloropicrin.

The study concludes that while chloropicrin drastically affects soil bacterial communities, milder alternatives like mustard greens offer a less damaging approach for soil treatment.
