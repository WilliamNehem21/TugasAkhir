This paper presents the integration of the semantic models of CCSP, a process algebra for modeling long-running business transactions with compensation orchestration capabilities, into the PVS theorem prover. Using PVS's recursive datatype capabilities, the authors define the terms of the CCSP process algebra and its trace and operational semantics. They demonstrate the use of PVS to establish and verify a relationship between these semantic models through PVS's powerful induction tools.

CCSP is a language aimed at representing complex business interactions, particularly focusing on error recovery in long transactions, integrating compensation actions within the standard CSP framework. Mechanizing these semantic models in a theorem prover like PVS helps avoid potential errors in manual proofs by providing automated proof assistance.

The authors gave a high-level overview of CCSP, its trace semantics, and its operational semantics. They detailed how semantic relationships are characterized and initially proved by hand before explaining how they embedded CCSP into PVS. The embedding involved defining the algebra's terms and semantics in PVS, proving relationships between models, and utilizing PVSâ€™s induction schemes to support proofs at a comparable level of detail as manual proofs.

The authors highlight that mechanization forces precision in handling recursion and typing rules, which in turn clarifies theorem and lemma definitions. This process revealed additional insights and lemmas not explored in manual proofs, enhancing their understanding of the semantic models for both standard and compensable processes.

Some areas, like synchronous composition semantics, were not covered, as they require extensive separate treatment. The paper concludes with the intent for future work on expanding the coverage of CCSP operators in the experiments, modeling business transactions more thoroughly, and refining the language features based on these investigations.
