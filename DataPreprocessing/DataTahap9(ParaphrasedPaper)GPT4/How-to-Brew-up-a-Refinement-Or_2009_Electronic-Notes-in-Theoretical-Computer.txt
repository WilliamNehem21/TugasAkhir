In this paper, the ambiguity arises from the colloquial use of language. Clearly, the variable 'h' isn't physically observable at the earlier mentioned time. However, the attacker isn't constrained to immediate analysis. Instead, they can collect a multitude of data points and scrutinize them at their convenience. The critical aspect is that they are capable of inferring the value of 'h' from a previous instance, despite making the actual deduction at a subsequent time.
