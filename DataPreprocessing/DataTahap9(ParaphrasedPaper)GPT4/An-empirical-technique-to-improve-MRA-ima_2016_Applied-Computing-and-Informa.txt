Kim and Park developed a technique for segmenting the carotid artery in MRA images, which involves a local adaptive thresholding method capable of autonomously determining the threshold by averaging the highest and lowest grayscale values of the slice. Following the threshold application and filtering of the initial slice, the image is divided into two sections reflecting the left and right carotid arteries. Then, starting points are identified for each subsection, and the eight surrounding pixels are classified to designate the area of interest.

Priyadharshini and Anitha employed a region-growing algorithm to aid in the diagnosis of glaucoma through imaging techniques, enhancing the approach with preprocessing, morphological operations like dilation and erosion, and median filtering. The result was an improved method that delivered better image quality and more pronounced edges than traditional threshold-based methods.

In the paper, the authors present improvements to the region-growing algorithm, focusing on accurately setting threshold values, choosing optimal seed points, and determining the starting slice number. Additionally, they introduced a two-pass technique designed for 8-connected neighbors within grayscale images. By integrating these elements into the region-growing algorithm (RGA) and assessing the performance for image enhancement, the proposed modifications aim to refine the algorithm's application and effectiveness.
