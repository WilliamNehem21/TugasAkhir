This paper introduces an enhancement to the environment generation process for fl-systems, utilizing a cache mechanism that surpasses standard approaches. The innovation lies in dynamically expanding a set of rewriting rules, thereby allowing more terms to achieve their normal form through the application of just one rule, increasing efficiency.

The central challenge with fl-systems is the expense of the rewriting phase when compared to thorough descriptions. This cost is mitigated by reusing outcomes from prior rewritings. In urban scenarios, identical buildings or windows are often represented repeatedly. A cache allows for the direct reuse of a geometric object for such repeated modules without redrafting.

The paper unfolds with an introduction to streamlined fl-systems, follows with a section detailing the formal dynamic dependency analysis with cache-relevant properties, and then discusses the practical application of cache theory. The final section addresses related work and conclusions.

Fl-systems, according to this paper, are context-dependent rewriting systems that structurally detail elements within an environment. These descriptions are more concise and generic than full 3D environment representations, facilitating easier recycling of past design efforts.

A valid fl-system implies that any module will rewrite to a unique normal form regardless of variable values; essentially, each rewritten result consists solely of terminal elements without any ambiguity in module naming.

The paper articulates a technique that dynamically identifies the largest possible set of terms that can structurally connect with the term being rewritten. Inspired by confidentiality research, the revised semantics handle labeled parameters, allowing the derivation of normal form terms linked with labels influenced by the structure-determining parameters.

The cache system utilizes this approach to identify a potentially infinite set of modules with a known normal form structure, but doesn't ascertain the specific terminal values within the term. To derive a term with exact numerical values, an evaluation function processes the label-connected normal form term with a corresponding value store.

In essence, a label construction method ensures applying the same rewriting rule to modules with structurally identical parameters. Therefore, even with different parameter values, the resulting terms remain structurally identical, while numerical evaluation achieves precise matching in the normal form outcomes.

The paper thus differentiates between structural sameness (Corollary 3.5) and complete sameness including values (Corollary 3.8) for terms produced from rewritten modules in the fl-systems cache.
