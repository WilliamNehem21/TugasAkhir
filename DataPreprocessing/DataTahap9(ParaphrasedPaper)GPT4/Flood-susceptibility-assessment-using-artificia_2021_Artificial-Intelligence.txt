Flooding stands out as a catastrophic natural disaster, causing extensive damage and loss of life globally. Indonesia is particularly vulnerable, with its most populous islands, Java, Bali, and Sumatra, facing substantial flood risks. Jakarta, the densely populated capital city on Java, has been prone to flooding since the 5th century. Contributing factors to this ongoing threat include a large part of the city being below sea level and intensifying issues like climate change, sea-level rise, land subsidence, and extreme weather.

In early 2020, Jakarta experienced unprecedented rainfall that led to severe flooding, resulting in casualties and tens of thousands displaced, thus highlighting the necessity for effective flood prediction and management.

With advancements in machine learning, specifically artificial neural networks (ANNs), researchers have been exploring these tools to forecast flood susceptibility by analyzing various environmental factors and historical data. The goal is to provide actionable information to manage resources and alert the population of impending flood risks.

This study seeks to develop advanced machine-learning models, including ANNs, k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), and support vector machines (SVMs), to predict Jakarta's flood susceptibility. Comparisons among these models and the inclusion of a temporal dimension aim to determine the optimal forecasting tool. The research evaluates various factors influencing flood risks, such as elevation, proximity to rivers, and precipitation patterns. It also employs satellite imagery for flood monitoring.

The study underscores the importance of hyperparameter tuning and data-handicapping challenges, like missing values and imbalanced datasets. The efficacy of the proposed models will be benchmarked against a random baseline, using precision and recall metrics to ensure they perform better than mere chance.

By focusing on Jakarta's villages and applying machine learning to assess flood risk, the study endeavors to offer better predictive accuracy, helping prioritize flood defenses and alerting stakeholders in advance. Notably, the ANN model demonstrated superior performance in predicting floods, suggesting that this may be a favorable approach in such complex, dynamic settings.
