The paper examines the impact of immersive technology, like virtual reality (VR), on user experience through factors such as presence, engagement, and enjoyment, along with learning outcomes as influenced by affective and cognitive factors according to Achievement Emotion Theory and the work of Makransky and others. The study investigates how the presence of fire in VR and user frustration affect learning in a VR fire-escape program and how self-efficacy mediates this process.

Key Findings:
- Users experience a sense of "presence" in VR similar to real-world interactions, which can enhance learning efficacy.
- The study suggests that high-presence environments can boost confidence in using VR.
- The presence of fire in VR plays a significant role after users interact with the fire-escape program.
- The research highlights the importance of game-play self-efficacy in maximizing VR program potential to provide new knowledge and skills safely.
- Frustration can impede learning progress by reducing self-efficacy, as users allocate cognitive resources to navigating VR technology rather than focusing on the learning task.
- Emotional reactions to frustration may lead to lower self-efficacy, and VR programs should aim to minimize these tech-related frustrations.
- Vivid visual and auditory representations (presence) in VR combined with reduced frustration are key for building higher gameplay self-efficacy and fostering deep learning, even with life-threatening stimuli.

Recommendations:
- VR programs are beneficial for training adolescents in handling stressful, life-threatening events such as fires.
- Realistic representation of such scenarios in VR is necessary, and technological barriers should be lowered to enhance learning.
- Developers should focus on creating authentic VR environments to facilitate self-efficacy and skill mastery.

Cautions:
- The study's quasi-experimental design doesn't establish causality, only correlation.
- The small effect size of gameplay self-efficacy on learning progress suggests more variables could be influencing outcomes.
- The content might have been too simple for the high school students participating, who perhaps were already familiar with the material.
- The study did not compare learners who had practiced with the VR fire-escape program against those who hadn't in terms of learning effectiveness.
- Results are only generalizable to high school students, and studies with other age groups are necessary to validate the effectiveness of the VR fire-escape program.
