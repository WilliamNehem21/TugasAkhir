The paper describes Philips Healthcare's adoption of a formal component-based software development process, which incorporates Verum's Analytical Software Design (ASD) methodology, supported by the ASD:Suite tool, for creating control components in the power control service of an interventional X-ray system. Using formal techniques like compositional verification and automated code generation, alongside test-driven development for other components, Philips aims to improve multi-site development, integration, and third-party component compatibility.

The paper is organized to present the combination of formal and traditional development methods, the role and implementation of the power control service (PCS), project outcomes, main observations, and future work. The work entails creating and refining design models and interface models per component, leveraging formal verification to ensure model correctness and auto-generating source code. The PCS components behaved robustly against system failures and asynchrony. No major redesigns were required, changes were efficiently managed, and overall PCS quality significantly outperformed industry standards, with a defect rate of only 0.17 per thousand lines of code.

The experiences indicate advantages in error detection, ease of integration, and reduced field failures, yet acknowledge the challenge of ensuring the collective functionality of many small components. Future explorations include additional formal techniques for functional verification and model-based testing for conformance.
