The LTE standard utilizes a turbo encoder comprising two parallel convolutional encoders linked by an interleaver. This turbo encoder has a native code rate of 1/3 and employs two specific polynomials, denoted as g0 and g1, for its operation. Among the two considered interleaver designs – the Quadratic Permutation Polynomial (QPP) and Almost Regular Permutation (ARP) – the QPP was selected for its ability to enhance system throughput. The chosen QPP interleaver facilitates conflict-free parallel operations, which allows for greater parallelism in turbo encoding. Within the context of LTE, the inverse polynomial for the QPP interleaver is set to 4.

The original 1/3 rate output from the turbo encoder is then adjusted for transmission through a process called rate matching (RM). This process involves selectively puncturing (removing) or repeating bits from the turbo-encoded block to match the desired effective code rate (ECR) for the channel conditions.

Lower modulation schemes tend to transmit fewer bits per symbol, which extends the symbol duration, reduces the required signal bandwidth, and enhances Bit Error Rate (BER) performance. However, they also result in lower data transmission rates. 

Higher Channel Quality Indicator (CQI) values signal the use of higher modulation orders and greater ECRs, enabling higher bit rates. However, this increase in signal bandwidth can lead to more overlap and a deteriorated BER, especially in low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) conditions. Higher CQIs necessitate a trade-off in the form of requiring higher SNR levels.

The study demonstrates that in an LTE system employing downlink transmission with Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM), the BER remains relatively consistent across various channel bandwidths. This is attributed to the OFDM technique's inherent resistance to Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI) at high data rates. In addition to OFDM, the use of turbo coding, interleaving, and Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request (HARQ) retransmissions plays a critical role in maintaining low BER levels in the system.
