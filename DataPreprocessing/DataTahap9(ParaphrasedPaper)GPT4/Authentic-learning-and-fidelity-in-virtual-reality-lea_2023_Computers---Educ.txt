In this academic paper, the authors explore the impact of using a Virtual Reality Learning Environment (VRLE) on graduate students' practice of specific skills, such as conducting interviews with patients, within a collaborative and authentic learning scenario. The study is grounded in Situated Learning Theory, which suggests that knowledge is best acquired in contexts that closely mimic real-life situations where learners can engage and interact with their environment and others, including experienced professionals.

The paper stresses the importance of creating learning experiences that reproduce the complexities of real-world settings, which is crucial for enhancing memory recall and skill transfer. The authenticity of a learning environment is defined by its task, environment, and culture while aiming for high functional and fidelity in the VRLE to emulate responses from the real world closely.

The use of Second Life as the VR platform for counseling training is examined because it provides the physical and functional authenticity necessary for students to effectively learn interviewing and diagnostic skills. The learning outcomes for these VRLE activities emphasize the development of both facilitative and clinical skills required for patient interviews.

Data were collected across three activities (literature review, video, and the VRLE) for two different units of study, and a mixed-method research design was employed to interpret the findings from both qualitative and quantitative perspectives. The paper highlights the important role of learner motivation, engagement, and enjoyment in the learning process, all of which are influenced by the authenticity of the environment.

According to the study's findings, learners displayed varying levels of confidence and self-efficacy after participating in the VRLE exercise. Some students felt more confident, while others felt less so, resulting in unexpected metacognitive reflections on their skills and knowledge gaps. These variations, revealed through qualitative data, suggest that VRLE can have a diverse impact on learning processes.

The paper acknowledges limitations, such as limited prior studies for theoretical groundwork, a single-instructor course as the research setting, and the potential generalizability issues due to technological constraints, such as the ability to leverage high-fidelity interaction within the VRLE.

In conclusion, students regarded the VRLE as an authentic learning context, yet some faced technology-related challenges affecting their experience. Future VRLE designs should consider optimal technological performance and provide proper onboarding to familiarize learners with the technology for a better learning experience.
