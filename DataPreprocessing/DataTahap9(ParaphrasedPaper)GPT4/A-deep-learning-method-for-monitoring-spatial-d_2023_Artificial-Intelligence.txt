The Ghost module is devised to generate additional feature maps while utilizing fewer parameters, and this method was implemented to enhance the processing of feature maps derived from chickens. When using the YOLOv5 network's neck component, the feature maps associated with chickens appear indistinct. The incorporation of the Ghost module has shown improvements, where a1, b1, and c1 denote the dimensions—height, width, and channels—of the resultant feature map post-convolution. The term c refers to the number of channels in the provided feature map input, and n represents the dimension of the convolution kernels used.

An extensive dataset for laying hens was compiled to assess the ameliorated YOLOv5 model's performance in identifying birds. This dataset documents the complete growth cycle of poultry from 1 to 36 weeks of age, including both baby chicks and mature hens, and contains a random selection of 3000 images excerpted from video footage. The labeling of these images was carried out using the LabelImg tool, version Windows_v1.6.1. In this classification, chicks below two weeks old were categorized as baby chicks, whereas those two weeks and older were identified as pullets/hens. For the purposes of training and testing the model, a split was used with 2400 images for training and 600 images for evaluation. Training took place in a Python QT5 application environment for a duration of 300 epochs, applying a learning rate of 0.01, and a batch size of 16.

Unfortunately, the improved method is not without issues, such as misidentifications due to certain factors. The first mentioned is the "horizontal vision factor," which implies that the model sometimes fails to detect very small chicks when viewed on a horizontal plane. Another noted limitation is related to the design of the perch zone; if the perch zone is designed more narrowly than the actual perch area, fewer chicks on the perch are included in the designated zone, leading to omissions in detection. The study reports false detection rates at 0.004, indicating a low, but non-negligible, rate of errors.
