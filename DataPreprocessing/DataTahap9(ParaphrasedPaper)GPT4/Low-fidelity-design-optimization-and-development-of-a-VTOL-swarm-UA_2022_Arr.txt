This paper discusses the challenges faced by undergraduate students and novice designers, specifically in the aircraft design arena, where cross-disciplinary knowledge is crucial. These individuals often lack access to integrated learning resources, which hinders their ability to produce quality designs. Furthermore, students are constrained by the commercial design tools available, which offer limited insights into the learning and customization processes. Open-source software and custom-built libraries or components are proposed as suitable alternatives, as they provide an opportunity to learn from the ground up while granting the ability to tailor tools to specific needs.

The paper goes on to describe the rarity of completing a full design-to-autopilot-testing cycle in academic settings due to budgetary restrictions or the pressure to produce research within tight time frames. To support the growing fields of unmanned aerial systems and swarm robotics, the authors suggest that a comprehensive guide could address these issues. The paper aims to provide such a guide using free tools and self-developed codes, specifically to assist students and new researchers in creating viable designs for educational purposes or competitions.

The authors note that the complexity of aircraft design often leads to suboptimal solutions based on intuition alone, emphasizing the need for multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO). Although the paper's approach does not present a comprehensive MDO strategy, it offers a novel, low-fidelity method for design exploration, keeping a human in the loop for decision-making and validation.

Regarding the design specifications of an aircraft capable of vertical take-off and landing (VTOL), the paper considers current trends to determine the necessary thrust-to-weight ratio (T/W). A minimum T/W of 1.5 is deemed necessary for a hovering aircraft to maneuver effectively, while a T/W of 0.75 suffices for cruising. Initial thrust is calculated to ensure optimal performance of forward motors in cruise, with the thrust of the rear motor, used only during hover, optimized accordingly.

Lastly, the paper highlights the advantages of lithium-ion batteries for electric propulsion due to their superior energy density compared to lithium polymer batteries, despite the former's limitations in current discharge. An evaluation of the current draw across all flight segments confirms the suitability of lithium-ion batteries for the proposed design.
