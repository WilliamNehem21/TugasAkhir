Angelic nondeterminism is a concept used both in program specifications and concurrent programming languages that allows for choices to be made that ensure successful execution whenever possible. This idea is often embodied in programming through constructs that enable backtracking to find successful outcomes.

The study of angelic nondeterminism has primarily been approached through weakest precondition semantics, revealing the complexity of capturing both angelic and demonic nondeterminism within the Unifying Theories of Programming (UTP) model. The paper discusses the challenges and limitations of the existing UTP relational models in representing these types of nondeterminism.

The authors propose a new approach, introducing both a set-based relational model and a predicate transformer model tailored for UTP. They show that these models can mirror each other, providing a more coherent understanding of the UTP framework. This work is vital in furthering the definition of a UTP theory that can encompass both angelic and demonic nondeterminism.

Additionally, the paper details the essential constructs of the UTP, such as healthiness conditions that ensure program designs function as intended. By extending the concepts of alphabetised relations and designs, the authors illustrate how programs' start and termination can be captured, enabling discussions on total correctness.

The authors also suggest that complex relational models are necessary to capture angelic nondeterminism fully and indicate that new operator definitions will be more intricate than in the original UTP framework.

The relational models proposed are shown to be isomorphic to predicate transformers and build upon prior research, establishing functional semantics for languages that include angelic nondeterminism. Furthermore, the work sets out to integrate these new models within a comprehensive framework suitable for applications like concurrency and higher-order programming and to verify refinement laws within this extended semantic structure.

Finally, the paper acknowledges related works on relational models that are also compatible with predicate transformers and discusses how those models contribute to the understanding and application of nondeterministic choices in programming and proof tactic languages.
