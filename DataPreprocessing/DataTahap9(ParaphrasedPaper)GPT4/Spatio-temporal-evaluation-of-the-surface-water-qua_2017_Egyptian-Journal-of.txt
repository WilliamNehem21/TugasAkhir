This study examines the variation in surface water contamination within the Middle Nile Delta by assessing the algal pollution levels using the Palmer Index (PI). Seasonal water samples were collected during winter and summer from 18 sites that span across two main irrigation channels (the Qudaba and Mit-Yazed Canals) and two drainage systems (the El-Gharbia Main Drain and Janag Drain). Analysis of the algal content was performed according to the Palmer Index, which is based on specific algae species and genera known to indicate pollution levels.

The findings suggest a prevalent rise in Palmer Index values, especially during the summer, pointing to significant pollution sources. Fewer instances of lower PI scores indicated areas with cleaner water, which were not as common. During winter, both irrigation canals exhibited a pattern where PI values progressively rose towards the middle of the watercourses and then declined. In the summer, no consistent pattern was observed in the Qudaba Canal, whereas the PI scores in the Mit-Yazed Canals showed a decline towards the North. Seasonal contrasts were also present in the two drains, with the El-Gharbia Main Drain experiencing fluctuations in PI scores and the Janag Drain demonstrating the opposite trends to the El-Gharbia Main Drain.

The study further contextualizes the issue, acknowledging that organic pollution in the Nile is a major environmental concern exacerbated by human activities such as population growth and urban development, disrupting the water with organic waste from various sources.

Algae serve as an expedient indicator of water quality due to their sensitivity to changes in water properties, with algal communities swiftly reflecting shifts in conditions. The Palmer Index, developed based on the resilience of certain algae species to pollution and previously utilized in Egypt, provides a cost-effective and efficient method for assessing water pollution across multiple locations. Seasonal changes within the water bodies were also noted, with some algae indicating cleaner water in winter disappearing in the summer and the emergence of taxa associated with eutrophication and unpleasant odors in drinking water.

Overall, the Palmer Index effectively revealed the likelihood of water pollution in the Nile Delta's surface waters, with generational assessments proving more pertinent in drainage water cases. Pollution as measured by the Palmer Index varied across locations and seasons. Primarily, water in the Nile Delta displayed the effects of organic pollution at most sampling sites. In summer, the organic pollution burden was evidently higher due to increased water depth. The severity of contamination differed between the canals and drains, with urbanization influencing the levels in the Mit-Yazed Canal when compared to the Qudaba Canal, and the El-Gharbia Main Drain showing more pollution than the Janag Drain. As canal and drain waters are utilized for drinking, aquaculture, and irrigation, urgent steps for treatment and caution are recommended to mitigate the pollution's detrimental impacts.
