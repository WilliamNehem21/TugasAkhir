The paper discusses the development of a novel discrete model to understand processes in a context where multiple processes may occur concurrently. This new model is an extension of classic graph-based models where states are depicted as vertices and transitions as edges, which can either be directed or undirected.

Specifically, the model captures interactions between two processes, A and B, demonstrating the outcomes of sequential execution (A followed by B) as well as concurrent execution (A and B simultaneously). This is visualized through the concept of a triangle, where the boundary represents sequential executions and the interior represents intermediate states of concurrent executions. By adding another triangle, the model forms a simplicial complex that encapsulates all possible executions between A and B.

Additionally, the model uses a more sophisticated method, a simplicial category, where vertices are points within a simplicial set and transitions are represented by the simplicial set itself, allowing for the detection of higher-order structures not seen in simpler path categories. In this framework, calculation of the model involves examining 'necklaces' made up of simplices within the simplicial set representation.

This framework is mathematically underpinned by the concept of simplicial sets, which are defined as contravariant functors from a category of finite ordinals and order-preserving maps to the category of sets. These sets and their morphisms collectively form a category, with geometric realization serving as a functor that connects this category to the category of topological spaces.

The paper suggests that these simplicial set models are essentially triangulations of cubical set models. When creating models of execution spaces transitioning from one state to another, the use of simplicial necklaces is presented as a method, although the paper posits that using cubical necklaces could potentially offer a more efficient approach from a homotopy-theoretic perspective.
