The academic paper explains that identity functions maintain their r-continuity (or r-monotonicity) and when r-continuous (or r-monotone) functions are combined, the resulting function is also r-continuous (r-monotone). Two categories are defined: CRPOS, which consists of r-complete r-posets as objects and r-continuous functions as morphisms, and CRPOSR, which consists of r-complete r-posets that respect pre-orders in r when forming r-limits as objects and r-continuous functions as morphisms.
