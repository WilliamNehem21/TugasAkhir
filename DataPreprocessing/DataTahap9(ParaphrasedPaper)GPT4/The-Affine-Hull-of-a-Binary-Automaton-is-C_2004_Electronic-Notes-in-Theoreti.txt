The paraphrased version of the abstract might read as follows:

Section 2 of the paper provides a review of common notation, while section 3 discusses how the operations applied to affine spaces in this study are executable using only a Gaussian elimination algorithm. Section 4 introduces binary automata, and section 5 describes a method for determining the affine hull of vectors acknowledged by a binary automaton. In section 6, the authors demonstrate the utility of this affine hull in the calculation of place invariants for an effective counter system, introduced in that same section.

Remark 4.4 acknowledges that although vectors in Z^m can be expressed through a 2's complement representation to accommodate negative elements, this paper omits that detail for the sake of simplicity. However, it suggests that this inclusion would be straightforward, either by directly applying a 2's complement representation or observing that its application would be inherently similar.

In subsection 6.1, the paper provides proof that the affine hull of the reachability relation for a counter system can be calculated in polynomial time, relative to the affine hull of the reachability within a single step. This polynomial-time calculation is further elaborated on in subsection 6.2. The authors there elucidate the polynomial relationship between the affine hull of the reachability relation of a counter system and an enhanced version of place invariants. Finally, in subsection 6.3, the paper confirms that place invariants for an effective counter system are computable in polynomial time.
