The hepatitis C virus (HCV) is known for causing progressive liver disease, which can lead to chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis, and eventually hepatocellular carcinoma. Cytokeratin 18 (CK18) is a protein found in hepatocytes that becomes cleaved during liver damage. The M30 epitope of CK18 (CK18-M30) has a role in different apoptotic pathways. This study aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of CK18-M30 as a non-invasive marker for liver fibrosis evaluation and its correlation with the METAVIR score.

The study involved 168 patients with chronic hepatitis C (112 males and 56 females), and serum concentrations of CK18-M30 were measured using an ELISA technique. The results indicated that serum CK18 levels increase significantly with higher METAVIR fibrosis and inflammatory scores, with a strong correlation between CK18 levels and the stages of fibrosis (r = 0.881, p < 0.001) and levels of transaminases, which are liver enzymes (r = 0.355, p < 0.05). Additionally, there was a positive correlation between CK18 and viral load levels (r = 0.3, p < 0.05).

Thus, the study concluded that elevated serum levels of CK18-M30, reflecting increased apoptosis in hepatocytes, were associated with advanced liver fibrosis. The paper suggests that these markers could be useful as non-invasive indicators of liver damage in patients with chronic hepatitis C.

Mentioned in the context of this study are previous research by Akl et al., which found that increased CK18 expression is associated with higher stages of fibrosis in chronic HCV cases. Moreover, the study by Valva et al. is referenced, where serum apoptosis markers SFAS and M30 were found to indicate advanced fibrosis in both children and adults, with M30 also signaling severe steatosis in children. These findings outline the potential of CK18 as a valuable biomarker for liver damage assessment in the context of chronic hepatitis C infections.
