The abstract of an academic paper discusses the challenges shadows pose to computer vision tasks like object recognition and image segmentation. To address these issues, the paper presents a method for detecting shadows using a fuzzy split and merge approach based on the classical split and merge algorithm with an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). Unlike the classical method, which uses mean and standard deviation, the fuzzy predicate in the proposed method incorporates features like local maximum, entropy, and edge information to discern shadows. The process involves a top-down splitting of the image into homogeneous quadtree blocks and a bottom-up merging of adjacent regions, all governed by the trained fuzzy predicate. The proposed method is reportedly more accurate than previous shadow detection techniques.
