This academic paper introduces the concept of a Security Service Bus (SSB) as a novel approach to address the challenge of enforcing complex security policies across distributed and heterogeneous application components. Traditional security mechanisms often operate independently, making it difficult to implement policies that involve or depend on information across different system parts. The SSB acts as a dedicated communication pathway that allows security mechanisms to function as independent, reusable services linked to applications. This structure facilitates uniform access to application-level information, promoting more flexible, manageable, and expressive security policy enforcement.

The paper outlines the limitations of current methodologies where security mechanisms are either integrated into the middleware, blended into code using automata or aspect-oriented programming, or simply embedded within component code. To support this claim, the paper presents examples where policies require information not locally available at the enforcement point, necessitating a sophisticated approach to information sharing and policy execution.

A practical example is provided to demonstrate the necessity for an SSB, followed by a detailed explanation of its concept and operation. The SSB allows for uniform application-level information to be utilized by security services regardless of application-specific details. Application bindings consist of a wrapper component providing an abstract representation to the SSB. This abstraction includes both an enforcement interface, defining available actions and resources, and an information interface for invoking security service behavior.

The paper also discusses the concept of security events as triggers for security logic, the need for tight control of security information flow within domains, and how an SSB could simplify enforcement of information flow policies. Further, the paper reviews existing approaches to advanced security policy enforcement that incorporate additional attributes like time and application-level data, noting their limited application in distributed settings due to the lack of an effective communication channel.

The SSB is positioned as a generalized, inherently distributed version of existing flexible security frameworks, such as JAAS and JACC, which allow for third-party customizations. Alternative solutions for sharing security information are explored, including protocol-level propagation and attaching security metadata at lower levels than the protocols.

The paper concludes by emphasizing the SSB concept as a promising way to interconnect security services, and although it primarily discusses the theoretical aspects of an SSB, the authors plan to develop a detailed architecture and validate it through a prototype.
