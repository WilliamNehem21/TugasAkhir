This study examines eight widely-used digital rights management (DRM) products, assessing their functions and the impact on organizations through quantifiable metrics. DRM products aim to safeguard digital assets via encryption and central control, but implementation of these mechanisms can lead to reduced staff productivity. This impact is quantitatively measured using non-productive time (NPT) as part of stochastic modeling.

Gratitude is extended to Simon Parkin and Rouaa Yassin Kassab for their valuable input during research and writing, as well as to anonymous reviewers who enhanced the quality of this research through their critical assessments. Internal security threats, such as employee negligence, misuse of access rights, and insecure handling of confidential data, have been on the rise, prompting the development of DRM systems to address these security needs.

DRM technologies are designed to control access to digital content and can be categorized as commercial (used in music, film, and print industries) or enterprise (protecting organizational information). Despite the protection offered, there are concerns that DRM may negatively affect organizational efficiency, and this study evaluates whether the benefits of DRM outweigh the costs.

The study reviews eight DRM products from leading technology firms, exploring their administrative models, content management, user monitoring, and rights management. The research reveals how these products secure information through encryption and policy control, which can affect compliance with government regulations. However, the process of securing documents often hinders productivity due to time lost in authentication processes and seeking administrative assistance when access issues arise.

The study employs stochastic Petri nets and stochastic activity networks (SANs) to model and analyze the DRM-enabled processes within organizations. These models highlight how DRM implementations can cause NPT due to complexities in document access by authorized users.

In conclusion, while DRM products are essential for secure information management within organizations, it's crucial to consider their potential to decrease document availability and increase NPT for employees. This reduced operational efficiency highlights the need for a balanced approach when implementing DRM solutions.
