The paper discusses the solvability of nominal unification, a specific type of problem in computer science, and mentions that efficient algorithms exist to find solutions. These solutions include freshness contexts (which involve constraints indicating that a variable 'x' does not occur in a term 'a') and substitutions. It particularly focuses on nominal unification when concerning commutative functions, i.e., the 'nominal unification modulo commutativity (C)', where the commutative property needs consideration in the unification process.

The paper is structured as follows:

- Section 2 defines key terms and notations used throughout the paper.
- Section 3 expands on nominal C-unification with protected variables by adding new simplification rules, and adjusts the formal proofs for termination, soundness, and completeness of these rules.
- Section 4 describes a nominal C-matching algorithm and outlines the formal proof of its termination, soundness, and completeness.
- Section 5 provides a summary and conclusion of the findings.

Additionally, the paper makes a note that protected variables within a C-matching problem are defined as part of the parameters in the deductive system and remain constant during derivations. For ease of presentation, the paper denotes the set of protected variables as 'X'.
