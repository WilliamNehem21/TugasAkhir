In this research paper, the authors describe a method for determining the allocation of power usage and losses in an electrical grid, with the inclusion of Flexible AC Transmission Systems (FACTS) devices. They utilize a power flow tracing technique underpinned by graph theory, employing a modified version of the Kirchhoff matrix to help achieve this allocation. Specifically, the paper focuses on incorporating a type of FACTS device known as the Thyristor Controlled Series Capacitor (TCSC), which is modeled as a voltage source to evaluate its impact on the distribution of transmission usage and losses. The TCSC is typically employed for objectives such as reactive power compensation and voltage profile improvement. The authors demonstrate their method using a 5-bus test electrical system.

They apply and adjust an existing tracing algorithm to partition usage and losses. Additionally, the Newton-Raphson technique for calculating power flow is adapted to include the effects of the TCSC. The paper presents comparative results with and without the presence of the TCSC in the sample 5-bus system to show the differences in transmission usage and loss allocation caused by the FACTS device.
