Proof tasks in computer science, such as in program specification, transformation, and verification, usually don't require validity in all possible models but rather in specific ones. This paper offers an overview of inductive theorem proving (ITP) and its challenges, assuming the reader has a basic understanding of first-order logic. To fully comprehend the content, a certain familiarity with ITP theory and practice is beneficial, as the nuanced issues it presents are often underestimated. The paper provides an extensive list of references for those interested in delving deeper into the subject.

The paper acknowledges discussions in the literature on automated proof searching in theorem proving (TP) and ITP, pointing out the lack of attention to disproving conjectures in the automated reasoning community. Examples of forums where TP and ITP issues have been discussed include various workshops on strategies in automated deduction and the automation of inductive proof.

Most ITP approaches focus on universally quantified first-order formulas, while existential quantifiers add complexity to the process. Inductive conjectures involving existential quantifiers typically require constructing witnesses to satisfy the inductive property. Whether proofs are built with constructor or destructor functions, they can usually be translated between these frameworks, even though sticking to one is recommended from a proof-technical perspective.

The paper mentions the saturation process in ITP and references literature that has refined and improved earlier approaches. Debates around explicit versus implicit induction are noted, but as both present similar challenges in proof search, the paper does not delve into this distinction. Case analysis is highlighted as another complex ITP task, needing careful consideration regarding when to initiate it, how to generate cases, and how to ensure completeness.

The current state of the art in ITP is briefly discussed, providing insights from literature and personal experience, with the understanding that there's no concise consensus on these issues. The paper mentions several ITP systems: Agda, PVS, VSE/INKA, and Quodlibet, describing their focus areas and level of automation.

In summarizing, the paper emphasizes that automating ITP is more challenging than automating general TP due to specific difficulties in induction, hoping this discussion will lead to further debates and advancements in the field.
