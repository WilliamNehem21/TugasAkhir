In the context of the system described within the paper, channels can always be allocated as long as they are not currently in use. When a channel is first allocated, it is private. If a channel is sent, it becomes public, yet for communication to occur, it has to take place over a channel that is already public. Additionally, communication is only allowed over channels that have been allocated. When a channel that is not recognized locally is received, it is considered public because the environment recognizes it. If a channel that is locally recognized is received from the environment, then it cannot be private.
