In this paper, we examine a case study that serves to explain and support our methodology. The example involves a student who has just finished classes and is leaving the university building to find a way to get to a specific destination. In front of the university, there are different transportation options - a tram stop, a bus stop, and taxis. The student has the choice of taking either a bus, a tram, or a taxi, each with varying costs, leading to a prioritization with the bus being the preferred option, followed by the tram, and then the taxi. Both the bus and the tram operate on set schedules, which are regulated by their respective timekeepers. In this scenario, a bus, a tram, and two types of taxis (one hired and one available for hire) are included.

The correctness of processes in terms of their types is determined by a series of static typing rules. These rules define how a process behaves based on its types. A process that attempts to communicate via a channel without the necessary access can still be considered correct if there is an alternative, well-typed process, named the safety process.

We envision a vast network of interacting processes that create an "interaction field." This concept incorporates both action and reaction into the interaction field, where the emergence of new properties and non-linear effects are significant. Since accurately describing such an interaction field is challenging, we introduce the idea of "proximity," which illustrates that process interactions vary depending on the dynamic topology generated by the entire interaction field. An analogy is bird flocking behavior, which is shaped by the grouping and maneuvering of flocks.

Within the context of Timed Mobile Ambients (TMA), we define a "coordination pair" (t, cp). The 't' component assigns initial values to timers, storage capacities, and proximities. The 'cp' component consists of a rule set. In our example, timers regulate the interaction timing among components and control availability of resources. TMA offers a hierarchical space model which leads to a more accurate depiction of distributed computation and mobility. In TMA, the proximity function also influences component interactions, suggesting a fluid topology connected to the interaction field, thereby facilitating interactions between two processes in a broader context.
