Knowledge sharing remains a significant challenge in organizations. Even with advancements in semantic web technologies and human-machine interface research, which have improved access to information, there often remains a gap in providing contextually relevant information to meet specific user needs. Semantic web frameworks use domain ontologies to guide information access, which are essentially consensus-based concept definitions within a domain. However, each user usually has their personal conceptualization of that domain, differing from this consensus ontology.

The paper then presents a new approach to structuring project memory and capturing knowledge used and produced in design projects, detailed in Sections 2 and 3. Section 4 highlights the importance of context in information retrieval for design projects. Section 5 explores the use of conceptual graphs and RDF (Resource Description Framework) to represent project memory. Section 6 explains how CORESE, a search engine, uses the relationship between the conceptual graph and RDF representation for information retrieval.

The authors aim to provide intelligent access to knowledge stored in project memory, allowing for multiple perspectives in accessing it. They propose incorporating traceability into the project process to capture knowledge as it emerges, rather than after the project's completion.

Project memory structure facilitates discussion among team members by cataloging arguments, suggestions, and decisions, showing the progression of problem-solving. This structure also classifies contributions according to types, sources, and links to the competencies of the participant providing them, enhancing understanding of the problem-solving context.

Documents are indexed using metadata and keywords for simple retrievals, or through more complex semantic networks and ontologies suggested by the semantic web. Conceptual graphs are chosen as the representation method for the semantic network due to their structured approach to semantic relations between concepts and compatibility with RDF and XML.

Finally, the CORESE search engine, which uses RDF annotations to describe documents within corporate semantic webs, relies on the conceptual graphs model to leverage inference functions for information retrieval. It processes queries by mapping them between RDFS (RDF Schema) and conceptual graphs, allowing for sophisticated search capabilities.

The authors plan to further validate the system with additional design projects and hope to develop a graphical interface for displaying results. The ultimate goal is to use such an environment to aggregate components from similar design projects to create a comprehensive categorization of tasks, problems, and solutions that reflects the evolution of design strategies within a company.
