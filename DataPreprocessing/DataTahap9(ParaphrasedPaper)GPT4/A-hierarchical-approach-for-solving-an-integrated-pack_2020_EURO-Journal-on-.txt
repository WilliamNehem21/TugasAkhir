Glued laminated timber (Glulam) beams are manufactured by bonding together several thin wooden laminates of uniform thickness. The customization of beam sizes is achieved by adjusting the count and lengths of these laminates, with their width determining the final beam width. These laminates are first cut from logs, dried, and then inspected for quality. Finger-jointed extensions allow for the creation of exceptionally long laminates. The production process involves layering these laminates with adhesive in between, followed by pressing, which not only ensures perfect alignment but also activates the glue's curing process. Glulam production may sometimes entail using filler materials to adhere to press size limitations, which are later discarded as waste due to their small size.

Building on Ackermann and Dinges (2017), this paper introduces new algorithms for the Glulam production process and offers theoretical justifications for their effectiveness. The approach also draws upon methods used to tackle combinatorial optimization problems.

This study investigates how to optimally organize pieces into pressing sequences for both individual and combined orders (comprising up to three orders). Algorithmic solutions are provided, even as some problems within this realm are deemed NP-hard. Instead, heuristic methodologies are proposed to quickly generate practical results. The paper describes these heuristics and their effectiveness, highlighting their capacity to schedule several months' worth of production within minutes while minimizing waste and height variations in the press.

The work by Ackermann and Dinges (2017), which incorporates heuristics, surpasses expert human planning and has been successfully integrated with enterprise resource planning systems at sawmills. The algorithms have been improved in this study and are backed by theoretical analysis, including contributions from Diessel (2018).

Comparison with the work of Leoff (2016) demonstrates the advanced progress in this area of research. Additionally, connections to the two-dimensional variable-sized bin-packing problem investigated by Pisinger and Sigurd (2005) are noted, though their approach is less practical due to excessive computation times.

Methodologically, the treatment of single orders simplifies many constraints since all pieces in an order have the same height. The Largest Difference Method (LDM) is used to divide the pieces into appropriately sized layers, thus reducing the number of required height changes in the pressing sequences.

By strategically combining orders, the paper seeks to minimize waste. The algorithms tailored for this purpose take into account the cost and practical runtime, striking a balance between solution quality and computational efficiency. Overall, the proposed heuristics and algorithms carve out a new level of optimization for Glulam beam production planning, offering real-world practicality and improved performance over prior approaches.
