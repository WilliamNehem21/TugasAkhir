In this paper, we reveal the somewhat surprising connection between the widely recognized discounting approach used currently and Shapley's original conceptualization. We observe that present discounting methods unnecessarily limit the breadth of the conceptual framework. We propose removing these constraints to develop a more robust and inclusive theory that integrates both parity and mean payoff games as special cases within its limits.

The paper further discusses the 'uparity(p)' measure, which assigns a value of 0 or 1 based on whether the highest single-day payoff that recurs indefinitely has an odd or even parity. Despite several apparent similarities between mean payoff and parity games, particularly in deterministic scenarios, the precise relationship between these two game types remained a mystery. One reason for this ambiguity has been the lack of appropriate discounted models for parity games. Notably, mean payoff games can be approximated through the use of discounted games. Therefore, we suggest that without finding a discounted analog for parity games, any parallels drawn between parity and mean payoff games may be misleading or superficial.
