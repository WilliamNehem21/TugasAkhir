The academic paper investigates the influence of various parameters on the extraction yield of Terminalia catappa L. kernel oil (TCKO), with a view towards its potential industrial application as transformer oil. The research includes modeling the solvent extraction process using Response Surface Methodology (RSM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), alongside comprehensive analysis of the oil's physicochemical properties using standard testing protocols.

Gas chromatography (GC) and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy were utilized to identify the fatty acid composition and functional groups within the oil. Additionally, X-ray Diffraction (XRD) was employed to analyze the crystal structure of both the TCK and the residual material after oil extraction.

Commercial ANN software, incorporating Neural Network Toolbox of MATLAB R2017a, was deployed in the study. TCKO yield prediction utilized both Multilayer Full Feedforward (MFFF) and Multilayer Normal Feedforward (MNFF) neural networks, which were trained through Incremental Back Propagation (IBP). The optimal ANN structure featured an input layer with three neurons, a single-neuron output layer, and a hidden layer, with the specific details of the hidden layer and neurons being iteratively determined. Each ANN underwent 1000 training iterations. The ANN models were developed and tested using Central Composite Design (CCD) experimental data.

The efficiency of RSM and ANN as optimization methods was compared by analyzing experimentally derived responses against the predicted TCKO yields. The models were evaluated using coefficients of determination (R^2) and Root Mean Square (RMS) errors, which aimed to identify the most effective ANN model architecture. The RMS was also used to compare the predicted results from RSM and ANN against experimental outcomes.

The significance of the TCK oil extraction model was determined by assessing the p-value; a value less than 0.05 indicated strong evidence against the null hypothesis, thereby demonstrating the model's significance. The study observed variability in the fatty acid composition of TCKO when compared to previous research, which may be attributed to differences in geographical location and variety of TCK. As a result, the paper suggests that modification of TCKO is necessary to improve its saturation level before it can be used as transformer fluid.

The paper references several analytical standards and previous works, including ASTM D97 and D93, which cover methods for testing pour and flash points, and published works on the application of RSM in food science technology and the use of machine/statistical learning for environmental remediation.
