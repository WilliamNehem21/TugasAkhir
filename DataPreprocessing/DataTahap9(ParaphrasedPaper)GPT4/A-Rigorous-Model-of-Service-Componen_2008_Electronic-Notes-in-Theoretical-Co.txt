The paper addresses the issue of lacking a formal foundation in the Service Component Architecture (SCA) for specifying and verifying systems by introducing a formal service component signature model. Inspired by SCA's aim for independence, the paper proposes a language-independent model for specifying service component interface behaviors through port activities. This supports compatibility checks between components and translates Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) into dynamic behavior expressions and then into Petri nets for verification with existing tools. The paper presents this approach through a case study demonstrating the construction of a web application. It also discusses related work and future directions for this research field.
