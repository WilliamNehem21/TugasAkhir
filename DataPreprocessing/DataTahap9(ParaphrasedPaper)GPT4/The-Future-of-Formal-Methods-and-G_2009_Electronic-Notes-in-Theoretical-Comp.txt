Title: Re-emergence of Asynchronous Design in Semiconductor Industry: Perspectives and Predictions

Abstract:
Over the past 20 years, the dominance of synchronous (clocked) design in computer architecture and circuit design has overshadowed the once prevalent asynchronous methodologies. Despite their eclipse, such methodologies are poised for a resurgence due to their potential benefits in evolving technology landscapes. This paper reviews the state of asynchronous design and considers its future significance within the semiconductor industry.

Introduction:
The resurgence of asynchronous design, with handshake clocking methods poised to account for substantial portions of semiconductor designs by 2020, signals a major shift from clocked to asynchronous systems. The anticipated integration of asynchronous methods into 40% of designs suggests a transformative impact on circuit technology.

Asynchronous Design and Protocols:
The efficiency of handshake protocols in design and communication between modular asynchronous blocks is highlighted. For SRAM arrays and IP core interfacing, specific protocols like dual-rail with sense amplifiers and source synchronous protocols are employed, demonstrating their adaptability to various design and memory contexts.

Prediction and Evolution of Asynchronous Design:
Forecasting technology trends is challenging, yet emerging transistor technologies may either enhance or render current predictions obsolete. One key prediction is the transition of formal verification from a niche to a fundamental aspect of the design process. This shift, driven by the need to address concurrent systems' complexities, will lead to pain and cost for the industry, yet result in improved productivity and fewer product recalls.

Modular Design and Interface Protocols:
The increasing modularity of designs necessitates formal protocol verification to facilitate efficient inter-block communication. Handshake protocols vary in complexity, and their correct temporal modeling is becoming essential.

Formal Verification Advances:
The development of relative timing in formal verification methods is highlighted, with new approaches being explored to achieve system-level correctness. The proper balance between proving design correctness and optimizing timing will become critical in next-generation systems.

Industry Impact of Formal Verification:
Formal verification's growing prominence will ensure the reliability of complex systems, foster the transition to asynchronous design, and potentially improve specifications. However, reaching a consensus on formal specification representations presents a challenge.

Adoption of Asynchronous Design:
Predicted to begin at the low-performance end, asynchronous design adoption will eventually encompass the entire spectrum. Successful startups, such as Handshake Solutions, exemplify this progressive adoption.

Integration in Clocked Design:
The seamless integration of asynchronous blocks in clocked designs, such as SRAM arrays, suggests a latent acceptance of the methodology. The potential decoupling of design correctness from timing performance holds promise for adopting asynchronous methods in mainstream design processes.

Predictions on the Semiconductor Industry by 2020:
The paper anticipates a shift in IP core design, the development of advanced optimization techniques that were previously infeasible, and the decline of traditional register arrays in favor of data validity-based designs. As the industry converges towards a blend of the best aspects of both clocked and asynchronous designs, the implementation of delay insensitive (DI) design methodologies is expected to spread widely.

Commercialization and CAD Tool Development:
The diversity of asynchronous designs poses an obstacle to unification, while the need for custom CAD tools for asynchronous design is another challenge. Closer integration between asynchronous and clocked design is expected to leverage commercial clocked CAD engines for timing purposes.

Asynchronous Design Flow and Programming:
The asynchronous design flow is anticipated to adjust to include the design and verification of asynchronous templates. This change will necessitate new programming languages and optimization strategies focused on communication channels, paving the way for future communication-centric chip design methodologies.

Conclusion:
The paper presents a bold vision for the resurgence of asynchronous design methodologies, emphasizing the critical role of formal verification, the potential for design optimization, and the anticipated evolution of design practices and tools in the semiconductor industry by 2020.
