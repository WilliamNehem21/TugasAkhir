This paper discusses strategies to ensure that recompiling applications for new architectures is cost-effective, which generally requires reliable systems, compilers, and consistently measurable performance improvements. Techniques for source code evaluation and compiler validation during standard software testing are outlined, alongside more robust self-validation methods for compilers, aiming to decrease debugging efforts and enhance recompilation cost efficiency.

The paper includes the following sections:

1. Introduction (summarized above).
2. An overview of the Register Stack Engine (RSE) and speculation in Itanium processors.
3. Descriptions of common software errors such as parameter mismatches and how the compiler can detect them.
4. The introduction of compiler techniques to avoid 'not a thing' (NaT) consumption faults caused by uninitialized registers or automatic variables.
5. Examples of speculation and recovery code, with compiler aid in assessing their correctness.
6. Conclusions summarizing the paper's content.

The paper then covers compiler validation algorithms to prevent NaT consumption faults by detecting potentially uninitialized registers, utilizing both conservative compile-time analysis and run-time instrumentation methods. Techniques for ensuring correct speculative execution and recovery code are also discussed, with potential pitfalls in compiler-generated recovery code highlighted and solutions for preventing these issues provided. These methods and tools, while general in nature, are also tailored for the Itanium architecture and address problems like parameter mismatches and missing 'volatile' keyword declarations.
