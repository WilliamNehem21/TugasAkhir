This academic paper analyzes a malware distribution network (MDN), a network made up of connected domain names that spread malicious software globally to compromise systems. The authors conducted a detailed analysis of these networks over time, focusing on clusters of connected domain names that they refer to as malicious clusters (M-clusters). They examined domain names at the second and top-level, such as example.com, and created a unique dataset spanning from January 19 to September 25, 2017. Through data collected from Google Safe Browsing and other sources, they observed persistent and large clusters which maintain their structure over time, contrary to the belief that such structures are short-lived. This discovery suggests that malicious actors are actively working to maintain these distribution networks for the long haul, which has implications for how cyber defenses might monitor and tackle these networks.

The paper emphasizes that this research could only uncover these insights through temporal analysis rather than static analysis approaches. The authors claim that their study contributes new knowledge to the current literature by offering insights into the temporal evolution of domain name structures that host and transmit malware. They were able to attribute active distribution phases and structural changes within subnetworks, enhancing understanding of MDN operations and infrastructure.

The MDN in question was built from a novel dataset collected over eight months in 2017, obtained by merging data from Google Safe Browsing and VirusTotal. The data provided a real-time representation of ongoing malicious events rather than relying on past occurrences or synthetic data. This allowed for a temporal analysis that shed light on active distribution and hosting of malware, revealing the MDN's operational characteristics and how it changed over time.

The authors found that the MDN consisted of several isolated clusters and that bridges and hubs within these clusters are critical for distributing malicious traffic. By taking down these nodes, large sections of an MDN could be disabled. However, cluster survivability could be increased if multiple clusters are utilized. The majority of malware found in the study were HTML pages with embedded JavaScript, often used for automated downloads or installations of other malware, or pages that engaged in social engineering.

Finally, the paper highlights that while the research is based on publicly available data, which may represent only a fraction of the full scope of malicious activity, the findings remain valid and significant. The authors encourage further research using the data they have made publicly available and plan to continue enriching their dataset and exploring new ways to utilize it in combating malware distribution.
