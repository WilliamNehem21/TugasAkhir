In this article, the authors introduce a program transformation algorithm known as distillation, which is an improvement over traditional unfold/fold techniques like supercompilation, and is capable of achieving more than linear speedup in program performance. Distillation not only optimizes programs by transforming them into a version that utilizes tail recursion and minimizes the creation of intermediate structures, but also simplifies the verification of program properties. This is achieved through the resulting programs' suitability for automatic verification with inductive proof rules.

The paper describes how distillation leads to a specialized program form that is convenient for applying these proof rules, hence supporting the argument for incorporating the distillation algorithm directly into compilers. Doing so would enhance compilers with the dual capability of optimizing programs and verifying their correctness with relative ease.

Furthermore, the paper discusses the technical structure of distillation, such as dealing with potential non-termination issues by generalizing expressions when embeddings of previously encountered terms are detected. It also covers rewrite rules for generalization and a procedure for automatic proof generation that relies on these rewrite rules. While noting the possibility of overgeneralization, which might falsely identify a correct program as incorrect, the authors affirm that when their theorem prover asserts a program's correctness, it is indeed accurate.

In conclusion, the authors propose that the distillation algorithm significantly advances existing transformation techniques by offering both enhanced optimization and the straightforward verification of programs, making it a valuable addition to compiler design.
