This paper presents an access control method designed for Internet of Vehicles (IoV), a dynamic network where vehicles continuously change locations and interact with various nodes, including other vehicles and roadside units (RSUs). Amidst growing vehicle populations, it's crucial to authenticate these nodes to maintain network integrity and protect against malicious entities.

The proposed solution involves mutual authentication, wherein legitimately participating vehicles compute secret session keys that are based on cryptographic techniques and pre-shared information. These keys ensure future secure communication between vehicles in a cluster.

The authors have conducted both informal and formal security analyses, including the use of the AVISPA tool, demonstrating that their access control scheme can defend against various attacks. They also show the scheme's efficiency by comparing computational and communication costs with existing methods, claiming it outperforms most other schemes.

Additionally, the proposed scheme includes a password update phase for vehicles, enhancing security by allowing the modification of compromised passwords.
