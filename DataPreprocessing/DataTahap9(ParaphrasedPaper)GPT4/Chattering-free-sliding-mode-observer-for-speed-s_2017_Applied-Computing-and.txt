The paper describes an expert-engineered navigation approach that ensures dynamic stability and appropriate response by using a fuzzy logic system (FLS). The FLS's output, which directly influences the sliding function (FS) to maintain the observer's stability, is determined through a singleton fuzzification method, center-average defuzzification, and product inference, tailored to each set of input values.

Additionally, the research includes an investigation into the observer's reliability under increased electrical resistance conditions within the motor, which would typically lead to higher core and copper losses, and intensified mechanical frictions. The study assesses this by artificially doubling the motor resistance through the introduction of an extra resistor in series with the stator winding and then evaluating the system's performance by applying a sudden speed change from 400 to 4000 revolutions per minute (rpm).
