In this paper, we put forward a framework for an advanced recommender system, termed an intelligent recommender system (IRS), which enhances the scope of traditional knowledge-based recommender systems. IRS is characterized by its ability to utilize knowledge, engage in learning, uncover new insights, and deduce user preferences and criticisms, among other functionalities. The framework comprises multiple components: a knowledge representation paradigm, learning strategies, and reasoning mechanisms. Furthermore, it incorporates five distinct knowledge models, which encompass various aspects relevant to making recommendations, including users, items, domain, context, and criticisms.

We demonstrate the application of this IRS framework through the use of Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs). The performance of the IRS is then rigorously evaluated against specialized criteria related to knowledge utilization, with the aim of assessing the system's adaptability and efficiency.

The paper goes on to discuss various recommendation techniques stemming from fields like artificial intelligence, data mining, and information retrieval. However, traditional knowledge-based systems only utilize knowledge in a basic manner. We argue that an IRS, which is grounded in learning algorithms, knowledge representation, and reasoning engines, can fully leverage knowledge, continuously update it, and deduce further insights.

This work begins with a background on recommender systems, followed by a theoretical foundation for our approach, the IRS framework, and a detailed view of its knowledge models. We present an IRS implementation using FCMs and describe a case study involving the FCMs-based IRS. Subsequent sections offer an analysis of the experimental results.

The IRS exploits a comprehensive knowledge base, incorporating extended user and item profiles, as well as domain and critical knowledge. It can be implemented using various intelligent techniques, and the paper includes an example using FCMs informed by expert opinions and historical data. The paper compares the IRS with other knowledge-based systems and concludes that the IRS's unique mix of knowledge representation, learning, and reasoning enhances the recommendation process.

Our IRS framework aims to provide a more effective recommender system compared to existing approaches, with the adaptability to use standard user and item profile information such as the IMS standard in education. The comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that our IRS effectively utilizes knowledge, convincing users and enabling high-quality decision-making based on the system's recommendations.
