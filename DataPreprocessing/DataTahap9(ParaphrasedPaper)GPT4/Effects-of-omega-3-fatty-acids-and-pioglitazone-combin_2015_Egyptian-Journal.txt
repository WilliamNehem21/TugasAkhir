The prevalence of diabetes is rapidly increasing worldwide, with the Middle East and North Africa region seeing particularly high rates; around 10% of adults have diabetes, and Egypt is among the top ten countries in terms of diabetes prevalence with 7.5 million cases reported in 2013. This number is projected to reach 13.1 million by 2035. Diabetes is primarily characterized by prolonged high blood sugar levels.

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) makes up the majority of diabetes cases and is often associated with modifiable social and lifestyle factors, emphasizing the importance of lifestyle changes alongside medical intervention. Obesity plays a critical role by increasing fatty tissue mass, which in turn leads to insulin resistance in fat, muscle, and liver tissues.

Omega-3 fatty acids, like eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have been demonstrated in animal studies to prevent the development of insulin resistance, obesity, and lipid imbalances. These fatty acids appear to work through interactions with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-α), which is involved in fat cell differentiation and metabolism of fats and carbohydrates.

Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a hormone that plays a significant role in regulating glucose and lipid levels. It is derived from a larger precursor protein and operates as a true hormone, acting upon binding to its receptors (FGFRs) and the cofactor β-Klotho. FGF21 is involved in multiple metabolic processes, including stimulating glucose uptake in adipocytes, influencing glucagon metabolism, thus reducing liver glucose production, and enhancing liver glycogen synthesis. It is also implicated in the preservation of β-cell function and survival.

In an experiment, rats were given a high-fat diet and then injected with streptozotocin (STZ) to induce diabetes. Diabetic rats were then analyzed for blood glucose levels and only considered diabetic if persistent hyperglycemia was present. RNA from these rats was extracted, converted to cDNA, and studied for gene expression correlations with various physiological markers.

Omega-3 fatty acids were found to lower fasting blood glucose and have a strong effect on reducing triglyceride levels, possibly through increasing glycogen synthesis, enhancing fat breakdown, and reducing triglyceride synthesis, partially mediated by PPAR-α. Pioglitazone, another drug, also significantly lowered cholesterol and triglycerides by affecting lipid metabolism processes.

Animal studies suggest that FGF21 has positive effects on metabolism, possibly reversing metabolic disorders in obese and diabetic subjects. Elevated levels of FGF21 in the blood may indicate a compensatory response to insulin resistance. PPAR is considered a key regulator of FGF21, and pioglitazone has been shown to increase hepatic FGF21 mRNA expression.

Correlations between circulating FGF21 levels and various metabolic parameters have been observed, including fasting blood glucose, insulin resistance, serum cholesterol, and triglyceride levels. These findings are consistent with other studies that established similar associations.

Research has indicated that omega-3 fatty acid therapy can significantly reduce triglycerides and potentially improve endothelial function but may not substantially enhance insulin sensitivity in patients with elevated triglyceride levels. Another study found a novel insulin sensitizer that acts as a coligand for both PPAR-α and PPAR-γ and improved lipid metabolism in Zucker fatty rats.

Elevated serum FGF21 has been linked to T2D and the presence of carotid artery plaques. A different study showed that the drug exenatide reduced FGF21 resistance in the liver in the context of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease related to obesity.
