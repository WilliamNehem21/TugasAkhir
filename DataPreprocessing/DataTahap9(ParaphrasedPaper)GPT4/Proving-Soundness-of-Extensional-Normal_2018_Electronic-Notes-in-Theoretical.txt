The authors indicate that the detailed proof of Theorem 3.8 is available in their Coq formalization but provide a brief overview of key compatibility proofs to illustrate how proofs are structured within their system. Specifically, they discuss the 'app' case, highlighting the necessity of distinguishing between active and passive tests. 

They contrast their proof strategy with that of another approach that would rely on induction based on the closure's definition as given in Definition 3.1. The authors point out that with their small-step semantic definition, they avoid the need for induction over the number of evaluation steps. However, they do acknowledge that a big-step semantics would encounter similar challenges that would require a nested inductive proof. 

For the 'up-to' techniques of 'lam,' 'refl,' and 'red,' they mention these are straightforward to handle and provide a more in-depth look at the proof related to the 'lam' technique.
