The Petri Net Baukasten is a conceptual framework organized into three distinct perspectives: the Application Developer View, the Expert View, and the Tool Developer View. These views are united by a shared foundation called the Common Base, which is a taxonomy of Petri Net concepts that remains consistent regardless of their specific application, theoretical formalization, or tool support implementation.

To use the Petri Net Baukasten practically, one must instantiate it, which involves specifying its content and technical requirements. The initial implementation documented only provides minimal features without interactive or dynamically updatable elements. Users are expected to cooperate to enhance the database, maintaining ties between different perspectives when adding new information.

The paper outlines the structure of employing the Petri Net Baukasten as follows:

1. Section 2 revisits the goals and structure of the framework and introduces a second iteration.
2. Sections 3 to 5 delineate components such as user interfaces, services, and database specifics.
3. Section 6 suggests a software architecture incorporating these elements, adding essential functionalities for software realization.
4. Section 7 presents a user scenario illustrating the benefits of the second iteration setup.

The primary goal of the Petri Net Baukasten is to provide tailored support for various users in specific application domains where Petri Nets aid system development across fields like production automation and workflow management.

A Petri Net type includes a semi-formal description, which includes basic elements (places, transitions, markings) and available operations for analysis or structuring. Formal descriptions of these types reside in the Expert View, where each characteristic is mathematically formalized.
  
The dynamic database of the second iteration grows over time and is structured per the framework's concept, containing specific data for different user groups and the overarching Common Base.

Services run on this database and are differentiated by target user group, including search services that query the database and maintenance services that modify it and facilitate asynchronous cooperation among users.

User interfaces serve as entry points for different user roles, offering relevant services for information retrieval about Petri Nets, leading to an efficient user-centered experience.

Effective collaboration among users is key to bridging the gap between the various perspectives on Petri Nets, allowing for the discussion of open problems and joint research initiatives across user groups. 

The paper thus lays out a roadmap for the development and application of the Petri Net Baukasten, emphasizing the need for user cooperation in evolving the framework and maintaining alignment between the theoretical, practical, and developmental facets of Petri Nets.
