Mobile identity management is often viewed as a subset of identity management, a perspective that holds partial truth. The introduction of new context data, particularly location data, presents unique challenges, making some traditional identity management approaches less effective in a mobile context. This paper examines the privacy concerns related to mobile identity management, using the example of a “friend finder” application, which operates on push context-aware technology. While the issues discussed are not exclusive to mobile identity management, they require a more mobile-centric approach to evaluation.

The "friend finder" application functions by having mobile users periodically transmit their location data, computed by their mobile devices, to a central location provider. These users can then request the whereabouts of their friends and relatives through the provider, who typically presents this information in text form. A map provider can enhance this service by displaying the locations on a map with navigation directions.

Mobile identity management serves to protect users' personal data, similar to how individuals normally protect their identity in real life. A person possesses multiple partial identities, each associated with a distinct set of social roles or relationships, like being a computer scientist, spouse, child, or friend. Each of these partial identities comprises various attributes. People intuitively select which partial identity to present in different interactions and have the ability to change between these identities swiftly. Similarly, in the digital realm, users ought to have the capability to create and manage different partial identities, attribute groups to each identity, and control their disclosure based on the interaction's context.

The paper also reviews a demo application that safeguards user privacy and pseudonymity from mobile operators and service providers, focusing on pull services rather than the push services central to this investigation. The demo doesn't address context relationships and dependencies or the concept of varying degrees of detail, known as blurring in levels.

The FIDIS (Future of Identity in the Information Society) project, funded by the European Union’s Sixth Framework Programme for research and technological development, explores topics such as future identity management, identity theft, privacy in legal and social contexts, and the intersection of mobility and identity.

Blurring levels is a method of providing varying precision in location data; for outdoors, this could include GPS coordinates, street name, or broader geographic regions, while indoor blurring could entail room number and building name. Blurring can improve service by allowing users to choose the degree of location detail they share, which affects how services are delivered, such as directions to nearby restaurants.

The paper highlights the limitations of APPEL as a privacy preference language for identity management, suggesting that a more robust language must account for various static and dynamic context data, their interdependencies, and blurring levels.

Post data release to a service provider, users typically lose control over their data's usage, making trust essential. P3P enables the establishment of such trust by detailing a provider's data handling policies, while APPEL allows users to compare policies against their preferences. However, P3P cannot guarantee policy enforcement.

The stakes of mobile data confidentiality are rising with the growing prevalence of mobile devices. The theft or loss of unencrypted devices places personal data at risk.

Lastly, users need to be aware of potential data misuse and establish the preference parameters and context rules that will guide how their location data is shared. Service providers should respect these preferences and policies before disseminating information, and anonymity networks can further protect users' identities during direct interactions with providers such as map services.
