Carbone and Maffeis initially introduced matching systems to explore the capabilities of the pi-calculus with regards to polyadic synchronization. In this paper, we extend their work to analyze matching systems in the context of CCS, the pi-calculus, and mobile ambients. We particularly demonstrate that under certain criteria, it's not possible to represent the asynchronous pi-calculus with matching within CCS that supports polyadic synchronization of unlimited arity.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides definitions for the computational models we will examine. Sections 3 and 4 are dedicated to studying weak and strong matching systems correspondingly. We conclude the paper with a summary and discussion of potential avenues for future research.

Moreover, we challenge the possibility that CCS_n can have a weak matching system of degree n+1, using Lemma 3.2. Assuming that such a system does exist leads to a contradiction, as it can produce false-positive matches where none actually occur.

Our findings confirm that the mobile ambients calculus can support weak matching systems of any finite degree. However, it does not support replicated strong matching systems of degree two or beyond. The investigation leaves open the question of whether there can be a strong matching system of degree two or higher in mobile ambients, although we speculate that this is unlikely.
