In the realm of verification, it is common to describe verification conditions within a system that allows for multiple sorts of objects. The Nelson-Oppen method, a classic method for combining decision procedures for different theories, has recently been adapted to work within a sorted framework, acknowledging the presence of different, non-overlapping sorts.

The paper discusses the concept of an "interpretation theory" (or i-theory), which is a set of interpretations for a union of languages that do not share common sorts. An i-theory for the combined language can be seen as the combination of i-theories for each individual language, with the restriction that interpretations are confined to their respective languages.

To define how i-theories combine, the paper introduces a theorem. It states that in order to combine two i-theories from disjoint languages, one of the i-theories for each sort must be "flexible." When combining the theories, a set of literals (basic statements that can be true or false) are separated based on the languages they pertain to, and care must be taken to address variables common to both languages.

The paper also mentions the concept of an "uninterpreted i-theory," where no specific interpretation is given to constants, predicates, and functions. This kind of i-theory doesn't impose constraints on the domains over which they are defined, and it is useful because it allows new uninterpreted symbols to be added to the language of a decidable i-theory.

Furthermore, the paper notes that sorts could be "merged" in practice, such as arrays being considered distinct from elements and indices, but opens the possibility for these sorts to be considered in common in certain practical situations.

Addressing improvements over classical approaches, the updated Nelson-Oppen scheme is versatile because it deals with arbitrary sets of interpretations rather than strictly first-order theories. This allows the scheme to encompass a wider variety of i-theories, such as linear arithmetic, arithmetic on finite domains, and others relevant to parameterized system verification.

Lastly, the paper mentions improvements in combining i-theories that are not "stably infinite" within a many-sorted framework. This refers to the combination of i-theories that cannot be assumed to have infinite domains, which was an issue in the classic Nelson-Oppen method. The new scheme allows for these combinations, thus enhancing the applicability of the method in verification contexts.
