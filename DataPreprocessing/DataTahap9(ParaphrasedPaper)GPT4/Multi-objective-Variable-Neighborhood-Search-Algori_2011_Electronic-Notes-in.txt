A Multi-Objective Variable Neighborhood Search (MOVNS) algorithm, referenced in academic studies, has undergone performance evaluations through computational testing on medium to large problem instances. The findings indicate these proposed algorithms surpass the original MOVNS in terms of generating high-quality solutions. Moreover, a statistical examination of the performance has been conducted for these new methodologies.

The realm of Single Machine Scheduling Problems (SMSP) has seen significant research that typically focuses on one optimization criterion. However, real-world scenarios often present decision-makers with multiple, sometimes conflicting objectives, such as minimizing the maximum completion time (makespan), total production or flow time, and overall tardiness, all of which have practical importance for operational efficiency.

Historically, single-objective approaches have dominated research on SMSPs with earliness and tardiness penalties, with some authors considering different or common due dates. Lee and Choi, for instance, considered distinct due dates, proposing an optimal polynomial-time algorithm used alongside a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to optimize completion times. The current body of literature also shows hybrid heuristics, combining local search methods and GAs, to tackle this scheduling issue.

Addressing multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems often utilizes metaheuristics, which were initially designed for single-objective pursuits. Their success in a range of applications has spurred extensions into multi-objective optimization. However, applications of the VNS metaheuristic to multi-objective optimization are rare. To our knowledge, Geiger was the first to introduce an MOVNS, applying it to various multi-objective problems.

Our contribution includes two VNS-based algorithms to solve bi-objective SMSP, improving upon Geiger's MOVNS. These algorithms feature an intensification process that relies on constructing Pareto-efficient partial solutions instead of full solution evaluations in existing neighborhoods. Simulation results support the superiority of our algorithms in effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness.

This paper details the multi-objective problem in Section 2 and elaborates on the MOVNS algorithms in Section 3. Section 4 presents computational experiment results, confirming the performance merit of the proposed algorithms. We introduce an intensification phase for MOVNS1, entailing the construction of new solutions from non-dominated neighbor solutions using scalarizing functions and Pareto dominance.

We initiate our MOVNS algorithms with a base solution from a set of non-dominated solutions (D), marking and excluding visited ones. If all solutions are visited, the process restarts. Two distinct intensification approaches are proposed: a weighted utility function optimization (Intensification1) and a Pareto dominance-based method (Intensification2).

Implemented in C++ and tested on an Intel Core Quad with ample processing power and memory, the algorithms operated under CPU time-based stopping criteria, proportionate to instance size. We determined the optimal parameter (d) for Intensification through experimentation, selecting d=6 for the best performance.

To gauge algorithm performance, a reference set (REF) comprising all non-dominated solutions from the three algorithms serves as the comparative standard, employing several performance metrics.

In conclusion, we have effectively applied Geiger's MOVNS to the SMSP with distinct due windows, minimizing both earliness/tardiness penalties and total flow time, enhancing solution quality significantly with new algorithm versions MOVNS2 and MOVNS3 and their intensification procedures.
