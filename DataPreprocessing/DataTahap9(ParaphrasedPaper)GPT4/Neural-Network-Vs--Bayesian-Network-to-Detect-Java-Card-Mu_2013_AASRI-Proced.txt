Smart cards, integral to communications, authentication, and payment systems, are susceptible to fraudulent attacks aimed at accessing their services. These attacks, including sophisticated software and hardware types, have recently focused on fault injection, altering the card's application behavior by disrupting Java Card operations and modifying the compiled code to fulfill the attacker's objectives instead of executing the intended program. To address this challenge, two AI-based classification and detection methods, utilizing neural networks and Bayesian networks, are proposed and compared in terms of their detection rates.

Smart cards, containing a chip operating system in ROM and applications in EEPROM, act as secure data carriers, emphasizing data integrity and confidentiality during transactions. Protection against fault injections, which are used to extract secret data by introducing errors into the system to study its behavior and manipulate execution, is a key concern in smart card development. Manufacturers incorporate new countermeasures into their operating systems to prevent and detect such attacks.

These cards operate on a global scale, where digital security is paramount. The Java Card architecture, embedded with computing and memory constraints, consists of several layers, including the Java Card Runtime Environment (JCVM) and API. The JCVM, analogous to an abstract processor, along with the security firewall and mechanisms from standard Java, helps enforce system security. Certain components, like the Byte Code Verifier (BCV), must operate on external platforms due to memory restrictions. Smart cards are particularly vulnerable to hardware attacks because of their sensitive data and robustness.

Fault attacks, conceptualized by Boneh, DeMillo, and Lipton, aim to produce errors by disrupting the processor's physical environment, initially targeting cryptographic algorithms like RSA and DES. To counter these attacks, neural networks with capabilities in learning, object identification, and interpretation are proposed for integration into smart cards. An intelligent network capable of detecting faults, fueled by the card's physical parameters, was designed to recognize changes in electrical properties. However, since these parameters can be manipulated by attackers, alternative network entry points must be considered.

Testing the network's effectiveness involves introducing new attack patterns. If the neural network mostly returns expected values, it's deemed capable of attack detection. For example, one implementation success involved the network detecting 126 out of 131 invalid paths without raising false alarms on 7 valid paths during the testing of a debit function.
