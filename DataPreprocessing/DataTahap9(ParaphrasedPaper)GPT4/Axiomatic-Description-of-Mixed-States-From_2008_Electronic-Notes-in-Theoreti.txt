This paper's research is financially supported by the EPSRC Advanced Research Fellowship (EP/D072786/1), focusing on the structure of quantum information and its implications for information technology, and the EPSRC grant (EP/C500032/1), which deals with high-level methods in quantum computation and quantum information. The inspiration for the study partly came from discussions with Yannick Delbecque, Dan Gottesman, and Jon Yard during a workshop at the Perimeter Institute in July 2005. It was also influenced by a collaboration with Keye Martin on domain theory, and Peter Selinger provided constructive criticism on an earlier draft of the paper.

The goal of the research is to methodically study the important quantitative concepts of quantum information theory using qualitative approaches and to integrate them into a cohesive theory. The authors are optimistic that this approach will lead to new fundamental and integrative concepts within the field. Although the work is ongoing and not entirely represented in the paper, the authors anticipate the development of a comprehensive, compositional theory on quantum informatics resources. Such a theory would significantly build upon recent theories proposed by Devetak, Harrow, and Winter.
