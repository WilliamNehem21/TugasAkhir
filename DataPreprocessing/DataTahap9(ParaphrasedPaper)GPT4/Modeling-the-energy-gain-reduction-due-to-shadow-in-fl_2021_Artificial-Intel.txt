This excerpt from an academic paper discusses the optimization of flat-plate solar collectors and the application of artificial intelligence to model heat transfer and performance in solar energy systems.

It starts by mentioning that flat-plate solar collectors often use one or two layers of glass above the absorber plate to minimize convective losses, as stated by Duffie and Beckman in 2013. However, Farhadi and Taki in 2020 noted that if the glass is positioned too far from the absorber plate, it can cast shadows, decreasing the collector's efficiency. Optimal glass spacing is debated, with some research, including Nahar and Garg in 1980, recommending a distance of 4 to 5 centimeters. Farhadi and Taki have previously established a method for estimating the impact of shadows on energy performance.

The passage goes on to describe artificial intelligence methods used to model solar energy systems. Ghritlahre and Prasad in 2018 developed multiple linear regression (MLR) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) models to predict heat transfer in roughened solar air heaters, finding the ANN model with a 5-10-1 layout to be highly accurate, with a correlation coefficient of 0.9953, superior to MLR. Similarly, an ANN-MLP model effectively predicted the performance of a solar chimney equipped with phase change materials, demonstrating predictions with over 0.99 correlation and less than 3% relative error.
