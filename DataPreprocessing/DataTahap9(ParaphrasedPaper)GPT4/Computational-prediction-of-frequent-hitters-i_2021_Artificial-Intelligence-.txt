The paper discusses the pivotal role of high-throughput screening (HTS) technologies in drug discovery, focusing on the challenge of identifying false-positive results due to assay interference. The sources of such interference include the formation of colloidal aggregates by small molecules and chemical reactivity of compounds with biomacromolecules or screening technology components.

Several computational methods were highlighted for predicting the likelihood of small molecules to form colloidal aggregates. These include Aggregator Advisor, which identifies potential aggregators through molecular similarity to a database of known aggregators, ChemAgg, which relies on a XGBoost model, and SCAM Detective, which employs random forest models.

In addressing the chemical reactivity that leads to assay interference, computational strategies mainly involve rules that detect substructures associated with reactivity. The paper further discusses assay datasets with high hit rates, specifically noting that the top six assays were related to cytochrome P450 enzyme activity, and it distinguishes specific bioactivity assays from cytotoxicity assays.

Additionally, the paper lays out steps taken to ensure prediction consistency in creating training sets for machine learning models, such as the strategic removal of compounds with identical molecular fingerprints but different labels.

Differences in model performance based on the type of assay data were analyzed, showing that distinct models should be created for target-based and cell-based assays. The study used a combination of different training sets, machine learning algorithms, and classification types to build 24 predictive models. An evident decrease in performance by KNN classifiers on test sets suggested possible overfitting.

When tested on a new dataset, the MLP models demonstrated high specificity in classifying compounds, supporting the validity of these models. Across various classifiers, it was determined that MLP models generally offered the best performance and robustness. The paper also notes that adjusting classification decision thresholds can accommodate different model sensitivity and specificity requirements.

The paper cites a reference regarding interferences with luciferase reporter enzymes as a particular example of assay interference. This reference is part of the Assay Guidance Manual by Auld and Inglese (2016), providing context for the types of challenges faced in HTS assays.
