This paper introduces a rule format for structural operational semantics (SOS) that ensures certain constants operate as left or right zero elements within a set of binary operators. It refines an earlier rule format developed by the authors for unit elements. The paper illustrates how to verify left and right zero elements, along with unit elements, from existing literature using these rule formats.

The paper focuses on semantic properties such as commutativity, associativity, and idempotence within structural operational semantics. It advocates for rule formats as they permit verification of these properties through syntactic checks, which can be automated. Such results are significant as they can be applied to a wide range of languages.

The zero-element rule format is established in the context of GSOS (Generalised Structural Operational Semantics) languages, taking advantage of transition formulae logic developed by the authors for reasoning about GSOS rule premises. This paper also mentions an approach for zero-element rule formats applicable beyond GSOS languages, provided in the full version of the paper.

The paper revisits definitions from SOS theory and logic of initial transitions before presenting the formats for left/right zero elements and unit elements. It concludes with a summary of the key findings and points to the extended results available in the full paper version.

The paper's methods enable simplification, such as checking only specific substitutions when establishing semantic entailment. The conditions detailed demonstrate how to identify the relevant constants and rules when determining if an element is a zero or unit element.

Examples are provided to illustrate how the constants with no transition rules act as left and right zero elements and how certain conditions must be met for a theorem to hold, with the proof of each closed term as a left unit element for a binary operator.

Additionally, the full version of the paper offers an expansive zero-element format that goes beyond GSOS languages and encompasses a wider array of literature examples. It also touches upon how predicates in deduction rules are straightforward to manage, though this topic is covered outside the scope of the current paper abstract.

In sum, the paper provides a framework for determining when semantic properties are preserved by operational rules within the realm of structural operational semantics, making it a valuable tool for language designers and theorists interested in the underlying algebraic properties of language constructs.
