The academic paper discusses the challenges in creating comprehensive evaluations, especially when it comes to qualitative models, although these issues also apply to quantitative ones. It suggests that it is unlikely for a human to establish a total order of preferences across a domain due to various hindrances, such as the complexity of situations or a focus on only a part of the domain. To address this problem, the paper proposes using partial models—based on an idea by de Finetti from probability theory—that only assess certain situations considered relevant. These models allow for an initial focus on relevant situations but can be expanded to cover additional scenarios if needed.

The paper also introduces formal notions for understanding uncertainty orders and their classification. Within the numerical context, it classifies numerical measures by their method of combining information. For example, probabilities are defined by additivity. It examines how qualitative preference orders align with numerical models through representational results.

It further connects qualitative and quantitative measures of uncertainty by showing how each qualitative notion can be related to a corresponding numerical measure. The authors discuss how preference orders are typically characterized by specific axioms, but in their approach, they aim to identify the most appropriate set of axioms based on a given preference relation.

Lastly, the paper provides an informal introduction to the generalizations of probability measures and points the reader to more comprehensive sources for those interested in learning about the relationships between probability measures, belief functions, and possibility measures, with references to additional literature for further exploration.
