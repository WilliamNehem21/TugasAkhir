This paper introduces a visual notation language known as BPSL (Business Process Specification Language) and a supporting toolkit named BPSL Modeler, both designed for the effective specification and verification of business processes. The BPSL Modeler improves the accessibility and comprehension of business property specifications by incorporating a user-friendly visual system while maintaining rigorous formal semantics for formal verification purposes. This system is closely aligned with common business behaviors and leverages intuitive notations, simplifying the specification task.

The paper highlights the advantages of visual representations in clarifying the semantics of temporal operators, which are traditionally complex in temporal logics. The research also references the PSL (Property Specification Language), an IEEE standard for specifying properties in the digital circuit community, noting its benefits in offering a diverse range of temporal operators. Additionally, it mentions previous work such as REGALM (Regulations Expressed as Logical Models) and STRIX, which contribute to the domain of specifying compliance rules and business process model checking, respectively.

The main sections of the paper detail the framework and key concepts of BPSL Modeler, its distinctive characteristics, and its role in model checking business processes. A notable feature is the Boolean Block (BB), which symbolizes a business entity that meets specific pre-defined conditions and is depicted as an octagon containing a name, stereotype, and attributes.

The paper also mentions the concept of 'abortion' in task sequences, which refers to the criteria for prematurely terminating a process (e.g., due to an external cancel event).

In summary, BPSL Modeler aims to facilitate business property specifications and reasoning in business process models by considering visual representation, property compensation, and filtering, among other characteristics. It supports the logics of both LTL (Linear Temporal Logic) and CTL (Computation Tree Logic), and can automatically generate formal semantics for each business property template, thus easing integration with existing formal verification tools. Future plans include applying BPSL Modeler to real-world cases to enhance its practical utility.
