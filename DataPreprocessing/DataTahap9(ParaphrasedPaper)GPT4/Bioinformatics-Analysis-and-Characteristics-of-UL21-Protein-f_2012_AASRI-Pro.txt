Duck Virus Enteritis (DVE), commonly known as duck plague (DP), presents a severe, highly contagious, and often deadly viral infection across all ages in Anseriformes, leading to considerable mortality and reduced egg production in commercial farming, which in turn causes economic losses. The causative agent, Duck enteritis virus (DEV), is categorized within the Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily, though it has not been assigned to a specific genus by the Eighth International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). Past studies have largely focused on the epidemiology, detection, prevention strategies, and the physical structure and development of DEV. However, recent research has been utilizing molecular biology techniques to explore DEV gene expression, protein purification and functionality, and more advanced detection methods.

Herpesviruses generally share a common structural framework which includes a core, a capsid, a tegument layer with numerous proteins, and an external envelope. Particular proteins within the tegument, such as VP1/2, VP11/12, and VP16, among others, serve as connectors between the capsid and envelope.

One such tegument protein, the UL21 gene product from herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), has been shown to encourage the growth of long cell protrusions when overproduced in certain non-neuronal cells and is believed to interact physically with microtubules. Previous studies indicate that UL21-related proteins in both HSV and pseudorabies virus (PRV) are not crucial for viral replication in cell culture. Viruses lacking the UL21 gene reproduced with only slightly reduced potency, but with noticeably smaller plaques. Specifically, in PRV, point mutations in the UL21 gene contribute to the weak nature of the Bartha vaccine strain, and complete absence of the UL21 gene in PRV attenuates virulence in mice, suggesting a link between the UL21 protein and virulence. However, investigations into the DEV UL21 gene product are sparse.

Protein function is closely associated with secondary structure. Higher-order structures, like the alpha-helix, which are more energy-stable, play a significant role in DNA binding, but these structures are usually not B cell epitopes as they often reside within the interior of the protein and do not easily bind antibodies. Conversely, looser and more flexible structures such as extended strands and random coils frequently contain B cell epitopes due to their surface accessibility and ability to undergo conformational changes, making them good candidates for antibody binding. The DEV UL21 protein, in particular, comprises mostly alpha helix and random coil structures, the latter of which may include B cell epitopes. Previous findings suggest that herpes simplex tegument proteins, which are processed for antigen presentation in living organisms, could serve as candidates for herpes simplex vaccines, and that the UL21 protein, with numerous antigenic determinants identified, could similarly be considered for DEV vaccine development to aid in the prevention and diagnosis of Duck Virus Enteritis.
