This paper presents an expanded version of Mignotte's modular secret sharing mechanism, extending it to the domain of polynomial rings, which similarly allow the use of the Chinese remainder theorem due to their Euclidean nature. It demonstrates that this polynomial ring-based approach can support any access structure, which dictates the combinations of shares that can reconstruct the secret. The paper sets limits on the number of participants for a secret sharing scheme where the modulus polynomials are of equal degree. Additionally, it provides a calculation of the information rate—the ratio of the secret's length to the greatest share size in bits—focusing on a binary (q=2) system.

The foundation of secret sharing lies in the mathematical framework that divides a secret into parts, with only certain groups of these parts being able to reconstruct the original secret. Shamir originally introduced this concept, followed by the independent work of Asmuth, Bloom, and Mignotte, who focused on modular secret sharing grounded in the Chinese remainder theorem within the ring of integers. Asmuth and Bloom also suggested the possibility of using other Euclidean rings in addition to the ring of integers. These methodologies primarily handle threshold secret sharing scenarios, where at least k out of t total participants are required to retrieve the secret.

The paper then delivers a proof showing that the maximum number of participants in the threshold secret sharing scheme is determined based on a previously stated lemma. For realizing any chosen access structure, the theorem infers that no more than twice the number of participants' different pairwise co-prime moduli are required.

In conclusion, the research proposes a polynomial modular secret sharing scheme and evaluates its information rate. Though the study outcomes were confirmed post-conference, it is suggested that further research is needed. The paper mentions that using techniques developed by Quisquater, Preneel, and Vanderwalle, who assessed the security of modular schemes in the ring of integers and found them to be only asymptotically secure, it has been proven that the polynomial modular scheme is both perfect and ideal.
