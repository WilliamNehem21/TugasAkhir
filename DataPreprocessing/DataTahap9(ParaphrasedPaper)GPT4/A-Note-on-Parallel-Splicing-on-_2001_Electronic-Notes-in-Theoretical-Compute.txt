L-systems, established in the 1970s to simulate the growth of living organisms, have advanced the study of formal language theory and the life sciences by pioneering the parallel rewriting of string sequences. Additionally, splicing systems, based on biological principles and introduced by Head, aim to replicate certain DNA recombinant processes and have become a key focal point of recent research.

Conversely, for the syntax-based creation and discernment of images, or digitized grids, various two-dimensional grammars have been explored. One model that has extended L-system-like rewriting to these grids has previously been suggested. Furthermore, the concept of local and recognizable string languages has been elegantly expanded to encompass two-dimensional picture languages. More recently, Krithivasan and colleagues have adapted the idea of splicing to work with arrays, thereby creating array splicing systems.

These array splicing systems are noted for their simplicity when compared to other methods for generating picture languages. The paper discusses how certain operations, both geometric and language-theoretic, interact with these systems in terms of closure properties. The research presented may be valuable for enhancing our understanding of image structure.
