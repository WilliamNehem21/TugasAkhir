The research indicates that electrical resistance does not impact the signal measurement, while the change in the signal due to gravity-related differential pressure correlates directly with the distribution of different phases within the flow. Hence, the proposed approach for detecting changes in flow patterns is broadly applicable. By applying wavelet analysis to the gravity differential pressure signal, important features can be extracted that encapsulate information ranging from layered to ring-shaped flows, aiding in the analysis of the forces between different phases that drive changes in flow patterns. The findings offer a novel methodology for better managing the dynamics of gas-liquid two-phase flows.

Furthermore, the study shows that variations in gravity-induced differential pressure signals, which are perpendicular to horizontal flows, are connected to the phase distribution and can also reveal the forces acting between the phases. By identifying specific characteristics through wavelet analysis, the research verifies that wavelet energy is particularly responsive to shifts from layered flows to ring-shaped flows. Through examining how these characteristic features shift in response to changes in flow conditions, and by integrating the analysis of forces between phases, the study provides insight into the underlying causes of flow pattern transformations. This technique for capturing gravity differential pressure fluctuations—which show clear and significant changes correlating with shifts in flow patterns—presents a simple, practical, safe, and precise way to identify different gas-liquid two-phase flow patterns.
