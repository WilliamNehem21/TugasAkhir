The study explores ways to enhance the fermentation process of Phellinus linteus by assessing the impact of various parameters including fermentation temperature, inoculum size, rotation speed, and bottle capacity on mycelium yield. The researchers utilized a quadratic regression orthogonal rotating combination design to create a model for the Phellinus linteus fermentation process, which they also analyzed in detail.

The analysis highlighted that the fermentation temperature, size of the inoculum, rotation speed, and the volume of the fermentation bottle are critical factors influencing the yield. It was particularly noted that the size of inoculum and the bottle volume have a significant interaction. The ideal conditions for Phellinus linteus fermentation were identified as follows: a bottle volume of 120 ml, an inoculum size of 17 ml, a temperature of 26 degrees Celsius, and a rotation speed of 135 rpm, with these conditions yielding a theoretical maximum of 24.51 mg/ml of mycelium.

Phellinus linteus is a traditional medicinal fungus known for its antitumor properties, attributed to its polysaccharides. Due to natural limitations and environmental factors, cultivating it in the wild is difficult. However, fermentation offers a viable alternative since it is not restricted by seasonal changes, leading to reduced development costs.

The paper also describes the preparation of the seed medium for the fermentation process, with a mixture of glucose, peptone, yeast extract, potassium dihydrogen phosphate, magnesium sulfate, and water being inoculated with Phellinus linteus strains and incubated until covered by mycelium.

Finally, it concludes that the interaction between inoculum size and bottle volume significantly influences yield, with smaller bottles requiring larger inoculum sizes. While this leads to a gradual increase in yield, larger bottles significantly enhance yield with increasing inoculum size, aligning with practical production considerations. The experimental findings confirm the model's accuracy and credibility, thus supporting its potential for optimizing real-world Phellinus linteus fermentation processes.
