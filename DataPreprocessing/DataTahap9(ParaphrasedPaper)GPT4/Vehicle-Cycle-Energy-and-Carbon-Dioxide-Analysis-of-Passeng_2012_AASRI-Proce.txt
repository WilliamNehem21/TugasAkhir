This study evaluates the energy use and CO2 emissions from the lifecycle of a typical passenger car in China, powered by an internal combustion engine, with particular focus on the role of coal in the energy mix. Results indicate substantial energy consumption and CO2 emissions, at 91.13 GJ and 11.13 tons per vehicle, respectively, with coal comprising 84.5% of the energy used, significantly influencing emissions. Material production and vehicle assembly are the primary energy and emissions contributors.

Global energy-related CO2 emissions are predicted to rise from 30.2 billion tons in 2008 to 35.2 billion tons by 2020, with non-OECD countries, particularly China, being the major drivers due to extensive coal use for their burgeoning energy needs.

Within a vehicle's lifecycle, the assembly process is particularly energy-intensive, using 29% of total energy and causing 49.7% of emissions, largely from painting, powered predominantly by coal.

The study identifies four strategies to mitigate the environmental impact of vehicle production: reducing vehicle weight without compromising performance, using materials that require less energy and produce fewer emissions, replacing coal with cleaner energy sources, and developing more efficient vehicle propulsion systems.
