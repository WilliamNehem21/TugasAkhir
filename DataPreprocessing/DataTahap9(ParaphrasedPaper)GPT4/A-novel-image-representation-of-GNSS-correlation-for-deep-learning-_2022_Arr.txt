The paper describes the development and evaluation of a convolutional neural network (CNN) model that is robust under challenging signal reception conditions and maintains its performance even when image resolution is reduced. The model's performance surpasses that of an alternative technique employing support vector machines (SVM).

Novel 2D images synthesized from raw GNSS correlator outputs include full multipath information, distinguished from standard techniques that typically use only one-dimensional delay correlation data. This unique comprehensive framework encompasses data generation, CNN architecture selection, training, and validation, emphasizing reproducibility within the research community.

The study acknowledges that GNSS receivers commonly face multiple multipath effects, especially in urban areas with many potential reflectors. However, the research assumes the presence of a direct signal path and considers the impact of only a single multipath contaminant for simplicity.

Data were collected using a high-quality GNSS antenna placed at a location with an unobstructed view to minimize multipath contamination. The collection focused on signals from satellites at high elevation angles to ensure the gathered samples were multipath free. The recording occurred on February 14, 2000, from 08:05 UTC.

The considered model includes the primary I and Q signals, I and Q multipath signals, and correlated receiver noise, assuming that if both the main and multipath signals are received, the correlator output is a summation of the individual correlator outputs for both signals.

CNNs are lauded for their ability to process image data, attributable to their computational efficiency and high performance. The network's learning capability stems from automatic feature construction and combination. The network structure typically starts with multiple convolutional layers, generating feature maps through filtration of the input images. Deeper in the network, these feature maps are used to extract meaningful information. Classification is performed in the final layers using densely connected neurons, with weights learned through supervised learning using gradient back-propagation. The convolutional layers' sparse connectivity and shared weights contribute to computational efficiency.

CNN architectures frequently include pooling layers for dimensionality reduction, a flatten layer to prepare feature maps for dense layers, and dropout mechanisms to enhance generalization by reducing neuron connections randomly.

For practical applications, the paper highlights the VGG-like architecture for its effectiveness in image feature extraction. Despite having a greater number of parameters compared to more complex architectures, VGG-like architecture, due to its simplicity and efficacy in feature extraction, has become a popular choice within the machine learning community. For the research in question, the chosen architecture is a simple form of the VGG-like network, necessary due to the characteristics of the GNSS multipath signals, which do not exhibit multi-scale patterns and therefore do not require a deeply complex network architecture.
