This paper discusses the use of Graph Rewriting (GR) as a tool to support visual modeling within the Tropos framework, which is an agent-oriented software engineering methodology. The authors illustrate how graph rewriting rules can be used to define the syntax of Tropos and how these rules can assist an analyst in constructing models that adhere to the language's specifications. They explore the flexibility offered by GR in accommodating variations of the modeling language and its utility in facilitating incremental modeling. 

Agent-oriented (AO) software engineering is a relatively new paradigm, characterized by an emphasis on agents as the primary elements in developing multi-agent and distributed systems. This paper focuses on AO as defined by multi-agent system engineering and the use in analysis and design phases. Visual modeling, which includes structural representation through diagrams and dynamic specification using temporal logic formulas, is vital in AO and is exemplified by the Tropos methodology.

The authors structure the paper into five main sections. They begin by discussing the challenges of creating a visual modeling tool for Tropos and introduce GR, outlining its key features that will be utilized in their approach. The core of the paper describes their GR-based strategy, detailing the rules that guide the analyst in developing valid Tropos models, support instance building, and address model restructuring and updating. They also highlight how GR allows for the expression of complex conditions, such as negative application conditions and attribute conditions, in rule application.

When using GR, the output is a model that is syntactically correct in relation to the modeling language. Partially correct interim models are expected and used by the analyst to incrementally develop a complete model, receiving guidance about any inconsistencies or errors.

The authors conclude by asserting that the use of GR and the implementation with the AGG tool (attributed graph grammar system) ensure that created instances are consistent with the Tropos model. They promote the AGG tool for its focus on graph transformation and its integration potential with broader functionality tools being developed by the research group. They expect that the GR approach will broadly facilitate the process of adopting language variants and restructuring models in a consistent manner. Future work includes defining a notation for derivation history and further developing and validating the techniques in AGG.
