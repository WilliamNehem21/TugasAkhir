Zhao and colleagues enhanced the Local Binary Pattern (LBP) by introducing an LBP on Three Orthogonal Planes (LBP-TOP) method for dynamic texture recognition and facial expression analysis, where it yielded promising results. The algorithm captures LBP features while considering spatial-temporal co-occurrence, and Shao and colleagues extended this further to cover more dynamic information through their extended LBP-TOP and extended CSLBP-TOP methods, utilizing histograms of LBP patterns in spatio-temporal cuboids and on gradient cuboids.

The paper is structured to explain sub-action usage and to outline the proposed analytical framework, followed by detailed descriptions of the segmentation and classification techniques. Experiments carried out on the UT-Interaction and Rochester datasets show comparisons with other bag-of-words (BoW) based methods, concluding with the approach's robustness against variations and environmental changes being highlighted in the final section.

The authors describe a two-stage segmentation process, aiming to ensure that sub-actions within the same action class are consistent and fully capture motion information for classification. They utilize point density over a set number of frames to accommodate varying action intensities and actor speeds, generating spatial-temporal word occurrence histograms for video clips.

When evaluating datasets, the authors find that their descriptor outperforms the 3D-SIFT descriptor. They also note that while other methods focus on different analytics, such as spatial structure or action prediction, their approach demonstrates superior efficiency and effectiveness in classification.
