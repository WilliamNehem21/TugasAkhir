The academic paper presents a proof of the Abstraction Theorem using an inductive approach focused on derivations. The proof for a specific statement (a) is considered to be relatively straightforward. The discussion in the paper omits the conventional treatment of most rules, focusing instead exclusively on those associated with identity types. While the processing of conversion is not elaborated upon, it is noted that the approach is based on a lemma discussed earlier in the text.

The paper also discusses how the parametricity translation can be effectively applied to inductive families, as outlined in Section 5.4. The method involves translating an inductive type, labeled 'i', into a new inductive type, referred to as 'ir'. This translation process is carried out by converting the constructors of the original inductive type 'i' into those of the new type 'ir'. Additionally, the elimination scheme for the new inductive type 'ir' mirrors the translation of the elimination scheme from the original type 'i'.
