The paper discusses techniques for improving video streaming quality by addressing issues with data transmission over networks. It points out that by using retransmission, the integrity of video frames can be preserved, preventing users from experiencing corrupted images and saving bandwidth by avoiding the transmission of unusable data. Flow control is also highlighted as a means to adapt the transmission speed to the current network capacity, preventing situations where low bandwidth could lead to a reduced frame rate or disrupted viewing experience.

However, the paper notes that the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), commonly used for streaming, is prone to packet loss and congestion without standard procedures for retransmission and flow control, which particularly impacts video streaming quality.

To address these issues, the paper introduces a combined retransmission and flow control method. By selectively retransmitting lost packets and adjusting the sending rate to match network capacity, the approach can substantially reduce the negative impact of packet loss on video streaming. This enhancement allows for a much more satisfactory viewing experience, as viewers can enjoy clear and uninterrupted images.
