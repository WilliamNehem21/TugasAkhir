This paper discusses Picture Fuzzy Sets (PFS), an advancement over traditional fuzzy sets and intuitionistic fuzzy sets, defined by three functions: positive, neutral, and negative membership. Highlighting the significance of similarity measures in areas like data mining and medical diagnosis, the authors note that some existing measures are flawed, violating similarity axioms or leading to paradoxical situations.

To address these issues, the paper introduces new similarity measures for PFSs that factor in two parameters: t, which quantifies uncertainty levels, and p, represented by the Lp norm. The authors elaborate on the theoretical properties of these measures, providing counterexamples that showcase the deficiencies of previous measures and emphasizing the advantages of their approach, particularly in pattern recognition.

Earlier in literature, hybrid models like Picture Fuzzy Soft Sets (PFSS) and Generalized Picture Fuzzy Soft Sets (GPFSS) were studied for their decision-making capabilities. New similarity and distance measures for PFSs are crucial in applications across various fields. The paper describes distance and similarity measures derived from PFSs and how they've been employed in decision-making and pattern recognition.

The study then focuses on the role of PFSs in medical diagnosis, elucidating how PFSs capture a broader range of human responses—acceptance, rejection, neutrality, and abstention—better than traditional fuzzy sets. These are important in complex scenarios where multiple types of responses are involved.

The new distance and similarity measures for PFSs are presented and explained, incorporating the parameters p and t. A numerical example demonstrates how the proposed measures can be applied in medical diagnosis. The paper concludes with a comparative analysis and a discussion on the reliability of the new measures, noting that the diagnosis remains consistent across varying values of p and depends on the level of uncertainty (t) in the given dataset.
