Although the theoretical model of one-way quantum computation has been recognized as significant since its beginnings, only recently have some of its measurement-based protocols been demonstrated experimentally. Before these protocols can be scaled up and implemented on physical systems, various challenges must be addressed. This paper focuses specifically on an efficient implementation of the feedforward mechanism, which allows the measurement angles to adapt based on the results of previous measurements. The authors propose a variant of the one-way model that uses only Pauli measurements and demonstrate its approximate universality. This simplifies the feedforward mechanism since it only needs to make binary decisions.

The paper outlines three conditions necessary for the practical execution of measurement patterns. The first condition ensures that any necessary corrections can be computed from the available measurement results before they are applied. The second condition prohibits the reuse of qubits; while this could save resources, it compromises the ability to pre-establish a standardized entanglement pattern and would require re-entangling qubits during the computation, thus adding complexity. Finally, the third condition is that after all measurements have been performed, the qubits designated to hold the output are not entangled with any other qubits, allowing for clear extraction of the computation results.
