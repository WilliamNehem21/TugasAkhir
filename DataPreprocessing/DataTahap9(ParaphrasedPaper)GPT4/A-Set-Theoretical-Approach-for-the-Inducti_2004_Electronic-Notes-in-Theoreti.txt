The paper introduces a novel method for automatically generating inheritance hierarchies using the principles of formal concept analysis (FCA), a mathematical framework for data analysis. This approach organizes lexical knowledge into structured networks, specifically concept lattices, based on an analysis of unstructured data. The paper discusses the creation of an inheritance hierarchy for English and German lemmatization information using the CELEX lexical database, highlighting how the application of an Attribute-Object-Concept (AOC) poset significantly reduces the complexity of the representation compared to a standard concept lattice.

Additionally, the paper explores the challenges of developing nonmonotonic inheritance networks from data that do not explicitly present nonmonotonic relationships. The distinction is made between regular, default cases, which reside at higher levels of the hierarchy, and subregularities or exceptions, which are positioned at lower levels. The paper suggests ways to model subregularities using defaults and discusses methods for managing attribute inheritance, including addressing exceptions and subregularities by considering partial implications that hold true except for specific exceptional cases.

Overall, the paper emphasizes the potential of FCA for structuring lexical knowledge and suggests a methodology for contending with the complexity of nonmonotonic relations in inheritance networks.
