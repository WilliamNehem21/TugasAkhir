The paper discusses how biochemical networks can be represented by carefully defined reaction lists, from which biologists can create SCCP (a computational modeling language) models. These models allow for the corresponding Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) to be generated automatically. The paper investigates the coherence between the dynamics described by SCCP models and the typical ODEs used in biochemistry, asserting that the SCCP method preserves the rate semantics of the reactions.

Additionally, the paper describes a feature of the SCCP language that enables 'tell' instructions to execute instantaneously at an infinite rate whenever they are encountered by an "agent" within the model. To handle these types of instructions as well as to manage procedure calls, two kinds of transition relations are defined: one instantaneous and one stochastic. These transitions are used alternatelyâ€”first applying the instantaneous transitions as much as possible, followed by a single step of the stochastic transition. The syntax of the language ensures that the instantaneous transitions consistently lead to the same result (confluence) and that they will stop after a finite number of steps, ensuring that the stochastic transitions are based on a stable state.

Furthermore, the paper mentions that an interpreter for SCCP has been developed, which is capable of running simulations. This interpreter is implemented in Prolog, a programming language frequently used for symbolic reasoning and logic programming. It leverages a standard constraint-solver geared towards finite domains to handle constraints within simulation runs. The paper includes results from simulations performed with this interpreter to demonstrate the capabilities of SCCP in modeling biochemical networks.
