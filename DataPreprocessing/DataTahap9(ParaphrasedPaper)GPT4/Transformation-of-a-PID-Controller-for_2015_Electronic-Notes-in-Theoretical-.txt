Floating-point calculations in numerical programs are highly sensitive to the formulation of expressions. Tiny alterations in the arrangement of mathematical expressions, despite no change in their underlying meaning, can result in considerable variations in computational outcomes. This is due to the characteristics of floating-point arithmetic, where operations like addition aren't associative, and multiplication isn't always reversible. Predicting which particular formulation of an expression yields the highest precision in floating-point arithmetic is challenging. Recent advancements have been made in abstract interpretation techniques to estimate the bounds of rounding errors in computations.

The article described here presents a case study exploring the automatic transformation of larger code segments, including assignments and control structures, to enhance accuracy. It centres on modifying the code of a PID controller for better precision. The research compares different code versions that, while mathematically equivalent, demonstrate notable differences in computational accuracy.

The paper's structure introduces the original PID controller (PID1) and details the subsequent transformations leading to versions PID2 and PID3. Experimental results are presented to showcase the impact of these modifications on accuracy. These results highlight that even small syntactic changes can have substantial effects on precision. For example, transforming an expression "r = p + i + d" by inlining the terms and factoring "e" demonstrates a marked impact on accuracy.

The study suggests that the transformations applied from PID1 through to PID3 could potentially be automated using systematic and general rules that are not specific to the example used in the study. Techniques like inlining expressions, partial evaluation, and loop unfolding are key to these transformations. Applying these transformations has shown a significant influence on the accuracy of numerical results, varying by several percent, thus reinforcing the importance of careful code writing in numerical programming.
