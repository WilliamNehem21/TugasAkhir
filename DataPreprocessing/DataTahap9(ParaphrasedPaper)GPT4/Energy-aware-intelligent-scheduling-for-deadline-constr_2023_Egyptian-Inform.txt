The paper is structured as follows:

1. Section 2 provides an overview of the power consumption and workflow models and delineates the workflow scheduling issue as a problem that is constrained and focused on a single aim.
2. In Section 3, the paper details the development of an energy-conscious intelligent algorithm.
3. Section 4 presents the validation of the algorithm with numerical experiments.
4. The paper concludes in Section 5, summarizing the findings and suggesting two potential avenues for future research.

Within the study, solutions are represented as two sequences, each with 'n' elements. The initial vector relates tasks to virtual machines, with the element's position representing a task and the value indicating the chosen machine for its execution. The second vector associates tasks with their corresponding execution times, with each element's position again representing a task and the value detailing the time it will take.

The principal focus is on the proposed energy-efficient scheduling algorithm (EIS), with its methodology outlined as Algorithm 1. This algorithm requires inputs such as workflow data, candidate resources, the size of the population for simulation, and a maximum threshold for function evaluations that dictate when to halt the process. EIS's objective is to identify a scheduling plan that minimizes energy consumption upon reaching the stopping condition.

Algorithms 2 and 3 refine the process by optimizing the execution times for tasks, i.e., the second vector in the encoded solution. These procedures include an assessment of energy usage for each potential schedule, leading to the creation of subsequent generations within the population (line 7) and updating the count of function evaluations (line 8).

A key distinction between EIS and non-STA, another variant discussed, is that EIS implements the function 'slacktimeassignment()', which is absent in non-STA. By comparing the energy savings between the two algorithms, it's noted that EIS's energy reduction benefit can be largely ascribed to the utilization of the 'slacktimeassignment()' function. A case in point is the energy savings observed with the "montage_100" workflow, where this function plays a significant role.
