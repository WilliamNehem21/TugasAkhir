The authors discuss challenges encountered when creating software to manage embedded systems within consumer electronics (CE) products like televisions. These challenges arise due to the dependency of the control tasks on the hardware topology, which can change across different product models or even during the development of a single product. In response to these challenges, the authors suggest a strategy where components communicate through both horizontal and vertical interfaces. This allows each component, which corresponds to a specific hardware device, to have input and output ports that reflect its associated hardware, thereby facilitating communication.

The paper further describes a situation where two operations, a loop and a blanking operation between two points, C and D, happen simultaneously but don't require explicit representation of concurrency on the Live Sequence Chart (LSC) because they involve separate components. However, if a component were involved in both operations, a "coregion" notation with dotted lines could be used to denote the concurrent activities.

The authors showcase their approach using a small case study from the consumer electronics sector. They model component interactions using LSCs, formalize them using snapshots derived from these charts, and aim to initiate component models based on the mandatory behavior indicated in LSCs, as outlined in other works referenced in the paper ([7,8]).
