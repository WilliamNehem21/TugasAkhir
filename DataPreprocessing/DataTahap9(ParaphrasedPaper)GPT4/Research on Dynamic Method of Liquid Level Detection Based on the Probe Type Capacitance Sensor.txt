This academic paper discusses improvements to the process of liquid sampling in automatic clinical analysis instruments. Traditional methods using a one-way approach have issues like low precision, inaccuracy in liquid uptake, incomplete sampling, and obstructions in the pipette tips. The paper introduces a dynamic level detection approach using a capacitance sensor to address these issues. This approach mitigates the impact of motor drive inertia and the micro-capillary effects caused by the probe's contact with the liquid.

The paper describes that the probe type capacitance sensor, unlike conventional plate capacitance sensors, is a conductor situated close to a metal frame at the base of the sample cup. This arrangement forms a capacitance sensor where air acts as the insulating medium. Given the irregular shape of the probe, an accurate mathematical model is difficult to establish, and only a basic estimate can be made.

The authors mention that slight fluctuations affect the system, and after extensive experimentation, a 0.1V standard was chosen to initiate sampling via the TMS320F2812's ADC module when the probe touches or leaves the liquid surface.

When selecting this standard value, the researchers considered factors like motor motion inertia and errors from the micro-capillary effect. The dynamic method was shown to effectively reduce errors from motor inertia. However, setting the standard value too low would result in significant measurement errors due to the micro-capillary effect. Ultimately, 0.1V was deemed the optimal balance for the experiments.

To enhance the precision of capacitance sensor readings, the paper suggests applying grey dynamic filtering, specifically a dynamic GM(1, 1) model, to stabilize the output. This is paired with noise filtering of the sampling results. Through thorough experimentation, the optimal standard value for liquid surface detection was determined, effectively reducing errors associated with the micro-capillary effect and improving the accuracy of liquid level detection in the dynamic measurement method. As a result, the dynamic method demonstrated better performance, achieving an improved accuracy of 0.1mm compared to 0.3mm in the single-direction method, and also minimizing contamination risks associated with the probe.
