The academic paper discusses the vital role of information technology (IT) governance in managing risks to create a secure environment for e-business and e-commerce. Various IT organizations have developed several risk management methods to assist enterprises from different sectors in identifying, evaluating, and mitigating IT risks.

The focus of the paper is to present a comprehensive Information Security Risk Management (ISRM) framework tailored to IT-using enterprises. This framework is structured around the STOPE (Strategy, Technology, Organization, People, and Environment) model, which is instrumental in categorizing information security across five distinct domains. It incorporates the Six Sigma DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control) methodology as a cyclic process for management. The framework also emphasizes evaluation tools for each procedural phase and management criteria for structural issues. It promotes the integration and refinement of various existing risk management methods and standards within its structure and procedures. Describing this framework's importance, the paper positions it as a potential open standard for enterprise ISRM.

Despite the availability of numerous standard and commercial risk management methods, their adoption within organizations remains limited. Challenges such as lack of awareness, high costs, the need for expert knowledge, and the time-consuming nature of the processes have been cited as reasons. Additionally, the trust in these methods is undermined by ineffective outcomes, complex reports, and a narrow technological focus. The proliferation of more than 200 different risk management methods further complicates the selection process for organizations, and the absence of a universally accepted benchmark or comparative framework hinders the practical application of these methods for assessing enterprise information security risks.

The proposed ISRM framework consists of two primary components: a structural view and a procedural view. The structural view comprises the scope and criteria dimensions, while the procedural view includes process and tools dimensions. The paper delineates this framework according to these four dimensions, offering it as a potential solution for the outlined challenges in adopting risk management methods in enterprises.
