The paper discusses the integration and impact of technology in built environments, emphasizing the potential of public displays, location sensors, and mobile devices to transform user experiences and behaviors. Smart environments provide tailored information and services to support the diverse roles and activities of their occupants, while also presenting unique challenges in both human and system engineering.

To assess usability in ubiquitous computing systems, scenario analysis and persona development can be employed. The design should ensure interactions with personal and public devices are seamless and user-friendly, avoiding undue control over the user. Informal methods like cognitive walkthroughs and heuristic evaluations can offer preliminary design insights.

Formal models of ubiquitous systems can simulate or check properties before implementation. These models help to examine design alternatives cost-effectively by focusing on relevant properties, information deployment, activity scheduling, and location issues.

Interactions between users and systems can be complicated by variables such as location, task status, and other users. Additionally, timing of messages is critical for their relevance and utility. Models not only examine device-user interactions, such as mode confusion, but also assess how environmental information supports user actions.

The GAUDI system example from Lancaster University demonstrates this concept. GAUDI replaces static signs with dynamic displays to guide users through a building. By selecting their destination on a touchscreen, a coordinated system of displays provides navigational arrows. This system is considered to be a type of ‘calm technology’ that operates unobtrusively in the background.

The GAUDI model includes assumptions about user behavior, like response to potential collisions and navigation prompts, and these assumptions underpin the system’s functionality. Using a stochastic model, one could explore the likelihood of user errors in following directions.

Properties of the smart environment can be identified and automatically checked against models to produce scenarios for further analysis. These checks ensure the system doesn’t remain indefinitely in a particular state and consider user dwell times at displays.

In summary, factoring user experience into the design of ambient and mobile systems is crucial, and the paper by Harrison et al. suggests utilizing formal models and property checking as tools for shaping and evaluating the usability of such systems.
