The paper discusses the challenges faced by mathematicians in the field of formalized mathematics, which is overlooked by the broader mathematical community for several reasons. Firstly, proof assistants, which are crucial to formalized mathematics, take months to learn. Even after mastering these tools, formally proving basic results can be a time-consuming and dull process. Moreover, the formal texts produced are often unintelligible to those not versed in the specific tools used.

The work further delves into the complexities of interpreting formalized category theory, which is not straightforwardly aligned with the more typical presentations of category theory found in mathematics texts. This formalization develops more category theory than previous ones, yet it is reliant on an understanding of constructive dependent type theory.

The paper also compares two Mizar system developments which take different approaches to conceptualizing arrows within a category. While source files for these developments are not available and may not be compatible with newer versions of the system, the main focus of such formalizations has been proving significant results such as the adjoint functor theorem.

A comprehensive formal development created with Isabelle/HOL spans 27 pages, with both the text and source files accessible online. The paper presents some key definitions, results, and sample proofs. It notably omits simple category lemmas and proceeds to the definitions of categories of sets within a specified universe, rather than postulating a universal set.

In explaining functors, the paper encounters challenges with type inference within the proof assistant, necessitating the use of alternative notation instead of the customary informal one. Functors are treated within a specific context using predicates, saving arguments and facilitating the reasoning process.

An example showcased in the paper highlights the elaborate nature of Isar proofs compared to more conventional textbook proofs, with many steps only present to guide the proof assistant rather than for reader comprehension. The authors suggest that more effective automation could be achieved by leveraging the tactics used in other formalizations, although they do not aim for complete automation but rather to simplify the process for human understanding.
