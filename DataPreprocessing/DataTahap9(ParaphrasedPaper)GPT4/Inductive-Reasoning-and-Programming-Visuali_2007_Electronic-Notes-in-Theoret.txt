This academic paper outlines a research project focused on examining the impact of Inductive Reasoning Ability (IRA) on the effectiveness of Program Visualization (PV) systems, particularly the Jeliot 3 system. The researchers argue that current PV systems do not account for the varying abilities and knowledge of students, offering the same visualizations regardless of individual needs. They propose that IRA could play a key role in understanding PV animations, allowing for the customization of visualizations to better suit different learners.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of the concept of inductive reasoning. Section 3 describes the Jeliot 3 PV system, including modifications to support the study. Section 4 outlines the planned experiment. The paper concludes with a discussion of the potential implications of the anticipated findings.

The authors reference previous research indicating that problem-solving skills in physics derive from reflective practices, enhancing knowledge from prior problem-solving experiencesâ€”a concept related to inductive reasoning. They posit that similar principles might apply to understanding program visualization.

Jeliot 3 is introduced as an educational tool used both in traditional classrooms and distance learning to help students comprehend Java program execution through animation. However, issues have been identified; notably, Jeliot 3 is not equally beneficial for all students. In classroom settings, average students gain the most, while the tool may be too complex for weaker students and unnecessary for the strongest ones, potentially impeding their learning.

For distance learners, who lack face-to-face teacher guidance, the system should not only be motivating but also serve as a supplementary educational resource, offering explanations and help when needed. The researchers plan to track students' progress through weekly lessons, conducting pre-tests and post-tests tied to each concept introduced.

In Week 2 of the course, students will be introduced to Jeliot 3 and the study's experiment. They will use a web-based version of Jeliot, which will connect to an online student model, updating as students respond to questions.

In summary, the paper proposes an investigation into the relationship between IRA and the usability of PV tools, suggesting that adaptive visualizations based on IRA could enhance educational outcomes for students learning to program.
