The Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) is a type of adaptive network derived from the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy inference system. It is an AI model that excels at self-learning and adapting its rules to deal with a changing environment and uncertainty. This system merges the principles of neural networks and fuzzy logic to form an intelligent computational framework.

The validity of a quadratic model was gauged by its p-value from an analysis of variance (ANOVA) and its correlation coefficient (R²). The difference between experimental data and the model's predicted values helped establish the significance of the regression model. Three-dimensional surface plots were used to examine how input variables interacted with each other.

Both the ANFIS and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models were simulated in MATLAB software version 8.5 (2015). The ANN model successfully used experimental data shaped by the Response Surface Methodology (RSM) with 70% of data for training, 15% for testing, and the rest for validation. Using more data for training reduces processing time and improves model generalization according to Kiran and Pragnesh (2016). The test data acted as an independent performance measure during and after training, whereas validation helped avoid model overfitting.

The ANN was modeled using a Levenberg-Marquardt learning algorithm, with inputs and responses normalized between 0 and 1 for error reduction. The TrainLM function regulated the bias value with this algorithm. A trial-and-error method determined the optimal number of hidden neurons, balancing the network's complexity and convergence rate.

The p-value informed the statistical significance of a hypothesis, with a model F-value of 280.27 and a p-value below 0.0001 indicating a significant quadratic model. Terms with p-values below 0.05 at a 95% significance level were considered significant. The drying time (X1), airspeed (X2), temperature (X3), their interactions, and squared terms (except for the squared term X2) had significant effects on the response, with drying time being the most influential.

The study found increasing drying time reduced moisture in potato slices, while airspeed had the least impact among the variables. The shape of the 3D curves indicated strong variable correlations, supporting the quadratic model's appropriateness, consistent with findings from Oguanobi et al. (2019).

Comparisons revealed RSM and ANFIS with R² values of 0.998 provided better predictions than the ANN, which had an R² of 0.970. ANFIS and RSM also outperformed ANN in terms of error metrics in predicting moisture reduction during potato drying.

In conclusion, RSM, ANFIS, and ANN models were deployed to predict moisture reduction in dried potato slices. A quadratic RSM model with a high R² of 0.9980 was selected, and ANFIS showed excellent predictive performance with a comparable R² and low training error. Comparative analysis determined that RSM and ANFIS yielded more accurate predictions than ANN for this application.
