In the study, the authors examine how the output of a system is affected by changes in the input. Specifically, they explore the rate at which a self-map stabilizes to a steady state, highlighting the nature of the steady state as a potential local attractor. This conceptual framework has been applied to analyze the intricacy of computational algorithms and in the quest to locate stable solutions and zeros of mathematical functions.
