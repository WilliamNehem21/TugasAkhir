In Remark 4.3 of the academic paper, the authors explain that state variables could be integrated within the original term language. A state variable operates as a unary function symbol that is restricted to appearing only at the beginning of a term. This approach coherently extends the use of dot-notation for applying unary functions; in this notation, `a.t` is equivalent to applying function `a` to term `t`. The established rules of the system continue to hold if the interpretation of a state variable is expanded from being a singular state to functioning as a unary function that operates on states. The paper claims that completeness—which is demonstrated later in the text—remains unaffected by this broader interpretation.

State variables are distinct from regular function symbols in that there is an infinite number of state variables available. This ensures that new variables can be introduced as necessary, and existing state variables can be renamed without restrictions.

When deriving the equality `c.s = d.t`, similar strategies to disjunction elimination and existential elimination in natural deduction are applied. This involves assuming the different possible outcomes `xi` of a labeled term `a.r` and, for each outcome, naming the resulting post-state with a new identifier `b`. There is also a rule akin to negation elimination that governs the left side of the equation and another rule that maintains the validity of all the instances of axioms after they have been subjected to substitutions on the right side.

For proving completeness, the authors specify that they define substitution as an axiom within their system, as contrasted with a rule. This is because while the substitution axiom is consistent with reasoning that includes bisimilarity, the rule of substitution is not; however, treating substitution as an axiom is permissible.

The concept of comodel states that may differ but are observationally identical is a familiar aspect in the context of bisimilarity. The authors apply the principle of bisimilarity to their framework of comodels, simplifying notation by considering bisimilarity within a single comodel. They claim that this simplification doesn't result in any loss of generality because bisimilarity between two models can be addressed as bisimilarity within a combined model, or coproduct.
