This paper tackles the challenge of determining optimal room rates to maximize hotel revenue. A new hotel revenue management model is proposed, utilizing dynamic pricing to offer hotel managers a decision support tool that is both flexible and efficient. The framework is built upon two components: a unique optimization model and a multi-class scheme akin to that used by airlines. The authors postulate that this model can bridge the gaps in existing pricing research and greatly enhance hotel revenues.

To validate their hypothesis, the authors compared three different approaches using this model against traditional methods. Results indicated a revenue increase over the conventional models cited in prior literature.

The new strategy employs non-linear programming instead of dynamic programming, enabling the resolution of the model nightly on the hotel's server during idle hours, thus incurring minimal overhead costs.

The model produces optimal nightly room rates, which can be presented to customers as an average to prevent dissatisfaction from fluctuating daily prices. The system is designed to seamlessly integrate into online booking platforms without approximations.

Integrating this dynamic pricing model required understanding key features of hotel management, gained through interviews with industry experts. The desired multi-category system, mirroring airline pricing, involves setting various prices each night, correlated to different demand levels.

The authors executed a parametric analysis on the proposed model to generate distinct rates for each category. This method enables dynamic price adjustments based on forecasted demand scenarios.

The paper provides a case study simulation to test the proposed model, analyzing optimal pricing for a future three-month period. Data from past reservations were used to forecast demand and inform the optimization model. The case study involved a 90-night horizon, with the hotel accommodating 80 rooms at a nominal rate of $120, and a maximum guest stay of 14 days.

The research concludes that the proposed dynamic pricing model has the potential to substantially increase hotel revenue without being specific to a particular hotel class, suggesting it could be broadly applicable across different types of hotels. The paper finalizes by reiterating that it addresses the challenge of integrating price elasticity into a dynamic pricing model, offering an innovative multi-category approach, and promises to overcome existing research gaps while boosting hotel revenue.
