In this academic paper, the authors describe a method for extending algebraic operations to a very large space and then narrowing the focus to specific subspaces that satisfy certain properties. The process is structured as follows:

Initially, the authors choose a vast space consisting of all nonempty closed subsets endowed with the weak topology. Algebraic operations are then extended to this space. Following that, the authors refine these extended operations by applying them to the sobrification of the original space. Sobrification refers to a process in which the original space becomes a subspace by identifying certain irreducible closed subsets.

Next, the focus is narrowed further to the d-completion, which is itself a subspace within the sobrification. The d-completion is of particular interest because it satisfies additional conditions of completeness.

The paper also revisits some fundamental concepts related to the Scott topology, which is a topology defined on a partially ordered set (poset). In the Scott topology, the closed sets are precisely those sets that are "lower sets" and are also closed under the formation of suprema (least upper bounds) of directed sets whenever such suprema exist.

A function is considered Scott-continuous if it maintains continuity with respect to the Scott topology on both the domain and codomain. The authors reference a lemma that addresses this continuity in a general context.

They further explain that semitopological algebras, endowed with the specialization order, are in fact partially ordered algebras due to continuous functions preserving the order. It is noted that the specialization order can align with the underlying order when considering topological algebras with certain types of topologies (e.g., Alexandroff).

Additionally, the paper discusses spaces known as conditionally up-complete, where if a subset is directed and bounded above, it must have a supremum (greatest lower bound) to which it converges. It is noted that every topological space has a conditional d-completion, which can be realized as a strongly dense embedding into conditionally up-complete spaces.

Furthermore, the authors introduce continuous partially ordered algebras, which are algebras with a continuous poset structure where all basic algebraic operations are Scott-continuous. If such an algebra also forms a directed complete partial order (dcpo), it is termed a continuous dcpo-algebra and hence a topological algebra regarding the Scott topology.

Motivated by potential applications in areas such as probabilistic semantics and potential theory, the authors are particularly interested in exploring d-completions in relation to the study of cones, specifically T0-cones. They mention that cone operations can be extended to the d-completion and express an intent to examine cones and d-completions more closely in future research efforts.
