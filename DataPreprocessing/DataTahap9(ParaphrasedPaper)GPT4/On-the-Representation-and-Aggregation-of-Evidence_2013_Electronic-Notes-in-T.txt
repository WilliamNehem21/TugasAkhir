The paper discusses the challenges inherent to the informal and fragmented nature of knowledge representation in professional practice. While this informal knowledge is highly relevant as it's rooted in direct experience, it's often disorderly and lacks rigorous structure, making it hard to form a cohesive body of knowledge.

To address this, the authors propose using theories as a framework to organize and aggregate evidence. In many scientific domains, theories provide a solid foundation for the systematic buildup of knowledge, reducing complexity and facilitating the communication of ideas via a common conceptual framework.

The paper then outlines its structure, beginning with a detailed conceptualization of theory and the use of the Dempster-Shafer theory for evidence aggregation. The following sections describe the proposed approach, discuss its advantages and drawbacks, reflect on the perspective of industry practitioners, and finally look towards future research directions.

The authors explain a novel decision-making criterion using belief functions and note that beliefs assigned to theory propositions can vary. In their example, all propositions are assigned a belief of 0.65 based on qualitative and quantitative evidence from an action research study. They acknowledge the need for a more systematic method to determine individual belief levels.

The paper describes the aggregation process at a high level and plans for future research to refine the details. By applying their process to evidence from a software inspection study, the authors build a theory that represents a broadly accepted understanding of the subject matter.

Despite the mostly quantitative nature of the study data, they transform these into qualitative proposition values for theory construction. The results show high belief values for the propositions, indicating strong agreement and confidence in the evidence.

The paper then discusses the importance of evaluating evidence quality and strength. The authors propose using grading schemes like GRADE to enhance the accuracy of belief estimation, especially as they begin to incorporate various forms of evidence, including the less robust or complete.

Lastly, the paper suggests that software project post-mortems could serve as a valuable source of informal evidence. Translating this knowledge into theoretical representations facilitates its aggregation, which can guide decision-making and hypothesis formation. Despite potential struggles with industry adoption, the authors posit that leveraging this approach can reveal meaningful patterns in real-world data.
