The Adaptive Competitive Learning (ACL) neural network algorithm introduces an innovative criterion, the ACL criterion, for forming and evaluating clusters within a dataset. Unlike previous methods, ACL not only clusters input feature vectors based on similarity but also autonomously determines the optimal number of clusters. It seeks to create clusters that are compact, well-defined, balanced in size, and represented by a neural network architecture with minimum complexity, which translates to fewer neurons. 

To assess clustering quality, the ACL criterion selects structures with minimal within-cluster variance and optimizes the product of clusters' relative weights. The study compares ACL with a recent literature-proposed algorithm, the EMCE, which uses mixture models and a criterion rooted in likelihood and mutual information theory. The ACL is put to the test against various datasets using MATLAB, showing it performs particularly well on sparsely distributed datasets without overlapping clusters, demonstrating more accurate and robust clustering and better resistance to the curse of dimensionality compared to EMCE. Furthermore, ACL doesn't impose a Gaussian shape on clusters as EMCE does.

The paper illustrates that the ACL algorithm outperforms EMCE on separation-specific datasets and achieves high robustness in Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) results for most datasets, except the Iris and Seeds datasets where EMCE excels due to overlapping clusters. Overall, ACL's clustering results are accurate and robust, especially when datasets lack overlapping clusters and are sparsely distributed.
