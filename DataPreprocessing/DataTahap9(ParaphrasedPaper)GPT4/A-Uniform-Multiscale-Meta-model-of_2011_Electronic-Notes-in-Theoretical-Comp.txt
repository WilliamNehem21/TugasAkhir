The academic paper discusses the complexity and expressiveness of multiscale (MS) models in comparison to single-scale ones, emphasizing that MS models are not inherently more expressive; their expressiveness depends on the choice of models for each scale and the methods of integrating them. Homogenizing these models can be challenging and may result in loss of information between scales, particularly when single-scale models are diverse or multiple homogenization techniques are available.

The paper cites an example in the field of bone remodeling, a biological process that benefits from a MS approach due to the strong mutual influences between its macroscopic behavior and microstructure. The study draws inspiration from the Complex Automata (CxA) paradigm, referencing a two-scale CxA model for bone remodeling previously proposed and simulated using BioShape.

BioShape is described as a spatial 3D simulator designed for MS modeling and simulation of biological entities, which are represented as geometric 3D shapes. These entities are independent, with their own shapes and behaviors, and interact via a combination of process algebra (specifically, shape calculus) and Java programming. The interactions occur when entities with compatible "channels" collide on a common surface, creating a new entity with a combined shape and behavior.

The researchers propose an enhanced meta-model for BioShape to encompass various MS coupling mechanisms. They outline the components needed to run a model, the simulation's main loop, and how to interconnect and execute models at different scales with specified coupling schemes.

The paper introduces the concept of a "world space," where 3D processes occur within a fixed global coordinate system, and discusses the construction of instances for both world space and 3D processes. It requires that created 3D networks be "well-formed," meaning no overlapping or out-of-bound shapes are allowed.

Focusing on bone remodeling as a case study, they explain how to formulate a MS model using the CxA approach and BioShape, highlighting the micromacro coupling scheme. In this model, each lattice cube within the macro model is paired with a micro model representing a basic multicellular unit (BMU). The spatial scale here is in micrometers, and the temporal scale is daily. The micro model's world space matches a lattice cube from the macro model, where shapes are modeled and coupled directly through an automatic mechanism derived from the coupling scheme.

Finally, the paper addresses the implementation of the BioShape meta-model in the simulator, noting that BioShape is engineered for compatibility with various computational platforms. This allows for the concurrent running of multiple models on different nodes, each supported by multiple platforms. A global coordinator oversees the balanced distribution of calculations across platforms and controls the timing of the simulation loop's steps.
