Petri nets are commonly employed to model and analyze concurrent systems. On the other hand, dynamic logics (DL) represent a group of modal logics that interpret each modality as a corresponding program action. This paper introduces a resolution-based approach for Petri-PDL, which is a variant of DL, substituting traditional programs with Petri nets in its modalities.

The technique involves transforming Petri-PDL statements into a standard form, which can then be tackled using a set of resolution-based rules designed for inference. The paper showcases how to apply this method using example cases and delves into the soundness and completeness of the approach.

This work asserts that the system of axioms for Petri-PDL is not only sound and complete, but also its related satisfiability problems are solvable. While other approaches for reasoning about Petri net properties exist, they often fall short in either completeness or decidability.

Petri-PDL integrates Petri nets directly into its language, allowing for a more intuitive means to specify complex system behaviors and check their associated properties without the need to translate Petri nets into a separate language. Moreover, the logical abstraction level provided does not introduce additional complexity.

The paper is outlined to first explain marked Petri nets, then introduces the reader to the syntax, semantics, and the principles behind Petri-PDL. Next, it details the new resolution-based framework for Petri-PDL, including the process of converting formulae to a normal form, the rules of inference, and key results with examples. It concludes with comments on future lines of research.

In summary, this paper presents a sound strategy for proving the satisfiability of Petri-PDL formulae, a logical system that combines the visual aspects of Petri nets with the features of a decidable and complete logic fragment. Formulae are converted into an anti-prenex normal form (APNF) as a preliminary step, followed by simplification to enhance the resulting clause sets. The paper claims soundness and efficient execution for the satisfiability checking method, promising ongoing research on its completeness and the development of strategies for practical application. Future work includes creating an automatic theorem prover and extending the method to encompass DS3, a logic that integrates stochastic elements into Petri-PDL to model systems with probabilistic timing variations.
