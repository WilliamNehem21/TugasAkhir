The paper examines the impact of convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture on feature extraction for video captioning tasks. It studies five CNN models with varying depths and structures and concludes that models with greater expressive capabilities yield better results. Notably, the choice of CNN can significantly enhance performance in video captioning frameworks.

The paper also reviews recent advancements that modify the encoder-decoder framework, including approaches for modeling long-term visual-textual dependencies, selecting key video frames, and capturing temporal information in video representations. It highlights the importance of understanding the contribution of each module in the encoder-decoder architecture to the overall performance.

The authors describe their experimental setup, which includes evaluating four main components of video captioning: CNN models for video feature encoding, feature transformation methods, word embeddings for numerical representation of words, and the language model for turning visual features into natural language descriptions. They use various metrics and a common dataset (MSVD) to assess the generated captions' quality.

The findings show that deeper networks tend to offer performance improvements, but beyond a certain depth, additional layers do not enhance the model's classification accuracy. This problem has been addressed in CNNs with the introduction of residual blocks. The paper also discusses the nuances of word embeddings and the relative importance of model depth, hyper-parameter settings, and model fine-tuning.

Ultimately, the research indicates that choosing an appropriate CNN for visual feature encoding can lead to significant performance gains in video captioning, with a potential increase of up to 60% for certain metrics. While the choice of word embeddings also affects performance, the CNN model's selection has a more pronounced impact. The paper suggests that fine-tuning pretrained word embeddings shows limited improvement, underscoring the dominant effect of CNN choice over word embedding selection.
