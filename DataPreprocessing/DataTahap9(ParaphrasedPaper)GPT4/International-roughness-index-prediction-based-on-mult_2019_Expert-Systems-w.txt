In the field of transportation engineering, prioritizing safety is crucial. Therefore, efforts should be dedicated to thoroughly understanding the service conditions and progression of road roughness. The International Roughness Index (IRI), first proposed by the University of Michigan, measures pavement roughness through its impact on vehicle vibrations. Research into predicting IRI values using fuzzy time-series methods is necessary, as current literature lacks in this area. These methods have been successfully implemented in other domains, like stock and weather forecasting, and can potentially enhance IRI prediction techniques.

The current study develops a prediction method for IRI using advanced fuzzy time-series analysis, contemplating multifactor and multilevel scenarios. The approach starts with automatic clustering to identify granular time intervals, followed by establishing a second-order fuzzy-trend matrix and classification to predict trends of contributing factors within granular spaces considering uncertainties. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) optimizes the final IRI values. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance in comparative experiments.

Emerging from fuzzy set theory, the first fuzzy time-series model by Song and Chissom in 1993 led to significant research advancements and applications. Efforts such as optimizing fuzzy time-series complexity, enhancing prediction accuracy, and developing models for linguistic prediction analysis have marked the progress in this field.

To accurately reflect the multifactorial nature of data sets, granular computing is employed. Granules, granular spaces, and hierarchy structures are its foundational elements, creating a system that addresses both certainty and uncertainty. Each IRI measurement factor becomes a granule, with different granules representing principal and subsidiary factors within defined granular spaces.

By simulating bird flocking behaviors, the PSO algorithm provides an intelligent method for global optimization, showing promise in solving numerous problem types. In this study, PSO is used to refine the IRI prediction model due to its intelligence, synergistic optimization capability, and demonstrated effectiveness in solving complex problems.

For this research, the process involves defining fuzzy sets for the main factors, fuzzifying historical data into those sets, and then using the data to perform IRI prediction experiments. Unlike conventional single-factor methods, the study's model considers multiple factors for predicting average IRI, leading to more accurate and reliable predictions.

A case study uses historical IRI data from a Florida road section and demonstrates the model's predictive capacity by employing data up to 2014 to estimate the 2015 IRI, which is then compared against actual values. When benchmarked against other methods, the proposed multigranularity fuzzy time-series approach yields the least error, proving its efficacy.
