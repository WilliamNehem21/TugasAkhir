The detailed algorithm is outlined in Section 6, with Section 7 discussing its application to different types of multimedia data and presenting the outcomes of several analytical tests. Section 8 offers the final words on the research.

An image consists of a matrix of pixels with varying values, ranging from 0 to 255 for each color channel in each pixel. In grayscale images, 1 byte or 8 bits is sufficient to represent one pixel. Various techniques exist for creating bitplanes, including Binary Bitplane Decomposition (BBD), Grey Code Bitplane Decomposition (GCBD), and Fibonacci P-Code Bitplane Decomposition (FBD).

Encryption methods have been developed, such as the work by Song et al., that employ chaotic logistic maps to scramble bitplanes and sustain the correlation in the upper bitplanes while still compressing the images. These utilize the BBD method, while other proposed algorithms use the Grey Code and Fibonacci P-Code bitplane decomposition techniques.

The encryption process is augmented by the application of a key-driven frame rotation to each bitplane independently. A frame is defined as a one-pixel-wide border around a bitplane, and these frames are rotated circularly in a clockwise direction to increase the unpredictability and complexity of the encryption.

This procedure is performed over three rounds, with each round decreasing the block size—from 64x64 to 32x32, and finally to 16x16 blocks—ultimately resulting in the retrieval of the original, decrypted image.

The time complexity, which is the time taken by the encryption algorithm to secure an image, generally increases with image size, making it proportional to the size of the image. This complexity impacts the encryption time recorded for different image sizes.

By integrating various methods, the RBF algorithm stands firm against numerous attacks. It is lossless, ensuring that the information within the image is fully recoverable after decryption. Moreover, the technique is versatile, working well with images of any dimension, and robust, finding practical use in everyday situations for encrypting a diverse array of images. An extensive evaluation and analysis of the RBF algorithm are detailed throughout the paper.
