LogiWeb is a system that allows logic researchers to publish their papers online. These publications feature excellent typographic quality and readability while also being verifiable by machines. Within these papers, authors can define formal theories, new concepts, programs, lemmas, conjectures, and proofs. Additionally, the papers can reference other works across the internet, facilitating proof verification across multiple documents worldwide. For example, a lemma in one paper may rely on a concept defined in another paper hosted elsewhere.

LogiWeb can be implemented as a standalone system or operate behind the scenes to support other systems such as Mizar. While the World Wide Web supports mathematics through MathML and OMDoc, those are more suited for constantly evolving information, while LogiWeb caters to permanently archived mathematical work.

The underlying data structures of LogiWeb include parsetrees that capture the structure of the pages stored in the system, codices which are databaselike representations of the parsetrees, symbols that denote concepts, and aspects allowing symbols to adapt to different contexts.

LogiWeb ensures the correctness of pages according to a default criterion, but authors can specify alternative criteria. Codices transform the mathematical contents into a format that's easily processed by LogiWeb's verification and programming interfaces. LogiWeb's programming language, based on a simple, untyped version of lambda calculus, allows for complex expressions and operations, though it starts at a lower-level foundation compared to some other systems.

Definitions within a page are synthesized into a single one for each symbol aspect; if multiple definitions exist and are identical, one is chosen, otherwise, a conflict is indicated. Claim aspects, however, are combined.

A page's correctness may also be evaluated by a custom criterion, such as the Mizar criterion. If a page meets such a criterion, its correctness remains constant over time, regardless of any updates to the supporting system.

Starting with LogiWeb requires a base page to introduce fundamental constructs, followed by the use of those constructs to define further elements and carry out research.

The LogiWeb protocol has three layers, where layer 0 deals with data storage, retrieval, and transfer; layer 1 unpacks pages into codices and involves page checking and rendering; whereas layers above are user-defined.

Communication between servers or between a server and a browser can occur over TCP, UDP, or similar protocols, with messages being sent through continuous streams or packets. The server responds appropriately with the required message type based on the requested content, and additional messages are employed for translating local filenames to references.

Finally, when browsers load pages, references and arities are converted from the original linear parsetree to a structured, tree format using codex information, and proclamations are processed into the system. If an error occurs during macroreduction, the browser flags the definition with an error mode.
