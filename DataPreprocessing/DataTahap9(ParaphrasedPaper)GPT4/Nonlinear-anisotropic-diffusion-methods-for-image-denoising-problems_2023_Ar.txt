Image acquisition, processing, and transmission can introduce various types of noise that adversely affect image quality. For example, defective pixels on a sensor can create random intensity spots, resulting in image noise such as salt-and-pepper, Gaussian, Poisson, shot, and speckle. This noise can be either additive or multiplicative, meaning it can be combined with the original image by either addition or multiplication.

While anisotropic diffusion has been effective for image denoising, its influence on other image processing tasks like compression, segmentation, inpainting, and tomography reconstruction has not been extensively studied. This presents an opportunity for research, particularly in incorporating anisotropic diffusion within neural networks to enhance learning.

A significant research challenge is to understand the mathematical relationships of signal features at different scales after diffusion. This understanding could illuminate why diffusion alters pixel distributions in images, leading to noise and artifact reduction. It may also enable development of methods to reverse the diffusion process to recover the original signal.

In the context of measuring image quality, two metrics are commonly used: PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and SSIM (Structural Similarity Index Measure). PSNR assesses the ratio of signal power to the power of noise disturbances, with higher values indicating better quality. However, PSNR does not fully capture human perception of image quality. SSIM, which ranges from 0 to 1, addresses this shortcoming by reflecting the human visual system, where higher values correspond to higher image quality.

A study compared various denoising methods, including those by Monteil and Beghdadi, Tebini et al., Gupta et al., Rezgui et al., and the authors of the paper. They quantified the quality of the denoised images using PSNR and SSIM. The implementation codes for these methods were made available for other researchers to replicate the findings.
