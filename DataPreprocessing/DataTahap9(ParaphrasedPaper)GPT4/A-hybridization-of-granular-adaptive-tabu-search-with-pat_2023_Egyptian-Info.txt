This academic paper presents a study on the multi-depot open vehicle routing problem (MDOVRP), a variation of the classic vehicle routing problem (VRP) characterized by the presence of multiple depots and the fact that vehicles are not required to return to a depot after serving the last customer. The authors introduce a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm named GATS-PR, which combines Granular Adaptive Tabu Search (GATS) with Path Relinking (PR). This work's significant contributions include: a novel solution-based Tabu Search technique in GATS, an adaptive method for selecting neighborhoods from a large set of 22 move types, and the first-time application of Path Relinking with a newly defined similarity metric to MDOVRP. The performance of GATS-PR surpasses existing state-of-the-art algorithms, achieving improved or equivalent results on 4 and 19 benchmark instances, respectively.

The structure of the paper is laid out as follows: Section 2 reviews related MDOVRP literature, Section 3 defines MDOVRP, Section 4 details the new GATS-PR algorithm, Section 5 reports on parameter tuning, computational results, and the significance of different algorithm components, and Section 6 concludes the paper.

Prior studies mentioned in the paper include a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) formulation of the MDOVRP solved using CPLEX, with advancements in subtour elimination and vehicle number constraints. Open location routing and heterogeneous fleet problems were also addressed in prior MIP models adapted for MDOVRP. Researchers have explored various algorithms like multi-start metaheuristics, iterative local search algorithms, and tabu search adapted for simultaneous scheduling and vehicle routing as they relate to MDOVRP.

A key point in the algorithm design was the construction of comprehensive neighborhoods involving 22 move types, categorized by their impact on the solution. This allows the algorithm to fine-tune the search process for better balance between solution improvement (intensification) and exploration (diversification).

Parameter tuning was performed on selected instances, prioritizing independence between local search procedures and the PR operator. A step-by-step approach was used to tune parameters individually while keeping others constant. This helped manage the complexity of parameter combinations and led to normalized results for varied instances.

The authors emphasize the superiority of GATS-PR over previous methods by highlighting its consistent performance across different stages of the search process in relation to alternative approaches. These results validate the importance of the Adaptive Neighborhood Selection (ANS) mechanism implemented.

Looking ahead, the authors aim to apply the GATS-PR algorithm to other VRP variants, such as the multi-depot VRP and the multi-depot green VRP. They also plan to investigate advanced population management strategies and develop alternative solution similarity definitions to further enhance the search capability of Path Relinking for MDOVRP solutions.
