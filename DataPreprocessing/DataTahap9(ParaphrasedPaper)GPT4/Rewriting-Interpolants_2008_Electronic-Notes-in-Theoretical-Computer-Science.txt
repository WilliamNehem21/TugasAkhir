In this academic excerpt, the focus is on the concept of an interpolant within the realm of logical formulas. An interpolant for two formulas a and b shares common symbols with both and serves as a logical bridge: it is logically entailed by a while it entails b. This concept, established by Craig in 1957, provides a way to understand the shared interaction between the formulas, effectively acting as an interface.

McMillan has recently demonstrated that interpolants offer significant practical utility in various aspects of verification such as identifying inductive invariants and assisting in predicate abstraction processes.

The paper goes on to discuss motivation for a specific kind of substitution used to manipulate the structure between formulas. The aim is to create shared structure while differentiating the treatment of inferences drawn from formulas a and b. Specifically, inferences from a involve a substitution that includes another element, i, while those from b avoid such substitution to exclude i. This method is designed to preserve a record of inferences from a within the interpolant, while excluding those from b, hence maintaining a relevant trace of inferences related to a.

When constraints from a are processed, a substitution variable v is introduced to encapsulate the entirety of the effect of a within the interpolant i. For constraints from b, although v is also used, it's correlated with an original, unchanged copy of the constraint, allowing for a record of actions related to that specific constraint without altering it.

The paper next addresses the need to simplify constraints after an inference has been applied, a common practice in constraint manipulation. It highlights potential complications that may arise after applying substitutions as part of an inference, as the substitution portion may not remain in its simplest form. An inference rule, termed the "simplify rule," is proposed to ensure the substitution part of a constraint is simplified proactively each time a new constraint is generated, to maintain consistency and clarity in the constraint's structure.
