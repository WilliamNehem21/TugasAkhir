This academic paper introduces a new framework for agent-based grid scheduling, emphasizing the framework's robustness, performance, efficiency, scalability, and ability to manage heterogeneous resources within a computational grid. The proposed framework, named Agent-Based Robust Grid Scheduling Framework, aims to provide a flexible, scalable, and adaptive grid infrastructure that facilitates dynamic composition of disparate resources. 

Agents are employed for their autonomy, intelligence, learning capabilities, and adaptability to changing grid environments. They offer services that are robust and scalable, making them suitable for grid scheduling. The paper discusses the two-stage grid scheduling process: selection of appropriate resources for job allocation, followed by the placement of jobs onto the selected resources for execution.

Numerous initiatives have attempted to enhance computational grid efficiency, such as Nimrod-G, which utilizes resource agents for job execution management and a central broker for resource discovery and trading. An Agent-Based Resource Management System (ARMS) is also mentioned, which involves agents representing local grid resources and providing high-performance computing services through service advertisement and discovery.

The paper acknowledges limitations such as lack of integration into grid toolkits, absence of real-time performance testing, and lack of support for dynamic scheduling. A novel approach called Ordinal Sharing Learning (OSL) for load balancing is introduced, but it does not tackle inter-task synchronization or dynamic scheduling robustness.

Other proposed solutions include integrating services and resources through adaptable agents with behavioral rules and employing economic models for resource allocation. The paper critiques current centralized agent-based systems as impractical for true grid environments, where resources are geographically distributed and independently owned.

The presented framework incorporates agents for different roles such as application partitioning, robustness assurance, and core grid management services. These include a task control agent, robustness agents, and agents that monitor tasks and resource status. The architecture seeks to manage uncertainties caused by fluctuations in resource availability, network bandwidth, and job demands.

Agent-based coordination is a noteworthy feature for task control, where multiple agents work together to offer robust scheduling by compensating for the failure of individual agents. The proposed framework aims to deliver jobs effectively and efficiently despite variations in jobs, resources, and network conditions, thanks to a multi-layered and hierarchical agent-based architecture designed to provide robustness in a grid scheduler.
