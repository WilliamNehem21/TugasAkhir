Digital medicine transforms the conventional medical paradigm through the use of the internet. It overcomes the constraints of time, space, and patient access, fostering a new, information-age compatible healthcare system that additionally enhances the management of medical records. The utility of electronic medical health records extends well beyond patient care, research, and education to include hospital administration, insurance processes, and legal evidence collection.

The paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 reviews related literature, Section 3 discusses problems associated with the secure sharing of electronic medical data, and Section 4 introduces the novel SSPM (Sanitizable Signature Privacy Model) designed to address these issues. Sections 5 and 6 offer in-depth security and performance analyses of the proposed model, and the conclusion is presented in the final section.

The concept of unlinkability, as defined by Brzuska et al., is a key privacy feature ensuring that no one except the signatory and sanitizer can learn anything about a sanitized signature if they know the original one. Pohls et al. introduced the idea of hidden attributes in a signed message, explaining that it should be obscure which parts of a message may be altered. While sanitizable signatures providing either invisibility or unlinkability exist, combining the two remains an open challenge.

The SSPM approach introduced in this paper successfully conceals a patient's sensitive information and maximizes privacy protection, all while permitting data integrity to be verified by sanitization. This ensures that the scheme is accountable.

As electronic medicine evolves and the use of medical records broadens, we realize the imperative nature of security and privacy in the sharing of medical data due to its sensitive content. Addressing these concerns, we propose a sanitizable signature model reliant on a trapdoor key and a key-exposure free chameleon hash function, which enables sanitized message processing through collision finding. Our analysis and evaluations reveal that the SSPM scheme effectively maintains medical data integrity and upholds patient privacy. Moreover, it supports public verification, reducing the computation burden for recipients and facilitating easier integration into electronic medical data sharing frameworks.
