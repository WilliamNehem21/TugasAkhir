In this study, during the training process, numeric feature values of MCCs (presumably microcalcifications in medical imaging) are used to adjust the neurons' weights and biases within an artificial neural network (ANN) to reduce the prediction error of the output neuron. The ideal architecture for these neural networks is not predetermined and can depend on various factors such as the number of hidden layers, neurons per layer, activation functions, learning algorithms, and training settings. The researchers have chosen the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to train a Multi-Layer Feed Forward Back Propagation ANN (MLFFBP-ANN) to distinguish between benign and malignant MCCs.

Additionally, Support Vector Machines (SVM) are employed, utilizing kernel functions that transform a non-linear classification problem into a linear one by projecting the input data into a higher-dimensional space. Subsequently, an optimal separating hyperplane is determined to segregate the two classes in this binary categorization problem.

The accuracy of the classifiers within a medical diagnostic context is also evaluated using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis. The ROC curve is constructed by plotting the True Positive Rate (sensitivity) against the False Positive Rate (1-specificity) at varying threshold levels. The area under the ROC curve provides a measure of the classification accuracy of the classifier.
