This study aims to understand the factors that affect organizational commitment among high-technology employees in Pakistan's IT sector, a topic that has not been thoroughly investigated in this specific context. The research specifically examines whether compensation alone can foster commitment, or if other elements also play a role, given that literature consistently links pay to organizational commitment. To explore these relationships, the authors distributed anonymous questionnaires to IT professionals via HR departments, achieving a 90% response rate from the 85 targeted employees.

Significantly, the study's findings support the notion that compensation, supervisor support, and training and development all contribute to organizational commitment. Respondents particularly valued performance feedback and recognition, indicating that these factors intrinsically motivate IT professionals and should not be overlooked by organizations. Moreover, the rapid technological advancements in the IT industry necessitate adequate and timely professional training to keep skills current.

The research confirms the first hypothesis that compensation is indeed significantly related to organizational commitment among Pakistan's IT sector employees. This reinforces the need for well-structured compensation packages to enhance commitment. Additionally, the study suggests that organizations should offer robust support and training opportunities to maintain their competitive edge by having committed, well-informed, and motivated IT professionals.
