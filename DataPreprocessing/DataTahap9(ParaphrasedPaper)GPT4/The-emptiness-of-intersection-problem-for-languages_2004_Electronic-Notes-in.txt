The academic paper discusses categorial grammars in the field of natural language processing, specifically focusing on classical categorial grammars and Lambek categorial grammars, which are related to linear logic. These grammars are lexical, meaning they assign types or categories to words in the language. They are referred to as k-valued if each word is limited to k types, and as rigid if they are 1-valued. K-valued grammars are under active investigation due to their relevance in learning theory. A solid comprehension of these grammars' characteristics is crucial.

Classical categorial grammars consist of a finite set of relations between a vocabulary and a set of types. If a grammar assigns type 'a' to word 'c', it is noted as g: c â†’ a. The paper also defines how to identify the subtypes assigned within the grammar.

The paper has dealt with the decidability issue around whether it's possible to determine if the intersection of two languages generated by two separate k-valued classical categorial grammars, or two separate k-valued Lambek grammars, is empty. The paper demonstrates that this problem is undecidable for each class by introducing and discussing properties of a specific class of grammars named pcp-grammars, which are a subset of unidirectional grammars. This undecidability indicates that determining the emptiness of the intersection between two languages produced by these grammars is a non-trivial problem.
