This paper explores the application of deep learning in agriculture, specifically using pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect and categorize diseases in paddy crops based on field images. The research compares several leading CNN architectures—Inception-V3, VGG-16, ResNet-50, DenseNet-121, and MobileNetV2—all utilizing transfer learning with ImageNet pre-trained weights. The focus is on three major and damaging paddy diseases: brown spot, hispa, and leaf blast, particularly during the flowering and ripening stages. Results show that the ResNet-50 model excelled with the highest classification accuracy at 92.61%, suggesting CNNs are effective for identifying paddy crop diseases and could aid non-specialists through automated methods.
