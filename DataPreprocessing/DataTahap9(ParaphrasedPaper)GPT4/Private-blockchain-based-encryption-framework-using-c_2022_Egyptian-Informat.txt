This paper reviews the use of computational intelligence (CI) strategies in bolstering the security of Internet of Things (IoT) systems. CI techniques have been widely applied in critical areas like malware identification, threat hunting, activity monitoring, intrusion prevention, and cyberattack detection, which have the potential to enhance the cybersecurity of IoT devices, applications, and protect user data.

The paper acknowledges the complexities of integrating blockchain technology, which offers decentralized security, with security approaches. Although substantial research has delved into blockchain for security, few have proposed concrete frameworks. Thus, the need for research into blockchain-enabled security framework models that incorporate CI security measures is significant.

A novel blockchain-based encryption framework that uses CI is proposed, aimed at safeguarding sensitive healthcare information and ensuring private communication channels among users, database providers, and data owners. The framework employs blockchain as a decentralized method to disperse resources and manage data securely in cloud storage, providing a safer user experience.

The paper highlights a smart contract and attribute-based encryption (ABE) data-sharing strategy that relies on blockchain, which permits revocation of user access based on attributes and establishes a single managing agent responsible for encoding and decoding data. However, this centralization poses a risk to user data security and could collapse completely if the key management center fails.

The authors touch on the challenges of implementing a blockchain framework within IoT, particularly in industrial contexts, where maintaining security is paramount. Despite the hurdles, blockchain remains promising in addressing security, privacy, and trust in applications that involve multiple stakeholders.

Moreover, the study investigated how blockchain privacy can be reinforced to protect confidentiality in IoT devices, highlighting zero-knowledge proofs as a method for mitigating privacy invasion risks.

In the framework, once data patterns are trained and meet set criteria, they are uploaded to the cloud for future prediction tasks. If a disease is predicted, the system will notify the user; otherwise, it will halt if no disease is detected.

The paper concludes with findings from simulations of a private blockchain-based encryption framework integrated with CI. The results show that the framework scales effectively with growing data sets and that using a substantial amount of training data improves performance. The security system demonstrates high detection accuracy with rates of 0.93 in the training phase and 0.91 in the validation phase, which are superior to those of previously reported systems.
