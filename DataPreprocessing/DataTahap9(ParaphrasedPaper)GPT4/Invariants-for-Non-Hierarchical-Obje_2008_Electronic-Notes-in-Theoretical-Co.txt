This academic paper discusses the use of invariants in object-oriented (OO) program specification and how they lead to enhanced code flexibility, reduced specification overhead, and clearer separation of concerns. Invariants enforce data consistency and behavioral properties, and their use allows for the abstraction of class data.

The paper highlights the importance of "feasible" specifications, which are those that can be implemented and verified. It introduces a specification construct called "inc," which allows methods to specify preservation of invariants without depending on them. This is particularly useful in non-local OO design patterns, where non-hierarchical relationships between objects can make invariant management complex.

A practical example is provided where a `Book` object's `loanedTo` property must be updated—a process that normally requires the invariants to be maintained. The "inc" construct enables greater flexibility here by allowing updates without reestablishing the invariants.

The authors also address the concept of information hiding, an essential design principle in OO development. They argue most OO designs are infeasible unless invariants are properly managed. A proof system complements this approach by ensuring program correctness and meeting the premises of theorem 3.1, which allows for the assumption of invariant validity during method calls.

Furthermore, a "coop" construct is introduced to specify how field assignments may interact with invariants, ensuring that assignments do not invalidate uncooperative invariants.

The paper also touches on the use of abstract fields and invariants for design abstraction, allowing for more flexible implementation across subclasses.

Integration of these concepts, along with the introduction of proof obligations, ensures that proper verification can take place, allowing methods to rely on invariants without having them specified in pre- and postconditions. The authors claim this approach is essential for verification of many natural OO designs, especially those that are non-hierarchical, and is suitable for modular development of classes.

Overall, the constructs introduced—namely "inc" and "coop"—along with the proof obligations developed, offer a new way to manage invariants in OO programming, thus enabling more robust and maintainable code.
