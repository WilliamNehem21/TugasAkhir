The Radio Block Center (RBC) is an integral component of the Chinese Train Control System Level 3 (CTCS-3), which serves as a protocol for systems critical to safety. The accuracy of the RBC handover protocol is a vital aspect that influences the safety of these systems. Consequently, it's essential to validate the protocol's correctness. In this study, we employed Modeling, Simulation, and Verification Language (MSVL) to model and confirm the protocol's accuracy. Our findings indicate that the RBC handover's operations align with its specifications.

This research received backing from several Chinese national research initiatives and funding bodies, including the 973 Program and the National Natural Science Foundation of China, thanks to a series of grants.

The structure of the paper is as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of the MSV toolkit for MSVL. Section 3 outlines the RBC handover protocol. Sections 4 and 5 are dedicated to the modeling, simulation, and verification of the protocol. The paper concludes with Section 6.

There are two scenarios considered for RBC handover: one involving handover with two functioning radio stations and the other with only one. We place emphasis on the latter scenario, denoting the handing-over RBC as RBC1 and the receiving RBC as RBC2.
