This paper presents a specialized recursion scheme based on comonad constructions for the initial algebra of a functor f, applying it specifically to the cofree recursive comonad on f. This advanced recursion scheme enables recursive calls on structurally smaller elements and additional subsidiary recursions, going beyond what is allowed in schemes based solely on the cofree comonad on f.

A novel aspect of this work is the Mendler-style formulation of the recursion scheme, which employs a generalized Yoneda Lemma for initial algebras. This lemma involves strong dinaturality, and the authors suggest its relevance to circular proof concepts as proposed by Cockett and Santocanale, although they plan to address this application more fully in a future paper.

The paper begins with a review of existing comonad-based recursion schemes and their application to cofree comonads. The authors then detail the instantiation to the cofree recursive comonad, describe a Haskell implementation of the combinators, and outline the potential connection between the Mendler-style scheme and circular proofs.

A significant contribution of the paper is showing that the cofree recursive comonad provides a meaningful instance of a comonad-based recursion scheme, which facilitates subsidiary recursions. The authors discuss the intuition behind this scheme and its resemblance to course-of-value iteration, gaining insights into how this recursion allows processing of a data structure that contains the results of the main recursion.

While the authors acknowledge challenges, such as Haskell's limitations in fully enforcing functor and comonad laws and the language's non-totality, they offer guidance for safely using Haskell within certain constraints to avoid these issues, focusing on initial algebras and final coalgebras.

The paper concludes by situating the research in the context of previous work by Hagino, Cockett, Spencer, Uustalu, Vene, Pardo, Bartels, and Capretta. These pioneers developed programming techniques using categorical combinators for inductive and coinductive types and investigated various recursion and coinduction principles. This study builds upon foundational research, showcasing that the scheme extends from initial algebras to any coalgebras as defined by Osius, while offering a potent tool for managing recursive programming structures and potentially engaging with the phenomenon of circular proofs.
