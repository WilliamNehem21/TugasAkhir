An advancement in modeling time-varying dynamic systems is presented through a modified version of timed P systems. This new model encompasses a timed automaton with discrete time where each automaton state represents a different timed P system, permitting evolution rules to evolve over time. An investigation into the expressive capabilities of this extended formalism has been conducted, affirming its ability to completely characterize dynamics, with an illustrative application detailed for an ecological system.

Various adaptations of P systems have been introduced to enhance their modeling power, integrating different evolutionary strategies and features like dissolution rules (enabling a membrane's disappearance and release of its contents), priority rules (establishing precedence among evolutionary rules within a membrane), and modifiers such as promoters and inhibitors (controlling the applicability of rules based on the presence or absence of specific objects). Although initially conceived for computational modeling inspired by biological processes, P systems have found applications in biological system modeling, including biomolecular and, more recently, ecological systems, such as population dynamics of certain species.

The proposed extension allows for dynamic evolution rule alteration in response to changing environmental conditions. By linking timed automaton locations to environmental states like seasons, the model can reflect varied population dynamics accordingly. Moreover, by inserting or removing objects within the outer membrane, the model can simulate shifts in population makeup due to environmental changes.

While related work has introduced content-timed P systems with variable rule execution times contingent on system state, the novel timed P automata enable complete rule redefinition dependent on temporal progression. During an evolution step in a timed P system, rules apply solely to objects within the same membrane and specify target locations for new objects created by rule application, ensuring precise object placement within the system's hierarchical structure.

As a computational example, the system calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers by timing the synchronized appearance of two objects within a membrane, with the LCM corresponding to the duration until their first simultaneous occurrence. The model's transitions also involve clock resets and the addition of new objects to the system's outer membrane, setting up updated rules and restarting time for continued evolution.

The formal description of timed P automata includes clock variables (with natural number valuations), nondeterministic operations without a probabilistic frameworkâ€”although future enhancements may incorporate probabilities for a more accurate and realistic biological representation.

To demonstrate the model's application, a specific ecological example is outlined with different classes of female individuals exhibiting disparate fecundity rates and survival probabilities for offspring and adults, showcasing the model's adaptability in encapsulating complex biological systems.

In summary, this development of time-variant timed P systems offers a robust tool for analyzing dynamic systems, especially ecological ones, with a proven capacity for comprehensive system characterization.
