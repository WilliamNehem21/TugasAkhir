This paper addresses the challenge of vehicle re-identification (re-ID), which is the task of identifying the same vehicle across diverse scenes, a crucial aspect of image retrieval. Due to varying surveillance camera positions, vehicle images may face issues like occlusions, motion blur, and different angles, making it difficult to correctly re-identify a vehicle.

The authors propose a multi-fine-grained feature extraction network that maintains a vehicle's overall information while precisely extracting fine-grained features, achieved by segmenting the vehicle feature map. This method ensures better discrimination of the vehicle’s details, despite obstacles and varying viewpoints. Moreover, the study introduces a novel metric, Mean Inverse Negative Penalty (MINP), to provide a more comprehensive assessment of vehicle re-ID models.

The proposed approach and metric were tested on three challenging vehicle datasets – VeRi-776, VehicleID, and VRIC – and demonstrated superior accuracy over existing state-of-the-art methods. The authors detail their multi-fine-grained feature extraction network, the new evaluation metric, and their experimental results and analysis. They conclude by accentuating the effectiveness of their network and the added significance of the MINP metric in assessing vehicle re-ID performance.
