In Section 4, the paper builds upon previous work on topological-sheaf semantics by expanding its application to broader neighborhood structures using the approach labeled as (a). By using consistent notation and types of semantic structures, the authors successfully extend the concept of a sheaf, which traditionally applied only to topological spaces, to a wider range of neighborhood structures. This extension allows the new semantics to encompass the previously understood neighborhood semantics with fixed domains, now seen as a specific case of constant sheaves, pursuant to point (d). Additionally, this new sheaf-oriented framework is comprehensive enough to include Kripke-sheaf semantics because Kripke sheaves can be viewed as special instances of neighborhood sheaves characterized by relational accessibility. In essence, neighborhood-sheaf semantics on the sheaf conceptual level amalgamate and standardize both topological-sheaf semantics (via a) and Kripke-sheaf semantics (via b), just as neighborhood semantics harmonizes topological and Kripke semantics at the propositional level.

In subsection 2.1, the shared aspects of Kripke, topological, and neighborhood semantics for propositional modal logic are explored. Continuing in this vein for first-order logic, the paper discusses how traditional possible-world semantics operates with a set X for propositional modal logic; this approach is extended to interpret first-order modal logic by considering the category Sets/X as the collection of sets indexed by X.

For propositional modal logic within topological semantics, the interpretation is based on adding both a topology and the operation int to a set X containing possible worlds. When expanding this framework to first-order modal logic, topological-sheaf semantics are employed, which involves incorporating topologies and int operations onto the structures examined in subsection 3.1, specifically Sets over X. In practical terms, this entails utilizing objects, products, and arrows not just in Sets/|X| but in Sh/X, the sheaf category over a topological space X, to interpret first-order modal logic.
