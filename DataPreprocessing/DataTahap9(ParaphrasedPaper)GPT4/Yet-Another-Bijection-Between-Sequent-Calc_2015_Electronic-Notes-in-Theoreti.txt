In this section, we broaden the scope of the correlations established in the earlier section to encompass derivations that are non-normal in natural deduction (ND) and the sequent calculus LJT inclusive of cut rules. Due to constraints on the length of the text, we are unable to include the formal proofs. Nevertheless, we trust that the description provided herein will suffice to give the reader insight into the workings of the isomorphism we've discovered between LJT and ND.
