This abstract presents a new image authentication method which incorporates Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) and Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) based iris recognition along with a reversible watermarking technique. This novel approach uses Integer Wavelet Transform (IWT) and threshold embedding for inserting the LDPC parity checks and parity matrix, as well as SHA-512 hashed iris codes, into an image. Because this watermarking process is reversible, all embedded data, as well as the original image, can be recovered by reversing the embedding steps. 

The authentication works by comparing the extracted hash value from the watermarked image with a new hash generated from a live person's corrected iris code. The LDPC coding is particularly effective at increasing the difference, or Hamming distance, for genuine comparisons as opposed to impostor comparisons, which enhances the overall authentication accuracy.

An additional security layer comes from the SHA-512's complexity, making it highly resistant to a type of cryptographic attack known as the birthday attack. The paper reports experimental results indicating that this new method yields more accurate authentication with low false rejection or acceptance rates while outperforming existing solutions in terms of Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR).

The embedding of iris data in the form of cancellable biometrics ensures secrecy without compromising the image quality, as the data embedding is not perceptible to the naked eye. The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 details the lossless data hiding technique, Section 3 describes the enrollment process of the system, Section 4 explains the verification or authentication process, Section 5 provides experimental results and performance analysis, and Section 6 offers the conclusion. 

The paper also addresses the challenges of ensuring consistent iris image dimensions, which are crucial for accurate comparisons, highlighting the influence of pupil dilation, varying imaging distances, and rotations of the camera or eye. An example from Section 3 showcases the LDPC encoding method, while an LDPC decoding scenario is described to illustrate how original iris codes can be recovered for authentication purposes.
