In this study, the authors investigate different reasoning strategies for programs that handle data structures defined by set-valued abstract fields connected to container objects. They evaluate the expressiveness and complexity of several specification languages, including those based on decidable prefix classes of first-order logic, two-variable logic with counting, and the Nelson-Oppen technique for combining multisorted theories. These specification logics are useful for verifying object-oriented programs that include provided invariants. Furthermore, by choosing a particular set of properties that can be expressed in these logics, decision procedures inherent in the logics can be used to automate the calculation of lattice operations in abstract interpretation domains and to automate the computation of abstract program semantics.

The paper addresses challenges that arise when instances of different data types, each implemented using multiple dynamically allocated objects, are created during the execution of a program. To analyze such programs, abstract set-valued fields are used as specification variables to describe abstract data type operations. The analysis is divided into two parts: 1) verifying that the data type implementation is correct according to the set specification, and 2) verifying the rest of the program where linked data structures are replaced by abstract set fields.

A central idea in the HOB project is the simplification of reasoning about programs with complex data structures by specifying data structure operations with abstract object sets. This approach breaks the verification process into two tasks: ensuring the data structure matches the specification with abstract set variables, and using the same variables to analyze the data structure's behavior in the remainder of the program. So far, the focus has been on verifying global data structures instantiated at compile-time, which allows the use of decidable boolean algebra theory to reason about the structures. Extending this method to dynamically instantiated data structures is an ongoing research goal.

Dynamic instantiation, a common feature in object-oriented languages, associates each data type instance with an object linked to the underlying data structure. This study suggests extending HOB to verify programs using dynamically instantiated linked data structures by specifying them with a finite number of set-valued object fields.

The paper's core concern is verifying programs that manipulate objects with set-valued fields, focusing on specifications expressed in these terms and deriving a decision procedure for the constraints. The authors' method uses assume/guarantee reasoning with user-supplied annotations to separate class implementation analysis from the context analysis. This differs from other approaches that often infer approximations for both context and implementation.

To facilitate automated reasoning about programs with set-valued fields, the study explores decision procedures for constraints on such fields, encompassing relationships between sets tied to the same object, object reference aliasing, and relationships between sets associated with different objects. By annotating programs with these constraints and using a verification condition generator, developers can check various invariants in object-oriented programs. Selecting a suitable subset of properties to express using the constraints allows an analysis to automatically derive lattice operations in abstract interpretation domains and compute abstract program semantics.
