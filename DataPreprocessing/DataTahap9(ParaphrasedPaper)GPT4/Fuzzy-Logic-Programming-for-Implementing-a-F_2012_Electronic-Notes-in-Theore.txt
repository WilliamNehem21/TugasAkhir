XPath, a querying language, enables users to select nodes, or tags, and attributes within an XML tree by applying boolean conditions that pertain to the content within these elements. To use XPath effectively, one must be acquainted with the XML schema, but it's possible that users may not have access to this schema. Additionally, XML documents adhering to the same schema can exhibit a considerable divergence in their structural organization. Consider, for instance, XML-based CVs: despite a common schema, the organization of information, such as education, job history, or training details, could vary based on factors like chronology, relevance, or the depth of detail.

To address the limitations of XPath and provide greater querying flexibility, recent studies have explored enhancements to the XPath language. Notable advancements include the introduction of fuzzy constraints for content ('close' and 'similar') and structure ('below' and 'near') of nodes, along with a 'deep-similar' concept for tree matching. A fuzzy set theory approach has been utilized to rank answers, assigning a numerical value reflective of a retrieval status value (RSV) to each answer. Another proposal in this body of work is the consideration of a satisfaction degree for XPath expressions that assigns varying degrees of importance to nodes, aiming to return the top 'k' best-matching answers. Both approaches allow users to indicate a preferred level of specificity or leniency in the query results.

The paper is structured with Section 2 introducing the fuzzy XPath extension, and Section 3 detailing MALP and the FLOPER environment along with their integration with the fuzzy XPath. Section 4 discusses implementation challenges, and Section 5 concludes with a look at future work.
