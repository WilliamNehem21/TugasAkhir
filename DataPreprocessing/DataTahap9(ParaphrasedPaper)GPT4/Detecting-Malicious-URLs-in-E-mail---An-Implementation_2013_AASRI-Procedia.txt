The paper discusses how the proliferation of the internet facilitates quick and easy exchange of information. However, this comes with risks, such as identity theft and fraud, where cybercriminals exploit personal data for financial gain. Phishing is a common tactic, employing seemingly legitimate emails with deceptive links designed to pilfer sensitive information, such as usernames, account numbers, and passwords. Spam emails can evolve into phishing attempts, and spoofing is a prevalent technique where the attacker masquerades as a trusted source to trick users into revealing private details. These fraudulent emails may bypass content filters by having a seemingly empty body with only a malicious URL.

To counter this, the paper proposes a method to detect malicious URLs in emails by using a reduced set of features. A key indicator is the age of a domain hosting a suspicious website. Newer domains are more likely to be involved in cybercrime. The paper describes using WHOIS lookups to determine domain registration dates. If WHOIS servers don't have a record of the domain, or the domain sends a high volume of emails soon after registration, it is flagged as suspicious.
