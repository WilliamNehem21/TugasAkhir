This academic paper examines the role of adipose tissue in regulating insulin sensitivity via circulating proteins known as adipocytokines, including leptin, resistin, and adiponectin. Adiponectin, in particular, is implicated in the pathogenesis of obesity, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and cardiovascular diseases, with lower levels (hypoadiponectinemia) being a contributing factor. This study focused on the impact of Brazilian propolis, a substance collected by bees, on adiponectin levels in rats with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

The researchers induced T2DM in male Wistar rats with a high-fat diet and a low dose of streptozotocin (STZ, 35 mg/kg, i.p.). Propolis was then administered orally. They investigated various aspects including weight loss associated with diabetes, the impact on lipid metabolism, insulin resistance, oxidative stress, and specifically how propolis treatment affected these parameters.

The results indicated that while STZ-induced T2DM led to rapid weight loss due to factors like dehydration and muscle wasting, rats treated with propolis did not experience a significant increase in body weight, suggesting better control of the hyperglycemic state. Furthermore, propolis treatment appeared to alleviate disturbances in lipid metabolism typically seen in untreated diabetic rats, reducing triglycerides and LDL while increasing HDL levels.

For insulin resistance, a key feature of T2DM, propolis treatment reduced the resistance and fasting plasma glucose levels, pointing to its potential as an anti-hyperglycemic agent. Additionally, it appeared to lessen oxidative stress in diabetic rats by decreasing malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and restoring glutathione (GSH) levels.

Most notably, the study found that propolis treatment restored the reduced adiponectin levels in diabetic rats. Since adiponectin is associated with a lower risk of T2DM due to its anti-diabetic and anti-atherogenic effects, its restoration by propolis suggests promising therapeutic potential. 

In summary, the work presents Brazilian propolis as a beneficial compound that may positively influence adiponectin levels and through that, possibly contribute to managing obesity and T2DM, and its complications.
