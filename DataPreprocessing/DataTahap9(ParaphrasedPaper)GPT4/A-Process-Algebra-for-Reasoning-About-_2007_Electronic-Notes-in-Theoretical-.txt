This academic paper discusses the development of a process algebra aimed at defining quantum security properties within security protocols involving multiple agents operating in parallel. These agents carry out computations that are bounded by quantum polynomial time and exchange information encoded in qubits. Drawing inspiration from previous works, the paper addresses how the unique attributes of quantum information exchange, such as the constraints imposed by the non-cloning theorem, affect the design of the process algebra. The non-cloning theorem stipulates that quantum information cannot be duplicated unless its state is already known, necessitating clear rules to determine which agent holds particular qubits at any time.

The commands defined in the paper, aside from the 'measure' command, are deterministic. The 'measure' command, however, introduces randomness due to the probabilistic nature of quantum measurements. The authors only consider measurements in the computational basis, which they argue is not a limitation since measurements in other bases can be achieved through unitary transformations followed by computational basis measurements.

A framework called a quantum polynomial machine is introduced, which consists of a quantum RAM (QRAM) command, a polynomial that bounds the steps taken, and a polynomial determining the output. Emulation is used as a means to determine if a process successfully performs a cryptographic task by comparing it to an ideal process known to execute the task correctly.

The concept of security is explored through the capabilities of an 'ideal adversary', who cannot corrupt a process, versus a 'real adversary', a local process that could potentially act maliciously. The goal is to ensure that a well-behaved process is indistinguishable to the agent from a process interacting with an ideal adversary, thus ensuring that the well-behaved process emulates secure behavior.

The paper also touches on the properties of interactive proof systems, completeness, and soundness, ensuring that verifiers can confidently differentiate true assertions from false ones.

A notion of quantum zero-knowledge is presented, meaning that a verifier cannot distinguish interacting with a specific process from interacting with a '0' process, emphasizing the composability of quantum zero-knowledge.

The contributions of this paper include formulating a process algebra for quantum security protocols, incorporating quantum polynomial-time computation for agents using a logarithm cost QRAM, and managing quantum information via qubits' partitioning among agents. The paper establishes a foundation for reasoning about security protocols in the quantum computing context.
