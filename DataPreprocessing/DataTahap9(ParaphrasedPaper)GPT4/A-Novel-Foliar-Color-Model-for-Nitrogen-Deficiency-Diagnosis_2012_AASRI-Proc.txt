The paper discusses the challenges of detecting nitrogen deficiency in rubber tree leaves based on their color patterns, which tend to vary uniformly under stress. Traditional approaches using average values or relative color components are problematic due to linear correlations among the color components and the lack of a precise metric for mineral content. The authors propose a new color model that combines relative and absolute color components, taking into account the vague nature of nutrient descriptions. They introduce a novel metric, the slope angle, to evaluate the model's fit.

Previous research has attempted to correlate leaf color with nitrogen content using SPAD devices, but findings were not accurate enough to inform adaptive fertilization for rubber trees. The paper builds on previous work to create a more advanced model for nutrient diagnosis.

Various expressions derived from leaf color components have been proposed in literature to estimate nitrogen levels, but results have been unsatisfactory. The paper highlights that different color features correlate with nitrogen content at different times. It also considers issues like shape and color distortions from imaging errors, referencing calibration methods from other studies, such as Noh et al.'s real-time nitrogen deficiency detection calibration during fertilization.

The paper argues it is more reasonable to use a vague index to describe the nitrogen status and then measure it with another index to outline the relationship between the color model and nitrogen status. The authors find that the slope angle of distribution regions serves as a measurement to evaluate whether the color model is suitable for diagnosing nitrogen content. Experimental results suggest that this measurement allows for the convenient recognition of a better color model, including the one proposed by the authors.
