The paper discusses the exploration and development of a particular set of constructive description logics, focusing on their relevance to specific domains such as natural language semantics or legal artificial intelligence. Description logics are a class of logics used for representing and reasoning with knowledge, and they are typically chosen to balance expressiveness with computational tractability. Among various systems, ALC (attributive language with complements) is recognized as a standard form. Description logics are composed of concepts, roles, and individuals, analogous to unary and binary predicates in classical first-order logic.

The authors focus on a constructive version of ALC informed by intuitionistic logic, called IALC (intuitionistic ALC), drawing on foundational work in constructive modal logics by Simpson. This version is notable for its ability to represent incomplete information and context-dependent meaning, which is particularly useful in legal AI, where information may be incomplete or evolve over time.

Mendler and Scheele previously proposed a system called CALC, but in this paper, the authors follow a different approach using the IALC. They argue that the use of intuitionistic logic in legal reasoning allows for a more nuanced treatment of concepts, moving away from the binary truth values assumed in classical logic to a more dynamic conception that better suits the refinement and evolution of legal concepts.

Furthermore, the authors have practical ambitions for implementing IALC, IK (intuitionistic Kripke-style modal logic), and IHL systems, specifically aiming at applications in the engineering of legal knowledge systems. They plan to further study the relationship between systems based on IK and CK logics and their semantic models. The ultimate goal is to create a proof framework that can be used in these systems, with a focus on aiding the development of legal AI systems. The potential of their approach to simplify modeling while being easy to implement is yet to be determined, as their current project is in its early stages.
