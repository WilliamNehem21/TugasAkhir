The methods discussed previously have been integrated into the termination analysis tool mu-term. We conducted benchmarks to assess their performance using examples from the 2007 Termination Problem Database (TPDB, version 4.0).

Our findings suggest that applying Corollary 4.3 to demonstrate the innermost termination of rewrite systems may not be advantageous with the examples we tested. This approach led to a loss of some examples because of a more restrictive replacement map and did not improve the average computation time. When applying these concepts to cycles, we noticed marginal improvements but missed some additional examples.

Please note that to maintain the academic context and terminology, the paraphrasing still includes specific references like "Corollary 4.3" which might require consulting the original text for full comprehension.
