Active learning (AL) is a specialized area within machine learning (ML) focused on efficiently training models by interactively choosing the most informative samples from unlabeled data for expert annotation. This approach aims to minimize labeling costs while enhancing the model's performance. Warmuth et al. are credited with pioneering the application of AL to drug discovery. Their work established the suitability of AL for tackling labeling tasks in drug research and development. With the rise in the accuracy of ML models, interest in AL for drug discovery has surged, showing promise in various areas such as the creation of focused libraries, the reasoned design of novel drugs from scratch, and the optimization of drug combinations over the past twenty years.

Recent studies demonstrate AL's potential as a tool for drug discovery, supporting scientists in making molecular decisions and planning experiments. AL has a proven track record, suggesting its viability as a readily implementable technology in drug research contexts.

The role of AL extends beyond guiding labeling in ongoing research; it is also valuable for analyzing existing labeled datasets retrospectively. This retrospective analysis using AL can achieve several objectives. Firstly, it allows for the rapid evaluation of different model frameworks and AL querying strategies, enabling the optimization of AL processes before these are applied to more expensive, forward-looking studies. Secondly, when AL is applied to labeled datasets, it can act as a filtration mechanism by identifying and eliminating data that are redundant and no longer provide additional insights to the trained ML model. Lastly, there is evidence that the subset of training data selected by AL tends to be balanced, even if the original dataset is highly skewed, hinting at AL's potential utility as a method for balancing datasets.
