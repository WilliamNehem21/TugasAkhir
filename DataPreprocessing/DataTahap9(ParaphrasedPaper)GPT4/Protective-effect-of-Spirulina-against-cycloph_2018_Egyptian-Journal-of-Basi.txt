Cyclophosphamide (CP) is widely used to treat a range of cancers, such as lymphoma, leukemia, and multiple myeloma, as well as autoimmune conditions like rheumatoid arthritis. However, CP is known to cause serious side effects, including hemorrhagic cystitis (HC), which is an acute inflammation of the bladder. The toxic effects are largely due to acrolein, a byproduct of CP metabolism, which binds with cellular proteins and DNA, causing oxidative stress and depletion of cellular antioxidants.

Glutathione (GSH) is the most prevalent intracellular antioxidant and plays a crucial role in protecting cells from oxidative damage by reducing hydrogen peroxide and limiting the formation of harmful hydroxyl radicals. For the study in question, CP was administered intraperitoneally to mice, while Spirulina platensis (SP), a herbal medicine with various reported pharmacological benefits, was dissolved and given orally.

The experiment lasted nine days, after which the mice were euthanized, and blood samples were collected for biochemical analysis. Findings from the study indicate that SP has a protective effect against CP-induced urotoxicity. Mice pre-treated with SP showed significantly lower levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), a marker of oxidative stress, compared to those treated only with CP, suggesting that SP countered oxidative damage. Moreover, SP pre-treatment prevented CP-induced histopathological changes in the bladder.

The study also observed that SP increased the levels of essential nutrients zinc (Zn) and selenium (Se), which are crucial for immune function and healing. In addition, SP treatment improved several hematological parameters (such as hemoglobin, red and white blood cell count, and platelet count) that were affected by CP treatment. Results imply that SP not only counters toxicity in CP-treated mice but could potentially mitigate the effects of other chemotherapeutics with similar mechanisms.

In conclusion, the study supports the potential use of SP as a dietary supplement to reduce the adverse effects of CP and other medication and to boost the immune system in individuals receiving drug treatment. This could have positive implications for people receiving CP, as SP's antioxidant and anti-apoptotic properties could help to protect against HC and bladder damage.
