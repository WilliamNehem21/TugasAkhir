The study focuses on the enzymatic degradation abilities of microorganisms to break down synthetic dyestuffs, which are environmental pollutants in aquatic systems. Two bacterial strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, designated ASU3 and ASU6, were found to be capable of degrading Disperse Blue 64 (DB64) and Acid Yellow 17 (AY17), both synthetic dyes known to pollute water. The study also observed the strains' azoR1 gene expression, which is related to the degradation process.

ASU6 displayed higher degradation percentages for DB64 and AY17 compared to ASU3, which was attributed to differing levels of azoR1 gene expression between the two strains, as verified via RT-PCR. Furthermore, ASU6 exhibited greater azoreductase enzyme activity when tested with different substrates, such as Methyl Red (MR), DB64, and AY17. Enzyme kinetics of azoreductase were studied to optimize conditions for maintaining enzyme stability.

The degradation by-products, following separation by HPLC/MS, were tested for potential toxicity on two crop plants and found to be non-toxic. These crops were wheat (Triticum aestivum), a monocot, and broad bean (Vicia faba), a dicotâ€”both significant in Egyptian agriculture.

An acute toxicity experiment involved centrifuging dye-degraded broths and filtering the supernatant to obtain a sterile solution for plant seed germination.

Previous research on Pseudomonas decolorization capabilities showed many dyes being degraded above 90%, including Acid Violet 7, Acid Red 151, and Reactive Black 5, while others like Indigo carmine, Acid Red 183, and various anthraquinone dyes showed less degradation. A P. luteola bacteria culture was successful in reducing the azo bond in Red G from wastewater, demonstrating effective decolorization.

Different substrates were used to evaluate their impact on the azoreductase gene transcription. The azoR1 gene expression showed activity in ASU3 and ASU6 strains against azo dyes. The gene's expression coincided with the levels of azoreductase activity and the degradation rates, except for DB64, suggesting other factors might enhance enzyme action.

ASU6 demonstrated a higher km (Michaelis constant) and Vmax (maximum velocity) compared to ASU3 in enzyme kinetics, suggesting that ASU3's azoreductase might operate more efficiently at lower substrate concentrations.

The differential dye degradation rates between the strains ASU3 and ASU6 implied that Anthraquinone dyes like DB64 might be more readily degradable than azo dyes, or the complex structure of AY17 could hinder its breakdown. This difference could also be due to varying bacterial azoR1 gene expressions in the presence of DB64 versus AY17.
