The paper discusses an SoC (system-on-chip) that centralizes around a DW8051 IP core optimized for superior performance compared to the classic 8051 microcontroller. The modern core can process instructions in just 4 clock cycles, compared to the original's 12. This updated microcontroller also handles various functionalities through its special function registers (SFRs), including a MAC (medium access control) layer, SPI (serial peripheral interface), ADC (analog-to-digital converter) interface, and other digital components.

The SoC incorporates two blocks of SRAM: one with a capacity of 4KB and another with 256B. The 4KB SRAM is utilized for the software, which does not exceed this size, while the 256B SRAM is presumably tailored for the specific demands of the recognition task. Upon startup, the system goes through initialization, running a bootloader that transfers software from an EEPROM chip to the SoC's 4KB SRAM.

A critical element of the SoC is its FIFO (first-in-first-out) memory, designed to buffer data and manage data flow between different timings (clock domains). The FIFO in question uses a 6-bit pointer for writing to 32 locations and a 4-bit pointer for reading from 8 locations, enabling it to manage full and empty conditions effectively.

The SoC has been engineered for use in total knee arthroplasty, facilitating the measurement of pressure balance, and was produced using a UMC18 CMOS process, resulting in a small die size of 3mm by 3mm. It houses a comprehensive suite of components, including an RF transmitter, an ADC, the DW8051 core, interfaces for the ADC and MAC, a MAC controller, bootloader, SPI interface for EEPROM, a multiplexer (MUX), low-dropout regulators (LDOs), and a bandgap reference, offering an advanced level of integration suitable for medical applications involving knee surgery.
