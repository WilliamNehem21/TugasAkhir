Reo is a coordination language for modeling systems, and the paper presents a new approach for symbolic execution of Reo circuits by utilizing Constraint Automata (CA) and focusing on their data constraints. This method allows for the extraction of relationships between data across different nodes and the deduction of coordination patterns. Rather than constructing a traditional symbolic execution tree, the paper suggests an algorithm similar to those used to convert Deterministic Finite Automata into regular expressions, effectively analyzing data-heavy systems and identifying possible deadlocks.

Reo is an exogenous coordination language, constructing complex connectors out of simple channel-based ones and employing CA for compositional semantics. This connection-focused approach is used for modeling communication and synchronization in a range of applications, from system design to web services. The CA enables analysis of circuit behavior and component interactions, and the paper introduces a symbolic execution technique as a more efficient alternative to model checking for specific types of analysis.

The technique assumes deterministic CA with a single initial state, generates a regular expression for a CA, and overcomes the challenges of symbolic execution by abstracting away complex data structures and traversing each cycle a finite number of times. This approach provides an automated tool for Reo circuit analysis that is efficient and reveals deadlocks, livelocks, and coordination patterns without the need for a finite data domain, which is a requirement in model checking.

The paper includes case studies demonstrating the application of the technique and concludes with discussions on the future work to expand the methodology to more applications and derive general expressions for input and output streams of Reo circuits.
