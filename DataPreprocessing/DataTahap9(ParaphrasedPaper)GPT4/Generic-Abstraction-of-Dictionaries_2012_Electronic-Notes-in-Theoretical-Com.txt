The paper introduces a versatile abstract domain framework designed to analyze the contents of dictionaries and arrays. This framework is adaptable and allows for scalar, dictionary key, and dictionary values abstractions. It can integrate different existing abstract domains, not limited to numerical types, but also applicable to analyzing string property variables. The framework is crafted to describe the connection between container contents and individual scalar entities.

This analysis operates automatically, dividing the container based on the traits of the keys through the selected key abstraction. The level of analysis detail and its computational requirements can be tailored according to the abstract domains chosen for the keys, dictionary elements, and scalar variables.

As dictionaries and arrays are fundamental components in programming, static analysis tools should be capable of interpreting the content within these structures. The paper's objective is to offer a universally applicable method for representing dictionaries and arrays in static analysis through abstract interpretation. The proposed solution is fully automated and allows for balance between its precision and cost. Additionally, it supports implementation using different types of abstract domains, not just numerical ones, but also those suitable for analyzing strings.

The paper is structured into several sections, starting with an introduction to the representation of a single dictionary, an explanation of how this is leveraged to create an abstract domain, followed by examples, the discussion of an experimental evaluation, an overview of related work, and finally a conclusion. Detailed proofs and supplementary examples are available in an extended version of the paper.

A critical aspect of their technique is the differentiation between initialized and uninitialized dictionary elements using a lattice structure D(K, V) for content approximation, coupled with an associated element from D(K, Bool) to estimate uninitialized elements. Transfer functions for handling scalar and dictionary operations are provided, demonstrated using interval domains with integral values.

The paper concludes with the development of a content analysis technique for dictionaries and arrays that offers promising results upon experimental evaluation. The effectiveness and resource demands of the technique depend on the specific scalar, dictionary key, and value abstractions chosen.
