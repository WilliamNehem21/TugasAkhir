In this study, the authors present what they believe to be the first quantum algorithm specifically designed for multiobjective combinatorial optimization, based on their knowledge. This algorithm utilizes the adiabatic approach developed by Farhi et al., which allows for the mapping of a multiobjective combinatorial optimization (MCO) problem into a Hamiltonian, using a convex combination of the different objectives. The paper discusses the eigenspectrum characteristics of the pertinent Hamiltonian and establishes through proof that if certain conditional convex combinations of objectives are applied, and if the MCO problem conforms to specified constraints, the quantum adiabatic algorithm can effectively locate Pareto-optimal solutions.

The quantum adiabatic computing paradigm, introduced by Farhi et al., leverages the natural process of quantum annealing. It mirrors classical annealing by associating optimization problems with this quantum phenomenon, naturally guiding the system towards optimal solutions.

The core contribution of this paper lies in demonstrating that Farhi et al.'s quantum adiabatic algorithm can discover Pareto-optimal solutions within a finite time frame, assuming certain problem-specific limitations are respected. Theorem 4.1 delineates the requisite structural conditions an MCO problem must meet to employ the specified adiabatic algorithm effectively.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 offers an overview of multiobjective combinatorial optimization and introduces relevant notations and novel properties. Section 3 covers the quantum adiabatic theorem foundational to the adiabatic algorithm. Section 4 discusses the adiabatic algorithm and how it applies to MCO problems. Section 5 outlines the proof for Theorem 4.1. Section 6 illustrates the application of the algorithm to a specific problem, and Section 7 highlights numerous challenging open-ended questions for further research. Detailed proofs for all presented theorems and lemmas are provided in the supplemental materials.

An MCO problem involves optimizing several objectives within a limited set of feasible solutions, where these objectives often demand trade-offs among different solutions, leading to no singular optimal solution. This study adopts the definition of an MCO problem from Kung, Luccio, and Preparata.

The paper clarifies that only "supported" solutions can be found using Theorem 4.1. Prior research indicates a much larger number of "non-supported" solutions in comparison to "supported" solutions. This discrepancy underscores the importance of developing a quantum algorithm capable of approximating all Pareto-optimal solutions.
