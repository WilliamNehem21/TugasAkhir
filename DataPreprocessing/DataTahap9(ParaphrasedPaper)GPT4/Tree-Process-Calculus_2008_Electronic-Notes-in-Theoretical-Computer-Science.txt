The academic paper highlights that the capability to represent languages using top-down non-deterministic finite tree automata (NFTA) is equivalent to that using bottom-up NFTA. Specifically, the set of languages that can be recognized by top-down NFTAs is identical to the set of languages that can be recognized by bottom-up NFTAs. The paper, however, focuses exclusively on the collection of top-down NFTAs.
