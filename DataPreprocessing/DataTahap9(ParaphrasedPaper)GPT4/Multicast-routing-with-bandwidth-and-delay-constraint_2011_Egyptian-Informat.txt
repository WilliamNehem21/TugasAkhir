This academic paper discusses the advantages of multicast transmissions, particularly for applications like video-clip streaming and IPTV, which can involve sending the same content to millions of users online. Multicast is beneficial as it saves substantial network resources.

In recent years, there has been a growing interest in using Genetic Algorithms (GAs) for complex problems in networking, including network design and routing. Previous works have explored GA both with and without constraints for multicast routing, considering factors such as Quality of Service (QoS) for real-time applications in multicast sessions.

The paper is structured to first describe and formulate the problem, then introduce the genetic algorithm and its operators, and present the proposed algorithm. Two examples illustrate the algorithm's application, examining a smaller eight-node network and a larger 20-node network.

They focus on a multicast tree with a source node and a set of destination nodes. The proposed genetic algorithm approach optimizes link cost, delay, and available bandwidth across the multicast tree. Chromosomes in the GA represent candidate routing solutions, encoded as a series of integers corresponding to the paths between the source and each destination node.

The study introduces a method to find all feasible routes that meet bandwidth constraints, forming a candidate route set for the GA's encoding space. The proposed GA includes crossover and mutation operations with specific parameters to ensure efficient and globally convergent solutions to multimedia multicast routing problems with bandwidth and delay constraints.
