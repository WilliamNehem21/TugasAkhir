Automation in agriculture is becoming increasingly vital due to the growing global population and rising food demand. Traditional farming methods are inadequate to meet this demand, often leading to soil degradation from intensified pesticide use. This paper discusses the potential of automation technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), wireless communications, machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI), and deep learning to address challenges like crop diseases, storage management, weed control, and water management.

Countries are investing heavily in agricultural technology, realizing that advancements are necessary to maintain food security. AI is rapidly spreading across various agricultural domains, refining decision-making and operational processes. McKinion and Lemmon highlighted the importance of AI and expert systems in agriculture, underscoring that solutions must be tailored to specific, complex problems.

The paper surveys research on AI from the 1980s to 2018, covering significant technological advances and interventions such as neural networks for weed differentiation, cotton crop production expert systems (e.g., COMAX), and soybean growth models. Innovative systems like PRITHVI based on fuzzy logic for soybean farming advice in India are explored, demonstrating how knowledge bases can increase productivity.

Evapotranspiration calculation methods and systems like IoT for effective field data communication, expert systems for improved decision-making on soil moisture, and ANN models for predicting water distribution are also investigated. Moreover, precision agriculture and wireless sensor network (WSN) applications are opening new research avenues, promising enhanced agricultural output, smart farming, and resource management.

The paper further examines IoT's pivotal role in smart farming and the deployment strategies for implementing sensor-based systems and wireless communication protocols. Technologies discussed include GPS-enabled robotics, smart irrigation, and warehouse management systems designed to automate and optimize agricultural tasks.

Advancements in image analysis, such as R-CNN for fruit detection, show AI's expanding reach, while web portals and decision support systems illustrate how real-time data can guide farming activities. Other topics discussed are the development of sensor-based irrigation systems and land suitability models that incorporate both scientific and local knowledge.

The paper argues for the necessity of agriculture automation, highlighting areas like irrigation where technology can manage resources more effectively, thus conserving water and reducing waste. Intelligent embedded systems and IoT are shown as key to creating systems that require minimal human intervention.

Ultimately, the paper underscores that automation technologies are not only improving efficiency and productivity but also facilitating plant growth under optimal conditions through detailed monitoring and environment control. These innovations contribute to reducing labor and increasing production, helping meet the rising food demands. The authors collectively contributed to presenting this comprehensive view of agricultural automation.
