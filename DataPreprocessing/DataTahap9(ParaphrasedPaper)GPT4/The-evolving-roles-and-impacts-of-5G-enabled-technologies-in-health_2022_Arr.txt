5G-enabled technologies are proliferating at a rapid pace, impacting various sectors with impressive real-time service capabilities. This study zeroes in on 5G's relevance to healthcare, especially in addressing COVID-19 challenges across various domains. It underscores how 5G is shaping and integrating with technologies like AI, machine learning, IoT, big data analytics, and cloud computing, to combat the epidemic.

Education has been hit hard by the pandemic, with widespread closures affecting approximately 1.2 billion students worldwide as of May 2020. Lockdown measures have forced a shift to online platforms, causing a surge in internet traffic by over 25%.

Healthcare systems are struggling with several issues, such as inadequate services and digital resources, costly treatments, and insufficient data-driven approaches for patient assessment that could lead to over- or underestimation of drug effects. The study explores 5G's role in advancing smart hospitals, remote surgeries, and telemedicine, transforming healthcare delivery.

Though no evidence links 5G with the spread of viruses, such as COVID-19, there is a concern about the potential health effects of radiofrequency radiation. However, 5G promises transformative solutions like enhanced IoT capabilities, supporting a vast number of devices within a given area, leading to advancements like remote health monitoring and telehealth services.

This paper also presents a three-step model for leveraging mHealth. Step one involves collecting data from various sources, followed by step two's usage of this data to support isolation and testing, and step three's use of real-time data to make informed decisions on managing the pandemic.

Additionally, 5G-enabled robots, drones, unmanned vehicles, and disinfection systems play a part in reducing infection risks and facilitating autonomous operations in contaminated zones.

In summary, the integration of 5G with other digital technologies offers prospects for improved healthcare services, despite 5G's non-ionizing radiation presenting no significant health risks below safety levels. 5G's contribution during the pandemic has showcased its potential for wider applications in future health crises. Successful deployment of 5G in healthcare could pave the way for its adoption across other sectors.
