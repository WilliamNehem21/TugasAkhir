This study explores the value of integrating Mixed Reality (MR) technology with serious games as a method for teaching traditional Chinese mortise and tenon joints to college students. Mortise and tenon joinery is a core component of traditional Chinese timber buildings, with educational significance due to its rich historical and cultural information. The complexity of different joint types and structures makes it difficult for students to learn and appreciate these techniques through conventional teaching methods, which can also lead to a lack of student interest.

To address this issue, the study compares the effectiveness of an MR-based serious game approach with traditional teaching methods in terms of knowledge retention, motivation, and situational interest. Serious games are favored in educational settings as they create an engaging learning environment that encourages active participation through problem-solving and instant feedback.

Participants in the study were divided into an experimental group, which used the MR game for learning, and a control group, which received traditional instruction. Both groups covered the same content, with materials developed in consultation with experts. Learning outcomes were measured using tests and scales assessing knowledge retention and motivational factors.

The MR game allowed students to interact with three-dimensional models of mortise and tenon structures, enhancing understanding and recognition of the joints. Results indicated that the MR group scored higher in basic knowledge retention and situational interest, although there was no significant difference in the knowledge transfer part. This suggests that while MR can improve certain aspects of learning, traditional methods may still be effective for learning content that is better represented in two-dimensional formats.

The study underlines the potential benefits of serious games in the context of cultural heritage education, particularly when combined with MR technology, as they can offer a more comprehensive understanding of complex three-dimensional structures. However, the research also highlights limitations, including a narrow focus on specific joints and the need for better information transfer related to two-dimensional content within the MR environment.

The protection of personal information and ethical considerations were maintained throughout the research, with voluntary participation and data confidentiality assured. For further information and data access, the authors can be contacted directly.

In summary, the integration of MR technology into serious games could potentially enhance cultural heritage education by making the learning process more interactive and visually comprehensive, thus encouraging deeper engagement with traditional handicraft techniques like mortise and tenon joinery.
