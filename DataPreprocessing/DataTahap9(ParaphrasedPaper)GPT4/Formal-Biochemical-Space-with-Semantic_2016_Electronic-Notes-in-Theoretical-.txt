Biochemical space (BCS) has been developed as a semi-formal framework for mapping reaction networks of biological processes. It effectively bridges mathematical models to their biological counterparts at suitable levels of abstraction. This paper advances BCS by formalizing its language, employing a simplified kappa calculus to establish rigorous semantics while also offering translation capabilities to BioNetGen Language (BNGL), which is a more established practical, rule-based language. The paper demonstrates the current applications of BCS for modeling cyanobacterial processes.

Rule-based methods were found to effectively convert existing kinetic models of photosynthesis into a more streamlined format by applying a systematic set of reductions based on kappa calculus. This rule-based approach allows for a qualitative framework that aligns with the scientific consensus on the chemical reactions that drive biological processes. Quantitative models can subsequently be adapted to this qualitative rule-based framework.

Unlike KEGG, which lacks the ability to describe rules-based processes in a hierarchical and organism-specific manner, BCS facilitates a more compact representation that simplifies the understanding of complex biological interactions. BCS maintains a qualitative description similar to chemical reactions and is simpler than some process algebraic languages that handle reactions as concurrent processes.

A BCS model is laid out in a text file that provides a readable and editable format, with entities (agents) and rules (abstract chemical reactions) forming its core components. In a case study, a consortium of researchers modeled cyanobacterial processes and established their corresponding BCS model.

BCS effectively utilizes information from linked ontologies for entity and rule definitions, with a focus on attributes such as entity names derived from standard naming conventions or ontologies, and fixed or automatically assigned IDs.

Given the complexity of biological processes, BCS often requires abstraction to remain manageable. Rules are simplified particularly for enzymatic reactions by treating enzymes as modifiers in the reaction rules rather than defining detailed mechanisms.

BCS is built upon a syntax that formalizes the description of agents at different hierarchical levels. These agents range from atomic agents representing both class and object agents to structure agents that depict abstract biochemical objects. This formalized approach supports clear biological object representation while keeping language simplicity.

Translation algorithms are provided to convert BCS models into kappa models and to address the hierarchical construction of complex structures, which is less straightforward in BNGL. This hierarchical approach in BCS, as opposed to the detailed structures in BNGL, supports more efficient rule application and stoichiometry representation.

BCS is part of the CMP suite and is implemented at e-cyanobacterium.org, which includes models for various functional modules of cyanobacteria. It also facilitates the conversion between BCS and BNGL through scripting support.

The complexity of cyanobacteria's circadian clock is elegantly captured in BCS with a reduced number of rules compared to the vast number of entities it would otherwise need to enumerate. Similarly, photosynthesis in the thylakoid membrane is modeled, demonstrating the utility of a rule-based approach in representing processes with a vast number of possible interactions without resorting to a combinatorially explosive enumeration of conformations.
