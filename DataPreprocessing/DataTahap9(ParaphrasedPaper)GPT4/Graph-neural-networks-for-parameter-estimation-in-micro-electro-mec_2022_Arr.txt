This academic paper investigates the potential benefits of using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to predict the outcomes of Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) during their final module level tests, as opposed to traditional machine learning techniques applied to tabular data. The paper seeks to understand whether GNNs, which operate on graph structures, provide enhanced predictive performance and how the graph topology and chosen learning algorithm contribute to overall accuracy.

For this examination, various graph representations of the extensive and varied datasets collected during MEMS device testing were constructed. These graphs were used to train and evaluate four different state-of-the-art GNN models, with the objective of predicting the raw sensitivity in a MEMS gyroscope. The GNNs' performance was compared against conventional machine learning models, such as Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), Neural Network, and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), particularly in scenarios with sparse data.

The results demonstrated that while GNNs matched the performance of the baseline machine learning models using complete datasets, they outperformed those models when data was sparse, achieving lower Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and improving maximum error. The researchers conclude that GNNs have the potential to be particularly beneficial in scenarios where data sparsity is an issue.

The paper is structured as follows: related work in Section 2, a brief introduction to GNNs in Section 3, details of the case study and experiment setup in Section 4, results in Section 5, discussion of these outcomes in Section 6, and finally, the conclusion in Section 7.

Additional insights are provided into the manufacturing applications for graph-based methods, considerations when learning from graph-structured data, the specifics of GNN architecture, and how the researchers simplified the models for evaluation, carefully selecting features and refining the graph structures.
