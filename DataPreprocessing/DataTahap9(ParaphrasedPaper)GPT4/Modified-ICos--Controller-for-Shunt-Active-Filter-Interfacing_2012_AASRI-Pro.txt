The recent focus in power generation has been on incorporating renewable energy sources into the electric grid. Researchers are paying significant attention to creating effective techniques for linking renewable energy systems with the grid. This is important because when renewable sources are connected directly to the grid, they can introduce harmonics that negatively affect power quality. This paper introduces a strategy to use a shunt active filter as an intermediary between renewable energy sources and the grid, incorporating an innovative and improved control method. This advanced control system not only manages the real power flow from the grid but also maintains other functions such as compensating for reactive power, fixing power factor issues, and eliminating harmonics. To test this controller's performance, a non-linear diode bridge rectifier with a resistive load was used, along with introducing an unbalanced load. Simulations under various load conditions confirm that a shunt active filter is efficient as an interface for a renewable energy system attached to the grid.

Literature review shows that various interfacing units like separately connected systems, microgrids, multi-port converters, and custom power devices have been used to connect renewable energy sources with the grid. However, issues like start-up transients, conversion efficiency, and power quality make custom power interfaces such as shunt active filters and STATCOMs preferable. Among these, shunt active filters represent a recent advancement in interfacing technology.

The control strategy involves determining the desired portion of the real power to be supplied by the grid. The difference between the load current and the reference source current is used to establish the reference current for the filter. This reference filter current and the actual filter current are processed through a hysteresis controller, which generates the switching signals for the inverter.
