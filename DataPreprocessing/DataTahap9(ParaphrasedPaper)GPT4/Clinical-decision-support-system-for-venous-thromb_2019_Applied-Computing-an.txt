This paper discusses the development of a clinical decision support system designed to evaluate the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in hospitalized patients. The system relies on an artificial neural network (ANN), specifically a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with a feedforward structure, and utilizes the resilient backpropagation (RPROP) algorithm for training. This model takes 35 input variables, which correlate with VTE risk factors as defined by the Caprini model, and categorizes the risk of VTE into five different levels, from low to high.

The paper describes the iterative process used to determine the optimal number of hidden nodes and layers in the network, and highlights that the model was trained on a dataset comprising 150 medical records from the Jordan University Hospital (JUH). The effectiveness of the system was assessed using a stratified ten-fold cross-validation approach, and the results indicated that the system could predict VTE risk with an accuracy of 81%.

The paper further explains the broader context of VTE as a significant health concern associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. It elaborates on the training process of the MLP involving error calculation and weight adjustment to reduce the discrepancy between predicted and desired outputs. It also discusses the role of cross-validation in evaluating a model's performance and ensuring its generalizability to new data.

The authors compare their ANN-based model's performance with other prediction models in different medical applications, underscoring the enhanced accuracy provided by ANNs. They incorporate a confusion matrix in their results to offer detailed insight into the model's performance across the different risk categories.

Finally, the paper introduces Abdullah A. Awidi, a notable figure in medicine, hematology, and oncology, who played a key role in the development of the system and is affiliated with Jordan University and the Cell Therapy Center.

In conclusion, the study presents the architecture and performance evaluation of a clinical decision support system employing an ANN, demonstrating its potential utility in assessing the risk levels of VTE in hospitalized patients with good accuracy, and it suggests opportunities for future research and improvement in this area.
