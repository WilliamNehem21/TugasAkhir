In recent times, the Internet of Things (IoT) has become an integral component of everyday activities, employing constant internet connectivity to interlink various computing devices, thus enabling the completion of tasks. The foundation of the IoT lies in sensors that record, gather, and disseminate information over wireless sensor networks (WSNs). These sensors act as data generators, whereas IoT applications are considered data recipients in this study. The IoT is distinguished by its significant data throughput, categorizing it as a data-rich territory.

The aim of this research is to enhance the availability of data and system operation across all IoT applications by minimizing both energy usage and latency. An intelligent methodology is proposed for effective network traffic management, which can also reduce packet collisions during data transmission. This study introduces a novel intelligent method called iFogRep for dynamic, consistent replication and positioning of IoT data using fog computing.

There are three main contributions from iFogRep:

1. The first is an innovative dynamic positioning algorithm that matches each sensor to the best suited 'owner' node. It utilizes a machine learning technique and an optimization function to calculate the true latency between the source and its destination, while determining the optimal capacity for each owner. The optimal owner is chosen by evaluating which one has the least latency and energy use, ultimately lessening the overall latency of the system.

2. The second contribution is an intelligent replication protocol designed to limit the amount of data transmitted and decrease the access latency for applications. Employing an adaptive prediction method, this protocol forecasts the optimal number of data replicas and dynamically assigns their locations, utilizing a proficient machine learning model to identify the path with the lowest latency.

The paper is structured as follows: it begins by reviewing prior research related to IoT performance issues such as latency, availability, and inconstancy in Section 2. Section 3 introduces the proposed methods and algorithms aimed at improving the placement, replication, and consistency within the IoT. The evaluation of the proposed approach through experimental studies is presented in Section 4, and the paper concludes in Section 5.

The authors discussed a dynamic data placement and replication strategy, employing graph partitioning (GP) for effective data storage on edge servers to reduce latency and using a support vector machine for classifying data centers and forecasting workloads.

To achieve high data accessibility, replication is necessary, but it also necessitates maintaining consistency among the data replicas. Data consistency involves the ability to contemporaneously synchronize all copies of data. Synchronization of replicas, however, introduces additional latency, influenced by the number of copies and their geographic distribution.

This study includes the consumer list, which is updated by adding or removing nodes in response to access pattern changes. A subcomponent known as the path miner takes charge of leveraging the networkâ€™s physical attributes to ascertain and calculate the most optimized shortest path among all fog nodes, employing an algorithm previously introduced.

Ultimately, each sensor is uniquely associated with an optimal fog node, with each fog node responsible for a specific subset of data, acting as the 'owner' for those data items. Thus, each data piece is assigned singularly to one fog node designated as its owner.
