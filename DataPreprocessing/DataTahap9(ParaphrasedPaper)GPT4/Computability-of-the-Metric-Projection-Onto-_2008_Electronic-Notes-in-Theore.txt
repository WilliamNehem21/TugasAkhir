In the investigated work, we consider the closed and compact subsets within the context of normed and metric spaces. Specifically, the paper identifies the collection of all closed subsets in a metric space X as A(X), while the collection of all compact subsets is denoted K(X). The methodologies used to depict these spaces are based on definitions and analyses previously developed by Brattka and Presser.

The study confirms that the norm of a normed space X is considered to exhibit strict convexity if, for the space, every non-empty closed convex subset is uniquely determined. Furthermore, if every non-empty closed convex subset in a normed space X can be associated with at least one point within the set, the space is deemed reflexive. The paper also establishes that a normed space X is both reflexive and possesses a strictly convex norm if and solely if every non-empty closed convex subset is a Chebyshev set. This implies that in a uniformly convex Banach space X, each non-empty closed convex subset qualifies as a Chebyshev set, which in turn means that the metric projection onto these sets is unique and well-defined for all points in the space.
