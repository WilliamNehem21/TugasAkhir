Wearable technology equipped with integrated sensors like accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers allows for real-time observation of daily activities. Although their use in activity monitoring is growing, there is a need for systems that can accurately identify activities with minimal context. These systems analyze multi-dimensional activity data to recognize motion patterns and behaviors, such as walking or cooking. Such monitoring is crucial in applications like smart homes and elderly care, but current systems can struggle with accuracy.

Advancements in wearable sensors have revolutionized many aspects of daily life, from healthcare to comfort, by providing environment-awareness and supporting applications in healthcare, security, and well-being. Continuous monitoring is key to these applications, allowing for the safety of the elderly and children, and creating opportunities for responsive security systems and fitness tracking.

Inertial sensors like accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers enable the detection of body movements within three-dimensional space. Accelerometers measure both static and dynamic acceleration, gyroscopes assess angular velocity, and magnetometers gauge magnetic field intensity changes. When fused into a single unit, these sensors enhance human activity monitoring capabilities.

The paper discusses a proposed Human Daily Activity Recognition (HDAR) model, detailing its architecture and evaluating it against benchmark datasets to assess performance metrics. To handle dataset imbalances, a weighted Support Vector Machine (SVM) is employed, which leads to improved recognition rates for static activities but lesser accuracy for dynamic movements like stair climbing.

The study also examines the sensitivity of Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) to signal disruptions and the need for noise filtering. The authors propose using a third-order median filter for denoising signals without losing significant information.

The utilization of the Haar Wavelet Transform (HWT) is presented as an efficient signal processing tool. The HDAR approach uses Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) to optimize feature descriptors, which are then analyzed with a Random Forest (RF) algorithm. The authors highlight the effectiveness of minibatch SGD to reduce variability and the importance of carefully selecting adaptive learning rates.

Furthermore, the Random Forest classifier is used due to its accuracy and rapid training abilities. It operates by constructing numerous decision trees and aggregating the classification outcomes. Studies were conducted employing sensors on the hip to collect activity data and from three IMU sensors placed strategically across the body to record daily activities.

The HDAR framework is being designed to achieve high recognition accuracy across benchmark datasets by optimizing feature selection and employing classifiers for activity recognition. Initial denoising is followed by feature extraction, optimization, and classification with a Random Forest, revealing significant performance advancements relative to existing methods.
