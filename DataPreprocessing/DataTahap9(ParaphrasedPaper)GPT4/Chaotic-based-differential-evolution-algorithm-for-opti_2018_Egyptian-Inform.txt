The Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm, recognized as an effective heuristic technique for solving global optimization problems, was originally introduced by Storn and Price. Appreciated for its simplicity and robust convergence properties, it has become progressively popular across various fields due to its straightforward implementation and excellent performance in solving optimization issues.

Traditional random procedures in DE have a tendency to lead to homogeneity among the population members, which is suboptimal as it reduces diversity. To address this, new methods incorporating chaotic functions have been proposed. These functions, useful in diverse areas such as meteorology, computer science cryptography, chemical engineering gas solubility, economic financial modeling, and biology hydrology, are based on the sensitivity of dynamic systems to initial conditions. Thus, they exhibit unpredictable yet deterministic behavior, making a small change in the system capable of producing large variations in outcomes.

Price and Stornâ€™s DE algorithm differs from simple genetic algorithms by using floating-point representation for its genetic material instead of the binary coding. It operates by generating trial parameter vectors through the addition of weighted differences between two population members to a third one. Mutation and crossover mechanisms create new potential solutions, and a selection process determines which vectors continue to subsequent generations.

The algorithm is governed by three main parameters: the scaling factor (SF), crossover constant (CR), and population size (PS). An initial population of PS individuals is established, each representing potential solutions within the feasible space of the optimization problem. The DE algorithm maintains the size of this population constant throughout the optimization process.

The paper extends the application of DE to the control of a fluidized bed within a drying process, which relies on a centrifugal fan to circulate air and features two crucial output variables: the moisture content and the product temperature. The drying process typically unfolds in three stages: the loading phase with the material to be dried, the heating phase to achieve constant drying, and the falling rate phase where the drying rate decreases until the desired final dryness level is reached, at which point the material is discharged.
