The paper presents an advancement in the field of multialgebra, which extends traditional outcomes of algebraic theories. It highlights that a key product of this research is the way derived operators within a multialgebraic context can be effectively represented through term graphs. The intrinsic nature of sharing in this framework provides a straightforward means of symbolizing both nondeterminism and domain restrictions, which proves valuable for specificational purposes.

The document outlines certain practices that make it easier to comprehend two fundamental operations related to term graphs. When two term graphs are composed, the process involves aligning the roots of the first graph with the variables of the second, followed by a removal of these variables. An example with term graph G3 demonstrates the composition of term graphs G1 and G2. The union operation is basically the combination of two term graphs without overlap, with a resultant term graph (G4, for instance) that merges the variables and roots from G1 and G2.

Finally, the paper presents a lemma that consolidates various important findings related to certain mathematical structures (pushouts and pushout complements). These are necessary for the application of the Double Pushout (DPO) approach within directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), using the rule format previously explained. The article specifically focuses on plain morphisms as the only type of matches, which is justified by the given lemma 7.3.
