In the current millennium, the United States has seen vehicle registrations surge by 19%, or around 46 million vehicles, in the first two decades. This sharp increase has exacerbated the problems of traffic accidents, road congestion, and environmental pollution. Solutions such as Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and smart traffic lights are proposed to alleviate these issues by reducing traffic light wait times and improving the driving experience. In dense urban areas, optimized traffic scheduling and smarter junction traffic flows through technologies like ITS, which may use approaches like genetic algorithms, fuzzy logic, neural networks, PLC, machine learning and deep learning, and Virtual Traffic Lights (VTL), can reduce congestion, shorten travel times, and lower CO2 emissions.

However, these methods may fall short in extremely congested areas or intersections without waiting vehicles. To address real-time vehicle demands at intersections, detectors are installed to monitor the demand automatically and adjust traffic signals accordingly to minimize wait times and optimize green phases.

Xu et al. utilized Generative Adversarial Networks for predicting road traffic conditions, essential for ITS to assist travelers and governments in traffic management. A model by Saini et al. used a Convolutional Neural Network for reliable traffic light state detection under various conditions. Hagenauer et al. explored self-organized traffic management algorithms using VTL in vehicle-to-vehicle networks, observing improved resource efficiency under moderate network load.

Arel et al. demonstrated the use of reinforcement learning neural networks (RL) in managing traffic light cycles effectively across multiple intersections, with agents at each intersection learning to control signals for optimized traffic flow. Iyer et al. discussed using multi-agent fuzzy logic and Q-learning to coordinate traffic agents, while Teo et al. employed genetic algorithms to optimize traffic light timing. Wang et al.’s adaptive LQR in a microscopic simulation showed reduced traffic delay compared to standard signals.

Siyal and Fathy improved intersection traffic flow with edge detection and neural networks. John et al. leveraged machine learning with computer vision for traffic signal recognition in varied lighting, enhanced by GPS data. Zou et al.’s fuzzy logic system based on a wireless sensor network showed potential through decreased waiting times. Biswas et al.'s literature review underscored valuable contributions to intelligent traffic systems, while Nesmachnow et al. developed a parallel algorithm for traffic light synchronization tailored for buses and general vehicles, leading to improved average speeds.

Burguillo et al. simulated traffic on a grid network with NetLogo, noting reduced waiting times with a greater proportion of self-organizing intersections. Patrascu et al. found a reduction in vehicle waiting times and fuel consumption, and an increase in speed using the JADE framework, Java, and SUMO simulation.

Finally, traffic volume assessment is enhanced by an infrared detection system that triggers timers when vehicles interrupt an infrared beam, helping to better understand traffic flow and congestion based on vehicle size and speed.
