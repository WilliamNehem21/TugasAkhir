This excerpt from a research paper discusses recent advancements in the application of sonic logs to evaluate gas-hydrate systems, specifically the generation of synthetic shear sonic logs using machine learning models. The conventional monopole logging tool's limitation in slow formations is mentioned, highlighting the necessity for alternative methods.

Machine learning models that integrate a multi-hidden layer extreme learning model (MELM) with optimization algorithms such as particle swarm optimization (PSO) and genetic algorithms have been successful in improving the prediction of shear sonic logs. However, there’s a noted focus on comparing machine learning models rather than optimizing the best model's performance due to limitations like applying a single set of hyperparameters.

The study introduces a hybrid machine learning model that aims to generate more accurate shear sonic logs. They propose unsupervised data clustering and the PSO algorithm to enhance model performance by helping to determine optimal hyperparameters for three machine learning models: support vector regression (SVR), deep neural networks (DNN), and long short-term memory networks (LSTM). These methods are expected to reduce manual effort and processing time.

For comparative purposes, multi-linear regression (MLR) was used to test prediction accuracy with various input features, guided by the Pearson correlation coefficient. The case with five features was found to be the most accurate.

The paper also describes how weights are assigned within an LSTM and introduces the PSO algorithm and its role in the optimization of machine learning models. It mentions the use of callback and early stopping techniques to reduce unnecessary computational time.

Finally, it summarizes the main findings: the ML models achieved satisfactory results in predicting downhole sonic logging tool (DTS) values, with DNN-PSO and LSTM-PSO models outperforming SVR-PSO models. Between DNN-PSO and LSTM-PSO, the latter showed better performance regarding R² and mean absolute error (MAE), although it had more outliers that increased the mean square error (MSE) and root mean square error (RMSE) compared to DNN-PSO models.
