The approach outlined is versatile, fitting with various process calculi, and clarifies distinct components inherent in the construction of these calculi. Specifically, it differentiates between the characteristics of the behavior model, such as contrasts between active and reactive or deterministic and nondeterministic elements, and the interaction framework that delineates the synchronization rules.

The concept of the sort of a process 'p', symbolized as l(p), captures the set of actions that a process can potentially engage in, as reflected in the process's derivation paths. The paper proposes a method to infer an overapproximation of l(p) by recursively analyzing the structure of the process expression. Alternatively, this sort could be characterized through a semantic perspective.
