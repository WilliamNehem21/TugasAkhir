The two components of Lemma 5.6 have analogous demonstrations, both of which involve applying the graph functor to transform commutative diagrams in category B into morphisms within the category Rel(E). By employing the graph lemma, it is shown that these morphisms are in fact Fr-algebras. Combining Lemma 5.5 and Lemma 5.6 directly leads to the core discovery of the research.
