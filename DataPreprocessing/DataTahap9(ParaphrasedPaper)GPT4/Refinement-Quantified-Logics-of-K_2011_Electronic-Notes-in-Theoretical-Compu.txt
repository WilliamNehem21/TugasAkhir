Balbiani et al. investigated a more complex version of public announcement logic, called arbitrary public announcement logic, which includes a feature for expressing quantification over any possible public announcements. Following this, Van Ditmarsch and French demonstrated the undecidability of this logical system when applied to multiple agents, suggesting that comparable logical systems involving action models might also lack decidability.
