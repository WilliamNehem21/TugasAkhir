This academic paper discusses the significance of context-free languages in computer language processing and formal language theory. It uses the pumping lemma for context-free languages to demonstrate that certain languages are not context-free, and provides a formalized proof that context-free languages are not closed under intersection. The authors have mechanized all their formalizations in the Coq proof assistant.

The main contributions of this work include the application of the pumping lemma for context-free languages, with this being the first known computer-verified proof for the non-context-freeness of certain languages. Prior to this work, such proofs have only been available in written (pen and paper) form. The formalized approach serves both educational purposes and enhances the understanding of formal proofs, marking a pioneering effort in employing interactive theorem proving in the realm of context-free languages.

The paper outlines the method used to formalize languages and demonstrates the formalization of three well-known non-context-free languages, comparing the complexity between text-based proofs and their formalized counterparts. The authors observe that while text proofs are concise, the formal proofs are lengthier, highlighting the attention to detail required in formal proof-writing.

One example given is the formalization of the language comprising words where the length is a square number; while the text proof is short, the formal proof script is much longer. Similarly, formalizing the language made of words of prime length showcases the same disparity in proof lengths.

The formalization of the highly combinatorial language where the numbers of ‘a,’ ‘b,’ and ‘c’ characters must be equal (anbncn) proved significantly more complex. It involved addressing combinatorial issues and handling many special cases, resulting in a formal proof much longer than the text proof.

The paper presents an argument that the complexity of formal proofs could be eased with specialized Coq libraries, and suggests that their work could stimulate the development of such tools. It also contextualizes the length and complexity of formal proofs by noting that simplified text proofs tend to omit details that must be explicated in a formal proof.

Furthermore, by showing that the intersection of two context-free languages can produce a non-context-free language, they formally prove that the class of context-free languages is not closed under intersection. The proof of this in text form is brief, but the formal proof requires substantial detail.

In conclusion, the paper reflects on the importance of their results as a foundation for further research and as a teaching resource. The work provides both a better understanding of the properties of context-free languages and an improvement in formal reasoning skills through interactive proof assistance.
