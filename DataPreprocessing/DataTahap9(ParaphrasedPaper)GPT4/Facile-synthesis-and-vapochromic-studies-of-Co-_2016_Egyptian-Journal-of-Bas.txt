Isonicotinic acid (0.246 g, 2 mmol) and cobalt(II) acetate tetrahydrate (0.332 g, 1 mmol) were carefully measured and then thoroughly mixed by grinding in an agate mortar for a duration of 15 minutes, resulting in a light pink substance. This substance was then purified with methanol to eliminate any unreacted materials and subsequently air-dried at ambient temperature, yielding a 37.21% recovery. Analysis of the X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) patterns revealed additional peaks in Compound 1 that were not present in the malonic acid, suggesting the creation of a novel compound, indicating the potential interaction between malonic acid and cobalt acetate. In a similar manner, the XRPD patterns for Compound 2 showed distinct differences from those of the isonicotinic acid, which indicates that the crystalline structures of the starting material and the resulting compound were different.
