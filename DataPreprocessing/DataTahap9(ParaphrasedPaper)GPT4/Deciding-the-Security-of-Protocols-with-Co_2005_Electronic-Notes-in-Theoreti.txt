This paper discusses the challenges and advancements in analyzing the security of cryptographic protocols that use commutative encryption functions, such as RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman). Traditional analysis models struggle to address such functions because they usually consider messages in a formal system that doesn't account for the order of operations—something commutative encryption relies on.

Recently, the perfect encryption hypothesis for analyzing protocols has been somewhat loosened, with efforts made to develop unification algorithms that cater to specific cryptographic properties, such as those in Diffie-Hellman systems. While these developments aid in understanding specific scenarios, they fall short of a broader solution to determine protocol security when commutative encryption is involved.

The paper cites earlier works that have proved security for protocols using operations like exclusive-or and Diffie-Hellman exponentiations. However, despite this progress, the cited works either lack a formal decision-making procedure for security or place heavy restrictions on the protocol and adversary model.

Two sample cryptographic protocols demonstrate the practicality of commutative properties in public key encryption: Shamir's secure communication protocol and a contract-signing protocol. These protocols show that because of commutativity, the sequence of operations (like signing a message with a private key) does not need to be known beforehand by the participants.

The paper introduces an NP decision procedure for identifying insecurity in protocols that use RSA. This procedure extends the capabilities of the 'Dolev-Yao' intruder model to include the ability to perform RSA encryption and decryption—hence the label 'RSA intruder.' The RSA intruder model includes several standard conditions, as well as the novel feature of allowing the adversary to engage in commutative public key encryption.

The authors' model considers multiple sessions of a protocol as a singular protocol instance. They focus on systems wherein messages are normalized—structured in a way that makes analysis feasible—upon which the intruder's knowledge and actions can be clearly defined and limited. This approach also considers attacks that could be launched even with incomplete or partial protocol sessions.

To summarize, the paper presents a method for evaluating the security of cryptographic protocols that use commutative encryption, particularly RSA encryption, which had not been adequately addressed by previous automatic analysis models.
