The paper addresses the adaptation of certain system properties, such as information flow and causation, to work with abstract systems composed of nondeterministic components. The authors introduce a method to "weaken" these properties by disregarding pairs of behaviors that are inconsistent and would breach the original strict properties. Automated tests designed for the original properties are adjusted to test for these weakened variants, enabling their application to more complex system architectures.

Specifically, the paper focuses on "non-causation," a property that denotes the lack of causal relationships between two disjoint sets of events, A and B. The idea is that events in B, and any other events not in A that precede events in B, should be unaffected by the occurrence of events in A. The paper establishes circumstances under which a property called "refinement-closed non-deterministic causation" (RCFNDC) is satisfied by systems comprising two components with non-overlapping event sets, H and L.

The researchers argue that systems constructed through interleaving its components should ideally exhibit no causal relationships or information flow between these components. They point out that nondeterministic components can complicate matters as they may introduce refinements that contravene the RCFNDC property. To address this, the authors weaken the RCFNDC so it can be properly applied to composite systems by discarding insecure refinements.

Additionally, the paper touches upon Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP), a mathematical theory used to model systems in which multiple processes communicate by synchronizing on common events. The paper explains different types of choices within CSP: "external choice" where processes offer initial events and the system resolves the choice after an event occurs, "internal choice" where the system nondeterministically behaves like one of its choices, and a derivative that behaves like one choice but only offers the initial events of another.

Through the discussions and modifications presented, the authors aim to refine the applicability of tests for system properties in a way that aligns with the actual behavior of systems with nondeterministic components, and to ensure that these properties can be integrated into the analysis of complex, abstract system architectures.
