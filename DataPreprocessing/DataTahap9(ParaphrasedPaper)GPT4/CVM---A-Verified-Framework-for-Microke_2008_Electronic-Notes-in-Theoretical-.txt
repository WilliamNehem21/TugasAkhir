The paper discusses the daunting prospect of simplifying the complexities of operating system implementations, which are often massive; as an example, it cites the Linux 2.6.0 kernel, which has around 6 million lines of code. Despite this, the concept of a compact and dependable kernel is not unprecedented, which led to the creation of second-generation microkernels like L4. These microkernels provide basic yet adequate functionality and can be significantly smaller in size. Using a microkernel as a trusted platform allows for the running of two operating systems: one streamlined and reliable for critical tasks, and another standard one for general purposes.

In the context of the Cooperative Virtual Machine (CVM), devices are utilized in two main ways: firstly, as a hard disk acting as the swap device managed by the page fault handler, and secondly, by making various typical devices accessible to user processes via kernel calls. At present, five different types of devices are supported, including hard disks for swap and timers for process scheduling.

For memory virtualization, the Virtual Address Memory Protection (VAMP) operates in two modes: user mode for virtual address handling and system mode for direct physical address operations, with the microkernel running in system mode and user processes in user mode. The transition between these modes hinges on a special register, with system mode allowing direct instructions and user mode requiring address translations that could either trigger page faults or lead to translated physical addresses.

In terms of functionality, the abstract kernel provides declarations for CVM primitives but necessitates the addition of undisplayed functions and global variables for the concrete instance. Address mapping includes not only the architectural physical memory address (PMA) but also a software-defined swap memory address (SMA) managed by the page fault handler.

The concrete kernel must not only emulate the abstract kernel but also translate from the C0 programming language to execute on actual hardware, relying on the accuracy of the compiler. This kernel is written in C0 with embedded assembly, and correctness in translation is crucial, using tools such as the Verisoft project's simple C0 compiler or translation validation methods.

Future work is set to focus on verifying more CVM primitives, particularly those interacting with devices and managing block mode access, which poses challenges like interrupt handling during such access. Moreover, the new Verisoft XT hypervisor project addresses the complexity of running a multi-threaded virtualization layer on a multi-processor system with a weak memory model, using an advanced optimizing compiler. The differences between CVM and the hypervisor project suggest that direct reuse of CVM components is unlikely, although the experiences and lessons learned will be invaluable.
