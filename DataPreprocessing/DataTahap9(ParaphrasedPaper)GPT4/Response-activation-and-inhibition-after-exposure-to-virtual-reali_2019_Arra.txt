The recent availability of affordable virtual reality (VR) technology and applications has led to an increase in public usage, raising concerns about potential risks and aftereffects. Although manufacturers offer general usage guidance, there is a lack of up-to-date empirical evidence on the safety and effects of modern VR systems. The main objective of this study was to investigate the effects of short-term exposure to VR on response activation and inhibition using a cued go/no-go task. The study found evidence of participant fatigue during the reaction time tests but confirmed that short VR sessions with modern head-mounted displays (HMDs) are safe, while also highlighting the need for additional research on reaction time effects.

Most research into cybersickness measures effects with questionnaires or by assessing postural instability and physiological responses. However, this study took a more practical approach, examining real-world VR HMD use with commercially available hardware and software, focusing on 15-minute exposures and their potential impact on cognitive performance.

Participants first practiced the cued go/no-go reaction time task before and after interacting with a VR environment using an Oculus Rift CV1 HMD. The sessions lasted around 90 minutes, with each participant completing a set of tasks and questionnaires.

The study found no significant difference in response activation or inhibition after the short VR experience, aligning with VR manufacturers' safety advice for brief usage. While three participants withdrew due to discomfort, suggesting a link to cybersickness, these cases fell outside the study's focus. Moreover, the longer reaction time task in the study suggested that participant fatigue could have influenced test performance.

While the study did report an improvement in reaction times, it was not statistically significant. Differences from previous studies included a longer and possibly more tiring reaction task, suggesting that the construction of reaction time tests could be important in assessing VR effects.

The study calls for future research to consider cognitive fatigue and other contributing factors when using reaction time measures to evaluate the impacts of VR, pointing out the increasing need for a robust evidence base to support VR usage guidelines given the rise of VR technologyâ€™s popularity among the general public.
