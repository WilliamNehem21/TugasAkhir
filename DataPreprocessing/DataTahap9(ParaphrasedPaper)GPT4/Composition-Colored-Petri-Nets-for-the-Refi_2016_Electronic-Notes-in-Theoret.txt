This academic paper discusses the use of a new type of Petri nets, called Composition Petri Nets (Comp-Nets) and their colored extension, Colored Composition Petri Nets (ComCP-Nets), for efficiently implementing structural refinement in reaction-based models without increasing the model size in terms of places and transitions. These Petri nets are designed to capture both the dynamic behaviors of models and the compositional relationships between their elements.

The paper is structured as follows:

1. The concept of structural model refinement is detailed.
2. The notion of Petri nets with a compositional part (Comp-Nets) is introduced.
3. Comp-Nets are extended to ComCP-Nets with color coding.
4. The implementation of reaction-based models using ComCP-Nets is discussed.
5. An algorithm for applying model refinement using ComCP-Nets is presented.
6. Conclusions are drawn.

Comp-Nets include both an active part, functioning as a standard Petri net, and a passive part that describes the compositional structure of elements. For complex system networks, ComCP-Nets help manage complexity by using colors to represent different species variations.

Colors in ComCP-Nets are chosen to reflect the composition of places automatically, with simple color sets for atomic places and multisets for complex places. The paper provides examples and discusses how properties of Colored Petri nets are generalized to ComCP-Nets.

The paper also notes that representing a model as a ComCP-Nets depends on the choice of color sets and bijections. The presented modeling approach is compared with others, such as the kappa language, highlighting the benefits of ComCP-Nets in adding structural information graphically and formally to Petri nets.
