In the paper, the authors develop a systematic approach for enhancing the way systems are formally refined to incorporate considerations of power consumption. This approach extends the traditional refinement calculus of action systems and integrates it with the time-wise refinement method, providing a robust mathematical foundation for systems designed using the timed action systems formalism. When refining an abstract system to a more concrete version, the designer must ensure that the system meets not only functional and temporal requirements but also power-related constraints.

The paper further explains the refinement of actions and procedures within the system, with a focus on how variables are read or written during actions, and how actions can be composed within the systems. The authors make distinctions between write variables (variables assigned within the action) and read variables (other variables used in the action) and explain how action systems can be closed or open based on the presence of interface variables and procedures.

The authors introduce a performance modeling framework for evaluating the size of an action system in terms of area complexity. This framework helps to compare the energy consumption of different actions within hardware systems. They use a library called "Buddy" to analyze addition and multiplication operations at various bit widths to validate their model, achieving an accuracy rate of about 83%.

The paper also discusses the modeling and analysis of dynamic and static power consumption within these systems. Dynamic power is associated with the operation of the system, while static power consumption stems from leakage current, which becomes increasingly significant as chip technology scales down. The authors mention that techniques are emerging to control gate leakage, but static power consumption cannot be ignored in modern technology.

Finally, the paper delves into power analysis and timing constraints for action systems, describing how to model static power consumption and detailing the process of evaluating average power consumption over a system's operational cycle. The paper emphasizes the importance of adhering to relative timing constraints to ensure that operations are executed in the correct order within the specified time domain. The refinement process also includes enhancing system models by adding new functionality without compromising existing behaviors.

The paper references additional studies and chapters for further reading, such as a chapter on noise reduction techniques in network-on-chip (NoC) interconnects.
