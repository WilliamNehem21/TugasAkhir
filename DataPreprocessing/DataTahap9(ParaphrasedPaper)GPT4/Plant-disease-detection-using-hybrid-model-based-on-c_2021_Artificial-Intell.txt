India is primarily an agricultural nation where agriculture plays a critical role in its economy, contributing to 16% of the country's GDP and accounting for 10% of its total exports (Himani, 2014). A significant portion of India's population, around 75%, is associated with the agricultural sector, either directly or indirectly (Himani, 2014). As a result, producing crops that are free from disease is vital for economic growth.

This study introduces an innovative hybrid deep learning model for the automatic detection of plant diseases, which employs a mixed approach of Convolutional Autoencoders (CAEs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model presents an advance in the field, incorporating the two techniques in a way not previously explored in the literature. It enables the reduction of complexity through dimensionality reduction by the CAE, resulting in fewer parameters needing to be trained. The utility of the model is demonstrated through its application in identifying bacterial spot disease in peach plants, which is caused by the Xanthomonas campestris bacterium. Importantly, the model holds potential for recognizing other plant diseases as well.

The paper is structured into five sections, with Section 2 reviewing the current methods for automatic plant disease detection, Section 3 detailing the materials and methodologies for crafting the hybrid model, Section 4 presenting the experimental results in detecting bacterial spot disease in peach plants, and Section 5 providing conclusions.

Padding in neural networks expands the input matrix with zero-value layers around the border, thereby maintaining the input matrix's size post-convolution and ensuring edge and corner data are accounted for in processing. There are two padding types: valid and same. A pooling operation reduces the output of a network layer by computing an aggregated value, such as a maximum or average, from its neighbors.

Autoencoders, including CAEs, encode image data into a compressed form and reconstruct it via decoding layers. The CAE used in this research focuses on conserving essential features in leaf images while compressing them to facilitate easier disease classification by a CNN. Reconstruction loss, representing the difference between the original and reconstructed image data, is minimized during CAE training using the backpropagation algorithm. 

The research utilizes Jupyter Notebook, a Python IDE, for experimental procedures, although other languages like MATLAB or R could also be employed. The training and testing datasets were split using Python's sklearn API, and the model was built and trained with the Keras API. 

The developed model serves two primary functions: it enables automatic plant disease detection on systems with limited computational resources and can be used in mobile applications, offering quick disease identification without the need to transmit images to a server and ensuring data privacy for the users.
