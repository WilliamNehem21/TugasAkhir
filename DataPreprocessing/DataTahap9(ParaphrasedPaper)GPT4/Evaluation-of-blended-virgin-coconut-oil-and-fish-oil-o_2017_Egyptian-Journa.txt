This academic paper discusses the impact of virgin coconut oil (VCO) as a dietary inclusion in the feed of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) when faced with Streptococcus iniae infection. The research found that while fish exhibited higher levels of VCO when infected, their plasma metabolite indicators remained unchanged across different treatments. Adding VCO at 3% to the fish diet led to excellent growth performance, suggesting that VCO could effectively replace fish oil (FO), offering a superior alternative lipid source for O. niloticus nutrition.

Fish oil and fish meal are key protein sources in aquaculture feeds, significantly affecting production costs. A rise in demand for these components is likely to increase feed production costs and could challenge the growth and stability of the aquaculture industry. Moreover, the high demand for fish oil threatens certain low-value fish species, like herring and sardines, due to overfishing for oil production.

In the study, fish were grouped in triplicates and fed one of five experimental diets twice daily, with intake monitored by weight before and after feeding. Fish weight, feed utilization, and survival were recorded bi-weekly, while tanks were cleaned regularly.

The researchers observed significant differences in the fatty acid (FA) profile of the fish, particularly in the omega-3 (n-3) series, following the inclusion of VCO in the diet. While all treatments affected the n-3 series, with a decrease from 12.37% (FO) to 4.42% (3VCO), significant differences were also noted among these treatments. It was suggested that tilapia can bio-convert certain saturated and unsaturated FAs to maintain long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs). The fish fed a VCO-enriched diet also demonstrated this ability, though those consuming FO maintained the highest levels of LC-PUFAs in their muscle and body lipid.

However, the study proposed that fish might not efficiently incorporate LC-PUFAs in muscle lipid due to competition from other fatty acids, potentially impacting the overall nutritional quality of tissue. Nonetheless, good retention of LC-PUFAs and increased amounts of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and medium-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (MC-PUFAs) were observed, in line with fish fed diets rich in saturated fat (SFA) and MC-PUFA.

The paper also addresses how dietary essential fatty acids may affect immune response and disease resistance. While excessive levels of n-3 FAs may decrease antibody titers and increase fish mortality, the research indicated that diets incorporating 3% VCO resulted in the lowest mortality rate against S. iniae infection, without compromising growth performance.

Lastly, it emphasized VCO's composition and its associated antibacterial, antiprotozoal, and antiviral properties. Specifically, components such as monoglycerides and fatty acids between C6 to C14, as well as lauric acid, have been shown to inactivate viruses and destroy pathogenic gram-negative bacteria, thereby confirming VCO's potential to enhance the immune system of O. niloticus.
