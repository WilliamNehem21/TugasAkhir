Games have long been utilized in various disciplines such as mathematics, economics, logic, and computer science. In the latter field, two-player games are especially prominent for modeling interactions between an agent, like a program, and its surrounding environment, which could be the user or an operating system, among others. This subject is often explored within the field of game semantics.

In a particular aspect of concurrent games, a straightforward operation known as 'simple parallel composition' is used. If you have two event structures, identified as A and B, each with its own defined polarities, this operation places them side by side while ensuring that they remain distinct. It preserves their causal relationships and determines a set of events as consistent when this set conforms to the consistency found within subsets of A and B separately. The original polarities of the events are kept intact during this process.

The paper then advances to establish the 'value theorem' concerning concurrent games. This validation takes place in two primary phases. The first phase involves presenting essential constructions pertaining to strategies, followed by examining the outcomes when these strategies interact. This examination is fundamental to identifying the values associated with all possible positions in the game. The second phase uses the inherent well-founded nature of the game to present the anticipated value theorem.
