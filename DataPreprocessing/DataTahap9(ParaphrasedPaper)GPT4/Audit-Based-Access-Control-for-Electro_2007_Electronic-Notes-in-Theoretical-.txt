This paper discusses the management and protection of sensitive data within complex and distributed computer systems via access control mechanisms. Rather than purely preventive systems which seek to stop unauthorized actions before they happen, the authors explore an a-posteriori access control framework known as audit logic. This method minimizes upfront access control to basic user authentication and authorization, while implementing more complicated security tasks during a subsequent auditing process. The paper presents a case study centered on medical staff and health records to illustrate how this framework functions in a real-world environment, and considers the pros and cons of using an a-posteriori access control system in comparison with a preventive one in the context of electronic health records (EHR).

The paper also critiques previous work by Rissanen et al., which outlines a method for overriding decisions in a preventive access control system known as privilege calculus, whereas the authors propose an approach with minimal preventive controls that cannot be overridden, leaving the responsibility for auditing decisions to the auditors.

The authors note that in the existing literature, the proposed security policies, such as those by Halpern and Weissman which use first-order logic, are centralized and do not accommodate delegation, a limitation that audit logic does not share.

Additionally, the paper touches on the use of a-posteriori access control in digital rights management (DRM), highlighting a reputation-based trust management model by Shmatikov and Talcott that assesses agent reputations through compliance with DRM licenses. The authors suggest that trust management, paired with auditing, could be an effective approach for large, distributed EHR systems.

Policies in the proposed system are constructed using atomic predicates that define permissions or conditions. An example provided illustrates a basic permission predicate indicating ownership and a condition predicate demonstrating an agent's role, such as being a nurse. Complex policies are formulated using these fundamental elements and logical operators.

Finally, the process is mapped to the session layer for execution, where actions can be caught in an audit trail. The paper emphasizes the importance of secure logging devices to ensure that logged data is trustworthy and can be used as evidence in future audits.
