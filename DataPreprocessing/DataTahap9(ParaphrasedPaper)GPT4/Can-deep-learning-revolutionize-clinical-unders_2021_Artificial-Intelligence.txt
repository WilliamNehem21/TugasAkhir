The field of neuro-ophthalmology is increasingly benefiting from the use of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly with AI algorithms displaying impressive accuracy in the diagnosis of diseases such as papilledema and glaucoma. These AI programs are trained to detect neuro-ophthalmic conditions by assessing changes in the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness and the optic disc, utilizing images from fundus photography and optical coherence tomography (OCT). The potential for AI in this specialty is expanding, with particular interest in its application for hereditary optic nerve disorders, like Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON).

The paper also reflects on AI's broader impact in the field, noting its utility in recognizing age-related genetic and epigenetic modifications manifesting in patients over 50. AI has proven effective in identifying features like retinal pigmentation alterations and various signs of degeneration or damage when analyzing color fundus images.

Focusing on cataracts, which are characterized by a clouding of the eye's lens, the paper highlights the importance of early detection. AI, through deep learning (DL) techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), has been used to analyze slit-lamp images, aiding in the early identification of cataracts with about 70% accuracy when compared to traditional clinical assessments. Further advancements in AI have led to models achieving up to 97% sensitivity and specificity for detecting and grading cataracts, particularly in pediatric cases. AI has also shown an 87% accuracy in predicting the risk of posterior capsule opacification (PCO), another condition related to cataracts.

Advances in digital technology, including the Internet of Things, 5G networks, and autonomous AI ecosystems, are facilitating the expansion of AI in ophthalmology. This integration allows clinicians to perform remote evaluations and improves the ability to manage disease progression, harness longitudinal data, and compute real-time occurrence rates. AI's capacity to handle large datasets is transforming diagnostics and treatment in ophthalmology, with screening for disorders like diabetic retinopathy (DR), retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), glaucoma, and myopia being significantly enhanced by AI-supported tele-screening.

Despite these advancements, AI systems are not infallible; they can make errors that affect operations and diagnoses. Collecting and analyzing data while adhering to legal requirements presents significant challenges for future AI systems. Issues such as human error in establishing reference standards and potential bias in assessments underscore the need for extensive testing and validation of new AI algorithms and systems, which can be a lengthy process due to the necessity of multiple approvals. These challenges illustrate that while AI holds promise for improving the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosing ophthalmologic conditions, there is still substantial groundwork to be done before these technologies can be fully integrated and trusted in clinical practice.
