This academic paper outlines a set of models and procedures for analyzing the reliability of clocks and understanding Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks within the context of communication networks.

The paper describes a rule governing the state transition of a clock. A clock can be in either an operational state, represented as clock(t, c), or a broken state, as broken(t, c), with 't' standing for current time and 'c' for current battery charge. As the clock operates, its battery charge diminishes. A Bernoulli trial, with the success probability of c/1000.0, decides whether the clock remains operational or breaks down. The probability of success is directly linked to the battery charge, implying the clock is more likely to fail as the battery drains.

The authors discuss the inadequacy of the Dolev-Yao model for analyzing DoS properties, instead recommending the shared channel model. In this alternative approach, attackers and legitimate clients both have a probabilistic chance of accessing the server through a shared communication channel. This model does not give attackers full control over the channel but allows them to replay altered or counterfeit versions of legitimate packets at a specified maximum rate.

A process is outlined where a client, upon receiving an acknowledgment (ack[crec, cdscrd]) from the server while in a waiting state, switches to a connected state and ceases to send new messages. Any further acknowledgments received after the client is connected or has failed are disregarded.

To analyze various DoS-related properties, the authors employ the ASV model and use statistical quantitative model checking through tools like VESTA and Maude. This allows for running Monte Carlo simulations on the model to estimate the quantities of interest specified in QUATEX (Quantitative Temporal Expressions) formula declarations, with a desired confidence interval and threshold for experimental size.

The paper mentions specific values used in their experiments, such as a mean server processing rate (s) of 600 packets per time units, timeouts for both server (ts) and client (tc) at 0.4 time units, and an initial packet generation delay (initdelay) of 0.2 time units, unless specified otherwise.

Lastly, the authors mention that by using probabilistic rewrite theories, QUATEX formulas, and statistical model checking supported by tools like Maude and VESTA, they were able to apply their approach to the formal specification and verification of the ASV protocol, thereby enhancing assurance regarding the protocol's resistance to DoS attacks and its availability properties, which had previously been studied through analytic proofs or simulations.
