The goals of this paper are twofold: First, it extends the investigation into various forms of the classical Hausdorff Difference Hierarchy (DH). Secondly, it offers a detailed examination of a particular category of effective topological spaces previously mentioned in references [12,24], which plays an important role in both the analysis of DH and in the field of computable topology.

The paper summarizes concepts pertaining to countably based T0 spaces and the aspect of computability associated with these spaces. It acknowledges that while the ideas and results included are not entirely original, they represent small modifications or expansions of prior work referenced within, including an exercise 3.2.17 found in the literature.
