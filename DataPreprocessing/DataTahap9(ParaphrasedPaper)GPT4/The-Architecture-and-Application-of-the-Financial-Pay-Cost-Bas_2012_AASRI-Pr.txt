This academic paper presents a comprehensive campus card platform that integrates a series of student-focused systems, enabling features such as saving, spending, identity authentication, information inquiries, settlements, and management. The system allows for automatic deductions for various expenses and the distribution of scholarships, subsidies, and allowances to students. It also supports real-time statistics collection of fees and promotes information resource sharing through various inquiry and statistical features. The platform adheres to a safety-first principle to safeguard both funds and information.

To address the considerations for the digital campus environment, the authors propose a design focused on a financial payment system. Building on a multi-client/server (multi-C/S) architecture, the system includes a middle layer that acts as an intermediary between the client and the database. This layer validates requests, manages data access, and processes business rules, which limits the number of direct connections to the database server. As a result, client connections are no longer restricted and can be dynamically created and released. Modifications to business rules can largely be handled by updating the middle-tier server component, or in some cases, by simply altering a stored procedure in the database, preventing the need for client side changes. This configuration provides security, supports large-scale development, and prevents single points of failure by employing clusters of application and web servers. The system's network structure is segregated into storage, processing, and access networks to enhance network security through subnet isolation.

The paper also discusses a subsystem that consolidates user authentication with billing policies and access control permissions. This service-focused subsystem is designed for system administrators and offers features for bulk operations such as creating and renewing accounts. It allows for customized user information management and supports user account migrations within the campus network.

Another subsystem is tailored for user-level interactions, offering capabilities for changing user names and passwords. Through a self-service platform, users can access their history of payments and network usage, as well as manage their network services. New network users can pre-register through a campus portal interface, which helps ensure the accuracy of user information and reduces administrative workload.

Lastly, the main bank book module is responsible for communication between servers and data processing. It acts as a communications hub for the entire system and includes an interface for socket communications to validate information, an interface for database storage and transactions, and serial communication programs for microcontrollers, which are used to set up networked machines.

In summary, the paper elaborates on a networked student service platform that integrates financial aspects with management and information services to streamline campus operations and security.
