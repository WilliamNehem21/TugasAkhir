This research paper focuses on the concept of local irregularity within graphs and explores the decomposition of such graphs into locally irregular subgraphs. In the context of the study, a graph is locally irregular if every pair of neighboring nodes have different degrees. The paper explores the conditions under which a specific type of graph, known as a decomposable split graph, can be split into a collection of locally irregular subgraphs.

The key result presented in the paper is that any decomposable split graph with a clique size of at least 10 can be split into a maximum of three locally irregular subgraphs. Moreover, the researchers provide a full description of the scenarios in which the graph can be decomposed into just one or two such subgraphs.

The paper includes several important sections where specific lemmas are proven to support the main results. In section 2.1, they establish foundational lemmas, labeled as 2.3 and 2.4. These proofs begin with a specific way of coloring the edges of a complete graph (denoted as E(Kn)), which they refer to as a "normal" coloring, as introduced in definition 2.1. In the subsequent section, section 2.2, the authors prove another critical lemma, numbered 2.7, using a complex method that builds upon the initial concept of normal colorings.

Finally, the paper incorporates a particular finding involving normal colorings. It states that given the presence of a unique conflicting edge, when the number of vertices 'n' is even, one subgraph (denoted as Gblue) will be locally irregular while the other (denoted as Gred) will not, and vice versa when 'n' is odd. This implies that the property of being locally irregular oscillates between the two subgraphs depending on the parity of the number of vertices in the graph.
