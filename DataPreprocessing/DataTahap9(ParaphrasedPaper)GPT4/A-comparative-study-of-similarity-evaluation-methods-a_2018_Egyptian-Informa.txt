The structure of the paper is outlined as follows: Section 2 presents the foundational concepts and prior studies. Section 3 offers an in-depth examination of the time-weighted edit distance operator. Section 4 explores three methodologies—regression, interpolation, and curve barcoding—for assessing similarity. Section 5 appears to be missing. Section 6 details the conducted experiments and their subsequent results. The paper is concluded in Section 7 with a summary and suggestions for future research.

In this research, the precision of four different methods is assessed by looking at spatial similarity and its sensitivity to various data sampling rates. For the analysis, nine trains, one from each line, are selected from the trains dataset and are each sampled ten times, resulting in a total of 90 trajectories. Similarly, from the trucks dataset, 205 trajectories are selected and each resampled six times to create 1230 new trajectories. These final datasets include both the original trajectories and their sampled versions. Sampling rates vary by transportation mode since some sampling rates produce an insufficient number of observations (as in cubic interpolation, which requires at least four points).

The datasets were examined for similarities in space, direction, and speed. Following the evaluation of accuracy across various experiments, the findings indicated that interpolation achieves the highest average accuracy, with rates reaching 90%. As a recommendation for future research, there is a call for the development of an automated feature prediction tool—a generic continuous similarity operator—that would identify the most relevant similarity criteria based on the input data.
