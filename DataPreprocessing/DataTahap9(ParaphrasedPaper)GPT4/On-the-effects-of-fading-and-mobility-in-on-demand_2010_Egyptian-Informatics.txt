Abstract paraphrased:

An often-neglected factor when assessing the performance of ad hoc routing protocols is signal strength variability, or fading. Many routing protocols have been developed with oversimplified assumptions, overlooking the effects of fading by relying on unrealistic propagation models. However, propagation models greatly influence the evaluation of a routing protocol's performance, and thus, realistic models that incorporate the impact of fading are essential. This study conducts a comparative analysis of two demand-driven ad hoc routing protocols, examining the influence of both mobility and fading on their performance. Simulations compare non-fading models such as free space and two-ray ground to fading models like shadowing, Ricean, and Rayleigh fading. The findings indicate that fading models significantly deteriorate network performance across different mobility scenarios.

Details paraphrased:

Routing protocols for ad hoc networks depend on radio propagation which is hindered by various phenomena, such as reflection and scattering. Signal strength can fade due to multiple factors including distance, antenna configuration, and environmental obstacles. This paper presents a simulation-based investigative study into how mobility and various propagation models affect performance indicators like packet delivery ratio, delay, and routing overhead for two on-demand routing protocols. The results showed that incorporating fading propagation models into simulations notably altered outcomes.

The simulation was conducted on a Windows operating system using Cygwin. Fading models, which are not part of the NS-2 simulator by default, were integrated through C++ modifications to the wireless physical layer. Mobility patterns and communication were set up using Tcl scripts, which were then compiled to produce trace files detailing significant simulation events. These files were processed using AWK scripting for performance analysis.
