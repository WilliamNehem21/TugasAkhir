This academic paper discusses an improved visual detection and ranging (ViDAR) system, which is pivotal in identifying obstacles under emergency conditions. Initially, images are processed to reduce fog by networks that assess the transmission network and the airlight network, followed by further refinement. A network designed to detect key points is then employed to effectively pinpoint vehicles in the de-fogged images.

Chang S., Zhang Y., and their colleagues introduced an approach that integrates a spatial attention mechanism with a deep learning detection network for end-to-end training. They innovated by transforming radar data points into image format for neural network training, leveraging advancements in computer vision and machine learning.

M and Yamamoto K. contributed a model that calculates obstacle height from flat surfaces, factoring in the terrainâ€™s unevenness. Jung S., Cho Y., and others utilized the Harris detector to extract feature points and employed epipolar geometry to differentiate between the background and the foreground. These models rely on pixel changes to ascertain the target, which delivers more accuracy but also yields more feature points.

The structure of the paper is as follows: Section 2 presents the principles of the improved ViDAR system. Section 3 provides an overview of the enhanced ViDAR and its combination with machine learning for obstacle detection. Section 4 delves into the performance outcomes and analysis of the method proposed. Lastly, Section 5 offers conclusions and suggests avenues for future research.

In emergency scenarios, it's crucial to have the capability to detect unforeseen obstacles, which augments machine learning-based detection methods. The paper addresses the need for an alternative obstacle detection method based on motion compensation that sidesteps the typically resource-intensive feature extraction and matching processes. While the ViDAR system utilizing the Maximally Stable Extremal Regions (MSER)-based image region matching method can effectively discern unknown obstacles, as suggested in previous studies, there is room for enhancing the speed of detection.
