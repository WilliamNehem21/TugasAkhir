The academic paper discusses a multi-type methodology that offers enhanced modularity in the field of logic. This approach allows for incorporating the logic of "ia3" into analytic rules, which was previously unattainable. This flexibility paves the way for expanding the current theory to incorporate milder forms of rough algebras, like semi de Morgan algebras or general lattices, providing insights into the proof-theoretic elements of rough concept logics.

By using this methodology, rough algebra logics have been integrated into a broader framework of properly displayable logics. These logics are analyzed collectively, and various meta-theoretic results—such as semantic cut elimination, the finite embeddability property, and the finite model property—are uniformly applicable to vast subclasses. The modularity inherent in the proof-theoretic framework also facilitates systematic interactions between different logics, leading to new logic varieties, such as dynamic epistemic logics based on rough algebra logics.

Side note: The academic paper probably includes a section that outlines the approach for verifying the soundness of particular logic rules (referred to as D.A) with respect to the semantics of perfect elements in a heterogeneous algebraic system (denoted as HA). It seems to indicate that the rules' properties in D.A closely mirror those in other calculi designed using a similar multi-type methodology, which is why only an overview is provided rather than a detailed analysis.

Finally, the paper covers the verification of cut elimination and the subformula property for D.A. Just like in other proper display calculi, these features can be demonstrated through a meta-theorem inspired by Belnap's strategy for display calculi. This verification draws on previously established theorems that serve as a foundation for each D.A mentioned in the paper.
