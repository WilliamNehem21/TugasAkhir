The paper introduces a new technique to improve text recognition in degraded historical Indus script images by effectively separating text from non-text elements. The Indus script, often found on irregular surfaces and resembling ornamental shapes, poses a challenge for optical character recognizers (OCR) due to its complex background.

The method employs a combination of Sobel and Laplacian filters to enhance low-contrast pixels in the images. It then uses skeletonization to simplify text components, aiding in the structural analysis and reducing computational load. To distinguish between text and non-text components, the proposed approach analyzes the cursiveness and number of branches in the image skeletons, with less cursive components likely being text.

Additionally, the paper presents a nearest neighbor strategy to group components of the same line into clusters. These clusters are then classified as either text or non-text based on the features of text components, typically having fewer branches.

The proposed method was evaluated on a diverse dataset and demonstrated superior recall and precision when compared to existing methods. The research provided significant insights into the segmentation of text in Indus documents and suggested the potential to adapt the technique for other Indian scripts in the future, including improvements in character segmentation and recognition.

This summary focuses on the main contributions and findings of the paper, leaving out some mathematical details and specific comparisons for brevity.
