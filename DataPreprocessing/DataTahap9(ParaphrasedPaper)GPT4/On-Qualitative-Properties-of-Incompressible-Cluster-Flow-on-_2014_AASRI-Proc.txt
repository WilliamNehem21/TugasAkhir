The paper presents a computational model that simulates the movement of clusters around a circular network composed of an even number of segments, referred to as "rings." This model, known as the node model software, allows users to configure various parameters such as the placement of clusters, their size, and density, as well as the total number of rings comprising the network. An important aspect of the network is that adjacent nodes are distinguished by a line crossing their corresponding shapes.

Within the context of this model, the study explores the qualitative characteristics of non-compressible flows of cluster movements on the ring network, offering a comprehensive examination of these characteristics and the outcomes of simulations. The paper further asserts that if a cluster labeled "k2" is moving towards a shared node denoted as "b," then another cluster named "k1" must also pass through this node during the same time frame on account of the fact that cluster k2 is already occupying node "a." Consequently, since cluster k2 cannot simultaneously pass through and stop at node "b," this means cluster k1 is also unable to pass through node "a" at that moment.

The article includes the theoretical underpinnings, propositions, and proofs supporting these findings, making a significant contribution to validating the modeled behavior of clusters in ring networks through simulation.
