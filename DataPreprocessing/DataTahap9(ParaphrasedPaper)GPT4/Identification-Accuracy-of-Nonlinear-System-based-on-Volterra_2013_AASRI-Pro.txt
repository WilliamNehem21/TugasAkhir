Revised amplitudes for test signals have been established, and the model has been corroborated through experiments with a test object. Both linear and nonlinear models exhibit commendable precision. The proposed values significantly enhance the identification precision beyond the levels gained with previously recorded amplitudes and coefficients. The precision in identifying the test object's nonlinear characteristics improved by a factor of nearly 10, while the standard deviation in optimal scenarios did not exceed 5%.
