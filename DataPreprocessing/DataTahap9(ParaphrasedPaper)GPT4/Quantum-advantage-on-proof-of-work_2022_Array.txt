While various consensus mechanisms exist for maintaining blockchains, Proof of Work (PoW) currently dominates the market, with blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum representing over 90% of market share and a combined market cap exceeding $1.6 trillion as of November 2021. These figures underscore the vast financial resources managed by PoW blockchains and their critical consensus algorithms.

The paper proceeds to offer a detailed examination of PoW, concluding with a formal definition that facilitates rigorous mathematical scrutiny. It then examines the potential quantum computational edge in PoW, with implications for both adversarial and non-adversarial uses.

The research delves into the benefits of quantum computing for PoW, potential threats from quantum cyberattacks on blockchain networks, and the prospects of employing quantum advantage for more effective cryptocurrency mining.

The study also notes that networks like Bitcoin with high hashing power may be less susceptible to quantum attacks than smaller blockchains like Monero. Quantum computers not only offer a quadratic increase in efficiency over classical PoW systems, but they also present a significant threat capable of devastating cryptocurrency networks in the future.

Quantum supremacy in cryptocurrency mining does not require surpassing the entire network's power; it only needs to outperform individual classical miners in terms of cost efficiency per approved block, suggesting quantum dominance in this field may emerge sooner than predicted.

Mining rewards, variable across different cryptocurrencies and over time, are crucial in profitability assessments. For instance, Bitcoin's reward halving cycle, which decreases the block reward periodically, is an influential factor for long-term profitability.

As quantum miners become more common due to the quadratic advantage they hold, they are expected to eventually eclipse classical miners. This continuous influx of quantum miners, responding to the increased profitability, will in turn accelerate PoW difficulty adjustments, fuelling a cycle that propels the adoption of quantum mining.

The paper posits that quantum mining presents a security upside: once the majority of miners utilize quantum computing, the network is no longer vulnerable to quantum-based 51% attacks. While still possible, such attacks would need alternative strategies beyond quantum superiority.

Over time, due to the escalating difficulty of PoW, classical miners will become infeasible compared to quantum miners. Quantum computing's exponential benefits will gradually render them the only cost-effective option for miners.

Quantum computing offers clear benefits for PoW calculations. Although the likelihood of quantum-powered 51% attacks on cryptocurrencies is a distant threat, it remains a potential risk for the future.
