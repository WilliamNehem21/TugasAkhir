Theorem 3.3 represents the most constructive result achievable without incorporating a principle that is compatible with standard models (such as intuitionistic, recursive, classical) of constructive mathematics but seems unattainable through intuitionistic logic and the axiom of dependent choice alone. Under additional assumptions, Theorem 3.3 can be enhanced to confirm the uniform continuity of a designated type of continuous function, denoted by f.

The proof that continuous functions from compact metric spaces into metric spaces are uniformly continuous is straightforward using classical logic based on Theorem 3.3. Similarly, a classic result regarding uniform convergence can also be derived using Proposition 2.3, though this requires further definitions and context.
