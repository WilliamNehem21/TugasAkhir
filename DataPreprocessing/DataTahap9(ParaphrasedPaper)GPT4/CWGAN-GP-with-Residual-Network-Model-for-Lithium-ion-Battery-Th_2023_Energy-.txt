The paper addresses the growth of installed capacities in energy storage, noting significant expansion in pumped storage energy, which for the first time is less than 80% of the cumulative capacity, while lithium-ion batteries dominate with a growth rate above 85%. The role of AI is highlighted as being crucial to improving efficiency and safety in lithium-ion battery thermal management.

The research focuses on developing a novel Synthetic Thermal Convolutional-Memory Network (STCMN) combining Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM) with Temporal Convolution Networks (TCN), supporting diagnostics in the presence of noise. A computational fluid dynamics simulation via FLUENT software guides the input of STCMN, which includes voltage, state of charge (SOC), and thermal imaging of batteries. Field experiments confirm infrared thermography as a powerful method for assessing thermal behavior in batteries, offering quick, non-invasive analysis closer to actual thermal power than traditional thermocouples.

The paper critiques various generative methods in image generation, such as Variational Autoencoder (VAE), Deep Belief Network (DBN), and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), recognizing the latter's superiority in sample learning and practical applications.

Experiments with a 10Ah prismatic LiFePO4-graphite battery via simulation data are mentioned, showing improved metrics after augmenting the dataset, highlighting the benefits of using CWGAN-GP with ResNet for data augmentation in fault detection within lithium-ion batteries.

The research points to a gap in using GANs for augmenting faulty samples in lithium-ion battery thermal imaging and sets out future goals. These include improving the quality of generated thermal fault images and collecting real thermal images of faulty batteries to validate the efficacy of the CWGAN-GP with ResNet approach in practical scenarios.
