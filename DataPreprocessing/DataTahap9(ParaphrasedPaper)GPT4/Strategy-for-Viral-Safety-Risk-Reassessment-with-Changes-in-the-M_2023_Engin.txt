In the production of biopharmaceuticals, there is a crucial quality management system in place that aims to mitigate the risks posed by viruses, which includes three primary actions: prevention of virus entry, testing for viruses, and removing or inactivating any viruses present.

Prevention focuses on minimizing the risk of viral contamination from raw materials and cell lines used in production. Testing targets critical stages of the production process, including end-of-production cells, the lifespan of cells in culture, and the bulk product before further processing. The clearance part of the strategy is responsible for proving that the production methods are both powerful and reliable in eliminating viral contamination, which is validated through specific viral clearance studies.

The validity of these viral clearance studies is highly dependent on how well the samples represent the actual product. Two critical factors influencing sample representativeness are the physicochemical properties of the drug substance (e.g., isoelectric point, glycosylation pattern, impurity profile) and characteristics of process intermediates (e.g., protein concentration, buffer composition, retrovirus-like particle levels). In robust processes like low-pH treatment or nanofiltration, general characterization studies may be sufficient, but in more variable operations such as chromatography, thorough comparative analyses are necessary.

Specific attributes such as the protein concentration, pH, and conductivity of samples need attention during analysis to simulate the worst-case scenarios accurately—for example, higher pH and conductivity for anion exchange chromatography but a higher protein concentration for hydrophobic interaction chromatography. This approach ensures that the validation studies account for the most challenging conditions the production process might encounter.

Moreover, the experimental designs for viral safety must consider various operational factors like pressure limits on virus filters, which can differ depending on the filter supplier, and the potential effects when the process is stopped or paused. The complexity increases with chromatographic processes, where factors like conductivity can differently impact the removal of viruses based on the chromatography mode—higher conductivity usually means less virus reduction in flow-through mode, but the reverse in bind-and-elute mode. Also, the time the sample spends in the column relative to the flow rate can affect outcomes.

Guidance from ICH Q5A(R1) helps in selecting model viruses for validation studies based on the characteristics of the process and properties of potential viruses. Recent trends show a shift in the host cell substrates used by manufacturers for economic reasons, which necessitates a risk assessment for viral contaminants specific to the new host cells, adjusting model virus choices accordingly (e.g., using baculovirus for SF-9 cells and adding murine leukemia virus for CHO cells).
