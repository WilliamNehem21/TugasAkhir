The process of evaluating patient leakage current is split into two distinct assessments. The first assesses the current flowing through the parts in contact with the patient and from the medical device to the patient, while the second assesses the current that could potentially flow if an external voltage source caused a potential difference at the patient's side.

For the initial examination, all the parts that contact the patient are linked together, and the measurement instrument is connected in such a way that it lies between the device's protective earth (ground) and the interconnected patient-contacting electrodes.

For the second examination, an external voltage is applied to the electrodes via the test apparatus. Additionally, the measurement device is inserted between the power supply and the protective earth to determine if any leakage current passes through this path.

Specific emphasis is placed on devices that are powered internally and have accessible metallic parts; in these cases, the patient leakage current should be assessed between the electrodes and a selected point on the device's housing, positioning the terminals of the measurement device accordingly to capture this reading.
