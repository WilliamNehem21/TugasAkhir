This academic paper outlines a framework to utilize the Object Constraint Language (OCL) across various metamodels. The authors propose a system of interfaces that acts as a connecting bridge, allowing a singular OCL library consisting of a parser, analyzer, evaluator, and code generator to be employed with different metamodels. They have developed bridge implementations for three metamodels, enhancing OCL support for Java, the Kernel MetaModeling Framework (KMF), and the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF). The authors highlight the intention to upgrade the KMF bridge to UML 2.0, emphasizing that their architecture simplifies such updates.

The paper discusses the use of an LALR grammar for an unambiguous parser that creates an abstract syntax tree representing the input text. The AST serves as a structural representation of the input, linking grammar rules to tree nodes. However, to give meaning to the syntax, a semantic context is necessary, composed of the user model (e.g., UML) and a specification of the 'self' variable type in the model. The authors critique the standard's abstract syntax model as misleading, containing both syntax and semantic information, and they suggest the term "OCL semantic model" would be more accurate.

In examining the standard, the authors identify certain limitations with collection and tuple types not being subtypes of OCLAny and argue for the benefits of recognizing them as such for enhancing expressiveness and usability in OCL. They also describe how their proposed bridge implementations address various challenges, such as working with Java's limitations regarding enums, typed collections, and package concepts. Moreover, the authors touch upon the importance of CASE tools providing robust support for OCL, including syntax analysis, error reporting, and semantic analysis.

Overall, the paper recommends a modular approach to toolsets that support OCL to make the language more versatile and useful across different modeling environments. The authors reference related works to underline the need for such tools and the existing efforts in that direction.
