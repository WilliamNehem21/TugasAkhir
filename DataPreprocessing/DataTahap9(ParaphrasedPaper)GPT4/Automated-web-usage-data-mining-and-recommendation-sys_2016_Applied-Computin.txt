The central challenge faced by many online websites is the overload of choices presented to users, which makes the search for the right product or information difficult and time-consuming. This paper introduces a study of an automatic web usage data mining and recommendation system utilizing current user clickstream data on a newly developed RSS reader website. The system aims to provide personalized information without explicit user requests. Using the K-Nearest-Neighbor (KNN) classification method, the system identifies clients' clickstream data in real-time, associates it with specific user groups, and delivers tailored browsing options. The approach involves processing users' RSS address files through extraction, cleansing, formatting, and grouping into sessions, subsequently developing a data mart. Results indicate that the KNN classifier offers a transparent, consistent, straightforward, and simple solution.

Multiple data mining techniques exist, and the most suitable one for a given task must be determined. An integrated approach combining various methods can enhance a comprehensive data mining system. Techniques for data classification include decision trees, Bayesian classifiers, KNN, and rule-based classifiers. The paper focuses on the KNN classification method as the most appropriate.

Different models are discussed: Decision Tree using the CART method, SOM for modeling customer navigation, and Bayesian classifiers for accident modelingâ€”with the latter proving superior to statistical methods. The KNN algorithm highlighted in this paper is considered straightforward and competitive. Data preprocessing is crucial for the model's success, requiring relevant entries from the webserver logs.

The paper concludes with an evaluation of the recommendation system based on the KNN model, showing its efficacy in predicting classes and offering recommendations for users with unknown classes.
