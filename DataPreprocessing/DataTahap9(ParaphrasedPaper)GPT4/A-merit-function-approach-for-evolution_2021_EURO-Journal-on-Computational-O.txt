In this paper, the authors present an extension of globally convergent evolution strategies to address general constrained optimization problems, encompassing both quantifiably relaxable (QR) constraints and unrelaxable (UR) constraints. The authors use a merit function framework to manage QR constraints and adopt either an extreme barrier function or projection method for UR constraints. They demonstrate that under certain conditions, their proposed methods assure global convergence to first order stationarity for the constraints.

The paper draws upon previous work from Diouane (2014), using a merit function inspired by Fletcher and Leyffer (2002), to evaluate trial steps within the evolution strategy algorithm. The approach aims to combine methods for handling feasibility (e.g., extreme barrier or projection for UR constraints) with the merit function for QR constraints.

If a feasible starting point cannot be found for a problem, it remains unsolved and convergence tests are not applicable. To assess the methods, the authors perform numerical experiments using up to 3000 function evaluations and run stochastic solvers 20 times to obtain median performance data.

Two MATLAB-implemented algorithms, called ES-MF, are introduced, with parameters based on previous work by Diouane et al. (2015b). These methods are compared to the DDS-MF method (Gratton and Vicente, 2014), which also handles QR constraints using a merit function within a directional direct search approach, and CSA-AL (Atamna et al., 2018), which handles QR constraints using an augmented Lagrangian method with a CMA-ES optimizer.

The study finds that using the merit function approach ES-MF generally outperforms the extreme barrier approach, especially with smaller computational budgets, emphasizing the benefit of constraint relaxation.

In conclusion, the paper proposes a set of globally convergent evolution strategy algorithms that use a merit function to control point distribution, along with a restoration procedure that activates when improvements in constraint violations occur. This method extends previous work by integrating quantifiable relaxable constraints, and the convergence analysis developed takes into account the frequency of entering the restoration phase.
