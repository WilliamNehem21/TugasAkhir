A neural network was utilized to estimate the solubility of CO2 in various ionic liquids, incorporating data from 728 experiments across 14 unique ionic liquids. The model established solubility based on critical properties of pure substances, as well as pressure and temperature factors. This model achieved a high correlation coefficient of R² = 0.9336, surpassing those of the Peng-Robinson equation of state (PR-EOS) at R² = 0.7323 and the Soave-Redlich-Kwong equation of state (SRK-EOS) at R² = 0.6989, as per Baghban et al. (2016a,b). Additionally, other models were crafted for predicting factors such as air dew point and the formation of hydrates.

Neural networks were also employed to estimate the enthalpy of vaporization based on factors such as boiling temperature, specific gravity, and molecular weight. In the field of reservoir simulation, artificial intelligence can be trained using a specified numerical model to create a fast-evaluating proxy. This proxy can enhance production optimization and evaluate uncertainty efficiently through a multitude of Monte Carlo simulation iterations.

Deep learning techniques prove beneficial in calculating multiphase flow rates within functioning wells, using production history data. These AI approaches have demonstrated sufficient accuracy to support real-time monitoring systems. Another innovative approach is a physics-informed neural network (PINN), which acts as a meshless reservoir model, providing precise outcomes in complex-dimensional challenges, which can be advantageous over traditional simulation techniques.

Wang et al. (2019a,b) designed a neural network to estimate the bubble point in hydrocarbon mixtures, which can serve as an initial estimate in a two-phase flash algorithm. By substituting the traditional stability test with the neural network's bubble point prediction, the total time spent on reservoir simulation decreased by 30%.

However, it's important to note that the Wilson correlation often results in poor estimates under high-pressure situations; using it directly in flash calculations can lead to divergent results, particularly because it fails to smoothly connect calculations involving the stability test.

Gas injection, used for the recovery of liquid hydrocarbons, adds complexity to reservoir simulations by altering the overall composition of reservoir fluids. This change can cause significant shifts in phase conditions, such as transitioning from oil to gas in only one simulation step near an injection well, necessitating stability tests at every step to adjust for changes in composition and pressure.
