The academic paper provides the following arguments and proofs:

1. From Lemma 3.9, it is established that there exists a nondeterministic PSPACE algorithm for the problem in question. Invoking Savitch's Theorem, it follows that there is also a deterministic algorithm capable of solving the problem within polynomial space (PSPACE).

2. The proof shifts focus to the reachability problem in Petri nets with S-variants, aiming to demonstrate that it is PSPACE-hard. It references a method from Cheng, Esparza, and Palsberg, which involves a reduction from the Quantified Boolean Formulas Satisfiability (QBF-SAT) problem to the reachability problem in 1-safe Petri nets. This reduction is employed here to affirm that the resulting net consists of S-variants, thereby proving the necessary hardness.

3. The functioning of the net named NG is explained: starting with a token in the place indicating the initiation of testing, assignments of Boolean values to variables are represented by tokens in places, culminating in the placement of a token to represent the Boolean outcome of the formula tested.

4. The proof claims that the net NG contains S-variants, by establishing that each transition is progressive via solving linear programming problems for semi-positive T-invariants, and examining structural boundedness post-removal of these transitions. This is pertinent because it can be executed in polynomial time.

5. It illustrates the initial firing of transitions and the resulting token flow in the net N0, leading to a token in the final place E0 and a doubling of tokens in C0.

6. To confirm the partial boundedness of net Ni, it is necessary to show that the firings of non-progressive transitions are limited by a function of the firings of progressive transitions and the size of the input. The paper discusses the important role played by a set of places and presents a notation simplification in which Ci represents a set of places from P0 to Ci.

7. The paper continues by examining the firing conditions for various transitions such as V0, W0, and X0, and how those conditions are dependent on other transitions like X1, R1, and T1. Proposition B.5 is utilized to identify the bounds on the number of times these transitions can fire.

8. This analysis contributes to identifying the degree to which various elements in the Petri net are (partially) bounded, thereby progressing toward establishing the PSPACE-hardness of the reachability problem in Petri nets with S-variants.
