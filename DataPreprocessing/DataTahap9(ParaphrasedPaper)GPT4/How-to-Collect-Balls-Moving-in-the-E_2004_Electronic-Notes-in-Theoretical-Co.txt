This paper investigates the task of using k robots to collect n balls that are moving at constant velocities on a Euclidean plane. The robots themselves can only move along straight lines that pass through the origin. The research aims to address three key problems: 1) determining whether all balls can be collected by k robots, 2) maximizing the number of balls collected by a given number of k robots, and 3) finding the minimum number of robots needed to collect all n balls. These problems are explored under different conditions, such as whether the robots' paths are predetermined or chosen freely, and whether these paths are uniform or distinct.

The issues presented are approached in the context of real-world scenarios, such as resupply operations at sea or intercepting mobile ground units with aircraft. This study extends the concept of the classic Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), often studied as the Moving-Target TSP or Kinetic TSP, where unlike the classical TSP where objects are stationary, in the Moving-Target TSP the balls are moving.

The paper clarifies that the Moving-Target TSP inherits the computational complexity of the classical TSP, known to be NP-hard, and adds the additional difficulty of dealing with moving targets. However, it challenges the usual assumption that robots can always collect all balls because they move faster, by considering scenarios where robots either can't move as fast or have restricted movement, such as being limited to move on straight lines.

The body of the paper is organized into several sections: Sections 2 and 3 examine the ball collecting problems (BCPs) when the robots' paths, or track-lines, are predetermined. Section 2 looks at the case where all track-lines are identical, while Section 3 deals with cases where they differ. Section 4 considers BCPs when the track-lines are not fixed in advance, and Section 5 concludes the work and touches upon future extensions of the study.

The researchers tackle the foundational problem of a single robot collecting all n balls first by excluding balls that either never cross or always remain on the robot's track-line, since they cannot be collected or need no effort to collect, respectively. They present Theorem 2.1, demonstrating that it's possible to determine if all balls can be collected by a robot on a given track-line and compute a schedule for this task, both in O(n log n) time.

For the case with more than one robot, the paper shows that the problem of minimizing the number of robots to catch all balls can likewise be solved using similar algorithms in O(n log n) time, drawing connections to the minimum cost integral flow problems in network flows.

In Theorem 4.5, the authors reveal that one can determine if there's a possible track-line that would enable a single robot to collect all balls and create the corresponding robot schedule; this is possible within a complexity of O(n^2 log n) time.

Overall, the paper provides both algorithms and complexity analyses to explore the tractability of various ball collecting problems in the Euclidean plane, indicating where polynomial time solutions exist and where the problems are computationally intractable.
