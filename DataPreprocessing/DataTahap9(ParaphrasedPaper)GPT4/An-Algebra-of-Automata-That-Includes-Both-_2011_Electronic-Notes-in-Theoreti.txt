The academic paper discusses an advanced framework that integrates quantum elements into the model, allowing for a detailed and systematic representation of how quantum protocols function. By including components that are finite state and classical by nature, the authors argue that the description of quantum protocols is enhanced, gaining in both clarity and precision.

Furthermore, the paper talks about qubit automata, which are specific types of computational automata corresponding to a quantum bit system (a two-level quantum system characterized by the state space of C^2). The authors focus on explaining three distinct qubit automata needed for the discussion on quantum teleportation. Among these automata, one functions independently as a quantum automaton, while the others are used together to construct a more complex, two-qubit quantum automaton.
