Cotton is a significant agricultural commodity for farmers around the world, with developed nations typically using mechanical harvesters and developing nations relying on manual labor. Hand-picking preserves the quality of the cotton fibers and results in lower contamination but presents health risks from pesticides and is laborious and time-intensive. As farm labor decreases and costs rise, the need for mechanical harvesting is growing, yet current machines, being non-selective, fall short compared to the manual method.

To address this, researchers aimed to create efficient, lightweight CNN models for more accuracy in cotton boll segmentation, reducing errors, and lowering time spent in this process. Existing CNNs had less than 80% accuracy in this task. The researchers assessed their models using various evaluation metrics and compared them with existing advanced networks.

Section 2 of the paper outlines how the image dataset was prepared and the methodology for CNN model development, including training and performance criteria. Section 3 presents the results of the CNN models, and Section 4 concludes the study.

The researchers described image collection, labeling, preprocessing, and augmentation, then detailed the development of three new CNN architectures and their training. They emphasized the importance of the activation function and weight initialization for network convergence. They used the ReLU activation function and He initialization, considering the layer dimensions and CNN architecture, which includes an encoder and decoder.

The research leveraged the Keras deep learning API with TensorFlow as a backend, and Google Colaboratory for training. They observed that increasing dropout rates diminished mean intersection over union (IoU) values and reduced model performance due to the spatial correlation within cotton field images, supporting findings of earlier studies.

The developed models, despite a lower number of parameters compared to state-of-the-art networks, achieved promising mean IoU percentages, signifying that lightweight models can provide near-comparable accuracy with much greater parameter efficiency in cotton boll segmentation tasks.
