The article presents a new approach in the realm of non-classical logics, specifically addressing the challenge of integrating different non-classical logic systemsâ€”modal logic with many-valued logics. The primary focus is to model various dimensions of human reasoning, such as belief, knowledge, obligations, vagueness, and inconsistency, for applications in theoretical computer science and AI.

The paper introduces a modal expansion of paraconsistent Nelson logic and generalizes Belnapian modal logic as formulated by Odintsov and Wansing. The authors provide algebraic completeness theorems for the introduced logics and articulate the corresponding algebraic semantics through axioms. They also extend existing representation results of paraconsistent Nelson logic by demonstrating how these algebras can be represented using twist-structures.

The paper is structured to first lay the groundwork with a discussion on paraconsistent Nelson logic before moving on to the new modal expansion. The authors aim to establish a general system that encompasses all forms of Belnapian modal logics and ensure its algebraic robustness. The new logic, intended to be as general as possible, requires certain rules to be established for the authors to achieve algebraic completeness.

Not all modal expansions of paraconsistent Nelson logic align with the authors' logic, which suggests that finding a minimal modal expansion for this type of logic remains an open problem. The potential for an algebraic semantics with twist-structure representation for this minimal expansion is a topic the authors plan to explore in future work.

Additional areas for future research are mentioned, such as a closer algebraic investigation of mn4-lattices to understand better how certain subsets of full-twist structures relate to these lattices. This question is similar to problems already addressed for other types of lattices in the cited literature. The paper concludes by highlighting open questions and suggests directions for continued research in this field.
