This academic paper investigates the levels of heavy metals (Cu, Zn, Pb, Cd, Fe, and Mn) in various tissues (liver, gills, and muscles) of fourteen benthic and pelagic fish species from three different locations (Shalateen, Hurghada, and Suez) along the Egyptian Red Sea. The researchers observed notable differences in metal accumulation between fish species and organs. As typically found, the muscle tissue contained the lowest levels of metals, with the liver prominently accumulating Cu, Zn, and Fe, whereas Pb and Mn were mostly found in the gills. The variance among species suggests that factors such as age, habitat, and species-specific traits impact metal uptake.

Fish is known as a nutritious food, offering essential nutrients such as proteins, minerals, vitamins, and omega-3 fatty acids. Organizations like the American Heart Association recommend consuming fish twice a week for these benefits. However, their position in the food chain means fish can accumulate heavy metals, which can negate health benefits and lead to issues such as renal failure, liver damage, cardiovascular diseases, or even death. Consequently, international monitoring programs track fish quality and ecosystem health.

While most previous studies have focused on metal content in fish muscles, this work goes further by examining other organs, revealing differential heavy metal distribution across them. The concentration patterns reflect the various roles different tissues play in metal storage and metabolism. For example, the liver stores essential metals due to its metabolic function, while gills, being a site for ion exchange, tend to accumulate metals directly from the water.

The study also attempts to determine whether benthic (bottom-dwelling) fish might show higher metal levels than pelagic (open water) species due to their sediment contact and feeding habits. However, findings do not consistently support this hypothesis. Fish migratory patterns suggest that organ metal content reflects local environmental conditions, with species from Suez showing particularly elevated metal concentrations, likely due to industrial and shipping activities.

They found that essential metals were below permissible limits for human consumption. However, Pb levels were at or slightly above the limits set by some authorities, and Cd levels in pelagic fish from Suez exceeded certain guidelines, warranting continuous monitoring.

Comparatively, the metal concentrations reported in this study were generally lower or within the ranges found in similar regional studies. The risk analysis indicates that the metal levels in fish muscles are safe for human consumption according to international standards, with a note that continuous observation is necessary, particularly for species that tend to accumulate metals from more polluted waters.

The research suggests that metal concentrations in fish from the Egyptian Red Sea are within expected ranges for safe consumption but varying environmental conditions necessitate ongoing monitoring, especially in areas at risk for pollution.
