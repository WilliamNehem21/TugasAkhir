In the study of quantum channel behavior, which is key to creating effective error correction strategies and verifying security protocols, the conventional method of analysis is typically mathematical. However, this paper advocates for the use of a more straightforward probabilistic model checking approach, which aligns better with classical frameworks for evaluating how quantum channel noise impacts security. Additionally, the paper scrutinizes various eavesdropping methods from a security standpoint.

Quantum information theory has shown the potential to perform tasks that are impossible with classical technologies alone. Quantum cryptography exemplifies one such advancement, enabling the secure transmission of messages between two parties with a security level that is not solely based on computational complexity. In this context, quantum channels and qubits are harnessed to transfer classical bits of encryption keys, and this process can either occur alongside a traditional communication medium or through the quantum channel itself.

To address channel noise and imperfections, researchers have applied a probabilistic modeling strategy and constructed a straightforward model, which they have tested using PRISM software. Their findings are in line with those of ideal, noise-free channels, and the comparison of different interception techniques is consistent with other research. The structure of the paper is such that a description of the quantum channel model is found in Section 2, while Section 3 provides an overview of the PRISM model checker, including the simulation details and results. The conclusion of the paper is presented in Section 4.

The unpredictable nature of quantum phenomena has led to the recommendation of using suitable probabilistic tools, like PRISM, to verify quantum protocols rather than employing traditional logical model-checkers such as SPIN. PRISM, in particular, has certain benefits for analyzing the BB84 quantum key distribution protocolâ€”a model that was also utilized by the protocol's creators. An analysis by Papanikolaou using PRISM of the BB84 protocol is discussed, considering two types of attacks in a theoretical, perfect channel without noise or device flaws.
