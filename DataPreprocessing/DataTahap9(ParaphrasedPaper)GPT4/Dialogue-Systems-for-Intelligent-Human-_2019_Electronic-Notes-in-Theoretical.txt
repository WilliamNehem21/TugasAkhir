The core method of interaction in communication technologies relies on dialogues that encompass speech, gestures, and semantic and pragmatic understanding. There has been significant research into dialogue management, with a focus on creating standardized models for goal-oriented applications through machine learning and deep learning techniques. The paper reviews current methodologies for training dialogue managers, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. Additionally, it introduces an innovative image-based technique applied to the Facebook bAbI Task 1 dataset in an out-of-vocabulary scenario. The findings demonstrate that treating dialogues as images results in effective performance and helps dialogue managers to handle out-of-vocabulary tasks better than memory networks.

Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is increasingly integrated into our environment, notably for intelligent spaces. Designing ICT solutions for elderly users, who may be skeptical about new technologies, presents unique challenges. Enhancing Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) with ICT solutions requires natural interaction and emotional intelligence.

Avatars offer a means of face-to-face interaction, providing a human-like representation that can improve acceptance of the technology. The use of avatars carries significant benefits; they can perform gestures that enhance comprehension and combine visual cues with voice for enriched communication, akin to natural speech. Ensuring consistency between visual and vocal outputs is crucial.

Text-to-speech (TTS) systems can transform replies generated by the dialogue manager, a component separate from the Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and TTS systems, into speech. These systems complement the dialogue manager to form a complete dialogue solution.

The paper is organized into six sections: an introduction to dialogue systems and embodied interaction; discussion of existing rule-based and machine learning dialogue models; a description of the proposed dialogue system methodology; preliminary results and discussions; and conclusions.

Research shows that embodied interactions can enhance engagement with ICT systems. For example, Bickmore et al. created a virtual laboratory to investigate the long-term engagement of elderly users with a virtual exercise coach, yielding positive results.

Historically, the first chatbot, ELIZA, was based on a rule-based system that used pattern matching to respond to user inputs. Rule-based systems model dialogues as states, with the dialogue manager selecting appropriate responses from a predefined rule set. While such systems maintain conversation control and consistency, they are limited in their adaptability and scalability.

Reinforcement Learning (RL), a machine learning technique where the agent learns to maximize rewards, has seen advances with the inclusion of deep learning techniques, demonstrating superior performance in complex games. Dialogue systems modeled as Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) face challenges with the high-dimensional state and action spaces. To address this, researchers explore different solutions like Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL), which abstracts problems into hierarchies that simplify decision-making processes.

Lastly, the paper discusses an approach where dialogues are converted into images using the Xception vision model on the Facebook bAbI dataset Task 1. This method processes dialogues as images for binary classification, with promising results in terms of managing out-of-vocabulary dialogue tasks.
