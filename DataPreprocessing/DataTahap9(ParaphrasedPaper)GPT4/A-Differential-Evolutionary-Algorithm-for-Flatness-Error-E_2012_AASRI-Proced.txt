The paper introduces a new Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm to assess flatness errors using the minimum zone evaluation method. This approach is a heuristic, population-based optimization tactic that outperforms traditional methods in efficiency and robustness. The paper establishes objective function calculations for planar errors that adhere to the ISO standard and are derived from the minimum zone definition.

According to Y14.5 and ISO standards, the ideal geometric feature of a component's form tolerance should be assessed based on the minimum zone concept, which for flatness is the smallest distance between two parallel planes encompassing all data points.

Commonly, techniques like the Least Squares Method (LSM) are favored for geometric error evaluation because of their ease of implementation and computational efficiency, particularly in Coordinate Measuring Machines (CMMs). Nevertheless, LSM may overestimate form tolerances, potentially leading to the rejection of acceptable parts since it does not always provide the minimum zone solution required by the ISO standard.

The paper details mechanism of the DE, which includes reinitializing trial vector parameters falling outside of bounds and evaluates their objective function values. Then, a selection process optimizes the trial vectors.

The newly proposed DE algorithm is simpler and more flexible compared to traditional methods. It effectively searches for the optimal solution for flatness error evaluation and is suitable for use in CMMs. Practical examples provided demonstrate the algorithm's applicability in industrial settings and its prowess in finding efficient solutions that meet form error evaluation standards.
