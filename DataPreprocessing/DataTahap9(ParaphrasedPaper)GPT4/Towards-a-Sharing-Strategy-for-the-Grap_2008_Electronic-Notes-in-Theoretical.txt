In this paper, the authors introduce a methodology designed to enhance the graph rewriting calculus by incorporating a reduction strategy that prioritizes the preservation of sharing information within terms for as long as possible. They demonstrate that the developed reduction relation is both confluent and complete with respect to the small-step semantics inherent to the graph rewriting calculus.

The core principle of the suggested strategy is to restrict the application of substitution rules. These rules should only be used when they are necessary to create new redexes—that is, reducible expressions—for either the fundamental operations or for matches within the calculus. Notably, any substitutions that do not lead to the formation of new basic or matching redexes will not be executed. As a result, this strategy will effectively increase the number of terms that are considered to be in their normal form, meaning no further reductions can be made.

The paper illustrates a derivation that is deemed valid under the "sharingstrat" strategy they propose. This is evidenced by the presence of a cyclic substitution step that transforms a pre-redex into a basic redex, thus allowing a substitution rule to be applied in accordance with the strategy's definition.

In a particular instance provided, "ctx[]" is used to denote an application and can take the form of either "ctx'[] g'" or "g' ctx'[]". If "ctx'[x]" does not represent a freely constrained variable, the conclusion can be drawn using an inductive hypothesis, leading to the conclusion that "ctx[]" is equivalent to the application "g'".

The authors of the paper, H. Cirstea, C. Kirchner, L. Liquori, and B. Wack, presented their research at the Third International Workshop on Reduction Strategies in Rewriting and Programming, which took place in Valencia, Spain, in June 2003, and was included in the Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science journal as part of the event's academic proceedings.
