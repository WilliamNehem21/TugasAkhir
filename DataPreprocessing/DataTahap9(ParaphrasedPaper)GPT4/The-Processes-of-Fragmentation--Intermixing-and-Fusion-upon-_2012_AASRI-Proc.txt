The paper discusses the investigation of explosion welding mechanisms for dissimilar metal joints, including copper-tantalum and iron-silver. The research reveals that interfaces created during this process are irregular, featuring cusps and areas of local melting. It highlights the significant role of granulating fragmentation, which breaks down the materials into fine particles, serving as a primary pathway for energy dissipation during welding.

For metal pairs with normal solubility, the areas of local melting form true solutions, whereas for metals without mutual solubility, a colloidal solution is formed. Solidification of the emulsion may threaten joint integrity by causing potential delamination, but in contrast, suspension can enhance the joint by promoting dispersion hardening.

The paper also outlines observations of un-melted zones within the transition region of copper-tantalum joints characterized by severe plastic deformation resulting in structures like cell formation, stripes, high dislocation density, and recrystallization.

Different welding regimes applied to copper-tantalum joints demonstrate variance in the interface's shape—either waveless or wavy—yet both exhibit inhomogeneities such as cusps and local melting zones.

Granulating fragmentation, described in the paper, is distinct from traditional fragmentation associated with severe plastic deformation that involves dislocation, twinning, and recrystallization. Both fragmentation types occur at different proximities to the interface, with granulating fragmentation nearer and traditional fragmentation slightly further away.

The practical application of the research is indicated by the development of a chemical reactor vessel made from a carbon steel-copper-tantalum composite via explosion welding. The tantalum inner layer offers corrosion resistance, crucial for reactor design. Carbon steel forms the outer shell, with copper as an interlayer to avoid the formation of brittle phases that could occur if carbon steel and tantalum were welded directly. Welding parameters and morphologies differ between this application and the current investigation.
