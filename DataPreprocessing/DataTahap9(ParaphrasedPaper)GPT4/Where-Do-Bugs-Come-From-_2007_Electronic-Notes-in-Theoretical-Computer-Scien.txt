An investigation into bug databases for software indicates a significant discrepancy in failure rates among various software components. However, identifying common characteristics shared by these components that are prone to failure remains challenging. Our research involved examining the Eclipse project's bug and version histories to correlate failures with specific software components. The data we compiled presents the defect rates across all Eclipse components, potentially aiding in the identification of traits that can predict a component's likelihood of containing defects.

Our findings so far suggest that the type of problem a component addresses is the most significant indicator of its defect density. This is based on the straightforward realization that certain areas of software development inherently carry higher risks of failure. For example, in our experiences with the Eclipse codebase, we've noticed that tasks involving compiler internals tend to be more complex and susceptible to errors compared to developing user interfaces. This trend seems to hold true irrespective of the developers involved, the programming languages used, or the complexity of the code created.

Typically, software bugs stemming from interfacing with other components are the result of not adhering to those components' constraints. For instance, when examining the internal structures of a compiler, particularly its abstract syntax tree (AST), we encounter a vast array of constraints that mirror the syntactic and semantic rules of the programming language it represents.

To identify the implicit constraints within a component, we need to scrutinize the component for instances of proper use, as well as its consumer interactions to understand standard usage patterns. We have to develop suitable abstract concepts that can distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate use, or ordinary and extraordinary use. It's also necessary to create measures that can indicate which constraints are more likely to be breached and which ones are not. Only then can we evaluate whether these measures effectively predict a component's propensity for defects.
