The academic paper discusses the integration of two signal processing techniques—Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)—within the Fractional Fourier Transform (FRFT) domain, as a robust and secure method for image watermarking. The following paraphrases the key points of the paper:

DWT is a valuable tool for analyzing and processing signals, particularly suited for breaking down a 2D image into four distinct sub-bands that capture different components of the image data. By repeatedly applying DWT, one can achieve multi-scale decomposition, extracting various levels of detail. The low-resolution LL band holds the majority of an image’s information and is characterized by its multi-resolution properties, which are compatible with human visual perception. This can enhance watermark imperceptibility.

SVD is utilized for its algebraic feature extraction capabilities in many fields including data reduction, recommendation systems, and natural language processing. It's appreciated for its stability; singular values of an image don't fluctuate significantly under minor disturbances. In digital watermarking, watermarks are frequently embedded into images by altering the singular values within a newly constructed matrix.

The paper aims to offer a novel watermarking method that utilizes the combined strengths of DWT and SVD in the FRFT domain, aiming for enhanced security in watermark embedding. The order of the FRFT transformation can serve as a secret key during watermark embedding and extraction, increasing security.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 explains the basic theories, Section 3 elaborates on the new watermarking method, and Section 4 presents experimental results, analysis, and the advantages of the proposed method compared to other schemes. Section 5 concludes the paper.

Watermark robustness, gauged by the ability to withstand various attacks, is assessed using metrics like Normalized Correlation (NC) and Bit Error Rate (BER). These measure the resemblance between the extracted watermark and the original. Higher NC and lower BER signify closer similarity. Experimental results show the superior performance of the proposed method, particularly against geometric attacks, when compared to other schemes.

In essence, this paper proposes a novel watermarking scheme that combines DWT and SVD within the FRFT domain to improve both the robustness and security of watermarking in digital images.
