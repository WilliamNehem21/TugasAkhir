The paper critically examines existing literature on facility layout problems (FLPs) and maintenance planning in Section 2 and describes the creation of a genetic algorithm (GA) tool to address these issues in Section 3. Section 4 details the experimental outcomes, and Section 5 offers a discussion on the conclusions and suggests directions for future study.

Multiple optimization techniques for resolving FLPs are evaluated, underscoring the effectiveness of GAs in reducing computational time and finding near-optimal layouts. The GA's superiority is affirmed through comparisons with alternative methods and by examining the impact of maintenance on layout reconfiguration costs.

The study of machine breakdown effects within job shop scheduling is common, with various statistical distributions used to model failure rates and machine lifetimes. Corrective maintenance studies complement these analyses.

The GA developed in the paper evolves a set of solutions to minimize total material flow distance, adjusting for dynamic demands and integrating maintenance planning. Experiments using eleven different demand datasets test the GA under various maintenance ratios and corrective maintenance intensity levels. The study reveals that integrating maintenance considerations into layout design can significantly reduce material flow distances and that the differences observed are statistically significant.

These findings underline the importance of incorporating maintenance planning into machine layout designs to enhance efficiency. The robust layouts that consider maintenance reduce material flow distances substantially, indicating potential areas for significant operational improvements.
