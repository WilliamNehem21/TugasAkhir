This academic paper discusses the application of Weighted Finite Automata (WFA) to define real-valued functions, specifically those representing the grayness levels in grayscale images. The paper introduces a process by which a WFA can be created to reproduce a given grayscale image (a function). It presents a novel framework called cooperating distributed weighted finite automata with N-components (N-WFA), exploring its capabilities in different acceptance settings. Furthermore, the paper provides algorithms to both infer (create) and de-infer (reverse-engineer) these N-WFAs.

In detail, Section 2 of the paper covers the basics of WFA and how they apply to digital images. The introduction and examination of the N-WFA construct, its expressiveness in various acceptance scenarios, and its use for representing grayscale images are presented in Section 3, along with the elaboration of the inference and de-inference algorithms for N-WFA. Finally, Section 4 summarizes the conclusions drawn from the research findings.
