To investigate how objects and their interactive interfaces can be studied, the researchers developed a method for assessing how well an object, such as a scheduling policy like "shortest deadline first," aligns with its interactive interface. They used the UPPAAL model checker to confirm that tasks meet their assigned deadlines.

The paper describes a system's structure by defining external interfaces or "facades" that declare ports and potential events for both client and server sides. A combined facade, called "peer," inherits attributes from both and includes additional events for integrated operation.

The authors detail the behavior of the system's components through "constraint automata," which describe event sequences and port actions, distinguished by port names. This behavior has to refine that of inherited components, achieved by merging automata and synchronizing shared actions.

By interweaving different actions and synchronizing common ones, the system allows components to partake in multiple sessions, yet the overall system behavior ensures components are limited to one session at a time. Tools like Vereofy examine the system for issues such as deadlocks, with further analysis available through symbolic model checking tools capable of assessing component interactions.

The authors refine their network model by implementing "channels" with input and output ends, using an automaton to model synchronization between the ends, such as in a 1-place buffer.

Testing specifications derived from component interface models confirm the conformance of CREOL (a concurrent object-oriented programming language) implementations to their behavioral models. These specifications also facilitate component development by simulating environmental interactions.

By translating CREOL models to C implementations, test scenarios ensure that the programming language implementation corresponds with the CREOL model. Real-time aspects of the system, such as scheduling policies, are validated using timed automata.

Each "peer" in the system is modeled with client, server, and datastore objects, fulfilling operations like search, add, and find. Testing is performed both in isolation and in integration with message passing, using CREOL under Maude's rewriting logic, which supports search commands and model checking.

The Maude-based specification execution helps to ensure the correct flow of data across component interfaces. Conformance testing acts as a simulation of the component under test, refined further to ignore errors for cleaner testing outcomes.

To model the entire system, CREOL skeletons of network managers are detailed to construct a full model, executable in Maude. Formal testing links behavioral interfaces, CREOL models, and practical implementations, with dynamic symbolic execution enhancing test coverage by identifying representative and non-redundant test cases.

Event recording in practical implementations allows for trace comparison with models, acting as test oracles to assess test case success. Finally, the paper elaborates on using timed automata and UPPAAL to analyze real-time elements of peer-to-peer systems, ensuring schedulabilityâ€”meaning tasks are completed within deadlines, crucial for the broker object due to its central role and high concurrency challenges. Simulation can help determine worst-case response times to define deadlines for a schedulable system.
