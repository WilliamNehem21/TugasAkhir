The study on nominal sets explores the handling of names, the concept of 'freshness,' and variable binding. This field has been proposed as a way to represent systems with a local memory, offering a simpler approach than the earlier, more complex presheaf models. Despite this, when it comes to expressing the key concept of relational reasoning in systems with local memory, all existing models tend to revert to a sort of presheaf model structure, relying on complex relations that depend on store conditions.

The paper presents a fresh way to apply nominal sets for illustrating relational reasoning with respect to local store. Building upon Pitts and Shinwell's initial ideas, the authors craft a relational model where local store types are depicted as relations. This innovative relational interpretation consolidates the essence of relational reasoning into a single entity for each type, unlike previous methods that employed multiple relations. Furthermore, this model emphasizes that relations are not only a tool for interpretation but also form a solid framework on their own, potentially leading to the development of more refined models.

Specifically, the model is applied to create a relational parametricity principle for the process of local store allocation. This highlights how the relational model strengthens the standard of relational reasoning.

Focusing on the technical aspects, the paper delves into a type of computations that interact with newly allocated cells. Utilizing a nominal set approach and the idea of 'atom abstraction,' the authors model this type to reflect the process of creating a fresh memory cell, initializing it, and binding it to a computation.

For the semantics of this model, the authors employ a CPS (continuation-passing style) methodology to streamline the representation of memory allocation. They work with a nominal set of results to detail the behavior of allocation and interactions with the local store.

The proof of Proposition 4.4 is based on induction over typing rules. Although details are not included, most cases can be understood through the known structures of fine-grainedcbv (call-by-value) computability, and the supportive functions of the monad and Cartesian closed structures. The focus then shifts to operations affecting the local store, with these instances supported by Theorem 5.1.

The authors suggest that through a suitably extended version of Theorem 5.1, relational reasoning involving relations between memory cells can be proven sound. This is hinted to be an avenue for future research and publications.
