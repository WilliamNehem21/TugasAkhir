The paper discusses betweenness centrality, a key metric indicating the importance of a node within a network, according to how many shortest paths pass through it. The authors explore whether a node can improve its centrality by forming a limited number of new connections. While for directed graphs creating new edges cannot be effectively approximated in polynomial time unless P=NP, a simple greedy algorithm offers an approximate solution.

However, the primary focus of this study is undirected graphs. Like directed graphs, it is also proven that the problem lacks a polynomial-time approximation scheme for undirected graphs, unless P=NP. Moreover, it reveals that the greedy algorithm's performance is not bounded in terms of the approximation ratio, which differs from the directed case.

The researchers conducted experiments to compare the effectiveness of this greedy algorithm against another that adds edges to the nodes with the highest betweenness. These experiments demonstrate that the greedy algorithm can achieve ranking improvements by adding only a few edges, making it more efficient than the alternative.

The paper acknowledges that higher betweenness centrality can result in a node receiving more messages or information. This concept is significant in networks where information transfer occurs across the shortest available paths. While other centrality measures like PageRank, eccentricity, and closeness have been studied previously, this paper's contribution lies in its focus on the difficult problem of increasing betweenness centrality.

After defining the problem and setting forth the relevant notation, the paper provides a proof of the problem's complexity. It then details two algorithms, proving that they may perform poorly in terms of the approximation ratio. The experimental section presents data on the efficiency of the greedy algorithm. Finally, the paper concludes with a summary and suggestions for future research, after demonstrating through examples how the greedy algorithm operates to increase a node's betweenness centrality.

In summary, the paper reports that increasing a node's betweenness centrality in undirected networks through the addition of a limited number of new edges is a complex problem lacking an efficient approximation algorithm, and that a greedy approach, while not having a bounded performance, can be more effective than simply adding connections to nodes with high initial betweenness.
