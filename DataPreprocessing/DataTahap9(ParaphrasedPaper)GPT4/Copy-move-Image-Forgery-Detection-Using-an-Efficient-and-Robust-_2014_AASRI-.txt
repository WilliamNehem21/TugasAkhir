In today's digital era, images and videos are essential for sharing information, but the ease with which they can be manipulated using widely available editing software raises serious concerns about their authenticity and integrity. Copy-move forgery, wherein segments of an image are duplicated and pasted within the same image, is a common method of tampering. To address this, we propose a robust method for detecting copy-move forgeries that can withstand various image processing manipulations. The method employs a combination of Dyadic Wavelet Transform (DYWT) and Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) techniques.

The process begins by applying DYWT to the image to break it down into four sub-images: LL, LH, HL, and HH. The LL component, which retains most image information, is the focus of further analysis. We apply SIFT to the LL part to identify key features and create descriptor vectors. These vectors are then compared to detect similarities that could indicate copy-move tampering. Our approach, integrating DYWT with SIFT, allows for the identification of a greater number of matching keypoints, thus enhancing the effectiveness of copy-move forgery detection.

The paper is structured as follows: The subsequent section reviews prior work on image forgery detection. Section 3 thoroughly details our proposed method, while Section 4 presents the simulation results and discusses the evaluation of performance parameters. The paper concludes with a summary and list of references.

Looking to the future, the paper suggests additional research directions, building upon the groundwork laid by Mahalakshmi et al., who looked into basic image manipulation detection, and Anand et al., who designed an algorithm for digital image copy-move forgery detection that resists sustained attacks by using SIFT and DYWT methods.

This research introduces an innovative technique of copy-move forgery detection that relies on transforming the image using wavelet domain analysis and then applying SIFT to identify features. Unlike traditional DWT, the employed DYWT is shift invariant and does not involve downsampling, making it more suitable for detecting tampering while maintaining image quality. The efficacy of DYWT and SIFT in identifying tampered images is confirmed, highlighting the SIFT features' optimal solution due to their high computational efficiency and robust performance.
