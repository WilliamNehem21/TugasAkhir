This academic paper discusses the application and formalization of refinements in Coloured Petri Nets (CPNs). The document is structured as follows: Section 3 deals with deduction systems and their practical applications. Section 4 presents a case study that explores various formalizations through experimental validation. Conclusions and directions for future research are summarized in Section 5.

The paper begins by introducing the Petri Net formalisms employed and specifically the version of Petri Nets under consideration. It outlines the different approaches to refining Petri Nets, offering a concise overview of type refinement and a more detailed discussion on subnet and node refinements. While full details of the type refinement are reserved for later discussions, the paper provides enough information to comprehend the subsequent Section 5.

The refinements discussed are based on previously defined methods for CPNs. The paper adapts the concept of refinement to suit place/transition Petri Nets, and the authors articulate their intention to expand their approach to include colors later on in Section 4.5.

Petri Nets are visualized as bipartite graphs with a limited arc structure characterized by the direction and weight of connections (W), where no arc is present if W is zero.

The paper reviews three types of refinements, promising a mathematical treatment of subnet refinement in Section 4. This specific refinement extends an original abstract net by incorporating a subnet connected via input arcs to the abstract net, constraining transition firing and ensuring behavior preservation.

The paper details using Coq, a formal proof management system, to specify and verify the proposed refinement approach. It demonstrates the application of Coq's Lemma 2.7 in the formalization of subnet refinement proofs, highlighting the independence of lemma properties from diverse representational forms used within these formal demonstrations.

Arcs are differentiated by their direction and weight (the count of tokens for simple Petri Nets) and are labeled accordingly. The concept of a marking is addressed, which indicates the quantity of tokens at a place.

A tactic language, LTAC, aids in refining subnet proofs by pattern-matching goals and applying suitable strategies to achieve those goals.

The authors aim to use PNML (Petri Net Markup Language), an emerging standard for Petri Nets, to translate files directly into Coq, facilitating the handling of places, transitions, and arcs within the proof assistant.

The paper's objective is to establish a method for Petri Net refinement that is accessible to users who are not experts in formal proof assistants. It acknowledges that while this area has been widely explored for other specification languages, there is still a lack of formalized work regarding CPNs and the associated proof of refinements.
