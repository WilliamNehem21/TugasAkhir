Adler, Konheim, and McAndrew introduced the concept of topological entropy, which has since emerged as one of several invariants useful in distinguishing topologically conjugate dynamical systems. Following its introduction, topological entropy has become a valuable metric for the classification of such systems. Later on, the concept was reformulated by Dinaburg and Bowen to apply to metric spaces, and it was discovered that the two interpretations of topological entropy align when the topology under consideration is derived from the space's metric.

Thanks to the Perron-Frobenius theorems pertaining to nonnegative matrices, it is possible to compute the topological entropy for a broad class of shift spaces. Given this, the question has been raised regarding whether the calculation of topological entropy can be carried out effectively. Researchers have made several attempts to compute the entropy of general dynamical systems, which have laid the mathematical groundwork essential for its computation. Section 6 of the paper addresses this topic, delving into the matter of calculating topological entropy efficiently. Following this, Section 7 considers a particular category of shifts that allows for a straightforward method of determining entropy. The final section, Section 8, is reserved for further discussion on the topic.

In the case where you have irreducible square matrices labeled A1 through As, forming block rows where each row contains at least one matrix with a block column that is smaller than the respective block row and is not a zero matrix, a unique normal form can be established. The uniqueness of this normal form is subject to permutations of the blocks and permutations of indices within each diagonal block.

Given an irreducible square matrix of size n by n, there exists n! different permutation matrices. The process for creating the normal form, as described, implies the existence of an algorithm that can determine the normal form when provided the matrix A as input. The validity of this algorithm is supported by Proposition 5.1, leading to the declaration of a corresponding theorem.
