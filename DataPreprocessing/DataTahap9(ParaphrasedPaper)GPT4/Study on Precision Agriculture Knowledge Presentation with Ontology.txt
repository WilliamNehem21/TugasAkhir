Agriculture is a sophisticated area of scientific study composed of numerous concepts and interconnections. Identifying key knowledge within the complex system of agricultural science is essential. Effective concept modeling is necessary to enhance support for distributed information retrieval, analogical inference, and knowledge-based data mining. Ontology, a foundational knowledge theory, offers a solution for representing knowledge within this domain.

Attributes of agricultural ontology (AO) serve to define and constrain agricultural concepts, drawing on various sources of information. For instance, crops are considered a subset of plants and thus inherit characteristics such as genetic makeup, physical form, and species distribution. Additionally, crops possess unique characteristics related to their growth environments, including climate and other cultivation conditions. These characteristics are organized into different property classes, each of which includes multiple individual properties, collectively forming a comprehensive descriptor for crops.

To facilitate management of this ontology and represent the hierarchical relationships between properties, these elements are designed as part of the crop property ontology system.

Once the agricultural ontology and knowledge base are established, an important proceeding step is to verify and reason with this knowledge. The development of a consistent set of axioms is proposed to support this process, leveraging the established ontology to enable coherent and accurate analysis.
