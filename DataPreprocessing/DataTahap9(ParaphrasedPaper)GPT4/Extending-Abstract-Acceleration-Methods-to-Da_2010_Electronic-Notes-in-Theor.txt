The paper discusses the challenge of constructing a control graph for systems that only have numerical variables and addresses the issue of non-determinism caused by numerical input variables. The authors expand upon the method of abstract acceleration, initially proposed by Gonnord and others, to accommodate systems with numerical inputs. This extension is not straightforward, as it necessitates careful consideration of how loops involving translations, resets, and inputs are accelerated, specifically when the loop guard distinctly limits state and input variables. Without this condition, replicating any affine transformation without inputs is possible.

The paper is structured to build upon this central contribution. After introductory remarks, the program model of interest is describedâ€”particularly its application to synchronous data-flow programming and its conversion to a purely numerical variable control graph. The discussion encompasses convex polyhedra, which are used as the abstract domain for maintaining invariants over numerical variables, along with associated operations like intersection and the convex hull.

The authors' main contribution is explored in detail, demonstrating how to extend abstract acceleration to account for inputs by modifying methods from earlier sections. However, they acknowledge shortcomings such as the inability to utilize certain beneficial observations when inputs are present.

Looking ahead, the authors acknowledge the unresolved task of identifying an optimal control graph for logico-numerical programs that lack explicit control flow. The goal is to find a balance between precise reachability analysis and the avoidance of combinatorial explosions by maintaining a level of symbolic representation for boolean variables. They propose a heuristic approach to identify states akin to timed or linear hybrid automata to which abstract acceleration can be effectively applied. The paper concludes with these considerations, leaving the detailed exploration of the control graph identification to future research.
