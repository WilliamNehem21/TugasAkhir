Image classification, a vital tool in biometric applications like face recognition, depends heavily on effective image representation. Accurate image representation is fundamental for robust classification outcomes, as it enables clear differentiation between subjects in an image. In representation-based classification, a sample is represented by a linear combination of training samples, and its dissimilarity is assessed for classification against the nearest class. Significant in face recognition, representation-based classification algorithms like sparse representation (SR) and collaborative representation (CR) have been widely researched and developed.

The paper outlines a novel fusion method to enhance CR, analyzes reverse integration on classifiers, and determines optimal factors for classifier integration through experimentation. The paper's structure presents related work on SR and CR, describes the proposed absolute distances in collaborative representation-based classification (ABSCRC) method, analyzes fusion factors, and includes experimental validations on benchmark datasets, ending with a conclusion.

Various improvements have been made in SR, such as fast L1-minimization algorithms and version-specific enhancements for robust face recognition. CR has also been optimized by integrating transfer learning, multiple classifiers, and reinterpretation through probabilistic theories. Yet, it has room for improvement, particularly in refining collaborative coefficients for test samples.

The proposed ABSCRC method demonstrated improved classification accuracy over conventional CR by integrating absolute distance vectors with CR residuals, verified through extensive experiments. Although challenges remain, optimal fusion factors discovered through experimentation suggest that ABSCRC performs better than CR in most cases.

The research examined visual datasets, including Caltech Faces and Leaves, ORL, FERET, CMU Faces, and the Senthil IRTT Face Database, revealing that integrating absolute distances into CR improves classification robustness. The paper concludes that ABSCRC, accommodating a tuned factor b for weighting, delivers superior performance compared to existing CRC methods.
