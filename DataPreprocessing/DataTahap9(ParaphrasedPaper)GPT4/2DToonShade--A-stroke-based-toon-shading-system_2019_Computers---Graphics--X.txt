Our concept stems from the realization that while advanced automatic shading techniques typically involve a complex process, effective manual shading can often be quite straightforward. A typical conventional method, such as creating a 3D model from 2D artwork, rendering with 3D illumination, and then simplifying the shadows to fit the hand-drawn aesthetic, can be unnecessarily intricate. Our system circumvents the predominant complex workflows by using algorithms that operate solely in 2D, thus maintaining the intuitive nature of traditional hand-drawn animation and still achieving attractive, credible shading effects.

In our approach, we designate a group of potential shading candidates (C) that are likely to match a specific shade (S) we want to carry over from one frame (n) to the next (n+1). Around each shade, there's a region (A) and a corresponding region in the subsequent frame (A+1). We aim to find at least one starting point in A+1 for the shade to continue.

Traditionally, the quality of cartoon-like shading is highly dependent on the geometric precision of the 3D models or normal maps. A key benefit of our system is that it permits artists to freely decide where to add shading; they can also individually adjust each shade and select shading colors for aesthetic appeal rather than physical accuracy.

We introduce 2DtoonShade, a comprehensive framework for semi-automatically generating shading and shadows in cartoons. This departs from previous efforts that sought to derive 3D models or normal maps from 2D drawings, as our tool aims to create shading lines that complement the animation style within a 2D workspace. Our system produces believable cartoon-like shading and shadows and minimizes the manual effort traditionally required in drawing them. It introduces unprecedented flexibility by allowing changes to lighting after the fact. Additionally, our tool introduces an innovative method for positioning lights in 3D space without leaving the 2D realm, which has been met with approval from seasoned artists. Our comparison with established methods and commercial animation software leads us to believe that our work can inspire future research into non-physical approaches to manage shading and shadows.
