This academic paper discusses the integration of blockchain technology within the Internet of Things (IoT) environment, exploring various methods of combining these technologies for use in diverse applications. It classifies the integration techniques based on literature and considers blockchain's role, data exchange processes, and the focus on blockchain for service provision within the integrated system. The paper provides background on blockchain, IoT, and health information technology (HIT), followed by an analysis of current challenges, existing systems, recent developments, and potential improvements in healthcare and IoT applications.

The review identifies gaps in the literature, especially concerning access control, data integrity in blockchain systems, and the combination of blockchain with IoT. It sheds light on data security priorities related to data integrity, access control, and privacy preservation, presenting a classification of the strategies adopted for these security aspects. The paper examines the diverse network topologies and consensus mechanisms that support blockchain and describes how smart contracts function in blockchain systems.

It emphasizes the constraints of IoT devices, such as their limited capabilities and security vulnerabilities, and explores the difficulties in establishing interoperability among diverse IoT systems. Blockchain's potential in enhancing IoT security and managing health data is discussed, with particular attention paid to the benefits, challenges, and application domains.

The paper reviews methodologies for integrating blockchain with IoT, including various architectural approaches that determine the amount of data exchanged through blockchain and the balance between blockchain and cloud services. It also looks at data management in blockchain systems, touching on acquiring, processing, disseminating, retrieving, and storing data. Additionally, the review considers the use of blockchain in smart cities and the pharmaceutical supply chain.

Finally, the paper analyzes how blockchain can enhance data management within healthcare, improving patient control over their data and ensuring better data integrity, availability, access control, and privacy preservation. It points out that blockchain also aids in data acquisition through sophisticated authentication methods and has the potential to revitalize the use of smart contracts for data processing. However, it notes that data dissemination and retrieval are less focused in blockchain research, and developers face challenges in data storage due to various constraints, which they try to overcome with innovative solutions.
