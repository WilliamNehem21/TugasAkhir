The structure of the academic paper is outlined as follows: Section 2 initiates the discussion by presenting the concept of a dagger kernel category. In Section 3, the authors discuss key examples that illustrate the main ideas. Sections 4 and 5 delve into the mechanisms of factorization and the emergence of (co)images. The paper culminates in Section 6, where it introduces the Sasaki hook along with the 'and-then' logical connectives, exploring their roles within adjunctions and examining the conditions for a Boolean algebraic structure.

The paper closes by addressing an unresolved issue regarding whether the constructions outlined for Boolean algebras can also be adapted to orthomodular lattices. The authors note a complicating factor: the straightforward extension to orthomodular lattices is not feasible. The obstacle arises because, for the formation of kernels, the 'and-then' connective is essential; however, this connective lacks both associativity and commutativity unless applied within the confines of a Boolean lattice, as highlighted in Proposition 6.1.
