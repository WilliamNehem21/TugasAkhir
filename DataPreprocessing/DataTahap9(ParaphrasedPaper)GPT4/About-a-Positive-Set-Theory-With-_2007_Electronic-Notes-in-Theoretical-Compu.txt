The academic paper clarifies a misconception about the origins of a particular theory. It points out that the theory, often incorrectly credited to E. Weydert, was actually proposed first by R. Hinnion. Despite this confusion, Weydert has made significant contributions in the field through his doctoral thesis. Moreover, the same conceptual framework that influenced the development of the Strong-Frege-3 theory has been observed in Hinnion's own work as well as in the research of others such as Brady, Gilmore, and Skolem. However, the paper identifies that dedicated discussions on Strong-Frege-3 itself are primarily found in two specific papers.

The document goes on to discuss the potential of Strong-Frege-3 in facilitating various set-theoretic constructions, while also pointing out that the consistency of Strong-Frege-3 remains unresolved. Although proving the theory's consistency is an open problem, partial progress can be made by providing models for its fragments, which the paper intends to explore in subsequent sections.

Lastly, the paper references a historic result by Friedberg from 1958, which demonstrated that recursively enumerable (r.e.) sets can be arranged in an injective sequence. Building on this, the paper sets out to establish a similar result specifically for the subclass V01, which comprises r.e. sets representing partial recursive functions with binary outputs, following the standard encoding scheme for pairs of integers.
