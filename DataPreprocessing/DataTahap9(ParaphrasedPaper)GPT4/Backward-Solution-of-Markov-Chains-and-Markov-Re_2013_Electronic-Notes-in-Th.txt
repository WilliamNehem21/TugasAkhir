The state space S is divided into two types of states: a set of temporary states ST, and M distinct groupings of persistent states S_Ri (referred to as recurrent classes). The matrix T represents the sub-stochastic DTMC (Discrete-Time Markov Chain) for the temporary states ST. There are also rectangular matrices F_i, each indicating the transition probabilities from ST to the i-th set of persistent states. Lastly, each R_i is a square matrix that functions as the DTMC for the i-th group of persistent states.
