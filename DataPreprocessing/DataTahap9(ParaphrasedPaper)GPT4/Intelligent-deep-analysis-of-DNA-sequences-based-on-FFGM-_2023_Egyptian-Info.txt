This academic paper describes an approach to analyzing the structure of DNA using graph theory. The DNA is represented as a graph wherein the four nucleotide bases—adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G)—constitute vertices that are linked across the two strands of the DNA double helix in a specific pattern, with A always pairing with T, and C with G. Each nucleotide is connected within its own strand by a backbone composed of phosphate, sugar, and the base itself. 

The initial algorithm works with a single strand of DNA, which is extracted from the double helix. This strand is then processed to form messenger RNA (mRNA) by substituting every thymine (T) with uracil (U), while leaving cytosine (C) and guanine (G) unchanged, resulting in a preliminary mRNA structure. 

Following mRNA synthesis, the mRNA strand (now represented as a graph) is divided into several subgraphs. These subgraphs are then input into the RDFSM algorithm, which seeks various subgraph patterns that meet a specified minimum support threshold. An example is provided in the paper to illustrate the process.
