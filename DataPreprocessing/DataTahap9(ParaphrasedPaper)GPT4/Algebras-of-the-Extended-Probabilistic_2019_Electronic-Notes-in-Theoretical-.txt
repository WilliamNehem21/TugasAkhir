This academic paper explores the structures called algebras associated with specific types of monads in the context of T0 topological spaces, which are spaces where no two distinct points have exactly the same set of open neighborhoods. The paper focuses on the algebras related to two particular monads: the simple valuation monad (VF) and the point-continuous valuation monad (VP).

In the category of T0 topological spaces, algebras for these monads are fully described. For the VF monad, its algebras are identified as weakly locally convex topological cones, while for the VP monad, its algebras are weakly locally convex sober topological cones. In both cases, the morphisms (structure-preserving maps) between algebras are characterized as continuous linear maps.

The document also discusses the algebras of the extended probabilistic powerdomain, which is another structure related to the category of T0 spaces. It revisits some established information about the extended probabilistic powerdomain monad and discusses properties of cones, a mathematical concept integral to the discussion. The paper establishes that every algebra of this monad in the T0 setting is a weakly locally convex sober topological cone and the morphisms must be continuous linear maps between them.

The authors describe how these algebras are intimately linked to the concept of barycentres, drawing inspiration from work by earlier researchers like Choquet and Cohen.

However, the paper points out a limitation in the general setting: the valuation space corresponding to a topological space X does not always form a monad on the category of T0 spaces. Specifically, the topology often lacks the necessary richness to provide the intended monad structure. To circumvent this, an alternate weak topology on the valuation space is proposed, which does allow for a monad structure.

The paper recounts foundational elements of monad algebras, reminding the reader that the pair comprising an algebra and the monad's multiplication is itself an algebra of the monad. For any topological space X, the valuation space with weak topology is then identified as an algebra for the monad under discussion.

An example within the paper illustrates that for any topological space X, the space of real-valued, non-negative functions on X can be seen as a cone with the usual operations of pointwise addition and pointwise scalar multiplication. It forms different types of cones depending on the topology of X, and it relates to the concept of semitopological and topological cones.

Moreover, the paper discusses Heckmann's work on continuous valuations and how simple valuations and point-continuous valuations are subsets of these, and indicates that these subsets can be extended to monads on the category of T0 spaces. Hence, the paper contributes to the study of structures in topology and their relations to monads, which are foundational in the area of theoretical computer science and mathematical logic.
