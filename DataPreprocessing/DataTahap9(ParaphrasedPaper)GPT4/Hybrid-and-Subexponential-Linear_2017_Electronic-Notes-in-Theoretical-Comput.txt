The paper discusses the encoding of Hybrid Linear Logic (HyLL) into Subexponential Linear Logic (SELL), which includes quantification over locations, to provide deeper insights into the meaning of worlds in HyLL. It also concludes that previous attempts to encode Computational Tree Logic (CTL) operators into HyLL are limited, as a complete set of temporal connectives cannot be represented without a Linear Logic (LL) system with fixed points.

The difference between HyLL and SELL primarily lies in how modalities are handled in each logic. The paper proposes a new way to represent HyLL formulas in SELL, showing that a flat subexponential structure in SELL is enough to represent any world structure found in HyLL, thus indicating that world structures do not increase the expressive power of LL since they can’t manage logical context in the same way subexponentials can through the promotion rule.

Furthermore, the paper details how formulas and logical connectives interact with one another through the concepts of monopoles and bipoles, and the paper explains the structuring of focused proofs, which alternate between negative and positive phases based on the nature of the formulas involved.

The paper shows how encoding HyLL's rules into SELL doesn’t require a hierarchical subexponential structure because in HyLL, worlds do not govern the application context like the promotion rule does in SELL. This suggests that HyLL doesn’t enhance the expressive power of LL.

When encoding CTL within LL, the fixed-point logic is necessary to represent the behavior of temporal operators, suggesting that existing theorems are inadequate for such encoding and that the transition rules must be internalized in the quantifier definitions of CTL to properly manage rule application.

Finally, the paper notes the implementation of formal proofs in HyLL within the Coq proof assistant and expresses interest in extending these implementations to SELL to facilitate both formal system examinations within SELL and formal meta-theoretic studies of SELL itself.
