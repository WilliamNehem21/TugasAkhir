The academic paper discusses the advantages of using rational trigonometric interpolating splines with tension parameters, also known as shape parameters, for interpolating data. These splines are versatile because they can represent data as both straight lines and curves, and their tension parameters do not impact the continuity of the spline. The rational design of the splines also ensures that they can manage singularities effectively.

The paper notes that data collected from physical or experimental sources typically exhibit one or more shape characteristics such as positivity, monotonicity, or convexity. Examples of sources that produce positive data include rainfall measurements, gas discharge rates, and values obtained from exponential functions. Similarly, the motion paths of robot arms are non-negative, demonstrating these shape characteristics.

Moreover, the paper highlights the convex hull property of these splines, meaning that the curve will remain within the convex hull formed by the control points.

The proof provided in the paper states that for a set of positive data points arranged in an increasing order, a curve generated by interpolating this data is C1 continuous if the knots are uniform, while it is C0 continuous otherwise. However, previous research indicated that the order of continuity is influenced by factors such as the multiplicity of knots and shape parameters, or the selection of derivatives. This approach does not apply well to irregular data and cases where preserving derivatives is critical. In contrast, the rational quadratic trigonometric spline proposed by the paper maintains its order of continuity regardless of the spacing of the knots, the slope of the secant line, or the shape parameters, making it more universally applicable.
