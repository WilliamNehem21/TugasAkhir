The academic paper discusses the concept of allocentric relations, which are object-to-object relations that play a crucial role in forming representations of environments in memory. Imperfections in encoding these relationships can lead to inaccuracies in one's cognitive mapâ€”a mental representation of spatial environments. 

While some research suggests that cognitive maps enable individuals to navigate through familiar environments and to find their way in new areas, other studies argue that cognitive maps aren't entirely cohesive. Instead, they may be composed of separate elements, such as landmarks, route segments, and regions.

The majority of research on cognitive maps focuses on adult spatial navigation, examining how people connect different routes, form cognitive maps, and vary in their ability to do so. However, there is a gap in the research when it comes to the development of cognitive maps at the fetal stage. Intriguingly, fetuses display the ability to perform tasks like moving their hands to suck their thumbs or grasping their umbilical cords, which implies some form of spatial understanding and the potential early formation of cognitive maps.

The paper also touches on the role of proprioception (the body's ability to sense its position and movement) and perceptual learning in the development of cognitive maps. Research has explored how proprioception can affect the time it takes to use spatial representations and how other factors, including visuospatial abilities, can impact the accuracy of spatial representations.

Sensory inputs, such as tactile pressure, are collected and processed, leading to the generation of proprioceptions from sensory length and perceptions from sensory pressure. These sensations are integrated in what the paper refers to as the "mechanoreceptors-association-map," where associations between co-occurring perceptions are formed. Combining proprioceptions and perceptions associated with various sensory neurons, the cognitive map captures the various positions and helps facilitate navigation and spatial awareness.
