This academic paper aims to create an approximate model of substance transport and availability within blood vessels using a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) with varying concentration levels. CTMC with levels utilizes discrete levels to represent the concentration of various species within the model.

The authors propose this methodology to gain access to additional analysis tools such as robustness testing against different levels of randomness. They demonstrate that partial differential equations (PDEs) can be approximated using this method, enabling the use of Bio-PEPA—a modelling language based on CTMC with levels—and associated analytical tools for examining blood vessel scenarios.

A critical aspect of the work is the development of a method to represent diffusion in one-dimensional cylindrical coordinates as a CTMC with levels. The key innovations presented in the paper include:

1. The arrangement of the paper is as follows: Section 2 covers converting PDEs to CTMC with levels. Section 3 presents an illustrative example. Section 4 discusses works related to the research, and Section 5 concludes and highlights future research directions.

2. The derivations apply to a model in one-dimensional cylindrical coordinates focusing on the radial dimension. They clarify that despite considering only the radius, this represents concentrations across the entire circumference at a given radial distance from the center. The height of the cylinder is disregarded as it remains constant in their model, allowing them to use the terms "area" and "volume" interchangeably.

3. The paper demonstrates that it is possible to convert ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with compartments, derived from PDEs using cylindrical coordinates, into CTMCs with levels. This conversion relies on finding a corresponding relationship between the diffusion coefficients in the PDEs and the kinetic constants in the mass-action transport reactions of the ODEs.

4. For the CTMC state space to remain finite, the model defines a maximum concentration for each species, divided into discrete levels. Each level indicates a specific molar concentration, ensuring a manageable number of states within the Markov chain.

5. The paper relates the methodology used for converting ODEs to CTMC with levels to previous foundational works and further solidifies the theoretical connection between them. It also integrates the concept of transportation between different compartments of the model.

Overall, this paper presents a significant contribution to the field by detailing a novel approach to approximating complex blood vessel systems with CTMCs, facilitating advanced analysis using existing computational tools.
