The future of the power industry is heading towards distributed generation, with wind energy being the most extensively adopted form of sustainable, renewable energy. When distributed wind turbines are integrated into the electric grid as localized energy sources, they notably influence the distribution of power flow, voltage stability, and the amount of energy lost during transmission.
