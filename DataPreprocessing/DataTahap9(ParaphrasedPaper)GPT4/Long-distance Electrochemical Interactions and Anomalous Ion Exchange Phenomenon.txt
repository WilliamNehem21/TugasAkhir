Electrochemical reactions commonly take place without compromising the electric neutrality of the overall system or its large-scale components. Variations from neutrality are typically limited by the Debye length, indicating that known chemical processes do not produce significant electric charges or currents across macroscopic distances.

Research on hydrogels, which are polymer networks that swell dramatically when exposed to water, has been extensive due to their sensitive response to minor changes in external conditions such as temperature, ion concentration, and electric currents.

The interactions between different hydrogels have not been studied as rigorously as individual hydrogels, with only a few studies addressing this topic, focusing on direct contact interactions. However, we present new observations of long-distance electrochemical interactions between hydrogel samples.

It's noteworthy that the swelling behavior of one hydrogel type, PAA gel, is not straightforward and depends on its distance from another hydrogel. Surprisingly, the gel can achieve higher levels of swelling than it typically does in pure water, where it's usually highest, despite the presence of added salt or organic compounds that would normally cause it to shrink.

In this context, an applied electric field has two effects. It influences the charged particles near the gel's surface to cause further swelling, and it also can lead to the breakdown of certain chemical groups within the gel, balancing the electric charge across the two samples and limiting the extent of reaction that involves ions.

A unique ion exchange reaction occurs between the hydrogel pair, with low-molecular-weight ions being distributed between them and low-molecular-weight salts being incorporated into the hydrogels from the solutionâ€”effectively an abnormal form of ion exchange. This reaction is seen as a combination of processes occurring in separate samples and is better understood within the context of long-distance hydrogel interactions.

This phenomenon has practical applications similar to ion exchange methods, such as water purification. The long-distance interactions in hydrogels offer advantages, such as being easily regenerated by applying mechanical pressure to expel the accumulated salts, and allowing for the selective removal of various salts from a solution.

In conclusion, the interaction between acidic and protonated polymer hydrogels is an example of a chemical process that leads to the creation of a significant electric charge, which might function as a chemical signal capable of traveling long distances. This could potentially be applied in developing artificial neural networks in the future. Additionally, the observed phenomena have potential uses in specialized ion exchange processes for the thorough removal of low-molecular salts from water solutions.
