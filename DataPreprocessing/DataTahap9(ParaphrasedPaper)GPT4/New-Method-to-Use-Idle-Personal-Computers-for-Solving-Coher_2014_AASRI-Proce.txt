In this academic paper, the authors present a novel method for addressing coherent task processing challenges in distributed computing systems that utilize the computational resources of individual personal computers (PCs). These resources are subject to dynamic changes due to their users' actions, which complicates their integration into cohesive distributed computational efforts. The unpredictable variability of PC performance and the heterogeneous nature of the PCs within a distributed system exacerbate the difficulty of efficiently assigning and completing tasks.

The authors propose the use of a multiagent system, where each PC in the distributed computing network is managed by a proactive software agent. These agents coordinate in a decentralized fashion to delegate tasks, thereby forming a community to handle each incoming coherent task. The approach foregoes the need for centralized servers and emphasizes decentralized collaboration among the agents.

An advantage of the proposed methodology is the adaptability of the computing process to the current capabilities of the available personal computers within the distributed system. The paper introduces two algorithms designed to address coherent tasks in environments where PC parameters are not constant.

To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method and associated algorithms, the authors conducted various experiments focusing on the performance metrics of actual PC load and the percentage of tasks completed on time. These experiments were designed to not only demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithms but also to assess the trade-off between processor time utilized for the main computational tasks and time spent on organization and task distribution.

The experimental results indicated that the actual load on PCs was favorable, with utilization between 72% and 92%. This reflects an organizational overhead of only 8% to 28%, suggesting the proposed method is efficient when compared to an average effectiveness rate of 40% reported in similar studies.

The paper emphasizes the importance of further research to explore the full potential of this approach and aims to present empirical evidence of the algorithms' efficiency. Additionally, it seeks to understand the processor time loss due to coordination within the distributed system. The experiments were strategically designed, taking into account multiple parameters categorized into three groups: primary (system-wide parameters), secondary (specific to tasks and PCs), and tertiary (user-dependent conditions). The results suggest that the proposed approach can significantly improve the efficiency of solving coherent tasks within a distributed PC-based computing system.
