The field of computer science is shifting its perspective of computer systems from standalone applications to networks of interactive, autonomous entities. Recent advancements have focused on developing languages and frameworks that facilitate communication among these software agents. However, currently, there is no comprehensive formal mathematical theory that underlies languages and protocols for agent interactions.

In this paper, we present a pioneering mathematical theory that captures the essence of agent interactions. We use category theory to create a robust formalism that models the dialogue utterances and the resultant commitments in agent interactions, and provides a structure for mapping between them.

Historically, the construction of agent interaction protocols was influenced by philosophical dialogue games, some dating back to Aristotle, and later revitalized by Charles Hamblin. Analogous to economic game theory and model theory games, various types of dialogues have been considered, like information-seeking, persuasion, and negotiation.

Van Eijk, referencing programming language semantics, identifies three core semantics for agent communication — axiomatic semantics defines locutions based on pre- and post-conditions, which are represented through the agents’ beliefs, desires, and intentions.

Many efforts to define semantics for agent protocols are specialized, focusing on single or specific classes of protocols, rather than establishing a universal theory. We propose to offer such a universal mathematical theory that can evaluate and compare different agent interaction protocols.

We conceptualize protocols in a general sense, not tied to specific interaction types or outcomes, and articulate our framework in several sections, demonstrating its ability to generically represent interaction protocols.

More broadly, our theory distinguishes itself from work related to general computational process interaction, such as game semantics, by focusing specifically on goal-oriented agent interactions and their outcomes.

We also touch upon the concept of commitments within agent interactions, noting the various ways they have been interpreted in the literature, and propose to define them in terms of actions external to the dialogue.

Lastly, our paper addresses category theory basics, including categories, morphisms, and monoids, and relates these to the semantics of commitments and dialogues, laying the groundwork for a mathematics-based model for agent interaction protocols. We conclude with an example of how this model can be applied to auction protocols and a discussion on future research avenues.
