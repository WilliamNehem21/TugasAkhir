The paper discusses a method known as Logic Meta Programming (LMP) for extracting design information from software programs. This approach uses logic programming to pose questions about a program, relying on a set of logic rules that describe the relationships between various elements of the program under certain conditions. By querying these relationships, developers can gain insights into the program's structure and functionality.

The authors are particularly interested in identifying design patterns through the use of patterns that detect certain behaviors. These patterns are currently defined using an ad hoc model based on execution traces. They believe that research in abstract interpretation, which provides a theoretical foundation for analyzing program behavior, could improve this approach. The paper is an invitation to the abstract interpretation community to discuss and provide feedback on this idea.

The paper provides an overview of the LMP approach, details a specific design pattern, compares structural-based pattern detection with the proposed behavior-based method, and explores how abstract interpretation might be applied to this domain.

LMP involves using a Prolog-like language to reason about object-oriented software. Its usefulness extends to various object-oriented software engineering problems, such as examining design, ensuring adherence to programming patterns, facilitating software evolution, and confirming architecture model conformity. The authors use the SOUL logic meta programming system with Smalltalk programs to perform their experiments, emphasizing that the SOUL system's applicability spans class-based object-oriented languages generally, as demonstrated by its adaptation to Java.

The paper also describes how logic queries are used in LMP to, for example, verify if there is a hierarchy relationship between two classes or to discover all the subclasses of a given class. These queries use the predicate `isInHierarchyOf:` to prove such relationships.

In addition to the LMP technique, the authors are investigating approximate reasoning to provide a more lenient and pragmatic approach for detecting software patterns, particularly useful when there are minor inconsistencies between the required pattern facts and the actual program facts. Future research may focus on integrating approximate reasoning with program semantics to enhance the flexibility and effectiveness of pattern detection. 

This summary aims to capture the essence of the paper without delving into the technical specifics and jargon, in order to make the content accessible to a wider audience.
