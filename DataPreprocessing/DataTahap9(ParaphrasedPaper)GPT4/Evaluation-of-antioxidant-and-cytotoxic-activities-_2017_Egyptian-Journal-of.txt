The study in question focused on evaluating the traditional uses of Haplophyllum tuberculatum, a plant employed in Omani folk medicine for various ailments, and testing its biological effects. Extracts made from the plant's leaves were tested for their antioxidant and cytotoxic properties using DPPH (a chemical compound used to measure antioxidant activity) and Brine Shrimp Lethality assays.

In preparation for testing, the plant's leaves were dehydrated, powdered, and extracted with methanol through Soxhlet extraction. The resulting methanol extract was then separated into fractions of increasing polarity: hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, butanol, and water extracts. These different extracts were then evaluated for their ability to scavenge DPPH free radicals and their lethal effects on brine shrimp larvae, to understand their potential antioxidant and cytotoxic activities.

The outcomes demonstrated that among all fractions, the ethyl acetate extract exhibited the highest antioxidant activity, while methanol showed the lowest. In a descending order of antioxidant strength, the extracts were ranked: ethyl acetate > butanol > water > chloroform > hexane > methanol. For cytotoxicity, the chloroform extract was found to be the most potent against brine shrimp larvae followed by ethyl acetate and hexane extracts. The butanol extract showed the lowest lethal concentration required to kill 50% of the brine shrimp (IC50), indicating higher cytotoxic activity.

This study was the first to report on such activities for Omani H. tuberculatum, supporting the traditional use of the plant. Specifically, the ethyl acetate extract showed potential to be used as a natural antioxidant. Further investigation is recommended to understand the therapeutic potential of these extracts for preventing chronic diseases.

Given the medical significance of H. tuberculatum, it's noted that there is now commercial cultivation worldwide. A variety of reagents and equipment were employed in the study, sourced from several international companies, to carry out the investigation. The study emphasizes the need for further comprehensive in vitro and in vivo assessments for the active extracts and underscores the importance of understanding the bioactive compounds responsible for the plant's biological effects.
