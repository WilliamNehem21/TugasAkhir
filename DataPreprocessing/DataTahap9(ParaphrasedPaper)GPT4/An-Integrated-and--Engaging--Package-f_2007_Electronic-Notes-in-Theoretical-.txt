The academic paper discusses an innovative feature in an animation system where necessary guidance, called adaptive documentation, is integrated directly into the animation interface. This feature ensures that users don't have to toggle between the animation and separate instructional content, as the documentation overlays at the top of the animation display. However, this functionality is not yet implemented for B-trees but is available for all other supported tree structures and encompasses both insertion and deletion procedures across four distinct depth levels.

The paper highlights the novelty of the system prototype, recognizing it as one of the initial systems to employ real-time values within its onboard guidance and to offer various granularities of instructional content. Another groundbreaking aspect is the system's capability to append code to an ongoing visualization without necessitating a reset and reprocessing from the start, marking this as a first for the Animal system.
