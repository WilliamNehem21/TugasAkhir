The paper discusses solving the reachability question for an autonomous system, which doesn't rely on external inputs. This is accomplished by incorporating the input function, typically denoted by bu, into the state space of the system, effectively converting it into a system without input. However, this results in an increased dimensionality of the system, with the increase equal to the number of input variables.

It is mentioned that when the system matrix 'A' is non-invertible, traditional methods generally require preliminary transformations to achieve an invertible system matrix before proceeding. The novel method proposed in this paper, in contrast, does not necessitate this step. Moreover, upon a detailed examination, the computational complexity of the traditional and the newly proposed methods is found to be comparably similar.
