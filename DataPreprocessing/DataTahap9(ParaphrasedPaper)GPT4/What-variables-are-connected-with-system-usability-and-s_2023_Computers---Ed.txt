This academic paper focuses on examining the usability of educational virtual reality (VR) technologies and how it impacts learning and user satisfaction among university students. The study used a mixed-methods research approach to collect data from 64 students learning about construction engineering via an interactive VR field trip.

The main findings were:

1. Usability and satisfaction were rated positively, indicating that VR is accepted as an appropriate instructional method.
2. Ease of use, usefulness, presence, and extraneous cognitive load significantly predict system usability.
3. Usefulness, presence, and intrinsic cognitive load significantly explain satisfaction within the VR educational context.

The study contributes to the understanding of educational VR acceptance, showing the interrelation between usability factors and satisfaction, suggesting recommendations for designing effective VR learning experiences. Additionally, the study's results reinforce technology acceptance theories like the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), which predict technology adoption, highlighting performance expectancy and effort expectancy alongside specific variables relevant to VR, such as presence and cognitive load. The research also advocates for mixed methods in studying technology acceptance to integrate both quantitative and qualitative insights, helping to bridge existing gaps in literature and practice.

Limitations include the use of brief surveys instead of extensive measures for certain variables, potentially missing nuanced insights. The study's implications for educational design emphasize the need to focus on ease of use, usefulness, presence, extraneous load (to enhance system usability), and intrinsic load (to improve satisfaction), while also considering the effect of extraneous cognitive load on related usability variables. The paper suggests that incorporating VR-specific variables into technology acceptance models can better predict behavioral intentions and usage behavior in VR learning environments.
