The article examines the composition of biopolymer blends, analysing their characteristics using various methods. FTIR spectroscopy assigned distinct absorption bands to the individual biopolymers and their mixtures, indicating their unique chemical structures. XRD patterns showed both wide and sharp peaks, corresponding to the amorphous characteristic of PMMA and the semi-crystalline attribute of PCL, respectively.

UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy showed that as the proportion of PCL in the blend increased, the onset of absorption edge shift to longer wavelengths, and the optical energy gap dropped from 5.047 to 4.265 electron volts, indicating that the two biopolymers are miscible.

Thermal stability investigation using TGA demonstrated that PMMA experienced greater weight loss when compared to PCL, suggesting that the presence of PCL augments the blend's thermal resistance.

Overall, the study suggests that a biopolymer blend ratio of 80% PCL to 20% PMMA optimizes certain electrical, structural, and optical properties, which could enhance the blend's suitability for biological applications.
