This academic paper examines the development of a novel High-Order Optimal Disturbance Observer (HOODO) for precise estimation of aerodynamic torque and consequently, wind speed in wind energy conversion systems (WECSs). Additionally, the paper explores the use of a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) for effective speed tracking in the generator of the WECS.

The effectiveness of the proposed optimal composite control strategy, which combines HOODO with LQR, is validated through MATLAB/Simulink computer simulations. Key contributions of the study include:

1. The newly proposed HOODO is capable of estimating rapid changes in disturbances such as aerodynamic torque with greater precision than previous models, which often assumed that disturbances changed slowly.

2. An optimal algorithm helps to select the gains of the HOODO effectively, addressing the common challenge of gain tuning in observation systems. This is accomplished by adjusting the diagonal elements of specific weight matrices to achieve desired performance.

3. The paper compares and provides detailed analysis and investigation of four different orders (first through fourth) of the HOODO.

4. A practical and straightforward gain tuning rule for the LQR is introduced, facilitating its implementation in actual hardware systems.

5. The stability of the closed-loop HOODO-based LQR system is thoroughly examined using the Lyapunov approach, ensuring a clear understanding of the system's response.

The study also notes how modifying weight matrices Q and R impacts the control action (denoted as Ku). Increasing Q enhances reference tracking but requires more control effort, while increasing R results in smaller control values, potentially degrading tracking performance. The appropriate balance between control efficiency and energy consumption must be considered when adjusting Q and R.

Errors in estimating aerodynamic torque varied with the choice of R, with maximum estimation errors for four chosen values of R (1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively) displayed, as well as corresponding wind speed estimation errors.

Overall, the HOODO-based LQR demonstrates superior accuracy and responsiveness than previous control schemes, including the Hâˆž-based LQR method. The newly designed controller exhibits less sensitivity to parameter changes, which confirms its effectiveness and potential advantages over other high-order observers. Future work might involve creating an experimental setup to validate the proposed methods in real-world scenarios.
