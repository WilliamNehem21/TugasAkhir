In this academic paper, the authors introduce Hybrid Duration Calculus (HDC), an extension of Restricted Duration Calculus (RDC) with additional hybrid logical features. These extra features include nominals (labels for specific intervals), satisfaction operators, a down-arrow binder (a reference to the current interval in a formula), and the global modality (access to arbitrary intervals). RDC itself is a decidable fragment of Duration Calculus (DC), an interval logic that allows for reasoning about the accumulated time states occur within intervals in real-time systems.

Despite the known undecidability of even simple subsets of DC formulas, RDC has been proven decidable. The paper aims to preserve this decidability while increasing expressiveness. The authors show that HDC retains decidability through a reduction of the satisfiability problem to the satisfiability problem of the monadic second-order theory of order, for both discrete and continuous time domains.

While standard RDC is limited as it lacks constructs for representing interval relations (neighborhood modalities) that expand beyond a given interval, HDC overcomes this limitation by incorporating such modalities. HDC's discrete-time semantics ensure that intervals are defined with natural number endpoints, and the overall framework demonstrates a higher expressive power than RDC.

The authors address the complexity of the satisfiability problem for RDC and by extension HDC, noting that it is non-elementary for both continuous and discrete-time interpretations. As such, they argue that a more efficient decision procedure for HDC is unlikely, given the complexity inherent to these systems.

To summarize, the paper presents HDC as a powerful tool for reasoning about real-time systems with a confirmed decidable property, achieved by enriching RDC with hybrid logical elements and demonstrating the expanded capability through translation methods to a decidable second-order theory.
