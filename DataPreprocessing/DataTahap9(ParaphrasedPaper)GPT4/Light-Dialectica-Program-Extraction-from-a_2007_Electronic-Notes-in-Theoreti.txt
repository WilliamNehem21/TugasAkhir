Recent advancements in the area of deriving programs from classical proofs have led to significant mathematical achievements, specifically in examining classical analytical proofs. However, when using computer-implemented algorithms for program extraction, the outcomes remain confined to simpler examples, and the resulting programs are often not the most efficient versions.

Minlog is a system designed for interactive proof development and program extraction, created by H. Schwichtenberg along with the Logic Group at the University of Munich. It is built upon a first-order natural deduction calculus and employs minimal logic as its foundational principle, instead of classical or intuitionistic logic. More comprehensive information about Minlog can be found in the referenced literature.
