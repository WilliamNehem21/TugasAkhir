This article presents a novel method for accurately determining the optimal size of fine grinding mediums. Comparative tests between cast iron segments and steel balls were conducted, with the results indicating that mill capacity and grinding efficiency were significantly higher with cast iron segments. The application of this optimized grinding medium also led to noticeable improvements in grinding and flotation processes during industrial experiments.

The size of steel balls in fine grinding is crucial: too large, and they can over-crush the ore due to excessive crushing force; too small, and they may not grind the ore finely enough due to insufficient impact. Selecting the correct fine grinding medium is aimed at achieving the right balance of crushing force to enhance grinding efficiency. Many concentrators face the issue of oversized fine grinding mediums, which is becoming increasingly serious.

Following industrial testing, outcomes showed a 2.29 percent increase in the yield of P2O5 concentrate and a 2.39 percent enhancement in its recovery. These improvements are largely attributed to the optimized size composition of the grinding product and the increased degree of mineral liberation that results from using the finely-tuned grinding medium. The adoption of selective grinding, a new process, has further enhanced both the grinding and flotation stages.

While steel balls have traditionally been used as a fine grinding medium, they are not necessarily the most effective. Steel balls present a limited grinding surface area and high impact force. The cast iron segment, however, provides a larger grinding area and favorable shaping for turning, which leads to a superior grinding effect. Fine grinding relies primarily on abrasion, supplemented by minor impacting. Therefore, grinding mediums crafted from wear-resistant, low-cost cast iron materials could help overcome certain shortcomings.
