In academic research, it is posited that writing to memory may alter how it is perceived, although typically it does not lead to changes, and when it does, it's usually only a subsection of the address space that is affected. Understanding the distinction between modified and unmodified segments enables efficient deduction following such memory modifications.

In the pursuit of this research, a basic model is used. This comprises a straightforward conceptual representation of a machine, and it disregards memory permissions, except to note whether a virtual address is mapped or not. While permissions represent additional attributes of virtual addresses, they can be readily incorporated into the theoretical framework. Other works have integrated real machine codes with the underlying logical framework, and the researchers believe their logic can be connected similarly.

Virtual memory is a hardware-generated abstraction that provides each process with its own memory perspective, with physical memory regions dynamically assignable within this view. This introduces another layer where virtual addresses might correspond to physical addresses. Access to memory typically occurs through virtual addresses, but hardware devices might alter physical memory directly. Such actions can be approximated by aligning virtual addresses one-to-one with physical addresses.

The introduction of virtual memory into separation logic invites questions about the definition of "separation" for two predicates and about the division of state space to express their independence. The goal is to make assertive statements on three levels—virtual-to-physical, physical-to-values, and virtual-to-values—while retaining the separation utility in assertions and adhering closely to conventional separation logic symbols.

The paper discusses the established notations followed by the exploration of the virtual memory concept and the authors' specific model. The logical framework is presented, its properties are scrutinized, related literature is reviewed, and the findings are summarized.

In a simplified machine model presented, where 32-bit pointers reference 32-bit memory words, the address space accounts for 2^32 words. Contrary to common 8-bit implementations, this model comprises virtual pointers (vptr), physical pointers (pptr), and values (val). The memory views described earlier are defined within this context.

The paper presents two key rules. The first asserts that properties not influenced by the modified heap area remain valid post-update. The second, a weakest-precondition rule, facilitates backward deduction, indicating that if a property 'p' applies to a heap where 'p' is set to 'v', then 'p' will hold true following the update.

Post-operation, the address space remains intact except for the specific alterations made to the virtual pointers that correspond to the changed physical address. Modifications to the heap are only discernible through a single virtual address, because virtual pointers cannot overlap under separation conjunction, as described in earlier sections.

Separation logic has proven useful for verifying code involving context switches, and other research has expanded its application for C programs with pointer manipulations. The current study employs a simplified machine model devoid of Hoare logic, but the framework appears supportive of these augmentations.

The research presents an evolved separation logic capable of addressing the complexities of virtual memory and its processes. The proposed system of logic provides a streamlined method to represent memory predicates at different levels—via virtual mappings, physical heaps, and virtual address spaces—whilst maintaining classical separation logic's semblance. It upholds separation logic's pure and intuitionistic characteristics, albeit without exposing the finer points of its abstraction. This work is supported by formal proof in the Isabelle/HOL theorem prover.
