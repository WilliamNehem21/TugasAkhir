The paper discusses how Linda-style coordination models—which are known for their simplicity and elegance—do not include the concept of time, thus making them less effective for modeling real-life coordination involving temporal aspects. While Linda lacks time constructs, industrial systems such as TSpaces and JavaSpaces, which were inspired by Linda, have integrated time-related features.

The paper's aim is to systematically explore the addition of relative time into coordination models, building on previous work to examine the expressiveness of Linda, enhanced with a delay mechanism, and Linda primitives that support the duration of tuples and the suspension of communication operations.

Gelernter and Carriero have highlighted the importance of distinguishing between the interactional (communication-related) and computational (processing-related) aspects of software components through the Linda model. Linda can supplement any programming language with a set of communication primitives, which manage the creation of processes and operations on data within a shared dataspace.

The paper mentions the classical two-phase functioning approach used in real-time systems, as seen in languages like Lustre, Esterel, and Statecharts. In the first phase, elementary actions or statements are executed instantaneously, and the same assumption is made for composition operators. Time progresses by one unit only in the second phase when either all actions are completed, or all components meet a specific timed action.

The paper focuses on two particular enhancements to Linda that were previously introduced: the delay mechanism and support for tuple duration and communication suspension. New results are presented, furthering the understanding of these enhancements.

The authors discuss the family of languages L(X), parameterized by the set of Linda-like primitives X (including primitive operations out, in, rd, and a primitive for testing absence). Agents are defined to interface intuitively with these extensions by rewriting agent expressions to meet expected behaviors and by applying bimonoid structure simplifications.

Proofs are provided for the outlined properties and the different scenarios involving delay and token durations. They explain how computations are affected by these timing constructs.

The paper also relates its study to other research that has introduced time into coordination-related languages, including concurrent constraint languages and proposals for managing timed data in coordination systems. Time is represented either through quiescent computation points, reinitialization of tuple space, or fixed execution times for operations.

In summary, the paper deeply investigates how the introduction of relative time to Linda-based coordination languages affects their expressiveness and ability to model real-world coordination scenarios. It compares its findings with previous extensions and other related works, offering new insights into this field of distributed computing.
