Regarding the intricacy of our proposed method, our aim is to develop an algorithm that efficiently reuses data from earlier stages and dynamically narrows the choice of test functions. Nonetheless, providing a preemptive demonstration of efficiency, such as a proof of polynomial run time, appears to be beyond our grasp with the understanding we currently possess.
