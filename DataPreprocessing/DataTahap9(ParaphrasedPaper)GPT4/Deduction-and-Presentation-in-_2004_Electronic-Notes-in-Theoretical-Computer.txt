We present the capabilities of a rule-based system for deductive reasoning and proof presentation developed in Mathematica. This system can generate internal representations of deduction derivations known as proof objects based on user-defined specifications. Additionally, the system can display these deductions in a format that is easily readable by humans, with the ability to adjust the level of detail. The natural-language style used to present proofs is adapted and simplified from the styles used in Theorema to meet our specific requirements.

The choice of Mathematica as the platform is due to its exceptional support for both symbolic and numerical calculations. Furthermore, we believe rule-based programming can be effectively utilized to create proof engines, solvers, and simplifiers that can be incorporated into Theorema. As Theorema is built in Mathematica, a robust rule-based system developed within the same environment could serve as a valuable tool for those working on Theorema.

To manage the selection during the proof process, our system includes a feature called 'prohibit'. When provided with a list of symbols like {f1,..., fn}, the system refrains from selecting any subexpressions whose outermost symbol matches any in the provided list. By default, 'prohibit' is set to an empty list, which means that all subexpressions are eligible for consideration during rewriting.

The option 'maxdepth' is introduced to prevent endless processing that can result from boundless branches in the search for a derivation. This option is preset to 10,000, limiting the derivation search depth accordingly. When the 'tracestyle' option is set to anything other than "none," 'maxdepth' also caps the depth of the partial derivation tree documented in the proof object being generated.
