The use of punctuation helps readers identify the difference between a question and a statement. Similarly, a skilled technical writer can choose the right visual cues, as offered by an annotation system, to clarify general and specific content plans. CTML, which can be viewed as a system for directing communication, relies on the visual arrangement of text to enhance and regulate discourse. This method is supported by cognitive research that seeks to understand how we comprehend, process, and present information.

The paper describes four terms related to text analysis:

1. Describe: Originating from the Latin 'describo,' this term relates to augmenting an initial sentence with additional related information. This is symbolized by a spiral which begins at the core sentence and widens out, incorporating complementary details from various sources to assist with understanding.

2. Explain: This term comes from the Latin 'explano,' meaning to unfold or disclose. It involves providing facts and reasoning to clarify an event within a sentence. This can be started by outlining a cause and presenting its effects or vice versa, depending on what would make the explanation clearer.

3. Regress: Derived from the Latin 'regredior,' meaning to return, this term is used when more context is necessary to deeply understand the topic within a sentence. It signifies a narrowing of focus and detailed exploration of a specific topic, prompted by the reader's need for further information.

4. Express: Coming from the Latin 'exprimo,' which means to expel, this term refers to the inclusion of personal views and emotions regarding the facts and events within a sentence. This represents the most subjective form of content delivery, which is intrinsically tied to personal assessments, judgments, and emotional reactions.
