The academic paper mentions that within standard lattice theory, an element that is considered both prime and compact is often referred to as "completely coprime." However, in the references [3, 14, 13] cited by the paper, elements with these properties are labeled as "prime." Following the terminology used in these references, the paper also adopts the term "prime" to describe such elements. Additionally, the paper references a result that is taken from sources [3, 14].
