Modern medical diagnosis relies heavily on biomedical and clinical data. Machine learning algorithms have proven effective in analyzing this data, aiding physicians in making decisions. Consequently, machine learning-based approaches have been developed with varying levels of effectiveness and computational demands. There has been a particular focus on non-communicable diseases due to their prevalence and potentially life-threatening risk factors. Diagnosing diabetes or breast cancer can be approached as a binary classification problem. This paper introduces a novel machine learning algorithm called Geometrical Driven Diagnosis (GDD), which can diagnose diabetes and breast cancer with accuracies of up to 99.96% and 95.8%, respectively.

Type 2 diabetes is the most prevalent form of the condition, affecting an estimated 415 million people globally, with approximately 193 million cases remaining undiagnosed. Early detection and proper treatment of diabetes can significantly reduce the severe health impacts associated with the disease.

The experiments conducted demonstrate the superiority of the proposed GDD algorithm over other recent algorithms in the field. Section 5 of the paper concludes the proposed approach and details the experiments performed. Section 6 discusses the limitations of the current study and outlines possibilities for future research.

In the process, the data for the positive class (diabetes or breast cancer diagnoses) is duplicated one or more times to balance the dataset against the negative class (non-diagnoses). Subsequently, each subset is split into a training set, which receives 70% of the data, and a testing set, which receives the remaining 30%. The training datasets are then clustered using various techniques as part of the proposed algorithm.
