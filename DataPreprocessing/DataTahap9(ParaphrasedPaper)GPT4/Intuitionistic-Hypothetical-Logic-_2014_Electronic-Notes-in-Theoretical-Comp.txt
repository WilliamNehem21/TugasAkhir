**Paraphrased Remark 2.2:**
One might question if it's possible to omit the "plus" operation within the implicative section, yet still represent every theorem of S4 logic. Such a scenario is indeed possible if we include what's called "non-injective specification sets" and "nonnormal realizations" as described in LP terminology (refer to section 11.2 in [5] for more details).

**Paraphrased Abstract of Academic Paper:**
In a certain foundational framework known as basic intuitionistic logic of proofs, the concept of a modality represented as [u]]A, where 'u' is a proof variable, is defined. A set of axioms for this modality is presented, alongside basic Intuitionistic Propositional Calculus (IPC) and Modus Ponens (MP), showing that these are sufficient to represent intuitionist tautologies. The system is later expanded with additional operations on proof terms and is demonstrated to be fully complete with respect to arithmetic.

Exploring the proof theory for this enhanced system could be an engaging research direction. Additionally, natural deduction for partial versions of first-order logic of proofs presents another research avenue. Although first-order logic of proofs does not permit finite axiomatization (references [23, 8]â€”but see other sources), moving away from the framework of Peano arithmetic, the derived type theory could provide a basis for a logical framework that supports decidable forms of reflection. Work is underway to extend these findings to the full logic of proofs based in classical logic.
