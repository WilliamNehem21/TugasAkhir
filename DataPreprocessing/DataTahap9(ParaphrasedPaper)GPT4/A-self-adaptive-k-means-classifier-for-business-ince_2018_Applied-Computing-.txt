This paper explores the intersection of customer preferences, fashion design, and business success. Mok et al. introduced an interactive genetic algorithm (IGA) to allow customers to easily create customized fashion designs. However, the authors recognize that time-constrained customers tend to delegate the design process to designers in today's fast-paced world where e-payments are commonplace.

The authors draw on set-theoretic qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) to identify consistent patterns in fashion design preferences. This paper also highlights the need for fashion companies to strike a balance between artistic expression and economic viability, as pointed out by Jacobs et al. It examines the key attributes contributing to business success for designers, such as style, fabric, and color combinations, which are crucial for projecting creativity in fashion design and positioning designers as creative entrepreneurs.

The paper is structured into sections, starting with a literature review of data mining in the fashion industry, followed by market incentives for designers using k-means clustering. Implementation and results are presented next, along with a discussion and finally a conclusion with suggestions for future research.

In the realm of data analysis, new data mining techniques like the balanced low-rank classifier (LRC) and the global linear regression coefficient (GLRC) classifier are proposed, showing an evolution from past methodologies. The paper also defines industrial design and its role in optimizing product function and appearance, while detailing how fashion design entails a blend of sketching, imagination, and logistic skills.

Customers often create novel designs by combining elements from different existing pieces, which designers view as new designs due to these alterations. The paper discusses clustering methodology, noting that data points are assigned based on their proximity to the mean vector of each cluster.

Despite limited data affecting the precision of the study's results, the paper ends by suggesting future research should investigate additional factors that could further enhance the fashion industry's development.
