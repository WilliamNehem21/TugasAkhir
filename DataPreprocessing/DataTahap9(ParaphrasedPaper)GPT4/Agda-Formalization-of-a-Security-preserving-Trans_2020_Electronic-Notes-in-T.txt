The paper discusses information flow analysis as an essential method to maintain data confidentiality. It highlights confidentiality policies, especially non-interference, which prevent private data deduction from public data by maintaining the secrecy of computation outcomes even when the inputs change. Non-interference is implemented through information flow type systems that check programs statically, ensuring compliance with security policies without the need for runtime verification.

The paper contrasts flow-insensitive with flow-sensitive security type systems. The former maintains constant security levels for variables throughout the program, while the latter allows variable security levels to change during execution. Flow-sensitive systems are more flexible as they admit a broader range of secure programs.

The paper is organized into sections, beginning with a high-level language and a flow-insensitive type system, followed by a flow-sensitive type system based on Hunt and Sands' work, and concluding with a program transformation and proof.

Using a security model in which each variable has an assigned security level, the authors propose flow-insensitive type systems that handle variables with unchanging security levels (fixed-type variables) throughout execution. This is contrasted with floating-type variables in flow-sensitive models, where security levels can vary.

Explicit flows occur when data is copied from higher to lower confidentiality variables, like from a confidential variable xh to a public variable yl. The paper emphasizes the importance of tracking the security level of the program counter to assess the security context of instructions.

The flow-sensitive type system defined by Hunt and Sands for the "while" language is presented. It utilizes a lattice of security types L to check source programs.

The paper introduces a theorem that relies on the properties of a semilattice of environments, focusing on the finite nature and length of strictly ascending chains, with a function called bound that assigns a natural number to each element in a strictly decreasing order.

The paper also discusses implementing flow-sensitive type systems using Agda, creating typed terms for expressions and statements that later translate to flow-insensitive typed terms. Expressions in the flow-sensitive system are immediately implemented with the internalist approach, using a type environment and the security type of an expression represented within a type exps.

Program variables in the code are enumerated to correspond with positions in a type environment, represented as a vector vec s n, where n is the number of unique variables.
