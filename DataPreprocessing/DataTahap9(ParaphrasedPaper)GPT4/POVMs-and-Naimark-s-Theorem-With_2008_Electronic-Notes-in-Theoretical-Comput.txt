The academic paper in question acknowledges the financial support provided by the EPSRC Advanced Research Fellowship EP/D072786/1 and the EPSRC grant EP/C500032/1. The author expresses gratitude towards Dan Browne, Peter Selinger, and Reinhard Werner for their constructive feedback on an earlier version of the work presented.

Remark 2.1 points out that the definition of completely positive maps, as used in the paper, is purely multiplicative and based solely on the tensor structure, reflecting the Kraus representation. In this representation, the usual summation in completely positive maps is implicitly captured by the internal trace and cotrace structure within the framework (denoted by CPM(C)), visualized by half-circle diagrams.

Remark 4.9 introduces the concept of Positive Operator-Valued Measures (POVMs) and how they typically disregard the state after a measurement. However, the analysis in the paper does suggest a potential candidate for non-destructive measurements, also known in the literature as PMVMs (possibly a typo, more commonly referred to as PVMs or Projective Valued Measures). A more thorough discussion on this is planned for future publications.

Remark 4.10 acknowledges the intricate implications of X-completeness and normalization in POVMs. Due to spatial constraints in the paper, the discussion on this aspect is limited and is scheduled to be expanded in a future, more detailed version of the work.
