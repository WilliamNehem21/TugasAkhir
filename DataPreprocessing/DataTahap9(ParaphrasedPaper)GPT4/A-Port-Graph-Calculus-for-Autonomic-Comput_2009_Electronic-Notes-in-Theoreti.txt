Our prior research has demonstrated that port graphs, structures akin to multigraphs with specific connection points, and a rewriting calculus are effective tools for representing protein interactions. Subsequently, port graphs were suggested as a modeling framework for dispersed resources and grid computing, with each resource depicted as a node accompanied by ports. The inherent challenges of lacking global knowledge, coupled with the independent, distributed nature of system components, are portrayed using collections of port graphs and local, concurrent, and nondeterministic rewrite rules. Certain computations unfold spontaneously and in parallel, while others are intentionally directed using strategic controls.

This approach not only facilitates a formal analysis of computational processes but also provides a means to validate essential characteristics of systems. We demonstrate the capability to express and guarantee the ongoing satisfaction of a system's structural attributes through the utilization of strategic controls in the computation. This research contributes to the formal definition and validation of adaptive systems and furthers the theoretical base of self-managing computing.

The structure of the paper is as follows: The second section introduces port graphs, rewrite rules for port graphs, and the rewriting process for port graphs, exemplified by molecular graph transformation in a biological setup. The third section introduces an abstract rewriting calculus, inspired by biochemical reactions in which molecules are seen as structured objects, rules, and broader abstractions. Interactions between abstractions and molecules are considered computational steps. By including mechanisms for application and failure, we can define broader abstractions called strategies to enforce control over rule application within the same framework. In the fourth section, we extend this framework to validate the structural attributes of systems, demonstrating how such properties can be articulated as strategies and satisfied at each computational stage, ensuring system invariances. The final section proposes future research directions.

Port graphs are identified by nodes with designated connection sites called ports, with edges attaching to nodesâ€™ specific ports. This concept resembles the way proteins, characterized by various functional domains that dictate potential binding interactions, form complexes in biochemical networks. Graphically, the state of a domain is shown by a filled circle to indicate binding, an empty one for availability, and a crossed one for obscurity. 

The paper also presents a modeling technique for molecular complexes, restricts the connectivity of these ports, uses port graph rewriting rules to represent molecular interactions, and explores the inclusion of association and dissociation functions to bridge chemical and biochemical representations. 

Our primary contributions within this paper are the introduction of an abstract biochemical calculus for modeling rule- and strategy-driven system evolution and integrating syntax extensions for system property verification, inspired by biological systems. This work is aimed at bolstering our comprehension of autonomic computing from a theoretical perspective.
