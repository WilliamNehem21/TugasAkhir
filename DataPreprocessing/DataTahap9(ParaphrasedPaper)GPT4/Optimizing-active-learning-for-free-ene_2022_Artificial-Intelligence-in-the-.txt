The paper describes computational methods applied to the discovery of inhibitors for the SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease (PLpro). It highlights the significant computational expense required for these calculations, suggesting that parallel computations on multiple GPUs could still be cost-prohibitive. The paper details the steps taken to narrow down an initial large library of commercially available molecules to a final list of promising candidates.

The procedure involved:

1. Selecting a set of 8175 docked structures from the initial library.
2. Using the Thermodynamic Integration (TI) method in Amber 18 for Relative Binding Free Energy (RBFE) calculations on a subset of 45 molecules.
3. Docking these compounds using Schrodinger software and refining the list based on certain criteria, resulting in 39,527 filtered hits.
4. Applying two stages – conversion and decoupling – to estimate the free energy of dehydrating the target ligand without assessing the reference compound.

When using active learning (AL) methods to prioritize which molecules to sample in a campaign, the study found that even with reduction to 6% of the dataset, it was possible to maintain a high recall of the top molecules, with various algorithms recovering a significant portion of the top-performing molecules.

Different acquisition functions were tested, including greedy (an exploitation strategy) and half-sampling (an exploration strategy), and their effects on performance and diversity were measured. The results indicated that simple random initialization coupled with a greedy acquisition function performed well, with the number of molecules selected at each iteration being a significant factor affecting performance.

Specific computational techniques, such as Random Forest regression, Gradient Boosting Method (GBM), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), and Half Sampling (HS), were discussed, mentioning their respective advantages. The authors also examined strategies like the Probability of Improvement (PI) and Expected Improvement (EI) policies for AL.

In considering the practical application of these methods, the paper underlines the importance of time and cost for drug discovery projects. It asserts that computational results must be generated quickly to be impactful in the drug discovery process.

Finally, the study emphasizes that while the results are promising, they could be specific to the data and design used, encouraging others to perform similar comparisons and share their datasets.
