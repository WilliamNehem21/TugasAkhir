In this section, we discuss certain characteristics related to quantities of various hierarchical classifications of numbers. It's worth noting that several findings and techniques mentioned here could be alternatively described using binary trees that meet specific criteria. Evidently, any classification of size n is analogous to a binary tree with n terminal nodes. For more sophisticated approaches to enumerating these classifications, references to works by Moczurad, Tyszkiewicz, and Zaionc are suggested. Additional information can also be found in publications by Kostrzycka and Zaionc.
