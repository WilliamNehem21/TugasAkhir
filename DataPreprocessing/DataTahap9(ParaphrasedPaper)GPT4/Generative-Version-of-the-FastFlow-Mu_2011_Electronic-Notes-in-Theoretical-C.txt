FastFlow, a highly promising multicore C++ framework, is limited by a design flaw related to type safety and communication between threads. The flaw arises due to the usage of pure virtual functions within a base class that can't be templated due to virtuality, compelling threads to use `void*` pointers for argument passing, which is not type-safe. This paper proposes enhancements to FastFlow that not only bolster type safety by utilizing templates and static polymorphism instead of dynamic, but also improve performance by eliminating virtual methods and the consequent overhead.

Furthermore, this work explores the impact of memory fences on performance and presents solutions for communication patterns in parallel applications that bypass memory fences, thus aiding in scaling and speed. FastFlow architecture is designed as a stack of layers for simplified development of fast, scalable, streaming applications through non-blocking, lock-free, and fence-free synchronizations.

The principal method for thread communication in the base class `ff_node` is the svc function, which this paper transforms into a type-safe templated method, eliminating the need for virtuality through the Curiously Recurring Template Pattern (CRTP), thereby avoiding runtime errors due to improper type casting.

In addition to design principles, this paper describes the implementation details of the FastFlow framework, including a custom memory allocator optimized for specific multithreading patterns, and outlines how memory management influences overall performance.

Finally, the paper reiterates the improved approach with examples, demonstrating the transition from using void pointers and virtual functions to a template-based strategy that is type-safe and efficient. The new solution incorporates template arguments to specify data types and uses static polymorphism, which remains compliant with FastFlow's existing multicore features while simultaneously correcting the identified design concern.
