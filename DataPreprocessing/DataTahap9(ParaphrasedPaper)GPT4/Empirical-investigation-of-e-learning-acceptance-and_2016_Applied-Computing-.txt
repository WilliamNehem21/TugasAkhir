The academic paper discusses the increasing importance of technology-assisted learning, or e-learning, in both the academic sphere and corporate training due to its numerous benefits such as wide geographical reach, learner flexibility, cost efficiency, and convenience. E-learning is being recognized as one of the most impactful developments within information and communication technologies (ICTs).

In response to these advancements, Saudi Arabia has initiated a national strategy to adopt e-learning across the country. This includes the establishment of the National Centre of E-learning & Distance Learning by the Saudi Ministry of Higher Education. The Centre focuses on managing the transition to e-learning, preparing materials, and helping universities rapidly transform to adopt e-learning platforms.

Recognizing the importance of understanding user acceptance and adoption of e-learning, the study pulls from foundational works by Venkatesh and Bala, and Baker et al., who dealt with the acceptance and adoption of IT, to develop a customized technology acceptance model (TAM3).

The research aims to empirically investigate e-learning acceptance and integration in Saudi Arabiaâ€”a cultural context different from where the original TAM was developed. The study uses TAM3 to predict e-learning technology acceptance in Saudi Arabia and explores post-implementation interventions that could aid in the successful adoption and assimilation of e-learning systems in developing countries generally.

The research objectives include:

(i) Customizing TAM3 to identify factors influencing e-learning acceptance and assimilation.
(ii) Conducting surveys to test the adapted e-learning model.
(iii) Presenting findings such as key factors for e-learning acceptance, and managerial interventions to improve e-learning management.

The study anticipates contributing a framework for understanding the critical success factors and interventions for e-learning systems in developing nations.

Furthermore, Mirza and Al-Abdulkareem's review of e-learning in the Middle East is mentioned. They discuss driving factors and challenges, different forms of e-learning initiatives, and the steps towards overcoming these challenges, with a specific case study of Saudi Arabia.

The paper highlights the crucial role of post-implementation interventions, which consist of various organizational, managerial, and support activities aiming to improve user acceptance after the launch of a system. Such interventions are essential in helping users adapt to changes and see the new system as an opportunity to improve their work. TAM3 recommends potential interventions like training, organizational support, and peer support.

Lastly, the paper references a study by Chin, Marcolin, and Newsted on measuring interaction effects using partial least squares latent variables modeling, which was presented at an international conference.
