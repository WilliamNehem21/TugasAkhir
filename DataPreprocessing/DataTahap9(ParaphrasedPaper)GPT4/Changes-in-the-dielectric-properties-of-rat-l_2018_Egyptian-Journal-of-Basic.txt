The paper discusses the effects of ionizing radiation, specifically 2 Gy and 10 cGy doses, on the fluidity of cellular membranes. The study used dielectric spectroscopy and FTIR (Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy) to assess these effects, revealing that the higher 2 Gy dose notably increased membrane fluidity compared to the 10 cGy dose. This alteration in the membrane was characterized by a shift and broadening of the CH2 asymmetric stretching vibration observed in the FTIR spectra. The findings underscore the significant damage even low-dose radiation can inflict on cellular membranes, presenting a risk at the cellular level. Additionally, dielectric spectroscopy aided in analyzing these changes by investigating the permittivity parameters in rat lung tissues subjected to irradiation.
