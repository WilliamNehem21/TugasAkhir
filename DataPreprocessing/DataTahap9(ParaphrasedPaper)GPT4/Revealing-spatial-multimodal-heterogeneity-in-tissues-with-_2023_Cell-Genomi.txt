The paper introduces SpaTrio, a computational method designed to integrate single-cell multi-omics data with spatial tissue data. This innovative tool addresses the challenge of losing spatial information during tissue dissociation by aligning and mapping single cells to their original locations within the tissue, allowing researchers to study gene regulation, cellular communication, and the multifaceted tissue environment.

SpaTrio operates by taking single-cell multi-omics and spatial transcriptomics (ST) data, using optimal transport algorithms and knn-based graph constructions to probabilistically align single cells with spatial spots within tissues. Based on gene expression and spatial proximity, it reconstitutes multi-omics spatial patterns, deconvolves spots, and enables extensive downstream analysis, such as studying spatial gene regulation and inferring multi-omics cell-cell communication networks.

An important feature of SpaTrio is the ability to adjust the weighting between transcriptional similarity and spatial distance in the alignment process using a hyperparameter. It can also identify spatial co-expression patterns of molecules and smooth molecular expression across cells using a spatial kernel to facilitate spatial module recognition and analysis.

SpaTrio has proven superior performance compared to other tools, demonstrated through simulation, the mapping of cell types, and the preservation of biomolecular gradients in tissue regions. It was applied to real datasets, accurately identifying cellular and molecular patterns and interactions in mouse cerebral cortex, liver, and human breast cancer tissues.

The paper details robustness to noise, including pseudocount adjustments, integrative analyses for cellular communication using different modalities like protein interaction scores, and spot mapping techniques that respect the underlying tissue structure.

Overall, SpaTrio offers a compelling solution for reconstructing the spatial landscape of cells in complex tissues and can support deeper exploration of cellular dynamics and interactions with spatial context and multi-omics data.
