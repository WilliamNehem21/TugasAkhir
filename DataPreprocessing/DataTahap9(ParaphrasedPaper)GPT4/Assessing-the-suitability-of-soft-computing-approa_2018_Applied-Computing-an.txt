In recent years, numerous studies have demonstrated the significant role of soft computing (SC) techniques in the monitoring, discovery, prediction, and relationship analysis of forest fires, as well as in estimating burned areas under future climate conditions. Many papers have focused on applying SC techniques for forest fire prediction.

A widely applied type of feedforward network is the Multi-layer Perceptron Neural Network (MPNN) which is favored for its simplicity, speed, ease of implementation, and ability to tackle complex classification problems. An MPNN consists of three primary layers: input, hidden, and output. The function of the hidden layer is to transmit data to the output layer. Neuron outputs can be calculated using a transformation function like a threshold, sigmoid, or hyperbolic tangent. The weights between nodes are crucial in this process.

Support Vector Machines (SVM) are powerful for solving both classification and regression issues by creating n-dimensional hyperplanes that separate the data. SVM is particularly adept at handling non-linear problems and can employ various kernel functions to manipulate data in a high-dimensional space, often as an alternative to polynomial, radial basis function, and multi-layer perceptron classifiers. An SVM classifier endeavors to minimize a specific function involving the separation of training data with high generalization capability, leading to robust solutions.

Radial Basis Function (RBF) networks, another noteworthy technique, are used across various domains including system control and classification. RBF networks aim to predict behavior directly from input-output data and work by minimizing a defined error function.

In the study under discussion, correlation analysis was initially employed to uncover relationships between features, revealing that relative humidity (RH) had a weak correlation with other variables. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) was then used to cluster the data excluding the RH column. However, this approach increased both computational costs and prediction error, which led the researchers to utilize Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to optimize the selection of highly correlated variables within the dataset.

PCA works by selecting components that represent a desired proportion of variance or exceed a set communality threshold. The pseudocode for PCA focuses on identifying eigenvalues and eigenvectors corresponding to these criteria. Using a dataset referred to as MNP in the study, SC techniques were applied following PCA and PSO clustering to find the most effective predictors for forest fires. Comparative results indicated that SVM achieved superior accuracy relative to other methods.

The paper summarizes an academic approach to forest fire prediction using SC techniques, particularly emphasizing the effectiveness of SVM when applied after data preprocessing with PCA and PSO for feature selection and clustering.
