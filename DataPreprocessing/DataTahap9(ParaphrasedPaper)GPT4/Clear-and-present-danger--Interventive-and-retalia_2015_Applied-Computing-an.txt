The paper discusses the difficulty that policy makers and practitioners face in identifying potential cyber threats promptly. The analysis of cyber strategies offers a crucial glimpse into how organizations, and particularly governments, struggle to meet the expectations of their stakeholders amidst factors such as alliances, cooperation, socio-demographic values, and other practical considerations.

The paper suggests that policies and retaliatory actions should make clear predictions about how inputs (processes), tactics, and desired outcomes (like reducing threats and validating security measures) are related.

This study focuses on whether current efforts adequately address the varied needs for effective cyber security practices. The authors review existing work, particularly in key sectors like telecommunications, transportation, and electricity, to gauge the emphasis on cybersecurity research and its impact on practical application and reproducibility of strategies.

The work prioritizes certain industries for analysis, including academia, government, and private finance, within a set assessment period to best represent ongoing cyber security research trends. The focus encompasses various regions, with an emphasis on areas recently affected by cyber attacks, such as the Philippines, South Korea, Vietnam, the US, and Australia. Data is drawn from three organizations with a presence in the UK, US, and Asia, including a recent survey on cloud computing risks. The choice to examine cloud computing reflects its widespread adoption and associated risks.

The paper stresses the importance of identifying and distinguishing cyber attacks and considering their impacts, as well as responding with appropriate action. The authors note a lack of effective strategies and resources for cybersecurity drawn from a static observation of incidents, meaning limited interaction and information.

Efforts to handle cyber attack reports should involve a dynamic, multi-faceted approach with communication and intelligence sharing among responders, the affected parties, and those establishing governance.

There have been developments in conceptual frameworks to detect cyber threats, tailored to regions that have experienced them. Longitudinal studies across industries can help create methods to identify, validate, and resolve cyber threats more rapidly, although securing cyber infrastructure remains challenging.

Finally, the paper highlights that alliances and interactions enable access to more experts and tools. Raising awareness is key, and while some organizations have limited chances to form alliances, engaging with other communities is crucial for developing effective cybersecurity strategies.
