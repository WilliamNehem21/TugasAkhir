Abstract Interpretation is an established methodology for developing program analyses by abstracting standard program semantics. This approach yields an abstract semantics that approximates actual program behavior, enabling property extraction without full execution.

This paper introduces a top-down algorithm devised to approximate analyses for programs featuring dynamic control-flow, where runtime variable values dictate control-flow paths. These programs are prevalent in advanced programming paradigms like higher-order and object-oriented languages.

It's shown that time-stamps-based constant propagation yields at least as good results as traditional, less sophisticated analyses and comes with a complexity trade-off.

Previous research by Le Charlier and Van Hentenryck on fixed-point algorithms for abstract interpretation in logic programs influenced this work. Their generic top-down approach and comparison with bottom-up strategies are of particular relevance. Their precision in computing the least fixed point contrasts with our time-stamps-based method, which focuses on efficiency and reuse of intermediate results while managing recursion.

The time-stamping method, originally proposed by Shivers, had not been fully explored before our formalization and correctness proof.

Potential improvements to the time-stamps-based algorithm include optimizing the order in which nodes are processed, as the current sequence affects the analysis outcomes. Moreover, duplicated work due to multiple independent edge processing could be reduced. These areas, including algorithm enhancements and their validation, are subjects of ongoing research.
