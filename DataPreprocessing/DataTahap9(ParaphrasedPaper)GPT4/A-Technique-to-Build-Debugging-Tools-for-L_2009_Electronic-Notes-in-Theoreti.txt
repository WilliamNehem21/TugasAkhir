This study focuses on a novel technique designed to construct debugging tools for lazy functional programming languages. By utilizing this technique, the execution of a lazy program can be replicated under a strict semantics framework by capturing and recording details about unevaluated expressions. This captured data, known as an oracle, is highly compact and essentially tracks the number of necessary strict steps before an unevaluated expression is omitted. The technique has proven effective, having been used to create a debugger for such programming languages.

The research solidified a method for the automatic recording and replaying of execution steps, confirming the method's validity and examining the resource requirements for computing oracle data. Subsequently, a debugging tool that leverages this oracle technique was proposed for lazy functional programs, and this paper progresses that technique to accommodate functional logic languages.

To contextualize the technical solution, the paper presents two common examples: the nondeterministic operation symbolized by "(?)" which chooses nondeterministically between two given arguments, and the relationship between generators and free variables demonstrated by a narrowing example involving the expression `(guard(head(genlist genbool())) 1)`.

To interpret the search tree as a concrete value, a set of choices is defined, each indicating which alternative to select for a given reference. For instance, the choice (1,1) suggests the first alternative for reference 1. Projecting the search tree with choices `[(1,1),(2,2),(4,2)]` would yield the list `[1,2,3]`. The paper explains how to construct these sets of choices systematically and how this facilitates simplifying functions like "sorted" to match single constructors, easing computational continuation in 'or' node arguments.

The paper also addresses the separation of the main computation into deterministic derivations and projections, emphasizing that the oracle technique for replaying functional programs can be readily adapted to functional logic programs. The approach supports implementing search strategies, such as depth-first search, compatible with the search tree model.

The research discusses the implementation of these ideas into a debugging tool for the Curry language, enhancing a prior tool developed for Curry's functional subset. It describes how Curry derivations are presented to users, incorporating techniques like "bubbling" to manage tuple constructors and references.

One unresolved issue is integrating the unification operator "=:=" into the oracle approachâ€”this operator enables functional logic programming beyond the constraints of narrowing by binding variables to variables. This paper outlines preliminary ideas to address this but defers an in-depth solution for future exploration.

Lastly, it points to the necessity of extending the projection approach to include a constraint solver, an aspect reserved for subsequent investigation.

In summary, this research expands on an efficient method for debugging lazy functional and functional logic languages, capturing execution information in a compressed format, and discusses the possible evolution of this technique to support more advanced features of these languages.
