The study addresses the issue of dissatisfaction among users with the performance of Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) systems, attributed to the existence of a 'semantic gap'â€”the disconnect between the search results that users find relevant and the ones the system deems relevant. To enhance CBIR system efficacy, bridging this gap is necessary, taking into account the user's mental model of their needs and the system's query-based relevance.

The paper is organized into several sections, with Section 2 introducing the proposed approach, Section 3 detailing the materials and settings considered, Section 4 discussing the conducted experiments and their outcomes, and the conclusion providing a summary and future perspectives.

The proposed approach operates by initially returning a set of images in response to a user query. The user then marks some images as relevant, and those not assessed by the user are automatically labeled as non-relevant. To refine the search, a variety of similarity and distance measures are applied, including Euclidean, intersection, and various quasi-distances, and the Jeffrey divergence.

The core of the study is the exploration of 18 different matching measures within CBIR systems, involving similarities, distances, quasi-distances, and divergences. It introduces a novel method that uses the Sequential Forward Selection (SFS) algorithm and relevance feedback to identify the most effective matching measure for any given query. This represents a shift away from traditional feature selection methods in CBIR to a focus on matching measure selection. Promising improvements in precision, recall, and utility value were observed with this new approach.
