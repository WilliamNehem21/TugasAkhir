Recent research has drawn considerable interest in the field of social networks from various disciplines like sociology, informatics, and computer science. Social networks, which consist of entities such as individuals or organizations and the connections between them, present a rich data source, making it essential to tackle various network-related issues. Studies in sociology have explored numerous topics, including social influence and the identification of least-cost paths within networks.

A particular focus has been on the shortest path (SP) problem, which seeks to find the least expensive path from one point to another within a network. The point-to-point (P2P) problem specifically looks at identifying the minimum-cost path from a source node to a destination node. There are other variations of the SP problem, which include finding paths from a single source to multiple destinations or between all pairs of nodes within the network. Single-source shortest path problems with non-negative edge weights have been the most extensively studied.

Dijkstra's algorithm is a well-known solution for such problems in both weighted and unweighted networks, although it may be computationally intensive (with a time complexity of O(n^2)), making it less practical for large-scale social networks. Modified versions of the breadth-first search are more time-efficient (with a time complexity of O(n)) but are best suited to unweighted networks. To improve the efficiency of SP algorithms in large networks, researchers have utilized domain-specific information and natural hierarchies, particularly in traffic networks. However, these methods may not be directly applicable to social networks.

The focus of the paper is to introduce an SP algorithm that leverages community features, a key characteristic of social networks. The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 details the proposed Shortest Path based on Community Detection (SPCD) algorithm. Section 3 discusses the experiments conducted on five datasets, analyzing the algorithm's accuracy and efficiency, and examines the effects of community pathway number and community detection methods on the SPCD's performance. The conclusion and future research directions are presented in Section 4.

The proposed algorithm starts by defining community detection, followed by constructing a community graph. It then outlines how to determine the k shortest community paths and find the shortest path within sub-graphs. The SPCD algorithm is novel in that it uses community information from the network, thus refining the search for SPs by focusing on relevant communities.

Xie et al. proposed a speaker-listener label propagation algorithm (SLPA) for community detection in weighted networks. The SPCD algorithm outlines in this paper, however, does not directly apply this method but reverses the target network prior to implementation. This approach creates a weighted community graph where all nodes within a community are treated as a single node, simplifying the original network and enabling the calculation of the k shortest community paths.

The experiments utilized various datasets, including the coauthorship network of scientists working on network theory (net-science) compiled by M. Newman and datasets from the nuclear experiment archive (nucl-ex). The algorithm demonstrated efficiency and an acceptable approximation error, showing its potency for various community detection methods. Future work will aim to improve heuristic methods for integrating community information to address the SP problem in weighted social networks and explore community detection algorithms suitable for these social networks.
