This academic paper presents the creation of an algebraic foundation for graph-based structures that are commonly used in diagrammatic representations for specifying, modeling, and programming computing systems. Specifically, the authors explore the use of hypergraphs and higraphs, defining a new concept of a locally ordered category graph(C) of graphs within a category C and equipping it with a symmetric monoidal closed structure. Additionally, they generalize certain operations on higraphs and related structures that they deem important for computing applications.

The paper discusses the use of higraphs' hierarchical edge systems for efficiently specifying complex reactive systems. They introduce a "completion operation" for understanding the semantic impact of high-level edges in higraphs. They demonstrate that this completion operation can be understood as a right adjoint to the inclusion of graph(C) into another structure, graphopl(C), characterized by having oplax natural transformations as its arrows. They also prove a theorem under which these right adjoints exist.

The authors delve into the practical application of higraphs in the context of statecharts, a tool used for modeling complex reactive systems that feature concurrency. The motivation stems from the inadequacy of using transition systems to represent these systems when the number of states becomes unmanageably large. Statecharts address this issue by focusing on subsets of concurrent states within a system.

Additionally, they discuss limitations in the context of a set category C, where certain results do not align with the cartesian closed structure of graph(C) due to the behavior of the left adjoint which does not preserve units in the expected way.

To effectively articulate their theorem, the authors refer to the theory of 2-categories and the concept of oplax limits, indicating that a background understanding of certain higher-order category theory concepts may be necessary.

The paper concludes with an example illustrating the challenges of extending certain operations to graphs in different categorical contexts, such as posets and relations. The authors' goal is to incrementally develop detailed structures capable of modeling realistic diagrammatic notations, especially statecharts enriched with features of higraphs and hypergraphs, by building the abstract foundations for a theoretical framework where various graph notions and their combinations can be analyzed.
