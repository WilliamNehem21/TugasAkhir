The abstract outlines research on covert communication through text steganography with a focus on Arabic text. The researchers propose a novel algorithm that embeds hidden information into text with minimal changes, making it less noticeable and more resistant to detection. They highlight the challenges of text steganography, such as the lack of redundancy and human sensitivity to text irregularities, which is particularly pertinent in Arabic due to unique language features such as the variable shapes of letters depending on their position in a word.

A notable characteristic of Arabic that the algorithm exploits is the use of dots in certain letters. Special fonts and considerations of isolated letters, based on their position at the beginning or end of words, play a critical role in hiding information efficiently without drawing suspicion.

The paper reports high embedding capacity in the carrier media and resilience against common attacks. They tested their method on various Arabic text files and noted the potential to apply it to both digital and printed media. By scanning printed documents with hidden data, the information can be extracted using the proposed algorithm. Future work aims to further increase the capacity ratio and refine the method for even more effective steganography in Arabic texts.
