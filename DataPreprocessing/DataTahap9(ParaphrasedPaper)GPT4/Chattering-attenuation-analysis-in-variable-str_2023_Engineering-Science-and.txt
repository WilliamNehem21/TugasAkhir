An academic paper discusses the limitations and improvements in variable structure control (VSC) when applied to electrical energy generation systems, particularly focusing on the Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR) used in power networks. A key limitation in VSC, known as chattering, arises from high-frequency switching in the control input, which can be detrimental to mechanical systems. To address this issue, soft switching techniques have been developed, which are robust against uncertainties.

Many research efforts have focused on creating optimal controllers for the AVR, which maintains stable voltage levels despite disturbances and aging-related uncertainties. However, most controllers have been designed based on a linear AVR model without real-world constraints, such as actuator saturation and exciter limitations.

A few studies have incorporated these constraints, showing the necessity of using more accurate nonlinear models. In recent research, both linear and nonlinear AVR models, with constraints including exciter saturation, were used to develop controllers like multi-term fractional-order PID controllers optimized with various algorithms.

The present study aims to tackle the problem of chattering in AVRs through VSC. It revises the conventional AVR model based on IEEE standards, including excitation constraints, and proposes a novel control design that employs soft switching functions to mitigate chattering. The optimization of the controller parameters is performed using Sine Cosine Algorithm (SCA) under various operating conditions.

The research indicates that while the signum function in traditional controllers causes unacceptable oscillations, soft switching functions can reduce chattering and maintain similar performance levels. The study contributes by focusing on the chattering attenuation capabilities of soft switching functions within AVR systems, a topic not extensively explored before. The findings highlight the importance of considering real AVR system constraints in controller designs and emphasize the advantages of using soft switching to avoid damaging power electronics due to excessive heat from chattering. The overall goal is to enhance AVR systems' performance without compromising their longevity or reliability.
