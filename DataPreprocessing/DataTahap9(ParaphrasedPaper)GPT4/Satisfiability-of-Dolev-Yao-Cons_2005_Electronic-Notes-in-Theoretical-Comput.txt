This academic paper is structured as follows. Section 2 revisits standard definitions related to Dolev-Yao constraints and introduces proper characterizations of well-formed and quasi well-formed constraints. In Section 3, a rewrite system is utilized to demonstrate that the satisfiability of well-formed constraints is a decision-making problem. Section 4 expands this result to include quasi well-formed constraints. Section 5 discusses the NP-completeness of satisfying these constraints. Section 6 explores the application of these findings in evaluating opacity in scenarios with an active intruder. The paper concludes with Section 7.

The paper then explains the Dolev-Yao constraints by presenting a typical example where a message \( m \) is said to be deducible from a set of messages \( T \), symbolized as \( T \vdash m \). This deduction is modeled with constraints that consider the sequence in which keys may be compromised. A message \( m \) is deducible if there exists a set of distinct keys in \( T \) and \( m \) such that each subsequent key is deduced using only the previously deduced keys, culminating in \( m \) being deduced from \( T \) with these keys.

An original decision-making procedure for the satisfiability of well-formed constraints is presented. The well-known NP-completeness of the satisfiability problem for constraints using a certain operator (represented as \( h \)) and its extension with XOR is acknowledged. This new decision procedure operates through a rewrite system on constraints. The authors aim to show termination of this rewrite system, the decisiveness of satisfiability for rewritten normal forms, and the correctness and completeness of their method. The procedure consists of rewriting the constraint into its normal form and then checking satisfiability.

Although the results are not entirely new—as they can be found in existing literature—the paper claims that their demonstration provides a simpler and more adaptable decision procedure. The method hopes to prove easily extendable to cases involving first-order symbols like \( f \), showing the decisiveness of opacity for active intruders, which will be explored in a later section.

Finally, the paper points out that when comparing two sets, \( E \) and \( E' \), they must be of the same length and structured in a way that enables performing identical operations on each—in this case, using ordered lists to represent the environments.
