The article presents the K framework, a tool for defining programming languages' semantics using rewrite logic. The K framework consists of K notation, a collection of syntactic conventions that improve the readability and ease of language definitions, and the K technique, which employs a continuation-based approach to define programming languages algebraically.

K framework allows language definitions to be translated into rewriting logic, facilitating the use of analysis tools designed for rewrite logic specifications, and into C to produce highly efficient interpreters. A simple imperative language with functions, named SILF, serves as a demonstration of the framework's capabilities, showcasing how K can be used to define language semantics.

The translation process into rewriting logic and C currently involves a mix of manual and automated steps, but the authors are optimistic that this could become fully automatic in the future. The goal is to enhance the framework further and develop tools for automatic parser generation and other static analysis tools that leverage the K definitions.

In summary, the K framework offers an innovative method for defining programming languages, with the ability to translate these definitions into practical tools for both analysis and interpreter generation. The authors anticipate continuous improvements in the framework and tooling as they accumulate more experience with K.
