The suffix tree, a crucial text indexing structure, is hindered by its high space requirements for large strings. The smaller suffix array is a key alternative that addresses string processing problems efficiently in both time and space.

One improvement, direct comparisons, enhances resource use, particularly in cache memory, thanks to better reference locality, which was a weakness in the original range minimum query (RMQ) based methods.

The "LV dmin" technique relies on direct comparisons bolstered by longest common prefix (LCP) information. It decides between direct comparisons and a simple scan based on the distance between suffixes in the suffix array, foregoing RMQ-LCP queries.

Experiments were repeated thrice, selecting the best runtime. Given the significant time variation between Landau-Vishkin method iterations, extensive statistical analysis was deemed unnecessary. A random 50-character pattern was consistent in its negligible effect on the time measurement. Various error levels were tested, alongside prefixed files from the corpora, with memory usage monitored by the malloc_count tool.

Potential enhancements suggest employing more space and time-efficient semi-external memory strategies, such as using a succinct alphabetical representation—like 2 bits per symbol for DNA sequences—or bit packing for simultaneous multiple symbol comparisons. Text compression enabling random access offers a method for handling enormous texts not fitting in main memory.
