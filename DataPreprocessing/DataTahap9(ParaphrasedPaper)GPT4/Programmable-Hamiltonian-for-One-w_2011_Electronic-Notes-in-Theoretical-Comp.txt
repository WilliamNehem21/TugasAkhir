In this paper, scientists introduce a family of stationary (time-independent) Hamiltonians capable of performing universally programmable quantum computation. They translate the code from one-way computer (quantum computer using measurement-based technique) language into instructions that dictate the evolution of such Hamiltonians. Additionally, they discuss methods for adiabatically reaching this Hamiltonian state, with the broader goal of enhancing the understanding of how measurement-based and adiabatic quantum computing models are interconnected.

The paper focuses specifically on exploring the structural relationship between Measurement-Based Quantum Computing (MBQC) and Adiabatic Quantum Computing (AQC). Although prior research has already proposed methods for adiabatically simulating circuits, these generally involve breaking down the circuit into multiple rounds of computation, each with a limited number of gates, to construct a corresponding local Hamiltonian. Some research has also leveraged adiabatic evolution to improve the robustness of MBQC.

The authors' approach stands out by offering a programmable Hamiltonian construction different from those previously known. They argue that the advantages of one-way quantum computing — such as its intrinsic parallel structure and the use of graph-theoretical techniques in algorithm design — combined with the benefits of continuous-time evolution in terms of programming and robustness, form the cornerstone of this study. This paper documents the initial steps in transforming one-way quantum computation patterns into Hamiltonian evolutions.

The paper concludes with a discussion on parallelism in quantum computing and how it has been handled in their construction. They suggest that although they can achieve the same depth complexity as the original one-way pattern by adjusting the dependencies of measurements and using established techniques to parallelize controlled gates, this might alter the dimension of the program register. However, they acknowledge that a full exploration of the link between locality and parallelism in quantum computing is beyond the scope of this paper, and would require further investigation.
