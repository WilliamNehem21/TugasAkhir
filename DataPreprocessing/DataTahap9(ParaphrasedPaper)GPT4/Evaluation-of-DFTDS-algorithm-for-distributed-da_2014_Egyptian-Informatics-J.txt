This academic paper presents a new query scheduling algorithm for distributed data warehouses, called Dynamic Fault Tolerant Dependency Scheduling (DFTDS), which is designed to effectively manage large volumes of data and the allocation of resources. The algorithm prioritizes queries based on their interdependencies and automatically assigns resources by monitoring the status of virtual machines, significantly improving response times and reducing memory usage.

The paper highlights the challenges in retrieving information from vast repositories and the inadequacy of existing algorithms to handle distributed data warehouse environments efficiently. To address these issues, the authors propose the DFTDS algorithm, which outperforms previous algorithms, including Group Fine Job Scheduling (GFJS) and Heuristic Algorithm (HA) as well as an existing data warehouse algorithm, WINE, and two other scheduling algorithms developed by the authors, namely DTDs and VMFTRS.

The study conducts a comparative analysis of query processing time and memory utilization across various sizes of query sets and resource groups. The DFTDS algorithm demonstrates significant improvements in processing efficiency and resource management by creating new virtual machines as needed to prevent failures and rectifying errors quickly.

Results indicate that the DFTDS algorithm has superior performance metrics compared to WINE, with notable improvements in processing time, memory utilization, and other parameters. Moving forward, the authors aim to develop an online and preemptive scheduling algorithm that can predict tasks and classify resources for enhanced efficiency.
