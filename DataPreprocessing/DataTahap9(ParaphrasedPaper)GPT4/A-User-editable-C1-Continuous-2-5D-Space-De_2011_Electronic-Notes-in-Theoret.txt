The authors developed a method for deforming 3D models, particularly those of microorganisms, which is user-friendly and implemented within an editor. This method allows users to easily create and modify deformations using a mouse. It uses prismatic cells within the control grid to reduce the number of control points, streamlining the editing and visualization process. The proposed technique is both simple and effective according to experimental results.

The structure of the paper is laid out as follows: Related work is reviewed in Section 2, foundational concepts are explained in Section 3, the authors' methodology is detailed in Section 4, and the results of their experiments are shown in Section 5. In Section 6, the paper concludes with a discussion and outlines potential avenues for future research.

The described method leverages a control grid composed of prisms along with spline surfaces to achieve 2.5D space deformations, ensuring that the model's surface maintains C1 continuity while being deformed. Results from their experiments confirm the methodâ€™s capability in simulating a variety of deformation types in biological structures.

For future research, the authors plan to enhance control mesh editing and deformation tools to better capture common large-scale deformations. They are considering multiscale editing improvements and exploring curve-based space deformation methods whereby each curve point represents a control point group. Another research direction includes adding volume-preserving constraints and preventing self-intersections.
