The academic paper discusses continuous relations in the context of formal topologies, which mirror the concept of locale morphisms within a constructive mathematics framework. The paper explains that a continuous relation's definition, often based on frame morphisms and expressed using relations, can be simplified when dealing with a unary formal topology that is related to a general one. This simplification enables the definition of an exponential topology for a unary formal topology when it is applied over one that is inductively generated.

The paper also includes a notable point in Remark 4.4, where it draws an analogy between the embedding of a formal topology into its unary representation and the embedding of a topological space into a Scott domain. The remark suggests that continuous relations in formal topologies are analogous to continuous functions between topological spaces, which can be extended to approximable maps in the context of domains.

Furthermore, the remark discusses the category of topological spaces, denoted by TOP, emphasizing its limitations in being cartesian closed. However, it mentions a significant result that, although TOP itself is not cartesian closed, its exact completion can form a locally cartesian closed category. This means that the category TOP, with an appropriate completion, can satisfy certain weaker versions of the exponentiation property, which is essential for establishing a locally cartesian closed structure.
