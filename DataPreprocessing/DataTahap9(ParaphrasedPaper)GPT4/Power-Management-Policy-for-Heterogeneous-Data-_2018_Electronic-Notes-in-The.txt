The paper examines the environmental impact of burgeoning cloud services and data centers, noting that they account for over 1.3% of worldwide energy consumption and significant carbon dioxide emissions. Urging energy-efficient strategies, it highlights that data centers are often designed for peak loads despite running at about 60% capacity. The bulk of data center energy use is attributed to powering and cooling servers, with substantial investment in low-energy components and cooling systems. Additionally, power policies for on/off server management are proposed to enhance service quality and energy use.

The study also addresses the challenges of computing optimal policies for massive Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), stressing the importance of understanding a policy's structural properties for more efficient computation. Several sources are cited regarding the investigation of such optimal policy structures.

The paper continues by describing a modeling process for job arrivals using discrete distributions based on real Google traffic data, a method to construct identically independently distributed (i.i.d.) discrete distributions, and a simple queue system model. The optimization challenge is then framed as a discrete-time MDP, followed by an evaluation of the optimal policy's structural properties.

In one example, job arrivals are modeled as a histogram with specific probabilities for differing numbers of job arrivals, offering insight into the job distribution at a data center. The paper also simplifies the diversity of servers in a data center into three energy consumption levelsâ€”high, medium, and low. The number of servers at each energy level fluctuates with the traffic load and predetermined performance metrics.

As computing the optimal policy for complex MDPs can be difficult, particularly for large data centers, the paper notes that the double-threshold policy structure found in homogeneous data centers does not necessarily apply to the more complex heterogeneous models they are studying.

A case study using real traffic traces from a Google data center demonstrates how the arrival of jobs and service rates can be represented by discrete distributions. It underscores the challenges of writing MDP specifications for large systems, revealing a tool they developed to automate this process.

Lastly, the paper presents findings showing that heterogeneous data center models are more energy-efficient than homogeneous ones, despite their larger size and the increased complexity of potential action combinations.
