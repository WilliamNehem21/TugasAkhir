In the paper, the authors explore various classes of models within the computational-calculus framework, presenting definitions and discussing the significance of each class. 

Firstly, they delve into the concept of closed-categories, which extend the idea of cartesian closed categories, a foundational structure in category theory. These categories are particularly relevant due to their role in representing computational processes and logic.

Next, they examine indexed closed-categories that draw upon indexed category theory and connect to contemporary compiler technologies, highlighting their practical applications in computer science.

Following that, they discuss cartesian closed categories that are augmented with A-enriched monads. This class of models boasts a well-developed theoretical framework, enabling researchers to bypass intricate coherence issues as suggested by Saunders Mac Lane's work on strengths within categories.

Additionally, the paper explains how cartesian closed categories and C-enriched monads simplify certain proof processes in abstract mathematics. The authors note the advantage of drawing from the extensive work on enriched categories, utilizing the 2-category C-Cat which comprises small C-enriched categories. This framework facilitates easy proof of relationships between computational effects. For instance, one can view partial functions as a subset of continuations by mapping monads related to partiality onto those associated with continuations, thus relieving the need to constantly address the interplay between strengths. When combined with axiomatic domain theory, this approach offers an effective way to model recursion within these computational models. Moreover, it stands out as the most fitting model class for representing operations linked to computational effects.

Lastly, the authors provide a formal definition of a C-category within the context of a cartesian closed (or, more broadly, a symmetric monoidal closed) category C. Distinctively, instead of having the traditional homsets that define a category, a C-category possesses homobjects from the category C, which further underpins their relationship with computational structures.

In summary, the paper delineates a spectrum of category-theoretic models that extend and enrich the conventional understanding of computational structures and their applications, highlighting both theoretical and practical implications of these models in computational-calculus.
