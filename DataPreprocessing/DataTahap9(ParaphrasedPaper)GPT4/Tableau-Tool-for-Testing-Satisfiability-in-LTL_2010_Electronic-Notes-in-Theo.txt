The academic paper indicates that despite the theoretical computational difficulty of certain problems, as learned from studies in description logics, many practically important problems can be resolved effectively, often with the help of optimization techniques. This trend is also observed in the context of Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), supporting the idea that worst-case complexity assessments should be cautiously considered when evaluating an algorithm's practical value.

The article also describes a methodology for testing tools used in the research. Specifically, they monitored memory consumption to prevent the reliance on virtual memory, which can significantly slow down processing. This careful monitoring was implemented during all tests to ensure genuine and efficient performance measurements.

Additionally, to verify the accuracy of the implementations, the researchers generated and evaluated large sets of formulas known to be either satisfiable or unsatisfiable. They used formula sets created by M. Montali for testing purposes. Testing these sets led to the identification and correction of a bug in a prior version of the software being examined.
