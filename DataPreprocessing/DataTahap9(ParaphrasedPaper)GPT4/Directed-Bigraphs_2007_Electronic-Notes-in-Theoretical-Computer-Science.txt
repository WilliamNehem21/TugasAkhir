In this paper, the authors present directed bigraphs, a new model which encompasses prior theories. A directed bigraph is made up of a place graph and a directed link graph, an innovative adaptation of input-linear and output-linear link graphs. This model elaborates on the construction of Reactive Process Objects (RPOs) and Interaction Process Objects (IPOs), offering an advanced and comprehensive version of previously known methodologies. Notably, this is the first construction of IPOs for input-linear bigraphs known to the authors.

Directed link graphs are proposed as the fusion of input and output linear link graphs built upon the same foundation, as inspired by R. Milner's ideas. This requires dividing control ports into two groups: one associated with the input linear link graph and another with the outer linear link graph. This split assigns a distinct direction to each connection, naturally ensuring that no two names in the same interface are linked.

The paper also examines the possibility of employing this model for calculating Locally Universal Hexagons (LUXes). The authors conclude that although directed bigraphs contain RPOs and Reactive Process Bisimulations (RPBs), they do not have all LUXes; an example is provided to illustrate that RPOs and RPBs may not always interoperate smoothly, as inferred from cited literature.

The authors suggest that Input-linear link graphs can be viewed in terms of input-linear cospans within an adhesive category of hypergraphs (LGraph), leading to an alternative RPO construction matching directed and output-linear link graphs without the complexity of 2-categorical machinery. This tailoring aids in a clearer comparison between models.

As a future endeavor, the authors aim to utilize directed bigraphs to map out computational calculi related to resources, locations, and similar aspects through edges. They anticipate examining the type of broad transition system that might emerge from their conceptual framework in such scenarios.
