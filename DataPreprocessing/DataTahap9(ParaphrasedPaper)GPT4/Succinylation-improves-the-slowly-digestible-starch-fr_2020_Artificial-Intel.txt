The research explored the enhancement of the slow-digesting starch content in Cardaba bananas using a chemical modification process involving octenyl succinic anhydride (OSA). The study evaluated the predictive performance of nonlinear (Response Surface Methodology [RSM] and Artificial Neural Network [ANN]) and linear (Partial Least Squares [PLS]) modeling techniques. The findings demonstrated that all models were effective at forecasting the experiment's outcomes. The RSM model's optimal conditions for the highest yield of slow-digestible starch (SDS) included an OSA concentration of 4%, a reaction time of 47.49 minutes, and a pH level of 10, predicting an SDS value of 44.64%. Within the tested models, ANN proved to be the best predictor for SDS yield enhancement. The PLS model highlighted OSA concentration as a critical factor influencing the SDS yield, as indicated by the regression coefficients and Variable Importance in Projection (VIP) values. Additionally, a comparison between the optimized and native starch structures revealed that the modified starch acquired a more organized crystalline structure as a result of the OSA attachment to the Cardaba banana starch's hydroxyl groups.

Green bananas, originating from Southeast Asia, are a widespread plant within the Musa genus. Despite ancient global trading leading to their cultivation across over 100 countries, the Cardaba banana (Musa abb) is especially common in Southwestern Nigeria. These bananas have a high potential for food product development but also a susceptibility to post-harvest spoilage due to moisture content and metabolic features. Cardaba bananas are notable for their high starch content, crucial in starch production.

Resistant starch, a type of starch that evades small intestine digestion and is fermented by colonic microbes to produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), supplies additional energy to the body. SCFAs are also important for their cancer-preventive properties in the colon. Foods high in SDS and resistant starch correlate with a lower glycemic index, prompting the modification of native starch to meet the growing demand for low-glycemic index food products.

RSM is a statistical and mathematical modeling approach for determining optimal processing conditions in various food processing applications, including starch production. On the other hand, PLS regression, primarily used for other applications, allows for constructing relationships between two kinds of experimental data sets and is compared with other techniques like ANN in specific food-related studies.

The ANN optimization in this study was based on previous methods applied to predict SDS outcomes using different transfer functions, learning algorithms, and network architectures, with an aim to establish the optimal network structure. The training process involved complex interactions between input, hidden, and output layers, with a large number of iterations to determine the best model parameters.
