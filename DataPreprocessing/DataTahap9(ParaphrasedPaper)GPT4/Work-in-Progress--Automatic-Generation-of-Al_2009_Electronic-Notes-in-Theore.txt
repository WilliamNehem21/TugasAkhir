The academic paper discusses the challenges and a potential solution for integrating algorithm visualizations into teaching materials. Despite the educational potential of such visualizations, their adoption in classrooms has been limited. One obstacle is that these visualizations are often standalone systems, which makes them cumbersome to incorporate into lectures. Moreover, the use of visualizations from different developers can lead to inconsistencies in design and terminology, causing confusion.

Another issue addressed is the difficulty of preparing for lectures that incorporate visualizations due to potential technical issues, such as unreliable network connections or compatibility problems with the lecture hall's equipment. Consequently, instructors often rely on their personal laptops to ensure presentations run smoothly.

The authors note that until recently, a significant barrier was the proprietary formats of presentation tools which have prevented easy integration of visualizations into slides. The development of open XML-based formats, specifically Office Open XML for PowerPoint and Open Document Format (ODF) for OpenOffice Impress, has eased this process. Furthermore, the use of XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations) allows for transformation of XML documents into formats compatible with these presentation tools.

The paper describes a method to create algorithm animations as slides within an ODF presentation. This method involves converting SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) files into ODF slides via a Java-based implementation and XSLT transformations, allowing graphical elements to be integrated seamlessly into presentations. The output is a fully edited presentation in ODF.

This approach to creating slides enables educators to edit and tailor visualizations to their teaching needs by adjusting terminology, colors, or language, and by adding explanatory notes. It also allows the modification of visualization parameters to suit the audience. The paper also mentions the challenges faced during the implementation, such as unclear namespace specifications within the ODF format and issues with positioning graphical elements.

The vision outlined in this work is to facilitate the creation of algorithm animations directly as presentation slides, which would make it easier for teachers to incorporate them into their lectures, making the sessions more interactive through dynamic documentation and lecturer notes.
