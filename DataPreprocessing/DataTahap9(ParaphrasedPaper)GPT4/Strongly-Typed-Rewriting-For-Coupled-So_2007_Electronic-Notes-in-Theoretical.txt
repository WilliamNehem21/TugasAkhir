This academic paper discusses the process of coupled transformations in software evolution, specifically focusing on the coherent modification of data types, their instances, and the programs that process them. The authors have previously formalized the transformation of data types and instances and now extend this work to include corresponding data processing programs.

They utilize Generalized Abstract Data Types (GADTs) to type-safely represent both migration functions and data processors, applying program calculation rules within strategic rewrite systems to achieve these transformations. Point-free representation simplifies the calculations. 

The process is two-fold: first, a type-changing rewrite system is used to migrate from a source type to a target type along with migration functions. Then, a type-preserving system rewrites the combination of a migration function and a data processor, ensuring they operate on the correct type without dependency on the original data type or processor.

The challenge tackled in this paper is to derive new processors that operate independently of the original types and migration functions by applying strategy and calculation techniques like fusion, which eliminates intermediate data types, enhancing efficiency.

The paper outlines how these rewrite systems rely on strong, type-safe representations and the need for a general framework to handle these complex transformations. Additionally, they explore alternatives to GADTs and the responsibilities of ensuring properties like termination and confluence in the transformations.

The paper also touches on related work and the use of various computational techniques to facilitate program transformation while maintaining type safety and preserving the semantics of the programs.
