In Definition 3.1, the sets of formulas bbind, bbid, bbit, bbig, cbind, cbid, cbit, and cbig represent the collection of propositions from the logics BBI (Boolean Bi-Intuitionistic) and CBI (Classical Bi-Intuitionistic) respectively, that are universally valid in specific classes of structures. These classes are categorized as NDM (Non-Deterministic Monotone), DM (Deterministic Monotone), TM (Total Monotone), G (General), NDG (Non-Deterministic General), DG (Deterministic General), TG (Total General), and G (General) respectively. Each set is defined by the formulas of BBI or CBI that hold true for all structures within its associated class.
