This study examines the unique characteristics of hydrogen-electric motorcycles and explores the influence of green consumption attitudes, perceived risk, and perceived value on consumers' purchase intentions. It aims to understand how these factors impact the decision to buy hydrogen-electric motorcycles and to provide insights that could be informative for both government bodies and relevant industries and researchers.

The research collects data using a survey conducted from January to February 2012 across five major urban areas in Taiwan, including Taipei, Hsinchu, Taichung, Tainan, and Kaohsiung, with respondents being adults over the age of 18. The sample size from each region was based on the proportion of the local population. Out of 500 questionnaires distributed, 468 responses were received, and after excluding 37 invalid responses, 431 valid questionnaires were obtained, resulting in an 86.2% response rate.

The study finds a direct effect of 0.18 and also notes indirect effects: perceived risk positively influences purchase intention through green consumption attitudes, with an effectiveness of 0.09, and perceived value also has a positive indirect effect of 0.24 through the same attitude. The total effects of perceived value and green consumption attitude on the intention to purchase hydrogen-electric motorcycles are 0.15 and 0.42, respectively.

The research confirms the value-attitude-behavior theory proposed by Macarthy and Shrum (1994), asserting that perceived value is a critical determinant of consumer attitudes and ultimately, behaviors. Additionally, it supports the findings by Monroe and Krishnan (1985) that consumer-perceived value has a direct impact on purchase intentions, particularly with respect to hydrogen-electric motorcycles.

In light of the increasing focus on environmental sustainability and green consumption, the study suggests governments should engage in educating consumers through various media and promotional campaigns that advocate green policies. Ensuring transparent communication between the government, businesses, and consumers can build trust and understanding. Also, implementing robust regulations to support green products, which often lack competitiveness due to higher prices, is essential. Over time, as the supply of recycled materials grows, this could lead to better negotiating power for vendors and more competitive pricing for green products. The study advocates for collaborative efforts by the government, businesses, and consumers to achieve sustainable development.
