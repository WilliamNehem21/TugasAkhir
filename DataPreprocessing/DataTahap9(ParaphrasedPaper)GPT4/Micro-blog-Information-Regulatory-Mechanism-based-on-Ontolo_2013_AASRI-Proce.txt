Since its advent, microblogging has become a popular online application beloved for its real-time updates and ease of use. Microblogging platforms have amassed a significant user base and offer a relatively open space for expression, allowing them to become powerful tools for monitoring societal trends. By 2011, the number of microblog users had surged to over 195 million, marking an explosive annual growth rate of 208.9%. Microblogs are utilized for a variety of purposes, including real-time reporting on significant events like the Fukushima earthquake and hosting micro-interviews, indicating their deep cultural resonance and substantial social impact. The rapid, viral spread of information on microblogs can have far-reaching effects, and even minor errors can lead to substantial negative consequences, thus raising ethical considerations. As these platforms can potentially disrupt moral norms and behaviors, their ethical implications have become more evident and concerning. In response, the academic world has started to take the regulation of microblogging seriously, resulting in initiatives such as developing self-regulatory codes for microblogging services, encouraging providers to manage content responsibly, and urging users to enhance their moral awareness, self-regulate their conduct, and monitor for offensive content to elevate their ethical standards.

To facilitate ease of use, microblogging platforms have eliminated rigid categorization systems in favor of user-generated tags. While tagging allows for the efficient aggregation of related content, the absence of controlled semantic relationships can make browsing and searching less user-friendly. By integrating tagging with other informational organization methods, these systems can optimize user experience without increasing user costs. Internationally, researchers are pioneering efforts to mine data from tags and construct ontologies based on folksonomy to improve the system.

However, creating ontologies is complex and challenging. Current ontological structures are often outdated and fail to provide immediate updates, causing a disconnect between ontology creation and usage. The author suggests that combining the strengths of ontologies and folksonomies can lead to an integrated structure that draws from both methods. In practice, users apply folksonomy by tagging microblog posts, producing metadata in natural language without restrictions to vocabulary. System-level metadata can organize these tags for better utility. Due to the sheer volume and dynamic nature of tags, it's impractical to create an ontology for each. Instead, the focus should be on optimizing popular tags for ontology construction.

To accommodate the requirements for ontologies informed by folksonomy, the author proposes a simplified ontology model – referred to as "micro ontology" – which retains concepts, attributes, examples, and semantic relations, streamlining traditional ontology models to suit microblog data. Micro ontology creation is facilitated by technologies like RSS, which aggregates diverse data across platforms.

The spread of information on microblogs can be characterized by several key features: (1) fragmented information, with microblogging offering a faster communication mode than blogging, allowing for quick and brief exchanges; (2) an aggregated audience; (3) real-time interaction; and (4) content dissemination, whereby microblog data is searchable and can be distributed through RSS technologies.
