This paper presents a novel videoconferencing system that enables three users to engage in audio and video sharing via their web browsers, eliminating the need for additional software or plugins. Additionally, a fourth participant can contribute via voice through a phone call from the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). The system utilizes the WebRTC API, a component of HTML5 specifications designed to facilitate the exchange of audio, video, and data between two users accessing a web application, overcoming networking barriers like Network Address Translation (NAT) and mediating media types and formats through prior negotiation.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 outlines the project's background and compares it to similar projects. Section 3 describes the principles behind the proposed approach. The system's workings are demonstrated in Section 4, and Section 5 concludes the paper with an outlook on future work.

Before the advent of WebRTC, videoconferencing solutions like Cisco Webex were prevalent, particularly in the business sector. In contrast to these established systems, the project described in this paper builds on WebRTC, allowing users to operate the system within a web browser without downloading specialized software and giving them the freedom to utilize their own SIP trunk rather than relying on Cisco's infrastructure.

Integration with PSTN is achieved using an IP PBX server running Asterisk software, coupled with a SIP trunk from a telephony carrier. A custom module for audio mixing and distribution collects and blends the voices from the videoconference and channels them through WebRTC sessions and the Web Audio API, sending the composite audio to the IP PBX with a registered SIP user agent created with JsSIP. Upon receiving the external audio, it is distributed to the users in the conference room. The system currently supports only three web users and a single phone call at a time.

Asterisk, an open-source IP PBX server software with WebRTC capabilities since version 11, connects the web application to the PSTN, handling SIP over WebSockets. To enable WebRTC features in Asterisk, the libsrtp module must be installed, as WebRTC mandates that all media streams be secured via encryption provided by the Secure Real-Time Protocol (SRTP).

To deploy the system, the Asterisk server must be started first, followed by the web and signaling server via a command prompt. During a WebRTC session, the SDP messages revealed supported audio codecs (Opus, G722, PCMU, PCMA) and video codecs (VP8, H264) used by the web browsers.

In conclusion, the project successfully developed a web-based videoconferencing room integrated with PSTN calls, displaying the unifying capabilities of WebRTC for telephone networks and the internet. The main and specific objectives were met, as evidenced by implementing the functional videoconferencing system linked to the PSTN.
