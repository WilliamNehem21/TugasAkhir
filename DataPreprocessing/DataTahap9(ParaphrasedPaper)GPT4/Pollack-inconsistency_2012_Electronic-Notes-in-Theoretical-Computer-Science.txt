The academic paper you've shared discusses the importance of Pollack-consistency in interactive theorem provers. It is essential for these systems not only to maintain internal consistency—avoiding the proof of false theorems—but also to prevent users from mistakenly believing that a false theorem has been proved. The concept of Pollack-consistency is named after Randy Pollack and refers to the idea that what an interactive theorem prover prints out should be unambiguous and reliably parseable back into the system without errors or misinterpretations.

The paper reveals that many existing interactive theorem provers are not Pollack-consistent by demonstrating examples of where they fall short. These issues often occur when the systems print out terms or formulas that, when re-entered by a user, either cause errors or are misinterpreted by the system itself. This inconsistency between parsing and printing is a key focus.

To achieve Pollack-consistency, the authors propose a straightforward method. It involves a small alteration to the system's printing code, which governs how theorems and terms are displayed. This change would ensure that the output is reliably interpretable by the system and can be re-used in proofs without issue.

The paper acknowledges contributions from several individuals who inspired, advised, or provided examples for this research, including Randy Pollack, Mark Adams, Christian Urban, James McKinna, Josef Urban, and Makarius Wenzel.

The authors emphasize that compared to other methods of proof development, interactive theorem proving technology—which is still developing—has already led to significant formal theories. This technology is underpinned by LCF kernels that can be manually inspected or even formally verified, adding confidence in their correctness.

Despite the potential of interactive theorem proving, there is a dismissed concern within the user community regarding Pollack-inconsistency. Many users tend to consider issues with the printing function to be minor, as they believe they can adjust settings to display more information when needed. However, the authors of the paper stress the importance of addressing the parsing and printing discrepancies to improve the reliability and user-friendliness of interactive theorem provers.

In conclusion, the paper calls upon developers of interactive theorem provers to recognize the importance of Pollack-consistency and to take steps to adjust their parsing and printing mechanisms accordingly.
