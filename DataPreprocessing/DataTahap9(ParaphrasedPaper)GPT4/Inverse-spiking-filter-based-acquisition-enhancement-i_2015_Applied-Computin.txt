The academic paper discusses techniques for enhancing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) during data acquisition. The paper explains that one approach, coherent detection, involves dividing the input data into smaller blocks, removing the C/A code, and performing a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-based parallel code phase search, which effectively sums up the algebraically combined signal, as indicated by Bao-Yen and Tusi (2005). Conversely, in non-coherent integration, blocks of squared correlation values from the acquisition phase are summed up absolutely, which can double signal strength while impacting noise.

The paper goes on to detail the results of applying these methods. For coherent detection using a 10 ms integration period, an issue arises due to navigation data transitions, preventing the extension of integration time beyond 20 ms. As a result, this method has a limited detection capability, only able to ensure a 100% probability of detection at a C/N0 level of 35 dB-Hz. On the other hand, a non-coherent integration period of 36 ms leads to a 100% detection probability but only for signal levels around 30 dB-Hz. It is noted that both methods are ineffective in detecting weak signals at a power level of 20 dB-Hz.

The paper also examines differential detection methods, which underperform in that they offer only a 50% detection probability at the input power level mentioned. However, when combined with an inverse spiking filter, the differential detection method shows improved performance, achieving 90% detection probability for the PRN 3 signal.
