In this academic paper, the authors expand upon their previous work by introducing the concept of vertical refinement within their general model. Vertical refinement is explained as an extension of what is known previously in the literature as action refinement or non-atomic refinement. In another perspective, when considering a specific model from prior work as a logical theory, vertical refinement could be understood as theory morphism, which they elaborate on using the formalism of a Galois connection.

The paper discusses how this vertical refinement approach allows for the modification of certain interpretations that are typically fixed, through formal steps in the system development process. The authors illustrate the practical application of their definitions through several examples, demonstrating how natural development steps can be modeled.

One specific case study highlighted is the implementation of the IBP layer within the broadcast layer. The authors note the challenges encountered when trying to apply the same approach to implement handshake communication over broadcast, pinpointing issues with determinism definitions.

Further, the paper describes extension refinement and behavioral sub-typing as processes that uncover hidden events in the concrete version of an entity that are not visible in its abstract counterpart. The authors propose that these forms of refinement can also be formalized as special cases of theory morphisms.

The central idea relies on two semantic mappings: the first translates high-level abstract entities into low-level concrete ones, and the second does the opposite. For their vertical refinement to qualify as such, any refinement at the low-level must translate to a refinement at a high-level, and vice versa, establishing a Galois connection—or adjunction—between different layers of abstraction.

The authors describe how entities with high-level features represented by the alphabet ACTH can be refined vertically into entities that function entirely within the alphabet ACTL, all while maintaining the original specification's meaning.

This process allows for the postponement of interpreting the ISO Z semantics until the developer is ready. Such decisions can be seamlessly integrated into the existing formalism, ensuring the initial specification's relationship with its new interpretation remains intact.

When it comes to reducing nondeterminism, the paper discusses a refinement step where a developer limits a set to no more than three elements. This constraint ensures guarantees remain valid, provided the operations do not attempt to expand the set beyond this size.

The authors also explore how vertical refinement can be applied to processes with labeled transition system (LTS) operational semantics, enabling the refinement of processes based on one interaction style (e.g., handshake) into a process with a different interaction style (e.g., broadcast).

Lastly, the paper covers how subset morphisms can be used to model restrictions and hiding in process literature like CSP/CCS/ACP, and the reversal of this process introducing new events as a formal refinement step.

In conclusion, the paper defines a specific vertical refinement between high-level IBP entities and low-level broadcast processes and discusses the difficulties of extending this refinement to handshake processes, emphasizing the intrinsic complication in the abstraction of event synchronization.
