The development of electronic health records (EHR) over the years has resulted in the creation of substantial amounts of digital clinical data, enhancing the capabilities of clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) for improved decision-making. Notably, publicly accessible databases such as MIMIC-III have facilitated research in clinical predictions, leading to the development and continual improvement of various severity scoring systems, traditional machine learning models, and deep neural networks, which are employed for clinical prediction tasks including patient mortality, disease classification, and hospital stay duration.

Traditional severity scores like the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS-II), the Sepsis-Related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), and the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) are widely used in practice for mortality prediction. Typically, clinicians select patient-specific variables based on experience. These variables are collected within the first 24 hours after ICU admission to calculate a severity score, followed by the use of a straightforward model (e.g., logistic regression) to predict mortality risk.

This paper focuses on benchmarking three crucial clinical prediction tasks within critical care research: in-hospital mortality, ICD-9 code group prediction, and length of hospital stay prediction. These tasks are essential for patient care management in ICUs, patient diagnosis classification, and planning for hospital resource allocation, respectively.

A comprehensive feature set, comprising 136 time-series features and five non-time-series features, was curated based on clinical relevance and data availability, which includes all features used in severity scoring systems such as SAPS-II and SOFA. Several feature selection methods like genetic algorithm (GA)-based approaches, standard scoring methods, and machine learning techniques were evaluated against this feature set.

Specifically, two commonly referenced severity scores, SAPS-II and SOFA, served as scoring methods for feature selection. SAPS-II is intended to estimate hospital mortality probability and is derived from 17 variables, which correspond to 20 raw features within the full set. Similarly, the SOFA score is based on 6 variables, or 17 raw features from the full set.

Results indicated that GA-based feature selection consistently outperformed other methods. It is thought that this success is due to the GA's ability to find the local optimum as the number of iterations (epochs) increases, and potentially even the global optimum with sufficient iterations. Despite the longer computational time required to achieve high precision, this feature selection process is performed only once in an offline manner. As such, in actual clinical settings, doctors can rapidly make diagnoses based on a small subset of features, thanks to prior GA optimization.
