The academic paper discusses the vital role of forests in our ecosystems, providing a multitude of services that are essential both ecologically and socioeconomically. Chen and Meentemeyer (2016) emphasize, however, that invasive pathogens are posing an increasingly dangerous threat to the health of these forests. Given the limitations of management options, which can be constrained by cost or the extent of the pathogen's spread, it is of paramount importance to detect these invasive pathogens early and accurately, especially when they are not widely dispersed or are difficult to detect.

Traditional detection methods rely on visual inspection of symptoms, with molecular techniques employed for confirmation. These methods, while useful, can be cumbersome and error-prone. Molecular techniques, although precise, are laborious, expensive, and come with practical challenges, as noted by Schaad and Frederick (2002), and Fang and Ramasamy (2015).

Recent advancements in technology have led to new methods of plant phenotyping, such as spectral imaging coupled with artificial intelligence, which allow for rapid and precise early disease detection in both crops and trees. Spectral imaging is powerful because it captures both spatial and spectral information, allowing for the detection of subtle changes that indicate disease before symptoms are visually apparent.

For the study, the paper describes a process of preparing and analyzing spectra from leaf samples with hyperspectral imaging. The preparation involved removing wavelengths at the extremes, smoothing with a Savitzky-Golay filter, and reducing the number of features using a spectral binning function, as adapting from Wei et al. (2021a). Meanwhile, spectra derived from multispectral imaging were used directly.

To understand machine learning classification models better, the study looked at feature importance patterns in support vector machine (SVM) and convolutional neural network (CNN) models used for disease detection. For the SVM models, importance was measured by the weight coefficients for each variable. In the CNN model, based on the ResNet18 architecture and multispectral data, Grad-CAM heatmaps identified critical features for the modelâ€™s predictions.

The study also referenced the susceptibility and resistance of different elm genotypes to Dutch elm disease (DED), aligning with previous studies that categorized genotypes such as NA 57845 as susceptible and others like Princeton and RV 467 as resistant. Interestingly, genotype RV 141 showed tolerance initially but exhibited increased symptoms after a two-year period, as per Flower.

The findings revealed that hyperspectral imaging (HSI) was superior in detecting DED in its early stages, identifying changes in the plant before they became visible. In contrast, multispectral imaging (MSI) combined with deep learning was more effective once symptoms were visible, thanks to its ability to capture high-resolution images of symptomatic spots. The study further illustrates that imaging quality was greatly improved by the use of a custom imaging chamber, ensuring a high signal-to-noise ratio, which is indispensable for machine learning analysis.

Nonetheless, the study had limitations. The controlled environment conditions for the elm trees could affect the results, as would external factors such as different light conditions, seasonal changes, or other pathogens. Additionally, only four genotypes of American elms were included due to logistical reasons, suggesting that future research should examine more genotypes and validate the models in different environments to improve their robustness and applicability for DED detection and resistance screening.
