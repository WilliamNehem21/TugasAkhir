This academic paper discusses the use of many-sorted first-order language in functional translations to simplify presentations, and its implications for automated theorem proving (ATP). The authors introduce basic and optimized functional translations and provide proofs of soundness, with updates to include nominals and other hybrid language features.

The paper's main finding is that for modally definable classes of models, it is safe to remove sort annotations from formulas without affecting soundness. Variability of sort erasure's soundness is demonstrated with a counterexample from classes defined by pure hybrid axioms. The authors note the earlier work of Ohlbach and Schmidt, who proved that swapping consecutive quantifiers does not affect satisfiability, an approach the optimized translation uses to avoid Skolem functions.

Proposition 2.5, which claims that every satisfiable many-sorted formula matches a maximal model, is a critical component in validating the optimized translation. This reasoning parallels for g-maximal models in the basic translation.

The paper examines the necessity of many-sorted logic for both presentation and technical reasons, concluding that sorts can be omitted when dealing with disjoint union-closed classes of models, like modally definable classes.

Empirically, the effect of eliminating sorts on ATP performance remains uncertain. The paper suggests benchmarking ATP performance on functionally translated formulas, both with and without sorts, to investigate this. However, the authors caution that drawing conclusions from such experiments can be misleading due to various potential confounding factors.

The work further observes how functional translation extends well to hybrid logic, referencing Schmidt's finding that standard resolution theorem provers can decide basic modal language using optimized functional translation output. The authors suggest examining termination conditions for additional frame classes and whether termination can be obtained for hybrid language using "@" in future research.
