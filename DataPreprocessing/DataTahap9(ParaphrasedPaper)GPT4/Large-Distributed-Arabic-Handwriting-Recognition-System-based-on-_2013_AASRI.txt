The paper introduces a robust, efficient, and scalable Arabic handwriting OCR system that utilizes a parallel FastDTW (Dynamic Time Warping) algorithm through cloud computing. It employs Hadoop, MapReduce, and Cascading to implement the parallelism. The evaluations show that while the Euclidean distance technique for classification falls short in robustness, the DTW algorithm excels but suffers from slow response time due to computational intensity. Cloud computing offers a solution for accelerating DTW-based OCR systems, with services delivered on a pay-as-you-go model.

The paper is structured into sections covering the DTW algorithm, FastDTW, cloud computing models (Hadoop, MapReduce, and Cascading), the proposed approach, experiments, results, and conclusions with future work.

FastDTW, designed to reduce time and space complexity, is ideal for larger datasets. The MapReduce framework helps parallelize tasks over a cluster of virtual servers, as demonstrated using Amazon's cloud services.

The study uses a sizable dataset derived from the IFN/ENIT database, consisting of 16,000 pages and 345 representative Arabic character shapes. Wavelet transform is employed for feature extraction. Technical details include using a Windows XP system with 2GB RAM, coding in Java with JDK 1.6. Amazon EC2 instances with varying capacities and S3 storage are used for processing and data management.
