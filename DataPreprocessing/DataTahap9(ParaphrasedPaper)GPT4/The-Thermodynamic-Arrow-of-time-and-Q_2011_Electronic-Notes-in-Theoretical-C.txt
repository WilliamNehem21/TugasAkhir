The paper discusses how to reconcile the increase of entropy over time—a concept known as the thermodynamic arrow of time—with the underlying reversibility of quantum mechanics. The author addresses the Loschmidt paradox, which challenges the emergence of irreversible macroscopic behavior from fundamentally reversible microscopic laws. The proposed solution hinges on the idea that while both entropy-increasing and entropy-decreasing events occur according to the reversible quantum mechanical laws, only the entropy-increasing events leave observable evidence. This means that while entropy-decreasing events might technically happen, they don't leave any traceable impact, making it impossible to differentiate between such events occurring and not occurring. Consequently, the second law of thermodynamics, which states that entropy doesn't decrease, becomes a kind of tautology because we can only observe events in which entropy is not reduced.

The paper also suggests that invoking a typicality argument, which relies on probability distributions and expectations of typical behavior, might not fully resolve the arrow-of-time issue. It could still be necessary to assume that the universe began in a state of low entropy to fully explain the observed directionality of time.

Furthermore, the paper addresses a potential objection that an observer unaware of all possible correlations cannot accurately determine the entropy of a system. Since no observer can rule out the existence of unknown correlations with other parts of the universe without complete knowledge of the universe's state, it is necessary to assume that there are no correlations unless proven otherwise. An operational definition of thermodynamic entropy that accounts for all possible universal correlations would be practically infeasible.
