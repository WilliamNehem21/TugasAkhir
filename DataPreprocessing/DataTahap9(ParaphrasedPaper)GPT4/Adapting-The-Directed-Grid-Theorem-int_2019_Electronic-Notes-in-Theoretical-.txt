The Grid Theorem, initially proven by Robertson and Seymour in 1986, is a cornerstone in structural graph theory and has been widely used in algorithmic applications for undirected graphs. Its counterpart for directed graphs was posited by Johnson et al. in 2001 and subsequently proven by Kawarabayashi and Kreutzer in 2015. They demonstrated that for any given size k, there exists a function f(k) where any directed graph with a directed tree-width exceeding f(k) includes a cylindrical grid of size k as a butterfly minor. They further suggest that their proof could lead to an XP algorithm parameterized by k, capable of either constructing a required decomposition or identifying a significant cylindrical grid as a butterfly minor.

This paper refines Kawarabayashi and Kreutzer's approach, enhancing the XP algorithm into a fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithm. Directed graph analysis often involves width parameters similar to those used for undirected graphs, where the directed tree-width indicates the disparity from being a directed acyclic graph (DAG) while an arboreal decomposition reveals the connectivity of the original graph.

For certain problems, like the longest path problem, a high tree-width (suggesting a large grid minor) often implies dealing with a positive instance. A framework for converting such situations into fixed-parameter algorithms for bidimensional problems has been established, applicable to problems including vertex cover, feedback vertex set, and dominating sets.

An "irrelevant vertex" technique is used in various algorithms, where removing a vertex that does not affect the problem's solution simplifies the instance to something more tractable. The problem P, which is solvable in the XP class by evaluating all size r subsets of vertex sets, has been refined to also fall within FPT, reinforcing Theorem 2.9.

The FPT algorithm's efficiency for problem P is based on the limited number of partitions that can arise from a given instance, capped by the k-th ordered Bell number, which quantifies ordered set partitions and follows an exponential growth with regard to k. The paper finishes by explaining a lemma that aids in locating well-linked sets in directed graphs with large directed tree-width. Following the full proof of the directed grid theorem, FPT algorithms for all remaining procedures are substantiated, as highlighted in Corollary 2.13.
