The paper presents a novel strategy to address the bi-objective Distributed Heterogeneous Unrelated Machine Scheduling Problem (DHUPMSP), focusing on minimizing total tardiness (TDD) and the makespan. The authors introduce a Knowledge and Pareto-based Memetic Algorithm (KPMA) equipped with distinctive elements:

1) It incorporates four heuristics: Shortest Processing Time, Minimum Factory Workload, Minimum Machine Finish Time, and Earliest Due Date, alongside a hybrid heuristic method to initialize a diverse and convergent population.
2) The algorithm employs four tailored heuristic neighborhoods to improve local search success rates.
3) A simple elite strategy is implemented to better utilize historical elite solutions.

Evaluations against five contemporary algorithms across various instance sizes demonstrate that the hybrid initialization efficiently saves computational resources and helps achieve better initial convergence. Moreover, the neighborhood structures enhance exploration, and the elite strategy enriches the diversity of the Pareto solution set. KPMA outperforms existing solutions in handling DHUPMSP.

Subsequently, the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews literature on the topic. Section 3 outlines the DHUPMSP problem and presents a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model. Section 4 details the KPMA approach. In Section 5, numerical experiments validate the algorithm's efficacy. Section 6 discusses conclusions and future research avenues.

Earlier works suggest that while DHUPMSP is more challenging than Unrelated Parallel Machine Scheduling Problem (UPMSP) due to increased complexity, it has received less attention. This research addresses this gap by developing KPMA, informed by a review of previous methods and problem feature analysis. KPMA relies on a robust initialization phase, effective local search strategies, and a strategy to utilize past elite solutions.

In addition to elaborating on the KPMA's structure, which involves swarm initialization, a global search using NSGA-II, and a local search with Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS), the paper also includes algorithms and heuristic rules that inform its operation. KPMAâ€™s success in computational experiments is credited to the innovative initialization process, feature-based neighborhood search, and elite strategy formation.
