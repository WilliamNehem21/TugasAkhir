This paper discusses the importance of predicting bile salt export pump (BSEP) inhibition as a factor in drug-induced liver injury (DILI) risk assessment during drug discovery. BSEP safety margin, defined by the IC50/Cmax ratio, is monitored by Novartis's Pre-Clinical Safety department. A low BSEP safety margin is associated with a higher risk of serious DILI.

In a specific study, McLoughlin et al. assessed a wide range of predictive models for BSEP inhibition, crafting over 15,500 models with various algorithms and parameters. They found no clear advantage of deep learning methods and suggested using random forest (RF) with molecular operating environment descriptors, a conclusion that aligns with previous studies.

An in-house BSEP assay quantifies inhibition with IC50 measurements, using cells overexpressing human recombinant BSEP. Compounds are characterized with two-dimensional (2D) descriptors and Morgan fingerprints, aiding machine learning (ML) models in regression and classification tasks. Various ML methods are explored, including linear regression techniques like partial least squares and lasso regression, non-linear approaches like support vector regression, and tree ensemble methods for classification (e.g., ExtraTrees, RF, XGBoost).

The study optimized XGBoost parameters and evaluated model performance using metrics like AUC, MCC, and balanced accuracy (BA), finding that the model reliably predicts BSEP inhibitors.

The trade-off between training and validation data size is noted, an issue common in ML. The study emphasizes a balance between training data quantity for better model accuracy and sufficient validation data for performance estimation. The generalization ability of models is assessed over time and on representative test sets.

Results show that ML models outperform traditional strategies based on molecular weight and lipophilicity in ranking BSEP inhibition. This improved guidance for compound modifications can be more effective than considering those properties individually.

Overall, ML models offer a promising approach for early prediction of BSEP inhibition, which can influence decision-making in drug discovery. Such predictions can guide in vitro experiment prioritization and identify compounds with a lower risk profile early in development. The paper underscores the importance of robust ML model building and evaluation to support drug discovery and pre-clinical safety assessments.
