This academic paper addresses the challenge of detecting non-convex clusters within data, a well-explored issue in pattern recognition. Traditional clustering methods assume a single mean within a cluster, but current techniques utilize pairwise similarities and graph-based strategies to identify clusters regardless of their shape. These contemporary methods consist of two main operations: graph reduction and graph partitioning.

Kernel-based methods are one approach, which seek to project data points into a space where they can be more easily separated. However, a significant hurdle for graph-based clustering techniques is the necessity of creating a weighted graph where vertices within the same cluster are well-connected by high-weight edges.

Many research studies have suggested strategies to reduce graphs with tunable parameters to maintain these high-weight connections. Nevertheless, this introduces a new problem because these parameters often need to be specifically adjusted for different datasets, adding complexity to the clustering process.

The paper proposes a novel graph construction method to alleviate this issue. This method is also capable of integrating with SpectralNet, an advanced spectral clustering approach that utilizes deep neural networks. SpectralNet employs Siamese networks to learn relationships between data points based on user-provided labels indicating positive and negative pairs. However, the proposed method aims to automate pairing in an unsupervised manner to improve the efficiency of clustering.

Previous work in graph sparsification, such as the effective resistance-based method by Spielman and Srivastava, is cited as theoretically sound yet flawed in maintaining cluster graph structure. This suggests the need for new methods like the one proposed in this paper.
