The paper presents a refined version of the classic Tietze-Urysohn theorem within the context of a computable setting, specifically the Type 2 Theory of Effectivity (TTE). The classic theorem establishes that a continuous real-valued function, defined on a closed subset of a normal space, can be extended to a continuous real-valued function on the entire space. In this work, the authors demonstrate an effective or computable version of the theorem that applies to TTE.

Moreover, the authors introduce a new concept called quasi-normality, which represents a slightly broader condition than traditional normality but is more suitable for the class of QCB-spaces, which are a type of topological space that can be precisely studied within computable analysis. Quasi-normality is shown to be a sufficient condition for QCB-spaces to possess the function extension property for continuous functions defined on functionally closed subsets within these spaces.

The paper also dives into the categorical aspects of quasi-normal QCB-spaces, highlighting that they form a Cartesian closed subcategory of the more general QCB category and include all separable metrizable spaces â€” an important class of spaces in topology.

The authors also discuss properties relating to functionally open and closed sets within topological spaces. They mention a known feature where functionally open subsets retain their openness when considered within larger spaces, while functionally closed sets do not necessarily behave similarly. Despite this general observation, the paper asserts that within quasi-normal QCB-spaces, every zero-set (a generalization of closed sets where each point corresponds to the zero value of a continuous real-valued function) in a functionally closed subspace is also a zero-set in the larger space.

The proof of the effective version of the Tietze-Urysohn theorem is tackled by first establishing effective versions of underlying lemmas from Section 4, which support the theorem's conclusion. These effective variants are derived by adapting the proofs of their corresponding topological versions and employing computability techniques, specifically those outlined in Lemma 5.1.

Overall, the paper extends classical results in topology to a computable framework and broadens the class of spaces for which the theorem is applicable, providing insights useful in both theoretical and applied computational contexts.
