The academic paper describes an enhanced formalization of systems using the Z specification language, emphasizing the importance of clearly defining what parts of the state are observable and unobservable for security reasons. Z operations can be represented as partial relations, complicating their refinement proofs.

The concept of finalization solves logical dilemmas, such as preferring a slow clock over a stopped one, by providing a mechanism to rectify states. The focus of a process is defined by chosen observations, determining if one system refines another.

The paper recognizes that modern systems pose increasing security challenges, with surprising vulnerabilities discovered in recent years. A taxonomy is proposed to systematically analyze these threats.

Finalization is not only a formal concept but also practical, stressing that what an analyst observes depends on their vantage point. Covert channels may emerge when alternate finalizations allow access to different information. This consideration extends to environmental conditions and assigned operational ranges, which can also affect system finalization.

The paper discusses flexibility in interpreting environments, both concrete and abstract. It addresses deviations from pure refinement, the potential of higher order observations, and understanding that using multiple viewpoints can enrich analysis, especially for security purposes.

The paper examines potential vulnerabilities, like traffic analysis and timing attacks, and suggests defensive measures such as enforcing the use of intended "finalization glasses" or overwhelming potential attackers with excessive information.

Ultimately, the paper advocates for modeling systems from an attacker's perspective, taking into account potential deviations from assumptions that could lead to vulnerabilities, highlighting the boundless nature of the physical world from a security standpoint.
