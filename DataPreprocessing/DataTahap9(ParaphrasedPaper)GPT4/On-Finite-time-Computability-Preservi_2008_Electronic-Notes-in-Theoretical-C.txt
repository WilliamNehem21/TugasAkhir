In the discussed implementation, an infinite output list is generated from an infinite input list. Typically, the creation of the entire output list requires an unending series of 'cons' operations. Nonetheless, it's possible to create the output list using a limited set of 'tail' and 'cons' operations on the input. Essentially, the infinite output list is formed by joining a finite list with an ending segment of the input list, both derived from the initial infinite input. Consequently, when provided with the infinite input list, the infinite output list can be assembled in a limited amount of time.
