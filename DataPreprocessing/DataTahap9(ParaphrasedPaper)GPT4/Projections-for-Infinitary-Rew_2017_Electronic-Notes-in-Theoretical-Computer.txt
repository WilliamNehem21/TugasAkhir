The paper discusses the concept of projection within the context of infinitary rewriting and proof term models. The authors demonstrate through examples that their definition of projection aligns with expected outcomes, even in scenarios that are not fully accounted for by their partial confluence results. They point out that the computation of projections often doesn't require the use of limits except for determining the initial or final terms of a proof term. This applies even when projecting an infinite reduction over a finite one and vice versa.

The paper is structured as follows: the necessary background on infinitary rewriting and proof terms is presented in Section 2. A preliminary discussion is addressed in Section 3, and the specific definition of projection is introduced in Section 4, where it is analyzed using examples. The authors state and prove their partial confluence result in Section 5. Section 6 delves into situations where the notion of limit cannot be excluded from the definition of projection. The paper concludes in Section 7 with preliminary conclusions and possible avenues for future research, noting that further details and proofs are provided in an extended version of the paper.

Whilst the initial examples in Section 5 show that proper projections can be obtained for cases beyond those covered by specific lemmas, the paper acknowledges that the current definition doesn't always succeed, especially when dealing with projections between an infinite and a finite reduction. Observations of partial results approximating the final desired outcomes, and the projection of infinite compositions over others, indicate the necessity of integrating limits into the definition of projection to fully encompass all cases.

The research presented is a work-in-progress, aiming to characterize the projection of reductions based on proof terms. The authors identify future research directions, such as refining the definition to include all projections of an infinitary reduction and extending the soundness property to all types of projections. They also express interest in better delineating the current scope to determine when projections can proceed without explicitly using the concept of limits.
