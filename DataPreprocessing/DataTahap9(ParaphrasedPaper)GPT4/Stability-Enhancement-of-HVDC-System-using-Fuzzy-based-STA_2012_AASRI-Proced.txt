The advent of FACTS (Flexible AC Transmission Systems) devices has been driven by advancements in power electronic components, enabling high-power level converters capable of operating at high and very high voltage levels. These devices primarily modulate reactive power or the impedance within a section of the power network. Series-connected FACTS devices, in particular, are used for reactive power compensation and can modify the effective line impedance, thereby affecting power flow and system stability.

Research indicates that the use of a STATCOM (Static Synchronous Compensator) enhances system performance during both normal operations and transient conditions by effectively controlling power flow in transmission lines. Incorporating a STATCOM also helps to diminish fault current magnitudes and reduces oscillations in excitation voltage. Ensuring an adequate "current margin" is crucial to prevent the misfiring of thyristor valves. Both DC and AC filters are beneficial, not just in mitigating harmonic effects but also in lowering total harmonic distortion (THD). Compared to traditional controllers, a fuzzy controller results in a DC current that quickly returns to its nominal value following a disturbance, exhibiting fewer oscillations and a slightly lower overshoot.

STATCOMs prove economically advantageous for HVDC (High Voltage Direct Current) transmission systems as they allow for the transfer of more power with nearly unity power factor and reduced energy losses. Furthermore, STATCOMs enhance the flexibility of power grids by easing line congestion and facilitating more controllable power flows, making them particularly valuable in the deregulated energy market, offering an alternative solution to increasing power production for areas with high load demands.
