The academic paper details an enhancement to a previously introduced methodology for analyzing dynamic fault trees (DFT), which are used to study system reliability and failure processes. This paper extends the original method by incorporating maintenance operations, allowing for component replacement to improve system availability.

Dynamic fault trees model systems with components (leaves) and logical gates that process component statuses to determine if a system failure has occurred. The paper emphasizes that while most of the gates (OR, AND, and K/N) follow logical functions, the FDEP gate introduces dependencies among components, affecting the tree structure.

The extended approach directly uses discrete failure time distributions obtained from real-world measurements as input for component reliability analyses, bypassing the need for fitting these to theoretical models. The paper outlines a numerical method to calculate system reliability, integrating component rejuvenation through maintenance into the DFT analysis. This integration is notable because most literature doesn't include rejuvenation within the DFT framework.

The paper is structured into sections that discuss numerical algorithms for calculating failure time distributions, adapting methods to account for component rejuvenation, and providing illustrative examples. Unlike other models that often employ state-based Markov chains, this methodology uses discrete distributions for failure times without assuming exponential distributions.

When analyzing DFTs, particularly for events replicated across multiple components, the methodology accounts for dependencies between these components' failure times. It proposes efficient strategies to assess the reliability by focusing on relevant subsets of the fault tree.

For systems including maintenance interventions, the paper assumes the same maintenance schedules in the original and the bounding models to set limits for system reliability. This method allows for the calculation of system bounds over consecutive maintenance periods. The paper concludes with an application of the proposed methodology to a case study involving maintenance agents' actions on designated components within a specified timeframe.

In summary, the paper presents an innovative methodology to calculate and bound failure time distributions in DFTs accounting for component maintenance, resulting in a more realistic representation of system availability and reliability over time.
