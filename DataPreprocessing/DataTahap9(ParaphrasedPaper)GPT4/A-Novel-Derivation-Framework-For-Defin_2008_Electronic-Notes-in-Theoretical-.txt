The article explores the challenge of determining whether a closed atom is derivable from a definite logic program, a problem known to be undecidable. There are generally two approaches to tackle this issue: the accurate approach, which does not ensure completion, and the termination-guaranteed abstract approach, each with their own merits and drawbacks.

The paper introduces a new derivation framework for definite logic programs that incorporates features of both previous approaches. This framework includes a dynamic method for predicting the termination of fixpoint calculations. If the termination is anticipated, the accurate non-termination approach is employed; if not, the abstract method is chosen, which ensures termination. The aim is to merge the strengths of both methods to improve the efficiency of solving the derivation problem, and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this new approach.

This new framework involves a derivation algorithm, an abstract and refinement approach based on depth(k) abstraction, and an algorithm for predicting termination. The abstraction computes an approximation of the fixpoint, which could be refined by incrementing the threshold k if necessary to ensure the derivation algorithm's termination. If the abstract fixpoint suggests that a closed atom is not derivable, then it holds true. But if it indicates that the atom is derivable, further validation or refinement is needed.

The framework supports iteration through abstract refinement. Unlike previous algorithms, it uses the depth(k) abstraction which can be conveniently refined. The framework mechanizes the process of derivation, witness construction, and refinement.

A key insight is that in a definite logic program with finite rules, infinite repetitions in the solved-form fixpoint occur due to the recursive application of the same rule set. This recursion can either involve similar goals or a recursive increase in term size. The new prediction algorithm identifies the repetition patterns more accurately and efficiently since it focuses on the offspring of the same rule, instead of all the heads of solved form rules, to predict termination, and is therefore more precise and less resource-intensive.

In conclusion, the paper presents a novel method for termination prediction in definite logic program fixpoints, integrating both accurate and abstract approaches to efficiently address the derivation issue. The experimental findings affirm both the practicality of the termination prediction algorithm and the effectiveness of the new derivation framework.
