The paper discusses the behavior of multiple threads executing together with the only means of inter-thread communication being through stores and loads. It aims to ensure that any multi-threaded execution is serializable, despite potential reordering, and starts with a formal definition of serializability in the context of transactions.

The authors note that their example of a multi-threaded execution is just one of many possible scenarios. Depending on the sequence of events, threads may observe different stores, leading to varying orderings and visibility of data.

The paper acknowledges that the described approach may not handle programs with infinite loops well, as they could get stuck in graph generation and execution without resolving loads. They mention more sophisticated methods to address this, such as avoiding certain execution unfoldings.

Speculation differs from simple reordering because speculations can be incorrect. The paper suggests two ways to handle speculation: guessing values and verifying later (deferred for future work) or resolving instructions before all dependencies are met, which can lead to store atomicity violations.

Regarding operational limitations, the authors mention that load resolution is confined to transactions with both resolved and unresolved loads but conceptually can occur in any thread. However, an actual system needs to manage inconsistencies and decide what to roll back when they arise.

The paper reflects on the balance between clean specification and efficient implementation in the literature on memory models. It cites standard works that help explain the foundation of memory consistency.

In transactional settings, data races can occur outside transactions, stressing the ongoing relevance of synchronization. The authors note that the community is starting to create transactional consistency protocols, hinting at parallels with release consistency.

For transactional serialization, they acknowledge that current semantics need refinement, as practical implementations often interleave instructions harmlessly. They propose that verifiable memory model tools should be able to demonstrate execution correctness without serializing.

The authors hope that transactional models are simpler and can scale well, even with strong memory models. They recognize the contributions of colleagues and express gratitude for support received, particularly noting the role of Krste AsanoviÄ‡, the Scalable Synchronization Research Group at Sun Microsystems Laboratories, the Fortress team, and funding from IBM and DARPA's HPCS program.
