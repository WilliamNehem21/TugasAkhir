The recent trend in clustering involves optimizing clusters with advanced optimization techniques. Many new algorithms have emerged, focusing primarily on the objective similar to that of K-means clustering. Researchers have proposed more effective objective functions for clustering, leading to the idea of combining these objectives with optimization algorithms to enhance clustering results. In this context, a new hybrid algorithm called MKF-Cuckoo has been introduced. It combines the Cuckoo Search algorithm with a Multiple Kernel-based Fuzzy C-Means (MKFCM) algorithm, utilizing the MKFCM objective for optimization. Tested on the Iris and Wine datasets, MKF-Cuckoo achieved 96% accuracy on Iris and 67% accuracy on Wine, indicating its effectiveness compared to other algorithms based on metrics like clustering accuracy, Rand coefficient, Jaccard coefficient, and computational time.

With the view that clustering can be reformulated as an optimization problem, many techniques focus on finding optimal centroids by minimizing the sum of squared distances between data objects and centroids. The MKF-Cuckoo algorithm works in three phases: initial solution encoding, defining the objective function for clustering, and the algorithmic procedure for MKF-Cuckoo search. Initial solutions are randomly selected centroids from the dataset, and the objective function incorporates both kernel-based distances and fuzzy membership functions to determine fitness during the optimization process. Hybridizing the Cuckoo Search algorithm, known for its effectiveness in optimization, with the MKFCM algorithm has produced a potent tool for clustering, leveraging MKFCM's advantages in kernel space to better identify data point variances. The study's focus going forward will be to improve the objective function and make enhancements to the Cuckoo Search algorithm for even better clustering outcomes.
