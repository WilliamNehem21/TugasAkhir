This academic text discusses a method of linking types in a formal system to introduce necessity, specifically within the context of checking the admissibility of statements that are valid in an extended system (notated as 't j') within the base system ('t'). This is done through a linking witness constructor named "link." To understand this concept, different server implementations of a module called 'instack' using either lists or arrays of integers are cited as examples. These differing implementations affect the computational value of the initial source code, as the induced links will differ.

The paper indicates that the authors are looking to further enhance the computational relevance of their full calculus, abbreviated as 'jcalc.' They aim to do this by forging a connection with more complex higher-order module systems where signatures can interact with one another. In such systems, linking would fully leverage their proposed type system. Additionally, they mention ongoing work to produce results related to cut-elimination, which is likely a formal proof technique related to the logical consistency and simplification within their system.
