The paper discusses a methodology to enhance student self-preparation in disciplines that foster algorithmic thinking. It highlights the effectiveness of incorporating animations as supplementary material in lectures. The paper also acknowledges the value of a professional virtual learning environment that encompasses these educational resources.

The education approach outlined avoids any specific programming language; instead, students learn about algorithms using a Czech meta-language based on the fundamental commands of the Pascal programming language, known for its educational design.

The instruction process begins with students mastering algorithmic structures that involve single variables. After achieving proficiency in these basic structures, the education progresses to the inclusion of one-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays, revisiting prior concepts while also focusing on array index manipulation.

During classes, students work in small groups to tackle various problems, writing their solutions on paper. Then, representatives from each group present their solutions on a blackboard for peer comparison and discussion. This collaborative method encourages the development of multiple solutions to a problem and provides an opportunity to address and analyze errors when they arise.

The system also includes a discussion tool in the algds course, primarily facilitating student communication. While the tool is available, direct teacher involvement in discussions is minimal due to the regular lectures and lessons that are already addressing students' queries and issues.

In summary, the paper advocates for a student-centered learning approach where animations augment traditional teaching, use of a meta-language aids in learning algorithmic concepts without the complexity of a programming language, and a virtual platform supports the distribution and discussion of educational content.
