The paper describes an energy-efficient method for determining multicast routes in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), which are networks composed of self-powered mobile nodes that communicate wirelessly without a fixed infrastructure. Due to the nodes' limited energy, it's crucial to find multicast routes that consume minimal power and maximize the lifetime of the network.

The paper introduces the Energy-Efficient Lifetime Aware Multicast (EELAM) strategy, which employs an adaptive genetic algorithm to optimize the multicast routing process. By using a tree topology and genetic algorithm principles, EELAM selects routes with maximum residual energy and minimal energy consumption for data transmission. The adaptive genetic algorithm has been designed with a fitness function that aims to improve energy use, battery life, and multicast coverage.

EELAM differs from standard genetic algorithms by using a more advanced strategy for selecting intermediate nodes, which results in less computational overhead. The proposed strategy demonstrates its superiority in experimentally improving route discovery compared to existing methods.

The manuscript also reviews various multicast approaches for MANETs that address different aspects such as power efficiency, bandwidth usage, and scalability. Several models like MIP, S-REMIT, RBIP, G-REMIT, L-REMIT, MLMH, LAM, and MAODV are discussed, each with its own focus on optimizing multicast routes to improve energy consumption and network lifetime.

The adaptive genetic algorithm plays a central role in EELAM, adjusting parameters like crossover and mutation probabilities based on the state of the network population and solution fitness. By combining the genetic algorithm with other optimization methods, the approach seeks to overcome the limitations in achieving the absolute optimum.

Simulations are used to assess the effectiveness of EELAM, utilizing metrics such as packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay, throughput versus mobility, and energy consumption ratio. Compared to other models, EELAM demonstrates better performance and scalability.

Future work includes refining the adaptive genetic algorithm with fuzzy logic to better estimate the fitness of multicast routes. The paper's contribution is in its novel approach to improve multicast routing in MANETs by balancing energy consumption with network longevity.
