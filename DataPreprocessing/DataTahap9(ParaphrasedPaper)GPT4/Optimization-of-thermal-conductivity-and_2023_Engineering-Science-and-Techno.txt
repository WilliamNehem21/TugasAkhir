The academic paper presents a study on optimizing the thermal and mechanical properties of fired clay bricks, focusing on achieving low thermal conductivity (TC) and high compressive strength (CS). To find the best formulations, the authors used a neuro-regression system to craft objective functions for TC and CS, and applied a genetic algorithm to identify pareto-optimal solutions that both minimized TC and maximized CS. 

The global population increase has driven up the demand for energy-efficient building materials, especially in urban areas where more than half of the population resides. Lightweight materials with low thermal conductivity, such as hollow clay bricks and foam concrete, have been identified as effective insulators to minimize heat loss in buildings. The study explores using sustainable raw materials, including waste products such as fly ash and rice husk ash, as pore-forming additives to manufacture bricks with improved insulating properties and decreased environmental impact.

The study's multi-objective optimization approach is unique in that it simultaneously targets multiple properties of the bricks rather than evaluating them against specific standards. The authors conducted a series of experiments to test the effects of adding peanut shell (PNS) wastes to the clay mixture. The process included molding semi-dry mixtures into pellets, which were then fired following a two-stage heat treatment informed by thermogravimetric analysis of the raw materials. A multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) optimized the ratio of PNS additive, firing time, and firing temperature of the fired clay bricks.

The results demonstrated that the use of PNS as a pore-forming additive reduces both TC and CS due to its effect on increasing porosity and bulk density. It was observed that PNS integration at high temperatures contributed elementally similar constituents to the brick matrix, enhancing the formation of vitreous phases and reducing pore size.

Ultimately, the study confirmed the effectiveness of the optimization method by successfully testing proposed brick formulations with the lowest TC. The high accuracy of the predictive models established was crucial for the success of the optimization, allowing for the production of high-strength bricks with low thermal conductivity.
