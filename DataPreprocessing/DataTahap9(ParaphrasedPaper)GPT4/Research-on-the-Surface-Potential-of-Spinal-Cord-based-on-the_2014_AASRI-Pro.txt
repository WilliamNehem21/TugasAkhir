The paper discusses the crucial role of a system within the spinal cord known as central pattern generators (CPGs), which are responsible for generating rhythmic patterns of neural activity that underlie sustained behaviors like walking, breathing, and chewing. These CPGs act as the central control unit for rhythmical movements, and spinal cord interneurons are highlighted for their significant contribution to motion control and sensory processing. Interneurons offer adjustability in the spinal cord network and are key to the rehabilitation of patients with spinal cord injuries (SCI).

The study theorizes that by applying targeted stimulation or sensory input to specific areas of the uninjured CPG loop in the spinal cord, it may be possible to restore rhythmic movement in parts of the body affected by damage. Moreover, the paper suggests that the diversity of neuron placement within the spinal cord leads to various potential distributions on its surface. Understanding the relationship between neuron location and the pattern of potential distribution could enable researchers to pinpoint excitatory neurons in the spinal cord using pre-established patterns of potential distribution.

To investigate this, the researchers constructed a three-dimensional model of the spinal cord and assigned electrical conductivity properties to different tissues. They recognized that the nerve fiber's resistance has a more significant effect than the spinal cord's capacitance, which can be overlooked for this purpose. They determined the conductivity values for gray matter (0.23 S/m) and white matter (0.60 S/m for vertical conductivity, 0.083 S/m for horizontal conductivity). These figures allowed for more precise modeling of electrical behavior within the spinal cord.
