The paper emphasizes the need for a cloud-based communication platform that offers flexibility and convenience for interactions between doctors and patients. It introduces a system that features an instant messaging service using XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol), which is an open standard, aiding in the reduction of time and costs associated with development. Since XMPP operates on a distributed network without a central master server, it allows easy development of new functionalities for the medical system.

Access to the system requires registration, which is a crucial step in ensuring that users have the necessary privileges. Both patients and doctors have to register to create individual records in the system. A particular focus is placed on the verification of doctors' credentials during registration to maintain a high standard of care provided through the system.

The paper also acknowledges financial support from various sources, indicating a broad range of funding that includes granst from academic, governmental, and corporate entities such as program for new century excellent talents in university, major projects for earth observation, strategic research programs of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Gansu Science and Technology programs, central university research funds, Gansu Telecom's Cuiying research fund, and industry support from Google through its research awards and faculty award, in China.
