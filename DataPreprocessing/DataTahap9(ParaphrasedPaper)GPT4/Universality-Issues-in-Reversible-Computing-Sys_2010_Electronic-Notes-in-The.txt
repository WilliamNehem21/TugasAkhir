This study examines the construction of universal computers within the context of reversible computing environments. It explores the topic utilizing reversible Turing machines, reversible logic circuits, and reversible cellular automata frameworks. Despite the reversibility restriction, several minimal reversible systems are demonstrated to possess the ability for universal computation.

Given that reversibility is a fundamental law at the microscopic physical level, it is significant to explore the efficient implementation of universal computers with this attribute, especially as future devices approach the nanoscale. The paper surveys universal computing systems such as reversible Turing machines, reversible logic circuits, and reversible cellular automata, highlighting that basic reversible systems are capable of universal computation. Reversible computing differs markedly from traditional computing, offering new methodologies and concepts for computational advancement.

Reversible logic elements form the building blocks for reversible logic circuits and are defined by bijective mappings. These elements either lack memory, known as reversible logic gates, or contain memory. Early research on reversible gates was undertaken by Petri, followed by more in-depth studies by Toffoli and Fredkin and Toffoli, focusing on their ties to physical reversibility. Among these, the Toffoli and Fredkin gates are especially well-studied and have been established as logically universal.

Fredkin and Toffoli also introduced the billiard ball model (BBM), a reversible model of computing based on an idealized mechanical system of balls and reflectors. In the BBM, balls can interact via elastic collisions, and in the absence of friction, and it has been demonstrated that a Fredkin gate can be implemented within this model.

Traditional cellular automata (CAs) prove challenging when designing reversible cellular automata (RCAs). A few methods for RCA design have been proposed, including CAs with block rules, partitioned CAs (PCAs), and CAs with second-order rules. PCAs are a subset of traditional CAs, where a PCA's local function being one-to-one guarantees that its global function will also be one-to-one. To create an RCA, one needs only to construct a PCA with such a bijective local function.

The feasibility of a universal model was first demonstrated using a 2-state CA with block rules. Imai and Morita later presented a universal 8-state triangular RCA within the PCA framework. Their model, featuring a simple triangular cell, breaks each cell into three two-state parts with a straightforward local function.

In conclusion, the paper shows that reversible systems, despite the strict constraint of reversibility, are capable of performing universal computation. Additionally, these systems can be built from simple components, such as 2-state reversible logic elements or reversible local functions of PCAs, affirming the potential for developing new computing architectures based on reversible principles.
