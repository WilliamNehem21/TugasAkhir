This academic paper discusses a model for computational origami, which includes a set of operations that allow the creation of folds by referencing specific points and lines:

1. Creating a fold along a line through specified points p and q.
2. Creating a fold that aligns points p and q.
3. Creating a fold that aligns two specified lines m and n.
4. Creating a fold perpendicular to a given line m, provided certain conditions are met (e.g., line l passing through a point on a line m).

The paper mentions a formal language designed to describe and reason within this computational model. However, this formal language is not user-friendly for practical origamists looking to apply computational origami methods.

To address this, the authors have developed an environment named EOS that supports origami construction and enables users to understand geometric properties within computational origami. Even though some programming and computational features have been implemented, the paper suggests that further programming support is necessary to fully realize the potential of computational origami.
