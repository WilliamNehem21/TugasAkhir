This paper outlines the collaborative efforts of Sen Chen, Jian Wang, Manting Yan, Chuntao Yang, and Huihui Han in devising a model for combinatorial optimization within complex manufacturing networks. The study emphasizes the integration of human-machine-physical data to facilitate knowledge discovery and enable more effective decision-making.

The authors propose the DOSTAR method, which aims to boost the efficiency of quality traceability in water heater manufacturing. It tackles the challenge of multifaceted data sources, decision-makers, spatial-temporal constraints, and interlinked data by focusing on data fusion, decision-weight analysis, temporal-spatial data governance, and domain ontology.

After a thorough examination of existing literature on combinatorial optimization and various solutions, the paper identifies a gap: most studies don't effectively incorporate key factors into their models or lack a comprehensive model.

Subsequently, the authors explore human-in-the-loop strategies, compound methods, spatiotemporal data governance, and reinforcement learning applications. The paper underscores the complexity of quality traceability in water heaters. It focuses on data collection and the creation of a domain ontology to model the intricate manufacturing environment effectively.

The study concludes with the construction of the DOSTAR fusion model, which meshes big data from several sources and dimensions, utilizing AHP for weighting human-related data and implementing reinforced learning for knowledge discovery. The research illustrates how this methodology can optimize the manufacturing network, suggesting potential improvements and anticipating further expansion of data in subsequent research for more profound knowledge exploration.
