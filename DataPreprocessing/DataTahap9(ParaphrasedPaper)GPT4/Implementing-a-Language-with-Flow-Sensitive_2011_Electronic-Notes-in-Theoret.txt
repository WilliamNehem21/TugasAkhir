Various efforts have been undertaken to reconcile the differences between static and dynamic programming languages. Languages such as Scala, C# 3.0, OCaml, and Java 7 have integrated some sort of local type inference, which serves to minimize the amount of necessary syntax. Transitional typing strategies, including gradual, soft, and hybrid typing, have been developed to allow a mixed approach where parts of a program can be statically typed while other parts remain dynamic.

In languages like Java, the treatment of nullable references as non-nullable has led to significant errors. Proposals to resolve these issues involve static type systems that clearly differentiate between nullable and non-nullable references.

The burden of implementing certain programming constructs, like type testing, is heavier in statically-typed languages. In object-oriented languages, notably Java, developers are required to explicitly retype expressions after instance checks. For instance, testing if an object 's' is an instance of 'Circle' necessitates the introduction of a new 'Circle' typed variable to access the object's 'Circle'-specific features.

The programming language Whiley represents numbers on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) in a way akin to Clojure, using custom classes to represent integers and reals, ensuring they automatically resize to avoid overflow, and treating integers as genuine subtypes of reals.

In Whiley, a variable guaranteed to be a list upon entry will have its type translated to 'List' on the JVM. This precludes direct use of 'instanceof' to identify different list types. A type distinction requires inspecting the list's first element, leading to a true branch only if that element is itself a list.

Similarly, a record type in Whiley is represented as an 'Object[]' upon entry. The 'instanceof' test is unsuitable for distinguishing record types due to this representation. Instead, the presence of specific fields is checked. Field names are stored in a dedicated initial array slot, which is used for field identification.

Within Whiley's compiler, record type distinction is optimized by minimizing field presence checks, only performing those necessary to identify the correct type case.

Information flow analysis concerns the monitoring and control of data flow within a program, often for security purposes. Hunt and Sands adopted a flow-sensitive methodology in their analysis, which didn't consider conditional effects. Russo et al. showed that dynamic systems might reject programs deemed type-safe by Hunt and Sands. JFlow, an extension for Java, was built upon this idea.

Typestate analysis involves flow-sensitive examination of object states to enforce rules about the sequence in which operations are performed on objects, with the goal of maintaining temporal safety properties. Pioneered by Strom and Yellin, it uses finite-state automatons to codify proper API usageâ€”for example, a file must be opened before being read. Fink et al. and Bodden et al. later improved on this concept with flow-sensitive, interprocedural typestate verification and hybrid systems that statically resolve potential errors while dynamically checking as a fallback. These analyses were further refined by incorporating a backward propagation step to enhance precision.
