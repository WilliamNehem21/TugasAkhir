In recent years, there has been a growing significance attached to distributed applications and peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. These types of systems operate in a decentralized fashion and exhibit considerable dynamism, supporting the frequent joining and departure of numerous nodes. A critical task in the majority of P2P systems is the effective retrieval of data items, and ensuring that any given node can be reached within the network is an essential concern.

Academic literature, including seminal works such as the Chord protocol by Stoica et al., generally offers high-level overviews of the correctness of various algorithms without delving into detailed operational semantics. Additionally, traditional model-checking methods struggle to analyze P2P systems due to their dynamic nature and tendency to feature behaviors that could be considered to have an infinite number of states. Hence, a significant challenge lies in determining the appropriate level of abstraction for modeling these algorithms to facilitate effective verification.

When considering how nodes may connect to the network, it's anticipated that they could do so in any sequence. Since the internal configuration of the system is not visible externally, a primary challenge emerges in defining the behavior of a network arranged in a ring structure. To address this, we suggest the incorporation of a token ring protocol over the existing Chord protocol. This additional protocol involves an abstract token that circulates in a clockwise direction around the ring, providing a new level of abstraction to assist in specifying and verifying system behavior.
