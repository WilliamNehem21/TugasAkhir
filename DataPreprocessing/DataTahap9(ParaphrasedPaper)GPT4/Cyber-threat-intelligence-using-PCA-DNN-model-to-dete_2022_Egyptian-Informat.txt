The central challenge in computer science is ensuring data security and protecting users from cyber threats and hostile activities. While methods such as multifactor authentication and secure system design offer some protection, they fall short in detecting certain types of attacks, like zero-day exploits, and in preserving data for forensic analysis. Common security tools include firewalls, encryption, and intrusion detection systems; however, two key issues persist with these measures:

1. They may not address the full spectrum of potential attacks.
2. They often lack specifics for the configuration of models, data processing, and system optimization, leading to problems like overfitting.

Researchers have evaluated the effectiveness of various AI techniques, such as neural networks, support vector machines, and the DT-J48 algorithm, utilizing the well-known KDD Cup data set. DT-J48 was found to have superior performance metricsâ€”detection rate, false alarm rate, and overall accuracy.

Another study using the Weka tool examined different approaches, such as rule-based and tree-based methods, with and without feature reduction on the KDD Cup 1999 dataset, demonstrating that classification methods could be effective with fewer features. However, the research was limited by dataset size.

The limitations of other algorithms include not addressing several attack types, failing to mention the number of input features, and lack of clarity in the optimization and preprocessing stages, such as data normalization and handling missing values, which may cause overfitting.

This paper introduces a hybrid approach that uses deep neural networks, principal component analysis, and statistical measures to improve attack detection, specifically focusing on stealth attacks within network traffic.

New datasets, such as the CSE-CIC-IDS2018 provided by the Canadian Institute of Cybersecurity, offer modern traffic patterns and comprehensive intrusion scenarios. These datasets are used to create more accurate test environments and contain real network behavior profiles, including various protocols and interaction scenarios, to simulate network activity realistically.

The network testbed described is a realistic architecture containing 500 machines across five LANs with different Microsoft and Linux operating systems and servers. Although this setup simulates various attack scenarios, it comes with limitations, such as unnamed network packets and unusable flow data due to infinity or NaN values.

An anomaly detection system is proposed that leverages flow-level network traffic analysis to capture attacks, combining various techniques for improved performance. Data collection is often in PCAP format, expensive in terms of storage. Therefore, preprocessing steps aim to clean and convert the data for effective machine learning model training.

The paper addresses the differences in available features among datasets, emphasizing the increased feature set in more recent datasets used with the CICFlowMeter tool.

Finally, the study compares a deep neural network's performance with and without applying PCA for dimensionality reduction on the CSE-CIC-IDS2018 dataset. Efficiency of the model training and classification was also considered, showing potential for cost-saving practices by reducing feature sets without significantly impacting model performance.
