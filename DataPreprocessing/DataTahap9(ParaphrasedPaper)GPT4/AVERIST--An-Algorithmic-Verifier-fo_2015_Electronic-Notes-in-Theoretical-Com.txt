The academic paper describes a process where movement from the positive x-axis through the first quadrant to the positive y-axis is considered. Every directional change is associated with a numerical weight, representing maximum expansion. Specifically, if a movement begins at a distance d from the origin on the x-axis, it can reach a maximum distance of 2d on the y-axis, which is denoted as the weight of the transition.

The paper also discusses the preliminary step of quantitative predicate abstraction, which involves dividing the state-space into distinct sections based on a limited collection of linear expressions. The nodes of the resultant abstract representation directly relate to the borders of these divided areas.

The implementation details of "Averist," a Python program, are then explained. It employs the Parma Polyhedra Library (PPL) to handle the invariant conditions and transition guards of the polyhedral switched system and to execute polyhedral operations needed for partitioning the state-space. Additionally, the GNU Linear Programming Kit (GLPK) is utilized to resolve optimization challenges that arise during the calculation of weights. For graph-related tasks and in the model-checking phase, Averist harnesses the NetworkX package. These tools are incorporated into Sage, a comprehensive, free, and open-source mathematical software platform.
