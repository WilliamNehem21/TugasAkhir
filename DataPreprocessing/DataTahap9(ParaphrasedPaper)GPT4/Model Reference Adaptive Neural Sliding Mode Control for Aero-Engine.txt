This paper discusses the design of a sophisticated controller for aero-engines that can handle the extensive variability in flight conditions. Due to the dynamic nature of flight, a control system must cope with parameter changes, disturbances, and variations in external conditions. The researchers have developed an innovative neural network sliding mode variable structure decoupling controller, which is enhanced with model reference adaptive control principles, specifically tailored for aero-engine management.

By integrating a Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network with sliding mode control, the system uses the neural network's output to drive the control process while the sliding mode's switching function acts as the stimulus for the neural network. The adaptive element comes in as the neural network adjusts its weights based on the difference between the reference model's target output and the engine's actual output. Simulations indicate that this Model Reference Adaptive Neural Sliding Mode Controller (MRANBSMC) performs effectively throughout the entire range of flight conditions. It successfully mitigates the chattering issue often associated with sliding mode control, provides good decoupling capability, demonstrates robustness against disturbances and parameter variations, and maintains satisfactory control tracking quality.

The novel combination of neural network and sliding mode control (SMC) presented in this paper eliminates the 'reachable stage', which is typically vulnerable to disturbances and parameter changes, by ensuring the system remains in the 'sliding stage' right from the start. This is accomplished by the neural network, which augments sliding mode control by automatically compensating for any deviations, allowing the system to converge back to the sliding surface in the presence of perturbations or disturbances. As a result, the system maintains its robustness while reducing or eliminating chattering.

For the sliding mode control system to perform as intended, the chosen reference model must satisfy two criteriaâ€”it must reflect the desired performance indices and should closely match the system to be controlled. Moreover, the paper addresses the need for a decoupled control system in the presence of dual-variable control systems that might introduce coupling effects. The suitable reference model used herein is derived through state feedback decoupling and pole assignment techniques as applied to the engine model.

Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed controller can effectively decouple control channels such as the low-pressure rotor and turbine rear total temperature in the aero-engine. Even in the face of disturbances and parameter changes, the control system's response remains nearly unaffected. This approach produces satisfactory outcomes across all flight conditions, indicating the robustness and anti-jamming capabilities of the control system, along with commendable accuracy in both static and dynamic control functions. In summary, this controller not only strengthens the robustness of the overall system but also addresses the common problem of chattering in sliding-mode control, leading to better control convergence.
