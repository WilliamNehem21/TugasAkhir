This academic paper explores an optimal portfolio model with cardinality constraints, where minimizing the value-at-risk (VaR) serves as the goal. The research presents a mixed differential evolution algorithm as a method to solve the model and utilizes a case study comprising sixteen diverse stocks from the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets. The numerical outcomes indicate both the model's validity and the algorithm's efficacy.

Since the 1970s, financial risk has risen alongside economic globalization, rapid advancements in information technology, and financial system innovation. Controlling financial risks is now a primary concern for both regulators and investors, making risk measurement a critical research area.

The study employs a differential evolution algorithm to address the problem, achieving credible results that confirm the solution's practicality. The findings reinforce the soundness of the model and the effectiveness of the hybrid algorithm, demonstrating that the paper presents a viable method for optimizing portfolios with cardinality constraints.

If the number of non-zero elements in a trial solution does not fall within the specified range (k1 to k2), a new trial is generated according to the earlier defined steps. The process proceeds until the trial's element values lie between the lower and upper bounds (l and u).

The paper further illustrates that as the return threshold increases, so does the value-at-risk, adhering to the principle of higher risk equating to higher potential returns. It also points out that concentrating investments in just a few stocks contradicts the principle of diversification, potentially leading to greater risk losses.
