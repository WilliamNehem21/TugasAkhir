In the academic paper, the authors discuss a method for composing classes in a programming language, which allows for creating modular code that isn't self-contained and depends on the integration of other code fragments. This approach uses composition operators to merge these fragments, thereby enabling the creation of various behaviors. Well-known concepts like inheritance, mixins, and traits are examples of class composition methods and form a composition language in this context.

The paper is structured with an informal introduction to the approach using examples, formalization of a simple class composition language, and a summary of contributions with future work considerations. It also contains a proof of soundness in the appendix.

The article introduces a meta-programming language designed for class composition, where a class declaration links a name to a class expression, with the simplest expression being a base class encompassing fields and methods. It discusses rules for subtyping and method lookup, emphasizing precedence and supporting direct subtyping among multiple classes.

Meta-reduction, a safe, context-dependent step enforced after successful typechecking, is also described. Typed metaexpressions are marked as code if typechecking is successful; otherwise, errors can arise if no further typechecking is possible.

Compile-time execution is vital to ensure class type correctness and to preclude errors, such as misidentified methods. The study focuses on a meta-circular compile-time execution approach, comparing it to other meta-programming models that either use a separate meta-language or perform code generation at different stages, like runtime or compile-time.

OpenJava's similarities to the presented work are highlighted, where programmers can augment Java with new constructs and guide the OpenJava compiler on converting these into standard Java code using a reflection-based protocol. However, the authors clarify that their goal is not to extend or modify an existing language arbitrarily but to let programmers develop their own composition operators within a fixed syntax and semantics.

Finally, the paper compares the presented method with dynamically typed languages, which often allow meta-programming through facilities like an eval function. Groovy, in particular, supports compile-time meta-programming with custom AST transformations, providing more sophisticated control over the generation of executable bytecode from source code.
