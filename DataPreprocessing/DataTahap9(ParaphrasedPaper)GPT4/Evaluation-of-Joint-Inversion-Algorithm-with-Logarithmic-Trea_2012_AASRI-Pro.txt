The paper discusses the significance of utilizing borehole electrical logging techniques for accurately determining the true formation resistivity and estimating the initial saturation of hydrocarbons in oil and gas exploration. It points out that a joint inversion algorithm can enhance the interpretation of logging data and the evaluation of reserves. However, since the available electrical logging data is nonlinear and limited, there are no unique solutions to the inversion problem, and any results obtained are approximations or estimates of the true values.


In such inversion problems, the actual parameters of the reservoir are typically unknown. Therefore, beyond using prior information as a constraint, it is crucial to assess the quality of the inversion algorithm itself. This often involves testing the method's reliability and efficiency on synthetic formations. The nonlinearity of electric logging inversion problems can be transformed into linear problems using suitable methods, allowing the application of linear inversion theory assessment criteria.


The paper then focuses on the evaluation of the joint inversion algorithm's stability and convergence. It uses dual-induction and dual laterolog devices in this context, applying matrices such as the data-resolution and model-resolution matrices, as well as the condition number derived from linear inversion theory.


The formation of interest includes the borehole, an invasion zone, and the undisturbed formation, characterized by three parameters: true-formation resistivity (Rt), resistivity of the invasion zone (Rxo), and invasion depth (Ri). A dual induction logging instrument provides deep and medium induction logging values, while a dual laterolog device gives deep and shallow lateral logging values. Logging with both tools simultaneously provides four data points that can be used to invert for the three formation parameters.


An iterative process is employed where increments in the model parameters are solved, updated, and used to calculate logging responses and errors, with the process repeating until convergence criteria are met. The paper uses specific notation where the superscripts 'm' and 's' indicate measurement and simulation results, respectively, and the subscript numbers represent specific logging data responses: R1 (deep induction), R2 (medium induction), R3 (deep laterolog), and R4 (shallow laterolog).
