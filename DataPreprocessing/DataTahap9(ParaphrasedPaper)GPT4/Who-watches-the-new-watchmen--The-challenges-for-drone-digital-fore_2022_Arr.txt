Improvements in drone technology have significantly enhanced the functionality of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), establishing them as an important tool in contemporary society. However, with the anticipated increase in drone usage comes a rise in the likelihood of both accidental and intentional security breaches. It is critical to perform forensic analysis on such incidents, particularly because drones are frequently operated over populated areas and can be used for harmful purposes by extremists or criminals. There is an urgent need to develop a comprehensive framework for drone digital forensic investigations that standardizes evidence collection and analysis procedures.

This academic paper is organized as follows: First, an overview of drone technology and relevant forensic tools is provided, followed by a discussion of potential evidence sources on drones and the challenges forensic investigators may face, accompanied by a guide of prioritized evidence for different scenarios. After introducing existing forensic models and standards, the paper highlights the current gap in dealing with the unique challenges presented by drones. The paper concludes by emphasizing the importance of addressing these issues for the future development of drone forensics.

The flight controller, which includes sensors such as accelerometers and gyroscopes for autonomous flight, is identified as a key component for evidence gathering. Other devices within a UAV system with storage capabilities can also offer valuable forensic data, even if some parts are damaged or inaccessible due to anti-forensic measures like encryption.

The investigation of malicious physical actions, both targeting drones and executed using drones, is considered. Forensic investigators must first determine the nature of the incident and assess the collected evidence, including any visible damage.

Standards play an essential role in maintaining consistency in forensic procedures. However, existing standards from organizations such as ETSI, NIST, and SWGDE do not specifically address drone forensics, leaving gaps in guidance for accessing data and handling discrepancies in log files between the drone and the ground control station (GCS). The credibility of command authentications is weakened by the absence of encryption in many commercial drones, complicating the ability to determine the source of commands.

Given the absence of standardized drone forensic procedures, researchers rely on best practices applicable to similar devices. Drones share many hardware and sensor characteristics with mobile phones, yet there is no standard practice for mobile forensic investigations, although efforts are underway to establish one.

The growing use of UAVs across various sectors is expected to lead to a surge in drones populating the skies, resulting in inevitable instances where digital forensic investigations of drones will become routine. However, the unique physical attributes, mobility, and dual-control aspects of UAVs present complicated challenges not covered by current standards, increasing the complexity of these investigations.
