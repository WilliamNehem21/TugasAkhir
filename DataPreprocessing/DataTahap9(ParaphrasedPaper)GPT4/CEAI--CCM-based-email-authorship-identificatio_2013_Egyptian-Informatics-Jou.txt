Computer-mediated communication (CMC), particularly through emails, has become a predominant form of written interaction, utilized for various purposes and spanning formal to informal content. In the digital age, emails have played a crucial role in communication but have also been exploited in criminal activities, such as the 2008 Mumbai attacks, where email evidence was found to implicate the perpetrators. Consequently, it has become essential to develop systems capable of tracing the identity of individuals who might use computers to facilitate crimes.

The paper discusses a specific area of computer forensics: email authorship identification (EAI). In this context, the goal is to match an email (e) with its original author (a) by establishing a relationship (EAI(f,e,a)) based on a feature set (f) that is unique to each author within a dataset. A training model is built using these features, which is then used to determine the most probable author of a test email by measuring the similarity of features.

Authorship analysis techniques can be categorized into identification of authors, characterization of writing style, and detection of similarities between texts. The history of authorship analysis traces back to early studies comparing literary works and identifying authors of contested documents, such as the Federalist Papers. These investigations utilized stylometric features, which are distinctive elements of writing style, and became integral to understanding authorship across various texts, including emails.

Recent advances in the field are surveyed, highlighting the role of such features and the effectiveness of various authorship attribution methods. Experiments have demonstrated high accuracy in identifying authors through machine learning algorithms like support vector machines (SVMs), decision trees, and neural networks, though the size of the datasets sometimes limits the studies' scope and generalizability. Features like sentence length and vocabulary richness continue to be valuable for EAI tasks.

The paper describes several algorithms to extract features from emails, such as the last punctuation mark, and investigates the impact of combining different feature types on the accuracy of authorship identification. The study also utilizes cross-validation methods to measure the effectiveness of proposed techniques, ensuring each email is tested rigorously.

Overall, the research emphasizes the importance of developing robust methods for email authorship identification to counteract the malicious use of digital communication by criminals, thus contributing to advances in software forensics.
