Process algebras provide a sophisticated means to model diverse systems, ranging from computer networks to biological entities. By incorporating (stochastic) rates of actions, these models extend into the domain of Stochastic Process Algebras (SPA), which are widely used for evaluating performance and for modeling in systems biology. SPAs are fundamentally grounded in the semantics of Continuous-Time Markov Chains (CTMCs), essentially serving as a higher-level language for CTMC representation. Consequently, analytical methods applicable to CTMCs, including steady-state and transient analyses, can also be employed for SPAs. Additionally, certain properties of CTMCs, such as block decomposability, can be adapted for use at the SPA level, substantially easing the analysis process. Nevertheless, the computational cost of analyzing stochastic systems remains high, with the complexity exacerbated by the state space explosion problem, particularly when numerous identical components, like molecules in chemical reactions, are involved.
