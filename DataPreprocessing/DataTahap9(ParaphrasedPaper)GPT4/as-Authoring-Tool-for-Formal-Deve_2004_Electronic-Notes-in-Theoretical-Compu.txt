This academic paper discusses the challenges and solutions for integrating formal mathematical development with LaTeX document preparation. The traditional method of copying and pasting formal components into LaTeX can introduce errors and is insufficient. To enhance quality, visualization and user experience, the tool must support automatic importing of source code from proof assistants to maintain correctness and preserve connections between the proof scripts and the presented documentation.

The tool should not be limited to a single theorem prover, although initially it is illustrated using Coq syntax examples. Users should be able to edit imported elements to improve readability without introducing errors into the formal development.

The proposed solution should allow users to enrich their formal developments with explanatory documentation. LaTeX is a suitable export format for scientific documents, but it fails to maintain the structure inherent in formal scripts like Coq, where commands are active and comments contain documentation. To overcome this, the paper suggests using TeXmacs, an editor that handles structured documents and can save them in a format that facilitates machine-driven searches.

The paper also describes the special handling of certain nodes in the Coq output, like binder lists and extendible notation commands. An automatic documentation tool generates TeXmacs files from the Coq standard library, creating a browsable online resource similar to web documentation.

To maintain documentation during the incorporation process, the paper discusses modifying the Coq lexer to recognize comments selectively. This ensures that documentation fragments are neither ignored nor misplaced. The export process is split into two steps to manage the complexity and allow user customization.

Finally, the paper reviews Coq-tex, a tool that processes Coq commands in LaTeX files, differentiating between showing the command, its result, or both, according to user-defined tags.

Overall, the article aims to provide a robust documentation tool that seamlessly integrates formal mathematical developments with user-friendly, structured document preparation while ensuring the accuracy and structural integrity of the proofs.
