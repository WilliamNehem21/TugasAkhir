The proliferation of data management tasks has necessitated the advent of automation, with computers and specialized software greatly assisting in activities such as editing, storage, publishing, retrieval, and other computational functions. Currently, computers are utilized at every stage of textual composition, rendering the traditional pen and paper methods non-essential. A question arises: can a similar paradigm shift occur in mathematical work, permitting mathematicians to fully rely on computers from the genesis of their work to its completion?

The central challenge lies in developing an automated system capable of handling computations in the mathematical language "MathLang," designed with a complete symbolic set for ease of manipulation by computers.

When using existing formal languages to write mathematics, there are constraints imposed by the underlying logic of the language, limiting its expressiveness. To encompass the entirety of mathematics, MathLang is structured to express the layout of mathematical texts and the reasoning within.

The ability of MV and WTT language structures to encode mathematics at all levels was tested by applying them to the "Foundations of Analysis" by E. Landau, a book that was already fully formalized in the AutoMath language by Bert van Benthem Jutting. The goal was not to create a full formalization immediately but to encode the work in a way that allows for later formalization. This approach is chosen to facilitate future comparisons between the existing formalization and any that might be developed on top of our encoding.

This paper details the necessary extensions to WTT to faithfully encode the first chapter of Landau's book, preserving the language elements such as flags, case definitions, blocks, and references. MathLang is presented using an experimental syntax to be refined, with its current syntax supported by XML to enable data transformations, including the automatic rendering displayed in this paper.

Specifically, MathLang allows for variable declaration via four constructions, case-based definitions without the need for added constants, and local constant definitions restricted to specific blocks of the text, reflecting parts of theorems and proofs.

Rules within MathLang assign types to expressions and ensure context coherence, with some rules dedicated to constructing well-formed blocks. A MathLang type-checker program has been implemented, using Camlp4 for parsing and OCaml for type inference, to confirm the validity of MathLang documents.

As MathLang evolves, its development is guided by the transcription of existing mathematical texts into its framework, maintaining faithfulness to its syntax without resorting to syntactic sugar. Extensions such as references and block information extraction will proceed in tandem with translation efforts.

The envisioned MathLang environment will require a specialized editor, designed to be user-friendly, visually represent mathematical symbols, and provide immediate type analysis feedback to the mathematician.

Y. Baba and M. Suzuki have introduced a grammatical analyzer that can expand its rules dynamically, learning from translated sentences to recognize similar patterns throughout the text, exemplifying the adaptive capabilities hoped for in MathLang's ongoing development.
