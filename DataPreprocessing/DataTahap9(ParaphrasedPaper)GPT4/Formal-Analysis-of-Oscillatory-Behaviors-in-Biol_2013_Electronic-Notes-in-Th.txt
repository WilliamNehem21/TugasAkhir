Cells are dynamic environments composed of intricate networks involving protein activities, gene functions, and regulatory molecules working in concert to execute organismal functions. Genes encode proteins and regulate their production through the roles of transcription and translation. During this process, certain proteins serve to regulate gene expression by switching genes on or off, thereby creating biological regulatory networks (BRNs). These networks often include feedback loops that help maintain protein levels within a cell, although these loops make it challenging to predict BRN behavior. Studying these dynamics is crucial for understanding how certain cellular changes can lead to diseases such as cancer, exemplified by the oscillatory nature of the p53-MDM2 feedback loop and its role in cancer development.

Representing BRNs as directed graphs or logical circuits is a common technique to analyze their behavior, but this method struggles with complexity when numerous biological components are intertwined.

Recently, BRNs have been conceptualized as concurrent systems, opening the door to using formal verification techniques in systems biology. Bernot and colleagues have pioneered this approach, implementing formal methods to model BRNs as interacting biological entities within a concurrent framework using a BDD-based functional model checker called SMV. They described biological properties using computational tree logic (CTL) and showcased their methods by examining mucus production in the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
