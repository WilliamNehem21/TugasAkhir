The primary author has played a pivotal role in pioneering nominal techniques, which include nominal logic as referenced in literature [22,14]. These methods share commonalities with a-logic and introduce a uniqueness property known as the "freshness predicate." Nonetheless, they diverge from the axiom of choice. For instance, nominal logic cannot reconcile with a unary operation 'f' that creates a contradiction such as (f s) not equal to s for any s. It appears possible, however, to formulate such a function 'f' within the framework of a-logic.

When it comes to the semantics of these logics, predicates are considered as sets containing (tuples of) domain elements. 'At' is specifically a unary predicate. Atoms are distinguished by being a specific subset within the domain, denoted by [[at]], which represents the interpretation of 'at' in that domain. Elements found in [[at]] have a unique property; they must not appear in the range of any term-formers' interpretations.
