This academic paper emphasizes that Theorem 2.2 pertains to any form of natural isomorphism, and not just the standard natural transformation derived from limits. The theorem confirms that if a natural isomorphism exists, the standard natural transformation must also be a natural isomorphism.

Further, as indicated by Theorem 4.9, the composition of profunctors, a type of mapping labeled as "jf," maintains colimits when viewed as a function of "f" and similarly when acting as a function of "j." This finding is significant for representing nondeterministic systems using presheaves, which are a kind of profunctor from a simple category with one object and one arrow. This composition property is crucial because it ensures that horizontal combination of 2-cells within the bicategory of profunctors upholds the properties of open maps and open-map bisimulation, which are important in the analysis of nondeterministic systems.

The paper acknowledges Martin Hyland for the inspiration derived from his lectures on category theory at Cambridge in the fall of 1995, which highlighted the concepts of ends and coends. The authors note that while the results of their paper seem to be widely recognized in the field, they were not found explicitly in existing literature. The aim of their publication is to formally document these results and demonstrate their applicability. Additionally, the authors express their gratitude to BRICS, Aarhus, where the foundations for their work were laid.
