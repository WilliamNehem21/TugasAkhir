This academic paper presents a visual reasoning tool that helps users create and engage with spider diagrams, which are visual representations utilized to express logical statements. The tool operates on a complete and sound system of spider diagrams, enabling the construction of logical proofs. It contains an algorithm that checks if one diagram implies another and either generates a proof of entailment or produces a counterexample when no entailing relationship exists. This tool also forms a foundation for similar reasoning with more complex constraint diagrams. The paper outlines how regions, spiders, and shading within spider diagrams correspond to set-theoretic concepts, and informal reasoning rules are provided for transforming these diagrams. The implementation flattens nested structures for simplicity and treats the components of compound diagrams without a strict order, eschewing associative and commutative rules. The paper concludes by highlighting the utility of the tool in efficient proof construction, offering valid rule applications at each step of proof construction.
