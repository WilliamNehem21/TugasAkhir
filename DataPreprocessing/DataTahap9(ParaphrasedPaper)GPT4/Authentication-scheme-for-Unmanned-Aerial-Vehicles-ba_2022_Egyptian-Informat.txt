The academic paper discusses the evolving fields of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), which aim to provide rapid and efficient data communication services to ground-based users. Despite their advantages, the openness of these networks introduces significant security and privacy challenges, including various types of jamming attacks that threaten the integrity and authenticity of communications.

To address these issues, existing solutions focus on ensuring data integrity, authenticating messages, and eliminating extraneous authentications. Nevertheless, these approaches often fall short in terms of computational efficiency and comprehensive security coverage. The paper introduces a novel Efficient Authentication Scheme for Safety Applications in Internet of Vehicles (EASSAIV), designed to enhance message authentication by collecting, processing, and verifying information sent to roadside units, UAVs, or vehicles.

The paper is structured as follows:

1. Section 2 reviews related research.
2. Section 3 details the proposed EASSAIV mechanism, including its security model and authentication protocol.
3. Section 4 presents the analysis and results.
4. The final section concludes the paper and suggests future research directions.

The paper also describes various other proposals, including:
- A Secure Authentication Scheme for VANETs with Batch Verification (SAS-VANET).
- A Privacy-Preserving Sensory Data Sharing Scheme for IoV networks addressing location privacy concerns.
- An Enhanced Anonymity Resilience Security Protocol for vehicular ad hoc networks.

The proposed EASSAIV mechanism leverages asymmetric encryption for secure data exchange, unfolding in three phases (initial deployment, implementation, operational). It uses timestamps and nonces to prevent replay attacks and proceeds through several nonce exchanges to establish mutual authentication between vehicles.

Formal validation is conducted with the AVISPA tool, which employs HLPSL for modelling. The proposed protocol ensures secrecy and integrity of communications and is found to be robust against a variety of security attacks.

In conclusion, the EASSAIV scheme offers improved performance and security in IoV networks over current methods. Future research will aim to further adapt these security mechanisms for specific contexts like highways, where vehicle distance poses additional challenges to authentication processes.
