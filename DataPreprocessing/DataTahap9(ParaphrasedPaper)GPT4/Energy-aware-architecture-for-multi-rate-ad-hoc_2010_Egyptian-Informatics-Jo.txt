The essence of ad hoc network design centers on addressing limitations in energy efficiency and bandwidth resources. Proposed strategies for improving these networks often involve multi-rate adaptation architectures, which aim to reduce control overhead and enhance bandwidth efficiency. Our study introduces an advanced multi-rate protocol designed to optimize network performance with minimal control overhead. Thorough testing through the QualNet network simulator has confirmed that our auto multi-rate protocol substantially boosts overall network efficiency.

Our proposed method optimizes network throughput and bandwidth use in ad hoc networks by incorporating a multi-rate algorithm paired with a power-saving protocol. Through various sections, this paper delves into multi-rate approaches, details the power-saving protocol for mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), reviews related literature, evaluates the performance of our protocol, and outlines the simulation results. In concluding, we highlight key findings.

The paper's primary concept involves enabling wireless stations to select the most energy-effective transmission method based on the link quality with their respective receivers. This decision incorporates elements like transmission rate, power level, and data payload size. Given the variable distances between stations in a typical 802.11 MANET, the ensuing wireless channel conditions differ, prompting stations to adopt varied strategies to communicate with nearby neighbors.

We propose three power-saving protocols, where power-save (PS) hosts segment their time into fixed-length beacon intervals. Each interval contains a subinterval for Ad hoc Traffic Indication Message (ATIM), during which PS hosts activate their receivers to listen for and potentially act on incoming packets. If a PS host has data to transmit during the ATIM window, it competes to send an ATIM frame to a neighbor. Otherwise, the PS host sends periodic beacon frames to maintain network synchronization. Outside of the ATIM interval, a PS host without data to transmit or receive may enter sleep mode.

We utilized constant bit rate sources for testing, generating 512-byte packets at a frequency of 10 packets per second for 100 seconds, selecting random destinations. The network employed Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector routing, and the MAC and physical wireless parameters were adjusted to fit those of the Cisco Aironet 802.11a/b/g wireless cardbus adapter.
