The academic paper discusses challenges and solutions in modeling and simulating large-scale complex systems, which require multidisciplinary knowledge and use different modeling languages and methods. It notes that due to the heterogeneity and hierarchical structure of the simulation systems, design and execution control of simulations are difficult. To address this, the authors introduce a hierarchical modeling method, a synchronous control algorithm based on an array of synchronization points, and a collaborative simulation framework built upon a distributed computing environment. The framework enhances hierarchical modeling support and can improve simulation performance as the computing load increases relative to the communication load.

Despite some simulation tools handling analysis and evaluation of single-domain systems, there is a lack of support for multidomain complex system simulation. Combining models from different domains such as hydraulics, aerodynamics, and mechanical control is necessary for cohesive simulations. These models are typically created by domain experts using varied tools and then assembled hierarchically. The paper's framework contributes to this process by providing a distributed environment for development, debugging, and packaging, ensuring fine-grained and reliable models.

The authors describe a synchronization mechanism where simulation loop branches are coordinated at predefined times to maintain consistency. To validate the performance of the framework, they conduct experiments by distributing computing models across computer nodes in a distributed network. The evaluation considers various ratios of computing load to communication load, showing that increasing the proportion of computing load enhances the systemâ€™s parallelism and performance.

The paper is structured to detail the collaborative simulation framework, provide an analysis with experiments, and conclude with future work considerations. The collaboration framework addresses the needs of complex system simulations across multiple disciplines by ensuring data sharing and maintaining efficiency, presenting it as a viable approach for handling the complexities of interdisciplinary simulations.
