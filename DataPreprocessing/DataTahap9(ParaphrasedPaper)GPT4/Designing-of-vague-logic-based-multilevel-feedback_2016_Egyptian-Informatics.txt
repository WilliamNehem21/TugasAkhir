The academic paper examines the limitations of traditional multilevel feedback queue (MLFQ) schedulers, including issues like starvation of prolonged tasks, a fixed quantity of queues, and unchanging time quantum lengths in each queue. These aspects hamper scheduler performance, and inaccuracies in task attributes can exacerbate the problem. To address these issues, the authors propose an enhanced MLFQ scheduler utilizing vague set theory, which they refer to as the Vague Multilevel Feedback Queue (VMLFQ) scheduler.

The VMLFQ scheduler aims to overcome the shortcomings of traditional MLFQ by dynamically determining the optimal number of queues and the appropriate time quantum size for each, thereby also mitigating the starvation issue. The paper demonstrates the VMLFQ scheduler's better performance through MATLAB simulations, especially in terms of average waiting, turnaround time, normalized turnaround time, and response time.

The text outlines the structure of the paper, which includes a background on task scheduling algorithms, MLFQ scheduling, and vague set theory. It also presents VMLFQ in detail and shares simulation results. The authors highlight how MLFQ scheduling has evolved since its introduction in 1962, discussing various improvements and addressing starvation for CPU-bound tasks in low-priority queues.

The fuzzy set, which assigns membership values between 0 and 1 to elements without differentiating between evidence for and against, is superseded by vague set theory that distinguishes both types of evidence. The VMLFQ employs vague set theory to enhance decision-making under uncertainty.

Finally, the paper concludes by emphasizing the VMLFQ scheduler's superior performance compared to conventional MLFQ and probabilistic MLFQ (PMLFQ), attributing this to its runtime flexibility, accuracy in handling task attributes, and reduction of starvation, altogether improving various performance metrics.
