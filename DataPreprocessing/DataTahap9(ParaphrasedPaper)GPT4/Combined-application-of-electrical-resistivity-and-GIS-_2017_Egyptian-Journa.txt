The electrical resistivity method is a widely employed geophysical technique for detecting groundwater by providing insights into underground structures and rock types. Vertical electrical sounding (VES) is particularly useful for mapping shallow subsurface layers.

The study area's subsurface is characterized by three geoelectrical units. The uppermost layer consists of contemporary wadi sediments with varying thicknesses from 5.9 to 27 meters and resistivity measurements between 304 and 1333 ohm.m. Below this lies a layer of sandstone from the Moghra Formation, spanning the same depth range but with lower resistivity values between 33 and 72 ohm.m. This sandstone formation serves as the primary aquifer.

Two speculative faults influence the area's structure. The first fault (F1) is situated southwest of VES point 10 and dips toward the northeast, whereas the second fault (F2) is near VES point 4, with its dip oriented towards the southwest. Together, these faults create a horst structure, indicating that the center of the aquifer lies at a shallower depth.

The pseudo-section further suggests the influence of two faults on the central part of the area. The geoelectrical profile reveals that the upper layer of wadi deposits has a thickness that ranges from 7.2 to 34.6 meters, with resistivity values between 248 and 1378 ohm.m. Notably, the thickness of this layer increases from the northeast towards the southwest.

The structural analysis presents two additional possible faults. The first (F1) is located southwest of VES site 12, with its descending side facing northeast, and the second (F2) is near VES site 6, descending towards the southwest, together forming another horst structure.
