The paper discusses the significant challenge posed by genetic diseases, which stem from the inheritance of abnormal genes across generations, potentially leading to compromised health and societal contributions of affected individuals. These diseases arise from mutations in the genetic code (DNA) that may occur due to complex interactions between multiple genes and environmental factors.

This study aims to identify the interactions between genes, as well as between genes and environmental factors, that contribute to genetic diseases. The proposed approach integrates filter and wrapper feature selection methods to achieve this goal. The filter method employs a Relief algorithm to pinpoint gene-environment interactions, while the wrapper method uses a genetic algorithm to identify gene-gene interactions. Furthermore, a classification decision tree algorithm is involved to create conditional rules for gene-gene interactions.

Several classifier models were tested on four benchmark databases for evaluation purposes, and the proposed method's performance was compared to that of the Apriori algorithm, which is also used for deducing rules of gene-gene interactions. The results show that the proposed approach yielded superior classification accuracy across all databases that incorporated data on gene-environment and gene-gene interactions.

In the quest to understand mutagenic changes, machine learning techniques have been divided into those focused on finding gene subsets linked to gene-environment interactions, and those involved in optimizing gene selection processes. Several novel computational models and algorithms are introduced to enhance the detection of influential gene subsets. These include an artificial bee colony approach combined with independent component analysis, a recursive memetic algorithm, a bimodal unsupervised dimension reduction algorithm, a Markov blanket-embedded genetic algorithm, and a hybrid teaching learning-based optimization and simulated annealing algorithm with support from a support vector machine for cancer detection.

A k-means clustering algorithm is also discussed as an efficient method for data discretization, taking actual gene value distributions into account, rather than using assumed values for setting discretization boundaries.

The paper further describes the process of data preprocessing on four databases to eliminate outliers and missing data, preparing the data for analysis. The refined data is then discretized to suit the analysis methodology. The methodology's performance is assessed using a 5-fold cross-validation technique across training and testing datasets. Predictive accuracy is gauged using the accuracy metric, with attention also given to the number of incorrectly classified samples, indicating the need for improved models for complex disease detection.

Notably, the results show varying accuracies across different databases, which the paper attributes to the unique data characteristics of each database. The limited number of genes present in existing genetic databases compared to the vast number of genes within DNA is a challenge. To improve accuracy, it's imperative to have access to genetic databases containing more gene variants to fully understand the intricacies of gene interactions and the myriad potential causes of genetic diseases.
