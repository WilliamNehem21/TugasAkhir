The study presents and assesses a novel software tool that uses the Taguchi methods for optimization. The research includes two phases of trials utilizing this method. The first phase identifies key controlling factors and their best region of operation, while the second phase narrows down the experiment to these important factors to determine their optimal combination. The tool was tested by examining the best conditions for a cutting tool's cooling system. The results from the investigation led to two primary conclusions: (1) the Taguchi-method-based tool proved effective for rapid and cost-effective development, and (2) the tool was successful in promptly and accurately identifying the best conditions for the cooling system. Different levels of all controlling factors were initially tested, then the significant and inconsequential factors were distinguished for the second trial, which involved evaluating every possible outcome by testing the maximum, intermediate, and minimum values for each setting of each factor. The second trial aimed to find the best combination by testing each important control factor at its optimal level. The cooling system's optimal conditions were then used to evaluate the effectiveness of the innovative tool.
