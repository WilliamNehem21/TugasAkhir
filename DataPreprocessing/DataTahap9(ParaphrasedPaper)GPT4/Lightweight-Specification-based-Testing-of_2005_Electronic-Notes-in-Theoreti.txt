The expansion of mobile device markets necessitates the development of reliable memory cards. Samsung, a leading producer in this sector, is enhancing its validation process for memory cards. A pilot project utilizing formal methods and specification-based testing validated Samsung's MultimediaCard (MMC) system. The system was tested using Esterel to formalize behavior models of MMC hosts which also functioned as oracles to automate testing. The co-simulation of host and card models was performed in a verification environment called Seamless, incorporating scenario-based and random testing.

Embedded systems with computer functionalities, such as cellphones, electric ovens, traffic controllers, power plant systems, and car navigation, have memory cards following various standards, including MMC. These systems often possess co-designed hardware and software, with intricate application logic, and are developed with great attention due to their potential impact on safety or finances, though memory cards themselves are viewed as less critical in this regard.

The MMC specification was utilized to build a test oracle and define permitted card behaviors, focusing on block-oriented data transfers due to Samsung's product offerings. Testing was carried out on Seamless, a hardware/software co-simulation tool, with test harness code from the formal model integrated with the MMC card's software and hardware code. The testing approach was demonstrated to be more effective than simple random testing.

The paper proposes a lightweight specification-based testing method, allowing for a practical application of formal methods in testing memory card systems. Engineers can benefit from this method as it easily integrates into existing processes and employs formal modeling languages to create precise test harnesses.

Difficulties encountered included the excessive time required for hardware and software emulation, which could be mitigated by future tools that translate Verilog code into C, easing speed issues. There are dedicated commercial tools for embedded system verification like Specman and Vera; however, open languages like Esterel offer independence from any specific vendor and access to analysis tools.

Looking ahead, formal verification such as model checking could be explored using the formal model of the MMC host. Although constructing the model of the MMC card would pose a challenge due to the need for product detail, upcoming versions of Seamless could simplify this task. Comparing testing results across different methods would require another card model, but this is considered feasible.

Lastly, the absence of a standardized language for specifying test cases in embedded systems like memory cards necessitates programming test benches from scratch. A dedicated test language for embedded systems could significantly ease the burden on verification engineers.
