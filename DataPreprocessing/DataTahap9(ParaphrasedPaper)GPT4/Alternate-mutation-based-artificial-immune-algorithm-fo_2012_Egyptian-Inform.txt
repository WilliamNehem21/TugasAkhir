The academic paper discusses a specific variation of the fixed-charge transportation problem (FCTP) known as the step fixed-charge transportation problem (SFCTP), wherein fixed costs are incurred on every employed route and are proportional to the shipped quantity. The objective function in SFCTP resembles a step function due to this cost structure. Several methods have been developed to solve FCTP, including Lagrangian relaxation, heuristics, genetic algorithms, and more-for-less and branching methods.

The paper reviews prior methods for solving SFCTPs and introduces a new algorithm called the Mutation-Based Artificial Immune (MAI) algorithm. In comparison to earlier techniques such as BAL, KOW, ALT1, ALT2, and ALT3, the MAI algorithm demonstrates improved performance and solution quality. The MAI algorithm employs solutions as evolving "antibodies," with better-fitting solutions undergoing less mutation. The shipping procedure proposed in the paper allocates transported units based on decoding procedure outputs, guaranteeing that solutions meet two key constraints and are applicable to both balanced and unbalanced transportation problems without the need for dummy suppliers or customers.

The authors describe a set of mutation functions (MFs) designed to enhance solution quality and test them across forty problems of varying sizes, with a particular focus on two problems to evaluate MAI algorithm performance. They further explore the use of artificial immune systems (AIS) in real-world complex applications such as job shop scheduling and multi-objective optimization problems.

Numerous mutation functions are designed with different parameters, including a non-uniform factor and a degree of non-uniformity. Some functions depend on time elapsed, with fewer swaps as more time passes, and others on solution fitness, where higher normalized fitness (indicating worse solutions) leads to more swaps. This provides opportunities for lower-quality solutions to mutate and improve.

The paper also emphasizes the importance of mutation functions in the algorithm's performance through calibration exercises, utilizing relative percentage deviation (RPD) metrics for comparison due to different objective function scales.

Lastly, the paper implements an affinity calculation among antibodies to prevent similar, highly evaluated solutions from dominating and causing premature convergence to local optima. By counting the number of similar elements between solutions, the algorithm identifies and reduces redundancy within the population, promoting diversity and improving the search process. The paper concludes with discussion on this and anticipates future work.
