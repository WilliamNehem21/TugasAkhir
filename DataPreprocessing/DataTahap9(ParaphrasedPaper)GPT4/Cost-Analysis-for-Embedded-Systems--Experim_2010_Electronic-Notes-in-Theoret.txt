This research paper discusses the challenge of analyzing resource consumption in complex embedded systems. As these systems grow in components, understanding timing and memory access costs becomes crucial. The study explores the use of simple models through priced timed automata, advancing the investigation with automated analysis tools such as UPPAAL Cora.

Various frameworks exist for modeling and analyzing hardware-software systems, including ARTS, which assists in pre-implementation design analysis. However, ARTS lacks full state space investigation to assure properties. Unlike ARTS, the authors experiment with priced timed automata to model components with associated costs, utilizing UPPAAL Cora for cost analysis, which is part of the UPPAAL family supporting both simulation and model checking.

After introducing an elemental embedded system for examination, the paper summarizes priced timed automata, presents a formal system model, conducts experiments, and formally analyzes specific scenarios. The study's goal is to demonstrate that priced timed automata are viable for embedded system modeling and UPPAAL Cora is effective for exploring design spaces.

The authors focus on optimizing resource costs, considering task waiting times, run times, and memory usage, aiming to identify the most cost-effective resource deployment. Instead of traditional scheduling such as earliest deadline first, they seek a schedule that minimizes costs in consideration of task data dependencies. This involves modifying the scheduling to allow a non-determined choice of task rather than a predefined one, making it possible for UPPAAL Cora to determine an optimal schedule.

The experiments assess waiting times and memory accesses, while also aiming to optimize task scheduling to minimize costs. The paper shares performance benchmarks, revealing verification times of about 1 second for non-optimization tasks and approximately 25 seconds when UPPAAL Cora performs optimization, on a 2 GHz Pentium 4 machine with 512 MB RAM.

In conclusion, though the research uses fundamental models, it provides evidence that priced timed automata and UPPAAL Cora hold promise for reasoning about resource consumption in embedded systems, pointing towards a foundational step in this analytical domain.
