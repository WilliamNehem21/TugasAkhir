Adaptive noise cancellation is a signal-estimation technique used to filter out additive noise or interference from signals. It utilizes two inputs: a primary input containing the desired signal with noise and a secondary reference input, which is related to the noise in the primary signal. The reference signal is adaptively filtered and subtracted from the primary input to produce a cleaner estimate of the original signal. This approach is useful when a suitable reference input is accessible.

Thakor and Zhu, along with several other researchers, have extensively explored adaptive filtering techniques for enhancing the quality of ECG signals by removing various types of noise, including power line interference (PLI), muscle, and motion artifacts. These studies have proposed and tested different adaptive noise cancellation methods, algorithms such as the least mean squares (LMS), recursive least squares (RLS), and their variations.

Some studies developed special algorithms like a nonlinear method for PLI elimination and employed accelerometers to reduce motion artifacts in ECG signals during physical stress. Others investigated filtering structures and their impact on noise reduction, including work on adaptive Kalman filters and simulations of LMS algorithm performance.

Researchers also evaluated the efficiency of different algorithms, concluding that in some cases, RLS was more effective than LMS for ECG noise removal. There were also comparisons among various types of noise cancellation algorithms and studies supporting the use of adaptive noise cancellers with optimized step-sizes.

More complex adaptive filters, such as cascaded multi-stage systems, were proposed to tackle multiple types of artifacts simultaneously. Some studies demonstrated superior performance of such cascaded systems over single-stage adaptive noise cancellers. Moreover, there was interest in sign adaptive filters for ECG processing due to their lower computational complexity, despite trade-offs in performance related to the clipping effect.

Overall, the research indicates a trend towards identifying the most effective adaptive filtering techniques for eliminating ECG artifacts, with ongoing work focusing on comparing various normalized adaptive algorithms and their sign counterparts. These efforts aim to ascertain the best strategies for artifact removal using adaptive filters to ultimately improve the quality of ECG signal analysis.
