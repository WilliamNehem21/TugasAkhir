Definition 2.2: A free arc is defined as a segment in a directed graph with multiple edges where no specific time limit is set. Its weight is a variable function that is based on the time "t" at which the journey begins from the arc's starting point. This weight function is influenced by the type of transportation being used.

When searching for routes, for instance, by using an algorithm derived from Dijkstra's algorithm or its many adaptations, two metrics are calculated at each node: the time at which the node is reached and the current weight of the route up to that point. According to the previously mentioned model, route weights are adjusted and compared at each visited node. Additionally, the weights of routes can incorporate various factors such as arrival time, the number of transfers, and the latest possible departure time.

The goal is to find the optimal route, which is either the one with the earliest arrival time considering a set departure time or, conversely, the one with the latest possible departure time considering a set arrival time. The optimality criterion is based on weighing the costs or consequences of each transfer, which is quantified by a parameter "p".
