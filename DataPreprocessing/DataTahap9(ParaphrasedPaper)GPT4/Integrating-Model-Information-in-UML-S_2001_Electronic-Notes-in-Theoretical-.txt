The academic paper discusses the process of refining class diagrams by adding object constraints to the classes. These constraints comprise invariants for the classes and their attributes, as well as preconditions and postconditions for the operations that the classes can perform. Additionally, association end multiplicities can also be depicted as constraints. These constraints are expressed formally in textual format using the Object Constraint Language (OCL).

For instance, to illustrate a postcondition for a server operation called `getFreeIP()`, the constraints can be evaluated as true when there are no inconsistencies identified within the model. If inconsistencies are found, the model is deemed inconsistent or incomplete. The validity of the constraints may change based on variable values such as attribute values. In scenarios where every possible variable assignment leads to the constraint being evaluated as false, the expression is considered contradictory, indicating a critical error in the model.
