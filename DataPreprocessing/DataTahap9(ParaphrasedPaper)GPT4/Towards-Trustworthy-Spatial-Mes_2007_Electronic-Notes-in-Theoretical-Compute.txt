Spatial messaging involves posting virtual information in physical locations which can be accessed by anyone nearby. Currently, existing systems that allow for this lack user interest, which is partly due to the absence of trust and security measures that confirm message credibility. The paper outlines a new spatial messaging framework that integrates these mechanisms, potentially enhancing the reception and use of spatial messaging in conjunction with the advancing mobile and localization technology.

Presently, mobile technology mainly serves for downloading information, but the trend is shifting towards more active engagement where users also publish information. Given the rapid advancements in mobile computing and the prevalence of smartphones, future growth in mobile technology is highly anticipated. This is bolstered by the interest in location-aware services, as demonstrated by the popular Mobile Mappy service for maps and POIs.

The ActiveCampus Explorer system represents a further innovation by showing the locations of users in real time. While the potential for restricting message visibility is present, the paper does not evaluate whether it's beneficial or problematic; instead, the technical means to maintain privacy or public visibility are discussed.

Trust concept implementation between machines or between humans and machines is complex. The paper discusses a registration process for users to join a spatial messaging service, where they receive a unique pseudonym and key pair while retaining anonymity. It prevents sybil attacks and ensures each pseudonym is unique and linked to a private key that must be verified upon connection.

The paper also presents a standard XML-based format for representing virtual tags (vtags) to ensure interoperability among different services. This would avoid the necessity to install new software for each new service.

In conclusion, the paper argues that trust and security are crucial for the success of spatial messaging, and outlines the deployment of a new spatial messaging framework, GeoVTag, to be validated in real-world settings. This framework aims to foster trust among users in a community, even if their actual identities remain concealed.
