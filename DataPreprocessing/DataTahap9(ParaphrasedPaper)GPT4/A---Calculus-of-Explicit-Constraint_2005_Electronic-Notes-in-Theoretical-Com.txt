The process under discussion can be effectively broken down into two distinct phases: first, the determination of a substitution based on certain criteria, and second, the act of implementing the identified substitution. Such a breakdown does not necessarily imply that the intermediate steps, those that transition from initial conditions to the eventual substitutions and the application thereof, are transparent or revealed. They are, however, conceptually distinguishable. Depending on the theoretical framework utilized for matching, these processes may carry considerable weight and complexity, and the objective is to delineate and clarify them.

Furthermore, applying a rewrite system in practice is often more complex than the simplified version initially described. The basic explanation covers merely a single (meta) rewriting stage, whereas in reality, the implementation often requires a more intricate approach due to the need to incorporate an evaluation strategy. This complexity is managed by employing (typed) fixed points that enable the rewrite system to be applied in a recursive manner, as detailed extensively elsewhere.
