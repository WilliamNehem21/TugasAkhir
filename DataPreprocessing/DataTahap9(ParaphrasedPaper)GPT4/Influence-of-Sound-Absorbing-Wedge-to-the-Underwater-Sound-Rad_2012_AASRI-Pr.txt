The sonar platform's self-noise significantly influences its effectiveness. Lowering self-noise levels enhances sonar detection sensitivity and extends its operational range. Predicting self-noise allows for a quantitative assessment of its magnitude, and understanding how different noise sources contribute to self-noise can guide the development of strategies to mitigate it and set specific technical standards for noise control.
