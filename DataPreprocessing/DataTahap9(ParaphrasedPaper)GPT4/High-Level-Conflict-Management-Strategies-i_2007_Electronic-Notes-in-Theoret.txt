Specifying an access control policy that incorporates both permissions and prohibitions may lead to situations where conflicts arise, with subjects at once allowed and disallowed from executing certain actions on objects. Comparative research has been conducted to address this dilemma, starting with the analysis of rule-based access control (Rule-BAC) models and pinpointing their limitations in conflict management, including indecision related to redundant rules and potential conflicts.

The research highlights that Rule-BAC models lack a method for resolving conflicts in a decisive manner. A structured approach is proposed, exemplified by the Organization-Based Access Control (Or-BAC) model, which aims to handle conflict through a more sophisticated framework. A conflict resolution strategy (CRS) involves rules designating when access permissions and prohibitions should be considered definitive.

The authors suggest addressing conflicts by classifying rules with respective priorities. The relationship among rules depends on their syntax, with higher priority rules rendering lower ones inapplicable, potentially causing redundancy. The notion of unrelated rules is introduced to denote those that don't conflict due to their conditions; their priorities need not be compared, lending efficiency to the system.

Additionally, the concept of exceptions, where specific rules override general ones, is formalized to ensure avoidance of redundancy through proper prioritization. The paper further defines actual and potential conflicts, clarifying situations where conflicting scenarios might occur in certain contexts but not others, depending on the specific conditions present at the time.

Moreover, the Or-BAC model is described as segregating access control policies into abstract organizational terms, thus permitting hierarchies of roles, activities, and other elements to inherit permissions and prohibitions. Managing conflicts within Or-BAC also involves setting priorities, which can be automated based on context, role, or other criteria.

The paper discusses other works in the field, comparing various models that deal with conflicts through strategies such as overriding weak authorizations with strong ones, and using logical frameworks to articulate and resolve rule conflicts. It also explores conflict management within the Or-BAC model, emphasizing the need to define CRS at the organizational level to assign priorities effectively.

Finally, the authors mention the focus on conflicts within a single organization, but the research also extends to cross-organizational interoperability conflicts. The study concludes with future considerations, looking at extending conflict management to administrative rules, including those concerning delegation within the Or-BAC administration model.
