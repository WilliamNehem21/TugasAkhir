In summary, Action Research (AR) aims to solve practical, real-world issues while contributing to the expansion of scientific knowledge, particularly in situations too complex for straightforward research queries. As a participatory research method, it transforms participants into researchers and enhances their competencies because they are involved in applying solutions they have developed, in contrast with traditional methods which keep observers and participants separate. AR follows iterative stages to monitor and improve research projects and allows theories to emerge from practice, addressing the gap where many approaches don't sufficiently test or develop theories. These reasons explain AR's suitability for evaluating e-government systems.

During the descriptive step, a researcher outlines the facts as a socially shared reality among all participants. Detailing includes multiple readings of background information and interview transcripts with the service provider, coding of the text by paragraphs, and compiling the coded data.

The planning stage involves setting objectives, designing the process to meet these goals, and confirming agreement among participants. It includes defining tasks, forming task groups, creating schedules, considering pilot surveys (questionnaires), and listing evaluation items, all while ensuring flexibility for unexpected changes and unrecognized constraints.

The paper compares situations before and after the initiation of the University Enrollment System (UES) service in Egypt. Initially, students purchased paper application forms at designated offices, manually filling out their preferences. With the introduction of the UES, a web-based system replaced this, supported by a call center, providing free, accessible online applications.

In Phase I, the UES, a seasonal service, is reviewed through a service surveying step, where student ID and password are needed for access. In Phase III, the descriptive step involves thorough reviews and coding of interview transcripts, resulting in coded documentation to inform the study.

The research commences with an exploration of different research paradigms, interpretive research background, and concepts of grounded theory and action research. It proposes and applies two frameworks, the Government E-framework (GEF) and the Action Research E-framework (AREF), for the evaluation of e-government systems using the UES case study.
