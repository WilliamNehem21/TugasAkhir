The depletion of fossil fuels and increasing air pollution have led to a global environmental sustainability crisis, which necessitates the utilization and enhancement of renewable energy resources. One crucial aspect of energy conservation is the development of heat storage systems.

Energy supply and demand often don't align temporally, making thermal storage systems a valuable solution. Thermal energy can be stored in three primary forms: sensible heat, latent heat, and thermo-chemical energy. Among these, latent heat storage using phase change materials (PCMs) is particularly effective. PCMs have a high heat of fusion and can store or release large amounts of heat through transitions between solid and liquid phases.

Storing thermal energy as latent heat has the significant benefit of allowing for a large quantity of heat to be stored in a compact space, resulting in high storage density. Zalba et al. conducted a comprehensive review on classifying PCMs, which are typically categorized into organic (paraffinic and non-paraffinic) and inorganic (mostly hydrated salts). Organic PCMs offer several advantages, such as consistent melting behavior, non-corrosive properties, high latent heat fusion, variable melting temperatures based on carbon chain length, minimal supercooling, chemical stability, and limited toxicity. However, their main limitation is their low thermal conductivity, which leads to substantial thermal gradients during heat transfer phases. Conversely, inorganic PCMs boast higher storage capacities but suffer from incongruent melting behavior.

The thermal storage system explored in this context consists of a shell and tube heat exchanger where the heat transfer fluid circulates within the tubes and the PCM is housed in the shell. The PCM absorbs heat from the fluid through the tube walls, leading to a thermal gradient within the PCM. Over time, the slope of this temperature gradient decreases, attributable to the PCM's low thermal conductivity and significant thermal inertia (high specific heat).
