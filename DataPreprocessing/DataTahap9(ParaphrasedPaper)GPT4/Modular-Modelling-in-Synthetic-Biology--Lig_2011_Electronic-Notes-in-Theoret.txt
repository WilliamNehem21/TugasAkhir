Rule-based approaches offer significant advantages in the field of synthetic biology, particularly for addressing the challenge of managing the extensive variations that arise when molecular entities exhibit multiple states, such as differences in phosphorylation. These methods provide a scalable way to handle the combinatorial complexity without the need to list every potential species that could emerge from a set of rules, thereby simplifying computational demands.

The Kappa model developed in this research encapsulated the system in question using 145 rules that defined the roles of sixteen BioBrick parts, excluding components for light sensors (which were presumed to be constitutively expressed) and related proteins. The model rules were organized into seven modules: the central repressilator (itself a composition of three devices), three sets for light detection, and three sets for light emission. The model's structure and its modules are discussed in depth in Section 4.

Such models facilitate more intuitive understanding of biological phenomena and promise increased reusability within different scenarios or across various models. The corresponding BioBrick modeling framework is particularly conducive for working with individual biological parts. Its utility is expected to rise with the advent of specialized support tools. Additionally, the modular nature of this modeling strategy lends itself well to flexible, iterative development processes, thereby streamlining both the complexity of the model and the modeling procedure.
