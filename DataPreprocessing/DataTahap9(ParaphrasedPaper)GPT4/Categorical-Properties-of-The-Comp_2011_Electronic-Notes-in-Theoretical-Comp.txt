The paper presents a framework for identifying when a physics theory might inherently utilize complex numbers. This framework is articulated in terms of intuitive and physical properties that focus on the interactions of physical processes, rather than on specific details of dynamics or measurement within the theory.

The authors propose considering the "category of processes" associated with a theory and point out that many theories, including quantum mechanics, can be represented in this way. They suggest using separable Hilbert spaces and bounded linear maps as a model for these categories in quantum mechanics, a theory known for its reliance on complex numbers.

A key concept in this framework is the definition of "scalars" within any monoidal category (a mathematical structure where objects and morphisms represent physical systems and processes, respectively), which are identified as the hom-set Hom(I, I) and maintain additional structures that emerge from the properties of the category itself. These scalars form a commutative monoid under morphism composition.

The paper includes proofs that rely on the established properties of the scalars, such as commutativity, cancellation for addition, and multiplication. For instance, a lemma in the paper helps demonstrate that the sum of squares of non-zero self-adjoint elements in a certain field is always non-zero, implying that the self-adjoint elements can admit an ordering. Although there's no uniqueness or canonical choice for this order, it is notable that such an order can exist.

By leveraging these mathematical properties, the authors aim to show that if a category of processes fits their described structure and certain conditions are met, then the associated physical theory inherently utilizes complex numbers.

The paper concludes by discussing proofs related to the aforementioned properties and structures, and ultimately substantiates the main theorem that connects the category of processes to the use of complex numbers in the underlying physical theory. This allows for an understanding of how and when complex numbers play a crucial role in the formulation of a physical theory, based on category-theoretic considerations.
