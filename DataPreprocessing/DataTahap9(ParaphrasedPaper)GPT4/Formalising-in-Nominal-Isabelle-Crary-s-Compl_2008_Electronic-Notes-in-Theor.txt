It can be noted that the presence of a formalized proof enables rapid assessment of modifications to ascertain their impact on the proof as a whole. This was particularly helpful in evaluating whether lemmas or definitions required reinforcement or could be relaxed. The availability of a formal proof also facilitated the composition of this academic paper, thanks to the comprehensive support provided by Isabelle for incorporating formal definitions and conducting consistency verifications within papers. Such tools are invaluable in ensuring that formalizations and the accompanying written documents remain aligned. The inductive principles, as well as the formulations of the lemmas and theorems discussed in this document, have been derived from the formal definitions.
