This paper presents two innovative techniques for enhancing the verification of distributed systems using Maude, a formal language and logic environment for system specification. The first technique introduced is an "on-the-fly" symmetry reduction method. This method relies on the lexicographic order of metarepresentations of Maude terms, enabling the selection of a canonical representative for each state's symmetry group, thereby aiding in the reduction of the state space during the systemâ€™s execution, exploration, and model checking processes. The second technique involves the use of auxiliary data to examine complex system properties that cannot be directly expressed in linear temporal logic, although this may result in an enlarged state space.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 covers Maude background information relevant to object-based specifications. In Section 3, the authors provide a specification for a simplified version of the chain-replication protocol critical for verifying system behaviors. Section 4 details the on-the-fly symmetry reduction approach and its application to this protocol. Section 5 introduces the verification method using auxiliary data for the protocol's strong-consistency property, which requires more than what linear temporal logic can express directly. The paper concludes in Section 6.

Central to the paper's theme is the notion that many distributed systems feature identical components. Identifying and leveraging this symmetry can reduce redundancy in behavior exploration, as each identical component is likely to experience similar state transitions. For the client-server protocol discussed, permutations of indices among the identical components (e.g., clients) correspond to automorphisms, leaving the protocol's behavior unchanged and thus exploitable for state-space reduction.

The permutation representation introduced includes partially defined permutations, with the general definition adapted for context-dependent term roles, such as distinguishing between index representation and counting usage. A key point is that the verification of the protocol considers both the final value received by the client and the current value it holds. Therefore, the verification property's form is complex and requires a transformation of the specification for effective analysis.

The paper asserts that the on-the-fly symmetry reduction technique implemented results in significant resource savings, allowing for the verification of intricate properties, such as the strong-consistency property of the client-server (chain-replication) protocol, which was successfully verified in several instances.
