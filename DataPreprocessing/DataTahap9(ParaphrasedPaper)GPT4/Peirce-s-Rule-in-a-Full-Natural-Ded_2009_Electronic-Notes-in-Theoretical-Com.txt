The original paper posits that Natural Deduction (ND) for first-order classical logic can be derived from the intuitionistic system by adding Peirce's rule. Previously, the authors presented a way to normalize deductive structures within the implicational fragment of logic that includes Peirce's rule. The resulting normal form consists of an initial deduction based on intuitionist principles and then possibly a number of applications of Peirce's rule.

The paper aims to expand this normalization approach, but it highlights an important issue concerning the strong normalization (SN) property. While SN is established for both classical and intuitionistic natural deduction systems, as shown by Prawitz and Gandy—with Gandy offering a more straightforward proof—it is assumed to hold for the implicational fragment as well. However, the paper reveals a counterexample wherein adding Peirce's rule to the implicational fragment results in a failure of the strong normalization property. That means that, under certain conditions, the reduction process can continue indefinitely without reaching a normal form. This demonstrates that the implicational fragment with Peirce's rule (NP-imp) does not adhere to the strong normalization property, contrasting with the implicational fragments without it.
