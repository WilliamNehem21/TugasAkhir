This paper examines the dynamics and outcomes of fixed time forward online auctions, focusing on comparisons between auctions that allow only a single bid versus those that accept multiple bids. Mathematical models are developed to analyze the behavior of auction participants and the economic implications for buyers and sellers. Theoretical models are validated through extensive simulations.

The paper discusses the widespread practice of internet auctions and highlights the benefit of selling goods with uncertain value through a variable pricing model. Additionally, the influence of seller ratings on final auction prices and the effect of auction duration on achieving higher sale prices is explored.

The research further analyzes the economic benefits for both buyers and sellers when multiple bids are accepted in an auction featuring multiple identical items. Through theoretical and simulation approaches, the study assesses the efficiency of multi-bid auctions and examines the parameters that can be adjusted to optimize surplus for either party.

An auction process simulator written in C++ validates the theoretical models by generating auction results and examining the relationship between the number of competing bids and auction income. Results suggest that a higher number of bids tends to increase income, with shorter auctions being potentially more favorable.

Lastly, the paper investigates the role of auction parameters in deterring collusion among bidders and shill bidding by sellers. The optimal auction duration and the decision to accept multiple bids are strategically analyzed to enhance seller surplus. It is found that the average number of bids significantly impacts auction performance, and simulations show strong consistency with theoretical predictions.
