Sharing data or services across different tenant applications is challenging within a SaaS platform due to security measures that ensure isolation among tenants. This segregation is maintained even though multiple tenants' code and data may reside in the same database.

Service-oriented SaaS, using a combination of service-oriented architecture (SOA) and SaaS domain ontology, delineates domain knowledge from infrastructure to enable flexibility across different sectors. A development framework called EasySaaS was created to simplify SaaS development by leveraging these architectures.

Variation points refer to specific areas within software where changes can occur, with variants being the alternative options. The concept of software product families incorporates variability management to accommodate these changes effectively. Kang, Coplien, and Webber introduced methodologies for identifying commonalities and differences within software families and developed techniques for extending components to adapt to these variabilities. Mietzner contributed a variability descriptor, transforming it into a WS-BPEL process model, and suggested explicit variability models for SaaS providers to customize applications for diverse tenant needs.

Crowdsourcing involves tenants delegating tasks to domain experts rather than developing applications themselves, optimizing efficiencies across all the stages of SaaS development through community involvement.

The paper introduces a two-tiered system for calculating "goodness" and "importance," comprising a batch layer and a real-time layer. The batch layer computes over intervals, delivering an accurate static rank utilizing big data solutions like Hadoop and Spark, while the real-time layer provides prompt, provisional results.

Real-time calculations ensure dynamic ranking by retrieving relevant tenant and component changes, forming a subgraph from enhanced root sets. In large pools of tenants and components, technologies such as Solr, Elasticsearch, and graph databases help manage complexity and maintain rapid processing through big data systems like Apache Kafka and Storm.

Tsai's work on application templates was referenced in the paper to support the development process. Elastic Search and Solr index template keywords, enhancing the ranking mechanism of components.

The paper proposed a tenant-centric approach integrating crowdsourcing and ranking models, both static and dynamic, to help tenants efficiently create and deploy customized applications. The ranking architecture presented supports scalability, and the experiments conducted confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed models.
