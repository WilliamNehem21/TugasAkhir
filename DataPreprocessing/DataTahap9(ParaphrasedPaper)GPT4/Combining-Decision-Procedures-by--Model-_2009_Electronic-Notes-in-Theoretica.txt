Paraphrasing:

The use of formal methods in the development of computing systems typically leads to the creation of verification conditions that must be proven to ensure the system's correctness. These conditions define the characteristics of models or the relationships between models and can be articulated using a variety of logical systems ranging from propositional logic to higher-order logic, as well as process algebra and temporal logic. The degree of automation achievable for verification within a given formalism is closely linked to the availability of tools that facilitate reasoning within these different logics.

The subsequent section will introduce notations and the fundamental concepts of SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) solvers. In the third section, we outline an abstract model for SMT solvers, which acts mainly as a basis for our discussion on the soundness and completeness of the combination framework addressed in this paper. This model does not intend to provide an exhaustive description of solvers like the DPLL(T) framework does but rather simplifies the differentiation between boolean and theory-specific reasoning. Understanding DPLL(T) as a more detailed version of our simplified schema is not challenging.

Considering that the main hurdle in merging proof assistants with SMT solvers is not the efficiency of the SMT solvers themselves, we haven't concentrated on the speed of our implementation. Specifically, we haven't incorporated theory propagation. Nevertheless, we noticed that for certain QF_UFIDL benchmarks, our system operates with comparable speed to the Z3 solver.

In future research, we aim to apply this technique to other decidable fragments, such as complete linear arithmetic for integers and reals. Our current implementation already includes a comprehensive first-order theorem prover capable of handling user-defined theories. We plan to explore the advantages of our framework when extended with such user-generated theories.
