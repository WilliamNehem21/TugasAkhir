Controlled complementary measurements are fundamental to quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols like BB84 and EKERT91, among other applications. This paper develops a formalism to represent controlled complementary measurements using symmetric monoidal categories, revealing a new graphical calculus method. The paper then applies this calculus to analyze the BB84 and EKERT91 protocols, including scenarios where an eavesdropper attempts an intercept-resend attack.

The paper's primary contribution is presenting a systematic approach to combining the concepts of complementary observables and controlled observables within the framework of symmetric monoidal categories. This innovative strategy is detailed in Section 3. Consequently, the paper offers a streamlined description of the QKD protocols BB84 and EKERT91 and affirms their validity. Additionally, it examines the impact of an intercept-resend attack on these protocols in Sections 4 and 5. Prior to these analyses, Section 2 provides an overview of previous research on the theoretical underpinnings necessary for graphical calculus, such as bases, complementarity, measurement, control, and the divide between classical and quantum perspectives.
