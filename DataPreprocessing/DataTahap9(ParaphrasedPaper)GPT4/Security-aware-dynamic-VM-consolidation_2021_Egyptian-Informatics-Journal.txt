This academic paper discusses the growing popularity of cloud computing solutions, with their on-demand, cost-effective resources offered on a pay-as-you-go model. Notably, such growth has significant energy implications, as cloud data centers (CDCs) are estimated to consume approximately 1% of global electricity. This consumption poses challenges for energy management in CDCs.

Methods such as Dynamic Virtual Machine Consolidation (DVMC) have been studied for their potential to mitigate energy consumption issues in CDCs without compromising service level agreements. These methods are effective as they save energy by shifting VMs from underused hosts to more active ones and then reducing the power state of the underused hosts. Despite the focus on power efficiency and maintaining quality of service (QoS), there has been less attention on the security implications of DVMC.

The paper highlights concerns that DVMC could introduce security risks, such as VMs being used as stepping stones for attacks on the host hypervisor and other VMs that share resources. Therefore, the distribution of VMs across physical machines in the CDC carries weight for both security and energy consumption, indicating a need for research that considers all three aspects: security, energy, and QoS.

To address this need, the research introduces a novel approach, Secure DVMC (SDVMC), underpinned by a three-dimensional security assessment model. This model takes into account the security risks of the VM, its directly connected VMs, and co-located VMs to calculate a comprehensive security score for each VM. The SDVMC consists of two main components: a Security Management Module (SMM) and an SDVMC module that tackles four subproblemsâ€”detecting host underload and overload, selecting VMs, and placing them based on their security scores to minimize risk.

The paper then outlines a new VM placement algorithm called MRI with a Risk Increase Threshold (RITH), which strives to maintain a low overall risk that adheres to the RITH constraint during placement.

Utilizing the CloudSim simulation toolkit, the authors made modifications to gain more precise comparative insights between their approach and others that use a default energy-aware VM placement strategy. The results indicate that the proposed SDVMC approach yields significant security improvements while balancing energy consumption and QoS.

Prior work by Jin Han et al. proposed a static security assessment model and a genetic algorithm-based VM placement but was limited by not addressing the real-time, online nature of DVMC and the computational overhead of genetic algorithms.

Overall, the researchers advocate for SDVMC that effectively manages VM allocation while maintaining a balance between security and performance parameters. The paper includes detailed discussions of the proposed methods, experimental designs, modifications to simulation metrics, and extensive experimental results.
