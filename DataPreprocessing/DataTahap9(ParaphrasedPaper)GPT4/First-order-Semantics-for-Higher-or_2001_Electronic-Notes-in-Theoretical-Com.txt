In the paper, it is stated that for newly generated subjects that are not connected to triggers or replicators, a standardization process occurs. This involves adjusting the numerical values within the relevant process term; each number is incremented by one and the base value is set to zero. Conversely, when these subjects become connected through the application of the connection rule, the previous numerical adjustments are reversed. These procedures are referred to as "shift" and "unshift" respectively.
