This academic paper's structure is outlined as follows: the methodology for teaching a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) through a specific example is detailed in the subsequent section. Section 3 introduces two additional examples, followed by Section 4 which elaborates on certain aspects of the implementation. The paper concludes in Section 5.

The utilized program retains all user responses throughout its operation, ensuring a membership query is never repeated. The algorithm consistently generates new hypothesis automatons that account for any past counterexamples.

Another illustration is provided to complete the segment. The objective is to define a language consisting of natural numbers divisible by 3. To ascertain divisibility, one sums the digits of a number, such as the number 12123, which adds up to 9â€”a number divisible by 3, confirming that 12123 is also divisible by 3.

Users have the flexibility to restart the program whenever necessary. Additionally, one can save the constructed automaton as a file compatible with the JFLAP software, enabling further manipulation and analysis using JFLAP's suite of automaton tools.

If desired, users can disable the feature that retains user input, reverting to a process more akin to the original learning algorithm. This less efficient mode delineates learning iterations more distinctly and permits users to introduce their own counterexamples for testing. The feature can be toggled in the options menu at any point during the program's execution.

JFLAP enhances this learning experience through its visual and interactive toolset, simplifying user interaction with the learning algorithm. Among its capabilities, JFLAP can compare finite automatons, convert nondeterministic finite automatons and regular expressions into minimal deterministic finite automatons, and verify string recognition by a finite automaton. Consequently, JFLAP can even directly interact with the learning algorithm presented.
