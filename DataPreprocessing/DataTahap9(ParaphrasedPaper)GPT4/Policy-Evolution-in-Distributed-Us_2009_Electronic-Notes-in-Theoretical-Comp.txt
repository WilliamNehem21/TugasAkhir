Usage control is an extension of traditional access control that not only manages the initial access to data but also how that data is used post-access, particularly in terms of further dissemination. The concept necessitates policies that dictate how data policies should be modified upon redistribution, proposing that policies should generally become more restrictive.

A role-based redistribution model is proposed that allows for the strengthening of both rights and duties associated with the use of data. The model uses a structured approach where events and their parameters are clearly defined, allowing for a systematic method of enhancing the obligations and rights concerning data use as seen through the lens of trace inclusion.

In the formal language of specification Z, events and parameters are defined using basic types within square brackets, with the use of EBNF-style definitions to express potential configurations.

Focusing first on rights, the model posits that policies concerning data rights should only become more stringent upon redistribution. Formally this means that allowable actions under new policies should be a subset of those allowed by the original policy, or that the new policy expressions logically imply adherence to the original policy.

For example, a policy might specify that a video (denoted as "mova") can be played with quality up to 75%. The intuitive understanding is that users should be allowed to play the video at any quality level equal to or less than this threshold, effectively reducing the permissible video quality rather than increasing it. However, a policy could also theoretically raise the minimum standard for video quality, which would restrict the user freedom in a different way, even if the act of improving the quality might seem counterintuitive in terms of restrictions.

The redistribution model also accounts for different roles of data recipients – customers, reporters, and academics – each having different rights and restrictions when it comes to playing a movie, editing it, or redistributing it.

Lastly, the paper references other research related to delegation policies and models in distributed systems. While delegation is identified as a problem by several authors, concrete solutions are scarce, and where they exist, they tend to be highly specific to particular applications.
