In the paper, the authors introduce String Multiset Rewriting (SMSR) as a novel intermediate language designed for the simulation of biomolecular systems. This language serves as a bridge, enabling higher-level biological modeling languages to be converted into SMSR. Subsequently, SMSR can be executed using modified versions of pre-existing simulation software.

Specifically, the authors present the transformation process of a high-level formalism known as CLS+ into SMSR. They establish the accuracy and thoroughness of this process, ensuring that the translation maintains the integrity of the original biological system descriptions.

SMSR facilitates simulation development; for example, one can enhance the Generalized Bead Simulation (GBS) simulator to handle it. The use of a "maximal matching operator" in SMSR simplifies the conversion of advanced languages, particularly those that draw upon term rewriting. This is because biological terms can be depicted as trees, with these trees further represented as a collection of strings that outline all paths from the tree's root to its leaves. Consequently, modifying a subtree equates to altering a set of strings that share a common prefix.

To define the behavior of SMSR, the paper describes both the syntax of terms and a congruence relation that outlines structural similarities. Furthermore, they introduce the concept of rewrite rules which detail how terms evolve through the application of these rules.

Patterns form the backbone of rewrite rules within SMSR. Each rewrite rule comprises two patterns: the first describes the current term, and the second outlines how that term transforms post-rule application. Variables within patterns afford flexibility, allowing rules to apply to any term derivable through the substitution of these variables with suitable elements or strings. The maximal matching operator is essential here, as it enables the handling of multisets of strings sharing a common prefix.

Overall, the paper advocates for SMSR as a useful and effective intermediate language that can accurately bridge the gap between high-level biological system formalisms and practical simulation tools by proving that translations maintain both correctness and completeness.
