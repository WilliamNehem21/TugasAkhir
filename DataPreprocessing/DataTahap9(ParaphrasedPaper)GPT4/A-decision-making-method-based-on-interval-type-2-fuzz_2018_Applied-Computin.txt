The paper discusses the application of Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP) to enhance ambulance dispatching and relocation strategies, emphasizing the significant reduction in response times experienced in Vienna, Austria. The paper highlights the critical role of dispatching and relocation decisions and adapts a model known as the Maximum Expected Coverage Location Problem to identify strategic locations for ambulances in Shah Alam, Selangor. By incorporating local OpenStreetMap geodata and algorithms such as Dijkstra, Quick Hull, and Greedy Adding, the research successfully applies the Maximal Covering Location Problem to ambulance location selection in Johor Bahru, Malaysia. Recent analysis on ambulance relocation strategies uses a double standard model for a fair performance evaluation.

The authors contend that ambulance location management is a crucial operational research issue, akin to a complex multi-objective optimization problem where emergency management must be addressed with limited resources, thus requiring the consideration of multiple qualitative resources.

The paper also examines the use of fuzzy sets in decision-making processes. While Type-1 Fuzzy Sets (T1 FS) are common and based on linguistic terms, they have limitations in expressing uncertainty. Therefore, the authors propose using Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Sets (IT2 FS) as they afford more flexibility in representing uncertainty encountered during information gathering, with larger intervals capturing a greater range of uncertainty.

The new method proposed, Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Simple Additive Weighting (IT2 FSAW), is designed to better handle the uncertain nature of expert evaluations for ambulance location selection, compared to the traditional methods which have a certain degree of inconsistency due to their inability to accommodate uncertainty as effectively. The IT2 FSAW results in a preference order for potential ambulance locations, with the best location showing marginally higher scores than others, followed by public clinics, parking lots, petrol stations, and highways, respectively. This preference order emerges from implementing the proposed method with linguistic data.

The study suggests that road networks are a crucial factor in determining ambulance locations. It recommends further validating methods like sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of the proposed approach and encourages applying the methodology to other real-world applications for additional research and validation.
