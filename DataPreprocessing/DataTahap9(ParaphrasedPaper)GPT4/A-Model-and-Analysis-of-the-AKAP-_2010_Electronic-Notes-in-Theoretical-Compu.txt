Our research delves into the biochemical interactions that occur through scaffolding-assisted communication between the cAMP and RAF-1/MEK/ERK signaling pathways. We apply a Continuous Time Markov Chain (CTMC) methodology to represent the system and use Continuous Stochastic Logic and the symbolic probabilistic model checker PRISM to analyze it. We investigate model properties focused on causal events and pulsating behaviors. To describe these properties more thoroughly, we incorporate trend formulas into the model. This approach is part of ongoing experimental wet-lab research and as such, was developed in close collaboration with experimental scientists.

Intracellular signaling pathways transmit signals from cell surface receptors to the nucleus to elicit cellular responses, where scaffold proteins play a pivotal role by binding and localizing signal-related proteins. Scaffolds can modulate signaling pathway outputs and response times. We focus on scaffold-mediated interactions between cAMP and RAF-1/MEK/ERK, where the AKAP scaffold protein participates in regulating cell processes such as growth and survival.

Our modeling approach for AKAP relies on stochastic computational methods and encapsulates the signaling activities using CTMCs with discrete concentration levels. We use PRISM and express temporal properties within Continuous Stochastic Logic (CSL), specifying causality and pulsations via trend formulas.

We give an overview of AKAP's activity, introduce the PRISM model, describe properties and analysis results, and conclude with prospects for further research.

Activation of RAF-1 involves the rise of cAMP which, in turn, activates PKA. When PKA is active, it phosphorylates RAF-1 regulating the signaling cascade. Additionally, the scaffold may include PDE8A1, which breaks down cAMP when activated by PKA, creating a feedback mechanism that regulates PKA activity.

We use binary notation to represent the state of the scaffold's binding sites: '1' signifies active/phosphorylated and '0' signifies inactive/unphosphorylated. For example, 's100' means the scaffold is activated with PKA active, whereas 's01' indicates an inactive PKA with a phosphorylated site.

The pulsating behavior of the system, suggested by lab experiments, implies that RAF-1 pathway activation fluctuates, potentially influenced by cAMP diffusion and its feedback with PKA activity. Pulsation, not oscillation, is used to describe the behavior, as current data does not suggest stable average values for such oscillation.

The PRISM model is constructed using modules that represent molecular species with variable levels of concentrations. We formalize the described properties and use PRISM to verify them. To account for causality and pulsation, trend formulas for particular variables are employed.

Future studies aim to characterize the pulsation amplitude and explore connections between CTMC model trends and differential equations. Other works, such as Biocham, have examined the impacts of derivatives on biochemically modeled systems, and we look to extend this analysis in our research.
