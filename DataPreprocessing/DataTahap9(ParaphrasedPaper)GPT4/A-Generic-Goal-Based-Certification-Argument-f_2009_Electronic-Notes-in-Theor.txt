The paper discusses how formal methods are effective for verifying and specifying safety-critical systems with a high level of confidence. However, there are questions regarding the substitution of traditional testing with formal methods for meeting certification objectives. The study examines two certification standards, DO-178B and the UK Defence Standard 00-56, looking at their acceptance of formal method evidence. It introduces a universal safety case framework that supports the use of formal analysis when seeking certification approval. This proposed safety case framework includes claims about achieving certification objectives, proving the reliability of formal analysis, and demonstrating the practical viability of utilizing formal methods in specific projects.

The paper elaborates on the challenges of ensuring mutual understanding of safety arguments among all involved parties due to the traditional use of unstructured text. To address these challenges, the paper describes a structured technique for clearly expressing and presenting safety arguments. The adoption of the Goal Structuring Notation (GSN) has shown benefits in enhancing comprehension of safety arguments among stakeholders, which improves discussions and expedites consensus on safety argumentation.

Empirical data from successful industrial case studies is emphasized as essential to showcase the effectiveness of formal methods. Case studies must demonstrate the integration of formal analysis with other design and assessment techniques and be based on real safety-critical systems. They should also acknowledge the limitations of formal methods and ensure the mathematical models correspond to actual system behavior at runtime.

The paper challenges the misconception that formal specifications and analysis are strictly theoretical, citing numerous successful industrial applications. It concludes by restating the review of the certification standards, and reiterates the role of the generic safety case in providing a solid foundation for the presentation and justification of formal analytical evidence to certification authorities.
