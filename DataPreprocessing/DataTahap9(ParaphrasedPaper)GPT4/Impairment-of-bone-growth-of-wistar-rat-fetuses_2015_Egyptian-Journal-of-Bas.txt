The study investigates the impact of diabetes and hypercholesterolemia on the development of atherosclerosis and bone healing impairment in limb ischemia during bone cell differentiation in Wistar rat fetuses. The research involved three groups of pregnant Wistar rats (20 each group): a control group, a diabetic group, and a hypercholesterolemic group. Diabetes was induced on gestational day five using streptozotocin, while hypercholesterolemia was induced by feeding female rats a high cholesterol diet for six weeks before conception. The pregnant rats were sacrificed on prenatal days 13, 15, 17, and 19, and the fetuses' limbs were examined using various methods including histology, transmission electron microscopy, calculating total calcium content, and checking for DNA damage.

The study found that fetuses from diabetic or hypercholesterolemic mothers had delayed bone development. Previous research has shown that type 1 diabetes reduces bone remodeling and leads to osteopenia in humans and animals, delays fracture healing, lowers bone mineral density, and decreases bone formation. Additionally, diabetic rats have shown reduced bone formation, decreased expression of osteocalcin, collagen types, increased bone cell apoptosis, and early intervertebral disc degeneration.

Hypercholesterolemic rats had reduced bone formation, indicating that factors in hypercholesterolemia may inhibit bone growth. The study used enzyme electrophoresis to examine the expression of isoenzymes like alkaline phosphatase and lactic dehydrogenase, which are important for bone metabolism. The researchers observed altered isoenzyme expression patterns in the fetuses of diabetic and hypercholesterolemic mothers, suggesting metabolic activity changes that may contribute to bone cell damage. The findings suggest that diabetes and hypercholesterolemia can negatively affect fetal bone cell differentiation and development, posing potential risks for bone health later in life.
