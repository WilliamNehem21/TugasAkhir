The academic paper describes a study in which the macro-algae Jania rubens and Sargassum dentifolium were collected from the Red Sea in Hurghada, Egypt, in May 2015. The collected samples of these algae were free from epiphytes, dirt, and dead material. After thorough washing with sea water and sterile distilled water, the algae were air-dried, cut into small pieces, and then ground into a fine powder using a tissue grinder.

This seaweed powder (1 g) was then mixed with 100 ml of distilled water and heated, leading to the formation of silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) which turned the solution light purple within an hour. To complete the reaction, the solution was left stirring for an additional 4 hours. The Ag-NPs associated with J. rubens and/or S. dentifolium were separated from the seaweed debris via centrifugation and then resuspended in double-distilled water for further analysis.

Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) tests showed that Ag-NPs can prevent biofilm formation. Biofilms are dense aggregates of bacteria that are notoriously resistant to antibiotics, chemicals, and phagocytosis. Inhibition of biofilm formation, particularly at the initial adherence stage, suggests that Ag-NPs could serve as a powerful tool against bacterial infections that are difficult to treat due to biofilm formation.

Results indicated that the least concentration of Ag-NPs that prevented color change (indicating growth) was considered effective, with growth being defined as at least a 2-fold increase in optical density at 595 nm (OD595) compared to a negative control. The MBC was defined as a 99.9% reduction in colony-forming units (CFUs) during a 24-hour incubation, and this was determined by transferring 50 ml of the culture medium and examining the resultant bacterial colony count. Moreover, the surface charge of the Ag-NPs appears to play a role in nanoparticle stabilization due to the repulsive forces between the particles.

This study builds on previous findings indicating that Ag-NPs synthesized from other sources, like Calotropis procera, are also effective against other pathogenic bacteria such as Vibrio cholerae and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli. The consistent inhibition of biofilm formation by Ag-NPs across various bacterial species emphasizes their potential as a tool for addressing one of the most significant challenges in modern medicineâ€”bacterial biofilms.
