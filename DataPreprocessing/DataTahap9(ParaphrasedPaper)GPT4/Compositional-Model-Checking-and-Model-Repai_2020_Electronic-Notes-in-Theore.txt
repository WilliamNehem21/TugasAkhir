The paper discusses various strategies for analyzing complex Markov models, such as Kronecker-based methods, aggregation/disaggregation, abstraction, approximation, symbolic approaches, and combinations of these techniques. It specifically highlights compositional analysis as a promising method. Compositional analysis involves examining individual components of a model separately and then combining the results to achieve an overall understanding of the system.

The paper's primary contribution is providing evidence that compositional model checking of global time-unbounded Continuous Stochastic Logic (CSL) formulas using the "until" operator is impossible. This holds true not only for general compositional Markov models but also for models in product form, which have a specific structure, including those known as Boucherie-type models.

The structure of the paper is outlined as follows:

1. Section 2 introduces the Markovian modeling framework, with a special focus on product-form models, particularly those of Boucherie type. It also reviews the state-of-the-art in compositional model checking for these models, pointing out significant limitations.
2. Section 3 demonstrates the general impossibility of compositional model checking for CSL's "until" operator, even when considering global properties in an unbounded temporal context, and even within the confines of Boucherie product-form models.
3. Section 4 explores the issue of model repair through adjusting rates (rate adaptation). Although another impossibility result is presented here, the authors offer a proposition enabling compositional model repair for a broad class of CSL global "until" formulas.
4. Section 5 concludes the paper with a brief summary of its main findings.

Fourneau, Plateau, and Stewart investigated a system without synchronization but with rates dependent on the system's state. Using the kernel of a set of transition matrices and under specific conditions, they proved that product form can be achieved with functional rates, generalizing earlier work and showing that the Boucherie framework applies in this context as well.

The paper further examines compositional model checking of time-unbounded global "until" formulas. However, the authors found it impossible to apply compositional model checking to these formulas, even when considering product-form models like those described by Boucherie.

Additional notes from the paper clarify that certain specific cases are addressed by the propositions presented, ensuring that the model repair process does not restrict the practical applicability of the methods proposed. Moreover, a particular condition ensures that if a given component satisfies a certain state property, it does not impede the progress of other components in the system.
