Boolean automata networks (BANs) are recognized as discrete frameworks that effectively model biological systems like neural and gene regulation networks. Such networks, especially those featuring local monotonicity, have been thoroughly investigated in both practical and theoretical contexts. That said, there's a growing interest in the study of networks that exhibit local non-monotonic behavior.

From a theoretical standpoint, it has been pointed out that non-local monotonic behavior often plays a role in the emergence of unique dynamics within BANs. For instance, research has revealed that the simplest form of a BAN that loses its robustness when adding simultaneous updating (synchronism) is locally non-monotonic.

A BAN is conceptualized as a collection of Boolean automata that interact within a network. The size of a BAN is determined by its number of automata. For a network of size n, we denote the set of automata as V = {1, ..., n}.
