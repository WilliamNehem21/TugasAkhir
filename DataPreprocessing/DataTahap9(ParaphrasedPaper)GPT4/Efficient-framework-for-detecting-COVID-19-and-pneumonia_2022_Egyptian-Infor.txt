The academic paper describes how diseases of the respiratory system, particularly pneumonia and COVID-19, are widespread, infectious, and can be fatal. The key to accurately diagnosing these conditions lies in the analysis of radiographic images. The term "consolidation" is used in radiology to denote an area of increased density in the lungs, typically visible on chest X-rays, caused by the filling of alveoli with substances like blood, fluid, pus, proteins, or cells. Detection of consolidations on chest X-rays is crucial for diagnosing various respiratory illnesses, including pneumonia and COVID-19. 

The paper also discusses a dataset consisting of 7,512 chest X-ray images in JPEG format, divided into three categories: COVID-19 with 1,323 images, pneumonia with 4,240 images, and normal with 1,949 images. The images are organized into sub-folders according to their classification. Moreover, the dataset underwent a quality control step where 33 images from the pneumonia category, which were part of the training set, were removed due to unspecified reasons.
