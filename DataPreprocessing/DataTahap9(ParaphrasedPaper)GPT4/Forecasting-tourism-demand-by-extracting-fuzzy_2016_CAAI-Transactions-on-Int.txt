The academic paper discusses the importance of tourism demand forecasting due to the economic significance of the tourism industry, and the need for more accurate and understandable forecasting models. The authors propose a novel method that uses Support Vector Machines with Rule Extraction (SVMRE) to generate Fuzzy TES rules from trained SVMs. This method aims to balance high forecasting accuracy, which SVMs offer, with the interpretability that comes from symbolic fuzzy rules. The approach was tested using Hong Kong SAR, China, as a case study, and showed that the method could match or outperform traditional SVMs and other forecasting techniques in terms of prediction accuracy for tourist arrivals from nine major origins.

The paper highlights the practical and scientific value of the novel approach, emphasizing its benefits for tourism market management due to the ease of interpretation provided by the extracted fuzzy TES rules for decision-makers. This SVMRE technique, which combines accurate machine learning models with comprehensible output, represents an advance in quantitative tourism forecasting by addressing the limitations of black-box models in the industry.

The research evaluates several time-series and causal relationship models against SVMRE and finds its performance superior in predictive accuracy and interpretability. The SVMRE method is further demonstrated to be promising for providing actionable insights for policy-makers and industry managers who require comprehensive yet easily understandable tools for forecasting and planning purposes.
