Kastelic identified the fascicle as the key structural component of tendons, which are primarily composed of microscopic molecules. These passive tensile tissues, similar to ligaments, consist predominantly of water (60-80%) and proteins like collagen and elastin. However, they contain only a small amount of ground substance, which is essential for the distinctive mechanical characteristics of the ligament. This ground substance, arranged alongside a Maxwell element, contributes to the viscoelastic behavior due to the presence of proteoglycans.

To fulfill their biomechanical role, the collagen fibrils within these tissues are aligned mainly in lengthy stretches along the direction of force. When a ligament experiences strain, the crimp pattern within the collagen fibers shows a reduction in the bend angle. This change is reversible and signifies that the deformation of the crump structure is one of the sources of the tissue's elasticity. Additionally, individual collagen fibrils possess intrinsic elasticity. Together, these two aspects are thought to play a significant role in defining the overall mechanical properties of passive tensile tissues.
