This academic paper emphasizes the importance of understanding software system evolution for various purposes such as reverse engineering and empirical research. The authors argue that an explicit meta-model is required for an effective comprehension of software evolution and introduce "HISMO," a meta-model founded on the concept of history. They demonstrate how to derive HISMO from an existing snapshot meta-model and discuss their experience in developing the HISMO-based reverse engineering system.

Many existing methods for studying software evolution focus on specific characteristics of the evolution process, such as frequently changed parts or types of changes that occur, but often lack explicit meta-models. This lack of standardized models makes it challenging to understand the precise implications of the results, as well as to compare and integrate various tools that might provide overlapping or complementary insights.

The authors have previously argued for and created an explicit history-centered meta-model called HISMO, implementing it in a tool named VAN, which operates within the MOOSE reengineering framework. HISMO has been used to analyze software evolution and has been validated through various reverse engineering studies.

Although the concept of history is not tied to any specific meta-model, like FAMIX, the paper proposes that the HISMO approach is versatile and can be conceptualized as a method to transform any snapshot meta-model into a history-focused meta-model. The paper delves into this idea by exploring evolution analysis through a model-driven engineering perspective, particularly in reverse engineering contexts.
