This investigation explores refinement in systems with partially known information. Specifically, it delves into systems where state transitions might be uncertain, applying a three-valued logic for dealing with unknowns. The researchers introduce a simulation relation tailored for such incomplete systems, demonstrating that verifying these relations can be equated to conducting two simulation checks on fully known systems, once incorporating an optimistic and once a pessimistic viewpoint on the missing information.

Refinement plays a crucial role in developing systems through iterative design. This process ensures that as a model evolves across various abstraction levels, the essential system behaviors remain unchanged, thereby maintaining functional consistency for end-users. Traditional techniques to affirm refinement include simulation relations that confirm the fidelity of system behavior pre- and post-transformation.

The paper also outlines the foundational concepts for complete systems before extending these to handle partial specifications. In this context, the systems are modeled using transition systems, defined over a set of operations or actions, that explain how system operations are performed.

The authors consider a scenario with a system comprising multiple components, where only one component is known. The behavior of this single component is influenced by interactions with the unknown components through shared variables or communication channels, leading to a partial understanding of the system's transitions.

By introducing a simulation relation for these partially known transition systems and embracing a three-valued logic, the study compares two approaches: one where unknowns simulate unknowns, and another where unknowns can only simulate known transitions. The latter approach, seen as more pragmatic, is used to demonstrate that simulation for partial systems aligns with performing two distinct simulation evaluations on fully known systems: one under optimism and the other under pessimism regarding the unknown transitions.
