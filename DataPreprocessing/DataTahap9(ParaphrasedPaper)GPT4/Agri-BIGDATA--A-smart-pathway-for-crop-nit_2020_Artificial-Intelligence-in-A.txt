Big data offers a promising avenue for enhancing sustainability in agriculture by potentially reducing nitrogen usage in crops, from the breeding stage to field management. Interdisciplinary collaborations involving plant health monitoring, advanced machine learning algorithms, and cloud technology can consolidate various data types into actionable insights. Thus, big data analysis is seen as an innovative approach poised to tackle upcoming challenges in sustainable farming.

Additionally, online platforms like Twitter, WeChat, and Google Search serve as rich sources of big data that can provide insights into various agricultural practices, including fertilization techniques and market trends for fertilizers and crops. The agricultural community is increasingly posting timely information related to nutrition, fertilization, yield quality, profitability, etc. Concurrently, these social media platforms also offer access to valuable insights into the expertise of seasoned producers, consumer preferences, and food market dynamics, all of which are beneficial for farmers' decision-making processes.
