The mutual exclusion problem seeks to design code that allows two threads to access a single-use resource simultaneously without any conflicts. Such a solution can be crafted using shared memory that allows atomic read and write operations, eliminating the need for other synchronization tools. A typical solution includes two parts: the entry protocol and the exit protocol, which enable each thread to safely enter and exit their critical sections, where the shared resource is accessed.

Next, the discussion focuses on proving a particular aspect of Theorem 4.5: the left-to-right implication. To do so, the paper initially aims to establish a definability result. It recalls that, for every completed interaction (play), you can construct a PA (process algebra) term associated with a strategy that is minimally inclusive yet still encompasses the interaction. However, this property does not hold for terms in a modified algebra denoted as IA||-. As a result, the paper sets out to demonstrate a reduced version of this result (stated in Lemma 5.2) specifically for IA||- terms, while also noting that a definitive closure characteristic of strategies linked to IA||- terms is revealed in the following section.
