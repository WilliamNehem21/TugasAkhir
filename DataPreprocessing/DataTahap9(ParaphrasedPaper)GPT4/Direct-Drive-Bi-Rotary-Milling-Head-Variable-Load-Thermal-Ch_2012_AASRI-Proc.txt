This paper examines the impact of thermal properties on the precision of machine tools, focusing on the bi-rotary milling head under various load conditions during the machining process. A CAD model of the bi-rotary milling head is constructed using SolidWorks and analyzed on the ANSYS platform to assess the head's temperature field under different motor power settings and load conditions. The analysis revealed how temperature changes across the A and C axes over time, providing a theoretical and technological foundation for designing high-grade CNC machines equipped with a direct drive.

The bi-rotary milling head is a critical component of 5-axis CNC milling machines, significantly influencing the machine's overall performance. This paper compares mechanical worm gear and worm drive milling heads with direct drive torque motor heads. The latter offers several advantages, including a more compact design, reduced weight, minimized transmission errors, improved machining accuracy, and lower mechanical failures due to high-speed transmission.

The bi-rotary milling head uses torque motors for direct drive. One motor enables the C-axis rotation via a gimbal mechanism, while the second motor, connected to the gimbal, facilitates the A-axis swing. Both torque motors are arranged in parallel installation. This setup negates the need for intermediate transmission components like gears or worms, enhancing structural simplicity and machining precision, while also lessening vibration, friction, and fatigue. The evolution of torque motor technology suggests a shift towards direct-drive milling heads over mechanical counterparts.
