This academic paper discusses the limitations of traditional methods in locating the edges of DM (Data Matrix) codes, which rely on geometric shape features and are prone to errors due to interference like scratches and noise. To overcome this problem, the paper introduces a new approach based on image gray projection for accurately positioning the DM code.

The method involves calculating the horizontal gray level projection of an image. Since any longitudinal displacement has already been corrected, image registration is only necessary in the x-direction. By analyzing the range of x, the maximum value of the matching function indicates both the optimal degree of match and the corresponding registration location, denoted as g.

The paper explores different module division styles denoted by {2n*2n|4n12} and introduces a mean based on the DM code boundary gradient projection. By evaluating all possible module division modes, the algorithm looks for a normal peak characteristic value that describes the result of each mode. The correct division mode's normal peak characteristic value is higher than that of incorrect modes, providing robustness against boundary pollution.

Distortion due to the cylindrical curve and rotational motion can lead to the horizontal width distortion of the DM code image. The approach involves calculating the horizontal gradient projection across different parts of the image (part0, part1, part2) to determine the complete number of horizontal modules (q) and their respective size (mq). By comparing the theoretical barcode module size (ms) with the actual size (m), the paper defines the distortion ratio of the DM code.

The algorithm places image part0 on the left side of a memory area and part2 on the right side. It then scans part1 with a vertical line, identifying the position of the maximum gradient. Part1 is then inserted between part0 and part2, and the overlapping columns are shifted until only one column overlaps. During this process, when the marked scanning line in part1 aligns with the dividing line of the memory area, the mean squared error (MSE) of the overlapping region is calculated. The position with the minimum MSE (MMSE) is chosen as the final registration position. The overlapping area, reduced to at most 10 columns, is then fused using a weighted average method. Finally, a mature decoding algorithm is applied to recognize the DM code in the buffered zone.
