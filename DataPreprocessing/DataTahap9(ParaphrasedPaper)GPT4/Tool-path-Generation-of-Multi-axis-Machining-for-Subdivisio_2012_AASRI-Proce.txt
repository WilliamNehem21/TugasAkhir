The paper presents a new algorithm for creating multi-axis NC (Numerical Control) tool-paths for subdivision surfaces. This algorithm comprises two primary stages: constructing the model and generating the tool-path. During model construction, the algorithm calculates a deformation vector that reflects the surface's curvature and the slope at the tool's contact points. This step ensures the resultant surface closely matches the intended design.

For the tool-path generation phase, a slicing technique is used to determine the points where the cutting tool will interact with the surface, known as cutter location (CL) points. The process also utilizes a method that reverses the coordinates conversion to aid in precise tool-path creation. The efficiency of the algorithm is demonstrated through practical machining examples that highlight its capability to minimize scallop height errors, which in turn improves the quality and precision of the machined surfaces. The algorithm is also noted for its computational efficiency and robustness.

The topic of designing and manufacturing free-form surfaces is crucial in modern product development. Traditional CAD/CAM systems define objects using parametric surface models like B-spline, Bezier, and NURBS. These are not ideal for machining free-from surfaces because they can result in non-smooth transitions, particularly where multiple patches meet, potentially causing gaps in complex models. These issues often necessitate additional splicing and trimming steps to correct.

Subdivision surfaces have gained popularity in geometric modeling because they can easily represent intricate multi-surface objects. They merge the benefits of parametric surface representation with polygon meshes, offering a powerful solution for creating smooth and unified designs. Current research has primarily addressed 3-axis machining of subdivision surfaces, with foundational work establishing their applicability in CAM. Subsequent studies have explored tool-path generation with loop subdivision and related techniques.

In this research, the focus is on the Catmull-Clark subdivision scheme, which is selected for its advantages in symmetrical object representation and its preference for quadrilateral-based meshes over triangular ones. The proposed algorithm leverages these properties to enhance tool-path generation for CNC machining applications, aiming to streamline the process from design to manufacturing.
