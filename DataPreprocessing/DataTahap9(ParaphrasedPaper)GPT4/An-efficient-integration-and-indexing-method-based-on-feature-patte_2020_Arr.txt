The emergence of digital data and communication networks has led to an abundant collection of data repositories accessible to the public. Efficient and accurate data extraction from these various sources is critical. Researchers have proposed models emphasizing the importance of integration and indexing in effective data mining and querying. Accurate learning models are necessary to associate and yield effective results from data, and this task is especially challenging when dealing with unstructured data.

Data integration is key for categorizing data within data mining and aims to deliver trusted data from diverse sources. This requires handling large, complex datasets with numerous dimensions and features. Traditional data integration methods face challenges arising from heterogeneity at schema and instance levels across different data sources, which complicates integration efforts.

This paper is outlined as follows: Section 2 discusses background studies. Section 3 presents the proposed methods for integration and indexing. Section 4 includes experimental evaluation and results, and Section 5 provides a summary of the proposed work.

Data integration systems must manage semantic uncertainties between data sources and their mediated schemas, which is crucial for constructing effective keyword-based indexing for data queries. Although some success has been achieved by tagging schema elements to understand feature mappings, challenges remain regarding dependable feature identification for accurate integration.

High-dimensional data, often containing redundant or correlated features, complicates the feature selection process in learning models, resulting in potential inefficiency or poor performance. Thus, developing methods for handling high-dimensional data, including feature selection and extraction, is necessary to enhance accuracy and reduce noise in the data.

When approaching feature selection, both supervised and unsupervised methods exist. Supervised methods use feature characteristics relationships to choose significant features, while unsupervised methods face difficulties due to the lack of feature information guidance. Semi-supervised selection aims to benefit from both labeled and unlabeled data, but it faces its own set of challenges in feature distinction in the absence of labels. Addressing the lack of labeled data and the rapid buildup of high-dimensional resources requires promising unsupervised feature selection technologies to support the integration process.

In unsupervised feature selection, information identifies feature subsets without labels, grouping them according to specific standards. Difficulties within this method are typically addressed using probabilistic models. This paper proposes a visual feature and user-specific class features for generative modeling, as well as a non-Gaussian method for feature selection, aimed at unsupporting data transformation and feature selection within data integration.

The paper also examines the integration and indexing of bibliometric data, with methods such as the modified feature vector selection (FVS) and an easily tunable version of support vector machines (SVMs) to select a small number of data points for analysis. An experimental analysis is conducted to compare the effectiveness of the suggested methods, including a focus on the limitations and potential of using Naive Bayes algorithms with big data.

Data from various technical article publishers acquired from the Information Extraction and Synthesis Laboratory (IESL) are processed and cleaned to facilitate feature transformation and selection. Semantic classification uses latent semantic relations discovered through singular value decomposition (SVD) to classify article data.

Integration and indexing performance are evaluated through experiments comparing traditional methods with the proposed approach. The proposed semantic data relation learning (SDRL) process and latent semantic analysis (LSA) methodologies aim to improve the grouping of data for integration and the accuracy of indexing for retrieval.
