The recent COVID-19 outbreak has necessitated significant adjustments to everyday life activities, with affected nations employing several strategies to mitigate the virus's spread, including effective measures such as social distancing. The concept of keeping a safe distance from others disrupts normal social interactions.

This paper is laid out in the following way: Section 2 discusses the background of indoor localization technology and GDPR-compliant access control methods. The proposed architecture for an Indoor Localization System (ILS) is presented in Section 3. Section 4 details the use cases for a museum visit, airport terminal navigation, and shopping assistance. Section 5 addresses the challenges of implementing an ILS in real-world settings, and Section 6 outlines the evaluation framework for this technology.

Technologies like Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), LTE, and Ultra-Wideband (UWB) are fundamental for maintaining social distancing through mobile applications that help trace contacts and manage queues. The paper introduces a reference architecture for an ILS that is modular, can be customized for different scenarios, and is privacy-centered in line with Europe's GDPR.

The proposed system has numerous benefits. It facilitates the tracking and measuring of physical distances indoors, potentially serving as a preventative measure against the spread of diseases. Section 4 explores the application of an ILS in practical scenarios, and highlights how standardization could promote smoother transitions between outdoor GPS systems and indoor localization.

A discovery process is essential for identifying services in a specific environment, globally via the web or locally through short-range networks like Wi-Fi Direct, Bluetooth, or LTE Direct. There are concerns about data privacy, considering the sensitivity of collecting personal data through location-based services, like contact tracing apps developed during the pandemic.

User interaction with the ILS is pivotal for its success. The aim is to replicate the intuitive user experience found in outdoor GPS systems within indoor settings. The creation of multimodal interfaces, such as messaging paradigms, can enhance user engagement with the ILS.

Core components of this architecture include a user agent for managing privacy and location discovery. A communication orchestrator facilitates the management of notifications using protocols like JMS, AMQP, or MQTT.

Collected social distance data can inform post-visit activities like cleaning schedules or crowd management. Challenges such as unpredictable visitor numbers in museums, varying services in airports, and product-specific layouts in shopping malls emphasize the need for effective ILS applications.

The paper also discusses map servers for providing indoor maps, the ILS engine that guides users, and discovery protocols to seamlessly connect users to the system. Additionally, consideration for client interfaces and technical solution guidelines are mentioned alongside the issues related to the practical adoption of ILS for measuring interpersonal distances, with a focus on privacy, trust, and the discoverability of the ILS.

The paper advocates for 'privacy by design' principles and data minimization to protect users. Interoperability, governance, and security verification tools are crucial for large-scale, reliable indoor localization systems that can combine various data and context information (data-fusion).

The paper concludes by questioning the long-term viability of smartphone app-based approaches for social distancing and suggests the transition towards infrastructure solutions like ILS. Environments play a role in self-enforcing social distancing, with open spaces allowing for easier self-judgment and confined indoor spaces necessitating automatic tools for safety.
