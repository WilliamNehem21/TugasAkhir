The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses the methods used for data preparation and pre-processing, as well as the defined tasks. Section 3 outlines the SVM classification framework as a general approach. Section 4 details the experimental results, contrasting them with previous findings from Candelieri et al. 2013. The paper concludes with a discussion of the conclusions drawn and outlines future research directions.

The paper revisits a decision support system from prior work that was designed to evaluate the structural integrity of helicopter fuselage panels, utilizing a structure of artificial neural networks (ANNs). While the original system was adequately dependable, the authors have explored the advantages of employing an SVM classification framework for two particular diagnostic tasks: detecting possible damage and identifying the specific components (bay or stringer) that have been impacted.
