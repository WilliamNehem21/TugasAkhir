The EU working group APPLIGRAPH is engaged in the ongoing development of standardized exchange formats for graphs and graph transformation systems. These formats are built on XML (eXtensible Markup Language), which enables the exchange of a wide variety of document types. By creating a common graph format, software developers can more easily collaborate on various applications, including graph layout, graph algorithms, and software reengineering.

The purpose of XML is to facilitate the structured exchange of documents and data, replacing earlier ASCII-based methods. XML documents, which are inherently tree-structured, must conform to a Document Type Definition (DTD) that outlines their abstract syntax. DTDs underpin XML's utility by defining grammars for document classes. XML Schemas, which are poised to offer an advanced alternative to DTDs, introduce features like unique namespaces, extendable types, and the capacity to define abstract elements.

Parsing XML documents is made possible by APIs like DOM (Document Object Model), which allows for manipulation of the logical document structure, and SAX (Simple API for XML), suitable for event-based parsing.

Graphs, a versatile data structure, need to accommodate various models across different contexts. Essential features for the exchange format include the ability to handle diverse graph types, such as directed, undirected, hypergraphs, or hierarchical graphs, as well as graph attributes. A proposed XML-based graph format, dubbed GXL (Graph eXchange Language), has been outlined, separate from SVG used for graphical representation.

The GXL format allows each graph element to carry a set of attributes with identified names, types, and values. Hierarchical graph structures can be represented in multiple ways, including refinement of elements or special edges, and even graphs as attribute values themselves.

Extending GXL to graph transformation systems results in the proposed GTXL format, essential for exchanging graph rules and associated structures among community tools focused on various aspects of graph transformation. GTXL supports grouping operations within control structures, rule-based operations with conditions, and negative application conditions.

GTXL aims to serve as a universal format across main graph transformation methodologies. Its design will likely be compared with RuleML, an AI-focused rule markup language.

The APPLIGRAPH initiative plans to solidify a core format by March 2001, with preliminary versions already in use within graph-based tools to leverage XML technologies. The aim is for these new human-readable XML-based formats to become widely adopted, significantly enhancing tool interoperability.
