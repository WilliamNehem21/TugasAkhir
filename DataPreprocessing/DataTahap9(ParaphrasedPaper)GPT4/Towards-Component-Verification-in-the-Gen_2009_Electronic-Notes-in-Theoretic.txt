The paper discusses specification formalisms, highlighting that their connections are generic and can be applied to many instantiations. The concept of a generic component is rooted in data type specification, particularly algebraic module specifications, and has been adapted for various algebraic specification techniques and other process description methods, including graph transformation systems, local action systems, and Petri nets.

The structure of the paper is outlined in the following manner: Section 2 introduces the foundational ideas and outcomes of the generic component concept at a high level of abstraction. Section 3 details how this concept is applied specifically to place/transition net systems and temporal logic. The paper concludes with a review of related research and the practical implications of this approach.

The introduction of Petri net components is discussed, detailing how the import interface of a component specifies needed resources, and the export interface defines the component's functionality that is available externally. The component's body fulfills the functions defined by the export interface using the resources from the import interface. Unlike previous models, the approach described herein simplifies morphisms and does not ensure the preservation of properties such as safety or liveness. The import morphism is plain and injective, indicating where the imported resources are used, while the export morphism is a T-partial and injective morphism, allowing for a broad interpretation of refinement.

The paper also notes that initial markings are not considered in this framework, as morphisms do not account for them. Thus, place/transition (PT) systems with the same net structure but different initial markings are considered isomorphic within the 'PTSP' category. Nevertheless, there is a unique marking for extension diagrams, as mentioned in Fact 3.4.
