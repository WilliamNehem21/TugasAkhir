The key contribution of the paper is the demonstration of the soundness and partial completeness of a type-checking algorithm. Partial completeness implies that the algorithm would only fail to terminate if there is some inherent recursion in the program being checked or its type, but not due to a flaw in the algorithm itself. This means once termination is established for a given pure type system (PTS), the algorithm is proven to be complete and can reliably decide the typing relation. The authors believe this characteristic is advantageous, as it allows them to confirm fundamental syntactic properties of the type-checking algorithm without relying on its termination.

The study begins by exploring the 'type:type' rule and analyzing some essential properties. Then, the researchers delineate the type-checking algorithm in a relational manner and validate its soundness using inductive reasoning. They ensure the algorithmâ€™s completeness through coinductive methods. They also provide a practical implementation in Haskell and suggest future directions to build upon their current findings.

In their Haskell implementation, evaluation is done lazily, with values represented as closures that are pairs of an expression and an environment. This setup manages free variables by assigning them unique identifiers, known as generic values. Environments can map variable names to either generic values or other closures.

When seeking the weak head normal form (WHNF) of a closure, the result could either be an introductory form like a type constructor or an abstraction or an application with generic values. The WHNF does not delve into function bodies, thereby simplifying the WHNF of function closures. Applications may generate redexes, which are resolved using a lazy (call by name) strategy.

Contexts are encapsulated within a monad that manages both the type and the value associated with each name, allowing the context to be extended with new types and values as needed. To type check a declaration, the algorithm first verifies the well-formedness of the type, evaluates it, checks the expression against the evaluated type, and then binds the name to the type and value within the current environment before proceeding.

Contexts are implemented as finite maps and manage fresh identifier generation, made possible by keeping track of the next available generic value. Contextual operations allow for searching, extending, and binding types and values to names.

The type-checking process needs to interact with the context and handle errors. The type-checking monad is a combination of a reader monad, which manages access to the context, and an error monad, which processes error handling. This approach abstracts away the details of static binding and allows for the shadowing of variable definitions seamlessly.
