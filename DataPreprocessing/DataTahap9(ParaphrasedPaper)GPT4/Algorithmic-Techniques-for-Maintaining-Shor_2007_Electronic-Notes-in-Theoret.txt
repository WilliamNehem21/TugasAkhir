In this paper, the authors provide a comprehensive review of recent advances in algorithms designed to determine and maintain the shortest paths within dynamic networks—networks where connections and weights may change over time. The scope of the survey is broad, covering algorithms that address the all-pairs shortest paths (APSP) problem, which involves finding shortest paths between every pair of nodes in a graph. These cutting-edge techniques have potential implications for both specific and more general network scenarios.

Dynamic graph algorithms are focused on preserving certain properties despite network alterations like the addition or removal of edges or adjustments to edge weights. Efficient algorithms can process related queries rapidly and apply updates more swiftly than recomputing the entire network data from scratch. Fully dynamic algorithms handle both insertions and deletions of edges, whereas partially dynamic algorithms are limited to just one of these operations: incremental algorithms solely support insertions, and decremental algorithms exclusively accommodate deletions.

Although the study of dynamic shortest path algorithms has a history of over three decades, the field has experienced revitalized interest and innovation in the last few years. The paper aims to distill the essence of the newest algorithms by identifying key combinatorial and algebraic principles as well as shared data structure strategies that underpin these methods. This approach seeks to present the latest findings in a coherent framework that can be easily understood and applied, even by those not specializing in the field.

Historically, few dynamic shortest path algorithms were faster than recalculating APSP for every update, and these were limited to specific situations and small integer weights. However, recent algorithms have made significant advances. The authors cite examples, such as an incremental APSP algorithm for directed graphs with positive integers weights by Ausiello et al., and fully dynamic algorithms designed for APSP in planar graphs with integer weights by Henzinger et al., as well as for single-source shortest paths in planar directed graphs by Fakcharoenphol and Rao.

The structure of the paper is outlined as follows: Section 2 details the combinatorial aspects of directed graph path problems and introduces essential algorithmic data structures. Section 3 dives into the latest dynamic shortest path algorithms. Finally, Section 4 concludes with a summary and discussion of open questions in the field.

The paper also references a property previously mentioned in literature, used to design algorithms for transitive closure and shortest paths, along with a theorem establishing the utility of locally shortest paths—paths that are shortest within their local vicinity—to compute and maintain graph distances even as the graph changes. It presents an algorithm by King that leverages certain data structures and properties to maintain APSP with non-negative integer edge weights in a directed graph, achieving efficient update times. This algorithm involves maintaining trees using the data structures discussed, which are adjusted to encompass weighted directed graphs and include only paths up to a certain length.

This survey promises to be a valuable resource for understanding the state-of-the-art in dynamic shortest path algorithms and may help practitioners implement these new techniques in a variety of applications.
