The paper describes the creation of a novel fractional two dimensional triangle function combination discrete chaotic map (2D-TFCDM) based on discrete fractional calculus. This new map displays chaotic behaviors when analyzed numerically in a fractional-order difference context. The study provides evidence of chaos through bifurcation diagrams, Lyapunov exponent calculations, and phase portraits.

The authors demonstrate the application of this new map by incorporating it into an elliptic curve cryptosystem, which is known for its efficiency in public key cryptography and particularly advantageous for devices with limited computational power. The elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) technique leverages the properties of elliptic curves over finite fields for secure data encryption, while being resource-efficient in storage and power consumption.

The paper is structured in several sections, starting with an introduction of elliptic curves in finite fields, followed by an explanation of the Menezes-Vanstone elliptic curve cryptosystem (MVECC). It then introduces the fractional 2D-TFCDM and standard map, showing their complex dynamical behavior through bifurcation, Lyapunov, and phase portraits analysis.

The authors apply the fractional 2D-TFCDM to image encryption in conjunction with MVECC, presenting the process and results. A specific elliptic curve (with parameters a=1, b=6 over the field F100927) is chosen for its cryptographic safety, and an example is provided with specific values for the curve parameters and secret key to illustrate the encryption process.

The paper concludes that discrete fractional calculus (DFC) is an effective method to create fractional versions of discrete maps, which can be useful in secure image transmission. This research is original, as it claims that no other studies have been reported on information security in the context of fractional difference. The benefits of fractional calculus methods and fractional discrete formulas are recognized as potential avenues for a better understanding of discrete fractional dynamics in the future.
