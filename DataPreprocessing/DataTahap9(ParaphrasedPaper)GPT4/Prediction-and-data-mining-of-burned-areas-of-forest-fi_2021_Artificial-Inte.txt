The propagation of wildfires is determined by a multitude of meteorological and environmental factors such as local climate, terrain, and vegetation type and density. These factors significantly affect wildfire behavior and its extensive consequences on agriculture, ecology, environments, and forestry.

Wildfire spread rate is influenced by complex, nonlinear dynamics involving variables such as wind patterns and fuel characteristics. Fuel bed condition and geometry, as well as wind-driven firebrands, dictate fire development and spread. The permeability of the litter layer beneath vegetation, especially in broadleaf forests, is critical because it moderates wind-induced convection through the fuel.

Advanced computational models, incorporating methods like genetic algorithms, and incorporating wind and environmental data, have been developed for wildfire prediction. These models analyze data through various approaches, some using convolutional neural networks for spatial prediction, and others using neuro-fuzzy inference systems for classifying hotspots. Careful feature selection is required when dealing with complex datasets with non-linear variables; in highly skewed data, extreme values can majorly influence outcomes.

The total burn area (TBA) distributions are often positively skewed, making Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) a more effective optimization metric over Mean Absolute Error (MAE), although MAE offers its own unique insights. The Transparent Open Box (TOB) model's accuracy compares well against other machine learning approaches while offering additional transparency and forensic examination into prediction components, aiding in data mining and providing more profound ecological insights.

The TOB model's transparency allows for detailed comparisons between fire events, enhancing prediction accuracy, and revealing model limitations due to the skewness in burn area data. This approach surfaces important information about influential factors for each fire incident's prediction, aiding in making informed decisions.

An optimized data-matching machine learning algorithm predicted TBA for a Portuguese forest fire dataset with high accuracy and provided clear insights into each fire event. The TOB model, through its transparent approach, offers a marked benefit over regression-based algorithms, as it avoids assumptions common to regression and statistical methods.

The TOB model's feature selection highlighted the importance of drought code and relative humidity variables. The use of RMSE and MAE as separate objectives helps fine-tune predictions for positively skewed distributions. Graphical error analysis aids in identifying issues within prediction models, helping to improve response strategies to fire events and limit future damage.

The proposed method, focused on transparent and optimized data matching, can be adapted beyond regression methods for predicting and understanding complex agricultural systems influenced by the interplay of weather and environmental conditions.
