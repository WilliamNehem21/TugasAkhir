The use of assistive robots is expanding, with an increasing need for these robots to interact with their environment for tasks such as opening doors, pulling drawers, and serving tea. These interactions often involve handling unknown constrained mechanisms without predefined task descriptions.

Manipulating unknown mechanisms is complex, as tasks like opening a door involve challenges in positioning, trajectory planning, and motion tracking. Traditional methods typically require modeling the mechanisms for trajectory planning, which isn't a universal solution, as each task has unique requirements. Existing research in this area includes various approaches, each with limitations such as inaccurate modeling, high failure rates, or increased controller complexity. These challenges emphasize the need for model-free methods that can handle resistance variations in mechanisms.

In this study, five experiments were conducted to test a new dynamic interactive control method, contrasting it with traditional impedance control in Experiment I. This new method includes a dynamic velocity approach in Experiments III and IV. During door-opening, the paper assumes slow arm speed, neglecting the mass (m) and damping (d) in impedance control and focusing on the stiffness (k) with values set to 4.0 N/mm. Similarly, rotational mass (m_rot) in attitude impedance control is considered negligible, and the doorknob's orientation is to be followed in real-time with no rotational stiffness (k_rot) and a damping (d_rot) of 1.9 Nms/rad.

The study references the academic background of a researcher from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, who received his M.Phil and Ph.D. degrees in automation & computer-aided engineering. After spending time as a postdoctoral fellow and research assistant, he became a professor in the Department of Automation at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. His research includes visual servoing and robot control. A senior IEEE member and associate editor for multiple journals, he has organized international conferences, showcasing his active engagement in robotics research and development.
