This paper examines the monotonicity characteristics of plural determiners when they quantify over collections, building on the approach of using generalized quantifiers from previous research. By introducing a type-shifting operator, it extends the standard use of determiners like "all," "some," and "most" to collective interpretations. Unlike other theories, it presents a single "determiner fitting" operator that handles existential quantification for plural determiners while also maintaining their monotonicity properties.

However, the study notes that the expected monotonicity of plural determiners can be disrupted when they interact with collective predicates. The proposed determiner fitting operator is shown to accurately reflect this behavior, and the monotonicity of derived collective determiners is characterized. The findings demonstrate that while the determiner fitting preserves monotonicity in the second argument of determiners, the monotonicity in the first argument is preserved only if the determiner is monotonic in the same direction in both arguments.

The paper addresses a gap in the formal study of monotonicity and collectivity in natural language semantics, particularly the impact of collective interpretations on monotonicity. It introduces a novel operator for collectivity that synthesizes concepts from previous studies and shows that the natural language principle of conservativity is responsible for certain asymmetries in the monotonicity properties of collective determiners.

The study observes that some determiners maintain their monotonicity when quantifying over collections, such as "some," which remains upward left monotone even when paired with collective predicates. The paper also discusses how the denotation of determiner expressions varies depending on the domain and defines global and local determiners based on this characteristic.

The paper delves into the details of how counting members of collections involves two steps – conservativity and participation – and explains the role of a powerset operator as a sufficient tool for handling distributive predicates when mapping to predicates over sets of atoms.

It concludes that determiners like "all" and "not all," which are monotone in one argument but not the other, lose their left monotonicity under a "count" operator. In contrast, determiners with similar monotonicities in both arguments, such as "some" and "no," do not lose this characteristic. Right monotonicity and non-monotonicity are preserved. The exceptional monotonicity properties of collective determiners, the paper asserts, are due to the counting process involved in collective quantification, rather than the existential nature of the determiner fitting operator itself.
