In this paper, the authors propose a model to effectively monitor and forecast the trend of China's Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) using a combination of wavelet analysis, intervention analysis, and time series analysis. The purpose of this model is to help the government track economic indicators and formulate well-informed policies. Wavelet analysis is employed to remove noise that could distort predictions, while the ARIMA-GARCH-M model captures autocorrelation and time-varying volatility characteristics of financial time series data. Simulation outcomes indicate that this model successfully captures the dynamic patterns of FDI in China.

The paper underscores how FDI is a crucial avenue for acquiring advanced technology and expertise, thereby alleviating economic funding shortages, attracting technology and talent flows, and fostering sustainable, robust, and healthy national economic growth. Accurate quantitative analysis and forecasts of FDI, combined with risk calculation and management, can significantly enhance the economic benefits.

Previous studies are reviewed, including work by Jing Ma and Guoqing Zhao in 2009, indicating that China's FDI does not exhibit chaos theory's chaotic attractors, and a 2011 study by Chunlin Li and Huiyan Wang on the impact of the Asian financial crisis on Hebei Province using an intervention-ARIMA model. These foundational studies highlight the challenges of identifying nonlinear patterns in FDI data due to its complexity and the limited scale of available data.

In developing the proposed dynamic model for China's FDI, the authors apply advances in ARIMA-ARCH models, intervention models, and wavelet theory to remove random fluctuations and noise for better prediction accuracy. The model is also designed to account for the impact of unexpected events using the intervention model approach. An analysis of China's FDI from 1985 to 1997 is conducted, utilizing wavelet threshold de-noising to process the data and remove noise.

However, the paper notes that this is a preliminary study with a limited scope, touching only on FDI's actual changes. Further research should encompass multivariate time series analysis to incorporate the influence of additional factors like foreign trade structure, which could facilitate more precise predictions of China's FDI trends.
