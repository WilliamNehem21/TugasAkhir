In many practical engineering and economic scenarios, the data used for decision-making are imprecise. This paper focuses on the generalized production planning problem when dealing with such interval data—data that can vary within certain ranges—in both the objective function and the constraints. Previous studies on the qualitative and quantitative properties of essential concepts in the parametric production planning problem, such as feasible parameter sets, solvability, and stability, are extended upon in this work.

Given the limits of production resources that cannot be carried over from one period to the next, production planning must address which resources to use, how to represent their capacity and behavior, their costs, and the uncertainty surrounding the production functions and limitations. The planning process begins by determining customer demand, which may focus on critical or bottleneck resources or include multiple resources when there is no clear single constraining factor.

Hax and Meal put forth a hierarchical production planning methodology with an optimization model for various hierarchy levels, each imposing restrictions on the subsequent level.

In most scenarios, customer demand forecasts are uncertain, leading to inaccuracies. This inaccuracy can result in unmet demand and revenue loss. The authors of this paper propose a new production planning challenge aimed at minimizing lost demand and maximizing revenue. They construct a production planning model that incorporates interval data uncertainties in the objective function and constraints. They then address the uncertainty in both components. The paper includes a parametric study to treat the problem of uncertainty and presents a numerical example to illustrate the approach.
