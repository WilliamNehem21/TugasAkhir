Certified Email with a Mandatory Trustworthy Third Party: An Academic Study Overview

Certified Email (CEM) protocols form a distinctive subset of fair exchange protocols, which aim to ensure fairness by offering non-repudiable proofs of transaction completion. Fairness, loosely defined, means that at the conclusion of a successful protocol execution, both parties should have received all necessary evidences, or neither party should have received any at all. The use of a Trusted Third Party (TTP) is a common approach to provide indisputable evidence of a sender's submission and a recipient's receipt; however, the TTP can become a point of congestion if it is required for an excessive number of CEM transactions.

The protocol we propose is structured around three key components: an exchange sub-protocol for delivering emails and exchanging undeniable proofs, an abort sub-protocol for situations where the process needs to be halted, and a recover sub-protocol for addressing complications. These sub-protocols enable communication parties to perform exchanges—deemed protocol rounds—or a collection of rounds within an initiation phase, known as a protocol session, which is exclusive to each pair of communicating parties.

In our framework, the TTP's behavior is specifically modeled to ensure impartiality and prevent collusion with other parties involved in the protocol. We have constructed a model for TTP operations that adhere to this stringent requirement.

Recognizing the essential nature of formal verification for security protocols, due to the severe ramifications of security weaknesses, this paper employs model checking as an automated tool to verify that the proposed CEM protocol models satisfy predefined specifications. Past literature on formal verifications of CEM protocols, including works by Kremer et al., Cederquist et al., and Abadi and Blanchet, informed our analysis.
