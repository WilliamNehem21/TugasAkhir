In this paper, the authors discuss an analysis tool developed for assessing the resource consumption of Java Virtual Machine (JVM) bytecode. This tool applies the principles of amortised complexity analysis and separation logic, establishing on previous work by Robert Atkey. This approach allows for the analysis of programs that manipulate complex heap-based data structures like trees and linked lists.

The paper outlines the theoretical foundation of the analysis, followed by a comprehensive description of how Java annotations are used to specify resource usage to the analyzer. These annotations, provided by the programmer within the Java source code, are necessary for the tool to assess the bytecode effectively.

The authors provide examples to illustrate the analyzer's effectiveness and detail the implementation approach, which involved creating the analyzer using OCaml and processing class files through a custom internal representation that is suited for the analysis.

The paper also addresses some challenges encountered, such as specifying loop invariants due to Java's inability to include annotations directly in the code. To solve this, the authors devised a system of loop identifiers that could be associated with the corresponding invariants.

The authors acknowledge that the current implementation supports only linked lists and trees, and express a desire to expand this to more complex and varied data structures, potentially including those found in the standard Java API. Furthermore, recognition is given to the realization that the analyzer is limited to linear bounds on resource usage, but they suggest the possibility of future advancements that may extend its capabilities to analyze non-linear bounds.

In conclusion, the paper describes the successful creation of a static analysis tool for JVM bytecode based on amortised complexity analysis and separation logic, while recognizing the potential for further improvements and wider applicability.
