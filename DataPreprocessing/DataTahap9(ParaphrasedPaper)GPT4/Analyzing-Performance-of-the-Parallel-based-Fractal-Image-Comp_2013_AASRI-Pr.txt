The academic paper discusses how the increasing size and resolution of images are important considerations in the field of computer graphics, particularly in this age of big data where large volumes of data are often exchanged over networks with limited bandwidth or stored on devices with restricted memory capacity. This paper highlights the use of the fractal method for compressing images, a technique that can significantly reduce file sizes but is also known for its time-consuming processing.

To address the inefficiency of the method, the researchers developed a model that uses parallel processing to harness the capabilities of multiprocessor systems, thereby speeding up the fractal encoding process. The study tested this new parallel approach with images of various sizes on two machines, one with a dual-core processor and the other with a quad-core processor.

The results of the study showed that performance improvements in terms of speed and efficiency strongly depend on the number of processor cores available. Notably, simply increasing the number of threads does not always lead to better performance.

The paper details the fractal image compression (FIC) technique and introduces a new thread-based model for parallelizing the encoding phase of the FIC method. In addition to designing the model, the researchers developed a prototype and evaluated it using different image sizes and machines with varying numbers of processing cores, specifically examining the performance on dual-core and quad-core machines.
