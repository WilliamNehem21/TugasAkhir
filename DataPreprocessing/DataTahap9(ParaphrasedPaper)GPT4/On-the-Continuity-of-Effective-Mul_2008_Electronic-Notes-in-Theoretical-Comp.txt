In this paper, the authors elaborate on the concept of multifunctions within the context of applied mathematics, logic, and theoretical computer science. Multifunctions, which map elements to sets of possible outputs, are commonplace and instrumental in these fields, leading to significant research and literature available on the topic.

The paper discusses the various methods used to represent (code or index) sets and introduces the concept of effective continuity for multifunctions. The researchers propose several continuity notions for multifunctions and demonstrate that for each continuity concept, a corresponding system for indexing sets can be determined. Within this system, multifunctions that are considered effective are those that also have specific "witness functions" and are thus deemed effectively continuous according to the respective continuity notion.

Moreover, the paper covers particular instances where these witness functions are guaranteed to exist, contributing to the theoretical understanding of multifunction behavior.

In the context of set theory, the authors note that inclusion between basic open sets is usually not fully enumerable. However, for practical purposes, there is often a canonical relationship between the descriptions of these sets (or their numerical representations) that is more robust than plain set inclusion. This relationship is recursively enumerable. The authors assume the availability of a numbered topological basis with a corresponding relationship between the codes for these basis elements.

The paper also delves into effectiveness properties in \(T_0\) spaces, where essential elements like points and basic open sets need to be assigned numerical indices. However, due to cardinality constraints, not all subspaces can be indexed.

Lastly, by applying certain theorems and lemmas cited in the paper, it is shown that for compact-valued multifunctions that are effectively based on complete covering indices and are within a metric space, both lower and upper semi-continuity are effectively present.

The research presented aims to provide a more thorough understanding of multifunctions and their continuity properties through effective indexing, thereby advancing the field's theoretical framework.
