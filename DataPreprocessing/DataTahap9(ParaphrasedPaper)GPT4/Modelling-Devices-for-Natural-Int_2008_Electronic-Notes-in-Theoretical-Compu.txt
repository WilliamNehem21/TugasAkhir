This paper explores how formal notations and models can describe the interaction between users and physical devices, emphasizing the importance of considering our physical nature in these models. It discusses the process of pressing, twisting, or pulling a physical control and the resulting effects on a system, such as bounce back in sprung buttons. The paper uses state diagrams to model these interactions and extends them to encapsulate complex features.

The authors highlight the usefulness of analyzing everyday artifacts like electric kettles or outdated media controllers. They hypothesize that devices that are easy to learn and use likely incorporate the designers' intuitive understanding of natural interaction, which can be unearthed through detailed examination.

Feedback from devices can be physical, like force feedback, or non-physical, like indicator lights. The feedback can feel integral to the device due to spatial and temporal proximity.

Interaction with a device involves a semantic feedback loop; physical actions change the logical state within a system, which then manifests as visual or auditory changes, like a new track number on an LCD. This loop can give the impression of directly manipulating virtual objects when it's rapid enough. Some systems also elicit physical changes in the environment, such as turning on a light or starting a washing machine.

The paper acknowledges that the type of physical interaction with a device, like a light switch, depends on its current state, which is normally obvious to users.

Feedback from a system isn't always immediate or visible, as in the case of lights that take time to turn on or external security systems. In some instances, the feedback inherent to the physical device might be the only immediate indication of its effect.

The relationship between user actions and system states is complex and not one-to-one; different actions can result in various states, and not all user actions produce a change in the system. For devices with exposed states, users are typically able to completely control the states within the device's physical limits.

When extending the models to encompass bounce-back effects, labels like 'Z' (for "zebedee", as used in the example) indicate the release of user-induced tension. Representing these tensions highlights design considerations like the appropriate use of tension states.

Standard notations such as state-charts can be used for simple relationships between the physical and logical, but complex properties like bounce-back require extensions to these notations to capture additional effects, revealing insights into design challenges.
