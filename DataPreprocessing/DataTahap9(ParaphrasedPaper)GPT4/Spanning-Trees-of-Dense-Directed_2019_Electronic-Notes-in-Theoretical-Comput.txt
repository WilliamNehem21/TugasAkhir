In this excerpt from an academic paper, the authors discuss certain properties of trees—a type of graph that does not contain cycles—and how these properties relate to their presence within digraphs (directed graphs) with higher semi-degrees. Here's a paraphrased summary:

We can demonstrate using the second moment method that nearly all trees fulfill condition (ii) from Theorem 2.2. This evidence, in conjunction with Theorem 2.3, leads us to conclude that nearly all trees are present in any digraph with a sufficiently large semi-degree.

To further elaborate on these findings, we illustrate how Theorem 2.1 can be derived from Theorem 2.2. We begin by defining certain concepts and introducing a lemma. We define a path decomposition P of a tree T as a set of non-overlapping subpaths covering every edge of T exactly once. We say that P is 'bare' if each subpath in P is also 'bare', meaning that paths can only intersect at their endpoints. We denote by P(T) the minimum number of paths needed for a bare path decomposition of tree T, and by L(T) the count of leaf nodes in T. For instance, P(T) would be 1 for a linear path, whereas for a star-shaped tree P(T) would equal L(T). We then present a lemma that, while not detailed here, is presumably straightforward to prove.

The authors continue by recalling that Theorem 2.2 outlines two possible structural scenarios for a tree T. The proving techniques for each scenario differ, yet bear resemblances in approach. To simplify the ensuing discussion, it is assumed that tree T corresponds to scenario (i) from Theorem 2.2.
