The study involved assessing the antioxidant capability of various chemical compounds by determining their ability to scavenge the DPPH (2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) free radical. Samples of the compounds were prepared at concentrations ranging from 6.25 to 200 mg/mL in methanol. An assay was conducted by adding 50 ÂµL of each concentration to 5 mL of a 0.004% DPPH solution in methanol. The solutions were left to stand for 60 minutes in darkness before measuring their absorbance at 517 nm against a blank sample to determine the IC50 value, which is the concentration at which the compound inhibits 50% of the DPPH radical's color.

For theoretical calculations, the study utilized the DMol3 program within the Materials Studio software suite, applying density functional theory (DFT) methods. The calculations incorporated double numerical basis sets with polarization (DNP), which are suggested to be of similar quality to 6-31G Gaussian basis sets and believed to offer greater accuracy. The research employed the RPBE functional, a form of the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA), which considers electron exchange-correlation effects, and conducted geometric optimizations without imposing symmetry constraints.

The study found that compounds with lower HOMO (Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital) energies were less effective at donating electrons, while those with higher HOMO energies were better electron donors. Additionally, the LUMO (Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital) energy levels indicated the compounds' ability to accept electrons.

In examining the coordination behavior of a mercury complex with a ligand known as H2TAET, the research observed changes in the 1H NMR spectrum; specifically, the signal for the (NH)B proton vanished and a new signal at 10.49 ppm appeared, attributable to an SH group. Additionally, a shift in the signal of the thiazole proton was interpreted as supporting the coordination.
