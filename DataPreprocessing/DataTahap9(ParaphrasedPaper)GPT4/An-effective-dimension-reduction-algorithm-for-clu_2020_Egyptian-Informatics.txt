To develop an accurate and efficient text clustering algorithm, one must address the challenges posed by the high-dimensional nature of text data. Dimensionality reduction is vital in this context as it helps to eliminate irrelevant features or "noise" that can hamper the clustering process. Effective clustering algorithms work by distilling the core themes of the text, reducing data dimensionality, and thus improving performance.

One common dimensionality reduction approach involves Principal Component Analysis (PCA). This method applies to the original data matrix, X, by computing its eigen decomposition based on the covariance matrix, or more practically by using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to decompose X into component matrices. PCA helps in identifying the main axes or "principal components" of the dataset, and by projecting the data onto a smaller subspace, it retains the most significant variance observed in the original data. Additionally, applying a whitening transformation as part of PCA standardizes the variances to one, further refining the data by removing noise.

In the context of this research, documents are represented as vectors in a term-document matrix where each column corresponds to a document and each row represents a unique term. A document vector contains weighted term frequencies that indicate the importance of each term within that document.

The study specifically examines a subset of the Reuters 21578 dataset, consisting of news articles classified into 135 topics. The author selects 10 categories from this dataset and excludes any overlapping documents, resulting in a collection of 7293 documents across 10 categories with 18933 unique terms.

The researcher conducts standard preprocessing techniques for both Arabic and English corpora, which include the removal of stopwords, application of appropriate stemming algorithms (light stemmer for Arabic and Porter stemmer for English), and the implementation of the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) weighting scheme to construct the term-document matrix for each corpus. These preprocessing steps are crucial for refining the dataset and preparing it for effective clustering.
