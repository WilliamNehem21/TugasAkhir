The current surge in incorporating information and communication technology (ICT) into agriculture holds great promise for enhancing the productivity and decision-making processes for farmers and benefiting consumers as well. However, integrating advanced technology into the rural sector faces multiple obstacles. This paper conducts a comprehensive review of recent research efforts and academic publications, with a key focus on the European Union (EU), to identify achieved outcomes, ongoing research, and persistent challenges, both in terms of technology and its broader implications.

Smart farming (SF) involves the use of ICT tools in farming practices. Collecting and analyzing data through ICT can make agricultural production more efficient. Technologies such as satellite imagery, agricultural robots, extensive sensor networks, and drones are at the forefront of this transformation in accordance with the EU's vision expressed in the 2019 declaration on digital agriculture. Despite the progress, rural areas still suffer from connectivity issues, which hampers the implementation of SF technologies. Initiatives like the EU-funded Smart AKIS aim to bridge the gap between science and practical farming by enabling ICT-based solutions that improve farming practices, reduce environmental impact, and might also enhance work safety.

Farmers often view SF as beneficial mainly for large holdings due to the perceived high costs and complexity associated with implementing such technologies. However, there are opportunities for smaller and more affordable technologies to make SF accessible to all farm sizes.

This paper surveys research projects and scientific literature on SF to understand recent technologies and techniques, discusses ongoing challenges, and provides a structure for the paper: Section 2 examines SF projects in the EU and expands to the scientific literature; Section 3 discusses open challenges, technical and non-technical; and Section 4 concludes and suggests future research directions.

It highlights noteworthy projects improving the use of satellite data, introduces robots and drones in agricultural applications, emphasizes the importance of real-time data processing for automated farming, and examines the role of big data analytics in generating actionable insights from the collected data. The paper also considers the shift from centralized cloud computing to edge computing to reduce delays in decision-making, the relevance of open standards in building sustainable infrastructure, and the crucial role of farmers in controlling data usage.

In conclusion, while significant progress has been made in promoting ICT in EU agriculture, challenges remain in maximizing technology adoption, ensuring interoperability, and addressing the digital divide. Notable references include Gao et al.'s work on interoperability, and Soto et al.'s study of factors influencing the adoption of precision agricultural technologies.
