In the realm of physical sciences, the concept of voltage is analogous to various physical forces and gradients, including radiation pressure, water levels, gas pressure, temperature differences, and, in the context of chemistry, concentration differences that drive reactions. Similarly, the concept of current in electricity finds equivalence in flows of radiation, water, gas, heat, and chemical reaction products. Based on these comparisons, the idea of electrical resistance (or conductivity) can be extended to describe the opposition to flow in physical and chemical systems, also taking into account material properties and geometries.

For biological populations and individuals, environmental pressures like food availability, safety, and habitat conditions can be considered analogous to the driving voltage in an electrical system, while responses to these pressures are like the electrical current. The system's condition and behavioral responses can thus be thought of as inputs and outputs of matter, energy, or information.

Cognitive and psychological systems in humans serve as a monitoring mechanism, with inputs coming from external (physical, biological, and social) and internal environments. Outputs, dependent on memory and evaluation, feed back into the decision-making process and influence behaviors. While complex and multi-dimensional, the application of extended parameters in these systems has practical significance.

From a systems theory standpoint, assimilation refers to the adjustments a system makes in response to changes. The scope of assimilation might be confined to self-organizing systems, whether biological, social, or economic. Changes within these systems may be transient or localized, but persistent changes in external conditions can result in profound shifts in the relationship between structure and function.

Theoretical implications of the assimilation principle consider its economical value and categorize structural changes into regularity or stability, randomness, and assimilation itself. The role of feedback is universal in biological systems, supporting the adaptation to environmental shifts. The assimilation principle could help provide scientific explanations for such adaptations.

At the cellular and genetic level, environmental influences both internal and external may affect gene expression and regulation. Understanding mechanisms at this level can reconcile Darwinian natural selection with Lamarckian adaptive evolution, offering a common platform for research into species adaptation and survival.

In essence, the assimilation principle could offer a new scientific direction for understanding the formation and evolution of species. It recognizes how life evolves through various assimilation strategies in response to environmental changes, potentially leading to a more mature understanding of evolutionary processes.

Cognitive systems, including the brain, undergo internal assimilation changes in response to external parameters, affecting the environment in a feedback loop that might promote specific cognitive advancements.

Social systems adapt through assimilation across a broad front, where significant changes in external parameters can force structural alterations. These changes in system structure can lead to stresses within the system that, if unresolved, might disrupt the system's cohesion.

In systems theory, health corresponds to the robustness and stability of human regulatory functions, influenced partially by external factors. Thus, moderate exposure to stressors, like exercise or controlled exposure to harmful agents (such as in immunotherapy), can be employed to maintain or enhance health.
