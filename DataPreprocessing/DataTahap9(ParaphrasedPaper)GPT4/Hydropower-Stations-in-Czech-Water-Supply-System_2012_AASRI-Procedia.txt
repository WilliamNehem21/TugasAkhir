Globally, there is an ongoing effort to ensure reliable electricity access for industrial and residential needs. As electricity demand rises and fossil fuel prices increase, and given the resistance to nuclear power in some regions, boosting renewable energy production has emerged as a solution to the energy dilemma. Hydroelectric power, an eco-friendly option, doesn't pollute the air or damage landscapes through mining and transportation. It also avoids waste, reduces the need for raw material imports, and enhances safety. Hydro power plants offer flexible energy output and energy storage capabilities, which improve power network efficiency and reliability.

In the Czech Republic (CR), the geographical conditions are not ideal for large-scale hydroelectric projects due to streams lacking sufficient water flow and elevation. Consequently, hydroelectric power contributes minimally to the overall electricity production in the CR. Like wind energy, there's limited potential for expansion, relegating hydro power to a supporting role in the energy mix. However, the development of more small-scale hydroelectric power stations could be beneficial, as they would utilize local resources and offer a more dependable and cost-effective alternative to wind power.

The growth of small hydropower stations (SHSs) in the CR has been fueled by government incentives such as purchase price subsidies, grants, and low-interest loans. These plants, typically with installed capacities under 10 MW, are increasingly numerous. Enhancing hydroelectric output could involve modernizing existing plants or developing new ones, although low-head locations may challenge investment returns.

Even though the CR hosts many water treatment facilities incorporating SHSs, the overall contribution of these facilities to electricity production is not well-documented, and there are no comprehensive statistics for SHS-generated electricity. Available data indicates that individual SHS can produce over 90 MWh per year when integrated into reservoirs and up to 2.5 GWh in water treatment plants, with dozens of SHSs present within water supply systems.

In support of renewable energy, Czech legislation mandates power distributors to connect any renewable source to the grid. The Energy Regulatory Office sets the price for electricity from these sources, ensuring a legally guaranteed minimum purchase price for a duration of 15 years with an option for an annual increase of up to 5%.
