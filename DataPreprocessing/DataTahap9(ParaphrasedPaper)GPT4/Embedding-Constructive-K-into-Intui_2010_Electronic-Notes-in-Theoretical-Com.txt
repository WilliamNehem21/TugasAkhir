We examine a method of translating natural deduction proofs in CK (Contractionless K) logic into proofs in IK (Intuitionistic K) logic. Both CK and IK are intuitionistic versions of the classical modal logic K. Typically, these logics employ different proof techniques, so our translation aims to bridge the gap between them. Moreover, we demonstrate that this translation can be extended to the logics CS4 and IS4. We propose a unifying framework for these systems, supporting a modular approach to handle different intermediate systems between CK and IS4.

Modal logic's proof theories are challenging due to the diverse forms modal logic can take. Various proposals offer possible solutions, but creating a modular and comprehensive framework for modal logic remains complicated.

Our paper is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces NCK and NIK natural deduction systems and their properties; Section 3 demonstrates that the modal rules of NCK can be considered derived rules in NIK â€“ meaning NCK proofs can be embedded into NIK proofs; In Section 4, we extend this connection to CS4 and IS4; and in Section 5, we propose a modular approach for all systems from CK to IS4.

Rule 2.4 clarifies the four rules for handling modal operators. Under standard possible world semantics, a formula A holds in a world w if A holds in all accessible worlds v from w. The (I) rule states that if A holds in any accessible world v from w, then A holds in w. The (E) rule implies if A holds in w, then A holds in any accessible world v from w.

In Rule 2.7, we note the (I) and (E) rules require that world v must not occur in the rule's conclusion. To prove this, we use a substitution lemma.

We then prove that CK is a subset of IK by showing that NCK's modal rules are derived rules in NIK. This provides a previously unnoticed translation from CK proofs to IK proofs.

In Example 4.1, we demonstrate how additional rules apply by showing derivations of the (4) axiom scheme in NCS4 and NIS4. The NIS4 derivation may be obtained through our embedding from the corresponding NCS4 derivation, which is also true for other axiom schemes like (4, T, T).

Our paper assembles observations on two types of natural deduction systems for intuitionistic modal logics, termed C-systems and I-systems. C-systems like NCS4 in Section 4 incorporate many features within single rules, impeding modular approaches. By taking a different approach, it's possible to establish a modular class of C-systems. Although adding an extra rule for each modal axiom appears burdensome, the translation to I-systems offers theoretical justification and acts as a sanity check.

As mentioned in Remark 3.6, despite I-systems accommodating detailed analysis of C-systems, they might be less adaptable. The translation indicates restricting relational assumptions could be explored, though it's uncertain how to handle certain axiom schemes like (D0, D2). Future research plans include investigating a way to transform I-system derivations into C-system derivations as an indirect criterion.
