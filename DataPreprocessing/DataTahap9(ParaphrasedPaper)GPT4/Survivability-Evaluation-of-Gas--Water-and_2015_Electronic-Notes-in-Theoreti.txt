The article discusses the increasing automation of city infrastructures such as power, water, and gas and emphasizes the need to assess their survivability due to society's critical dependence on these cyber-physical systems. It begins with an exploration of survivability concepts across different domains, like military technology and agriculture, acknowledging the varied definitions and aspects emphasized in the literature—ranging from fault detection to disaster recovery. While the paper does not introduce a new survivability definition, it presents a slightly generalized version focusing on post-disaster system behavior. A precise measure of survivability is hard to define, but different model-based approaches have been suggested for its quantitative determination.

The authors then discuss differences in modeling and evaluating the survivability of gas, water, and electricity infrastructures. Gas and electricity models tend to separate disaster handling mechanisms from system performance using stochastic processes and steady-state measures—akin to performability evaluation with Markov-reward models. However, water system modeling integrates these elements into a unified model.

To overcome scalability issues, the paper introduces a hybrid Petri nets approach, which separates deterministic and stochastic system evolutions by leveraging the quasi-deterministic behavior of infrastructures, considering that disaster occurrences are stochastic by nature. Stochastic Time Logic (STL) is then proposed to compute complex measures of interest over time, offering a means to express the concept of survivability.

Employing a case study, the paper details modeling a wastewater treatment facility in the Netherlands and its capacity to handle extreme weather or system failures. The work also discusses quantitative evaluation methods for transient behavior in gas distribution networks post-failure, including the use of non-Markovian transitions, signifying a more advanced modeling need compared to methods dealing solely with fluid volume and constants.

Moreover, research on improving power system reliability by integrating computer and communication technologies is reviewed, with survivability assessments previously conducted. Studies incorporating distributed generation as a backup in power systems and the impact on reliability metrics like SAIDI (System Average Interruption Duration Index) are also cited. Resilience as a recovery measure and state space factorization and aggregation in the event of failures are considered. The presented model also determines the effect of various input parameters on the energy not supplied during failures and can assist in optimizing investments for existing power grids.

In conclusion, while methods for evaluating survivability vary, these models serve as integral tools in guiding decision-making for smart grid investments, showcasing trade-offs between costs and reliability improvements.
