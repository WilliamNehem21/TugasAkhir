The Brane Calculus is a computational model designed to reflect the structure and behavior of biological membranes. To describe the properties of biological systems represented in this calculus, a specialized logic called Brane Logic was previously introduced. A crucial inquiry within this domain is the decidability of model checking for Brane Logic, which involves verifying if a system conforms to a specific logical formula automatically.

Previous research showed that model checking for Brane Logic is feasible when both the system lacks the ability to replicate and the formula is void of any guarantees. This paper progresses the discussion by demonstrating that when systems possess replication capabilities or when formulas include guarantee constructions and quantifiers, model checking becomes undecidable. Additionally, the paper establishes a correspondence between biological membranes and systems by proving that every system can be reconceptualized into a canonical form consisting of an empty compartment surrounded by an information-rich membrane.

Despite these findings, it's acknowledged that actions in Brane Calculus occur on membranes and not just within systems. Consequently, there are two spatial logics—one for membranes and another for systems—to accommodate this interaction.

The paper provides evidence that if processes can replicate without limit, whether on membranes or within systems, model checking using Brane Calculus and Brane Logic is undecidable. The logic fragment required for this conclusion is rather limited, excluding the need for quantifiers or adjoint connectives; it only necessitates propositional connectors, temporal and spatial modalities, and the compartment connector.

Furthermore, to facilitate the connection of two words in the model—akin to concatenating strings—an encoding process to attach actions on strings is included. This allows one string to be programmed to move into another, a function performed by the membrane mate operation.

The composition of the Brane Calculus is conceptually treated like a set constructor within the encoding. The elements of a domain (D) and the relational symbols in a structure (S) are straightforwardly encoded with action names D for elements of D and action names R_i for relational symbols R_i in S. The undecidability of model checking for a fragment of Brane Logic that includes quantifiers and adjoints, even when replication is absent, was confirmed. This conclusion was reached by translating the issue of determining the existence of finite models for first-order formulas into a problem of model checking.

Lastly, the results presented in the paper are also believed to be extendable to other variants of the Brane Calculus with similar expressive power, such as the projective branes, maintaining the argument that any system can essentially be formed from a canonical empty compartment enveloped by an informative membrane.
