Any space that is a weak limit satisfies Axiom (L2), though it may not always satisfy Axiom (L3). In any given topological space, denoted by Z, the convergence behavior obeys the rules set out for a limit space. When we refer to the weak limit space corresponding to this topological space, we use the notation LTop(Z). If a weak limit space can be represented as the result of this LTop operation on a topological space, then it is deemed a topological weak limit space.
