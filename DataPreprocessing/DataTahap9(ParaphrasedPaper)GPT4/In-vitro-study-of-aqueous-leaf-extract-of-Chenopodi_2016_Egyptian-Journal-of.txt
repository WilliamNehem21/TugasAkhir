In a modified version of the protocol described by Joshi et al. (2005b), an assay was conducted to assess the growth of brushite (calcium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate, CHPD) crystals using a single diffusion gel method and to investigate the inhibitory effects of citric acid at varying concentrations. 

For the experiment, glass test tubes of 2.5 cm diameter and 15 cm length were utilized. A sodium metasilicate solution with a specific gravity of 1.06 (5 mL) was adjusted to a suitable pH by adding 2.7 mL of orthophosphoric acid, followed by the careful addition of 10 mL of a 1 M calcium chloride solution to form the gel base. Within two days, crystal growth was observed upon the addition of the supernatant solutions, producing rapidly growing, elongated platelet-like and star-shaped crystals within the gel.

The growth progress of the crystals was monitored microscopically, with measurements taken at different intervals. A growth curve depicted that the crystals reached their maximum length by the fifth day after the addition of the supernatant solution. At this point, an aqueous citric acid solution and a customized compound (CAAE) were introduced in equivalent volumes to the initial calcium chloride solution to assess their impacts on crystal growth up to day eight. At pH 5.0, numerous star-shaped and platelet-like crystals were still present. Photographs were taken of the test tubes to document the crystal growth observed during the study.
