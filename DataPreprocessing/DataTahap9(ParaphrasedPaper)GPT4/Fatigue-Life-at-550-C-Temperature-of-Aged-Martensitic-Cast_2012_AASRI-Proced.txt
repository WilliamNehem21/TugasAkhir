The research paper discusses the continuous cyclic softening of a certain cast steel from the beginning to the end of a fatigue test. This softening is used to determine when the steel has reached its fatigue life limit. By monitoring changes in the hysteresis loop during compressive cycling, the researchers could identify when the material had fatigued. This behavior was confirmed to be consistent with that observed in high-chromium martensitic steels commonly used in power plants, although the latter steels exhibited periods where their hysteresis loop parameters would stabilize.

Among creep-resistant martensitic steels like P91 and P92, a similar pattern was seen in their brand-new, or "as-received," condition, though the crossover point to rapid fatigue (noted as "Nt") occurred around 1000 cycles. Notably, for aged GP91 cast steel, this crossover point moved to an earlier cycle count, indicating a degradation in the material's plastic properties compared to its original condition.
