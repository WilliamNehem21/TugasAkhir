Here's a paraphrased version of the abstract provided:

Imaging techniques can be enhanced with a region of interest (ROI) selection based on kidney function, ensuring the ROI marginally exceeds the kidney's boundaries by one pixel to capture complete information within the renal area. Our work suggests employing both spatial and temporal detection of key points for contour initialization, and introduces a multi-agent system to expedite this process.

Semi-automatic techniques: These methodologies facilitate the delineation of a renal ROI starting from a preset point. Y. Ariby and colleagues delineate various components within their software, including the "region_grow" algorithm for semi-automatic ROI delineation. Another strategy devised allows for the generation of renal ROI and renal function assessment in a limited cohort.

The HOG3D descriptor focuses on spatio-temporal characteristics, relying on histograms of 3D gradient orientations. Integral image representation is crucial for gradient computations, and one can utilize regular polyhedra for consistent quantification of spatio-temporal gradient orientations. We combine shape and movement descriptors in our research, applying HOG3D to videos by partitioning them into nx*ny*nt cells.

Our proposed method calculates the transit time, t(x, y), at each point (x, y), examining frontier transit time per point only once. It can be shown that t varies inversely with the front's velocity, denoted by the relationship |t|. f= 1(2). Since information propagates uni-directionally, the minimal t can reveal front propagation. Our idea involves guiding the leading edge within a buffered zone, which advances by freezing existing pixels while incorporating new ones into the zone.
