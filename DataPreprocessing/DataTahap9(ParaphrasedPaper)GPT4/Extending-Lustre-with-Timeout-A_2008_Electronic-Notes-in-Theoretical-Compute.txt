This research paper expands upon the Lustre programming language to better analyze Globally Asynchronous, Locally Synchronous (GALS) systems by adding new constructs for specifying timeout automata, which are models for asynchronous communication between synchronous processes. The new features are integrated into Lustre using an extensible language framework grounded in attribute grammars, ensuring that the language extensions are modular and can work in conjunction with other extensions seamlessly.

In the context of Lustre's application to GALS architectures, the paper highlights the need for simplifying the specification and analysis of these systems without directly generating code from it. Previously, users had to manually assemble a 'scheduler node' to handle the clocking of asynchronous processes, but the proposed language extensions enable the automatic derivation of such a scheduler based on process rates and clock drift specifications.

The research introduces a specific language construct called timeout condact, which prescribes the execution timing and allowable clock drift for a node that represents a periodic process within the GALS architecture. This construct uses default values before the first execution and the most recent value if the node fails to evaluate, functioning similarly to Lustre's condact expression.

To avoid high costs associated with developing specialized languages, the paper proposes an alternative approach using attribute grammars to create extensible frameworks for modifying Lustre and efficiently implementing domain-specific features like timeout automata. The paper discusses the implementation details, how the attribute grammar approach allows the language to extend, and how this approach enables useful static analysis capabilities that other extension methods (e.g., macro systems, object-oriented frameworks) may lack.

The paper also gives a real-world example of GALS systems' application in the context of an aircraft's flight guidance system, which consists of redundant units communicating over a bus where a scheduler manages the units' operation.

In conclusion, the paper outlines the significance of using extensible languages, particularly in how they apply to specifying, analyzing, and implementing extensions like state machines and modules within Lustre. The research emphasizes the attribute grammar-based approach's benefits over more traditional macro systems and object-oriented frameworks, particularly in its capacity to automatically combine multiple language extensions while maintaining robust static analysis features.
