This academic paper explores the concept of neural networks by drawing parallels with the state-and-effect triangles framework primarily used in quantum computing. The framework views computer programs as having a dual role: they transform states and predicates. In the context of neural networks, this duality is examined with the goal of understanding neural networks not in terms of their diverse specialized architectures, but rather as a universal combination of state and predicate transformers. The paper does not attempt to encompass numerous specialized neural networks into one framework but aims to describe neural networks, in general, using the multilayer perceptron (MLP) as a typical example for analysis.

The paper consists of different sections:

1. The first section introduces MLPS, their layers, and how they transform input data during the forward pass.
2. The subsequent section discusses the backwards transformation on loss functions, the crucial component of the learning process.
3. Backpropagation, the algorithm for optimizing neural networks, is then outlined using the state-and-effect perspective.
4. The paper further explores the compositional nature of backpropagation, conceptualizing it as a functorâ€”a mapping that preserves the structure between categories in mathematical terms.
5. Lastly, the paper compares its framework with existing literature and discusses the potential for expanding this categorical perspective to accommodate a broader range of neural network architectures in future work.

The work sheds light on neural networks by characterizing them as programs that transform the application of data (as states) and the adjustment of models based on errors (as predicates) using category theory. It emphasizes the structure-preserving nature of backpropagation and open possibilities for developing richer frameworks to capture various neural network architectures.
