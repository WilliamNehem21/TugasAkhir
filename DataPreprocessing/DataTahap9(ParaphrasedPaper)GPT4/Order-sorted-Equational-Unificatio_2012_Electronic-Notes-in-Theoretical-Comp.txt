This academic paper introduces an algorithm that adapts a generic unsorted E-unification procedure to perform order-sorted E-unification, assuming certain conditions that are typical in practical applications. The authors have integrated this method into the Maude system and have showcased its effectiveness when used with the Maude-NRL Protocol Analyzer, with significant performance gains achieved by reducing the number of unifiers needed. This is particularly useful for associative and commutative (AC and ACU) axioms.

The paper is structured to first provide essential background information on order-sorted algebra and unification, then details the algorithm for deriving order-sorted unifiers, followed by demonstration through examples involving AC and ACU unification in Maude. The paper also includes a proof of the algorithm's correctness. The authors discuss their test methodology using an alpha version of Maude and the tool CIME to handle unsorted unification problems. They explain how results from CIME are integrated back into Maude and validated against specific assumptions, emphasizing the reliability of this validation in their experiments. Finally, the paper concludes with a review of related work and suggestions for further research in this area.
