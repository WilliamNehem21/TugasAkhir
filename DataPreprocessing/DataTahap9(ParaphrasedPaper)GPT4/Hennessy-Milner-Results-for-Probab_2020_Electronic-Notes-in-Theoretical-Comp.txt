Probabilistic programming is a sophisticated approach that augments traditional imperative programming with the ability to create and manage systems that involve randomness, such as network and security protocols, machine learning models, and quantum computing algorithms. The diverse range of applications for probabilistic programming has recently generated substantial interest in the field. However, confirming the reliability and accuracy of these programs, as well as ensuring certain behaviors like their ability to consistently produce results (convergence) or eventually finish executing (termination), presents significant challenges. Consequently, developing formal methods that can analyze and verify such complex systems is crucial.

Point of interest 2.1 from the original paper that introduced the PPDL language mentions the use of arbitrary linear combinations of functions. However, for simplicity, our discussion will focus on positive linear combinations, with the understanding that allowing arbitrary combinations does not alter the outcomes we aim to prove.

It's important to note that in discrete settings and where state spaces can be described analytically, the concepts of state and event bisimulation typically align. Yet, these two concepts are distinct in broader contexts. From a categorical viewpoint, the concept of state bisimulation in the Labelled Markov Processes (LMPs) category, which is viewed through the lens of coalgebras with analytic state spaces, can be represented by spansâ€”analogous to a weak pullback in certain conditions. On the contrary, event bisimulations for LMPs can be depicted as cospans composed of surjections and do not require an analytic state space to be properly defined.

The paper progresses by introducing an advanced logic named PPDL+, which builds upon the foundational PPDL by incorporating the capability to process L0 formulas as functions, thereby expanding its expressive power and utility. The distinction between PPDL+ and its predecessor is highlighted by specifying the new aspects of its grammatical definition.

Lastly, the paper examines the criteria for state bisimilarity. This analysis is limited to LMPs and PPDL models that operate within analytic state spaces. The concept of state bisimulation for PPDL models is crafted as an extension to LMPs, factoring in the additional complexity of weight structures.
