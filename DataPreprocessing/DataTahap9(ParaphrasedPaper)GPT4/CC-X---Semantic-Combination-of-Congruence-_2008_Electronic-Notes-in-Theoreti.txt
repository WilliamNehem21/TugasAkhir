The paper discusses an algorithm, denoted as cc(x), which operates based on the theoretical existence of certain functions rather than their explicit implementation. The algorithm is designed to function without needing to explicitly utilize these functions, as it operates at a more abstract level where their conceptual presence is sufficient.

The paper also includes a table displaying evaluation metrics of the algorithm, with columns indicating the proportion of conditions validated by theorem provers (valid), the percentage of times a conclusive result wasn't determined before a preset time limit (timeout), cases left unresolved due to the algorithm's incompleteness (unknown), and the average time it took to arrive at a valid result (avg. time).

The cc(x) algorithm has been realized in the OCaml programming language as a functor—that is, a higher-order function that produces modules based on input modules—structured according to a theory module outlined in section 2.1 of the paper. This algorithm is integral to the operation of a theorem prover known as Ergo. It's made clear that, while the implementation precedes the formal theory, certain features have been added to cc(x) within Ergo that are yet to be rigorously defined and verifiably proven. These enhancements are proposed as subjects for future research.

One such addition involves a functor named combineX(x1, x2), which merges two theory modules, x1 and x2. This functor enables cc(x) to handle multiple solvable theories simultaneously. Although it's generally acknowledged that solvers for first-order logic theories are difficult to merge, the authors posit that solvers for typed theories can indeed be combined under specific constraints, although demonstrating this claim is beyond the scope of the current paper.
