OODIDA (On-board/Off-board Distributed Data Analysis) is a flexible system for handling distributed data analytics, specifically in the automotive sector. It emphasizes on processing data directly within vehicles to avoid the bottleneck of transferring large volumes of data to a central server for analysis. Data analysts use a Python library to create and confirm analytics tasks, which are divided into two parts: tasks executed by an on-board unit (OBU) in vehicles and tasks run on a central cloud server.

The OODIDA system previously required time-consuming updates, causing disruptions due to the need to stop and redeploy software when changes were made. To address this, a new feature for dynamic code updates has been implemented, allowing for custom code execution without the need to redeploy the system's components. This facilitates rapid prototyping and faster iteration in developing and refining data analysis methods.

The paper describes the system's update capability for running custom code, beginning with background information on OODIDA and how it can incorporate new computational methods. The focus is on processing vehicle data by the client (in vehicle) and in real-time, saving costs related to data transfer and storage and accelerating data insight generation.

Code verification involves syntax checks and function testing, ensuring compliance with expected formats and outputs. Custom code modules can be safely updated during ongoing data collection and are loaded on demand for execution.

The primary advantage of this code replacement approach is that it significantly reduces the time required to deploy and execute new computational methods. This contrasts with traditional update processes that necessitate full redeployment and reboots. The paper details the effectiveness of this feature using quantitative measures and practical examples, such as reduced data transfer sizes and bypassing organizational update delays.

The authors consider limitations, such as restrictions on using parts of the Python standard library and external libraries, and explore potential enhancements like extended safe return types and sandboxed client environments potentially utilizing lightweight containers.

In summary, the paper presents an advanced system tailored for the automotive context, offering efficient, real-time data analysis with the added benefit of flexible and rapid updates to analytics methods, significantly contributing to productivity and workflow efficiency.
