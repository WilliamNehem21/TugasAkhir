Advancements in integrated circuit (IC) fabrication technology have enabled manufacturing at the 7 nm scale, allowing for increased density of transistors on a chip and facilitating the creation of more complex system-on-a-chip (SoC) designs. SoCs are composed of numerous digital circuits that manage a plethora of internal and external signal communications. Routing these complex, intertwined signals within the limited space available has become a significant obstacle.

In response to this challenge, this study presents a novel routing algorithm, which builds upon the Lee algorithm, designed to expedite the verification process in SoCs. The primary benefits of this approach include the ability to rapidly evaluate the routing architecture, trace pathways from the source to the destination, and adjust the complexity to accurately simulate the architecture of SoCs. Experimental validations on five different levels of routing complexity have shown the effectiveness of this algorithm.

The ongoing evolution of semiconductor technology at the nanometer scale has led to transistors becoming smaller, making it possible to enhance the capacity, performance, and reliability of SoCs by integrating an increasing number of circuits. However, the intricate routing of signals across multiple modules within an SoC grows more challenging as circuit density increases.

The miniaturization of transistors expands digital circuit capacity but simultaneously reduces the space available for signal paths. Despite this, the chip area often remains the same or becomes smaller compared to older devices. The cutting-edge IC technology places more circuits into the same area, which limits the available paths for signal communication, thus exacerbating routing challenges.

In designing an SoC, after the placement of modules is finalized, routing must be performed to create connections from the source to the destination. The outcome of this process could either be a successful route, which is important for designers to consider in terms of signal delay and driver requirements, or a disconnection, indicating an area that requires design adjustments.

The study introduces a routing algorithm called CERA, which stands for Complexity Effect Routing Algorithm. CERA aims to address the routing challenges by finding paths through the SoC layout, reporting successes or highlighting disconnections, thus aiding designers in optimizing signal routing in increasingly complex SoC environments.
