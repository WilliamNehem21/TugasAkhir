An academic paper outlines the distinction between a data store and a data interchange in the context of application management. A data store forms the nucleus of an application, encapsulating its key concepts, retaining data, imposing constraints, and enabling functionalities. This data store must be rigorously maintained to safeguard data integrity and serve as the application's persistent memory.

In contrast, data interchange serves as the conduit for data transfer between applications, functioning as a temporary relay. It requires the source application to convert its data into the exchange format, while the recipient must interpret this format to update its internal data store. Data interchange operates independently, acting as an intermediary between applications.

To elucidate these concepts, the paper references the Process Data Exchange Institute (PDXI) initiative. In the early 1990s, a group of predominantly petrochemical companies under the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) established PDXI to create a standard for the exchange of data among chemical engineering design software.

Though there were initial reservations about a university-led team potentially lacking business acumen to complete the project, such concerns proved unfounded as the team collaborated effectively.

However, with hindsight, it became apparent there was a fundamental issue with the bulkiness of the 150-page models delivered, which were unwieldly for use as an interchange standard. The confusion stemmed from mistaking a comprehensive application model with the more refined requirements of an interchange model.

The interchanged models must be succinct, blending data with metadata, and though they might involve numerous records, they bear a smaller footprint in comparison to the extensive but more comprehensible data store models. This paper acknowledges that the failure to distinguish between these models during the project led to difficulties not recognized at the time.

Furthermore, part of the PDXI models dealt with physical properties (such as melting point and vapor pressure). The creation of a metamodel for this aspect was met with dissatisfaction from corporate sponsors, who sought something more concrete. In reflection, the paper suggests that these industrial sponsors lacked an understanding of what a practical data interchange model should be, aiming instead for something directly applicable to their business needs.
