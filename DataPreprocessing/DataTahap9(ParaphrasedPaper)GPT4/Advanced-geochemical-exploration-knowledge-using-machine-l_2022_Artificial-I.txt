Researchers in South Africa have implemented ongoing geochemical surveys, initially started in the early 2000s, with current expansions employing contemporary techniques to comprehensively analyze trace elements, especially those significant for energy-transitions and battery metals. The intent behind the data yielded from these surveys is threefold: the creation of digital maps, the evaluation of areas for potential mineral deposits, and the provision of insights for sustainable land-use planning. The choice of sampling media within any given area is informed by its prevalence and ease of procurement, with considerations of the strengths and methodological limitations of various sample types including rock, sediments, and water.

The article discusses how lake sediment data from the Geo-mapping for Energy and Minerals (GEM) program in Canada has been consistently utilized to study surface geology due to its extensive spatial distribution. This historical lake sediment data analysis, originally conducted between 1978 and 1986 for different regions in Canada, has been updated in 2016 and 2021 through re-evaluation campaigns, showcasing the program's commitment to keeping data current.

Despite the fact that the GEM program has yet to incorporate predictive prioritization in its strategy, the article suggests that such an approach—particularly one that leverages prior geological understanding—could streamline the identification of regions with economically valuable minerals. Current exploratory geochemical programs seem to lack predictive data generation methods.

The paper further explores the potential of machine learning as a tool for emulating the relationships between elements within geochemical datasets, allowing for the prediction of elemental concentrations in areas yet to be sampled. Legacy data that do not include a broad spectrum of elements, like those from the Athabasca uranium deposits, could particularly benefit from such predictive models. These models could ultimately facilitate more strategic planning for future sampling and analysis campaigns.

It is posited that predictive data generation could be integral to the advancement of exploration programs by providing estimates of data prior to actual collection. The study demonstrates that by harnessing both existing (legacy) and newer geochemical data, and considering the stringent standardization within survey programs, it is feasible to produce probable data that is useful both for its immediate value and for guiding subsequent exploration efforts.

The approach outlined in the paper can help bridge the gap between the slow pace of data acquisition in exploration geochemistry and the rapid, data-intensive demands of modern data-driven methodologies. It can provide prospectivity mappers and other data users with valuable information in a timely manner, leading to the identification of subtle geochemical anomalies and possibly expediting resource discoveries, especially for critical raw materials. While predictions may not reach the accuracy of actual measurements, their precision is expected to improve as more contemporary data become available. Indeed, possessing advanced knowledge now can be more beneficial than obtaining precise information later, emphasizing the increasing value of data in digitally-driven societies.
