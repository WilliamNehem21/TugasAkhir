This study advances a wider initiative aimed at establishing a comprehensive theoretical framework for reflection in various logics and declarative languages, building upon earlier findings. The findings discussed in this document highlight the question of the interconnections between the universal theories of connected logics. The anticipation is that the metalogical principles laid out in the general theory of logics, which underpin the axiomatic methodology employed in analyzing reflection, will supply the necessary concepts to tackle this question in a way that is both precise and not bound to any particular formalism.
