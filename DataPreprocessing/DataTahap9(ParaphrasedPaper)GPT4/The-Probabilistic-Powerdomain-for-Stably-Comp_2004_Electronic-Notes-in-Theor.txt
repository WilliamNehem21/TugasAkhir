This academic paper explores the probabilistic powerdomain of stably compact spaces, a concept stemming from compact ordered spaces, utilizing tools from measure theory and functional analysis. The study provides a unified approach for establishing both existing and novel findings, which are encapsulated in Theorem 5.4.

Denotational semantics employs the probabilistic powerdomain, as introduced by Jones and Plotkin, to model random phenomena in computing by simulating probabilities and probability measures. With growing interest in this area, there's a recognition that access to foundational information on probabilistic powerdomains is often challenging due to its dissemination primarily through academic theses.

For denotational semantics, there's a need to rework classical concepts such as measure, probability, and integration to fit within the framework of domains—a structure characterized by properties such as continuity, directed completeness, and a partial order. The Scott topology, inherently tied to every domain, replaces the standard Hausdorff topology and leads to valuations acting as a type of continuous measurement over Scott-open sets. Valuations compress into a domain of their own, known as the extended probabilistic powerdomain.

To be more inclusive of those unfamiliar with domain theory, this paper is framed within the context of compact ordered spaces. Classical functional analysis is then harnessed to demonstrate the intimate link between valuations on the stably compact space (X, G) and the characteristics of the probabilistic powerdomain of such spaces, in relation to regular Borel measures and the compact convex set of probability measures on (X, O) with respect to the weak*-topology. Notably, these findings also pertain to domains possessing Lawson compactness.

While some of the results presented here aren't novel—crediting previous research by M. Alvarez Manilla, who delved into the parallels between valuations and classical measure theory—the paper’s contribution lies in its clear, straightforward presentation and the usage of standard functional analysis to justify the results. Additionally, the authors express gratitude to A. Jung for his constructive feedback and critiques.
