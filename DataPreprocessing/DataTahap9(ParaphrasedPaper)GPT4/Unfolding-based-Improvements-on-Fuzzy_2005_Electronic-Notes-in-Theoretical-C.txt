This academic paper presents a study of extending unfolding techniques, which are semantics-preserving transformations used to expand program subexpressions, to a fuzzy logic context. Traditional logic programming languages struggle to handle uncertainty and approximation; fuzzy logic, with its concept of fuzzy sets and expanded truth value ranges between 0 and 1, offers a mathematical framework for addressing these challenges.

The authors present an enhancement to the F-Prolog dialect, where each program clause can be interpreted through various logics, enabling the programming language to cope with fuzzy concepts. To achieve this, the paper adapts fuzzy variants of classical unfolding operations used in pure logic programs and establishes their strong correctness by ensuring that transformed programs compute the same fuzzy results as the original ones.

Furthermore, the paper defines a computation rule specific to the fuzzy setting and proves its independence, mirroring the classical case in pure logic programming. The main contribution of the research is the verification that these transformation rules not only preserve semantics but also improve the efficiency of resulting programs by shortening the length of successful fuzzy SLD-derivations.

In their investigation, the authors evaluate different fuzzy logics such as min-max, Lukasiewicz logic, and parametric interpretations of fuzzy connectives. They argue for an approach where clauses in a program can be interpreted using different logics, providing great flexibility for fuzzy logic programming languages.

Finally, the paper outlines its structure: it begins with a summary of an extended fuzzy Prolog dialect, describes its operational semantics, adapts the concept of a computation rule to the fuzzy context, defines transformation rules based on this fuzzy computation, and concludes with the main theoretical and practical properties of these rules. The study aims to enrich logic programming languages with the ability to effectively manage fuzzy logic, thereby broadening the range of applications for logic programming in domains that require handling uncertainty and imprecise information.
