This paper examines the extent to which additional hybrid features can be incorporated into Interval Neighbourhood Logic (PNL) and its metric counterpart (MPNL) without compromising the solvability of their respective satisfiability issues. Specifically, the authors explore a natural hybrid extension of MPNL by introducing binders for integer variables that denote the lengths of intervals, which allows for the length of a current interval to be stored and referenced later. Their significant finding reveals that even a restricted version of this extension results in undecidability, which is unexpected considering MPNL's decidability, highlighting that MPNL could represent the most extensive decidable hybrid extension of PNL.

Interval temporal logics typically emphasize the sequencing of time intervals rather than individual moments in time and are employed in various areas including computer science, artificial intelligence, and temporal databases. The practicality of interval-based temporal logics is particularly evident in hardware specification, real-time system verification, and other fields such as action theory, natural language processing, and constraint satisfaction.

Through further analysis, the paper presents the conclusion that augmenting PNL and MPNL with interval length variables and binders inevitably leads to undecidability, even in simplified forms. This conclusion stands in stark contrast to MPNL's decidability and suggests MPNL operates at the boundary of what a decidable hybrid extension of PNL might encompass. Additionally, the paper contrasts the prevalent undecidability found in hybrid interval logics that genuinely rely on interval semantics with the stronger decidability persistence of hybrid extensions of point-based interval logics.

The paper also outlines an encoding approach, involving a unique sequence of finite intervals (referred to as a U-chain) that effectively arranges a tiling within the logical framework. This involves the use of specialized chain intervals (ID-chains), each representing a row in the tiling structure and specific propositional letters that encode the start and endpoints of these ID-chains.

Finally, the paper concludes that natural extensions of PNL and MPNL with variables and binders related to interval lengths predominantly result in undecidability, even in tightly constrained scenarios. This indicates that to preserve decidability, substantial limitations must be applied to the use of length binders. The proposed restrictions essentially reduce the expressiveness of the resulting languages to that of their non-hybrid counterparts, leaving open the question of whether meaningful expressiveness can be achieved with the addition of hybrid elements to interval logic while maintaining decidability.
