The academic paper suggests that the belief that simpler modal logics (L0) are less complex than their non-simplified counterparts (L) does not always hold true. Specifically, both the minimal modal logic K and its closed fragment K0 have been shown to be PSPACE-complete, as has the modal logic K4, which is used for transitive frames.

Furthermore, the paper notes a common assumption in the field that the full interpretability logic (IL) falls within PSPACE in terms of computational complexity. However, the authors point out that, surprisingly, no formal proof of this complexity status has been established for IL. This realization has opened up new research avenues, as there seems to be a lack of complexity analysis within interpretability logics. The brief communication is presented as a potential starting point for future research into the complexity of various interpretability logicsâ€”an area that has remained unexplored despite the field's overall development.
