In the paper, the authors discuss a technical topic based on a complex vocabulary which may not be immediately accessible, but it is noted that with tools like existential quantification and disjunction, it's possible to define certain predicates, such as "z(n1, n2)," which represent a specific condition regarding the configuration of a process term.

They consider processes, denoted "pm," that emulate Turing machines, "m," and explore conditions under which a Turing machine halts and how another entity, "e," functions as a storage unit until the halt occurs. The processes they study are deterministic, allowing for a single possible execution path, for a combined system "pm|e."

The paper concludes with the identification of three areas for future research. Firstly, the practical implications of the proposed closed system modeling approach are not yet investigated, including the potential for new methods in specification and verification. Secondly, the model checking algorithm introduced in the paper is complex and currently impractical, necessitating improvements for real-world application, possibly informed by existing model checking approaches in epistemic logics. Lastly, the authors express interest in extending their findings to encompass strategic abilities, referencing the established frameworks of alternating-time temporal logic (AFL).
