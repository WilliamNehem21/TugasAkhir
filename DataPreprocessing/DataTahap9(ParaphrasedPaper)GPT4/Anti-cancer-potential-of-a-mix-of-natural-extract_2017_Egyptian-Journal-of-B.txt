This study addresses the pressing issue of cancer morbidity and mortality by seeking to develop non-toxic, sustainable, and affordable anticancer therapies derived from alternative medicine. The research investigates the anticancer potential and antioxidant properties of an aqueous mixture of natural extracts (NE mix) made from turmeric, ginger, and garlic, and its impact on human breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, ZR-75, and MDA-MB 231). The study performed a qualitative analysis of bioactive constituents from the three spices using liquid chromatography-ESI-mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS).

To the researchers’ knowledge, this is the first time the NE mix has been tested in combination with the breast cancer drug tamoxifen for anticancer properties. The findings revealed that the NE mix promoted apoptosis—a type of programmed cell death—in all tested breast cancer cell lines, with more pronounced effects in the MCF-7 and ZR-75 lines compared to the MDA-MB 231 line. When combined with tamoxifen, the NE mix further enhanced the level of apoptosis, suggesting a potential for making estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer cells more responsive to tamoxifen treatment.

Additional experimental support, such as MTT assays and cell cycle analysis, coupled with RT-PCR results, indicated that the NE mix, either alone or in combination with tamoxifen, altered the expression of apoptotic markers (p53 and caspase 9), leading to increased apoptosis in the cancer cell lines.

The study also discusses the cultural and dietary significance of turmeric, ginger, and garlic in India and their use in Ayurvedic medicine, highlighting the bioactive components these spices possess, such as curcumin from turmeric, allicin from garlic, and 6-gingerol from ginger. These natural extract ingredients are known for their medicinal properties and have been traditionally used to potentially induce apoptosis in cancer cells.

Moreover, the study touches on the role of the tumor suppressor protein p53 in preventing tumor development via apoptosis and notes that while p53 mutations are prevalent in breast neoplasia, they occur less frequently in other solid tumors. It also outlines the reagents and materials used in the experiments, including acetonitrile, formic acid, methanol, and deionized water, along with the techniques employed to assess hydroxyl radical scavenging activity and the methodology for inducing and measuring apoptosis in vitro.

Finally, the paper explores the possibility that natural extracts may sensitize cancer cells to hormone therapy drugs like tamoxifen, which is supported by existing literature on phyto and dietary products' additive or synergistic effects in cancer prevention and treatment. The findings demonstrate the potential for natural extracts to complement conventional therapy, emphasizing the need for further research to understand the precise mechanisms involved. The results suggest that these extracts could have a role in developing new treatment strategies targeting breast cancers.
