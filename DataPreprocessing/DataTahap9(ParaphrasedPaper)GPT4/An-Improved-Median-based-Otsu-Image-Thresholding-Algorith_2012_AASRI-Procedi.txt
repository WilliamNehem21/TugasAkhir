In the realms of pattern recognition, machine learning, image processing, and computer vision, segmenting gray level images is a crucial yet challenging preliminary step. The Otsu thresholding method is a prominent technique for image segmentation, celebrated for its efficacy and automatic nature. It excels at dividing gray level images with bimodal histograms but underperforms with unimodal or skewed distributions, often struggling with long-tailed distributions in the presence of noise.

To address this limitation, a novel approach was developed that builds upon the Otsu method, introducing a median-based strategy for improved performance. This enhanced Otsu algorithm substitutes the use of means for medians when calculating the threshold, which improves accuracy and yields more satisfying results, particularly for images with skewed distributions or noise.

The research leading to these findings received support from various educational projects, including those sponsored by the Ministry of Education and Jilin University. Extensive tests have demonstrated the superiority of the median-based Otsu method over the original algorithm, making it a valuable contribution to the field of image analysis and preprocessing.
