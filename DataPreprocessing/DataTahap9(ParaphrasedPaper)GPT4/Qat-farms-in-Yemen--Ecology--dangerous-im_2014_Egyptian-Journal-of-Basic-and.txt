This academic paper examines the plant Catha edulis, commonly known as qat, whose leaves contain stimulant alkaloids and are traditionally chewed in some regions. The World Health Organization has classified qat as a substance capable of causing moderate to severe psychological dependence. As early as 1956, qat was recommended for classification as a narcotic to the United Nations Commission, leading to discussions about its prohibition.

The authors conducted field studies across 12 different sites at varying altitudes in the mountains of Sana'a and Taiz, Yemen, between 1992 and 1994 to understand the anatomy of qat leaves, and the chemical properties of the soil where it grows. The soil samples, taken from different depths, were air-dried and analyzed physically and chemically. Groundwater samples were collected from wells of varying depths. Leaf samples of Catha edulis were collected and analyzed for proline levels using Bates' method. The total soluble nitrogen was determined by the micro-Kjeldahl method, and leaf sections were prepared and observed using light microscopy.

There were multivariate analyses conducted, including Two-way Indicator Species Analysis (TWINSPAN) for classifying cultivation sites, and Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) to investigate the relationship between vegetation and environmental factors. Data across studies were subjected to statistical tests to assess differences among sites and to explore correlations between environmental and anatomical variables and the plant's adaptive features.

In Yemen, there are about 40 different types of qat with various effects on consumers, ranging from mood alteration to digestive and sexual effects. Historical chemical studies of qat identified several alkaloids and compounds with effects ranging from stimulant-like properties to cytotoxic activities against cancer cell lines.

The environmental study highlighted that different species seem to adapt to specific environmental conditions such as soil salinity. The cultural and economic impact of qat chewing was also addressed, indicating that it has led to the decline of coffee agriculture, with qat largely consumed locally and considered less harmful by many in the region, despite its classification as a drug.

The paper provides insight into the complexity of qat cultivation in Yemen, the chemical composition and effects of the plant, as well as the socio-economic and cultural significance of qat in local communities.
