The original text explains how the authors extended the Maude system, which inherently lacks real-time features, by integrating it with a Java class that manages time-related functions using socket communication. Java objects in the class are tasked with timing operations that wait for specific durations (measured in milliseconds) before sending "tick" messages back to Maude, which then updates time-related attributes and prompts subsequent wait messages.

The authors outline their approach to analyzing a previously introduced distributed system using Maude's analysis tools, including Real-Time Maude. They chose to represent system states explicitly, with detailed structure and temporal behaviors, including process boundaries and connections. They implemented a `Link` class to detail network links between processes, capturing link delays, message queues, and message transfer counts, with pairs of messages and remaining times representing delayed message transmissions.

Additionally, the Java class facilitates linking Maude to real-world time, illustrating the general approach's applicability for integrating Java's capabilities into Maude. However, they recognize performance drawbacks due to the necessity of translating messages into strings for transmission and back into message formats upon receipt, suggesting that a built-in Maude `send` operator that directly handles general terms would enhance system efficiency. 

**Paraphrased Version:**

To accommodate real-time functions within Maude, which doesn't naturally support them, a Java class capable of managing time through socket connections was created. This class handles timing operations by responding to `wait(n)` commands, with `n` indicating a milliseconds countdown. After the countdown, the class responds with a "tick" message that Maude utilizes to update time attributes and initiates a new timing operation.

This paper presents a method for evaluating the previously described distributed network within Maude's analysis environment, aiming to preserve detailed temporal behavior and communication between processes. A specialized `Link` class was devised to encapsulate network connections, tracking delays, message queues, and counts for simulating errors. Messaging delays were modeled with pairs indicating the message and its transmission countdown.

The study also explored novel applications for the Java class in connection with Maude, highlighting how it enables Maude to track the passage of time, showing the class's versatility for integrating Java features into Maude.

The paper concludes by noting performance issues arising from the requisite string translation of messages for network transmission, suggesting that a native `send` functionality for general terms in Maude could potentially offset these inefficiencies.
