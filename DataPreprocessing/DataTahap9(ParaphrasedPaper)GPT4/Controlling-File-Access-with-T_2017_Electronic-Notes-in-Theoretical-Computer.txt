This research paper addresses the issue of accidental misuse of shared files by legitimate users. It introduces a new type system, rooted in static analysis principles, aiming to prevent such misuse by enforcing file policy compliance through type checking of user commands within a file system.

The system specifically targets a policy whereby file owners (creators) can limit the number of times a file can be read by restricting its copy operations. As such, a file's readability is directly linked to its copy allowances; a file cannot be copied means it can only be read once. The proposed type system extends beyond this specific policy to potentially include other properties and access controls.

The paper is structured as follows:

1. Section 2 outlines the security types and file policies.
2. Section 3 introduces the syntax and semantics pertinent to file manipulation, along with an algorithm for detecting syntactical errors and defining security errors.
3. Section 4 elaborates on the type system and its properties.
4. Section 5 provides a type checking algorithm, along with proofs of its soundness and completeness.
5. Section 6 reviews related work.
6. Section 7 concludes the paper.

The approach relies on three security types to regulate file copying operations: 'UC' (Unrestricted Copy), 'LCN' (Linear Copy, N times), and 'NC' (No Copy). UC files can be freely copied, LCN files can only be copied a defined number of times, with their copies becoming NC, and NC files cannot be copied at all.

The paper demonstrates that commands within their language framework are monotonically increasing concerning file typesâ€”they cannot downgrade in security level. It discusses the soundness (i.e., the algorithm's reliability) and completeness (i.e., the algorithm's ability to identify all proper commands) of their approach.

Additionally, the paper notes that conventional security levels focus only on controlling information flow between levels and do not restrict specific operations within a level. The type system presented in the paper aims to control both information flow and the actual operations on data.

The authors conclude by noting the simplicity of the language and the type system used to illustrate the concept, acknowledging future work to expand the language and incorporate features like conditionals, loops, recursion, and variables. They also mention an extension of their work to include additional policies and types regarding read and write operations and how users are authorized to interact with files.

This framework not only manages the access and flow of copy, read, and write operations but also which users can perform these operations by integrating labels indicating ownership and authorization information. Lastly, it explores the possibility for file owners to change file policies and the necessary commands and type system extensions to support such functionality.
