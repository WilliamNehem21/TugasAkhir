The study's objective was to develop algorithms capable of segmenting cotton bolls under varying natural lighting conditions using a universal threshold value to minimize inaccuracies during different times of day—morning, afternoon, and evening. The team introduced four new cotton segmentation methods to aid in the optical recognition of cotton bolls by robotic cotton harvesters. They tested four color spaces, but ultimately selected RGB and YCbCr for segmentation under natural light. By selecting optimal threshold values and applying morphological operations, such as opening and closing, the team aimed to reduce noise and fill gaps in the segmented binary images. The efficacy of the algorithms was assessed by evaluating the hit rate, false positives, false negatives, processing time, sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy.

Cotton bolls are typically identified based on their color characteristics, and color spaces such as RGB, HSV, L*a*b, and YCbCr are commonly used for feature segmentation in color images. Choosing the right color space is paramount for successful object detection in such images. This study specifically utilized RGB and YCbCr color spaces to develop algorithms for in-field detection of cotton. The four image processing algorithms were designed to create binary images where the cotton bolls were represented as white (pixel value of 1) and the background, including stems and leaves, as black (pixel value of 0).

Selecting the right threshold values was a critical part of ensuring accurate segmentation and cotton boll detection. The study used color thresholding as the segmentation technique. Ground truth images—those segmented by a more reliable, often manual method—were used for comparison and evaluation of the proposed algorithms, as demonstrated in previous research by Hu et al. (2015), Tsai and Tseng (2012), and Bachche and Oka (2013).

The performance of the segmentation algorithms was measured with two approaches: one involved counting true detected cotton (correctly identified cotton bolls), false detected cotton (incorrectly identified elements as cotton), and missed cotton (unidentified cotton bolls). The accuracy metrics employed these counts to calculate various performance indicators, such as True Positives (TP), True Negatives (TN), False Positives (FP), and False Negatives (FN), to better assess the accuracy of cotton boll detection.
