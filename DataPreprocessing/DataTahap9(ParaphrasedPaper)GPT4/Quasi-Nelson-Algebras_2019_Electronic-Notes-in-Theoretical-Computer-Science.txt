In our study, we must underline the necessity of our indirect approach to proving certain concepts, such as proposition 2.7, for which a direct proof is currently out of reach. Our method, which presents quasi-Nelson residuated lattices through twist-structures, is not only a necessary approach but also provides a clear path to constructing specific instances of these algebras. We also want to emphasize to the reader, especially those with a keen interest in logic, that although our research focuses on algebras, we interpret these algebras as the algebraic equivalent of logical systems. Our investigation into algebraizable logics justifies this perspective because it allows us to translate findings between the domains of algebra and logic with relative ease.
