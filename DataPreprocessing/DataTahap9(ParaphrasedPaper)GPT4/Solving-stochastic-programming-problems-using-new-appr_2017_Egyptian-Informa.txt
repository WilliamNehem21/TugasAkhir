This scholarly article discusses a search method called Differential Evolution (DE), which is one of the newest Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) used for real-parameter optimization problems. DE diverges from other EAs by leveraging distance and direction to steer its search. The study focuses on two stochastic programming (SP) models: Linear Stochastic Fractional Programming Problems (LSFPP) and Multiobjective Stochastic Linear Programming Problems (MOSLP). These problems incorporate randomness in their data, assuming inputs follow a probability distribution.

The concept of Stochastic Sum-of-Probabilistic Fractional Programming (SSFP) is introduced for optimizing the sum of multiple ratios of random functions. The paper presents a general model for SSFP problems, using a series of probability constraints.

The research conducts 50 runs for each experimental setup and records the best solution as the global optimum. The results of different DE versions (DESP) are then compared with other algorithms such as LDE, basic DE, basic PSO, and results from previous studies. The paper suggests that future research could explore the self-adaptive mechanisms for controlling the crossover rate in DESP.

Further proposed areas of investigation include applying DESP to different types of problems, such as constrained and mixed-integer programming, as well as multi-objective optimization in both constrained and unconstrained contexts. Additionally, the study encourages integrating a triangular mutation strategy with other evolutionary and foraging algorithms to potentially improve performance across various real-world applications.
