The absence of bioinformatics resources for rapid evaluation of protein structural and topological characteristics led to the development of a comprehensive and easy-to-use R package called fiscore. This package provides a workflow for Gaussian mixture modeling, making advanced machine learning techniques accessible to researchers without specialized expertise. Probabilistic machine learning methods incorporated in fiscore are valuable for interpreting complex biological behaviors, particularly in identifying structural attributes related to protein functionality. The package is based on the mathematical representation of protein physicochemical properties, which is useful in drug discovery, target validation, and database construction. It offers interactive options for users to examine different features and aims to involve structural bioinformaticians in creating more powerful, open-source R tools that assist researchers outside of this specialized area. fiscore (version 0.1.3) is freely available on CRAN and GitHub.

The fiscore package also includes a function that uses the Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobicity scale to identify hydrophobic regions in proteins, which can be predictive of their exposure on the protein surface or within a membrane environment. Hydrophobic scores are adjusted and normalized to allow comparison across different proteins. This analysis can guide protein engineering and drug discovery efforts by enabling decisions about protein domains or regions regarding solvent exposure and environment preferences.

Users who desire to explore clustering alternatives beyond those given by the automated BIC output can do so with an advanced option in fiscore. This allows refined control over which model to test and the number of clusters to consider. The package also provides 3D visualizations and density plots for residue-specific dihedral angle distributions, aiding in the assessment of protein quality and feature separation based on structural components.

Through pattern extraction and machine learning, fiscore helps identify proteins with common functional features, simplifying structural data mining and classification without the necessity for in-depth structural analysis. This approach is extendable to other protein studies, including potential ligand interactions.

The fiscore package streamlines complex analytical processes, enabling researchers with limited knowledge in structural bioinformatics or machine learning to still utilize the tools for protein engineering, evaluation, and data management based on specific targets. Particularly beneficial in pharmaceutical research and drug discovery, these interactive analysis and visualization tools support the assessment of intricate targets and protein interactions, leading to enhanced target classification and therapeutic development. In essence, fiscore fills a critical need for specialized analytical tools and techniques in research and development, fostering the improvement of target assessment and therapeutics.
