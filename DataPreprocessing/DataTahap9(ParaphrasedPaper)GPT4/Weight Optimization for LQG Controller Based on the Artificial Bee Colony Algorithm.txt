In a study comparing control methods for large antenna servo systems, it was determined that the Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) controller outperforms the Proportional Integral (PI) controller with respect to stability, response speed, and reduction of wind disturbances. However, no definitive approach has been established for setting the LQG controller's weight matrices, which are crucial for its performance. The paper introduces a solution to this issue using an optimization technique based on the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm, which enhances the transient response performance of a closed-loop system. The ABC algorithm, featuring a blend of global and local search processes in each iteration, significantly increases search effectiveness. In simulations involving a large antenna servo system and LQG controller, the ABC algorithm proved to be effective, yielding improved control compared to trial and error methods.

The Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm, originating from research by Karaboga et al. in 2007, models the food foraging behavior of bees. Despite being relatively new, the ABC algorithm has attracted research interest due to its simplicity and fewer parameters to adjust, making it easy to put into practice. It performs better in discovering global optima and avoiding local ones compared to Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), thanks to its iterative global and local search. It has been applied successfully in various optimization tasks, including unconstrained numerical optimization, constrained numerical optimization, and neural network training, with consistently satisfactory results.

This paper advances the use of the ABC algorithm for tuning the weight matrices of the LQG controller. By defining a reference model with the desired close-loop performance, the algorithm optimizes the weight matrices so the servo system closely matches the reference model's characteristics. This automation circumvents the tedious and often imprecise manual trial and error process, thus enhancing the design efficiency of LQG controllers. Simulation results for a large antenna servo system confirm the method's validity and the ABC algorithm's capacity to significantly improve system speed, stability, and overshoot performance when optimized weight matrices are applied.
