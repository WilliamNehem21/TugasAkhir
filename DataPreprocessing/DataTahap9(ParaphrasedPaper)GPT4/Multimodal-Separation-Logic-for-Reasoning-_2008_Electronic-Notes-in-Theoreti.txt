In the upcoming section, the paper outlines the type of programming language semantics being studied. It goes on to give examples of different programming languages, using the unique requirements of each language to illustrate specific aspects of their semantic model. The authors intend to maintain an informal style of writing and prioritize the discussion on practical uses.

The framework chosen for analysis is deterministic small-step operational semantics, which are relatively straightforward to build for both simple languages such as assembly and more complex languages. These semantics align more closely with the behavior of low-level languages compared to other sorts of semantics, like axiomatic semantics. The small-step approach is particularly relevant for languages with shared-memory concurrency, as big-step semantics would complicate the analysis of possible execution orderings. Determinism simplifies the logic required to reason about program execution, allowing proof by induction on the number of steps, with nondeterminism managed through the use of oracles, as demonstrated in one of the sections.

The paper then moves on to discuss the traditional Kripke model's final component, the accessibility relation, which frames the semantics of modal operators in logic. It points out that traditional presentations of Kripke semantics may be too narrow, often focusing on a single modality, so the authors advocate for a more versatile approach with multiple modalities.

The authors note a modification in their definition of a specific semantic construct, which incorporates an operator that ensures the definition is contractive, thereby allowing the use of certain lemmas in their proofs.

The paper defines several semantic constructs related to resource mapping, a key concept in Concurrent Separation Logic (CSL). These constructs set up the foundation for proving safety or partial-correctness of programs, ensuring they do not reach a stuck state. The resource invariants, which are part of the CSL, are modeled as predicates on possible program states (worlds).

Additionally, the paper defines conditions for "joinability," which is a term related to how resources can be combined in the semantics. Resource maps must align in a particular way, with shareable resources at each location being compatible. The concept is applied to different types of resources, like values and locks, to establish whether they can be joined.

The paper also reviews the simplicity of languages studied by early computer scientists, highlighting that the limited set of operations did not match the more complex languages used by programmers in practice.

Moreover, it references work on encoding a modal linear logic within the Coq proof assistant, although this logic lacks some features such as quantification and assumes specific modal properties.

Finally, the authors reflect on the impact of their semantic techniques through a real-world example: a soundness proof for the operational semantics of concurrent Cminor. With around 50,000 lines of Coq code, they argue that the application of modal techniques has made the proof more feasible, reduce its complexity, and hope that continuing this approach will further enhance the proof's elegance and manageability.
