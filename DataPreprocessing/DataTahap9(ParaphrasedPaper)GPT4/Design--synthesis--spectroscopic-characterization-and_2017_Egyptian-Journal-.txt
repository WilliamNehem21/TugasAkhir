The study aimed to create and evaluate the antipsychotic potential of new derivatives combining phenothiazine and various chemical groups like azodyes, Schiff bases, and chalcones. These compounds were synthesized and structurally validated using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR), mass spectrometry, and elemental analysis.

The antipsychotic properties were tested in an animal model, where the compounds were administered to groups of six animals, and their ability to induce catalepsy was compared to that of haloperidol, a known antipsychotic drug. During the test, an animal's front paws were placed on a raised bar, and the duration they maintained this abnormal position was measured.

Among the synthesized chemicals, one in particular, named GC8, demonstrated a high capacity to induce catalepsy, comparable to haloperidol. This compound also significantly affected dopamine levels in the animals, suggesting it operates in a similar manner to haloperidol.

The chemical synthesis involved initial reactions to form specific intermediates, followed by reactions with various reagents to produce the azodye, Schiff base, and chalcone derivatives. The spectral data obtained from FT-IR and 1H NMR confirmed the presence of key functional groups in the synthesized compounds.
