The academic paper discusses the complexities of resource scheduling in cloud environments, which are used for distributing and aggregating resources across various locations to tackle large-scale problems. To address this, the paper examines renowned scheduling methods from the computational economy framework, Nimrod-G, that balance resource supply and demand.

This study introduces a novel scheduling algorithm that focuses on optimizing both deadline and cost, an evolution of previous methods that only considered one of these factors. The algorithm aims to maintain optimized performance levels.

To evaluate the algorithm, the researchers set up a simulated experiment using the GridSim toolkit on a Linux operating system. They configured the simulation with 100 jobs requiring 90 seconds each and processed them over 10 queues. Access costs for CPU time were set to incrementally increase from 10 to 28 G$. The optimal deadline was determined to be such that each queue handled 10 jobs. For simulation purposes, three deadline scenarios were tested: 990 seconds (optimal deadline +10%), 1980 seconds (twice the initial value), and 2970 seconds (three times the initial value). Additionally, they experimented with budget variations between 5,000 G$ and 22,000 G$ in increments of 1,000 G$.

The findings showed that compared to strategies exclusively focused on cost or time, the proposed deadline and cost optimization algorithm (DCOA) strikes a balance between the two aspects. If the time aspect is set to zero in the algorithm, it defaults to a cost-optimization strategy. Notably, DCOA includes more Quality of Service (QoS) factors than the previous two strategy types.

Looking ahead, the researchers plan to enhance their resource allocation model by integrating resource reservations and various economic models, assessing the efficiency of different models. They also aim to explore other aspects such as credit assessment, and strategies for job preemption and migration, with a goal of maintaining the integrity of market transactions.
