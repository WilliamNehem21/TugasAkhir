In this paper, we present a comprehensive answer to a specific question by identifying that there are exactly five relevant classes. These classes are each associated with either a subgroup of the alternating group on four elements (A4) or a subgroup of the symmetric group on three elements (S3). We express our astonishment at this finding given the common assumption that classical and quantum channels differ fundamentally; one might anticipate that their shared structure would be quite minimal.

Furthermore, for all indices i, the expression (ei, b) equals zero, which implies that b must be zero. Consequently, any affine homeomorphism transforming the unit ball onto itself must map the center to the center. This restriction requires such qubit channels to be unital. Using elementary arguments, it is shown that the matrix M in this context must necessarily be an orthogonal matrix with a determinant of +1, meaning it is an element of the special orthogonal group SO(3).
