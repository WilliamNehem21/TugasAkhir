This study focuses on addressing the issue of malicious packet-dropping attacks within networks, where compromised nodes deliberately fail to forward packets, substantially reducing network throughput. The research presents a host-based misuse detection system based on game theory to identify and protect against such malicious actors in the network.

The paper details the specific vulnerabilities posed by attacks like packet dropping on the Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol, and introduces a detection solution that leverages neighbor monitoring and game theory. It outlines how game-theoretical analysis can be used to develop optimal strategies for anomaly-based intrusion detection systems.

The structure of the paper is as follows: Section 2 reviews related work on the application of game theory to Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET) security. Section 3 describes the proposed game theory-based intrusion detection system. Section 4 provides the experimental results and discussion, while Section 5 concludes the paper and highlights potential areas for future research.

The paper references Marti et al.'s work on enhancing the Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) protocol with two extensions, Watchdog and Pathrater, which detect and avoid routes with misbehaving nodes. However, it notes that these methods do not punish or create disincentives for misbehaving nodes.

Buchegger et al. propose the CONFIDANT protocol, which relies on nodes monitoring their neighbors' behavior and sharing reputation ratings. A reputation system updates these ratings, which influence routing decisions. However, this method is vulnerable to the dissemination of false ratings by malicious nodes.

The paper also discusses Sen's survey on security issues in wireless mesh networks, and the game-theoretic model by Das et al., which identifies selfish nodes in MANETs but does not account for malicious ones. Taheri et al. offer a game theory-based method to detect malicious nodes by analyzing game components and data transfer history, while Wang et al. introduce a mean field game theory approach for security in cognitive radio MANETs, aimed at extending network lifetime and reducing compromise risks.

Janusz et al. review various algorithms such as swarm intelligence and evolutionary games to boost cybersecurity in MANETs, considering basic defense techniques for intrusion detection and prevention. Lastly, Subba et al. propose a detection framework using lightweight neural networks, with a reputation management mechanism inspired by Shapley values and the Vickrey–Clarke–Groves (VCG) mechanism to encourage cooperation and reduce malicious behavior, achieving high detection rates against different attacks.
