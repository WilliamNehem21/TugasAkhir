In previous works, we introduced a Petri net-based model for systems that are concurrent, mobile, and ubiquitous, which we termed Mobile Synchronizing Petri Nets (MSPN). Petri nets offer user-friendly visual representations along with a robust theoretical framework. Additionally, they have several attractive decidability properties due to not being Turing-complete, unlike more expressive models, which often don't have these properties. Although various Petri net-based models for mobility have been proposed, none so far have addressed security, a critical element in this context to the best of our knowledge.

We explored the expressiveness of MSPN and established several decidability results, including the decidability of coverability, that may be applied to defining security properties like integrity and confidentiality. To verify these properties, we chose rewriting logic as our framework, which is naturally suited for handling distributed and concurrent systems, and efficiently implemented in the Maude programming language, a tool used for realizing various concurrency formalisms.

We acknowledge an algorithm to ascertain coverability in MSPN systems, albeit recognizing its lack of efficiency. The inefficiency largely stems from the exponential growth of predecessor markings encountered during backward analysis, despite our utilization of an ideal-based representation for marking sets. We are committed to further investigating the complexity of this algorithm and are currently considering a shift to forward analysis, which may enhance algorithmic efficiency as previously evidenced. Additionally, we anticipate complementing this method with the introduction of abstractions or tailored type systems, which, although rendering our analysis incomplete, could make it more practical in certain scenarios.
