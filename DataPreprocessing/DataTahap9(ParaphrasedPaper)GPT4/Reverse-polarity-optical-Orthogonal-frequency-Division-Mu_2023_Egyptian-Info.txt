This academic paper examines the impact of wireless communications on global integration, considering aspects such as technology, economy, government, and institutions. The paper addresses the challenges posed by radio spectrum congestion due to technological advances and population density increase, emphasizing the need for alternative spectrum utilization to maintain seamless wireless coverage and capacity. The development of high-speed wireless communication infrastructure is essential to meet the growing demand for wireless services.

One of the issues discussed involves the use of visible light communication (VLC) for wireless transmission. VLC requires innovative approaches for signal processing and channel estimation, as traditional methods for radio waves do not apply directly to the visible spectrum. The paper investigates the history and techniques for dimming control in VLC, which is important for ensuring reliable communication even in low-light conditions. Analogue dimming, which uses continuous current reduction (CCR) to dim LED lighting, directly impacts the LED's chromaticity. Digital modulation techniques like pulse-width modulation (PWM), pulse-position modulation (PPM), and pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM) have been employed, alongside orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-based methods such as DCO-OFDM and ACO-OFDM.

The research introduces a digital PWM dimming approach called RPO-OFDM, which integrates the transmitted data into the light. Simulations, conducted in MATLAB 2021(a), investigate optical attenuation and perceived LED brightness when employing different OFDM-based dimming techniques. The proposed RPO-OFDM approach avoids clipping the ACO-OFDM signal and uses the LED's full dynamic range, which helps reduce noise and increases spectrum efficiency or reliability.

Further discussion in the paper outlines the mathematical considerations for the performance of RPO-OFDM, leveraging the principles of the Lagrange function and the Hessian matrix for optimization. Power efficiency of RPO-OFDM is compared to other methods, with RPO-OFDM showing superior power distribution and a lower implementation cost due to its optimized design. Lastly, the paper examines the effect of VLC dimming on bit error rate (BER) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), finding that RPO-OFDM maintains higher performance even at lower duty cycles for PWM.
