After conducting an extensive review of the literature, it has been found that when sulfonamide and amide compounds are linked in various ways, they demonstrate a range of biological activities. These activities include acting as carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, displaying antimycobacterial properties, functioning as receptor modulators such as sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor agonists, and serving as 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 inhibitors, which can be used to treat metabolic disorders. Compounds that merge sulfonamide with 1,2,4-triazoles, 1,3,4-thiadiazoles, and 1,3,4-oxadiazoles have been identified as possible antibacterial and antifungal agents. Additionally, derivatives that combine the sulfonamide and amide groups exhibit selective inhibition of SIRT2, an enzyme associated with aging and metabolism.

The research suggests that compounds featuring a coupling of benzene sulfonamide and phenyl amide might have significant potential in anticancer treatments. As a result, new compounds that merge benzene sulfonamide with phenyl amide at the meta position of the benzene ring have been synthesized. To make the synthesis process more accessible, reaction conditions have been simplified, allowing for the avoidance of expensive reagents and complex purification processes, while still achieving good purity of the final products.

The paper reports on the synthesis of novel sulfonamide derivatives with the intention to explore their anticancer properties. The methods utilized for the preparation of these compounds (labeled 4a through 4u) are detailed within a schematic.

In the described workup process, the reaction mix was treated with cold 2N aqueous hydrochloric acid and stirred for 30 minutes, which caused solids to precipitate out in the intermediates stage. These solids were filtered and washed with cold diethyl ether and cold pentane, resulting in white solids. The yield of solid obtained from these procedures typically ranged from 70% to 80%. Additionally, by extracting the remaining aqueous layer with dichloromethane (DCM) and evaporating it, researchers were able to increase the final yields to between 80% and 90% for all the intermediates.
