Molecules like nucleic acids and proteins are stable enough to be viewed as basic units, called agents, with specific interaction points known as sites, for example, where binding or other modifications occur. These sites facilitate the formation of weak bonds between molecules, and together with the agents, they compose site graphs, which represent the network-like structures of molecular complexes.

In rule-based modeling, traditional chemical reactions are substituted with more versatile rules that target patterns in the structure of chemical species rather than the entire species itself. This allows a single rule to encompass numerous reactions. However, commonly used rule-based languages don't support the explicit description of molecular geometry and linkages in three-dimensional space, rendering the modeling of physical constraints on molecular interactions a challenge.

We introduce a minimalist enhancement to the kappa language, named geometrically enhanced kappa. In this version, the molecules are still described by site graphs that are transformed through rewriting rules, but now there are additional geometric annotations—radii, positions, and orientations for agents, sites, and links—that provide implicit constraints on the molecular structures. The rewrite rules can now include changes to these annotations to represent changes in molecular shape, such as during folding.

Our geometric annotation focuses on ensuring the geometric feasibility of the molecular complexes without dealing with their motion in space. We don’t track the absolute movement of molecules, so processes like diffusion or collisions are not considered explicitly. We assume that the mixture of molecules is well-stirred, as with the traditional kappa language without geometric concerns.

Others, like Gruenert et al., have approached the simulation of complex chemical systems by merging particle-based spatial simulation with a rule-based language that includes the spatial aspects of molecular interactions and motion, unlike our approach which does not account for individual particle movement.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces geometrically enhanced kappa and its associated simulation algorithms. Section 3 discusses 'locality,' illustrating the challenges of deciding whether kappa models are local or non-local, and proposes ways to simplify local models into ones without geometric data. Section 4 concludes with final thoughts and areas for future research.

We build on the classic kappa language by adding new geometric dimensions to create a categorical language. This enhancement allows for checking the geometric soundness of site graphs, though the specific geometric configurations are not actively maintained or used in the model's dynamics. Future developments could include incorporating such spatial information to simulate processes like diffusion and compartmentalization, which are important in certain biochemical settings. The scope of possible extensions to kappa ranges from traditional, geometry-less versions to more complex spatial models that closely resemble molecular dynamics simulations.
