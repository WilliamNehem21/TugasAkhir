To thoroughly understand the aerodynamic characteristics of conductors with typical shapes when coated with ice, a detailed theoretical analysis was conducted. Experimental investigations in a wind tunnel were performed to study the dynamic characteristics of iced conductors under varying ice thicknesses and wind speeds. The paper presents a systematic analysis of the aerodynamic parameter characteristics for different iced conductor conditions.

The experiments were conducted in a small-scale wind tunnel with dimensions of 1.4 x 1.4 meters. This tunnel has an open-type closed test section, and the wind speed ranged from 10 to 65 meters per second. A three-component balance (FGC03A/FGC3B) was used to measure the forces, while a PXI system handled data acquisition. Additionally, an industrial control computer managed the measurement of the angle of attack and static pressure related to the flow speed.
