This paper discusses the close relationship between cooperation, trust, and security in pervasive and autonomous computing systems, which comprise various entities that need to work together to attain specific objectives. Trust between entities commonly dictates their willingness to collaborate, and this paper explores how formal modeling and analysis of both security and trust can be integrated within a single framework.

The authors present a framework designed to uniformly model both security protocols and trust/reputation management processes, such as Automated Trust Negotiation (ATN). The framework establishes that methodologies for fostering, managing, and negotiating trust are tightly connected to the security measures that ensure the confidentiality and integrity of information.

In this framework, cryptographic operations are represented algebraically, where an encryption of a message 'm' with a key 'k' is depicted as 'mk,' and decryption requires access to the corresponding decryption key.

The aim is to incorporate trust-related features within an existing security framework, which is especially fitting for dynamic, interconnected systems. In conventional security protocol analysis, assumptions are made that public keys, digital certificates, and credentials are pre-established, without considering their formation, negotiation, or management. However, in such dynamic systems, access to resources often depends on the credentials users present.

The paper suggests that credentials can be weighted to express the degree of trust an entity has in another with respect to performing a function 'f,' with the specifics of calculating trust values depending on particular inference rules.

Once the modeling of both security and trust management is achieved within the same framework, it becomes possible to easily connect different concepts. For example, the authors show that the concept of privacy in trust negotiation is related to a well-known security concept called non-interference.

Furthermore, Li et al.'s RT family of languages for trust relationship management is highlighted. In these languages, credentials embody policy information that helps define the attributes of principals based on assertions from other principals. RT language merges the benefits of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)—through the role-based assignment of permissions—and trust management, which involves handling distributed authority via credentials.
