The paper discusses an algorithmic method for identifying areas of uncertainty along the edges of points in a profile analysis that looks at variations in eight different directions. To determine whether variations are significant, the algorithm uses three predefined constants – [ti, to, ts] – that depend on the comparison of the maximum, minimum, and average deviation values between two profile readings. In areas where the variation surpasses a specific threshold, the algorithm categorizes the pixel data differently, separating potential points of interest from what is likely the background or the rail itself. This distinction is made at each iterative step, t, and the data is filled into distinct matrices: {si} and {gi} for points of interest, as opposed to {s} and {g} for background and rail, respectively.

Additionally, you’ve provided two references to publications by Guerrieri M., and Ticali D, which discuss sustainable transport in park areas and the conversion of disused railway lines into greenways. The references are from conference proceedings of the International Conference on Sustainable Design and Construction held in 2011. These references do not directly relate to the algorithm description, so they would need to be put into context within the broader scope of the paper or research they are associated with.
