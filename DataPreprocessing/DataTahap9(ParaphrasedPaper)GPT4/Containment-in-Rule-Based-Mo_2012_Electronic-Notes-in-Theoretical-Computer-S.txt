Recently, interest has grown in tackling the complex combinatorial challenges posed by biochemical systems through rule-based modeling, such as the kappa language. This has led to the creation of novel analyses and prompted efforts to enhance the language's capabilities. The current paper expands on previous work that assigned kappa a semantics based on single-pushout (SPO) rewriting, incorporating the concept of containment structure to better represent the containment and division of biological mixtures by membranes.

Rule-based modeling systems like kappa and BioNetGen have been used to manage the complexity of biological systems. As a result, there is a drive to extend the expressiveness of these systems to encompass more intricate biological structures.

The division of space within cells is crucial as it can lead to vastly different concentrations and chemical behaviors across compartments, which cells often exploit through concentration gradients. The dynamics of a cell's evolution depend heavily on the location of reactions, and cellular structures are dynamicâ€”compartments can form, dissolve, merge, or split.

Kappa models traditionally approximate the complexity of eukaryotic cells by assuming biochemical networks operate in a homogeneously mixed solution, without significant spatial structure. In this paper, we explain how we can integrate the dynamics of containment structure with kappa, enabling models to reflect both stochastic chemistry and structural changes. We then a offer preliminary view of ongoing and potential research based on this updated model.

Kappa is best understood as a way to model a well-mixed solution as complexes of interacting agents, with agents representing proteins or molecules and their functional sites engaging in binary links. The behavior of these complexes is described by rules modeled as locally affecting the solution based on a set pattern.

We developed our semantics by identifying structures that represent kappa's states and rules, with morphisms that preserve structure. Using this as a basis, we introduce partial maps and establish categories of matchings and actions, allowing us to represent rules and their applications to mixtures. Applying a rule results in creating a 'pushout' from the action morphism against this matching, and we show that such pushouts always exist.

Our model simplifies real biological complexity, focusing on membranes that encircle well-mixed regions where the exact shape is irrelevant. We view the cell or a subsystem as a series of regions, each potentially containing other areas, and treat each region's contents as well-mixed, applying standard mass-action dynamics to model compartments within compartments.

Our model dictates that the action maps must fully cover all regions, although they do not have to maintain the containment relationships between them. For instance, moving a membrane with its contents from one overarching membrane to another inside it demonstrates the specificity of our containment structure.

By adding a simple dynamics of regions to kappa's semantics, we create a more representative biological modeling language capable of simulating compartments. Several paths await exploration in future research endeavors.
