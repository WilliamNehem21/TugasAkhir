The paper presents a strategic programming framework called "tl," which enables the dynamic construction of higher-order strategic expressions for program transformation problems. This research is supported in part by the United States Department of Energy and the NSF.

The authors address the challenge of distributing data throughout term structures, which is a common issue in the domain of program transformation. While stratego and elan are existing strategic programming systems that are failure-based, tl is an identity-based system that leaves the term unchanged upon unsuccessful rule application.

The framework of tl includes higher-order rules, strategies, and traversals, which can be applied to solve the union benchmark by elevating basic data operations to the strategy level. tl facilitates the creation of strategies to manage specific problem requirements, such as a strategy that employs transient application during top-down traversal to rename variables only once within a given scope.

The paper details how tl handles program transformations like inlining function calls and renaming variables. The tl framework's parsing expressions are either ground (without schema variables) or non-ground (with schema variables). It outlines custom user-defined higher-order traversals in addition to providing standard ones, offering four degrees of freedom regarding how terms are traversed.

Overall, the focus of the paper is on higher-order extensions to strategic programming, and how tl's capabilities can effectively tackle program transformation challenges by manipulating and distributing data within term structures. The examples discussed in the paper have been implemented in the HATS 3 system, underscoring the practical application of the tl framework.
