Ribenboim proposed a concept called generalized power series, aiming to explore rings of arithmetic functions, though the idea is broadly applicable, providing numerous examples. This construction is systematic and can be examined through the lens of category theory. Ribenboim’s work starts with a subset of partially ordered monoids, termed as strict pomonoids. He investigates those mappings from a pomonoid to a ring where the preimage of the non-zero elements—the "support"—is both artinian and narrow, concepts defined within the work. His results show that the Dirichlet convolution formula can be extended to this framework, generating a type of ring analogous to a ring of power series.

Regarding theorem 4.1, while the construction seems functorial, a challenge arises when mapping from the category of partially ordered sets to any considered categories of finiteness spaces; not all order-preserving maps preserve the Noetherian property. This issue is resolved by focusing on strict maps.

For instance, in the context of formal power series (Example 5.2), consider a set 'A' as an alphabet. Then, the free monoid 'M' created from 'A' forms a finiteness space, complete with a monoidal structure recognizable in finiteness space categories. The critical aspect is confirming that the product operation remains valid within this construction.

The method of differentiation, a key operation on power series rings, raises the question of whether it's possible to differentiate Ribenboim's generalized power series. Specifically, within the commutative case, the category of linearized finiteness spaces demonstrated one of the initial instances of differential categories, which were instrumental in examining models of differential linear logic. Exploring the differentiation of these generalized series and understanding how they integrate into the framework of differential categories is a promising area of research.
