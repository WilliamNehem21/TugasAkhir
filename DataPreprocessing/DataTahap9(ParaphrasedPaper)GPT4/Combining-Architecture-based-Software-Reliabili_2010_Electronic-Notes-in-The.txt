Software breakdowns can incur significant expenses for users, yet current software reliability estimation models fail to quantify this financial burden effectively. Our methodology marks a pioneering effort to merge the realms of IT and business in the realm of reliability forecasting, advocating for the consideration of failure impact early in the software development lifecycle.

We commence by modeling crucial business operations alongside their IT underpinnings, correlating them with potential failure probabilities to evaluate both reliability and related costs, demonstrated through a practical example.

For empirical validation, we apply our framework to an industrial maintenance system from ABB, employing the Palladio Component Model (PCM) due to its unique integration of software and hardware failure analysis and parameter-driven service interactions, reliant on component usage profiles and failure odds.

Our proposed two-stage process begins with crafting a model of the business processes and interfacing IT systems, followed by infusing these layers with reliability data and cost details for comprehensive cost analytics.

Using PCM notations, we map out IT infrastructure failure information crucial for business operations. By introducing software component failure rates and hardware availability data, we can calculate process variant probabilities via system reliability.

We then convert the PCM model into a discrete-time Markov chain to estimate system reliability, entailing failure odds differentiation. This aids in forecasting the expected costs by amalgamating select failure probabilities with cost data to aid in design comparisons.

Employing BPMN, developed by the Object Management Group for business process modeling, we can enrich the process steps with cost intelligence. While we omit BPMN specifics due to space constraints, we focus on the costliest failures, prioritizing the most economically influential ones over negligible scenarios.

PCM is utilized for IT layer modeling to assess software architecture performance and reliability. By specifying failure likelihoods and hardware availability metrics (MTTF and MTTR), PCM facilitates a thorough reliability evaluation, with future enhancements intended to discriminate between different failure types.

Illustrating our methodology through a case study, we progressively model the business and IT layers, infuse them with cost data, and evaluate overall reliability to calculate expected extra costs.

While our method provides a computational blueprint to factor in reliability and expense for end-users, it currently omits repair action effects, fault tolerance mechanisms, and failure propagation delays, identified as beyond the business user's immediate control.

Acknowledging that no existing model satisfactorily bridges system reliability and failure-induced costs from the user's perspective, our approach spotlights cost repercussions associated with IT service reliability hinged upon established techniques.

In essence, our strategy equips users to foresee and contrast the fiscal fallout of software malfunctions across various designs and steers developers towards recognizing business segments sensitive to IT layer reliability. This insight into cost ramifications enables the focus on strategic optimizations.

Looking ahead, our goals include refining the method via automated failure scenario analyses and more detailed financial assessments, like integrating key performance indicators and handling process decisions more effectively. Our approach remains nascent, with further formalization and sophistication in the pipeline.
