The paper describes a computational framework called "finite Eilenberg machines" which abstracts various types of data structures and computational models commonly used in theoretical computer science such as automata and push-down automata. It also incorporates binary relations as a representation of non-determinism. This framework allows for the translation of several standard computational models into a unified formâ€”Eilenberg machines.

For the verification of their framework's correctness, the authors employ an inductive argument based on multi-set ordering involving three mutually recursive predicates. Due to the complexity of ensuring their simulation terminates correctly, they utilize a proof assistant called Coq, which is equipped with an extension for programming, to both specify the Eilenberg machines and provide a mechanically checked proof of the simulation's termination and correctness.

Key functions like `react`, `choose`, and `continue` are detailed to demonstrate their respective roles in the simulation. `react` evaluates if a state is terminal before generating an output, `choose` engages in a non-deterministic search for transitions, and `continue` is responsible for managing backtracking within the exploration process. These functions are designed to be free of side-effects, tail-recursive, and utilize resumption as a form of continuation.

The correctness of these functions is assured when given well-formed inputs, as predetermined by the predicate H1. Predicate H2 ensures the validity of a list of transitions used by the `choose` function. Termination is guaranteed by an 'accessibility predicate' present in predicate H, with 'wfrext' being used to indicate that recursive calls progressively work on smaller arguments.

Theoretical aspects of this work employ the Calculus of Inductive Constructions, a form of higher-order logic ideal for abstract mathematical proofs, and contemplations on computational objects. Distinguishing between logical properties (using sort "prop") and computational objects (using sort "set") in Coq's language allows the extraction of a concrete program from the logical specifications.

Finally, the paper highlights that they have successfully executed the Coq proof assistant to verify the soundness and completeness of their simulation's correctness concerning finite Eilenberg machines. They also point out that the extracted Coq program closely resembles a version written in the programming language OCaml as described in other works related to finite Eilenberg machines.
