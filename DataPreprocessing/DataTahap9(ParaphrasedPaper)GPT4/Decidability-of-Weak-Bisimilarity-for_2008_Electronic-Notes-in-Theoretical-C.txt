An extension that would enable us to overcome the limitation to normed processes within the findings of this study remains elusive. Should we manage to establish the unique decomposability theorem, the decidability of the entire class of BPA processes would be attainable. Unfortunately, a proof for the theorem has not yet been formulated.
