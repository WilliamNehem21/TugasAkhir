In the academic paper, an algorithm processes a component named 'q'. As it traverses this component, it marks the first intersection vertex that comes next, named i1, as an exit point. Following that, the subsequent intersection vertex, i2, is designated as an entry point, and this alternating labeling continues in the same manner. Regarding a different component, denoted as 'p', the algorithm identifies the first vertex of its second part, p6, situated outside of q. Consequently, the intersecting vertices along this component, i5 and i6, are labeled as entry and exit points, respectively, and similar labeling is applied to subsequent vertices. For the structure 'q', the algorithm finds that q1 is positioned outside of 'p' and then marks the intersection vertex i2 (affiliated with q) as an entry point. It continues to label i7, another intersection vertex, as an exit point. This pattern of labeling is carried on for the subsequent vertices.
