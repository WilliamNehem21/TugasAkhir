The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that mental health disorders affect one in four people globally, with over 280 million of different ages experiencing depression. In Bangladesh, mental illness prevalence ranges from 6.5% to 31.0% among adults and 13.4% to 22.9% among children. Over 7 million people, mainly from urban regions, suffer from depression and anxiety in Bangladesh.

The structure of the article is as follows: Section 2 reviews related literature, Section 3 discusses the methodology, Section 4 presents results, Section 5 reflects on how findings met research goals, Section 6 examines limitations, and Section 7 provides conclusions and future work directions.

Recent developments in AI and machine learning have led to various studies on depression and anxiety detection, using both private and public datasets. Different research groups have employed machine learning models and techniques in different populations, achieving varying levels of success. For example, Nemesure's team used ensemble models to predict depression in undergraduate students, and Lee and Kim applied machine learning to American adults' depressive behavior data from NHANES. Machine learning models have also been used to predict depression in stroke survivors and children in various studies.

In Bangladesh, detection of depression using local datasets is an area of growing research. Teams have employed deep learning and machine learning algorithms, using different questionnaires and feature selection methods, to predict depression with varying degrees of accuracy.

Research on university students in Bangladesh has identified various factors contributing to depression, such as relationship issues, sleep and diet patterns, and socioeconomic status. In exploring the efficacy of predicting depression, new assessment scales have been created based on existing scales. Machine learning and deep learning models have been fine-tuned using feature selection and hyperparameter optimization techniques to improve prediction accuracy, with a focus on retaining the most relevant features.
