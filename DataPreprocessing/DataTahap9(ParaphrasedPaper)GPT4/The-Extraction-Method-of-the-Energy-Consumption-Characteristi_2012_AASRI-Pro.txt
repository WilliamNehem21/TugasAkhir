The academic paper discusses the complexities of large coal-fired power systems, which have intricate structures, exhibit high interconnectivity, and display non-linear interactions between energy consumption and factors such as the external environment, available resources, and power demand. It presents the use of a fuzzy rough set (FRS) approach for attribute reduction, which helps identify critical features that influence energy consumption, while also discarding non-essential features. By using these simplified attributes as input variables, the method lays the groundwork for analyzing coal-fired power units' energy usage.

The paper describes the power generation system as being composed of numerous complex sub-systems with multi-dimensional, non-linear associations between different operating parameters. Defining these relationships under various operational conditions is key to reconstructing the system's operating state. Once this is accomplished, optimal controllable boundary parameters can be identified, leading to the development of strategies to optimize operations. This process is part of complex system modeling analysis.

Ultimately, the paper highlights that 10 attributes derived from the fuzzy rough set attribute reduction algorithm were selected as input variables. The findings adhere to the theoretical analysis, pinpointing that the vital parameters impacting energy consumption of the units are the boundary condition parameters during operation. This methodology provides a crucial foundation for further research into optimizing consumption characteristics and operating parameters of coal-fired power units.
