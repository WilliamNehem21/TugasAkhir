Automobile manufacturers are increasingly using the VANET (Vehicular Ad-hoc Network) framework to enhance in-car comfort and safety features. However, handling efficient data transmission in VANET is challenging due to the high mobility of vehicles. As vehicles rapidly pass through internet gateways and exit the wireless range, they frequently disconnect from the network. A link reliability model helps predict the probability of future link formation and disruption among vehicles in the network.

Yi et al. investigated the Security-Aware Ad hoc Routing (SAR) protocol, which relies on trust relationships and values to establish network integrity. The results showcased a varying amount of data packets handled by unauthorized and malicious nodes, highlighting weaknesses in the ad hoc network's security.

Sanzgiri et al. proposed the Authenticated Routing for Ad hoc Networks (ARAN), which uses cryptographic certificates to enhance security. ARAN shows similar effectiveness as AODV (Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector) in route maintenance and discovery but incurs higher overhead due to larger packet sizes.

Shurman et al. introduced a method enabling the source node to verify the authenticity of nodes forwarding route reply (RREP) messages, thus identifying the safest route. Despite its innovation, this approach caused increased routing delays, which ranged from mere nanoseconds to much higher timescales, and only addressed single-node, not group attacks.

To overcome group attacks, Dokurer et al. suggested disregarding the first RREP to prevent black hole attacks, hypothesizing that it might come from an attacker. However, this method was still vulnerable as it did not consider malicious second RREP messages, lacking proactive attacker removal from the network.

Vehicular networks are susceptible to various attacks, such as eavesdropping, information leakage, grey hole, black hole, wormhole, and denial of serviceâ€”with the focus here on black hole attacks. To analyze these, the freeway mobility model was utilized to replicate vehicle movement on highways in simulations. The proposed algorithm's performance, tested in the NCTUns simulation environment, was compared against AODV, DSR, and BAODV (AODV under black hole attack) across different simulation parameters.
