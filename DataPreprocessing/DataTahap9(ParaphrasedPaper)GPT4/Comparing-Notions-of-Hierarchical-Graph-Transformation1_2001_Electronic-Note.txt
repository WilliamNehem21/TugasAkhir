Habel, A., MÃ¼ller, J., and Plump, D. revisited double pushout (DPO) graph transformation in their work. They presented their insights in a selected collection of papers from the Theory and Application of Graph Transformation (TAGT'98), edited by G. Engels and G. Rozenberg. This compilation is part of the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series, volume 1764, published by Springer in 2000, and the specific coverage of their work appears on pages 103 to 116. The paper presumably elaborates on the DPO approach to graph transformation, updating the methodology or providing new perspectives on its application and theoretical foundation.
