The issue of whether all separable Banach spaces possess a basis was raised by Banach in 1932. It took four decades until Enflo provided a negative answer to this question by demonstrating the existence of a Banach space that does not satisfy the Approximation Property (AP). The Approximation Property is a characteristic of a Banach space whereby the identity operator can be uniformly approximated on any compact subset by operators of finite rank. It has been established that a Banach space with a basis will always exhibit the Approximation Property.
