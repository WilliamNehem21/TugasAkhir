This paper addresses the modification of tabular forms for program specifications using a graph grammar known as the Hierarchical Node Connecting Grammar (HNGG). The authors extend the concept of the Cornell Program Synthesizer by incorporating attribute-enhanced node connecting graph grammars to formalize syntax-directed editing techniques. They discuss in detail the algorithms underpinning these editing approaches.

The act of mechanically altering tabular forms is a key issue within the domain of software engineering methodology. The Cornell Program Synthesizer is recognized as a structured, text-based editor that skillfully employs attribute grammars. Tabular forms are illustrated via several models, with the elements of a table corresponding to attributed nodes within the structure. The logical sequence and placement of table items are captured using graph grammars because tables can contain an indefinite number of items that carry meaningful sequences.

The premise here is that the mechanical manipulation of tabular forms can be efficiently achieved through the syntactic handling of graphs. The inner configuration of each tabular form is defined by an attribute-enhanced node connecting graph grammar (ANCGG). The unique forms, termed HiForm, are outlined by graphs generated by this grammar.

The authors propose an editing approach for tabular forms that are uniform in cell size, founded on the attribute-enhanced node connecting graph grammar. This method includes attribute rules specifically for mechanical drawing, allowing for the precise editing of valid tabular forms determined by the Enhanced NCGG. They also describe a linear-time editing algorithm that is based on attribute rules for fundamental drawing tasks.

The paper suggests that these syntactic editing methods could be adapted for the syntactic manipulation of spreadsheet languages. The authors state that they are refining the attribute rules for more complex drawings and exploring additional editing manipulations such as splitting and merging operations. Moreover, they mention the ongoing development of a dedicated editor system for handling tabular forms.
