In this paper, the authors investigate the spin current and the electric field induced by spin currents in a quantum wire with Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling. By using electron wave-functions and the concept of spin current, they calculate both linear and angular spin current densities along with the corresponding induced electric fields. They discover that there are two significant components of linear spin current density that peak in the nanowire's center, and their magnitudes can be manipulated by altering the number of propagating modes and the Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling strength. Furthermore, the study reveals that for a quantum wire with Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling, one can detect an electric field induced by the spin current, which presents a potential method for measuring spin currents.
