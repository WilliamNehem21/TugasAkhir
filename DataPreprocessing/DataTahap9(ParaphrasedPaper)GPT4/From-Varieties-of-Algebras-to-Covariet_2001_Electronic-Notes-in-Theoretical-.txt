The academic paper discusses the complete characterization of certain mathematical structures, specifically covarietors, on sets by identifying conditions under which they may have arbitrarily large fixed points. While a comprehensive description of covarietors on sets remains elusive, the paper cites contributions by M. Barr and Y. Kawahara with M. Mori who have identified conditions that are adequate for verifying covarietors. According to Barr, every accessible functor qualifies as a covarietor, and Kawahara and Mori extend this understanding by demonstrating that every bounded functor also meets the criteria to be considered a covarietor.
