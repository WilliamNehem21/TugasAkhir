This paper investigates the pharmacognostic features of Achyranthes coynei Santapau (Amaranthaceae), a plant endemic to India and used in traditional medicine. The study represents the first of its kind for A. coynei, which is important for its identification and authentication. The plant has a thick-walled epidermis with apex; its vascular bundles are conjoint, collateral, closed, and endarch. The ground tissue contains rosette crystals of calcium oxalate.
 
Leaf samples, including petioles, were collected from Madhanbhavi, Belgaum District, Karnataka, and a voucher specimen was stored at the Regional Medical Research Centre, Belgaum, for reference. The study included the estimation of total ash, acid-insoluble ash, and water-soluble ash, which are indicative of the inorganic and silica components. The ash content was found to be in the same range as that of A. aspera, as reported in the Ayurvedic Pharmacopeia. Additionally, phytochemical screening revealed the presence of possible antibacterial and antioxidant components such as alkaloids, saponins, and triterpenoids.

The leaf powder displayed fluorescence under different solvents, suggesting a variety of chemical constituents that reflect under ultraviolet light and various reagents. High-performance thin-layer chromatographic (HPTLC) analysis identified eight bands in the leaf extract, with a significant band matching the Rf value (0.53) and blue color characteristic of oleanolic acid, a compound known for its medicinal properties, which was also identified in a previous study using HPLC methods.

The authors thank the director-in-charge at the Regional Medical Research Centre, the HPTLC facility providers, and research assistants who contributed to the study. Recognition is also given to the Indian Council of Medical Research, New Delhi, for providing a senior research fellowship for the study.
