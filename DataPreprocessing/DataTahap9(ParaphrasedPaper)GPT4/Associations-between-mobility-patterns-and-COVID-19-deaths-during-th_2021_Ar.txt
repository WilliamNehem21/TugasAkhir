Findings: The study identifies significant correlations between COVID-19 case and death numbers with mobility trends in retail, recreation, and workplaces. It's the first to use a network structure and rank propagation model analyzing COVID-19 and mobility patterns, highlighting socio-economic and demographic factors. This method helps cluster counties for targeted policy action, demonstrating each county's unique contribution to national figures.

Background: As of January 16, 2021, COVID-19 has claimed over two million lives globally. First detected in China in December 2019, it swiftly spread, resulting in a pandemic declaration in March 2020. Western Europe was notably affected.

Ireland's First Case: Ireland reported its initial case on February 17, 2020, after a woman returned from Italy exhibiting typical symptoms. By early 2021, cases rose to 147,613, with a high 14-day notification rate and over 2,300 deaths, predominantly affecting the elderly.

Data and Models: The research utilized Google's mobility reports to understand changes in movement and link them to COVID-19 trends. Various algorithms, including SVM, RF, KNN, and NNs, have been deployed for COVID-19 predictions, but this study's unique approach focuses on intra-country mobility influences.

Risk Factors: Certain mobility trends, especially within buildings and urban environments, were highlighted as high-risk for virus spread. Research has shown construction sites may see severe workforce reductions under high-risk conditions.

Shopper Safety: The retail sector's focus on consumer safety relates directly to the implementation of protective measures like hand sanitisation, occupancy limits, and social distancing.

Algorithmic Approach: This study utilized personalized PageRank scores to estimate mobility trend significance per county linked to cases and deaths. Relative importance factors were calculated, clustering counties for result visualization.

Data Collection and Methodology: The research collected and pre-processed smartphone mobility data and applied algorithms to decipher interrelationships and cluster findings for practical policy guidance.

Limitations and Errors: The study acknowledges potential errors stemming from noise in the data but asserts that the consistency of the method outweighs these concerns.

Impact on Counties: Different counties demonstrated variability in the significance of mobility categories, influencing local policy measures. Retail and recreation typically dominated infection determinants, with parks being significant in certain rural areas.

Policy Implications: The research suggests tailored confinement measures and improved communication strategies for public health compliance that reflect local circumstances and socio-cultural factors.

Future Research: The paper recommends further exploration of PageRank-related algorithms for pandemic data and the continued sharing of private data for public interest research.
