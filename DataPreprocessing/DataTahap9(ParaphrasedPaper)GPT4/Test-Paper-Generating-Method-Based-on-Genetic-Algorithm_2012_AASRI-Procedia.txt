The significance of ongoing education for individuals who have entered the workforce is highlighted, as it enhances their skills and expertise. To bypass traditional test paper generation hurdles, this paper explores the use of genetic algorithms for automated test paper creation. The paper outlines the design process of the test paper generation system employing genetic algorithms, examining and establishing various parameter settings. The implementation demonstrates genetic algorithms as an efficient mechanism for this purpose.

The proposed system serves as an automated test-designing expert, crafting papers based on criteria such as the number and type of questions, difficulty level, and knowledge covered. Conventional test generation methods often get trapped in suboptimal solutions and demonstrate slow problem-solving convergence. In contrast, this paper introduces a superior, intelligence-based paper generation method utilizing genetic algorithms. These algorithms are dynamic, robust search processes initially introduced in Bagay's 1967 doctoral thesis and officially adopted in 1975 following Holland's endorsement. A typical genetic algorithm operates with a set of data structuresâ€”individuals that each present a potential solution to a given problem.
