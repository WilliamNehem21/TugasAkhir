In this academic paper, a new model for guarded recursion and clocks is presented, demonstrating that synchronizing different clocks is indeed safe for the calculus concerned. This development simplifies the type theory involved by eliminating the need for conditions that ensure the 'freshness' of various elements in the typing rules. This advancement is an essential step forward in defining rewrite semantics and is a critical component for the future implementation of the calculus.

Remark 3.18 reiterates that while the interpretation of guarded recursion with respect to clocks follows established norms, as seen in sources like Jacobs, it is essential to highlight the importance of having a general clock substitution mechanism, denoted as gr(f), where f can be any function. This capability was absent in previous models, leading to limitations in the rules governing how clocks could be instantiated. This paper addresses and rectifies those limitations, presumably removing previous constraints.
