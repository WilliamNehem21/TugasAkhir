In recent times, the Internet of Things (IoT) has gained prominent attention with its applications spanning various sectors. IoT primarily aims to integrate diverse objects, including devices with RFID, sensors, and more, allowing individuals to leverage the data these objects generate to enhance their daily lives. Given that these objects can be spatially and temporally diverse, the access rights to their information can vary based on both location and time. Therefore, it's crucial for IoT access control mechanisms to account for such spatiotemporal factors to bolster security.

Notably, existing access control frameworks in IoT often prioritize authentication but overlook comprehensive models. Previous research largely focuses on specific solutions for certain security challenges within IoT systems. For instance, Benenson et al. have discussed defending against node capture by collaborating sensor nodes, and Shen has introduced schemes based on one-way key chains and Merkle hash trees. While various studies pinpoint important contributions, there remains a scarcity of generalized access control models tailored for IoT environments.

In our study, we introduce a novel framework termed the Location-Temporal Access Control Model (LTAC), which intertwines both location and time with security levels to regulate information access within the sensing layer of IoT systems. The LTAC is designed around a lattice structure to streamline policy bases. We explain how the model components interlink with location data and how this information is instrumental in determining access permissions for subjects to objects.

We define a set of calendar times, CT, where any two instances are inherently comparable, meaning any two times either precede or follow each other. In the context of IoT, time constraints can manifest as earliest access times, latest access times, and other related temporal boundaries. In this paper, we specifically focus on formalizing the constructs of the earliest access time (EAT) and the latest finish time (LFT) to implement our proposed time-aware access controls.
