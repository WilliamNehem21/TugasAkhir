The paper discusses the exploration of organic architecture in organizations, which adapts to future access needs similarly to self-organized ad-hoc networks. Traditional data storage networks, congested with heavy engineering and massive resource requirements, have made it difficult to innovate in this space. However, newer methods, such as organic clusters of low-cost, replicable data storage systems, offer resilience against physical security threats. These systems, made of independent pods, can withstand partial damage by redistributing workloads, and stored data is protected with robust encryption.

The paper outlines an experimental study where an organic cluster system is compared to a traditional storage area network over a year in a production environment. The cluster's low-power requirement opens the possibility of sustainable energy use, like solar panels. Design science research methodology is applied to create an artifact, a tangible solution to the identified need, which undergoes iterative design, testing, and revision.

Initial trials with virtual and physical lab machines confirmed the reliability of the GlusterFS system. The study proceeded with deploying nodes on low-powered AtomicPi computers running Linux Mint, formatted with XFS for efficient handling of large files. SSH and optional encryption with LUKS cryptfs were enabled for secure remote access.

Tests included increasing network load, implementing a round-robin DNS load balancer, and rebooting nodes to assess automatic discovery and synchronization. Performance was measured before and after these system reboots.

The findings indicate a shift in technological needs that could move organizations away from cloud storage towards local or hybrid solutions, driven by desires for data security and local data access, alongside the potential advantages for developing countries leveraging eco-friendly power sources. This could signify a trend of data repatriation to local infrastructures from cloud computing due to concerns around privacy, cost, or performance.
