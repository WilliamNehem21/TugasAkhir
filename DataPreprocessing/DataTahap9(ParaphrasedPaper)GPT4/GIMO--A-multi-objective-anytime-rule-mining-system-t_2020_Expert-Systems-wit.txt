Some data mining methods generate models too complex to be understood by domain experts. Models such as support vector machines or neural networks are inherently difficult to interpret, while others, like decision trees or rules, can vary in understandability based on their complexity.

A significant consideration for human experts is the cost of incorrect classifications. Many algorithms do not incorporate cost sensitivity, or they require a pre-defined cost matrix, which might not accurately reflect the nuanced, interdependent costs encountered in real-world scenarios.

The paper proposes multi-objective optimization, allowing the system to balance various objectives without requiring an initial cost matrix. This flexibility lets users prioritize objectives such as reducing false positives, reducing false negatives, and incorporating unique cost functions that account for relationships between data instances.

The research introduces an "anytime" user interaction model. Users can delve into data and ongoing results, facilitating real-time interaction without long processing waits. This differs from active learning, where experts only label data; here, experts can adjust generated rules directly.

A case study in a medium-sized software company demonstrated the application of this rule mining system to identify software changes that did not require review, highlighting the practical benefits of this approach in a domain-specific context.

For this domain, three cost functions were developed: (1) estimating effort spent by experts on predictions, (2) covering unaddressed actions, and (3) understanding the complexity of the rules.

The paper also notes that instances can be interdependent, meaning labels for one instance might relate to othersâ€”a factor not appropriately addressed by single-instance-focused algorithms like RIPPER.

The algorithm introduced operates on a Pareto front, updating solutions continuously through parallel mining threads. It is a modified version of a greedy randomized adaptive search procedure pattern relinking (GRASP-PR) designed to cater for multi-objective optimization.

Instances' relationships are considered by incorporating cost functions that reward coverage of causative actions while avoiding redundant coverage when related actions have already been addressed.

Users can adjust a target function to transform multi-dimensional cost vectors into a single value, for use in hill-climbing and other optimization tactics, thus further aligning the algorithm with user priorities.

The proposed approach (GIMO) was evaluated against existing rule mining algorithms (C4.5 decision trees, RIPPER, and MetaCost+RIPPER) on a real-world dataset involving review remark predictions. While the full details of the study are outside the scope of the paper, GIMO shows promise compared to the other methods, particularly when incorporating interactive feedback from domain experts.

The paper suggests that while GIMO rulesets might be complex, their multi-objective nature enables experts to balance complexity with understandability according to their needs. Additionally, lessons from this research could apply to making opaque models like deep neural networks more interpretable.
