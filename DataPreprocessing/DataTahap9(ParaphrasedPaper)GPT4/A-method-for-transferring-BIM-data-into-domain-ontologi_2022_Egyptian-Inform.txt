The paper discusses how Building Information Modeling (BIM) has transformed the construction industry by facilitating integrated design, collaboration, and asset planning. However, the proprietary file formats used by BIM tools complicate data exchange and reuse. To address this, the paper suggests a method for translating BIM data into the concept sets of specific domains, utilizing semantic web tools to enhance data communication.

Domain ontologies are employed to formally define knowledge fields, aiding information exchange across diverse systems through semantic web technologies. This proposed mapping could enrich information and streamline data integration for semantic tool-based services or the management of facilities and building infrastructures. The paper confirms the method's utility through a case study on airport facility management.

While semantic web technologies are gaining traction to complement BIM in architecture, engineering, construction, and operations (AEC/O) sectors, the absence of standardized information exchange protocols curtails the full utilization of semantic web capabilities in many areas.

The proposed method aims to map BIM data to domain-specific concept sets, making the information more accessible for domain applications and enriching domain ontologies. This process can facilitate data retrieval, exchange, and use in facility management (FM)â€”a discipline focused on the operational phase of buildings and infrastructure, ensuring functionality, safety, comfort, and integration.

An airport facility management case study exemplifies the method, showing potential for operational optimization through the integration of BIM model data into domain-specific management tools.

The paper also delves into the advantages of the OWL file format and converting EXPRESS schemas into OWL ontologies. While general conversion procedures and domain-specific ontologies exist, their complexity hinders direct application, thereby underscoring the need for intermediate mapping mechanisms.

A detailed explanation provides insight into the mapping process, which begins with defining mapping parameters for each domain class and then classifying construction project elements within BIM software. The classified output is transferred to the domain ontology using an exported IFC file.

The method accounts for dynamic changes in infrastructure, allowing managers to update their systems with information from BIM projects regarding maintenance and expansion efforts.

Finally, the paper presents a case study validating the mapping method, implemented using Java and Apache Jena. The study focuses on airport operations and leverages ontologies developed within the EU-funded SESAR project. Source code is available in an open repository, with discussions on the mapping file and the resulting RDF file produced by the case study.
