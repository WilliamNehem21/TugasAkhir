After constructing an execution tree (ET), a debugger employs various search strategies to traverse it, consulting an oracle to verify the correctness of encountered questions. This approach assures the identification of a bug in a malfunctioning program once the oracle addresses all inquiries. However, in cases where multiple bugs are present, only one is detected per debugging session. Eliminating the first bug allows the possibility to reapply algorithmic debugging to discover additional bugs, as demonstrated with an example.

When initiating our research, we selected algorithmic debuggers for our study from a group of thirteen, excluding those deemed too immature for practical use. Our goal was not to pit algorithmic debugging techniques against each other, but to evaluate mature, practical implementations. Each debugger was assessed based on its most recent version, exploring its full capabilities. Additionally, we identified certain attributes desirable in declarative debuggers which are currently not implemented by any.

Several debugging strategies (like divide and query, top-down zooming, and dynamic weighting) aim to minimize both the number of oracle questions and the time spent answering them. This involves strategies that condense the ET and simplify or semantically group questions. Tracing subexpressions offers the dual benefit of narrowing the search scope and enhancing user understanding by concentrating on the defective subexpression.

Allowing programmers to direct the debugging process can align with their hunches about where the bug might lie, alleviating the rigidity of algorithmic debugging. Combining primary and secondary memory use could improve efficiency, allowing exploration of ET nodes in primary memory while storing extensive ETs on secondary memory.

Our study specifically examined debugger performance with different ET configurations, not comparing them with actual programs which would yield identical bug discovery counts for the same ET using the same strategy. Our experiments with ETs of varying shapes and sizes allowed us to evaluate the debuggers' memory efficiency and scalability.

Regarding memory use, two debuggers were examined: HAT-Delta, which writes the argument reduction tree (ART) to a file and only stores the ET implicitly for debugging purposes, and Buddha, which generates the entire ET in primary memory, its usage measured with a shell script for fairness.

Upcoming developments include an integration of an algorithmic debugger named JavADD into the Java Interactive Visualization Environment (JIVE), leveraging the Java platform for ET production.

HAT-Delta, replacing the older HAT-Detect, has introduced new features like tree compression and improved exploration strategies. Certain older HAT-Detect functionalities may be integrated into HAT-Delta in future releases.

By comparing different debuggers, we identified exclusive features of individual tools, such as Mercury's subexpression tracing capability and HAT-Delta's tree compression. Despite limitations, there's a discernible forward momentum in the evolution of algorithmic debuggers, evident from the release dates and added features.

The study focused on objective, verifiable criteria, excluding subjective aspects like usability or installation ease, reserving such assessments for future work.
