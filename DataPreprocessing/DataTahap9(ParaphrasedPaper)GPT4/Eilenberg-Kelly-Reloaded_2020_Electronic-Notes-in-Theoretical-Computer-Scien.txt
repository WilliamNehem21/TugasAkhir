The given text refers to concepts in Category Theory, a branch of mathematics dealing with abstract structures and their relationships. Here's a paraphrased version of the two examples:

Example 3.5: Consider a left-skew closed category, denoted by (C, I, ⊗), along with a monad T on C that exhibits lax closedness. This indicates that T has both left-strength and right-strength, which together form a bi-strength and these two strengths are compatible (they commute). If we follow the construction from Example 2.8, we denote B(T, C) as B(T, C). Given the left-strength of T, it leads to the conclusion that the Kleisli category of the monad T, denoted (Kl(T), I, ⊗(T)), is a left-skew closed category itself. Now, if the original category (C, I, ⊗) has the additional property of being left-normal, ...

Example 4.7: In Example 3.5, we worked with a closed category (C, I, ⊗) and a lax closed monad (T, C) to explore whether the left-skew closed category (Kl(T), I, ⊗(T)), where B(T, C) is defined as in Example 2.8, would also be normal. However, this attempt was unsuccessful.

Keep in mind that this paraphrase attempts to simplify complex mathematical concepts, which may inherently lose some precision or detail. If you're not already familiar with the terminology and concepts of Category Theory, these examples may still seem quite abstract. Category Theory often uses specific structure-preserving functions called "morphisms" and objects, which in many cases are mathematical structures themselves, and "monads" are a particular kind of functor, which is a sort of "morphisms between categories." "Lax closedness," "left-skew closed category," "left-normal," "bi-strength," and "Kleisli category" are all technical terms within the theory.
