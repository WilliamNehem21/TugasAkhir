In the research discussed, the authors note that recursion operators are expected to follow certain rules, which can be derived from the precondition that recursion interacts with a homomorphism relative to the duplication comonad. They express optimism about being able to formally derive these expectations. Additionally, the paper presents the use of diagrammatic reasoning through string diagrams to represent some of the conceptual arguments.

The paper also discusses the concept of partial strategies within the context of game theory, which are unusually defined as total functions (defined for every input) rather than being partially undefined. The authors justify this approach by highlighting that treating partial strategies as partial functions (which are not defined for every input) creates difficulties when performing pullbacksâ€”a mathematical operation involved in the definition of composition. This complication would impede further theoretical developments, such as proving that the pullback of a partial strategy still qualifies as a partial strategy. By defining partial strategies as total maps, they simplify the treatment of neutral events, allowing them to be isolated within the specific games to which they belong, without mixing up different types of undefined situations.
