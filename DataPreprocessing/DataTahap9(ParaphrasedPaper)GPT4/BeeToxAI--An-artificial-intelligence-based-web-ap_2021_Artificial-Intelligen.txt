The paper outlines a methodology to evaluate pesticides' risks to honey bees by considering both direct and indirect exposure scenarios. Honey bees are at risk of pesticide exposure through contaminated food and water, plant surface residues, or direct contact during application on crops. When a pesticide's use suggests a possible exposure to honey bees, acute contact and oral toxicity studies are necessary for its registration.

The paper discusses the development of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models using two machine learning (ML) methods: support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF). The models are designed to predict the severity of the toxicity due to contact and oral exposure. The process involved duplicate removal, leading to 382 contact exposure compounds (112 toxic, 270 non-toxic) and 169 oral exposure compounds (71 toxic, 98 non-toxic) in the dataset. Another set of datasets for regression models had 218 contact exposure compounds and 142 oral exposure compounds. Bayesian optimization was used to fine-tune the hyperparameters of the models.

The performance of the developed QSAR models was evaluated and compared with other studies. It was found that the models could effectively predict toxicity and probability values, which helps in determining the confidence level of the predictions. In addition, the models incorporate an interactive feature which displays the predicted median lethal dose (LD50) and provides a mechanistic interpretation via color-coded maps that visualize the impact of molecular fragments on toxicity.
