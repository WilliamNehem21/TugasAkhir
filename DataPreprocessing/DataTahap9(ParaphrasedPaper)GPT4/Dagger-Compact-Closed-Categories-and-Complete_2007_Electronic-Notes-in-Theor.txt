In Remark 3.5, we have assigned a directional annotation from left to right on every wire and placed a square in the top-left corner on every box. At present, these annotations do not serve any purpose. However, their relevance will be revealed later when we discuss further annotations in the context of the graphical languages used for compact closed categories and dagger symmetric monoidal categories.
