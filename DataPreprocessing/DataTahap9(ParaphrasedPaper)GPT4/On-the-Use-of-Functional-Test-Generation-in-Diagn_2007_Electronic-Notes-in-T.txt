The academic paper discusses two aspects of test generation for detecting faults in digital circuits: combinational test generation and diagnostic test generation for state transition faults.

Combinational test generation is limited to analyzing the combinational logic portion of a circuit. It involves setting specific values to the primary inputs and current state variables of the circuit, and then observing the effects that faults might have on the primary outputs and variables of the next state. For a specific fault 'f', a combinational test 't' is designed to reveal the fault through a single change in the circuit's state.

For diagnostics, the authors introduce a concept called state transition faults (STF) as part of a group or set designated as STT_arg. Each fault within STT_arg, referred to as an STI, represents either a single or multiple state transition faults. The goal of diagnostic test generation is to produce tests that effectively detect the faults specified in STT_arg. These tests can be created using functional test generation methods or by directly generating tests at the gate level to target the transition faults.
