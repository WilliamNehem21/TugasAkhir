The global population is projected to approach 10 billion by 2050, necessitating a 50% increase in agricultural production from 2013 levels. Currently, around 37.7% of the Earth's land surface is dedicated to agriculture. Agriculture plays a vital role in job creation, contributes to national incomes, and is integral to the economic success of both developed and developing nations. It has significantly improved per capita income in rural areas, and therefore, prioritizing agriculture is seen as both logical and appropriate. In countries like India, agriculture makes up 18% of GDP and employs half of the workforce, with agricultural advances promoting rural development and structural economic transformation.

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) simulate the structure and function of the human brain and excel in self-organization and adaptive learning. ANNs have revolutionized traditional methods across various disciplines, including computer science, engineering, and economics. Jha et al. (2019) highlighted the synergy between embedded systems and AI technologies in agriculture, emphasizing precision farming applications through neural networks and machine learning.

AI technologies enhance efficiency across the board and meet the challenges faced by many industries, including agriculture. They address issues such as crop yields, irrigation, and soil sensing, and have led to the creation of agricultural robots. As the global population grows, the agricultural sector faces challenges, but AI offers potential solutions. AI allows for increased productivity with reduced inputs, improved quality, and faster market readiness. By 2020, farmers were expected to use 75 million connected devices; by 2050, an average farm could amass over 4 million data points daily.

Lee et al. (2017) have observed growing interest in autonomous UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) for a variety of applications, such as surveillance and geolocalization. UAVs, with their remote piloting and aerial dexterity, are increasingly popular in various sectors. Panpatte (2018) suggests that AI enables farmers to consolidate data, providing solutions to complex issues and smarter irrigation methods, leading to higher yields. AI will likely automate many agricultural processes by 2050, when two-thirds of the world's population is expected to reside in urban areas.

Ferguson et al. (1991) noted the importance of selecting the right variety and seed quality for maximum plant performance. Emerging technologies aid in selecting optimal crops and hybrid seeds suitable for diverse conditions, minimizing the risk of plant diseases and meeting market demands. Agriculture accounts for 85% of the world's freshwater usage, highlighting the need for more efficient irrigation technologies.

Kumar (2014) reviewed various irrigation methods, aiming for more resource-efficient systems. Technologies like soil fertility meters allow precise soil management and water conservation through drip irrigation. Varatharajalu and Ramprabu (2018) introduced a system using different sensors to monitor soil moisture, temperature, and pressure, aiding in optimal crop growth. They emphasized the relevance of sensors in assessing soil moisture to regulate irrigation effectively.

Before automating weed control, it's crucial to distinguish crop seedlings from weeds. Techniques like morphological analysis and digital imaging, including neural network-based systems, have helped differentiate plants with varying success.

Xue et al. (2016) developed a UAV-based automated flying spraying system. With the precision of modern systems, sprays can be delivered more uniformly, although challenges with droplet size persist. Hydraulic and centrifugal energy sprayers, along with gas energy sprayers, are various methods utilized to distribute spray to target areas effectively.

Reinecke and Prinsloo (2017a, 2017b) examined the advantages and limitations of drones in agriculture, from assisting in early problem detection to spatial crop mapping and accuracy assessment using remote sensing and GIS.

GIS software allows for the visualization of yield data across fields. Techniques for aligning sensor data with actual harvest locations and adjusting for delays in grain flow are critical for accurate yield mapping.
