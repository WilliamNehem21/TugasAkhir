This paper investigates the enhancement of SAT-based unbounded model checking (UMC) by exploring the reuse of interpolants—a powerful technique in model checking. Traditionally, interpolants have been effectively applied to determine a fixed point in the set of reachable states. This research aims to expand the scope of interpolants by demonstrating that under certain conditions, they can be reused at different points in the model checking procedure. The paper introduces conditions under which it is valid to reuse interpolants and proposes an innovative fixed point condition distinct from those currently based on interpolants.

Despite the promising theoretical framework, early experiments with interpolant reuse in industrial contexts do not indicate a performance benefit. This outcome suggests the need for a more sophisticated implementation and careful selection of interpolants for reuse to potentially enhance their utility.

The structure of the paper is as follows: It starts with an overview of SAT solvers and relevant concepts, reviews SAT-based model checking, develops the conditions for reusing learned interpolants, provides an initial summary of practical experience, and concludes with final remarks.

The paper also presents the typical format of bounded model checking (BMC) for safety properties and acknowledges its effectiveness in industrial applications. The possibility of reusing specific interpolants, as set out by the theorems, is seamlessly compatible with the standard interpolant-based UMC process.

In terms of practical implementation, the paper presents a preliminary SAT-based model checking prototype using reduced boolean circuits (RBCs) and the MiniSAT solver. This implementation currently lacks optimized structure sharing among different interpolants, and additional efforts are required to realize the theoretical advantages of interpolant reuse.

In the current implementation, interpolants have not demonstrated the expected improvement perhaps due to the preliminary nature of the system and a non-optimized experimental setup. Identified shortcomings—including the absence of structure sharing and the sole focus on interpolant reuse instead of checking for a fixed point—are areas targeted for future enhancements, which may lead to more favorable outcomes for the reuse of interpolants.
