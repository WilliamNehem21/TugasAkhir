This paper discusses the significant challenge of balancing the need for increased food production with the preservation of ecosystems. Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies are gaining attention as a tool to promote sustainable agriculture. By reviewing various AI-based models in agricultural functions such as crop forecasting, weed control, and resource management, the paper assesses how AI contributes to sustainability goals in agriculture.

The study illustrates how AI is instrumental in addressing problems such as labor shortages, resource optimization, and the creation of sustainable business practices. Rapid technological advancements have led to an increased focus on AI application development in agriculture to boost productivity.

Traditional crop care practices that heavily rely on chemicals often result in high production costs and environmental pollution. The paper references studies where robotic disease detection systems and Machine Learning (ML) techniques are used for precision in disease identification, application of fertilizers, plant growth tracking, and classification. The potential of AI to support disease management while providing a safe and nutritious food supply is also emphasized.

Weed management and fertilizer application are critical for ensuring sufficient, healthy food production. The paper suggests that future AI-based weed control methods could be improved by factoring in additional variables like light and plant density, and by incorporating advanced sampling techniques.

AI's role in conserving natural resources is highlighted, focusing on protecting soil health, water quality, and biodiversity while boosting agricultural productivity with minimal environmental impact. The review notes substantial progress in AI for sustainable agriculture, particularly in conserving natural resources. Advancements in AI-driven irrigation technologies and decision-support tools, integrating weather, soil, and crop data, are essential for achieving sustainable agricultural practices.

Overall, the paper underscores the potential of AI in transforming agriculture to meet global food demands sustainably, while acknowledging existing limitations and considerations for future technology development.
