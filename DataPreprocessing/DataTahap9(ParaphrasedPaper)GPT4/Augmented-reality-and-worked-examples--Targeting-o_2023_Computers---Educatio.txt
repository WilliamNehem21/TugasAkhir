This academic paper discusses the concept of current achievement motivation (CAM) and its relation to an individual's abilities and self-efficacy, which refers to one's belief in their ability to succeed in specific tasks. The paper presents a study that employs two instruments: the Questionnaire on Current Motivation (QCM), an 18-item tool to measure motivation in performance situations using a 7-point Likert scale, and the SEAR Test Instrument, a 9-item assessment for measuring students' understanding of electrophilic aromatic substitution chemistry.

The ethical approval was secured by UEA's ethics committee, ensuring informed consent, anonymity, and confidentiality. To avoid carryover effects, participants engaged in only one worked example activity, and a two-phase (pre- and post-test) study design was adopted, incorporating a teaching session on electrophilic aromatic substitution.

The study utilized principles from cognitive load theory and multimedia learning to design effective learning resources, ensuring they were at the appropriate complexity. It suggests that diagrams may be more effective educational tools than text alone, and stresses the importance of spatial and temporal contiguity with multimedia content.

Statistical tests did not show significant differences in cognitive load between groups of differing prior knowledge. An expertise reversal effect was expected, as learners with more knowledge might find certain learning materials redundant. A moderate effect size was seen in favor of students with less prior knowledge, who showed greater normalized learning improvements.

Reliability was pursued by negotiated agreement between coders, using Krippendorff's alpha, a reliability measure suitable for smaller samples. The study acknowledges limitations, including a small sample size, potential self-selection bias in interview participants, and the lack of delayed post-tests to assess long-term retention.

Worked examples, especially when enhanced with augmented reality (AR) technology, were shown to support learning in complex subjects like electrophilic aromatic substitution. No significant differences were found in measures of cognitive load and achievement motivation between study groups. The QCM data correlated challenge, interest, and probability of success positively with reported germane cognitive load (GCL), and extraneous cognitive load (ECL) negatively correlated with GCL, challenge, and interest. Higher prior chemistry experience strengthened the negative correlation between challenge, interest, and ECL. 

The study's ethical procedures complied with institutional standards, were in accord with informed consent, and ensured no conflicts of interest.
