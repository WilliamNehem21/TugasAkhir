Quantum computers show promise for solving NP-hard problems, but current quantum annealer designs assume a single task occupies the entire machine, leading to inefficiency. This study explores how to enable multitasking on quantum annealers, allowing parallel or concurrent execution of multiple tasks to better utilize resources, akin to classical CPUs or GPUs. No commercial quantum annealers currently support multitasking natively. Drawing on existing models from D-Wave systems, the paper proposes a scheme to package multiple tasks into a single quantum machine instruction (QMI) and introduces task preemption emulation through controlled sampling times.

The research investigates space and time parallelism in quantum annealers and looks at several scheduling algorithms suitable for this new multitasking approach. The concept is tested through simulations, showing that multitasking can significantly boost the potential of quantum annealing, making it more time and resource-efficient. This advance could carry benefits for time-sensitive applications like automation control and autonomous driving and enable quantum annealer virtualization for multi-user sharing.

The paper includes the following structure: a literature review, a definition of the task and processing model, a multitasking model tailored for quantum annealers, a formalized scheduling problem for multitasking, potential challenges and opportunities, a simulation study illustrating multitasking benefits, and a conclusion with a broader outlook on multitasking in quantum computing beyond annealers.

The findings suggest that, though current quantum annealers like D-Wave's models donâ€™t inherently support multitasking due to hardware and design constraints, there is potential for significant improvement in resource efficiency and performance by adapting multitasking capabilities. This could address a multitude of applications and spur new opportunities for using quantum annealers in various computing tasks.
