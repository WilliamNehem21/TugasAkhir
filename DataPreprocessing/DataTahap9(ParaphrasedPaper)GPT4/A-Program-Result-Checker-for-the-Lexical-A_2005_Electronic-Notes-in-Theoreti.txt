The academic paper presents the conceptual framework for using program result checking to ensure the correctness of compiler frontends, specifically supposing the possibility but also highlighting the lack of practical evidence for its effectiveness in real-world compilers. The paper demonstrates that the lexical analysis component of the GNU C Compiler (GCC) can be formally specified and verified within the Isabelle/HOL theorem prover through program checking.

Program checking involves validating that a black box implementation 'p' of a function 'f' produces the correct output for a given input 'x', by comparing 'p(x)' with the expected 'f(x)'. To apply program checking to GCC, the authors recalculate the lexical analysis results using a verified implementation and compare these with the original GCC outputs.

The paper details how to access the tokens and their associated values produced by GCC, describing necessary modifications to the GCC code to facilitate this access. A checking architecture is described where Isabelle/HOL is integrated with GCC to verify the tokens and values.

The pursuit of program checking in compiler construction has been an ongoing effort, as seen in other projects, but often limited in scope to simple programs or particular optimization checks. Prior work has focused on formal verification methods for compiler components like lexical analysis but has not always addressed large-scale, practical compilers.

In contributing to the field, the paper sets up an architecture for result checking of compiler frontend computations, especially lexical analysis, showing that formal specification and program checking can be applied to large, widely-used, non-academic compilers. The authors suggest that their method is generalizable to other compilers and programming languages and propose future work to further integrate their checking architecture with formal proofs for the creation of lexical analyzers from regular grammars, facilitating a completely verified result for lexical analysis.
