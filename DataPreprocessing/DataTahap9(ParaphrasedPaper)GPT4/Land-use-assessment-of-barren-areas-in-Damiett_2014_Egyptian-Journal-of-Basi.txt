Damietta, today a significant Egyptian industrial hub, particularly post the construction of a new container port in the 1980s, is composed of four main administrative subdivisions including Kafr Saad, Faraskour, El-Zarka, and Damietta City, with the latter housing most of its roughly 1.3 million inhabitants. The region experiences a predominantly arid climate with low annual precipitation rates heavily overshadowed by high evapotranspiration (ET), especially in June. Winds are chiefly from the northwest except in winter, when they arrive from the southwest.

Different soils in the area are systematically categorized using the American soil classification system, taking into account various factors. Soil quality assessments, such as the Storie Index, are crucial for understanding and planning land use by rating soils based on profile, texture, slope, and salinity.

To evaluate how land is used and covered, a process integral for planning and environmental modeling, satellite data and aerial images have become standard tools. These technologies have helped create maps at multiple scales, differentiating between features like lakes and forests (land cover) and the activities performed on them (land use). NASA's Landsat satellites have been critical in these efforts since 1972, with Landsat 8 launching in 2013, marked by enhanced resolution capabilities. These satellites enable land classification via both manual and automated methods, the latter grouping pixels into predefined classes.

The objectives of the study at hand include identifying and evaluating barren lands in Damietta for potential usability. Factors influencing soil formation such as parent material, climate, topography, biota, and time have been investigated, resulting in a distinctive soil classification for the region based on a multitude of criteria including geomorphological, chemical, and climatic features.

Soil examinations highlight that the Nile's fluvial deposits are primarily clayey, while coastal Damietta features sandier sediments. Soil quality indicators, like electrical conductivity (EC), pH, and nutrient content including potassium, phosphorus, and nitrogen, vary, pointing to differences in their origins and management, such as the influence of fertilization in agricultural areas.

The maturity of soil is also influenced by biotic factors, but due to arid conditions and sparse vegetation apart from halophytes, biotic influences are limited outside of managed agricultural lands.

The Storie Index is applied by assessing soil profile, texture, slope, and salinity, with ratings from 100 (deep, fine-textured, flat, and low salinity soils) to lower scores for less ideal conditions. Soil classifications reveal predominantly Entisols with suborders reflecting local depositional environments.

The study concludes that areas with high soil salinity, while unsuitable for traditional agriculture, could potentially support treated wastewater in basins for growing swamp vegetation to reduce nutrient levels rather than being repurposed for agriculture, which would require significant desalination efforts.
