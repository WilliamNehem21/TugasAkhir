This scholarly article discusses the urgency of developing effective measures to safeguard critical infrastructures from various threats, emphasizing the challenge of quantifying the impact of attacks. Attack trees have become a popular method to model potential attack scenarios, and though enhancements have been made to their expressive capabilities, there is a need to improve their analyzability. The paper introduces a method that converts attack trees into Bayesian networks, which is accommodating to various attack tree extensions and provides a means to quantitatively assess the likelihood and combined effect of multiple attack scenarios.

The conversion process necessitates expert knowledge of the system under evaluation. Experts traditionally use top-down or bottom-up approaches, such as examining system logs or assessing the risk of exploitation from component interactions. Research is increasingly focused on providing automatic support to experts during the system design, evaluation, and monitoring phases, especially in security-related event correlation.

The paper argues for the benefits of quantitative risk assessment over qualitative or semi-quantitative methods, as quantitative analysis can more effectively measure the risks posed by hostile actions. It allows for better evaluation of protective solutions and facilitates cost-benefit analysis.

The proposed methodology uses Bayesian networks, which enable the combination of separate attack trees into a comprehensive model to assess aggregate effects. Bayesian networks are chosen over other formalisms like Petri nets because they offer advantages like multi-valued nodes and efficient combinatorial analysis algorithms. The focus on model-to-model transformations allows for the generation of more analyzable models and the use of various formalisms, potentially enhancing solver capability.

The article also touches on the origins of attack trees, their flexible application in fields beyond computer security, and the differences between attack trees and fault trees. The methodology is demonstrated with an example of potential attacks on railway infrastructure, highlighting vulnerabilities like port security breaches and unauthorized database access, and the implications of organized attacks on transportation schedules.

In conclusion, the paper presents a tool that automatically converts multiple attack trees into a Bayesian network model, allowing for the quantitative evaluation of complex and interrelated attack scenarios, such as those targeting railway systems. The case study showcased in the paper includes modeling attacks on trains, railway facilities, and hazardous material transportation, analyzed using the translated Bayesian network.
