The paper discusses the JSynopsys tool, which applies scenario-based testing techniques to B machines. These scenarios are described as regular expressions over system operations, which are associated with specific intermediate states that must be achieved. JSynopsys uses the BZ-Testing-Tools engine, originally intended for symbolic animation and boundary test generation from B machines, and advances the concept by abstracting operation parameter values until a scenario is fully executed, at which point values are realized through constraint-solving methods.

In traditional model-based testing, a formal model represents a system's behavior to create test cases and an oracle, which is used to determine if the system's behavior aligns with the model. This can differ depending on model structure: for instance, finite state machine models (FSMs) often employ state exploration or transition coverage algorithms like the Chinese postman algorithm. The paper describes a constraint solver for animating the model, which is part of the BZ-Testing-Tools (BZ-TT) framework, thus enabling an efficient generation of test cases through native backtracking. This method has been effective in realistic scenarios such as modeling a POSIX-compliant file system, and is now implemented in JSynopsys, which combines a graphical interface and a Prolog constraint solver.

The paper also covers the lifecycle of smart card applications like DeMony. These consist of personalization, use, and possibly a blocked state due to security violations, which require authentication and resetting procedures via specific commands. Moreover, the paper explains the principle of symbolic animation, where B model operations are decomposed into behaviors, each with an activation condition and substitutions. The selection of behaviors is automated, and possible combinations are explored using backtracking.

JSynopsys and BZ-Testing-Tools depend on the CLPS-BZ constraint solver compatible with various B machine data structures. Since the AC3 arc consistency algorithm cannot guarantee immediate inconsistency detection, a labeling phase is essential for ensuring constraint system consistency. Labeling might be done upon reaching a state, or at the end of unfolding to assign parameter values.

Lastly, the paper compares JSynopsys' approach to related work in reactive systems testing, where an Attributed Event Grammar (AEG) is analogous to regular expressions used in scenario-based testing. The concept of test purposes in various tools also relates to scenarios, particularly when an automata product restricts system executions to match these test purposes, which has been adapted to B machines in other studies.
