The discussed academic paper distinguishes between assertions and built-in tests, asserting that the latter must incorporate test cases as part of the component structure to effectively validate software functionality. Built-in testing strategies, particularly built-in self-tests, are explained as autonomous software modules furnished with their own tests for inspecting their implementation.

The paper recognizes the need for an advancement in model-based design, specification, and execution of built-in tests, especially within the framework of Model-Driven Architectures (MDA). It highlights the creation of Unified Modeling Language (UML) version 2.0 and the UML 2.0 Testing Profile as technological foundations for such advancement. The discussion moves to the principles of built-in tests, their model-based generation, specification, and execution, and culminates with a practical application example.

A test is elaborated as the method execution of a component with specific input and validation of output against expected results, with considerations for state-transition correctness under object-oriented paradigms. The study also touches on encapsulation and information hiding within components, explaining how external test software typically can't access internal state information, and how traditional approaches to component testing have therefore become limited.

The paper argues that employing UML in model-based development and testing benefits projects by maintaining consistency across varying levels of system detail, avoiding the need to switch between different notational forms. This simplifies system representation and ensures cohesive system overviews, from high-level abstracts to detailed source code level representations.

The concept of coverage in software testing is reintroduced, emphasizing its importance as a tool for identifying faults by ensuring that relevant code sections are executed during tests. The paper critiques traditional separation of unit and integration testing, advocating for a more nuanced approach that accommodates both white-box and black-box knowledge in component-based developments.

The UML Testing Profile is explained as an extension for visualizing and defining artifacts in a test system using UML concepts. It introduces tailored concepts for test architecture, behavior, and data, including support for arbitration, test behaviors, wildcard specifications, and handling of unexpected events or data in test models.

Finally, the paper presents an example of model-based built-in tests through the "RIN System" case study, showcasing the relevant steps and components involved. It demonstrates how built-in test components can validate the functionality of a server within the system by registering a valid client, employing default handlers for unforeseen server responses, and verifying post-registration states, thus concluding with a pass or fail verdict based on the outcome.
