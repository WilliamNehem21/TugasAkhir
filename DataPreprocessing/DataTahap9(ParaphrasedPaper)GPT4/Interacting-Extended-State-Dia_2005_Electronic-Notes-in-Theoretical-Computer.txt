The research paper discusses the application of integrated formal description techniques for the specification of multi-faceted systems. A formalism called Extended State Diagrams (ESD) is proposed, which unifies state diagrams with formal data description languages within a consistent framework. The paper focuses on enhancing the ESD's implicit communication mechanisms through the introduction of explicit communication descriptions using synchronization vectors. The potential use of interaction diagrams as a complementary approach is also examined.

The necessity for describing systems with increasing complexity from multiple perspectives has become apparent in both programming and system specification/design fields. To address this, the researchers have developed an integrated formalism based on their past experiments to enable the specification of these complex systems.

To better facilitate interactions between ESDs, this paper extends the initial proposal by introducing synchronization vectors as an alternative communication mechanism, continuing to maintain the formal integrity of the entire system. The use of interaction diagrams is also recommended due to their simplicity and direct integration with ESD semantics. This approach allows for straightforward specification of interactions without the need for additional formalism.

The semantics of the formalism are not aimed at a specific state diagram dialect. Instead, the researchers focus on formalizing the integration of state diagrams with formal data types, thus extending their applicability. Assuming the operational semantics are provided by labelled transition systems (LTS), the paper details a set of semantic rules divided into groups. These rules help in type-checking, interpreting terms through evaluation mechanisms, and extending the basic semantics to reflect the individual evolutions of extended diagrams. The extension accommodates variable bindings, input and output event queues, and accounts for value receptions and actions.

The explicit approach to communication in integrated specifications leads to an increased level of reusability, as there is no communication-specific information embedded within the sequential components. The proposed synchronization vectors offer a way to define various synchronization policies, while interaction diagrams, although less expressive, provide a user-friendly graphical representation.

In summary, the paper advocates for explicit communication mechanisms within the context of integrated system specifications to better manage complex, multi-aspect systems.
