This academic paper discusses a programming language that allows procedures to be saved in state variables and to be used as arguments. It also demonstrates that the language can be extended to support adjoint simulations. However, the integration of procedures with global variables and parameters makes the relationship with exponents somewhat less straightforward. The paper doesn't emphasize categorical concepts. The explicit link between this language and lambda calculus was established in subsequent research.
