The paper addresses the challenge of recognizing human actions in complex environments, particularly when using overhead cameras that often encounter occlusion issues. While overhead cameras help in reducing occlusions, they introduce new issues, such as misidentifying rotated behaviors. To solve this, the paper introduces a method using Hu moments, which are invariant to rotation, to represent human postures. This technique is coupled with Support Vector Machines (SVM) for both training and classification purposes.

Dynamic behaviors are captured by observing the changes in the centroid of the binary image representing a person. The paper highlights the advantage of using the top-view approach in action recognition and contrasts it with the more common side or angle view techniques that focus on crowd counting and less on understanding actions.

The authors employ moments that are invariant to geometric transformations, like rotation, to capture the shape of human figures from above and train an SVM classifier to recognize these features. The method aims not only to identify static postures but also to extract more complex dynamic behavioral information.

Experiments were carried out with a camera positioned at the ceiling, and the results are promising, showing that the method can accurately recognize both static postures and complex dynamic actions. The findings indicate a higher recognition rate compared to previous studies. However, challenges such as identifying specific arm movements remain and are suggested as a direction for future research. This paper lays the groundwork for further investigation into action recognition, interaction, and tracking from a top-view perspective.
