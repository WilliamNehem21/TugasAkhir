In a study of genetic associations with 36 human quantitative traits, Chen, Chen, Feng, Yu, Lin, and colleagues analyzed data from 102,900 participants in the Taiwan Biobank. They identified 1,986 significant genetic locations and, through comparative analyses with data from the Biobank Japan (BBJ) and UK Biobank (UKBB), as well as previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS), they discovered 968 novel genetic loci. The team also explored the effectiveness of using polygenic risk scores (PRS) that combined information across different traits and populations to predict disease risk, emphasizing the value of genetic studies in diverse populations.

The genetic architecture for the traits under investigation was largely consistent within East Asian populations and between East Asian and European populations. By integrating GWAS findings from Taiwan Biobank and BBJ, the researchers pinpointed 3,825 genetic loci, with 968 being previously unreported in GWAS. They fine-mapped over 200 associations to a single variant and found 24 possible causative missense variants in new genes associated with these traits. The PRS analysis indicated that disease risk prediction could be improved using GWAS biomarker data from diverse populations.

The researchers employed summary statistics from TWB, BBJ, UKBB, and international consortia to develop disease risk prediction models that use polygenic scoring methods. A particular methodology, PRScsx, was used for integrating biomarker GWAS from various populations. The optimal weights for a combined PRS were then determined through a strategy of validation and testing. This approach highlighted the benefit of incorporating multiple biomarker PRS derived from GWAS across different populations in enhancing the predictive power for disease risk.

Notably, the study focused on a select set of traits and diseases due to data availability, suggesting that expanding the range of phenotypes considered could be beneficial for further research. The combined sample size from TWB and BBJ was still relatively small in comparison to studies in European populations, thus future work on increasing sample size and phenotypic diversity, as well as improving data harmonization, could lead to additional genetic discoveries.

The project received support from various foundations and research centers, and acknowledgment was given for the contributions of Taiwan's national facilities that provided computational and storage resources. Approval for data access and usage was obtained from the appropriate ethical review boards in Taiwan, and the research was conducted with informed consent from all TWB participants. Genetic data from BBJ and UKBB was sourced from publicly available summary statistics.

The genetic data was subjected to quality control and imputation using reference panels from the 1000 Genomes Project Phase 3. The researchers performed their analysis on a subset of the samples after these quality control measures. They also took into account the self-reported paternal and maternal origins of the participants, only comparing PRS distributions among those with consistent parental origin.
