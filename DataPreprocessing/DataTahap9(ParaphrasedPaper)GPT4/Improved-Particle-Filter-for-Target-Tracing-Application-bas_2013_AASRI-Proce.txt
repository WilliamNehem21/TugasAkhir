The academic paper discusses the challenge of tracking maneuvering targets, noting that while most tracking algorithms use linear filters, these result in greater estimation errors when applied to maneuvering targets. To address this, researchers are focusing on algorithms suitable for maneuvering target tracking. The paper introduces an enhanced particle filter designed for this purpose, acknowledging that while effective, traditional particle filters require significant computational resources to process the complex tracking of maneuvering targets.

The paper then discusses the application of grid technology, which leverages distributed computing to handle intensive calculations, as a means to overcome the computational limitations associated with particle filters. Specifically, the paper presents a framework using the ChinaGrid system to accelerate the particle filter computations needed for maneuvering target tracking.

The authors demonstrate that their proposed framework significantly improves the performance of maneuvering target tracking by distributing the computational load across the grid network. They showcase the effectiveness of this approach through simulations, indicating that the improved particle filter, when supported by the ChinaGrid, can efficiently handle the complexities of maneuvering target tracking, offering a valuable tool for real-world tracking systems.
