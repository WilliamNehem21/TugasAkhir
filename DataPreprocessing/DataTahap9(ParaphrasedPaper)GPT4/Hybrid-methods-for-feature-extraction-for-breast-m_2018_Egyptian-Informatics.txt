The paper concentrates on extracting characteristic features for identifying malignant tumors in mammography images and categorizing them. It introduces seven new texture features based on the Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) approach, optimized for sub-image evaluations to enhance effectiveness. Additionally, the paper proposes three innovative hybrid methods—Wavelet-CT1, Wavelet-CT2, and ST-GLCM— which integrate different types of features for improved detection.

These feature extraction methods aim to support Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems, which can help radiologists by providing a second opinion and improving sensitivity in diagnosing breast cancer. By using CAD, the confidence level in breast cancer screening outcomes can be increased.

For evaluation purposes, the researchers used two widely recognized mammogram databases: the Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM) and Mammographic Image Analysis Society (MIAS) database from the PEIPA archive at the University of Essex. The developed methods, utilizing MATLAB, were tested against these databases, which include a mix of normal and malignant mammogram images.

The paper compares the proposed methods, which also utilize multi-resolution features derived from discrete wavelet, ridgelet, and curvelet transforms on Regions of Interest (ROI) sub-images. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel, whose parameters were carefully tuned, was employed to categorize the ROIs into malignant or non-malignant cases.

The research suggests dividing ROIs into sub-images to improve performance, detailing two options to reduce feature value counts and thus lighten the classifier's load. Results indicate that Option 2, which calculates on sums of GLCM pairs, maintains accuracy while halving feature count.

To evaluate the feature extraction methods, the paper considers accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity as crucial parameters, with sensitivity being the rate of correctly identifying cancer, and specificity being the rate of correctly identifying normal tissue.

An additional measure of performance discussed is the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC), which is favored by medical and biological researchers as a superior statistical gauge. The paper discusses SVM classification accuracy in relation to optimal kernel function selection, highlighting the preference for the RBF kernel because it poses fewer numerical challenges.

Performance tests with 2-fold cross-validation for the MIAS and DDSM databases indicated that Wavelet-CT1 and ST-GLCM methods achieved the highest AUC, with Wavelet-CT2 and Contourlet-CT2 showing very close accuracy and sensitivity on sub-images. Particularly, the ridgelet features offered high sensitivity but resulted in a large number of features, which could be seen as a downside.

In summary, this research provides new methods for more accurately extracting features and, when combined with SVM classification, has the potential to greatly influence the reliability of CAD systems in the diagnosis of breast cancer.
