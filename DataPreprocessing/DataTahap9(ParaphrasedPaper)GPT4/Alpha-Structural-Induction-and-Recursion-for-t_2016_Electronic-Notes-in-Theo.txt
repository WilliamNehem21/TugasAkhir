Inductive types, typically defined by listing their constructors, can also incorporate parameters from other types. This characteristic allows for the creation of type families, which are dependent on another base type.

This feature is what allows type theory to be viewed as a form of constructive logic. This interpretation is realized by modeling propositions using inductive types, with the constructors of these types serving as the rules for introducing or proving the propositions.
