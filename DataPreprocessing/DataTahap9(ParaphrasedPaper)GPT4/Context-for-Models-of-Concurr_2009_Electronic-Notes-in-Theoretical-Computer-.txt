Researchers are using a variety of topological models, such as precubical complexes, d-spaces, local partially ordered (po-)spaces, and flows to investigate properties of systems that involve concurrency. Each model provides a unique perspective for examining essential characteristics of concurrent systems in computer science.

Efforts have been made to simplify the analysis of concurrent systems locally by using directed homotopies and the concept of the fundamental category, while on the global scale, methods such as the component category have been developed. This paper proposes a new global method that offers a more geometric perspective and aligns with the model categorical approach.

The paper outlines that the category of po-spaces allows for all small limits and colimits, which are essential structures in category theory. Yet, it notes that po-spaces are very restrictive and cannot represent certain aspects of concurrent systems, such as loops. Instead, the paper suggests the category of local po-spaces (lopospc) as a more suitable framework due to the compatibility of local orders within each neighborhood of a topological space.

Although lopospc lacks the ability to include all small colimits, a procedural way to expand a category to include both small limits and colimits was stated. This extended category would also possess a model structure. For an in-depth application to lopospc, the paper refers readers to the appendix.

The paper then provides an example involving the manipulation of topological spaces. Spaces A, B, C, B', and C' are used in a manner similar to a previous example, but with the marked points on B and B' located on their top edges and those on C and C' found on their bottom edges. D' is described as a new space created by joining the bottom edge of C to the top edge of B, illustrating a specific instance of combining these spaces.
