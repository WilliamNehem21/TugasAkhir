This paper analyzes a specific decision problem concerning the admissibility of graphs with respect to particular parameters; it primarily examines graphs classified as (0, 2) and (1, 1), which are known to be 3-admissible. Table 2 outlines the authors' main findings concerning the admissibility of graphs with parameters defined by functions msst(k, l). While most cases are established as NP-complete, the paper also identifies certain subclasses of graphs where the msst problem is solvable.

In the research, they focus on characterizing 2-admissible graphs within the (0, 2) category. They define a subgraph H as a subset of a graph G, where H consists of vertices connected by transversal edges, which link distinct partitions of the graph.

The study discusses the structure of chordal graphs, highlighting that a (2, 0)-graph is a chordal graph if and only if it does not contain any cycles, essentially making it a forest. They extend this concept to examine (2, 1)-chordal graphs, which can be divided into a forest F and a clique K. In any given graph G, transversal edges are defined as the edges connected to vertices from both F and K.

Such transversal edges can lead to the formation of cycles in G, identified as either type 1 or type 2 cycles based on the arrangement of the connected vertices. They discuss the characteristics and conditions necessary for both types of cycles in chordal graphs, laying out how vertices in the clique K interact with the rest of the cycle.

Lastly, the paper describes the concept of a bi-star B, created by joining a leaf of one star graph to the center of a second star graph. A bi-star with centers labeled v and w is referred to as a v, w-centered bi-star. They specify the leaf sets associated with each of these centers in B as l(v) and l(w).

In sum, the paper offers a detailed examination of certain graph theory problems relating to the admissibility of graphs based on particular structures and properties, contributing to the field with insights and classifications of certain graph types as NP-complete while also indicating tractable subclasses of these problems.
