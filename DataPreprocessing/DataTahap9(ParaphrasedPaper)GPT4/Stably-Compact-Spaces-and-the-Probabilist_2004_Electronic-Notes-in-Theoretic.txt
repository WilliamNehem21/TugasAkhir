In the academic paper, a proof is provided that involves the concept of topological spaces and compactness within them. The paper explains that when dealing with the intersection of a collection of compact saturated subsets, one can simplify the situation by considering only a filtered collection. Thanks to the property of well-filteredness, any open cover of this intersection must have at least one element from the filter base. Since this element is compact, there is no need for an infinite cover, and instead, a finite subset of the open cover can be chosen that is sufficient to cover the compact element in question.
