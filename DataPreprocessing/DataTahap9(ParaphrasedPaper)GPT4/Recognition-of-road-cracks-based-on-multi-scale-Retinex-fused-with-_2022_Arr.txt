This academic paper addresses the challenge of automatically detecting road cracks, which are a major concern for road safety and infrastructure maintenance. Although crucial, the performance of existing automatic crack detection systems is often inadequate due to factors like uneven lighting, low contrast between cracks and pavement, and the encounter of shadows that mask the true nature of cracks.

To address these issues, the paper introduces a modified multi-scale Retinex algorithm, which is enhanced by integrating wavelet transform to mitigate the halo effect typically caused by the Retinex algorithm, thus reducing image distortion. The Retinex component compensates for the loss of valuable information that might occur with wavelet transforms alone. This hybrid approach leads to a more effective crack enhancement in images.

The paper also discusses preprocessing steps to remove shadows before enhancing crack images, effectively reducing false positives caused by intense shadows. Experimental results show that this new algorithm significantly improves the visibility of cracks.

The paper also reviews other common methods of pavement crack detection, which include image feature-based techniques and machine learning-based approaches. While image feature-based methods (such as edge detection and histogram analysis) are more common in engineering applications, they often require manual threshold settings and are sensitive to the threshold and structural elements chosen.

The authors further explain that pavement images are frequently captured under poor weather and lighting conditions, making standard threshold-based segmentation approaches ineffective. This is due to the variability in the gray values of cracks, which may even be higher than the pavement under uneven illumination.

Finally, the paper highlights the issue of shadows in images, which can be confused with crack patterns. By proposing different shadow removal methods tailored to the specific characteristics of shadows, the paper addresses this challenge in detail.

In conclusion, the proposed algorithm, which combines improved multi-scale Retinex processing with wavelet transforms and shadow removal, has been shown to significantly boost the accuracy of crack detection systems, achieving a high recognition accuracy, and suggesting the approach has substantial value for both research and practical engineering applications.
