The Multi-Objective Immune System Algorithm (MISA) is recognized as an inaugural framework in multi-objective artificial immune system research. Initially, the algorithm was closely aligned with the clonal selection principle but evolved to prioritize performance over strictly adhering to the biological metaphor. Solutions are represented as binary strings within a randomly generated initial population. Instead of a scalar index, a set of rules is implemented for selecting antibodies for cloning. Ranking is determined by prioritizing feasible and nondominated individuals, then infeasible but nondominated individuals, and lastly, infeasible and dominated individuals. The memory set or secondary population is maintained with nondominated, feasible solutions and uses an adaptive grid to maintain a diverse sample of nondominated solutions due to limited repository size.

For solving multi-objective nonlinear programming problems (MONP), a general methodology transforms the understanding of Pareto-optimal solutions into a concept analogous to solving nonlinear programming problems (NLPPs) through techniques such as weighted aggregation. By varying the weighting vectors, the aim is to identify a collection of Pareto-optimal front points, though this method can falter if there is difficulty in selecting appropriate weightings or if the solution space is non-convex, which could omit some Pareto-optimal solutions. To avoid these issues, the study focuses on convex multi-objective problems.

The MISA approach uses an affinity measure, determined by nondominance and feasibility, to regulate mutation in the antibodies. When combined with the secondary population, this measure supports more accurate and efficient identification of Pareto-optimal solutions by ensuring a uniform distribution of nondominated solutions. The methodology is competitive with, or superior to, other evolutionary algorithms, particularly after initializing the population with feasible antibodies sourced from extremity values determined by neural networks.
