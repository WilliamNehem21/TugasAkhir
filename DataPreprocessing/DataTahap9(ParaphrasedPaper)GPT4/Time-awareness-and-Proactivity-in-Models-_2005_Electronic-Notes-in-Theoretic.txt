The paper discusses "kinetic engineering," a term coined by J. Ferber in distributed artificial intelligence research, signifying the creation of artificial systems with interacting autonomous and proactive components. This concept is related to genetic engineering in biological systems and highlights the similarities between the construction principles of artificial and biological systems. Multi-agent systems embody behavioral characteristics that extend beyond what conventional algorithmic computing offers and are essential in real-time, autonomous, and proactive systems.

Ubiquitous computing builds upon real-time systems and plug-and-play technologies, giving rise to new notions linked to autonomic and proactive computing. Proactive systems consist of independent components, some with their own time-counting mechanisms. Proactive elements include perceptive subcomponents that work alongside goal-processing subunits. When these components form coalitions, the complexity increases, which requires further detailed discussion in future publications.

H.A. Simon highlighted the importance of computing across different environments relating closely to cand o-machines, which facilitate interactions between a computing machine and entities in varied settings. Since the 1990s, interactive computing has seen increasing interest, driving the evolution of practical computing and the perception of computation itself. This progression has inspired the development of theories and models of interactive computation, challenging the traditional confines of the Church-Turing algorithm theory. Some researchers propose a radical generalization of computability, like computability logic describing computation as a game against the environment, while others advocate systematic approaches leading to non-trivial generalizations of the Church-Turing thesis.

The paper proposes a generic taxonomy incorporated within models of computation to compare different methods, aiming for a time-aware model of interactive computing. This taxonomy implicitly includes various previous publications, but the development of a detailed taxonomy for specific methods is not its objective.

The authors introduce a category for models and systems that encompasses both topological and metric time—the latter being a synchronized counter of periodic ticks linked to human-measured astronomical time. Such systems may utilize time in various ways, such as reversible or relative, with the help of timers based on this metric.

The paper underlines that software-intensive systems, capable of direct interaction with their environment and exhibiting autonomous and proactive behavior, necessitate distinct analysis methods not covered by traditional computer science. These systems demand a new time-aware model of interactive computation.

In summary, in systems with autonomous and proactive components, each may have its own time system, and a single additional dimension of time does not address the issue of time-awareness. The paper argues for a formal timing analysis using multiple metric times and three time concepts—strictly increasing, fully reversible, and relative with a moving origin, which has not been widely applied in computer science.
