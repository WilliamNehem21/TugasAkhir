Paraphrased Background/Introduction:

The study of sentiment analysis at the concept level focuses on identifying and categorizing ideas and attributes that are mentioned in online user feedback about various items, including commercial products and public figures such as politicians and government measures. Previous research on concept-level sentiment analysis has been limited by the use of a narrow range of linguistic rules for extracting concepts and their corresponding attributes. Moreover, the ontological relationships utilized in earlier attempts at concept-level sentiment analysis could benefit from refinement, with an expansion of the concepts, attributes, and ontological connections considered.

Sentiment analysis (SA) that leverages ontological relationships in online reviews presents a considerable challenge because of the diverse nature of ontological concepts and relationships. Existing research on concept-level SA that utilizes ontological connections has worked with a restricted assortment of concepts, attributes, and their ontological relationships to effectively categorize emotions in user feedback. Therefore, it is critical to develop a system for concept-level SA that addresses the shortcomings of previous studies, allowing for the effective classification of user reviews based on different aspects of products.

This research proposes a system for concept-level sentiment analysis that incorporates a broader range of concepts, attributes, and improved ontological relationships to effectively classify user opinions. The system is capable of accurately categorizing user reviews with respect to the specifics of products.

Twitter serves as a platform for users to share their thoughts and feelings about any number of topics, ranging from products and events to organizations. Some studies have examined the task of context-aware sentiment analysis using Twitter data. For instance, Ruba and Venkateson introduced a tailored sentiment analysis tool based on Twitter posts. The method described in this paper involves a three-step process: (i) the creation of domain ontology, 

Kontopoulos and colleagues investigated the ConExp software tool for developing a concept lattice, and this research utilized a similar approach to produce a concept lattice diagram for the mobile phone domain. Various software tools could be employed for formal concept analysis (FCA), such as Lattice Miner, FCART, Concept Explorer, GALICIA, ToscanaJ, among others.

Two models, M1 (Support Vector Machine, SVM) and M2 (Multinomial Naive Bayes, MNB), were selected for evaluation on the dataset. Let 'n' represent the number of records. The error rate for the SVM is denoted by e1, while e2 signifies the error rate for MNB. A key goal was to confirm whether the difference between e1 and e2 is statistically significant. This significance was assessed using established statistical analysis techniques (FCA). Finally, the SVM classifier was applied to perform sentiment analysis at the concept level. The performance of the proposed system was gauged by several metrics and compared with existing state-of-the-art methods. The experimental outcomes were promising, showing improved accuracy (87.5%), precision (88%), recall (88%), and F-score (88%).
