The paper presents a method for automatically rebuilding 3D objects from their drawn views. The method employs a boundary representation (B-Rep) for the 3D models and follows several steps, including: segregating the drawing into different views, calculating vertex coordinates in three dimensions, identifying and marking the basic wireframe components, and reconstructing the object's faces and elements. Central to the approach is the identification of a model's structural features using pre-defined patterns represented in matrix form. The recognition process uses invariants, such as the number of vertices and the types of edges.

The research identified that existing methods mostly cater to simple geometric objects, rather than complex structures like polygonal surfaces, fillets, slots, or holes. The proposed algorithm overcomes these limitations by recognizing complex elements using predetermined templates.

The algorithm starts by dividing the drawing into its respective views (front, top, and left) by examining the positioning of the drawing features against horizontal and vertical lines. For instance, the separation process for the main view and the left view is deemed complete when a specific criterion is met.

Later in the process, model faces are constructed based on closed loops of primitives that lie within the same plane, aiming to minimize the number of primitives in each loop.

Lastly, the algorithm identifies and constructs the model's structural elements using patterns. It determines typical elements by considering the adjacency of 3D primitives, such as straight line segments, circles, and arcs, which are derived from the drawing. Primitives sharing a common vertex are treated as connected.

This novel approach enables the reconstruction of complex geometrical features on 3D objects, expanding the potential of automatic object reconstruction from drawings.
