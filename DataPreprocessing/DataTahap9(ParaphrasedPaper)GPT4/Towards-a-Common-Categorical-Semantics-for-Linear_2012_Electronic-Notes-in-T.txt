In Section 3, the authors reveal how the concept of trueness over time from temporal logic compares to the time-sensitive type inhabitation in functional reactive programming (FRP). They do so by relating the temporal operators to FRP's foundational concepts: behaviors and events, through categorical semantics.

Section 5 discusses future-focused variations of temporal modalities. The authors establish ideal intuitionistic S4 categories to capture these semantics and demonstrate how fan categories may be extended to these ideal intuitionistic S4 categories, paralleling results from Section 4.

Behaviors and events are integral to FRP, representing values changing over time and specific moments when values are assigned, respectively. The modalities "necessarily" (2) and "possibly" (3) in temporal logic are linked to respective type constructors for behaviors and events within FRP, expressed through specific endofunctors.

The authors note that there's an assumed connection between intuitionistic logics and categorical models, akin to classical logics and their corresponding Kripke models. Indeed, this paper confirms such connections.

Ideal intuitionistic S4 categories arise from fan categories, illustrating a relationship that's elaborated upon by comparing these findings to other works, such as Jeffrey's FRP implementation in Agda and related category theories.

Section 4 bridges intuitionistic S4 categories with other categorical models while also hinting at the relationship these have with algebraic and Kripke models.

Fan categories, a central concept introduced in this paper, are proposed as models for a variant of intuitionistic temporal logic (LTL) and a particular type of FRP. They directly model the concept of time-dependent validity in LTL and time-dependent type inhabitance in FRP. By establishing more abstract temporal categories, the paper positions fan categories as a specific instance of these more general structures.

For future work, the authors plan to refine temporal categories to envelop additional modalities from LTL and their equivalents in FRP. They also aim to explore the integration of recursion into these categorical models, apply temporal category concepts in FRP design and implementation, and examine the fusion of temporal logic with other logics for new programming paradigms. Investigating how these findings relate to other categorical FRP semantics is another anticipated area of research.
