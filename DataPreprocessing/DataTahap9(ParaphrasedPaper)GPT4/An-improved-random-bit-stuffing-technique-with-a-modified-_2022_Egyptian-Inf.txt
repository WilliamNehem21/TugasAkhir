The paper discusses the importance of data and network security in light of advancements in networking and the internet, highlighting the crucial role of cryptography as a tool for ensuring security. The study focuses on enhancing the RSA encryption algorithm by introducing a mechanism for random bit insertion, improving the cryptosystem's security and resilience to attacks without increasing the key length from 1024 bits.

The traditional RSA algorithm's security has been challenged by advancements in computing and hacking techniques, necessitating improvements beyond just enlarging the key size. The proposed modified RSA algorithm (RBMRSA) aims to complicate the ciphertext structure, making it difficult for attackers to decrypt the data even if they obtain the secret key, thus providing enhanced reliability and efficiency.

The paper compares the security of the RBMRSRA with the classical 1024-bit RSA using mathematical proofs and experimental results. Performance metrics such as the avalanche effect, which measures the sensitivity of the encryption to small changes in plaintext, and computational complexity are used for the comparison.

Additional cryptographic enhancements are reviewed, including schemes using multiple prime numbers to resist brute force attacks and parallel techniques to speed up RSA operations, although some of these may not fully address security concerns.

RBMRSRA demonstrates a higher level of security than classical RSA, indicated by a significantly higher avalanche effect, but this comes at the cost of increased execution time, highlighting the trade-off between security and performance.

Overall, the paper introduces a novel enhancement to the RSA algorithm that significantly increases its security without requiring larger keys, making it an important contribution to the field of cryptographic research. The study's results, verified through mathematical evaluations and experimental tests, confirm the practical viability of the proposed encryption method.
