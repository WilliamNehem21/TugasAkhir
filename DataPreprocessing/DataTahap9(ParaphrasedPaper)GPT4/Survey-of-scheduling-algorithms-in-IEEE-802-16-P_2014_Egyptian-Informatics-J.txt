This academic paper analyzes the evolution of communication systems, with particular focus on the rise of high speed wireless internet, voice, and multimedia application demands brought about by the rapid development of wireless and mobile networks. Technologies that have gained popularity due to these demands include 3GPP, LTE, 3GPP2, and IEEE 802.16, all of which provide broadband speeds to wireless users.

The paper is structured into various sections. After the introduction, it explores quality of service in WiMAX, reviews related literature, and categorizes studies to help readers understand the scheduling challenges from different perspectives. The paper offers an analysis, conclusions, and suggestions for future research. However, the authors acknowledge that this review is not exhaustive.

In discussing WiMAX operation modes, the paper focuses on Point-to-Multipoint (PMP) mode, examining different scheduling approaches, which are classified into subcategories. For example, the Deficit Round Robin (DRR) scheduler associates each flow with a fixed quantum and deficit counter, providing fairness for variable-length packets, although it struggles with uplink traffic.

The paper references a three-tier scheduling framework by Maode Ma et al., which permits imbalances between downlink and uplink loads. Another highlighted approach is a cross-layer mechanism that consults with the application layer, improving quality of service and system capacity despite increasing complexity at base stations.

Scheduling strategies that regard the problem as an optimization challenge, such as neural networks, genetic algorithms, and game theory, are also discussed. These soft computing techniques have been successfully applied to optimize resource allocation. Notably, neuro-fuzzy methods have been used in a two-stage scheduling process that allocates bandwidth based on queue size and then employs a multi-layer neural network for scheduling execution.

The paper notes a shortage of research on how different routing schemes affect scheduling algorithms and touches on the unexplored topic of incorporating pricing into scheduling to optimize revenue and resource use, an important consideration for commercial implementations.

Scheduling in WiMAX is recognized as a complex, NP-hard problem that may benefit from soft computing techniques to forecast and manage traffic patterns. The paper concludes by asserting that even though many methods have been investigated, there is still substantial room for improvement, especially with the integration of soft computing/optimization techniques and the inclusion of higher-layer information. Future research might also consider the unsolved issue of pricing, especially as WiMAX technology continues to spread in developing countries. Overall, effective scheduling and bandwidth allocation are deemed crucial for supporting quality of service and enhancing WiMAX performance.
