The subsequent sections of the document are organized as follows: Section 2 provides a comprehensive analysis of the Circuit Switched FallBack (CSFB) approach, including its strengths, weaknesses, practical deployment, and the call situations that significantly affect the quality of users' experiences. Section 3 proposes an intelligent strategy for implementing the CSFB procedure and suggests modifications to the calling process to address the issue of delayed call setup times in the most affected instances. Section 4 offers the results of our empirical tests. The paper culminates with a conclusion in Section 5.

The paper addresses the dilemma faced by network operators deciding whether to integrate voice services into their LTE networks that currently lack this capability. Operators can either wait for the availability of handsets that support Single Radio Voice Call Continuity (SRVCC), potentially losing ground to competitors who have already adopted alternative solutions like CSFB for UMTS networks or active dual-mode operation for CDMA2000 networks, or they can adopt less than ideal solutions such as CSFB. Although CSFB is not an optimal solution due to its negative impact on user experience and the additional costs it imposes on the Voice over LTE (VoLTE) project deployment, providers will eventually need to transition to SRVCC as it represents the next step in the 4G LTE voice evolution. Furthermore, the current CSFB deployment requires extensive upgrades to all Mobile Switching Center (MSC) servers, complicating the decision-making process for operators, especially since mobile phone manufacturers plan to release compatible devices within a few months.

To assist operators in their decision-making, the paper suggests simplifying the CSFB implementation process, reducing both cost and time expenditure. Additionally, it emphasizes the need to address the significant delay in call setup time, a major drawback of CSFB. To achieve this improvement, a detailed analysis of the current CSFB implementation is necessary to determine whether the delay in call setup time is a universal issue or if it is only pronounced in certain call scenarios that require enhancement.
