This paper presents a method for obtaining precise 3d representations of the proximal femur from CT images, essential for designing artificial hips that match physiological characteristics. The process begins by narrowing the search range with adaptive windows informed by adjacent CT slices. Next, a multi-layer 2d contour matching technique corrects the outlines effectively. Complexity in the initial contours is managed using location and adjustment of the femur head's quasi-circular shapes. Key points on the hip joint, like the intersection of the head and neck, are precisely located using a distance transform-based projection method, yielding efficient 3d data extraction results. The paper demonstrates the accuracy of this technique through experiments.

The hip joint includes the round femur head, the connecting neck, and the main body of the femur. To craft a well-fitted artificial hip that aligns with the structure of the acetabular bone, extracting the hip's contour from imaging is critical. Traditional segmentation methods struggle with bone irregularities, fuzzy lines at the femur head and acetabular bone junction, low contrast, and noise. While no-seed region segmentation is a useful approach, its reliance on initial values is high. Non-parametric level set methods adapt well to low contrast but are computationally intensive. Previous solutions involve frame-by-frame dental contour extraction with region growing and radial line methods, which work well with fixed parameters but lack flexibility and automation for various quasi-circular femur segmentations.
