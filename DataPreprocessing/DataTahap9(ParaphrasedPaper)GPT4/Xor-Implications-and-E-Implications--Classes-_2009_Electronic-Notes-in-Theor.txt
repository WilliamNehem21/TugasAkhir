The Boolean operator known as exclusive or (XOR) is critical in programming, often being a fundamental component in various encryption methods such as DES, Blowfish, RC5, CAST, and Rijndael. One encryption technique, the "one-time pad," employs XOR to blend the plaintext with a random key.

Academic research has particularly focused on how well traditional logical tautologies hold up within fuzzy logicâ€”a field that greatly emphasizes fuzzy implications, which have significant applications across various disciplines. Recent publications have delved into different types of fuzzy implications.

Although the XOR function is useful in fuzzy logic to determine the extent to which precisely one of two statements is true, there currently isn't a standalone definition for the fuzzy XOR operation, meaning one that doesn't depend on other logical operators. The paper presents an independent definition for the fuzzy XOR connective, achieving the goal of autonomy.
