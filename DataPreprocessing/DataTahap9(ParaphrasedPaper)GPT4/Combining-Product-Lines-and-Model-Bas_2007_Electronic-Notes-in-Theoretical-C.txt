This academic paper discusses a method for describing product lines, emphasizing the structure and commonalities in the features of a product range. It proposes a system where the scope of a product line defines the shared features across all models. The scope is determined top-down, starting from the root node, which captures all the features shared by every variant in the product line. Features are added cumulatively as one moves down from the top of the tree structure to the various alternatives, with each lower tier inheriting the features of its predecessors.

To aid in depicting the similarities and differences between product models, the authors introduce a conceptual framework that focuses on the scopes of the alternatives. This allows for diagrams to only include features relevant to a particular alternative, thus simplifying the representation. Diagrammatic descriptions benefit from this separation as they align with the semi-lattice structure of the product line, categorizing features into three types: accessible, visible, and invisible, depending on their position relative to the current alternative.

The paper points out shortcomings in existing approaches that either focus solely on modeling variability without considering domain-specific elements or vice versa, thereby failing to provide a comprehensive method for defining product lines. In contrast, this approach integrates both variability and domain-specific aspects into a singular, well-defined model. This integration facilitates direct relationships between variability constraints and domain elements.

Furthermore, the paper introduces the notion of using a canonical extension of conceptual domain models to capture variability, setting it apart from other methods. Although other research acknowledges the relationship between variability and domain concepts, they tend to do so informally or through presence conditions, lacking an explicit integrated model. This paper, in contrast, provides a view-based diagrammatic process that allows for immediate application of domain-specific consistency conditions to the product line descriptions.
