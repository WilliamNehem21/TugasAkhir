The current understanding of the skin structure and sensory function of juvenile chameleons' integumentary system is limited. In a study conducted during the summer of 2015, fifteen juvenile Chameleo chameleons from Abu Rawash in the northern Giza region of Egypt were examined. These specimens belong to the Squamata order and the Chamaeleonidae family. The chameleons were classified into three age groups based on morphological characteristics such as head, abdomen, and limb lengths.

The dorsal surfaces of their abdomens are covered with scales that vary in size and shape, being either conical or elliptical. These scales are neatly arranged in rows and overlap each other. Each scale features a cylindrical, lenticular epidermal sense organ packed with dense sensilla. From a histological perspective, the scales exhibit wider conical surfaces connected by hinge regions. The outer surface of each scale is composed of a five-layered stratified squamous epithelium, which includes the stratum germinativum, abundant in the intermediate stratum spinosum, and the peripheral dermal layer beneath the stratum germinativum. Melanosomes, with their melanin granules, are located beneath the epidermis and extend long cellular processes. The dermis itself consists of an outer collagenous layer and an inner compact layer. Semithin sections revealed fibroblast cells, collagenous fibrils, nerve axons, melanosomes, and mast cells within the connective tissue core. An increase in cytokeratin immunoreaction was noted in the epidermal layers of the oldest group (G3), while increased proliferation of epidermal and dermal cells was observed in the youngest group (G1). Transmission electron microscopy unveiled complex dermal sense organs containing oligodendrocyte and Schwann cells, encapsulated by thin collagenous fibers, with both myelinated and unmyelinated nerve axons.

The juvenile chameleonsâ€™ skin is keratinized and demonstrates both external and internal sensitivity with a high concentration of mast cells in the dermis, contributing to immune defense. Additionally, melanosomes are scattered throughout the epidermis and dermis, allowing the animals to change color in response to their environment.

Integumentary sense organs are known to serve as mechanosensory and thermoreceptors, and potentially also detect humidity, in reptilian species like Amphibolurus barbatus and Iguanian lizards. They form complex tactile corpuscles, especially on the head skin surface of snakes, and are found in both fully aquatic and semi-aquatic elapid species.

At the ultrastructural level, the epidermis consists of five layers. The basal germinativum cells feature centrally located nuclei with dispersed euchromatin and distinctive nucleoli, with fine keratohyalin granules interspersed. The intermediate layer is rich in keratinocytes, which contain keratinohyalin granules, and electron-dense melanosomes are present in the stratum granulosum layer.

A notable discovery is that each dorsal body scale is associated with a single epidermal sense organ, which is lenticular and has dense sensory hairlet structures bearing bristles. Comparable sensory organs have been reported in a variety of reptiles, although typically with fewer emerging hairlet structures.

The study also observed that the epidermal sense organs connect deeply with the integumentary sense organs embedded in the dermal layer. These sense organs appear as oval-shaped bundles wrapped in a thin collagenous coating and comprise neuron types including Schwann and oligodendrocyte cells as well as myelinated and unmyelinated nerve axons.
