In this paper, we explore the relationship between two established frameworks for interactive system modeling. The first is reactive systems, as defined by Leifer and Milner, which use a reduction semantics to generate an interactive semantics. This interactive semantics, which is based on bisimilarity, is only compositional under stringent conditions. The second framework is universal coalgebra, which offers a categorical context in which bisimilarity can be understood as a final semantics, meaning the exclusive morphism to the final coalgebra.

To pursue this investigation, we start by detailing the theory of reactive systems, followed by an explanation of coalgebras and structured coalgebras. We then present a new coalgebraic representation of the labeled transition system (LTS) that reactive systems derive from reduction semantics. This adaptation raises the framework from the level of sets to algebras, which better reflects the syntactical structure of reactive systems.

Our results include a coalgebra not as a plain set but as a categorized family of sets, where each is indexed by a type. The states in an interactive labeled transition system (ILTS) are categorized by their source and target objects due to the nature of category theory arrows.

The Leifer and Milner reactive systems theory enables the generation of an LTS from a reduction semantics, which lacks labels. Labels are applied by considering the different contexts in which the system might interact. A key finding of this theory is that if the syntax-defining base category possesses certain colimits—specifically, rpos—then bisimilarity within the derived LTS maintains congruence.

We conclude the paper by summarizing our main contributions and proposing future avenues of research. Detailed proofs for several significant lemmas explored in the paper are provided separately.

In essence, this work bridges the gap between labeled and unlabeled transition systems by introducing a coalgebraic perspective, offering new insights into interactive systems modeling and enhancing the compositional understanding of abstract semantics in the process.
