The perceived inefficiencies in JVM (Java Virtual Machine) implementations might deter the use of Java for developing programming paradigms that prioritize efficiency. However, for Constraint Logic Programming (CLP), Java's widespread binary-compatible platform is attractive as it solves the issue of scarcity in widely used and easy-to-install CLP systems. Most web browsers come with built-in Java runtime, indicating its ubiquity across different hardware and software environments.

The paper is organized into various sections. Section 2 provides formal definitions of main concepts in AJACS, Section 3 outlines the Java implementation structure, Section 4 delves into how search space exploration is addressed, Section 5 compares AJACS with other methods, and Section 6 offers a conclusion and discusses future development plans.

The "store" in this context is an indexed collection of values meant for solving constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). Each store is a result of a constraint propagation step, thus it points back to an ancestor store, except for the initial store which has no ancestor. Every "line" within a store corresponds to a certain variable's values.

Values are potential integers that variables can have. Three internal representations exist for values: compact intervals (handled by class "Value"), non-compact intervals as bit sets (by class "FDDValue"), and non-compact intervals as disjoint unions of compact intervals (by class "FDIValue"). Transformations between these representations are based on their structure after an element is removed or intervals are combined.

The "Constraint" class includes an environment variable that stores constraints' surroundings and is initialized by a constructor method. The "update" method attempts to update variables within the environment except for a specified one, and it returns a "status" object.

The "Problem" class contains an initial store, a list of constraints, and a list made up of lists of "ConstVar". Using the "new" constructor, one creates a new problem with an initial store, two empty lists for constraints, and "ConstVar". Adding constraints and propagating the effects of assigning a new value to a store's variable is done through the "add" and "update" methods, respectively.

Lastly, defining search techniques is unrestricted. By creating a "Search" subclass, various strategies can be implemented, offering the flexibility to apply different search procedures such as depth-first, breadth-first, or best-first. The most effective strategy is problem-dependent, and the definition of a solution can vary with the search strategy used.
