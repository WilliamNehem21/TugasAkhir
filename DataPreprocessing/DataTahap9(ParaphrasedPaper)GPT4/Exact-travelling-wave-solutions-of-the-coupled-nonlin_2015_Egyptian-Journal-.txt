The novel (g'/g)-expansion method has proven to be an effective mathematical tool for deriving a wide range of exact traveling wave solutions, which are crucial in the context of physics and engineering. This method not only provides innovative solutions for single nonlinear evolution equations (NLEEs) but also for coupled NLEEs. The solutions discovered include various physical structures such as solitons, singular solitons, cuspons, kink-type solutions, singular kink solutions, periodic solutions, bell-type solitary waves, and other solitary wave solutions. The method's efficiency suggests that it can yield more precise solutions compared to other existing techniques, reinforcing its importance in resolving complex equations in scientific research.
