Recent research [2,12,15,18] has highlighted how to derive abstract interpretations of the control flow in higher-order programs using type effect systems. These systems predict discrete events and their sequence. Most commonly, the effects build simple labeled transition systems (LTSs) that enable the application of conventional model-checking algorithms to compare abstract program models with specifications. This analysis supports the automatic, static validation of various program characteristics, such as resource usage and access control.

The concept of utilizing abstract program interpretation for input in model checking, in order to verify specific program properties, has been delved into by several researchers [7,3,5]. In such studies, specifications involve temporal logics, regular languages, or finite automata, and the abstract control flow is represented as an LTS that takes the form of a finite automaton, grammar, or push-down automata. However, a formal methodology for deriving an LTS from higher-order programs is not provided.

Our system differs in its basis on linear types rather than effect types. Although the usage concept in this system resembles our history effects, the usages have a more intricate grammar and are not as compatible with model-checking. Other systems [8,4,14,5] implement LTSs from abstracted control-flow graphs to check security properties using temporal logic. While their approach has similarities to ours, we choose to concentrate on the programming language side rather than the model-checking aspect. Their methods assume a pre-existing control-flow graph abstraction suitable for first-order program analysis, in contrast to our language-level type-based approach which uses type inference as a scalable way to extract an abstract program interpretation.

In this summary, we discuss the transformation of FJSEC history effects and their utility. We introduce a stack transformation process called "stackification," which abstractly interprets possible runtime stack states, aiding in security analysis like Java's stack inspection. We also explain how exceptions are accounted for through a transformation named "exnization." Our methodology modularly handles different language features without needing to rework the type effect inference.

Our program analysis utilizes a type and effect inference system, where effects represent rough sketches of program histories. This permits the use of advanced type inference methods, such as constraint-based polymorphic subtyping, which is particularly advantageous in higher-order functional and object-oriented languages. For object-oriented contexts, our discussion includes a more thorough review of the type inference system and its benefits for Java.

Our approach is streamlined compared to methods that separately infer based on stack and history, like [reference missing]. We believe that our uniform approach simplifies and increases efficiency, which is particularly relevant for security mechanisms that rely on combining stack and history perspectives.
