The navigation system's posture error denotes the angle of incorrect alignment between the platform's coordinate system and the navigation coordinate system. In a Strapdown Inertial Navigation System (SINS), a quaternion represents the conversion relationship between the vehicle's coordinate system (System B) and the navigation coordinate system (System N). Therefore, errors in the calculation of the quaternion can determine the misalignment angle of the vehicle.
