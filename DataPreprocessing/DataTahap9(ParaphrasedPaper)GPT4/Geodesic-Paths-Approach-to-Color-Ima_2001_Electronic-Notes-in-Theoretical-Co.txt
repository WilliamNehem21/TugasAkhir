The study presents a novel filtering approach for processing multichannel images, offering a significant enhancement in reducing both impulsive and Gaussian noise compared to conventional noise-reduction techniques. This enhancement method integrates a smoothing operator inspired by random walk models, alongside a fuzzy measure assessing the similarity between pixels linked by digital geodesic paths. The performance of this new method exceeded that of traditional algorithms when evaluated on standard color images using objective image quality metrics. Additionally, the method provides features that aid in segmenting noisy color images effectively.

In the context of order statistics filters, the Vector Median Filter (VMF) is well-recognized. The VMF extends the classical single-channel median concept to multichannel data by arranging vector magnitudes based on their differences, which are measured using either the L1 (Manhattan) or L2 (Euclidean) norm.
