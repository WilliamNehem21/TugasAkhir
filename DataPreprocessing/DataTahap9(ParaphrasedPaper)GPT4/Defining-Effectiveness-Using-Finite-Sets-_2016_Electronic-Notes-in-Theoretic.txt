The concept of effectiveness found its peak in the 20th century but has roots in ancient knowledge across multiple domains. Our daily activities are partly inherited from our cultural background, but some of these actions are universal, found across all cultures. Arithmetic, for one, is a universal element of human cognitive activity, integral to every known civilization and central to our learning and development, particularly regarding number systems and their algorithms.

While classic challenges like squaring the circle or angle trisection using just a straightedge and compass have been proven unsolvable, these efforts illustrate the quest for specialized algorithms to address problems. Mathematics uniquely offers definitive proofs of impossibility. Further exploration revealed that straightedge and compass, coupled with simple algorithms for basic arithmetical operations, are not capable of resolving such problems.

In the last century, considerable progress was made in defining effective functions, evolving to include partial functions and recognizing that natural numbers, within a numeral system, should serve as the base for sets of inputs and outputs under consideration.

This paper proposes a novel approach, distinct from the effective topos and the work by Professor Robert Walters, to define effectiveness using category theory. We explore this alternative and its underlying motivation further in the following section.
