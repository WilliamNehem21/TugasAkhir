The paper discusses the concept of "completions," which are essentially aspects of a software model that provide additional details to enhance its functionality, such as locking mechanisms, monitors, or state managers. These refinements also include performance improvements, incorporating parameters like middleware properties to aid in analyzing non-functional properties of the system. The paper highlights that the order in which completions are integrated is crucial, as the sequence can impact subsequent completions and alter analysis results. Explicit specification of this order is required, as well as clear responsibilities for resolving conflicts that may arise from the overlaps between completions.

The authors explain the use of model-driven techniques to predict the performance and reliability of software systems. They point out that the cumulative effects of multiple design patterns, when applied to enhance quality of service or ensure consistency, are too complex to evaluate manually. Instead, they propose a model-driven approach for predicting how concurrency patterns affect the quality of system architecture.

The paper suggests using annotations to detail connector completions. One type defines the exact semantics of different connectors (such as 1:1, 1:n, or n:1, and their mechanisms like voting or replication), while the other describes how messages are processed (e.g., marshaling, encryption, compression), which is essential for precise performance modeling.

To minimize the potential conflicts between completions and integrate them smoothly into the development process, the authors propose mapping patterns to specific roles and responsibilities in the software development lifecycle. By analyzing meta-model elements, they identify possible conflicts and substantially reduce their complexity, focusing conflict resolution on select model elements.

The paper also touches on the use of adaptation patterns for predicting extra-functional properties like performance and reliability. It refers to earlier work that has classified adaptation patterns and incorporated them into predictive processes.

In summary, the paper presents an approach for integrating refinements (completions) into component-based systems that aims to reduce conflicts and improve prediction accuracy for non-functional properties like performance and reliability. It emphasizes the importance of a defined order for applying completions, clear annotations for connectors, and identifying roles and responsibilities within the software development process to manage potential conflicts effectively.
