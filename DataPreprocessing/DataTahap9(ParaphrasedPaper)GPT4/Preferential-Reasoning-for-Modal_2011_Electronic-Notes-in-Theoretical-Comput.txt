Multiple efforts have aimed to integrate defeasible reasoning into logics beyond propositional logic, with early work on preferential predicate logics by Lehmann and Magidor and more recent explorations into deontic logics and defeasible subsumption in description logics. However, there still isn't a widely accepted semantics for preferential reasoning in modal logics, nor a complete syntactic description to match it.

The formal structures in question are quite similar to those developed by Kraus, Lehmann, and Magidor, where propositional valuations are substituted by elements from a certain set, UN. Section 4 of the paper offers a detailed example that includes a case study of a modal preferential model.

In the realm of description logics, advancements by Casini and Straccia have allowed for improvements in algorithmic implementations. They suggested an operational approach to rational closure in the description logic, ALC, based on the principles set by Lehmann, Magidor, Freund, and Poole, which involves a series of classical entailment checks that can be relatively easily implemented. However, their framework does not include a semantic justification, and the number of entailment checks required is proportional to the square of the size of the knowledge base in question.
