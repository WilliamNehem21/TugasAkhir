Tracking a changing optimal solution in dynamic environments presents a significant challenge. To address this, the paper introduces an Improved Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm (IUMDA) for dynamic optimization problems. This method combines a diffusion model, which leverages information from the current population, and an inertia model, which incorporates historical data from previous optimal solutions. Upon detecting an environmental change, a detecting operator alters the strategy to enhance population diversity. An empirical study on a dynamic sphere function was conducted to evaluate the performance of IUMDA against Mutation UMDA, with findings indicating that IUMDA effectively adapts to environments with shifting optima.

The core objective of the algorithm is to track a changing optimal solution as the environment evolves. Intelligence optimization algorithms can effectively solve such problems. The continuous version of Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm (UMDA), which is a kind of estimation of distribution algorithm, has been widely used in various optimization issues.

In dynamic settings, when a problem changes, the subsequent optimal solution might shift from the current best-known solution, denoted by x*(t). To locate the new optimum, the algorithm needs to broaden its search area beyond the current population's domain. If an environmental shift happens at the end of generation t, coinciding with the k-th change, the population's optimal solution, represented by x*(t), will be applied to a specific formula to create a new individual xnew.

In essence, the paper proposes an algorithm tailored for dynamic environments with the aim of strategically increasing diversity to better predict new optimal positions based on prior optimal solutions.
