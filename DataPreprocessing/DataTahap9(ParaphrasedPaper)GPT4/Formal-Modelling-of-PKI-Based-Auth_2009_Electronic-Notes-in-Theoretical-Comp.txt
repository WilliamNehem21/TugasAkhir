This academic paper focuses on certain aspects of public key infrastructure (PKI) systems, specifically excluding comprehensive functions such as key generation and certificate revocation list management. The paper instead concentrates on operations related to authentication, the security knowledge of participants (users and servers), security tokens, and administrative tasks such as user management and trusting certificate authorities. It posits a closed environment for the PKI, where every user is identified with a single certificate and matching private key, and there is no need for entities to negotiate the use of cryptographic algorithms.

Digital certificates are utilized within PKI systems to bind public keys to the identity of certificate subjects, such as individuals, servers, or organizations, allowing the integrity and authenticity of those keys to be verified, even over public networks like the internet.

The paper assumes a particular context for the authentication server, like those found in banks or universities. Authentication involves validating certificates, ensuring users possess the corresponding private keys, and confirming their names are on the list of registered users. In contrast, open systems don't require such a list and base authentication solely on successful validation and verification.

The components of an authentication server's state are detailed, although they are not described in this summary. The paper also references the use of formal methods in designing and analyzing cryptographic and authentication protocols. It specifically notes prior work in formalizing PKI systems and the development of formal security analysis techniques. The authors also mention the combination of state-based Z specifications and event-based CSP models in reasoning about distributed applications.

In this work, the authors aim to formalize key components of certificate-based PKI to gain a clear and rigorous understanding and to construct a formal model for certificate-based PKI authentication. They express the formalization by combining elements of Z and CSP notations, and they validate their model with the ZTC tool to ensure its consistency.
