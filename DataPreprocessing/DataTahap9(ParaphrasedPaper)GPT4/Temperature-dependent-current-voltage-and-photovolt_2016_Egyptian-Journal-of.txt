The academic paper presents research on the creation and application of bismuth sulfide (Bi2S3)/copper thiocyanate (CuSCN) heterojunctions on glass substrates coated with fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO). These heterojunctions can serve as sensors for liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) at room temperature. Rath and colleagues also described the first solution-processed heterojunction solar cells combining p-type lead sulfide (PbS) quantum dots with n-type Bi2S3 nanocrystals, utilizing Bi2S3 as an electron acceptor layer, noting power conversion in their findings.

The rate at which Bi2S3 forms is determined by the presence of triethanolamine (TEA), which binds to Bi3+ ions, forming a complex Bi[(TEA)n]3+. To produce nickel-doped Bi2S3 films, nickel nitrate (Ni(NO3)2) is added to the process.

Analysis of the films through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) reveals the clustering of small crystallites, which impedes accurate grain size measurement, and a consistent spherical shape among the grains.

The study also delves into the temperature-dependent properties of a silicon (Si)/Bi2S3 heterojunction developed using the chemical bath deposition (CBD) technique. Results indicate that the junction's rectifying behavior, indicative of a barrier formation at the semiconductor interface, changes with temperature. Specifically, the ideality factor and series resistance decrease, while the potential barrier height increases as temperature rises. The photovoltaic efficiency of the junction remains low, which the researchers attribute to the presence of interfacial and barrier height inhomogeneity affecting the fill factor.
