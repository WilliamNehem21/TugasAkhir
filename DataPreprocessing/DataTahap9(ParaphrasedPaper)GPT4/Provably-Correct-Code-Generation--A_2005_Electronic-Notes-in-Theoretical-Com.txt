The academic paper discusses the significance of provably correct compilation in developing highly reliable software systems. The authors introduce an approach that ensures compilers generate accurate machine code from program source code using the framework of Horn logical semantics combined with partial evaluation. Key points include:

1. Establishing correct compilation is vital for high-assurance systems where any deviation from the intended behavior can have dire consequences.

2. Previous research has tackled correct compilation through various means including manual verification of compilers, automatically generating compilers from language semantics, and using program transformation systems.

3. This paper focuses on Horn logical semantics, a blend of operational and denotational semantics implemented using pure Prolog or Horn logic statements, providing a versatile view that can be considered both operationally and declaratively.

4. The authors also incorporate continuation semantics into this framework, showing that continuations can be described using Definite Clause Grammar (DCG) notation within Horn logic. This allows for hiding the store argument naturally in the semantics.

5. The paper illustrates the discussed approach using the SCR (Software Cost Reduction) specification language. It is shown that target code can be generated automatically and in a provably correct manner through partial evaluation.

6. The paper also explores resource-bounded partial evaluation, which facilitates resource-conscious compilation, considering constraints like time, space, or power consumption.

7. A problem addressed is that real machine instructions are not parameterized on a store as the generated code is, but this is resolved using the DCG notation.

8. While the paper initially models direct semantics, it extends to continuation semantics to better handle complex control structures like exceptions and goto statements.

9. Applications of this approach are not limited to academia; practical applications include the generation of code for parallelizing compilers, controllers specified in Ada, domain-specific languages, and the SCR framework.

10. The SCR grammar is detailed, explaining constructs such as types, variables, assumptions, assertions, and events, and an example is provided to demonstrate the compilation approach using partial evaluation to generate target code for the SCR specification language.

The authors conclude that Horn logical semantics is not only theoretically robust but can be practical as well, as evidenced by the application to the SCR language and the efficient code generation results. The approach promises faster code generation times than previous methods and ensures the correctness of the compilation process â€“ a factor of critical importance in high-assurance software systems.
