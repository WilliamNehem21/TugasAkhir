This academic article is structured in the following manner:

Section 2 illustrates how acceleration methods can expedite fixed-point calculations using a simple example. Section 3 revisits the foundational theories relevant to the study, with the key theoretical advancements presented in Section 4. Early experimental results on a variety of floating-point programs, which demonstrate the potential of the proposed methodology, are shared in Section 5. Sections 6 and 7 explore related research and future outlooks.

In the specific section highlighted, the authors discuss integrating acceleration techniques into abstract fixed-point computations with the aim of achieving this with minimal disruption to the standard iterative process. This ensures that the proposed method can be easily incorporated into existing static analyzers with only slight modifications.

The paper notes that while much research on abstract interpretation in static analysis has focused on developing or refining abstract domains, the process of abstract fixed-point computation has received less attention. Cousot and Cousot's initial contributions outlined methods to formulate widening operators, and Bourdoncle introduced iteration strategies that can minimize the approximation errors from widening. These existing methods are seen as complementary to the authors' technique. The authors make it clear that acceleration, which should occur at the same control points as widening, does not replace traditional widening, as it does not guarantee the termination of the computation. Nevertheless, it can significantly enhance the process by finding effective thresholds dynamically and automatically.

They reference the work of Gopan and Reps who used a similar idea of running parallel computations of the main iterations and a guide to improve the precision of fixed-point computations. In Gopan and Reps' framework, a 'pilot' value guides the process, which is analogous to the value 'yi' in the authorâ€™s Algorithm 1, although their approach does not modify the iteration function as in Gopan and Reps' work.

The authors express gratitude to colleagues X. Allamigeon and E. Goubault for their valuable conversations and advice, to S. Zennou for technical assistance with the analyzer based on Newspeak, and to anonymous reviewers for their constructive feedback.
