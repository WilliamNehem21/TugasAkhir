The paper discusses the pressing need to boost agricultural productivity to meet the demands of a growing population and the challenges posed by excessive reliance on chemical fertilizers and pesticides, inadequate infrastructure, and environmental degradation. It highlights the use of advanced techniques, like Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) and Machine Learning (ML), to assess the suitability of land for agricultural purposes and to support sustainable land management decisions.

Several studies have already applied these methods to a variety of issues in agriculture and land management, including evaluating land for specific crops, assessing irrigation systems, and identifying areas with tourism and conservation potential.

This study focuses on leveraging the Fuzzy Complex Proportional Assessment (FCoPRAS), Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), Random Forest and Multilayer Perceptron machine learning models to assess soil's agricultural potential. These methodologies include performance evaluation metrics such as ROC and accuracy rates. AHP was utilized to determine the significance of different variables, while expert opinions were factored into the FCoPRAS process. The Weighted Linear Combination Method (WLCM) was employed to integrate performance variables.

The paper emphasizes the utility of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in studying site suitability and generating land use maps. GIS allows for effective storage, processing, and analysis of complex data, while combining MCDA and ML with GIS enhances land use planning and management capabilities.

Moreover, this research details the function of Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks in assessing physical soil parameters—which are critical for understanding soil quality—and ultimately influencing crop health through factors like rainfall and nutrient availability. MLPs are presented as a form of feedforward neural networks that facilitate both forward input propagation and backward weight propagation. They consist of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer, with each layer's neurons fully interconnected to the next layer's neurons, allowing for the computation of the network's function.
