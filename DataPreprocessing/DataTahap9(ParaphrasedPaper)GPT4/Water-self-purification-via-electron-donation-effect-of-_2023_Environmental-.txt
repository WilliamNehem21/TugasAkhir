The scientific literature highlights how emerging contaminants (ECs) such as endocrine disruptors, pharmaceutical residuals, pesticides, and synthetic dyes are increasingly detected in natural water sources. Despite their low concentrations, these contaminants can be harmful, leading to bioconcentration and toxicological effects that threaten public water safety. Human exposure to these contaminants typically occurs through the consumption of tainted food and drink deriving from contaminated sources like soil, water, plants, animals, and microorganisms.

Due to their inclination to be hydrophobic, ECs are prone to build up in the fatty tissues of living organisms. Species atop the food chain are particularly susceptible to bioaccumulation and biomagnification of these contaminants. The resulting health impacts on humans include endocrine and immune system disruption, with potential consequences such as impaired brain development, premature puberty, fertility problems, and an increased risk of cancer.

Addressing the removal of ECs from water supplies is a complex challenge. Natural self-purification processes and traditional wastewater treatment methodologies often fall short. While current wastewater treatment technologies are relatively simple and cost-effective, they struggle to completely eliminate ECs because of their low concentration levels in water, the complexity of wastewater composition, and the resilience of ECs to degradation.
