In this paper, the authors discuss the use of Reo and Constraint Automata with State Memory (CASM) as tools for modeling choreographies in service compositions and for validating their conformance. Reo is a coordination model that builds complex coordinators, or connectors, from simpler ones. Constraint Automata and its extension, CASM, are operational semantics for Reo, which can be useful for representing the coordination and communication of web services.

Drawing from previous work that mapped BPEL (Business Process Execution Language) to Reo and Constraint Automata, the authors aim to create a unified formalism that can model both choreography and orchestration while allowing automatic analysis of their conformance. In their approach, they adjust Constraint Automata for state memory and define endpoint projection, which isolates a component's behavior within a choreography.

The paper is structured into seven sections, beginning with an introduction to Reo and CASM, followed by a discussion on modeling components of WS-CDL (Web Services Choreography Description Language). Subsequent sections delve into the theoretical background of endpoint projection and conformance problems, and then an empirical example is presented. The paper concludes with a review of related work and the authors' conclusions.

Choreographies are described as collections of activities executed by participants, and in the proposed model, each participant is a Reo component. The authors' model also maps WS-CDL roles, relationships, and channels into corresponding parts of a Reo circuit, demonstrating how Reo can model WS-CDL choreographies.

Conformance analysis is performed by extracting an endpoint's behavior from a choreography using endpoint projection and comparing it with the behavior of an actual implementation using simulation relations in CASM. The authors argue that a web service conforms to a choreography if every action it can perform is also allowed by the choreography's behavioral interfaces.

As an illustration, the authors present an adaptation of the bartering protocol, demonstrating their approach in a simplified context. The paper also references other works in the field that contribute to the formal specification and analysis of WS-CDL and related languages.

In summary, this research proposes a unified Reo and CASM-based methodology for expressing and analyzing conformance in service orchestrations and choreographies, with the goal of facilitating the automatic analysis of complex web service interactions.
