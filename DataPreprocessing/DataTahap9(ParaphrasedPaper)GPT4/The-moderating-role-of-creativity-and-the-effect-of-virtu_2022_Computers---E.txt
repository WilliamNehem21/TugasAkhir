This academic paper explores how virtual reality (VR) can potentially alleviate the situational stress and excessive cognitive demand (CD) experienced by pre-service teachers (PSTs) during teaching practice. Situational stress is a temporary form of stress induced by transient conditions, and for PSTs, this often arises during initial teaching experiences. Presence of stress reduces classroom effectiveness and may lead to burnout by increasing the psychological burden known as allostatic load. The study suggests that cultivating protective factors like creativity and mental flexibility (MF) may shield individuals from negative outcomes associated with stress and high CD environments like classrooms.

PSTs find teaching their peers and beginning to teach in real K-12 classrooms to be highly stressful and cognitively demanding. VR technology, using AI avatars, can simulate teaching scenarios that lower the stress and CD by eliminating audience effects, thus fostering greater creativity and MF which can buffer against stress.

The study aimed to compare VR and traditional microteaching environments to see how these teaching experiences affect PSTs in terms of stress, CD, creativity, and MF. It also examined whether creativity and MF could temper stress and CD.

To measure these dynamics, the study employed real-time neurocognitive and psychophysiological measures and psychological/behavioral metrics like the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking (TTCT). Data analysis utilized repeated measures ANOVA and path model analysis to investigate the relationships between variables.

The results suggested that VR offers a promising training platform for PSTs, potentially reducing stress and CD. VR enables realistic, controlled environments conducive to learning and practicing teaching skills, even allowing PSTs to encounter scenarios representing diverse student populations.

However, microteaching can induce higher stress and CD due to audience effects and unrealistic peer responses, distracting PSTs from learning. A tiered approach, gradually increasing scenario complexity, can boost stress tolerance and allow PSTs to develop the protective factors of creativity and MF.

Limitations of this study include gender imbalance among participants, potentially affecting the generalizability of the findings, and the lack of baseline data on PSTs' stress and CD levels prior to the program. Further research could track teacher development longitudinally and personalize VR activities to optimize individual teacher growth.
