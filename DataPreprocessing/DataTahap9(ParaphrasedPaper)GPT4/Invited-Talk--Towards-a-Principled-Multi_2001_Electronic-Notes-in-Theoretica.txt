At Yale University, researchers are developing a versatile common intermediate language named FLINT, designed to safely accommodate a broad range of programming paradigms, including the standard object-oriented model, higher-order generic programming, and Java-style reflection. Unlike the Common Language Runtime (CLR), FLINT's type system is not limited to a specific programming approach, yet it is comprehensive enough to express all sound propositions and proofs within higher-order predicate logic, which is essential for encapsulating and validating complex program characteristics.

FLINT's robust type system is particularly adept at type-checking both intermediate compiler code and low-level machine instructions. Consequently, type-checking can occur at any point during the compilation process, even subsequent to steps such as code optimization and register allocation. This capability promotes compiler robustness and program safety.

Additionally, the complexity and extensibility of virtual machines (VMs) are enhanced by FLINT's type system because it allows for the verification of low-level native routines, which traditionally reside within the VM. These routines can be certified and transferred to a secure library, streamlining the VM itself.

This discussion encapsulates the vision for the FLINT system, laying out the strategy behind its design and reviewing the array of technologies that could support its realization.
