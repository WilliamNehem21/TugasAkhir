This academic paper discusses an XML filtering system that employs a cost-based pattern transformation algorithm for approximate matching, which considers renaming, insertion, and deletion of XML items. Results are ranked based on their associated costs. Efficiency enhancements are achieved through sophisticated indexing and the use of a lazy functional programming language that prevents unnecessary data structure construction. The system's performance was evaluated using the XMark benchmark suite.

A related approach is ApproXXQL, which is an approximate query language that allows for similar transformations to identify the best match between a pattern and an XML document, though its expressiveness is somewhat limited compared to more modern query languages.

The system, named PHI, has been prototyped using Haskell, a lazy functional language, highlighting the benefits of laziness in avoiding the creation of unneeded data structures and achieving a simple and efficient implementation.

The paper details the structure of the study, including the definition of the filtering language, the reduction of the problem to tree matching, the approximate pattern matching algorithm, experimental evaluations, the benefits of lazy functional languages, and conclusions.

The key operator, "filteronebest," finds the best approximation when an exact match is not possible by allowing renaming, insertion, and deletion, with each operation having a fixed cost. The process discards injectivity for improved matching efficiency and aims to find matches even when no exact pattern instance is recognizable.

To optimize matching, the system encodes the data tree with indexes and captures insertion distances and renaming costs. Despite primarily serving approximate filtering, the algorithm can also execute exact matching by looking for zero-cost embeddings.

The study concludes with a benchmark using the XMark suite, demonstrating that their language can express most queries. It also highlights the practical application of filtering languages in managing web data overload and proposes future work that includes formalizing the language semantics and integrating it with an ontology reasoner.

In summary, the paper presents an XML filtering language designed for efficient approximate matching, benefiting from the combination of a lazy functional language implementation and sophisticated indexing, and shows its capability through rigorous benchmarking.
