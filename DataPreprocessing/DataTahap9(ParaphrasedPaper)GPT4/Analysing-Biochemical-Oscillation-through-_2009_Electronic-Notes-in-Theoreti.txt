In the study of biological systems with complex behaviors, it can be challenging to determine whether certain dynamics, such as oscillatory patterns, persist over time. Oscillations are common in biological systems, but it's not always straightforward to confirm whether these oscillations will continue indefinitely or eventually cease due to damping or disruption. While observing simulated data might suggest oscillatory behavior, confirming perpetual motion is harder. Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) models, due to being deterministic, can show perpetual periodic behavior, but this might be an artifact of their continuous nature.

This paper explores the use of formal methods—the application of computer science techniques like logic, automata, and formal languages—to define and verify the properties of biological systems, specifically their oscillatory behaviors. Employing probabilistic computation tree logic (PCTL) and continuous stochastic logic (CSL), the authors put forward an approach that allows for precise characterizations of system dynamics, including convergence to a value or bounded oscillations.

PCTL/CSL formulas serve as a query language enabling users to describe system properties for verification. Probabilistic model checkers, such as the PRISM tool employed in this study, can process these formulas applied to discrete stochastic models to confirm their validity.

The paper discusses examples from the literature, showcasing the formal approach's capacity to define and verify properties. Notably, the authors demonstrate the use of PRISM model checker for analyzing properties in the chosen models and highlight the more reliable quantitative solutions provided by model checking compared to approximate statistical solutions from simulations. This formal approach is applicable to general biological systems; however, it is currently limited to models with bounded state spaces.

The paper is structured to first introduce biochemical oscillators and present an example system. Then it discusses using temporal logic to represent oscillating systems' traits, followed by a description of probabilistic model checking. Further, it examines the Markovian model of the example system and the verification of its structural properties using PRISM. The paper concludes by summarizing the contributions made.

Finally, the paper observes that while continuous deterministic modeling can offer insights, it also has limitations, such as missing transient oscillations or not predicting system evolution from trivial fixed points. The authors suggest Markovian analysis and probabilistic/stochastic model checking as alternative approaches, which can state relevant properties in probabilistic temporal logic to be verified against a discrete stochastic model, showcasing this through a modified version of the running example system.
