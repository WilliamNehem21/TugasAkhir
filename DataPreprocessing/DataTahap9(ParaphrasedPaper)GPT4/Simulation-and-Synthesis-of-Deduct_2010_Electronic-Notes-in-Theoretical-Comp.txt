To paraphrase the given excerpt into a set of inference rules for a deduction calculus:

1. Hyperresolution Method:
   - In certain logics, one can derive inference rules from their clausal forms using hyperresolution.
   - Hyperresolution involves using range-restricted clauses, where all positive parents are ground clauses and all inferred conclusions are also ground clauses.
   - A negative, non-ground parent clause in a hyperresolution step is treated as an inference rule (I) in the ground calculus.
   - The positive, ground parent clauses in a hyperresolution step serve as the premises for rule (I) and the conclusions drawn are seen as the ruleâ€™s conclusions.

2. Redundancy Elimination:
   - Redundancy elimination is a concept borrowed from first-order resolution that is applicable to other calculi.
   - Three types of redundancy are identified: in formulae, rule applications, and notably, in inference rules themselves.
   - Reasoning that accounts for redundancy can lead to stronger results and more optimized modal deduction calculi.

3. Empirical Testing:
   - Empirical studies, such as those conducted with (M)SPASS, use this approach to enable meaningful comparisons of different deduction calculi or deduction styles.
   - These comparisons are more substantive than those arising from independently implemented provers.

It is important to highlight that the goal of creating a sound, complete, and terminating deduction calculus for a given logic is not always achievable given the complexity of automating calculus synthesis. However, for a large number of logics, it is feasible to extract such a calculus that holds these desired properties. When logic is decidable, ensuring termination is also a key consideration in the design of these calculi.

For more detailed information, references [6, 22, 24] provide in-depth explanations regarding the extraction of inference rules using hyperresolution and references [5, 16] contain empirical comparisons illustrating the effectiveness of these concepts in practice.
