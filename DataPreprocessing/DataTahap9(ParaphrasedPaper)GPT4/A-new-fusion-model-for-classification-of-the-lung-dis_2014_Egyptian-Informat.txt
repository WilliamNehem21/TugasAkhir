The abstract describes a study that focuses on the automatic classification of lung diseases using computed tomography (CT) images, which is a significant component of computer-aided diagnosis systems. The researchers introduce a novel image-based feature extraction technique that combines the strengths of Gabor filters and Walsh-Hadamard transform via a median absolute deviation (MAD) method. The approach consists of three stages:

1. Preprocessing of CT images and feature extraction using the fusion-based technique.
2. Feature selection using a genetic algorithm to identify the most relevant features.
3. Classification using various algorithms—Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Networks (MLP-NN)—to identify different lung diseases.

A dataset including 400 CT images representing conditions such as bronchitis, emphysema, pleural effusion, and normal lung tissue was employed for training and testing. The MLP-NN classifier achieved a classification accuracy of over 90%.

The study also highlights the importance of CT images in clinical diagnosis and the evolution of CT imaging as a key diagnostic tool. Noise reduction and image enhancement techniques like median filtering and morphological smoothing were utilized in preprocessing. The study notes the effectiveness of statistical methods in analyzing textures, which can help reveal structural abnormalities in medical images.

The work concludes that the proposed feature extraction method, along with genetic algorithm-based feature selection, and the MLP-NN classifier leads to high accuracy in detecting lung diseases. This system demonstrates potential for assisting physicians with diagnoses and could be expanded with more feature extraction and selection methods to include additional lung diseases.
