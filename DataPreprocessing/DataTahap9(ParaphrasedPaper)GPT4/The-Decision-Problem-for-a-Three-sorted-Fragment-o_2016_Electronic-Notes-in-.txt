In a more recent study, it was found that the satisfiability problem for the three-level quantified syllogistic (3LQSR), which includes variables of three different types, is decidable. This conclusion drew upon the decision method for 3LQSR, which itself took inspiration from the approach used to confirm that the three-level syllogistic with singletons and unions of pairs (3LSSPU) is decidable. The concept of relativized interpretation, mentioned in the original study, may be thought of as a modification of the small model assignment concept. Although the 3LQSR language and its subsequent version, 3LQSTR, don't support the expression of the general union construct, this construct is intrinsic to 3LSSPU.

Subsequent research indicated that the satisfiability problem for the four-level quantified syllogistic (4LQSR), which incorporates variables across four categories, is also decidable. This finding proved useful in demonstrating the decidability of a comprehensive description logic that allows atoms in the two-level syllogistic (2LS) fragment, previously established as decidable.

It was also observed that when considering a set X = {x1, ..., xk} as a level 0, quantifier-free atomic formula in 3LQSTR, one can represent 2LS, which includes finite enumerations, using 3LQSTR formulas. However, such a formula at level 0 is not purely universal, nor are the variables x1, ..., xn associated with another variable z. In more complex scenarios, one may require 3LQSR formulas of exponential length in n, which demonstrates that the 3LQSTR fragment is more restrictive.
