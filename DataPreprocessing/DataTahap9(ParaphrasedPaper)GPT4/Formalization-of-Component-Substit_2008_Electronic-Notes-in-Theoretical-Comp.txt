Component-based software engineering has become the cornerstone of creating large-scale, high-quality software systems. This approach often involves assembling software from a collection of shared components that are produced and maintained by different vendors. These components operate as individual, opaque units, which increases the need for methods to establish and maintain component compatibility and functional interaction.

Methods have been developed to ensure that components can be substituted for one another reliably, based on the Liskov Substitution Principle, which was originally formulated in the context of object-oriented programming. These methods typically involve subtyping, where a new component (C_new) can only replace an existing component (C_old) if C_new is a subtype of C_old. This practice incorporates not only classical interface types but also behavior specifications like automata to describe component functionality. However, this strict subtyping approach can be overly restrictive and exclude feasible substitutions.

More recent research proposes a less restrictive concept of substitutability that takes into account the specific context in which components are used. With contextual substitutability, C_new can safely substitute C_old under certain conditions, disregarding interfaces that are not employed in the current system environment.

The paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 defines how components describe their dependencies, using a mail server on Linux GNU as an example. Section 3 outlines a method for determining substitutability through a series of refined definitions. Section 4 provides examples to illustrate substitutability, while Section 5 introduces the algorithm used to check for safe substitutions. Section 6 reviews related research, and Section 7 concludes the paper and suggests directions for future research.

Additionally, the paper differentiates between intra-dependencies, which are defined by component producers for installation purposes, and inter-dependencies, which emerge during installation and are important for deinstalling or replacing components. The paper also introduces the idea of contextual substitutability, which is a practical approximation of the full context of the target system, considering the resources and architecture but scaled to manage efficiently. This contextual approach expands upon traditional substitutability criteria by acknowledging various component effects on the system and potential conflicts while still ensuring system safety. The paper even hints at an extension to this framework, not covered in the current discussion, which involves specifying non-functional properties of components, noting that component replacement can impact system-wide properties and therefore may be subject to constraints.
