The paper outlines its structure and main points as follows. Section 2 introduces the concept of finitely determined operations and describes their role in defining a general semantic operator called tp,c. Section 3 demonstrates how this operator encapsulates the three specific cases previously mentioned. In Section 4, the paper examines the monotonicity and Scott continuity of tp,c. Section 5 considers the possibility of computing tp,c using artificial neural networks. The paper concludes with Section 6, where the authors present their final thoughts.

The paper discusses different types of semirings, noting that traditional two-valued logic (semiring i) is finitely determined, while semirings ii, iii, and iv are not. However, by using finite approximations with a set number of intervals, semiring ii can be seen as finitely determined logic, and semirings iii and iv can have finitely determined disjunctions. Whether semiring v is finitely determined depends on whether set a is finite.

The paper concludes by examining a simple example of a constraint problem that can be formulated as a SCLP and potentially solved using an artificial neural network (as shown in theorem 5.1). This example illustrates the feasibility of solving a CSP, combining constraints, and projecting over a subset of variables using logic programming techniques.
