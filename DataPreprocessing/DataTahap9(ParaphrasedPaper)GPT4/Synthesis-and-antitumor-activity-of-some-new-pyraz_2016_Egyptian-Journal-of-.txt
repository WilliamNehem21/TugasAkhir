A series of pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine-3-carbonitrile and pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridine-3-carbonitrile derivatives was created using 5-amino-1-tosyl-1H-pyrazole-3,4-dicarbonitrile as the core starting material, reacting it with an assortment of electrophilic and nucleophilic agents. The structures of these newly created compounds were verified using modern analytical techniques such as IR, 1H NMR, and mass spectrometry. The compounds were examined for their cytotoxicity against human laryngeal epidermoid carcinoma cells (HEp-2), and two compounds, labeled as 3 and 4, showed noteworthy effectiveness.

In a synthesis process, p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide was reacted with tetracyanoethylene to produce a precursor compound. This mixture was stirred and then heated under reflux before cooling down to yield a white precipitate.

Subsequently, the precursor compound 2 was suspended in pyridine and reacted with carbon disulfide over a prolonged period, then neutralized and recrystallized to obtain the dark green product 3. Similarly, the compound 2 was reacted with formamide and DMF to create the yellow product 8.

Further reactions included mixing triethyl orthoformate and acetic anhydride with compound 2. The reaction mixture was refluxed and the resulting product, 9, was obtained as a yellow powder after recrystallization.

The reaction of the compound 9 with hydrazine hydrate produced the yellow product 10, and the reaction of the compound 2 with malononitrile, catalyzed by piperidine in DMF, resulted in the brown product 13 after crystallization.

Finally, compound 2's reaction with ethyl acetoacetate in the presence of potassium carbonate in DMF yielded a complex product. The reaction's NMR spectrum displayed specific chemical shifts, such as a singlet for the methyl group at 2.35 ppm, a singlet for the amino group at 6.40 ppm, and doublet signals for the para-disubstituted benzene ring. Additionally, the reaction of compound 2 with phenyl isothiocyanate led to a derivative with characteristic NMR signals indicating the formation of distinct functional groups.
