This paper introduces an innovative approach to static analysis of computer software using abstract interpretation, by adapting sweeping line techniques from computational geometry. The authors explore the application of the sweeping line concept to represent elements within a numerical abstract domain of boxes, an extension of the classic interval domain that allows a finite number of disjunctions. They offer a comprehensive examination of this representation and the associated algorithms for standard domain operations. Additionally, the paper introduces a new, highly precise widening operator for this domain.

The paper is organized into eight sections. Section 2 details the specific problem addressed by the research. Section 3 describes the adaptation of the sweeping line technique for the problem at hand. Section 4 delves into the representation of the domain of boxes elements, while Section 5 discusses how the domain operators are implemented. Section 6 introduces the novel widening operator for the domain of boxes. Section 7 considers transfer functions, and the paper concludes with Section 8.

The authors aim to extend the basic domain of intervals, which can only represent convex sets, to enable representation of finite disjunctions of intervals. They provide a formal definition of this extension. Within the abstract domain of intervals, a set of variables and a choice of rings, either reals (R), rationals (Q), or integers (Z), are specified.

The concept of the sweeping line is envisioned as a vertical line that sweeps across a plane, pausing at certain points. With each stop, an associated data structure is updated. Upon completion of the sweep, a result is derived from this data structure, contributing to the analysis aimed at improving software static analysis techniques.
