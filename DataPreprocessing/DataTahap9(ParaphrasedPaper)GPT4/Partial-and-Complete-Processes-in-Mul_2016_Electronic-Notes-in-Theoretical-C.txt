The paper discusses a method for simplifying the development of processes in multiparty conversations, where participants with similar roles follow a standard pattern and differ mainly in who they send to and receive messages from. The authors introduce a tool for writing processes in a "partial syntax" that omits specific sender and receiver names, which can then be automatically converted into complete processes with operational semantics defined.

The conversion rules from partial to complete processes are established in natural semantics and are accompanied by a translation and type-checking function written in an ML-like language. The approach allows for lighter and more flexible development, with the ability to prove the soundness and completeness of the translation rules and algorithm.

The concept stems from financial protocol applications and the development of the Scribble language. The paper builds on previous theoretical work on multiparty session types and offers a new syntax to accommodate asynchronous communications and self-adaptation in protocol participants.

Examples are used to illustrate global types and partial syntax, followed by a full calculus and type system presented in subsequent sections. In one specified protocol (manager-factories protocol), participants are coded by numbers, with a master multicast communication and subsequent interactions defined by the global type "GA." The paper also explores protocol enhancement through delegation, where additional communications between factories and a transport company are introduced in a new session.

Finally, the paper extends the protocol to include recursive branching behavior, allowing a manager to engage in negotiations with factories to determine the supply of items. This scenario explores different outcomes based on the negotiation process.

Overall, the paper aims to improve the way similar participants are implemented in multiparty sessions by providing a more flexible syntax and automatic translation to fully specified processes.
