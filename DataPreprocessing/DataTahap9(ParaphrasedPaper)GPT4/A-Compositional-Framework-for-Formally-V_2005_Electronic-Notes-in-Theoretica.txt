This scholarly article introduces a tool-supported framework within which one can verify that the interaction of various parts of a complex system results in the adherence to a specified overall system property. Through a compositional inference rule embedded in the logic of the PVS theorem prover, the framework's capabilities are showcased. Detailed methodological guidelines on how to deploy the rule are provided, and the framework's effectiveness is demonstrated through application to a representative control system.

The selected example to illustrate the application of the Trio specification language involves a basic but informative scenario: a reservoir and its associated controller. When the reservoir's liquid level falls below a certain threshold, the controller opens a valve to refill it. The reservoir is also subject to nondeterministic leakages.

In detail, the paper delves into a compositional inference rule pertinent to the Trio language and framed within the rely/guarantee concept. Albeit the rule's soundness is assumed, detailed proof is omitted for conciseness.

The semantics for rely/guarantee specs are fleshed out, introducing a novel temporal operator to link the assumptions of one module with its guarantees. These semantics are then incorporated into the PVS theorem prover. To do this, the modular aspects of Trio are mapped onto the PVS language, and several strategies are established to facilitate automated PVS proof of Trio specs. Notably, each Trio class corresponds to a PVS theory, with minor tweaks to accommodate Trio's semantics of module importing, given the differences between the two systems' handling of theory instances and reuse.

The paper acknowledges that certain Trio language features like inheritance and visibility are tricky to translate directly into PVS constructs and instead suggests that front-end tools, currently in development, could bridge this gap by automatically converting Trio code to PVS code. 

The authors elaborate on a two-step refinement process used in specifying the behavior of the reservoir system. Initial class versions describe basic behaviors without assuming any environmental interactions. More detailed versions integrate environmental assumptions and derived properties based on rely/guarantee principles, with multiple refinement steps being possible to increase the level of detail as needed.

For a practical system composition, one must validate (discharge) the Trio-made assumptions against other system component behaviors. Successful assumption discharges affirm the derived system properties and the overall intended behavior, using the introduced rule and framework.

Finally, the paper summarizes the deliverables: a compositional, tool-aided framework designed for the Trio specification language, accomplished through a PVS-encoded inference rule and an array of strategic support. This tooling is applied to a control system case study as detailed in the article, exemplifying the framework's utility in guaranteeing desired properties within a complex integrated system.
