Component-Based Software Engineering (CBSE) is a method that focuses on the assembly of pre-existing software units, including commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) products. Despite utilizing tested and reliable components, ensuring the overall application's reliability is challenging. Techniques for assessing reliability of CBSE applications have been developed and they primarily fall into two categories: those that depend on empirical data and others that are based on expert insights, which can be more time-consuming. A proposed model aims to improve reliability estimation in CBSE systems by combining the strengths of fuzzy logic and neural networks, specifically by using an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), which offers advantages over traditional Fuzzy Inference Systems (FIS) thanks to its ability to learn from data, much like neural networks.

The paper is structured into sections, covering related work, the framework and presentation of the proposed model, experiments, and their results, concluding with discussions and conclusions.

Fiondella et al. (2013) introduced a COCOF approach that assesses software reliability by considering components' failure correlations and architecture. This involves transforming a multivariate Bernoulli distribution into a joint distribution for component outcomes. Palviainen et al. (2011) discussed a method for evaluating, predicting, and measuring CBS reliability, emphasizing its critical role in safety-sensitive systems and integrating reliability at the component level.

Soft computing approaches for reliability estimation typically involve support vector machines (SVMs), genetic algorithms (GAs), and fuzzy logic. Lo (2010) suggested an estimation model based on an SVM and a GA, relying less on historical failure data by having the GA determine SVM reliability estimation parameters.

ANFIS, introduced by Jang in 1992, combine fuzzy systems with neural networksâ€™ learning capabilities, outperforming traditional FIS models. The operational profile (OP) and component dependency are crucial elements in CBSE reliability estimation. The OP defines the usage pattern for software, while component dependency affects system reliability due to interconnections in a CBSE system.

The proposed model in the paper is additive, not considering the CBSE's architecture and instead focusing on application complexity measured by integration code. The studied FIS has four input factors: reusability, application complexity, component dependency, and operational profile. A set of 81 rules was established based on these factors, classifying them into three levels: low, medium, and high. The ANFIS was trained and tested with project data, some of which were allocated for training, testing, and deriving the results.
