The academic paper discusses the SECSpaces coordination model, which enhances tuple-based coordination spaces with mechanisms to control and authenticate access to entries through the concept of abstract partitions. The authors acknowledge a limitation of SECSpaces in its inability to support atomic access to multiple partitions simultaneously. To address this, an operator for combining partitions is introduced, allowing output operations to make an entry visible across multiple partitions and data-retrieval operations to atomically access multiple partitions. The flexibility of this new mechanism is demonstrated using examples.

The paper also outlines the broader context of data-driven coordination models like Linda, which traditionally lack access control features. This lack of control introduces security risks in open and distributed applications like web services, mobile ad hoc networks, and peer-to-peer systems. SECOS, an earlier model, attempted to address this by associating access rights with the data itself, using locks which could be symmetric (using the same key for protection and access) or asymmetric (using a pair of keys).

Building upon SECOS, SECSpaces refines access control, allowing tuples (or entries) to carry two types of access information for non-destructive reading and destructive input operations. The paper explores the need to modify access control policies dynamically, as application requirements change over time, and extends SECSpaces to support such changes without directly overhauling existing access control configurations.

The coordination primitives of SECSpaces are consistent with Linda’s classical operations—out(e), in(t), and rd(t)—with the addition of control fields specific to rd and in operations for access permission differentiation. The authors explain how the asymmetric partition fields distinguish write and read/remove permissions.

SECSpaces' functionalities include the ability to combine partitions to manage group access, making it possible to include or exclude processes from groups securely. To illustrate these capabilities, they propose a merge operator for managing restrictions between subgroups and describe how to dynamically coordinate interactions between independent groups of processes, enhancing the model’s flexibility for runtime data access and control among various user groups.
