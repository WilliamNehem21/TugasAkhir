Recent years have seen the Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) approach become increasingly influential in software engineering, encompassing strategies like Model-Driven Development (MDD) and Model-Based Testing. The central concept of MDA is the Platform-Independent Model (PIM), which is the primary source for subsequent transformations to Platform-Specific Models (PSM), as well as for code generation, validation, verification, and testing. In this way, the model lies at the heart of the software development lifecycle.

Despite its ubiquity, the Unified Modeling Language (UML), enhanced by the Object Constraint Language (OCL) for navigating models and formulating constraints, suffers from only loosely defined modeling techniques lacking formal semantics. While some static semantics are defined by OCL constraints, behavioral semantics and additional static semantics are often delineated in a natural language that introduces ambiguities.

The imprecision in UML's definition is a deliberate choice, enabling the language's adaptation across various software systems through semantic variation points. Domains with special requirements often employ UML profiles, specialized adaptations that extend UML. Yet, the formalization of static semantics remains insufficient for guaranteeing sound model structures, leading to reliance on the processing tools' capacity to validate models.

Semantics within UML could be improved through careful examination of the UML specification and the formulation of explicit constraints. The language specification comprises two components: syntax, split into abstract and concrete forms, and semantics, which provide meaning through static semantics defining correct syntactic compositions, and behavioral semantics detailing runtime properties.

Critics argue for the necessity of formality, emphasizing clarity, expandability, and interoperability. This does not imply exhaustive specification within UML but rather a robust foundation conducive to domain-specific tailoring.

To define static semantics, the OCL is a useful tool; it enables the navigation and automatic verification of models, but current OCL constraints in UML are often flawed and incomplete. The validation process, as performed by the USE tool, reads textual notation metamodels, implementing set-theoretic semantics and evaluating associated OCL constraints, whose complexity of evaluation is polynomial to the model's size and constraint intricacy.

The USE tool can process instance models based on UML metamodels, which include elements like classes and objects, providing an important layer of automated validation before proceeding with further development activities like simulation or code generation.

However, for this tool to be effective, it necessitates the formalization of both static semantics in UML and any used profiles. Once these tasks are completed, automated validation can feasibly ensure the integrity and compliance of the models.

Considerable research has addressed UML's behavioral semantics, which differ depending on the application domain in consideration. In contrast, static semantics tend to be generalized and formalized, as demonstrated in this study.

The paper extends prior work that validated OCL constraints for UML metamodels to include UML2.1, making contributions by not just correcting existing constraints but also formalizing natural language constraints and addressing absent ones, specifically concerning class and object diagrams.

Validating profiles, as shown with an example, can be replicated for other profiles, ensuring that applications built on clear and unequivocal models are strong and reliable, with OCL providing the means to deal with complex constraints.

The paper concludes by encouraging the further development of UML's static semantics to solidify the language's foundation and by acknowledging that significant advancements in UML standards are not anticipated in the near future, underscoring the enduring value of improvements to static semantics.
