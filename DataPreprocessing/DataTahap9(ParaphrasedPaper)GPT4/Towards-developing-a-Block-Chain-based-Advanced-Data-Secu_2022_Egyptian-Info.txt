The academic paper discusses the integration of information technology and advanced communication methods in smart cities to facilitate intelligent operations using a variety of devices, such as sensors and IoT gadgets. Cloud sensing methods and crowd sensing models are increasingly applied for efficient data sensing and solving. The paper also outlines future sections on related work, a detailed proposal, evaluation results, conclusions, and enhancements, particularly about security for crowd sensing models.

Privacy issues in communication models and transaction services are addressed within the paper, with crowd sensing highlighted as a means to achieve cost-effectiveness and leverage human intelligence. The paper critiques Amazon Mechanical Turk for vulnerabilities and data leakage, and notes the development of privacy protection techniques, like privacy wrappers and group signature strategies, to safeguard privacy in crowd sensing models. Distributed authority mechanisms are employed to boost trust, and blockchain models are discussed for decentralization and security enhancement.

Various blockchain applications are considered, including participant identity and access management, and implementing smart contracts for automation in IoT. However, issues persist concerning privacy protection and participant dishonesty. The paper proposes a blockchain-based reward and security model, named DSECCS, aimed at addressing these challenges by integrating smart contracts and eschewing reliance on third-party authorities, with rewards distributed based on bid rates and data quality.

The proposed DSECCS model is tested for its efficiency in network evaluation and security aspects, showing improved performance compared to existing models.
