This academic paper is structured in the following manner. Section 2 presents two novel approaches for the detection of road edges. Section 3 discusses the initial determination of position based on these road edge detection techniques. Section 4 describes the experiments conducted to test these methods. The paper concludes with Section 5 summarizing the findings and identifying directions for future research.

Key to the color-based method described in the paper is the integration of color and edge features to improve road edge detection, as relying on a single feature type can be problematic due to issues like shadows. The method exploits the fact that on either side of a road edge, colors tend to be distinct and the image gradient at the road edge is typically large. By examining the colors of the road and adjacent non-road areas at points of high gradient, the method discerns potential road edge points.

The paper exemplifies the method in a scenario where the area adjacent to the road is a green belt and the focus is on detecting the road's right edge. Initially, Canny edge detection is performed on a grayscale version of the input image, referred to as "C". The original image is then converted into the HSV color space, denoted as "M". 

A binary image is generated from "M" by applying a formula at each point that identifies green points as white and all others as black. This is done using the pixel gray value "f(x)" and the hue "H" and saturation "S" components of the pixel, with specific ranges for "H" and "S" defining green pixels.

Should the total number of candidate edge points, "T", and the number of points in "C", "P", meet certain criteria, it may indicate the absence of shadows and indistinct road edges. In this case, the procedure would shift to an alternative threshold segmentation method. If not, the original method proceeds to refine the road edge line using the candidate points.

For threshold segmentation, the image is converted to a grayscale version and each pixel is evaluated. The optimal threshold "T" is determined using the maximum between-class variance criterion, which is then used to produce a binary image. Canny edge detection is applied again, and a scan from left to right (when detecting the right edge) locates the first white pixels. These pixels are used as inputs for a Hough transform to define the road edge.
