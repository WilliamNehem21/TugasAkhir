To enhance team-based software development, we have created a refactoring-aware repository provider that functions as an extension to the Java Development Tools within the Eclipse environment. This system acknowledges refactorings as primary modifications expressed through semantic actions instead of as a diffuse set of textual changes across the codebase. Besides, we introduced a refactoring-aware merge process that merges both traditional changes and refactorings by utilizing the semantic context to identify and reconcile conflicts while preserving the intended meaning of refactorings post-merge.

Refactorings are systematic code improvements that maintain semantic integrity, such as when a variable is renamed, all references consistently reflect the new name. Unfortunately, the benefits of refactorings may be undermined in a typical team development setup due to inadequate tool support. Problems arise during merges, as preconditions verified on separate branches might not hold on the merged codebase, resulting in potential semantic inconsistencies.

To remedy this, our refactoring-aware repository provider records both standard edits and full refactorings, enabling comparison between two versions in terms of refactoring operations. During merges, this semantic awareness aids in more accurate conflict detection and resolution, and in some cases can automate merges that traditional tools could not handle. We've prototyped this concept with support for refactoring-aware automatic merges of rename and move operations alongside manual changes in Eclipse.

The academic paper continues by detailing the intricacies of various merge strategies (textual, structural, and semantic approaches), discusses the potential limitations of traditional merge tools, and underscores the superiority of understanding the semantics and developer intent behind refactorings for a more effective merge. It explains how the prototype plugin in Eclipse functions, how it processes manual changes, and the significance of preserving node identity to maintain the integrity of the source code structure post-refactoring.

The paper compares this approach to other semantic merge techniques and tools recognizing renamed entities, noting that our approach is unique in focusing on well-defined semantic refactorings from a developer's point of view. Future work aims to expand support for additional refactorings and to further validate the approach in practice.
