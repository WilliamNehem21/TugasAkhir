The research paper focuses on creating an interpolation method that reliably maintains the shape of monotone and convex datasets. It introduces a rational bi-cubic function with specific parameters for the task. By imposing straightforward constraints related to the data on these parameters within each rectangular domain, the paper ensures the monotonicity and convexity of the interpolated shapes. This method is efficient, cost-effective, and yields smooth surfaces.

Monotonicity is essential in calibrating devices like DACs and ADCs, as well as in evaluating various scientific quantities like ESR in cancer patients or uric acid levels in gout patients. Convexity is important in fields such as nonlinear programming and scientific design applications.

Asaturyan's work is referenced, which identified loss of convexity in data interpolation and tackled it with a subdivision scheme that divided problem areas into smaller regions for processing. However, this method impacted the entire domain when modifying a single sub-rectangle.

The paper's proposed scheme utilizes a rational bi-cubic function characterized by eight parameters in each rectangular patch. By carefully setting the range for these parameters, the interpolation preserves the original data's shape. This approach is effective on raw data as well as on data with derivative information, enabling local control over the surface and ensuring C1 continuity (smoothness).
