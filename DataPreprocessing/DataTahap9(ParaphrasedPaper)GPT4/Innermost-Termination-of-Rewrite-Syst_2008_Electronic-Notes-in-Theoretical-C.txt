This academic paper explores the limitations and applications of predictive labeling, a method used to determine if rewriting systems terminate. Initially, it points out that predictive labeling methods previously designed for quasi-models are not directly applicable to systems focused on innermost termination, noting that their core theorem does not hold in this context.

The paper proceeds to illustrate through an example that semantic labeling with models is applicable to proving innermost termination, despite the example not demonstrating decreasing rules when using models. It also mentions the soundness of semantic labeling with models for innermost termination and goes beyond to incorporate usable rules for a more robust result.

Further, it discusses how innermost reductions in one system can be transformed into infinite innermost reductions in another system using the concept of semantic labeling. This transformation is crucial for establishing their main theorem concerning innermost termination.

The primary contribution of the paper is showing that semantic labeling is indeed effective for proving innermost termination when applied with models. Moreover, they have refined predictive labeling techniques to only require models for the usable rules instead of all rules, and have enhanced these approaches by integrating argument filters.

Finally, the paper notes that previous work on semantic and predictive labeling for termination has been incorporated into the termination prover tool TPA. It suggests that adaptation of these results to handle innermost termination should be straightforward, and anticipates that augmenting TPA with the new findings will boost its capabilities in automatic termination proving.
