The administration of medication is a detailed multi-step process involving various healthcare professionals, with medication errors potentially occurring at every stage. Approximately 38% of these errors take place during the administration phase, an activity that occupies around 40% of a nurse's time. Nurses serve as the final checkpoint to prevent errors from reaching patients and are primarily responsible for reporting medication errors, even though they might sometimes be the ones to commit or witness these errors.

Unlike traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs) that are trained using backpropagation algorithms, in Extreme Learning Machines (ELM), the weights for the hidden layer are randomly assigned and remain constant without iterative adjustments. Activation functions are then applied to the hidden neurons. The only parameters that are adjusted during training are the weights connecting the hidden layer to the output layer, allowing the hidden neuron parameters to be training data-independent, thereby potentially achieving nearly optimal generalization compared to traditional FNNs. According to theoretical research, ELMs possess universal approximation and classification capabilities.

The paper suggests that adding more variables leads only to marginal improvements in predictive abilities and recommends utilizing a small number of variables for more effective visualizations, ideally no more than four. This is based on research indicating that fewer variables can lead to clearer, more comprehensive visualizations.

In conclusion, the paper notes that individuals with very high or very low trust in their peers are more likely to report medication errors, while individuals with medium to medium-low levels of trust are less certain about reporting. The length of time employees have worked in the unit also influences their likelihood of reporting errors. Additionally, those more inclined to report errors tend to be relatively new to the unit (4-5 years) and possess a level of trust that is just above low trust, based on responses to organizational trust and work climate questions.
