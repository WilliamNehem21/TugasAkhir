In the academic paper, the authors present a strategy for a coloring game, likely involving a graph with vertices and a competitive scenario between two players, Alice and Bob. The following is a paraphrased version of the provided extract:

Proof:

When it is Alice's turn to start the game, she begins by coloring vertex r with the first color in the sequence used in the greedy coloring game. In response, Bob can color vertex t2 with the same color. This action ensures that vertices s and t cannot be assigned the first color. Next, Bob can strategically force either vertex t1 or t3 to be colored with the fourth color by coloring one of the two remaining uncolored vertices (that were originally colored first in the sequence) in his subsequent turn.

Alternatively, if Alice initiates the game by coloring vertex s with the first color, then none of the vertices in the set {r1, r2, r3, t1, t2, t3} can receive the first color. As a result, in the greedy game scenario, all the uncolored vertices (referred to as 'black' vertices in the original text) will be colored with the first color. This sequence of play ensures that all vertices in the aforementioned set can only be colored with either the second or third color. Furthermore, by strategically using the second and third colors in her next two turns, Alice can color both vertex r and vertex t, allowing her to win the game.
