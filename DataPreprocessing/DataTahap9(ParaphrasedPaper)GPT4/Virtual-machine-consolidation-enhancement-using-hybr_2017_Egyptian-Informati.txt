Cloud computing offers flexible scaling, reduces initial investment, and provides a pay-as-you-go model. Data centers in the cloud use substantial electricity, causing operational costs and CO2 emissions. This is not solely due to the amount of hardware but how it is used. Virtualization can improve energy efficiency by setting idle servers to low-power modes and using live migration to consolidate virtual machines (VMs) onto fewer hosts.

Current research typically uses CPU usage to guide VM migration, equating power use with CPU load. However, CPU-focused models are less accurate for network, I/O, or memory-intensive tasks. This study explores more efficient VM consolidation, selecting VMs for migration, and reviews related strategies. The authors discuss several algorithms for overload detection and VM selection, aiming for energy-efficient data center management.

They propose a Multiple Regression Host Overload Detection (MRHOD) algorithm that accounts for multiple factors and improves VM consolidation. The paper details various policies for selecting VMs for migration, including random selection and maximum correlation. It also reviews the literature on energy efficiency and VM management.

Two researchers, Beloglazov and Buyya, presented various strategies for VM consolidation based on historical data analysis. They used statistical methods for setting CPU utilization thresholds and developed a hybrid regression algorithm for future CPU use estimation.

Another proposal included a host overload detection algorithm based on mean, median, and standard deviation, combined with a fuzzy logic-based VM selection method. A fuzzy Markov model has also been developed for VM selection with different host and VM configurations, but this did not account for hybrid factors.

OpenStack Neat, an extension based on the OpenStack platform, provides a framework for dynamic VM consolidation. The authors' proposed MRHOD algorithm uses real-world power consumption data to simulate a data center environment, evaluating host overload at regular intervals and normalizing results against a base algorithm.

Their analysis shows that MRHOD and related algorithms conserve more energy, especially as the number of VMs increases. These algorithms reduce energy use by 20% compared to single-factor models, improving the Energy-SLA (Service Level Agreement) Violations metric by 24% or more.

They apply statistical tests to confirm the regression model's fit, indicating an adjusted R-square value of 0.91, demonstrating a close match with the data. The study concludes with a discussion on results, significance, and future research directions.
