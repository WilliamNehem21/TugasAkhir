Bootstrap aggregation, commonly known as bagging, is one of the most straightforward yet effective ensemble methods in machine learning. This technique, introduced by Breiman (1996), aims to reduce the variance of prediction models that exhibit instability over numerous iterations, particularly decision trees. Bagging accomplishes its goal by maintaining the bias of a single decision tree and mitigating the risk of overfitting. It operates by creating multiple sets of training data, constructing a model for each set, and then taking the average of predictions from these models to produce a more robust final output. The accuracy of predictions benefits from multiple instances of training data subsets compared to relying on a single decision tree (Talukdar and Pal, 2019).

In a different context, individuals living in areas with alkaline soils may face higher risks of zinc deficiency due to the inverse relationship between soil pH and zinc availability. Soil fertility is also influenced by factors such as its sulfur content, given that rapidly growing crops can absorb significant amounts of sulfur. Applying potassium to rice paddy soils can prevent a reduction in the soil's redox potential and support the soil as a nutrient reservoir, while also aiding in the repair of physiological damage through plant growth regulators (PGRs). The specificity of the interaction between management techniques and environmental factors, such as soil types and the degree of waterlogging, plays a crucial role. Generally, Kharif crops in India are grown under rainfed conditions with limited irrigation, though investments in irrigation infrastructure are necessary to support the cultivation of crops like Tulaipanji.
