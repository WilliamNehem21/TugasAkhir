In the absence of wind, the movement of a vehicle itself can create forces that cause the turbine blades to spin. These blades are affixed to a rotor, which is connected to a generator via a shaft, enabling the generation of electricity. The resulting electrical power is then utilized to either recharge the vehicle's batteries or to power its accessories.

Compared to alternative technologies, this system offers two primary benefits. Firstly, the system's aerodynamic profile is not compromised when it is not in use, as it can be closed or retracted. Secondly, the system is particularly efficient on downhill stretches where the kinetic energy of the vehicle is increased, enhancing the energy conversion process.

Furthermore, the paper discusses an innovative mechanism for turning the vertical movement from the vehicle's suspension into electrical energy. The interaction between the tires and the road surface results in a translational motion that can be harnessed. By incorporating a straightforward device, this linear movement can be transformed into rotational motion, which facilitates the production of electricity.
