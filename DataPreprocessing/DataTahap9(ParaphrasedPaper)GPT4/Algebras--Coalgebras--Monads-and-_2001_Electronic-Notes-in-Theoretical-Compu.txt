The paper begins with the presupposition that readers are familiar with the fundamental concepts of category theory as described in referenced materials. It mentions that to extend the theory beyond the Set category, the authors have to utilize specialized constructions, which may not be commonly known. A brief overview of these constructions is provided, but for a comprehensive explanation, the readers are referred to further literature.

The authors point out that when discussing the dual construction in Section 5, they encounter the concept of the limit of co-chains, which accessible endofunctors may not maintain. The consequence of this is that the rank of what they call the cofree comonad over an accessible endofunctor could increase, and this escalation of rank presents technical challenges which are covered in that section.

In addition, the paper discusses a construction that helps define terms of bounded depth, using an example where \( S_n \) denotes the terms of depth at most n. For instance, \( S_0(x) \) would contain variables \( x \), and \( S_1(x) \) would encompass variables \( x \), the canonical unit element of a monoid, and a product of elements from \( S_0(x) \).

It then reminds readers that adjunctions are core to categorical approaches in universal algebra. The process of dualization, which is a primary focus of the section, essentially involves substituting the left adjoint functor to \( U \) with a right adjoint, and replacing monads with comonads. The paper also notes that the resultant definition of a cosignature is formally identical to that of a signature.
