This academic paper offers a complete axiomatization of finite complete trace semantics for generative probabilistic transition systems using a coalgebraic approach. This methodology not only provides a framework for this specific system but also has the potential to axiomatize a variety of other system types. The paper highlights the utilization of determinization to establish soundness and completeness, noting that traces of coalgebraic systems can be effectively identified through this processâ€”an insight that is significant on its own.

The structure of the paper is as follows: Sections 2 and 3 lay the groundwork by introducing the fundamental concepts of coalgebras and coalgebraic trace semantics, along with details on probabilistic transition systems and their specific trace semantics. In Section 4, the authors detail the expressions' syntax relevant to quantitative transition systems. The pivotal contributions are presented in Section 5, where the main theorems regarding soundness and completeness of the axiomatization are discussed and verified. The paper concludes with final thoughts in Section 6 and includes a section with the proofs.

The core of the study asserts that by adding a single new axiom to the already sound and complete axiomatization regarding bisimilarity, the authors achieve a sound and complete axiomatization relative to trace semantics. Though the axioms are straightforward, proving their sufficiency for completeness is challenging. Before diving into the elaborate proof, an intuitive explanation is provided to ease understanding.

Drawing inspiration from Rabinovich's work, which provided an axiomatization of trace semantics for labeled transition systems (LTS), the authors adopt a similar calculus that is sound and complete with respect to bisimilarity and enhance it with an additional axiom. The coalgebraic nature of the approach means that the results and constructions are expressed in general terms, highlighting the critical conditions for the system's functor type and demonstrating potential generalizations.
