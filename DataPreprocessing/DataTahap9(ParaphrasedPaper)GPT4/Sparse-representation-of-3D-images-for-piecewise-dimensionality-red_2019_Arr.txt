The most commonly used multichannel images, such as true color images, can be represented more sparsely by treating them as 3D arrays using a highly redundant dictionary, rather than representing each channel independently or with constraints on color correlations. This approach significantly increases sparsity, especially with images that have more channels, like hyperspectral images.

This study highlights that using the Matching Pursuit (MP) method can result in selecting elements that are linearly dependent and may not give an optimal solution at each step. The Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) strategy addresses these issues, providing a superior method for selecting components. The 3D implementation of OMP presented in this work (OMP3D) is based on earlier work in 2D and extends the algorithm through adaptive biorthogonalization and Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization, similar to the one-dimensional approach.

Another method presented is the self-projected matching pursuit (SPMP), which can easily be extended to 3D (SPMP3D) thanks to its basis on inner product calculations. This method has previously been used with success in 2D with separable dictionaries.

The study approaches the approximation of images by dividing them into non-overlapping blocks, approximating each block separately, and then reassembling the blocks to form the complete image. This is tested within a MATLAB environment on a specific hardware configuration, using C++ MEX files to implement the OMP and SPMP methods.

The paper concludes that employing 3D approximation significantly enhances the sparsity of both RGB and hyperspectral images compared to traditional 2D channel-by-channel approximation. Particularly in the wavelet domain, hyperspectral images show even greater sparsity. However, for remote sensing images, the domain of approximation is less critical, as these images are not as sparse in the wavelet domain compared to natural images. This demonstration of improved sparsity points towards more efficient data reduction techniques for 3D images.
