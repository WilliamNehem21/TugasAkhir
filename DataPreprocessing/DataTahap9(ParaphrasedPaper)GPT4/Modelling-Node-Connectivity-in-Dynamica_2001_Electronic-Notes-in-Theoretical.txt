This paper discusses the connectivity variations in wide-area networks with dynamically evolving nodes, focusing on situations that deviate from the ideal but unrealistic scenario of uniform network connectivity. It describes two alternative and simplified forms of connection that reflect more common user experiences.

In "untethered mode," mobile users intermittently connect to different network areas with restricted connectivity, such as those within a firewall. Some of these computers may act as gateways, allowing access to the broader internet despite restrictions.

The paper is structured to present the programming language KLAIM (Kernel Language for Agent Interaction and Mobility), an experimental language designed for programming distributed systems with interactive components, mobile code, and multiple tuple spaces. KLAIM is based on the coordination language LINDA, which operates on the concept of a tuple spaceâ€”a collection of tuples that are sequences of various types of data fields.

KLAIM expands on LINDA by introducing multiple, distributed tuple spaces located on different nodes and addresses the mobility of code and processes. Each node in a KLAIM network has a tuple space and can perform operations to add or remove tuples, with processes built using standard operators from process algebra.

Furthermore, KLAIM has 'superprocesses' that can manipulate network topology and are installed at nodes either initially or dynamically. These superprocesses represent an abstraction of the network's operating system, while standard KLAIM processes represent user programs.

The paper also discusses a specific scenario with a software engineer working in isolation, occasionally connecting to a virtual community server for updates and communication with other users. The engineer's node alternates between being connected (online) and disconnected (offline) from the virtual community's cluster.

Furthermore, the paper touches on implementation aspects, suggesting that clusters can be integrated into the existing KLAIM implementation. Clusters are compared to servers, and nodes can register with multiple servers within a network.

Lastly, it positions KLAIM in relation to two other paradigms: the Ambient Calculus and LIME. Unlike clusters in KLAIM, the Ambient Calculus considers physical environments and allows nesting and movement, whereas LIME represents mobile agents with individual tuple spaces that share a transient tuple space at the host.
