The academic paper discusses the challenges in applying formalisms to the study of concurrency within nominal calculi. While graphical representations to handle these calculi have been utilized, creating a concurrent semantics for graph rewriting that aligns with the DPO (Double PushOut) approach presents difficulties. In particular, the matchings between the left-hand side of a rewriting rule and the target graph are required to be injective (one-to-one) mappings, but the transformations indicated by the right-hand side are often defined by non-injective morphisms, which means they merge nodes in the graph. These constraints hinder the development of a concurrent semantics that satisfactorily represents the partial ordering of rewrites. 

Despite these issues, the problems are significant enough to warrant further investigation. The paper then discusses the definition of rewriting systems on e-graphs using the DPO framework. For practical reasons, the paper suggests working with typed e-graphs, in which the e-graphs are labeled over a structure similar to another e-graphâ€”a concept borrowed from graph typing literature.

The paper goes on to describe certain rules (r1 to r6) that define communication within restricted processes. For example, rule (r2) illustrates a process where communication via a channel results in a name being globally communicated and substituted across all occurrences within the residual process. Rule (r3) states that a name should not be bound if no substitution occurs, while rule (r4) eliminates correct matches from consideration. Lastly, rules (r5) and (r6) affirm that the reduction relation is closed with respect to restriction and parallel composition, meaning that this relation remains consistent when processes are restricted or composed in parallel.
