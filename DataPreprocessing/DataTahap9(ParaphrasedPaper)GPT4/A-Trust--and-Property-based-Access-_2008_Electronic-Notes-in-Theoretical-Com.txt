In open and distributed environments where access control is determined by property-based rights, granting access is based not merely on a set of certified properties but also on the relationships and trust dynamics between the agents involved. This study aims to highlight the importance of these relationships and trust considerations and to integrate them explicitly into the access-control decision-making process.

To approach the complexities of trust, this work suggests a nuanced perspective over a simple global property scheme. Agents determine trustworthiness with regards to the entities that certify the properties. Each agent's access control policy is a reflection of their local trust evaluations, influenced by both local and system-wide factors. Additionally, the model addresses the potential need to revoke properties, the ability to enforce explicit access prohibitions, and the expression of trust or distrust in other agents.

The research also emphasizes the necessity of addressing doubt and distrust. Bound properties are redefined such that if an owner trusts another agent, they grant a positive access right as a bound property. Conversely, distrust results in a negative access right, and this does not negate previously granted positive rights. Instead, in the case of doubt, an owner may withdraw a previously granted bound property.

Trust evaluations are driven by participant expectations: if a participant expects that a property will be certified honestly by the grantor, the participant assigns trust to the grantor-property pairing. On the contrary, if expectations are negative, the participant assigns distrust, and if uncertain, the participant remains neutral, aligning with doubt. Overall, the model aims to move beyond simple binary trust evaluations to accommodate the intricate nature of trust in access control systems.
