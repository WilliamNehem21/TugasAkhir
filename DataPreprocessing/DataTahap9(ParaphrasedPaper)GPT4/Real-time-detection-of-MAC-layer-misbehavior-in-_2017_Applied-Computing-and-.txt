The paper discusses the significant benefit of fair access to the communication medium provided by the IEEE 802.11 standard, while also acknowledging the security challenges it faces, such as jamming, black holes, and particularly greedy behavior at the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer.

The structure of the paper is as follows: The second section outlines the IEEE 802.11 architecture, including its various layers. The third section reviews existing research on MAC layer misbehavior in the IEEE 802.11 context. In the fourth section, the authors introduce their detection method for identifying greedy behavior in the MAC layer. The fifth section assesses the performance of the proposed detection scheme using the Network Simulator 2 (ns2). The paper concludes with a final section that highlights the conclusions and future research directions.

The paper explains the IEEE 802.11 MAC layer's operating procedure, which employs Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA). A node checks the channel for activity before sending data, and if the channel has been idle for a set time defined by a Distributed Coordination Function Interframe Space (DIFS), it proceeds to transmit a frame. This frame is then acknowledged after a Short Interframe Space (SIFS) interval.

The paper mentions other research that suggests an improvement to the standard in the form of uniformly distributed random backoff times, achieved via a public exchange modeled on a coin-flip via telephone protocol. However, this doesn't address collision detections between sender and receiver.

The authors propose a model for detecting MAC layer misbehavior, particularly by greedy nodes that manipulate their backoff timers within a network of ‘n’ nodes that includes ‘l’ greedy nodes. The detection system implemented at each station identifies the greedy node by monitoring average reception throughput and mean inter-packet times using control charts. This process is automatic and aims to distinguish between cheating and non-cheating nodes.

The detection scheme's thresholds and tolerance intervals vary depending on the number of active nodes, and therefore, each receiving node adjusts these parameters accordingly. The authors' tests of the detection scheme in an ideal environment with constant bit rate traffic show that statistical process control is an effective method for monitoring and detecting significant deviations from normal behavior in both realistic and theoretical scenarios. The goal is to discern between normal and abnormal situations.
