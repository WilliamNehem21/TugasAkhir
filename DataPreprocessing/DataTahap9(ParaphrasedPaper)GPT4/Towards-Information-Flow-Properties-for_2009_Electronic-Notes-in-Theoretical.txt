The paper presents an academic investigation into distributed systems and related context theory and modeling. It is structured as follows:

Section 2 reviews basic concepts in context theory and explores the application of context in the modeling of distributed systems.

Section 3 introduces a framework designed for detailing information flow properties within a distributed system.

Section 4 compares the proposed work with existing literature.

Section 5 summarizes the conclusions drawn from the study.

Supporting proof of key theorems is provided in the appendix.

The paper outlines a comprehensive framework that accommodates complex scenarios in partially specified systems, examining cases from a single unspecified component to multiple such components. Various approaches for systems with multiple 'holes' or unspecified areas include considering all gaps as a single entity or treating them as multiple independent processes.

Notably, the paper discusses the nuances in behavior between a composite context and individual contexts during process actions, which becomes pivotal to one of the paper's main claims.

Moreover, the paper seeks to broaden the definitions of nondeducibility on composition (NDC) and the stronger balanced NDC (BNDC) beyond individual processes to distributed systems, modeling these systems as contexts and questioning their NDC/BNDC properties. The authors note that BNDC is not compositional with respect to the parallel operator, echoing findings from previous research, which also suggested more robust properties for ensuring compositionality.

Finally, the paper indicates an extension of this research to incorporate a verification method for the BNDC property in centralized and distributed systems, factoring in the potential for unspecified components to engage in both innocuous ('low') and significant ('high') actions, acknowledging that these components might not only pose security threats but also act as typical processes.
