This paper presents a graph-based calculus for multi-modal logics that is both sound and complete, effectively embedding Kripke semantics within its framework. This calculus offers a standardized set of tools for formulating and processing modal formulas and adapts naturally to various modalities, including global and difference modalities. It also suggests how this framework can easily incorporate other normal modal logics, like T, S4, S5, and more. 

The paper is structured to first introduce the conceptual foundation of the graph approach to modal logic. It then defines the graph language used for modal logic in terms of syntax, semantics, and constructs. The main focus, presented in section 4, is on the graph calculus itself, which includes rules for conversion and expansion, and a discussion on its validity. Section 5 explores extensions of the graph calculus to accommodate additional modalities and modal properties like reflexivity, symmetry, transitivity, and determinism. The paper concludes by summarizing the discussion.

An example is provided where a graph slice S showcases a conflicting situation through contradictory arcs at one node, indicating competing assertions. However, the paper suggests that by mapping elements from another draft (T) to the graph of S, one can draw parallels and resolve these conflicts.

The authors assert that this graph approach to multi-modal logics is not only accurate but captures the essence of modal semantics. The systematic method lends itself to easily graspable extensions by embodying the intuitive aspects of the expanded modalities.

In section 2, examples are used to illustrate that finite counter-models exist, although finite models cannot be guaranteed by the construction outlined. Nonetheless, the authors believe that it might be possible to adapt the filtration method to this new approach to generate finite models. They also speculate that key modal logic concepts, like bi-simulation, might find analogues in this graph framework.
