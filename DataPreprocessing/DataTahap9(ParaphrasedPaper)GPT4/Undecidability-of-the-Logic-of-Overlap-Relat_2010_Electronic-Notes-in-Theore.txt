The academic paper discusses the decidability of certain fragments of interval temporal logics, specifically those related to modalities and their interpretation over different types of linear orderings. The focus of the paper is to assess whether it's possible to determine, with a yes or no answer, whether a given statement in these logics is true, depending on the structure of time they describe.

The paper begins by mentioning that several fragments involving single modalities have already been proven to have the decidability property, with different techniques leading to the conclusion that some of these logics have a small model property. This means that if a formula is true, it is true in some small, finite model. Specifically, the decidability of the modalities B, B, E, E has been shown via reduction to point-based logics, and the modalities A, A, L, L have been shown to be decidable in previous work.

The central contribution of this paper is the discovery that the logic labeled O, which is interpreted over discrete linear orderings and possesses limited expressiveness and simplicity, is actually undecidable. In contrast to the other modalities mentioned, O is an exception to the trend of decidability.

The proof of the undecidability of O relies on a reduction from the problem of octant tiling – a known undecidable problem – which involves tiling a quadrant of the integer plane following specific adjacency color rules, to questions about the truth of O logic over discrete linear orderings.

The structure of the paper is then outlined, with sections dedicated to the syntax and semantics of the O fragment (Section 2), the structure of the undecidability proof (Section 3), a detailed account of the proof (Section 4), and a conclusion which discusses the implications of the work and suggests directions for future research.

The proof's strategy is also given an intuitive explanation, with references to how the proof strategy for O differs from previous undecidability proofs due to the overlap modality's nature.

The paper concludes by mentioning that the undecidability proof for O probably does not transfer to other classes of linear orderings, such as dense linear orderings, and expresses interest in solving the decision problem for the logic when interpreted over such other orderings. Finally, the authors note that they are not aware of any temporal logic whose decidability status changes when interpreted over different classes of linear orderings.
