The study examines a plant disease that manifests as white spots on leaves, beginning as small dots and eventually expanding to cover the entire leaf surface. This leads to a loss of chlorophyll and impairs photosynthesis. Severe cases exhibit mottling symptoms that can be mistaken for cassava mosaic disease, causing leaves to dry, shrink, and detach from the plant.

Whiteflies, which serve as vectors, transmit the disease, leading to yellowing of veins on leaves that can expand into larger yellow areas. There are also symptoms of dark-brown necrotic spots on tuber roots, along with a decrease in root size.

Foliage symptoms include mottling, mosaic, and deformed leaves, which result in smaller leaf sizes and stunted plant growth due to the reduced area available for photosynthesis, thereby lowering yields.

The main issue with the study's dataset was its small size, which could cause overfitting. The data was also unbalanced with an overrepresentation of certain disease classes and suffered from poor image quality, resolution, and contrast. To address these issues, the researchers employed deep learning techniques such as assigning class weights, implementing focal loss as a loss function to address extreme class imbalance, and utilizing SMOTE to resample the minority class, all of which are explained in section 4.3.

The study highlights the danger of deploying a model with high accuracy that has been trained on a skewed dataset, noting that real-world performance could be severely compromised due to class imbalance. To combat this, the researchers used a combination of established techniques including class weight adjustment, focal loss, and SMOTE, along with data augmentation to expand the training set size.

The convolutional neural networks (CNNs) developed for this study were trained on a limited, highly imbalanced dataset with an overrepresentation of cassava mosaic disease (CMD) and cassava brown streak disease (CBSD) cases. The researchers innovated by training CNNs from scratch using such a dataset, applying techniques like class weight adjustment, focal loss, and SMOTE, with various image resolutions. The best results were achieved using image inputs sized at 448x448 pixels with three color channels.

The performance of the model on the imbalanced dataset was notably enhanced by these techniques. The adjusted model outperformed previous iterations by achieving over 5% higher accuracy and significant reductions in log loss. Incorporating the model into mobile applications could help farmers and agricultural workers utilize smartphones or other devices for timely detection of cassava diseases.

Future research should focus on identifying plants affected by multiple diseases simultaneously, which remains a challenge.
