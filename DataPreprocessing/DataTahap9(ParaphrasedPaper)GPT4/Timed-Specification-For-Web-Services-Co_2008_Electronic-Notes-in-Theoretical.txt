The paper discusses the challenges in ensuring interoperability among web services, emphasizing the importance of compatibility analysis in service composition, and offers an approach for automatic compatibility checking. 

The main focus of the paper is:

1. Describing a model (in Section 2) for analyzing web service compatibility.
2. Presenting an example (in Section 3) to demonstrate the model.
3. Defining various types of temporal constraints (in Section 4) affecting web services.
4. Extending Web Services Timed Transition Systems (WSTTS) to integrate temporal constraints (in Section 5).
5. Detailing the process for compatibility analysis considering both data and temporal constraints (in Section 6).
6. Discussing related work in the field (in Section 7).
7. Concluding remarks (in Section 8).

The authors introduce the notion of external constraints as conditions that need to be satisfied for an interaction between a client and a provider to begin. These constraints can pertain to the timing (when an operation can occur) and the data involved (what conditions must be met for a message to be sent or received). 

Internal constraints are described as being either temporal (pertaining to local or global clocks) or related to data (e.g., message parameters or counters). Temporal constraints may concern clocks that track either relative time (local clocks) or absolute time (global clock). Data-related constraints could involve conditions on message parameters or manipulation of counters (incrementing, decrementing, or resetting their values).

Compatibility between two web services is defined as the ability for messages sent by one service to be properly received by another, considering the data and temporal constraints. The authors describe consistency of transitions between input and output messages, categorizing them into absolute consistency, likely consistency, or absolute inconsistency based on how well the temporal constraints align between the sending and receiving periods of messages.

Furthermore, the paper contrasts its approach to previous work dealing with the analysis and verification of properties in composite web services, including those specified by Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) processes and analyzed with Linear Temporal Logic (LTL).

In conclusion, the paper proposes a method to analyze and ensure compatibility between web services by taking into account operational details, messaging patterns, associated data, and temporal constraints. The authors discuss internal constraints that regulate a service's behavior and external constraints that are derived from the internal ones, noting that these can reveal implicit conditions that may lead to incompatibility. The paper ends by extending the concept of WSTTS to facilitate the compatibility analysis of web services.
