The academic paper discusses the complexity of finding the hull number—a measure associated with graphs—in undirected and oriented/ directed graph contexts. It reaffirms the existing knowledge that determining the hull number in undirected graphs is an NP-hard problem, even for bipartite graphs. Additionally, it suggests that the NP-hardness carries over to the oriented case when considering arcs in both directions.

The paper introduces an approximation by replacing each edge of a bipartite graph with an oriented 4-cycle (C4) to simulate a similar situation in the oriented case. This technique maintains the complexity of the original problem within the class of bipartite graphs.

It highlights that any hull set (a set of vertices that "convexifies" the entire graph) must intersect with any co-convex set and must include at least one vertex from each "unsatisfactory" cycle.

The researchers then provide insights into the composed of a hull set in an oriented cactus graph. Upon considering a vertex v and a maximal directed path containing v, they identify three scenarios where the path terminates: at an extreme vertex, a trap cycle, or an unsatisfactory cycle of type 2. In each scenario, the termination vertex should belong to any hull set.

Theorem 4.5 states that for any oriented cactus graph, a minimum hull set consists of all extreme vertices plus one non-extreme vertex from each unsatisfactory cycle, and this set should also include all vertices not part of a satisfactory cycle.

The paper also addresses "Type 1" unsatisfactory cycles, where there are unique entry and exit points (a source u1 and a sink u2), and the internal paths connecting these points have different lengths. It mentions that one of the internal vertices on the longest path is a cut-vertex.

This paper suggests that while similar results existed for undirected graphs, this research explores and affirms their equivalent for oriented graphs. It points out that determining the hull number (HN) and geodetic number (GN) remains NP-hard for chordal graphs, introducing an open problem of investigating the complexity of these numbers within chordal graphs.
