This research paper addresses the challenges faced by deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals in Egyptian society, where there are more than 3 million people with disabling hearing loss, and the majority struggle with reading and writing standard Arabic. These individuals rely primarily on Arabic Sign Language (ARSL) for communication, which is not comprehensively supported or understood by the hearing population. This linguistic isolation exacerbates their social and economic marginalization, as they have limited ways to engage with the broader community and access information or services.

Government support for the deaf in the Arabic region, particularly in Egypt, is minimal, with insufficient ARSL interpretation services provided in the media or for legislative documents. Assistive technologies for the deaf are also lacking, partly due to the complexity of both the Arabic language and ARSL. These challenges call for improved technological solutions that could facilitate better communication and inclusion for the deaf community.

This paper specifically explores the development of an automatic machine-based interpreter to facilitate communication between deaf individuals who use ARSL and those who do not. The focus is on converting Arabic speech to ARSL. The researchers used a database to create a system evaluated by five users, showing high usability but also notable limitations, such as storage constraints on mobile devices and the maximum length for translated text.

The proposed system includes a service layer for core processing functions, which can transform spoken Arabic into ARSL or translate text in images into ARSL by first extracting the text to be translated. Microsoft's Advanced Technology Lab in Cairo provided the Arabic Toolkit Service (ATKS), a suite of natural language processing tools designed for Arabic, including a spell-checker, morphological analyzer, diacritizer, named entity recognizer, colloquial text converter, and part-of-speech tagger. These tools support the system's text preprocessing steps, especially the conversion of Egyptian colloquial text to standard Arabic, improving the translation process's efficiency and accuracy.

The paper highlights the system's application through a practical scenario: a deaf person, struggling to distinguish between three similar buildings, uses the program to scan and translate building titles into ARSL, successfully identifying the correct location. This example underscores the potential impact such technologies could have in fostering greater accessibility and independence for the deaf community within Arabic-speaking regions.
