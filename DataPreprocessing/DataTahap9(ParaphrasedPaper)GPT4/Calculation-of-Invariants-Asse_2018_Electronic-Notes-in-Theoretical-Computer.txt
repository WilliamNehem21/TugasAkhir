To paraphrase the given text while maintaining the academic tone:

Questions (i) and (ii) are addressed using Theorem 3.1 and Corollary 3.3, which are applicable to loops whose actions may be non-deterministic but exhibit deterministic behavior for the variables involved in the loop's condition. Questions (iii) and (iv) are tackled through a method that leverages mathematical induction, which is suitable for loops of a specific structure.

Proof: As this theorem concerns a formula with instances that are also formulas, a formal predicate derivation system is utilized to guarantee accuracy. It is essential for readers to interpret the ensuing proof as a set of proofs, with each one corresponding to a particular instantiation of the predicates 'inv,' 'nbg,' and 'dombg.' This outcome is achieved by sequentially applying the derivations as listed. The inference rules employed here are derived from the calculative logic as introduced in Gries's book.

For readers interested in a more detailed understanding of the techniques referenced, they can consult the works of Kovacs and Jebelean. These authors elaborate on the automated creation of loop invariants through recurrence solving and the generation of invariants for loops containing conditional statements in their published papers from the International Symposium on Symbolic and Numeric Algorithms for Scientific Computing (SYNASC) and the Computer-Aided Verification on Information Systems Workshop (CAVIS).
