The academic paper discusses an inverse problem to the well-studied issue of determining the time separation between two events, which is known to be NP-complete. The inverse problem involves finding ranges for component delays to ensure the time difference between events i and j is below a set limit. The authors present a method that solves this problem in polynomial time and describe its utility in relaxing individual component delay bounds while maintaining the overall required time separation between events i and j.

Despite the complexity of the direct problem, the paper focuses on producing exact maximum time separations for a limited set of component delays, rather than approximate solutions that are obtained through polynomial-time algorithms proposed by previous research. The paper contrasts its approach with others that use parameter-based techniques and exponential-time processes, such as Fourier-Motzkin elimination or methods based on Presburger arithmetic, to find precise solutions.

The authors caution that an enhanced version of their method loses polynomial-time complexity due to the involvement of minimum and maximum constraints that make the system unsatisfiable in exponential time for a larger number of events. Nevertheless, even with its increased complexity, the authors argue this enhancement is still practically helpful.
