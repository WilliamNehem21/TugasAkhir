This academic paper discusses the implementation of a large-scale application, a conference reviewing system, using Mobile Maudeâ€”a language extension of Maude that facilitates mobile computation. The system is presented as a case study to demonstrate the utility and features of Mobile Maude in handling complex distributed tasks. The authors argue that providing complete and practical examples is an effective way to introduce new languages like Mobile Maude.

With the rise of the internet, the focus on developing distributed applications has significantly increased, emphasizing the need for technologies that streamline the design, implementation, and maintenance of these systems. Mobile code and mobile agent technologies emerge as promising solutions for creating robust and fault-tolerant systems that can reduce network traffic and overcome latency.

The paper is structured into sections covering the description of Mobile Maude, the implementation of the conference reviewing system, an analysis of related work, and final conclusions with thoughts on future research directions.

Communication in Mobile Maude happens through messaging, which varies based on the location of the objects. Inside the same mobile object, messaging can be synchronous or asynchronous. Between different mobile objects, the communication is always asynchronous, irrespective of whether they reside in the same or different processes.

To depict the conference reviewing system, the paper highlights roles such as the program chair and committee members, and their interactions such as paper submissions, reviews, and decision-making. The entire system's flow is explained, including message encryption assumptions, object attributes, states, and operations.

Complex behaviors like migration, task delegation, review tracking, and state transitions are also discussed, showcasing Mobile Maude's capabilities in orchestrating these processes. 

In the case of conflicting reviews, the paper details the strategy employed to resolve disagreements through iterative review rounds led by the program chair, who makes final decisions when necessary. Accepted papers are then collected for conference proceedings, and authors are notified through the system.

Lastly, the paper makes a comparison with related work, citing another approach that uses an active document concept within a web-based architectural framework for autonomous agents. This underscores the relevance of Mobile Maude in the context of contemporary technologies and distributed systems design.
