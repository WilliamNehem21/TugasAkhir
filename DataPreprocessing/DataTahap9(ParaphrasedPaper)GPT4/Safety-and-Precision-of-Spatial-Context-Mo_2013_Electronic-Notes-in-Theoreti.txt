This paper discusses a formal approach to evaluating the accuracy of navigational maps used by mobile autonomous vehicles in relation to the real-world environments they represent. The authors focus on calculating a distance metric that compares the derived navigational paths to those of an ideal map, taking into account false-positive paths (collision-free on the map but not in reality) and false-negative paths (collision-free in reality but deemed unsafe on the map).

The authors posit that their formalism, which uses partial order relations, provides a unifying framework for various map scoring methods. This framework allows them to categorize environments into safe or unsafe deviations from the ground truth. They introduce the concept of e-correct environments, which are indistinguishable from the true environment based on the sensory perception available, and e-imprecise environments, which are safely imprecise representations of the true environment.

The work emphasizes the utility of occupancy grids in mobile robotics, which serve as a spatial context for tasks such as map building, localization, sensor fusion, path planning, and obstacle avoidance.

The paper also proposes a means of representing sensor data using abstract lattices and probabilistic readings to create a more generalized framework for evaluating environmental representations. It demonstrates how the abstraction and concretization functions within this lattice framework allow for a thorough assessment of safety considerations.

In summary, by modeling sensory perception within a formal mathematical structure, the paper argues for a rigorous framework that can make explicit the safety implications for mobile autonomous systems, helping to ensure that these systems navigate safely within their environments.
