In order to analyze the underlying syntax of VS COBOL II effectively, it is necessary to convert the syntax diagrams into a structured grammar format. This is accomplished by employing an Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF) within the Grammar Recovery Kit (GRK). GRK incorporates both a concrete syntax for EBNF and a term-based representation.

The GRK accounts for newline characters (NL) in the EBNF to retain the format and alignment of the original syntax diagrams, crucial for accurately regenerating the layout. However, improvements are needed in GRK as it currently does not maintain certain specifics, such as IBM-specific notations.

The current GRK uses a generic replacement method without thorough checks to differentiate between language constraints, generalizations, and arbitrary replacements. Future work includes incorporating more robust mechanisms from referenced literature to better manage these distinctions.

The grammar extracted from the re-engineered IBM documentation is not directly used for generating parsers or exporting to the Grammar Development Kit (GDK). To prepare for grammar deployment, an additional 158 Finite State Transducer (FST) transformations are applied. These transformations address issues such as ambiguities and overly complex productions for EBNF. They also remove permutations that are incompatible with common parsing technologies and adjust the grammar to fit the limited backtracking model used in the execution of the generated DCG parser. Once the DCG-specific adjustments are made, the final grammar is exported to GDK, which then produces a working BTYACC parser.

Although grammar inference can be effective in various application areas, attempts to infer grammars for programming languages have been restricted in scope. Furthermore, it's believed that grammar transformations play a critical role in (i) repurposing existing grammar knowledge, (ii) formalizing tacit grammar knowledge, and (iii) tracking the progression of grammars. The intent is to refine these methods by incorporating inference concepts into the process.

Acknowledgment is given to colleagues for the collaborative efforts in treating grammars as engineering entities, contributing to the broader discipline of grammarware engineering. Special thanks to Jan Kort for his role, and appreciation is extended to Paul Klint, Steven Klusener, Chris Verhoef, and others with similar interests in the field, with an apology for any potential oversights in acknowledging contributors.
