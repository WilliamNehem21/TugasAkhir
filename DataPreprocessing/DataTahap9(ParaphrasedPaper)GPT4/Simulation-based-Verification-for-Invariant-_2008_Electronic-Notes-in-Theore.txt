The OTS/CafeOBJ approach is a formal technique used to create system models, define these models, and ensure they meet certain required properties. This paper introduces a strategy for validating if a given state machine, S, adheres to invariant properties through comparison with a more abstract state machine using the OTS/CafeOBJ method. The paper showcases this verification process through the example of three communication protocols.

The development of the OTS/CafeOBJ method, as cited in several references, relies heavily on inductive reasoning over the state space reachable by state machines to confirm invariance. The method described here is termed as induction-based (invariant) verification. In the context of the OTS/CafeOBJ method, Observational Transition Systems (OTSs) function as state machines, and CafeOBJ, a formal specification language and tool, is employed to express OTSs and verify their properties. Various case studies have been carried out to demonstrate this methodology.

The paper's structure unfolds with a description of OTSs, an introduction to CafeOBJ, and then proceeds to define simulations between OTSs. Following this, a method for simulation-based invariant verification is proposed and compositions of simulations are explained. It also surveys related work and concludes with a comparison between the OTS/CafeOBJ method and other formal methods, such as I/O automata, Z, B, VDM, and Event-B in the context of events and their execution conditions. The conditions for transitions within the OTS/CafeOBJ method are likened to guards rather than preconditions but aren't identical, as transitions can occur in any state, even if effective conditions aren't met, though the state remains unchanged in such a scenario.
