A variety of methods have been investigated in the field of flow analysis to determine the boundaries of loops in computational processes, with several key references noted[2,1,7,11,14,5]. Many of these methods apply the concept of abstract interpretation, which creates a mapping that assigns an abstract approximation to the value of each variable. This technique allows the establishment of sets of possible states at various points within a program, which are guaranteed to be inclusive but might exceed the exact limits.

In the context of loop analysis, when q1 equals 0, and if a particular assignment to the variable x leads to the termination of the loop, then the formula x= q2x+ k20 represents the standard growth rate of x. If during the execution the first condition branch is taken and it causes the loop's exit condition to be met in the following iteration, then this implies the loop will have reached its maximum iterations if the second branch is always chosen. If the exit condition is not met, the loop might potentially run indefinitely. However, in the special scenario where q2 equals 0 and this denotes the final loop iteration, x is updated according to the equation x= q1x+ k10. If the result of this operation is not defined, the ultimate behavior of the loop remains undetermined.
