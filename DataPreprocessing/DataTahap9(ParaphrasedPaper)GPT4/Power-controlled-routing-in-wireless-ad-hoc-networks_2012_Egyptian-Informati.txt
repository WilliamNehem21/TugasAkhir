This academic paper introduces a novel routing approach for wireless ad hoc networks that incorporates power control into the routing protocolâ€”a topic that has attracted significant research attention. The primary contributions of this work are the reduction of energy consumption in the network, improvement of network throughput, and enhancements in packet delivery ratio, among other performance metrics. The authors propose a new on-demand routing algorithm called Power Control Ad Hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (PC-AODV). This algorithm creates routing paths based on node power levels as needed and chooses routes that use the least power for data transmission. It also adjusts power levels for sending both data packets and MAC layer control packets through distinct power control policies. Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of PC-AODV in decreasing average communication energy use, thereby extending the network's lifespan, and in improving both the packet delivery ratio and average end-to-end delay.

The paper also touches on the complexity of power control, referring to a simplification by Kirousis et al., who framed power control as a problem of assigning transmission ranges and analyzed its computational complexity. They introduce a system where power levels are assigned to different modes of node communication, including the minimum power required and specific levels for transmitting data packets and control packets in both network and MAC layers. Overall, the paper argues that embedding power control within routing protocols is an essential evolution for ad hoc network performance enhancement.
