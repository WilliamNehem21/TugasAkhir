During the initial phase of operation, an induction motor draws significantly higher current than it does under regular functioning, typically about five to six times greater. This elevated current level persists until the motor achieves its standard operating speed, a process that can span from a few seconds to approximately one minute. As a consequence of this increased current demand, there is a reduction in voltage, referred to as voltage sag.
