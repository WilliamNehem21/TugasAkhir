This paper explores advancements in understanding cell-to-cell relationships with a focus on two complex scenarios. The first scenario deals with varying numbers of cells at different time points, which might necessitate the same cell being involved in multiple lineages. The second scenario acknowledges that cells can have differing proliferation rates at the same time point, leading to uneven groups of cells over time. The authors have extended their methodologies to address these complexities and provide further details along with experimental results in supplementary materials.

The paper discusses simulation datasets at distinct time points, each containing five identical cell types but varying in cell quantity (200-600 cells) and gene count (100-500 genes per cell). Cell alignments and cell-to-cell connections are derived using the cellST method based on gene expression data alone, without relying on other cellular information.

The researchers compare expression patterns in cell fate trajectories against benchmark pathway patterns and observe that while there is consistency, individual cell behavior varies over time. Some cells grow slower with lower expression values, while others grow faster with higher expression values than the average simulated development patterns. These trajectories capture this unique behavior and assist in reducing variability between cells.

The cellST method's capacity to identify key genes during cell differentiation is highlighted by the consistency of cell fate trajectories and dynamic gene networks, even including coverage of rare cell types. These trajectories convey individual gene expression patterns as cells mature into different specialized types.

Finally, the paper references several influential studies that have enhanced the understanding of cell dynamics and fate decisions through pseudotemporal ordering and the impact of material properties, such as stiffness in hydrogel-based bioinks, on cell differentiation in three-dimensional bioprinted matrices.
