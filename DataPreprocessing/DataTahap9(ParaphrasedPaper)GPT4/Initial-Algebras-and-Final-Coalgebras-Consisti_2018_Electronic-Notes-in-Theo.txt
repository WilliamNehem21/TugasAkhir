In order to describe what can be defined, we remove the requirements for something to be entirely and entirely based on a well-ordered foundation. Hence, a strategy can be defined with a command that has finite non-determinism if and only if the strategy is based on a finite foundation. Furthermore, a strategy can be defined with a command that exhibits countable non-determinism if and only if the strategy itself is countably non-deterministic.
