This study focuses on the application of image processing and machine learning (ML) techniques for the real-time recognition of dragon fruit diseases. Researchers preprocessed dragon fruit images, segmented them, and extracted thirteen features. They employed two feature ranking methods, ANOVA and LASSO, to select the most relevant features. Six machine learning algorithms — decision tree, random forest, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), AdaBoost, logistic regression, and support vector machine (SVM) — were then applied to the best features. These classifiers were assessed using seven performance metrics to determine their effectiveness in disease recognition. The paper compares two feature selection methods and calculates the computational cost to understand the impact of selected features.

The paper is structured into five sections: an introduction, literature review, method and materials, results with comparative analysis and validation, and conclusions, limitations, and future research. The literature review highlights relevant studies on fruit and plant disease recognition using machine learning. For example, Hakim et al. classified dragon fruit by appearance, while Doh et al. and others presented techniques for citrus and papaya disease identification, respectively, utilizing various ML classifiers with significant success rates.

In their own method, the researchers extracted 13 features and used feature selection to reduce redundancy, retaining the top 10 features for the study. They split their data into 60% for training, 20% for validation, and 20% for testing, using the training data to fit models and the validation and test data to evaluate performance.

Their results showed that different ML classifiers had varying success rates, with the performance of the LASSO feature selection method surpassing that of ANOVA. To promote transparency and reproducibility, the dataset used in this research is accessible on GitHub. The study's primary contribution is in enhancing the recognition of dragon fruit diseases, which can aid in minimizing losses for those cultivating this increasingly popular fruit.
