Modern organizations grapple with the challenge of integrating cutting-edge technologies while also ensuring the security of systems and data critical to their operations. Despite improvements in security measures, breaches remain a concern. The severity of cyber-attacks is prompting a shift towards a "Zero Trust" model, which removes the assumption of a safe internal network. Zero Trust increases attackers' difficulty but adds complexity in managing security policies, which involves continuous system-wide data collection and policy enforcement in varying contexts.

The need for innovation, driven by advancements like IoT, machine learning, and cloud computing, forces businesses to connect these innovations to their networks or else fall behind competitors. This connectivity further strains the capabilities of security teams.

The study of human behavior in cybersecurity reveals issues with usability. Users often disregard warnings, underestimate risks, or have desensitized reactions due to false alarms. Interface design and cognitive biases can adversely affect security decisions, influenced by users' backgrounds and beliefs.

Our framework uses formal methods to generate user-specific security policies by first identifying expected security behaviors through literature. These behaviors are then formally modeled to support automated reasoning, revealing user behavior weaknesses and informing suitable policies.

The framework encompasses various abstraction levels to maintain clarity and manageability. It consists of multiple layers, focusing on different security services and categorizing the complexity of employed security aspects within specific dimensions.

The highest abstract layer, Layer 1, incorporates core security tasks such as device securement and password management, based on established academic principles.

Initial experiments involved modeling selected security behaviors as timed automata. The models tested behavior classification and subsequently informed the granting of permissions ranging from strict to lenient based on whether behaviors were deemed good or bad.

This methodology provides a structure for formally verifying the presence of good or bad security behaviors and creating relevant user-specific policies. maneuverity of modeled behaviors are categorized using academic instruments, allowing distinction between effective and ineffective security choices.

Finally, user behavior is modeled through finite-state automata for various test cases, with resulting data dictating the appropriateness of user-specific security permissions. This process delineates clear security behavior standards while driving policy recommendations.
