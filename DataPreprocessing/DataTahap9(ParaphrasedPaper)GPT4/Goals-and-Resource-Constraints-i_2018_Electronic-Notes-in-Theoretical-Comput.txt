Collective Adaptive Systems (CAS) appear in many forms in nature, such as insect swarms and the spread of diseases in human populations. These systems consist of numerous simple elements, called agents, each with limited individual perception but capable of interacting with nearby peers. The interactions between these localized agents can lead to complex and unpredictable behaviors at the larger system scale.

The paper is structured with the following sections:

2. Introduction of Carma process algebra.
3. Description of an extension for specifying individual resource constraints and overall system goals.
4. An example of the extensions using a swarm robot model.
5. Presentation of a software tool developed for these alterations.
6. Conclusion.

Carma is a novel stochastic process algebra tailored for modeling CAS, featuring a comprehensive range of communication primitives and utilizing attributes in each component's store to facilitate attribute-based communication. For instance, communication could be limited to a geographic range, or interactions may be limited to agents that are co-located, modeling spatial heterogeneity.

Carma components engage with one another through specified communication primitives, supporting unicast and broadcast modes in a locally synchronous but globally asynchronous manner. Communication is governed by attribute-based predicates, ensuring that messages are only sent and received when the attributes meet specific conditions. The time it takes for these communicating actions is modeled as an exponentially distributed random variable influenced by the environment.

The paper then moves on to discuss global goals for systems, which represent the desired outcomes or properties of the system. Such goals might include a destination for agents to navigate towards or a threshold for failed components that must not be exceeded. Monitoring whether a system has achieved these goals is possible in a state-by-state manner through simulated traces, without altering the system's original behavior.

The initial implementation links defined goals to measures, which currently cannot influence the system's evolution due to language and implementation limitations. The Carma language may need modification to enable these measures to guide control decisions in future development.

A software tool has been created to test the changes proposed for the Carma language. This tool processes Carma models by modifying the source code to reflect the prescribed constraints and goals without altering the existing simulation framework.

The paper discusses how stochastic process algebras have proven beneficial in analyzing emergent behaviors in CAS, particularly focusing on computer-based systems like robot swarms and wireless sensor networks. The intent is to apply a process algebraic framework for designing control policies in such systems.

The paper references prior works and methodologies that apply formal methods to study and design for CAS and swarm robotics, including the model checking of swarm behaviors and the automatic synthesis of control policies based on formal models and logic-based specifications.

Finally, a scenario from swarm robotics showcases the analysis of CAS using resource constraints and global goals. A controlled system with a simple policy is compared with an uncontrolled system to observe whether the specified global goal is met through system trajectory simulations.
