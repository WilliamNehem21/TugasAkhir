In the given example, we are introduced to two nondeterministic processes, A1 and A2, with different behaviors but the same input-output relations concerning strings of tokens. Process A1 has the capability to either produce a single token and then terminate or emit a token, await the reception of a token, and subsequently release one more token. On the other hand, Process A2 can also generate a single token and then halt or initiate by waiting to receive a token before releasing two tokens in succession. Despite their distinct operational sequences, both processes ultimately achieve identical input-output string relationships regarding the tokens they handle.
