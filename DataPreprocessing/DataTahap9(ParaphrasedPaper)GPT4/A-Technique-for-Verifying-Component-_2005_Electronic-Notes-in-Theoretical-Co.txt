This academic paper discusses challenges in testing component-based software systems that evolve through modification or replacement of their components. To address these issues, the paper suggests a technique for automatically detecting behavioral differences across different system versions, which might indicate potential inconsistencies and problems. The technique relies on extracting invariants from real-world software operation, which serve to monitor new components for unexpected interactions. These monitoring results are then analyzed by software engineers to identify any issues in newer versions of the system.

Specifically, the paper references the work of Raz et al., who use computed invariants to understand the behavior of data feed systems. While their work focuses on storing invariants locally on the client side, the technique proposed in the paper, known as BCT (Behavioral Change Tracking), takes a broader approach. BCT uses invariants to track both system and component evolution, verifying the correctness of the actual implementation.

Preliminary experiments using BCT to identify incompatibilities between Java Pet Store versions have shown it capable of detecting various faults. Future work involves expanding the experimental data on BCT to establish its benefits further and developing a tool suite for its automated application to extensive experimental software. This will help assess the challenges of implementing BCT on an industrial scale, as well as its effectiveness in detecting faults when compared to other methods.
