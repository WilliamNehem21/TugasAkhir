To evaluate the role of agriculture in carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas mitigation within rice paddies, it's essential to grasp the carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles within these ecosystems. Field studies and simulation experiments have provided foundational data on these biogeochemical processes. Advances in science and technology, combined with a deeper understanding of the C and N cycles, have led to the development of models that can quantify and forecast ecosystem material flows. Specifically, process-oriented models examine biogeochemical C and N dynamics and can analyze these processes over various geographical and temporal scales.

Notably, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recommends several process models for greenhouse gas inventories, such as the CENTURY, RothC, CH4MOD, and DNDC-Rice. The DNDC model, created by Li and colleagues in 1992, is widely applied to simulate C and N cycling in diverse ecosystems, including agricultural fields, wetlands, forests, and grasslands. It is especially effective in evaluating soil C and N dynamics and greenhouse gas emissions within rice paddies.

The DNDC model estimates emissions of gases like CO2, CH4, N2O, and NH3 from soil, which result mainly from microbial activity affected by soil environmental conditions. Factors such as soil temperature, moisture, pH, and electrical potential, along with substrate concentrations, are vital for accurately modeling greenhouse gas emissions.

For example, adjustment of the model by Pathak et al. in 2005 to account for higher leakage of substances like dissolved organic carbon and nitrates led to a reduction in methane emissions in scenarios with high leakage but didn't affect lower leakage scenarios. The DNDC model can simulate soil organic carbon dynamics with high accuracy for different climate conditions, and it uses electron donors like hydrogen and organic carbon to track changes in soil redox potential, thereby determining the rates of methane and nitrous oxide production and consumption.

Methane production is carried out by methanogenic bacteria using substrates like soil humus and rice root exudates, while methanotrophic bacteria in the root zone or micro-oxidative soil areas oxidize some of the methane to carbon dioxide and water. The model can simulate methane and nitrous oxide emissions in flooded rice fields through modules that mimic these biogeochemical processes.

Additionally, the DNDC model can simulate different water management practices, predicting their impact on greenhouse gas emissions over time and space. Research has shown that the model can distinguish between rice yields of different varieties under varying nitrogen loads and water management practices. Reductions in nitrogen fertilizer, based on current usage, can decrease greenhouse gas emissions without sacrificing crop yield. For instance, reducing nitrogen fertilizer in China's major rice-producing regions could lower greenhouse gas emissions by up to 40%.

Applying external carbon sources like straw or manure can substantially increase methane emissions from rice fields. However, plastic mulching techniques can reduce methane emissions by 86% while maintaining yields, due to altered soil climate conditions affecting soil moisture, microbial activity, and gas diffusion.

As environmental challenges and agricultural methods evolve, the predictive capability of models like DNDC becomes increasingly valuable. Future directions involve evaluating the combined impacts of various agricultural interventions on soil organic carbon, greenhouse gases, food security, and the environment, and refining the DNDC model to better serve low-carbon rice production from local to regional scales and to build a reliable prediction and evaluation system for agricultural and climatic scenarios.
