In this paper, we explore a version of alternating-time temporal logic (ATL) that factors in limited memory for each agent, presenting it as a practical and computationally feasible model, unlike many systems with perfect recall and imperfect information, which suffer from undecidable model-checking issues.

Traditionally, when dealing with incomplete information, it's common to assume that agents remember everything (perfect recall). However, we suggest an alternative approach that incorporates imperfect recall, where an agent's memory is explicitly defined. This doesn't imply that agents forget everything, just that their memory is limited.

Consider a scenario illustrating our model: a banker knows the combination to a safe and a robber aims to learn this code to open the safe. Under ATL with complete information, this scenario is unrealistic because the robber would have immediate access to the combination from the banker's knowledge. By introducing explicit memory, we make the model more realistic. If the robber has limited memory and forgets the code on the way to the safe, he cannot open it. With sufficient memory, however, the perfect recall strategy can still be applied.

In our examples, we assess strategies where the robber enters the vault and attempts to use a specific code. Success depends on whether the code tried matches the actual safe code. To handle memory constraints in our model, we utilize a strategy construction approach that fits within a polynomial-time hierarchy, making it computationally manageable.

The encoding of agent knowledge is carried out through a direct valuation of paths in a game with two players. The complexity of the model is kept polynomial thanks to the use of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) for the text form of formulas, despite potential exponential expansion when replacing variables with their definitions.

Model-checking our imperfect recall, imperfect information ATL variant (ATLIR) is NP-complete, meaning while finding strategies can be challenging, verifying them is tractable. We offer heuristic methods for constructing imperfect recall (IR) strategies for ATLIR to facilitate this process.

Our study compares agent models with varying levels of information and recall. Perfect information increases the power of the model-checking but simplifies the problem, whereas perfect recall increases complexity. Imperfect information and recall strike a balance, offering realistic agent behaviors and solvable model-checking challenges.

The paper also highlights the significance of agent knowledge, which is not explicitly accounted for in the logics studied. Introducing an explicit knowledge operator could be valuable, but its precise function would depend on the strategies selected by cooperating agents, suggesting the need for logic with explicit strategies.
