We present a method capable of establishing whether a particular function qualifies as a measurement. This method's effectiveness is illustrated through its application to three classically challenging concepts: capacity in information theory, entropy in quantum mechanics, and global time in general relativity. We also introduce a novel and intriguing way of characterizing measurement that stems from our technique, suggesting it can be universally implemented.

Previously, the status of capacity as a measurement in information theory was uncertain. Although it was previously proven that capacity measures its kernel, the argument's intricacy thwarted a general application across all channels. With the introduction of Theorem 3.2, we now have the means to assert that capacity indeed measures across the full range of intervals, negating the need for further investigation.

Our former interpretation of the bijection between the natural numbers N and the interval [0, 1] was to mobilize domain-theoretic structure from [0, 1] to N. A new approach allows the reciprocal: imparting the topological structure of N onto [0, 1]. By doing so, we endow [0, 1] with the Euclidean topology that N, as part of the plane, naturally possesses. Consequently, we depict [0, 1] as the region within the unit square that lies on or beneath the principal diagonal.

Acknowledgments include a note of gratitude from the first author towards the second author, not only for the fruitful collaboration but also for a treasured friendship. The second author expresses mutual appreciation and extends a standing invitation to the first author for an annual workshop at the Bellairs Research Institute in Barbados, an invitation that the first author heartily accepts.
