The academic paper discusses the intricacies and formal consequences of representing partial functions as total functions within constructive type theory, which serves as the metalanguage. Since functions in this theory must be total, encoding partial functions demands a formal adaptation.

Another point addressed is the use of inductive-recursive definitions in certain mathematical model constructions and proofs of normalization. These definitions are constructively valid; however, many authors prefer to interpret them through set theory, which again affects the formal structures.

When discussing dependent types, the paper references how the programming language Agda does not compel users to only create well-founded data types and terminating functions but emphasizes that such regulations may be enforced by future checkers. For now, it is the responsibility of users to adhere to certain logical disciplines.

Agda also facilitates the handling of complex expressions common in monomorphic type theory by allowing users to suppress arguments that can be inferred from context. Such suppressed arguments are termed 'implicit'. The paper exemplifies this with the function 'id', showing how Agda can infer its first argument if provided with the second.

The paper goes on to briefly explain how categories, functors, terminal objects, and context comprehension can be defined within type theory using Agda. Specifically, it outlines the notion of internal categories with finite limits (CWF), which encompasses categories with terminal objects and the capability for constructing pullbacksâ€”a type-theoretic construct that encapsulates an object, arrows, proofs of commutativity, and a proof of the universal property.

Lastly, the paper notes that the inductive definition method used falls outside the standard schema found in constructive type theory. The authors express belief in its constructive significance and propose to broaden the schema, as well as to extend set-theoretic semantics to accommodate it, as part of their future research.
