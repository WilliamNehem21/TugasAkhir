The paper discusses that software errors often go undetected until the system is in active use, where critical failures can severely disrupt the services provided to users. To address errors, the conventional method is reporting the issues to the developers, who investigate and fix them, followed by the release of a patch or updated version. However, this traditional process has several shortcomings.

To address these limitations, different techniques are proposed:

1. **Infinite Recursion Elimination**: The method limits the stack size and returns from any call that exceeds this limit. While it may end some recursions prematurely, it also prevents fatal errors due to unbounded recursion.

2. **Memory Leak Elimination**: This approach uses a fixed-size buffer from which memory allocations occur in a cyclical fashion. Although it might overwrite active data, the method ensures that memory leaks at specific sites are eradicated.

3. **Invalid Addressing Elimination**: Also known as failure-oblivious computing, this technique involves bounds checking that discards out-of-bounds writes and generates random values for out-of-bounds reads. This might lead to issues if the program isn't designed to handle these arbitrary values, but it effectively avoids fatal errors stemming from invalid memory access.

These strategies aim to offer immediate solutions to prevent errors from becoming fatal, despite having potential trade-offs that might impact proper program execution.
