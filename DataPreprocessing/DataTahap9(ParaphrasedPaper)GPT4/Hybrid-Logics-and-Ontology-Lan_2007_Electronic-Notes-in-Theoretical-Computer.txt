In the context of ontologies, the inclusion of binders and state variables from hybrid logic has been identified as a potentially valuable feature for ontology languages. However, introducing this feature to even simpler languages can result in undecidability issues. Recent research indicates that state variables could be beneficial for querying when their use is restricted within certain syntactic structures, as this limitation enables decidable reasoning.

A common approach for addressing issues within a completion graph is to prune sub-trees below a particular node when it merges with another node, such as eliminating node x2 and its connecting edge from x1 upon merging with x0. While effective for tree-like structures where sub-trees are definable, this method is not applicable to graphs with non-tree configurations, such as when nominal nodes are introduced and merged.

There are known decision procedures for certain constrained segments of conjunctive queries. Typically, a query is only decidable if each role within it is simple, meaning it does not involve transitivity or sub-roles that are transitive.

The mentioned technique is not suitable for cyclic query graphs because the tree model property associated with description logics (DLs) cannot encapsulate cyclic relationships, and even nominals fail to accurately represent the complex cyclical structures found in certain queries.
