The key area of focus will be the category dgbal, which includes rooted dialogue games and strategies that are balanced and free from conflict. To compare these dialogue games with graph games, we modify the definition of a positional graph (Definition 1.6) linked to a dialogue game by taking into account only the balanced positions.

Definition 6.2: The balanced graph G(A) for a rooted dialogue game A is defined as the subset of GraphA that only includes balanced positions and the connections (edges) between them. It's important to note that the paths in G(A) match exactly the balanced trajectories within the game A.
