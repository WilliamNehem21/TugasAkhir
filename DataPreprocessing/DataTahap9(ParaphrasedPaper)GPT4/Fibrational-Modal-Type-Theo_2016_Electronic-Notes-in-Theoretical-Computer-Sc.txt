The paper discusses a semantic framework based on category theory for understanding modal type theories. In particular, it builds upon Prawitz's foundational work and employs the binary approach of categorical modeling found in the Curry-Howard correspondence. This perspective allows the authors to treat modal systems on the same footing as their intuitionistic counterparts. The initial goal was to repurpose existing tools for handling the reductions in the simply typed lambda-calculus.

The paper outlines that both weakening and contraction for variables are permissible due to the typing rules, and it mentions that exchange is also acceptable. While the rules could encompass conjunctions and disjunctions, the focus here is on the core connectives of implication and modality.

The more intricate context structure in the discussed modal logic (DIML) leads to a complex metatheory. The paper notes that two substitution lemmas are necessary, mirroring the dual nature of variables, similar to what is found in linear lambda-calculus. Without considering terms, these lemmas relate to the cut rule, which is demonstrated to be admissible within the framework.

The authors propose an alternative approach to modeling the DIML type theory using fibrations rather than adjunctions, even though the conventional fibration model was intended for theories with dependent types. It is suggested that the fibration framework can still be applicable under certain restrictions.

A significant contribution of the paper is the introduction of modalities as dependent types in a fibrational semantics setting for constructive modal type theory, an innovation that appears to be original in the field.

When dealing with dependent type theories, the authors acknowledge the complexity of the meta-theory, pointing out the significance of subject reduction. They advocate using established methods for proving necessary theorems, similar to standard dependent type theory.

Integrating rules for universes into the mix of rules for dependent products, dependent sums, and identity types presents a challenge due to their interconnectedness. The paper suggests that there might also be a fifth class of rules—modal rules—that seem to be independent from the others.

The paper concludes by stating that the authors have examined two modal type theories: one non-dependent (DIML) and one dependent (DepDIML) linked to constructive necessity in logic, showing that they are coherent from a proof-theoretical standpoint. Fibrational models for these theories have been found to be both sound and complete using known techniques. They also mention the possibility of integrating explicit substitutions into both dependent and non-dependent versions, leaving the utility of this modal type theory for homotopy type theory as a question for future research.
