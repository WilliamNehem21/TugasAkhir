This paper introduces a novel needle actuation mechanism for jacquard knitting machines by incorporating a magnetic levitation (maglev) system, combining both electromagnets and permanent magnets. This innovation departs from traditional mechanical multi-stage transmissions, offering a new method for driving needles. Detailed theoretical analysis and simulations demonstrate the feasibility of controlling needle movement through this maglev system. The research shows that this approach can lead to more efficient jacquard knitting, with a simpler and more easily programmable structure. The paper provides foundational theories that will pave the way for further experimental work in developing this magnetic needle drive system.

Magnetic suspension technology, which emerged in the 20th century, is celebrated for its non-contact nature, eliminating friction and wear and thereby extending the lifespan of devices while enhancing their operational conditions. The technology is finding applications across various fields including transportation, machinery, and aerospace.
