This paper investigates a machine learning-based approach to detect seizures in EEG recordings across different brain regions and multiple subjects, presenting a new method to generalize seizure detection. The method classifies seizure and non-seizure instances using a dataset comprising 342 EEG records from 24 patients. The approach demonstrates promising results, outperforming previous studies with an accuracy of 88% sensitivity and specificity, and an AUC of 93%, by employing the k-NN classifier.

Epilepsy affects 70 million people globally and poses a higher risk at life's extremes, often leading to premature death. Seizures can be either focal, affecting a single brain area, or general, impacting both brain hemispheres. EEG, which visualizes brain electrical activity, is critical for epilepsy diagnosis but is challenging to interpret.

This study uses a robust data processing methodology, training various classifiers with EEG segments to identify whole-brain seizure patterns, thus aiding in earlier epilepsy diagnosis and treatment. The paper is organized to first describe EEG principles and feature extraction, then proceeding to detail machine learning for classification, evaluation methods, and finally discussing the results and concluding remarks.

Previous research primarily focuses on detecting patient-specific focal seizures, using algorithms like SVM that achieve high accuracy but are limited to individual patients' EEG patterns.

In contrast, this paper presents a broader approach, embedding machine learning algorithms within clinical systems to streamline diagnostics, potentially reducing the demand for specialists. The dataset analyzed is balanced across seizures and non-seizures, with blocks reflecting different ictal and non-ictal data proportions, aiming for real-world applicability.

The study employs various feature selection methods and validation techniques like holdout cross-validation to assess the accuracy of classifiers. Generalized across a population, the k-NN classifier shows the best performance, indicating the approach's potential for clinical use in diagnosing epilepsy and related disorders.

Future directions include exploring additional features, advanced machine learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks and SVM variations, and different window sizes to further improve accuracy. The paper also suggests further comparison of linear and nonlinear methods, with the goal of enhancing seizure detection in clinical settings. The development of automated seizure detection could address current healthcare system challenges, such as specialist shortages, and complement teleEEG and online systems despite data security concerns.
