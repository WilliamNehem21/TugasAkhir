The paper discusses two primary strategies for diagnosing plant nutrient deficiencies: destructive methods, such as lab testing, which carry higher risks of human error, and non-destructive methods, like digital image processing combined with machine learning, which offer more objective outcomes. The research focuses on classifying the health conditions of chili plants in Indonesia, which are typically grown under varying lighting conditions that can disrupt single-feature identification techniques like color analysis. Thus, the study incorporates multiple features including shape, texture, and color to enhance the identification accuracy of nutrient deficiencies.

Specifically, the study samples seven chili plants in a hydroponic setup, subjecting them to five levels of macronutrient reduction, each decreasing by intervals of 20% from 10% to 90%. These conditions are maintained for a week to monitor visible changes. The research evaluates different feature extraction methods, comparing RGB and HSV color models, LBP and GLCM for texture analysis, and Hu moments and statistical measures derived from centroid-to-edge pixel distances for shape evaluation.

The texture feature proves vital in identifying calcium deficiencies, as color alone would lead to misclassification due to its similarity with healthy plants. The classification system employs various machine learning and deep learning models (e.g., MLP, SVM, Naive Bayes, RFT, and CNN) and compares their effectiveness. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall are used to assess the models, as they are critical to distinguishing between nutrients that share similar characteristics.

Through a series of experiments, the study explores individual and combined feature performance, different feature combinations, the impact of MLP hyperparameter variations, and comparisons to previous work. It is found that a combination of RGB color features and GLCM texture features yields the highest accuracy. Additionally, a combined approach of RGB, GLCM, and Hu moments outperforms other combinations.

MLP architecture is optimized by adjusting the learning rate, revealing improved performance at 0.002. The epoch count is also fine-tuned to prevent overfitting, with 300 epochs being the sweet spot for the highest performance of the model. The research underscores some limitations where the model may misidentify conditions due to overlapping characteristics, especially at lower levels.

The study concludes by recognizing the augmentation of data and the superior performance of CNN over traditional machine learning methods, despite their higher complexity. The final model holds potential for use in intelligent hydroponic systems, contributing to precision agriculture by enabling regular health monitoring for plants and optimizing nutrient solutions. Future endeavors aim to refine the model to identify specific nutrient deficiencies and estimate their severity.
