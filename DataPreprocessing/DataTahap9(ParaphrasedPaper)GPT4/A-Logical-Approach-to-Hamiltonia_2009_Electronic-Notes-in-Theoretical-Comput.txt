A logical framework may offer the broad applicability needed for certain tasks. In simple, laymanâ€™s terms, this involves considering a certain logic identified as 'L', with its set of rules and structures for interpreting the meaning of these rules. To properly use this logic, we must be able to:

1. Determine if the language used by a given modal logic is powerful enough to characterize a specific property we're interested in, such as a graph property.
2. If the logic in question cannot characterize the property, we need to look for a more expressive logical language.
3. If we find a suitable logical language, we have to assess the computational complexity involved in using that logic to verify if the property, like the Hamiltonian property for graphs, applies to a specific case.

It has been established that the language used in basic graph logic doesn't possess the required expressive strength. Therefore, the goal is to find a logic with a more powerful language that can address the problems defined earlier while still being decidable.

Before determining the appropriate formula for characterizing Hamiltonian graphs, one must first address relevant graph-theoretical challenges. Currently, no known criteria in graph theory comprehensively determine whether a graph is Hamiltonian. If we were to devise a formula that captures the essence of Hamiltonian graphs without directly describing a Hamiltonian cycle, it would effectively be uncovering such comprehensive criteria. Our formulas, therefore, are designed to examine all paths in a graph on the lookout for a Hamiltonian cycle. Consequently, a formula for a graph with 'n' vertices will employ 'n' different labels or placeholders.

The most straightforward approach to delineate the Hamiltonian property is via brute force, using a formula that increases factorial with the graph's size. However, this approach is fundamentally impractical for frame-checking due to the formula's length. Beyond the unwieldy length of the formula, there are additional issues, which we illustrate with an alternative formula that has a polynomial length relative to the graph's size.
