Data impurities, such as noise, outliers, missing values, duplicates, or anomalies, can be addressed using data cleansing techniques, while data augmentation can resolve issues with small data sets by increasing diversity without new data collection, improving model generalization (Shorten & Khoshgoftaar, 2019). Common augmentation techniques involve modifying copies of existing data or creating synthetic data. 

Applications of data augmentation extend to multiple AI fields, including computer vision (using cropping, flipping, and color jittering) and NLP (with interpolation and rule-based techniques). Time series classification also employs random transformations (Iwana & Uchida, 2021).

For crop management, ML and DL are harnessed for tasks like crop yield forecasting, which depend on data like soil, weather, and environmental parameters for pre-season estimates or data during various crop stages for within-season forecasting. Aggregating multiple small datasets can enhance yield forecasting models.

A study integrated cereal yield data across provinces with additional identifiers, building models for different crop stages and a combined model incorporating crop types. Historical durum wheat yields and climatic data from two provinces formed the basis for the yield forecasting study, despite some data unavailability.

Data was divided into 70% training and 30% test sets, using three-fold cross-validation for training the ML algorithms. Various regression methods (ANN, DNN, ELM, RF, SVR) showed varying performances, with algorithms better suited to large datasets performing well when data was augmented. For durum wheat yield prediction, ANN, DNN, and ELM excelled compared to RF and SVR. Models varied in their accuracy of estimations, with some under or overestimating yields.

Relative humidity was particularly influential in semi-arid zones, motivating the use of the ALE plot, an unbiased feature influence model, and ICE plots, which illustrated the significance of humidity on yield predictions differently in Mediterranean versus semi-arid climates.

Data augmentation helped improve prediction quality, leveraging broader climatic variation and intrinsic yield potential. Limitations included not accounting for sub-regional variabilities and management practices, which could influence outcomes. Field-level climate data could enhance predictions further, including via deep learning models like CNNs that use satellite image data.

The study found that merging datasets from two provinces improved model performance. DNN models were most effective for one province, while RF models excelled in another, illustrating the benefit of the data augmentation-by-merging approach in developing robust AI models for crop yield prediction.
