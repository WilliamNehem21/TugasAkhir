This paragraph presents information from an academic paper discussing a finite group "g" with elements denoted as {g1, g2, ..., gk, 1}, where "1" is the identity element of the group, and the group operation is multiplication. In the context of this work, there is a logic called ltlgrp(g), which applies when "g" is the only group being considered.

Two specific lemmas, Lemma 3.4 and Lemma 3.5, are mentioned. They enable the reformation of logic statements that have past time operators nested within future time operators. Complementary to these are dual lemmas which can be applied when the positions of the past and future operators are interchanged.

A collection of lemmas is provided to demonstrate that formulas in ltlgrp(g) can be decomposed. These supporting lemmas are validated using mathematical induction based on the structure of the formulas being considered. This process allows for the simplification or restructuring of complex temporal logic statements within the scope of the group "g".
