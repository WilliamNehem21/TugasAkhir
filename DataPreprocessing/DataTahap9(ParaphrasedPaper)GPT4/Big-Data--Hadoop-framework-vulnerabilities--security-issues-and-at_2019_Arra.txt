The academic paper describes the growing importance of big data as a collection of vast amounts of valuable data collected from diverse sources like social media, sensors, and transaction records, which businesses can leverage to make evidence-based decisions. The term 'big data' was introduced by Charles Tilly in the 1980s, and today, it plays a crucial role in many sectors such as healthcare, insurance, and online platforms.

The Hadoop framework is central to the storage and processing of big data, utilizing a distributed computing model on clusters of commodity computers. Despite its cost-effectiveness and speed, the flexibility of the Hadoop framework introduces several security vulnerabilities that pose threats to data integrity and can lead to attacks. The paper reviews these vulnerabilities, explores solutions to mitigate risks, and discusses the experimental setup used to conduct common attacks to further understand and prevent them. The results emphasize the need for "defense in depth" to ensure data security.

Hadoop's distributed file system (HDFS) is acknowledged for its fault tolerance, storing large files across a networked cluster in blocks, and managing data-node replication for availability. Moreover, the paper delves into the MapReduce programming model, a parallel processing system integral to Hadoop's operation, detailing its architecture and the job scheduling process managed by the JobTracker.

Vulnerabilities in the Hadoop ecosystem are classified into three main categories: infrastructure security, data privacy, and data management, with further examination across dimensions of architecture, data life cycle, and value chain. The paper discusses various security measures and frameworks, including encryption mechanisms, Kerberos authentication protocol, and monitoring tools, to enhance the protection of data in Hadoop and cloud environments.

Furthermore, the paper examines databases that catalogue vulnerabilities, such as the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) and the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE). The role of patch management in addressing security weaknesses is highlighted, along with the use of vulnerability scanners and the importance of investigating data leakage in Hadoop.

A key point raised is that Hadoop, originally designed without a security focus, now requires additional security measures due to its widespread use. The paper emphasizes the importance of understanding and mitigating threats through strategies like defense-in-depth, to counter vulnerabilities and secure data within the Hadoop ecosystem.

Additionally, the paper explores specific security threats like impersonation attacks, denial of service (DoS) attacks, and cross-site scripting (XSS), explaining their potential impact on Hadoop operations. The authors underscore the importance of thorough vulnerability assessment and strategic planning to protect against data attacks. The paper concludes with the notion that traditional security products are insufficient for the unique challenges of big data security, urging organizations to adopt new protective measures and effective security training for IT users.
