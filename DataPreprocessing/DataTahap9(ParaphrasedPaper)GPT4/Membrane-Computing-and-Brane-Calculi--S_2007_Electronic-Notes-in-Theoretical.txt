The paper presents a brief analysis highlighting the shared features and differences between the fields of membrane computing and brane calculi. It particularly emphasizes recent initiatives aimed at integrating these two research domains, providing a comprehensive reference list to support this perspective. The author argues that perceived differences between the two may not be substantial.

The discussion focuses on two types of brane calculus, based on operations like pino, exo, and phago, as well as mate, drip, and bud, while acknowledging that L. Cardelli and colleagues have explored additional process algebra calculi. A commonly noted distinction is the localization of objectsâ€”in regions for membrane computing and on membranes for brane calculus. However, this difference is contested by the possibility of considering membranes as bilayers with interspaces, effectively creating compartments on the membrane itself. This concept has already been utilized in prior research, although it comes with certain limitations when manipulating objects and is not suitable for representing operations involving membranes.
