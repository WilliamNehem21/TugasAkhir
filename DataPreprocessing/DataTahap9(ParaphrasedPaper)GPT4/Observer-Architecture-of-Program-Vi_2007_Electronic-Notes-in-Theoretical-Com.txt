We present an innovative observer architecture designed for enhancing program visualization. This architecture is founded on key concepts like modular, model-driven design, unidirectional relationships between components, structured management, inter-component communication, and visualizer data storage. It boasts scalability and allows for visualization components to be distributed and adjusted without affecting the program's core model. This architecture has been effectively applied to our interactive learning tools for programming, known as problets.

In problets, a program model is automatically generated for each exercise, capturing the program's structural layout and operational behavior. For the observer architecture, every element of the program model becomes a 'watchable' entity, tagged to a corresponding observer entity tasked with picturing the object's state changes. The visualization framework mirrors the program model's hierarchy, a concept borrowed from the model-view-controller design pattern typically used in graphical user interface development.

To cohesively operate, isolated visualization entities within this framework use message-passing to sync with one another. This mechanism is especially useful for illustrating interactions like variable assignments or pointer operations. In such cases, visualization objects send messages through the architectural hierarchy until the message reaches its target, ensuring appropriate coordination.

Our observer architecture advances earlier frameworks by incorporating hierarchical delegation and message-passing coordination, alongside the existing principles of model-view separation and unidirectional linking. Unlike the static storage in previous models, our approach uses structured delegation for data management.

The architecture is driven by an inherent model, facilitating more nuanced domain representations and supporting diverse input data, thereby enhancing educational program visualization. This approach also means instructors face less overhead, as they need only define the desired program rather than its visualization, with the architecture creating it automatically.

Though our observer architecture broadly applies across visualization domains, it does require a substantial model, like a language interpreter for programming visualization, which may be challenging to develop.

Problets operate on parameterized templates, empowering users to execute and visualize new programs easily. Thanks to clear distinctions between what's observable and what's an observer, developers can offer various visual representations of programming constructs. Users can select from multiple visual options as straightforwardly as choosing an item from a menu, and personalize their visualization experience as permitted by the capabilities of the individual visual objects. Thus, every component of a program can be individually customized within the collective visualization.
