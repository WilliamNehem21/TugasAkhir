The red swamp crayfish (P. clarkii) is a resilient species native to the northeastern region of Mexico and the south-central United States. Its robust nature has allowed it to thrive under various environmental stressors such as poor water quality, temperature changes, low oxygen levels, and dry conditions. Due to its rapid growth in aquaculture, it has been introduced worldwide, becoming the most prevalent freshwater crayfish species wherever it has been established. P. clarkii represents at least 80% of the global harvest of both wild and farmed crayfish, with over 60,000 tons produced annually in countries like the USA and China.

Research by Ibrahim et al. assessed the effects of the organophosphorus insecticide fenthion on P. clarkii, finding that the LC50 (lethal concentration to kill 50% of the population) was 1 mg/L after 12 hours of exposure. However, the negative impact of fenthion was only evident in closed aquatic systems such as some fishponds but not in open waters like the Nile or its irrigation channels. Abdel Mageed's research also indicated that heavy metals accumulate in various tissues of P. clarkii from the Nile River. Furthermore, chronic exposure to the insecticide fenitrothion caused histopathological damages in the crayfish's hepatopancreas, testes, and ovaries, with the severity of tissue change depending on exposure time and the animal's ability to resist fenitrothion toxicity. Heiba's study found that exposure to copper sulfate severely damaged the testes of P. clarkii.

In a separate study, P. clarkii specimens of 12 to 14 cm in length were exposed to graded concentrations of substances to determine LC50 and LC90 values using the methodology sanctioned by the World Health Organization (WHO), with samples being tested in triplicate.

Furthermore, protein analysis via sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was performed following Boswell et al.â€™s protocol. Muscle proteins estimated after one and four weeks were separated on gels using electrophoresis equipment, and muscle tissues were harvested from the abdomen region of crayfish samples.

An experiment demonstrated that the survival rate of P. clarkii significantly decreased when exposed to sub-lethal concentrations of the fungus T. harzianum. This finding aligns with Abdul-Wahid et al., which showed complete mortality of Periplaneta americana cockroaches within 24 hours due to T. harzianum. Other studies, like those by Sakran, Al-Assiuty et al., and Stephan et al., discussed the effects of various substances on different organisms, suggesting that fungicides like T. harzianum and P. oligandrum impact species diversity and abundance, not through direct toxicity but via alteration of the soil's fungal community.

Di Pietro argued that the toxicity of Trichoderma harzianum comes from its production of various poisonous and antibiotic compounds. Lorito et al. confirmed that chitinase enzymes produced by Trichoderma can degrade the cell walls of pathogenic fungi, which are composed of chitin. Examples of biopesticides such as metarhizium anisopliae's streptozotocin also exemplify toxins derived from microbial pesticides, which can be harmful to marine life, as demonstrated by its LC50 of 52 mg/L for Palaemonetes pugio shrimp. Finally, the mortality of P. clarkii could sometimes be attributed to fungal spore blockages in the gills, as observed in studies on cockroaches.
