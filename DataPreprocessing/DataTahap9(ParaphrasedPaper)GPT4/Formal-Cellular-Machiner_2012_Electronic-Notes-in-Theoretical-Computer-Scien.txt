In the last decade, the computer science field has taken an interest in applying formal methods to systems biology, with the aim to develop a calculus that encapsulates biological elements like proteins and cellular structures. Despite many proposals, there is no definitive solution yet. Important concepts include:

1. Cells as graphs with nodes (molecules) linked by edges (physical contacts).
2. Languages that naturally incorporate spatial information.

The presented language introduces compartments and the concept of projective membrane reactions. A matching algorithm is proposed, which is both sound and complete. This allows the creation and deletion of compartments.

The language also addresses the diffusion problem by providing tools to describe the connected components involved in molecular reactions. This facilitates modeling both localized interactions and broader system-level processes.

A foundational grammar allows for the specification of protein interactions, with restrictions to ensure each site is connected in a specific, logical manner. This vocabulary lacks the capability to name specific molecular domains or proteins, which would enable more nuanced modeling of molecular reactions.

The authors aim to extend the basic model to include compartments before increasing expressiveness further. This step should accommodate names and provide a contextual framework for better defining molecular reactions, keeping in mind that our understanding of molecular objects is always subject to refinement with additional context.

In their current state, molecules are assumed to exist in a spatially uniform reactive medium. The paper suggests using bigraphical techniques to introduce a concept of compartmentalization without the complexity of adding an overwhelming number of rules.

The language is extended to include terms that reflect compartmentalization. A further enhancement is the introduction of parameter names to the existing grammar, with the same restrictions on connectivity to ensure meaningful representation of biological interactions.

In the next step, connectivity becomes crucial for simulating particular interactions, including diffusion processes. A proposition within the paper indicates that certain species nodes can be eliminated from a mixture if certain conditions are met, related to connectivity and free names.

Finally, internal states of sites can be tagged to indicate chemical modifications; absence of a tag means that the particular internal state is not specified within the expression.

In summary, the paper outlines the development of a language that can be used to describe and analyze complex biological systems at both the micro and macro levels, with specific focus on maintaining balanced expressiveness and accommodating biological realism.
