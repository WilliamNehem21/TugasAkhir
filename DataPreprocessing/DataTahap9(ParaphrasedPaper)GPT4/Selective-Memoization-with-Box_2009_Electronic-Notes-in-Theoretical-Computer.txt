The academic paper presents a framework for selective memoization using box types to understand the dependencies involved in memoized functions. The paper is structured as follows:

1. Introduction to the concept of selective memoization and an explanation of the use of box types.
2. Description of a selective memoization system named SM with box types, covered in Section 2.
3. Introduction of an auxiliary system, S, which maintains selectivity without involving storage effects, presented in Section 3 alongside a proof of its type safety.
4. Proof of the type safety of SM by translating it into the auxiliary system S, detailed in Section 4.
5. A translation from system S to the purely functional language PCF in Section 5, which indirectly verifies the soundness of SM's effectful evaluation semantics against the functional semantics of PCF.
6. Final remarks and discussion of future work in Section 6.

The paper highlights the usage of a box type instead of the bang modality, arguing that the box type is more theoretically robust. The framework features a static semantic system that tracks location labels in expressions and ensures unique label assignments for memoized functions.

The paper also indicates that while the system S lacks explicit effects, it's still not purely functional due to the distinction between types and expressions and the retention of selectivity. A translation to PCF aims to address this by adopting a thoroughly functional perspective.

Additionally, the paper calls attention to challenges that arise with composite value types like records, emphasizing the need for finely grained data dependency modeling. It also contemplates extending the framework to include inductive types aligned with course-of-value recursion, as seen in dynamic programming scenarios, drawing from prior research in this area.
