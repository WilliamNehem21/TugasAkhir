To demonstrate how fixed terms and case construction are applied within the context of coalgebraic frameworks, consider the following example, which has been modified from a source in the referenced literature. Imagine a collection, denoted as A, which comprises binary trees, potentially an infinite number. Each tree, referred to as x, is either a solitary node without offspring or has a pair of progeny that can be derived by eliminating the uppermost node.

In this scenario, "st" serves as a symbolic representation of the state space for a particular coalgebra. A type earns the classification of "rigid" when "st" does not fall under its subcategories. Therefore, the set encompassing rigid types is the smallest set containing the element 'o' and adheres to specific criteria, labeled as (1) and (2).

At this juncture, all necessary instruments for structurally identifying classes of coalgebras that can be logically defined are established. The upcoming conclusion mirrors that of theorem 9.2, which pertains to monomial functors, in terms of polynomial functors. This theorem's underlying logic is consistent with the reasoning in theorem 9.2.
