This paper explores the concepts of pseudo-commutative monads and pseudo-closed 2-categories, with primary examples derived from the 2-monad on the category of small symmetric monoidal categories. The authors demonstrate that the 2-category of algebras for any pseudo-commutative 2-monad on this category is inherently pseudo-closed. They provide additional definitions and findings to support their work, and present further examples such as small categories with finite products and those relating to wiring, interaction, contexts, and the logic of bunched implication.

The need for a calculus of symmetric monoidal categories, potentially incorporating extra structure subject to certain axioms, is emphasized. This calculus would allow mathematical operations on symmetric monoidal categories to yield new symmetric monoidal categories. The discussion also reflects on how the 2-category of small symmetric monoidal categories, and related variations, might themselves be considered as symmetric monoidal categories.

Offering examples from computer science, the paper illustrates how such categories model contexts, parallelism, and interaction. Furthermore, the authors highlight current research using symmetric monoidal categories to capture call-by-name and call-by-value semantics.

In addition, the paper contrasts the presented definition with the classic notion of a closed category, noting the historical significance of enriching categories and reminding readers that monoidal closed categories are an evolution of this concept.

Finally, the paper acknowledges limitations to the scope of their definitions, particularly regarding strictness conditions observed in certain transformations that could not be incorporated without overly complicating the definitions. Thus, while recognizing a subset of stricter axioms present in examples, the authors chose not to include them in their formal definitions, instead opting for generality in their approach.
