In the medical field, practitioners rely on examining the heart's electrical activity through electrocardiograms (ECG) to predict various heart conditions. A specific heart condition known as bundle branch block (BBB) interferes with the heart's electrical impulse pathways, causing the heart to beat irregularly due to obstructions in the branching pathways, slowing down electrical impulses. This study focuses on diagnosing BBB using an adaptive bacterial foraging optimization (ABFO) algorithm.

The research utilizes data from the MIT/BIH Arrhythmia BBB database and applies the ABFO algorithm to extract key features from each ECG beat. These extracted features are then fed into a Levenberg-Marquardt neural network (LMNN) based classifier to identify the presence of BBB. The study's findings indicate that the proposed classification method using ABFO outperforms several recent algorithms reported in the literature.

The research explores incorporating the foraging behavior of E. coli bacteria in the algorithm. E. coli bacteria move by alternating between swimming in a straight direction and tumbling to change direction. The ABFO algorithm takes inspiration from this behavior, adapting the step-size based on the previous step's deviation during the last chemotaxis movement. This adaptiveness helps to optimize feature selection.

The ABFO algorithm, inspired by Kevin Passino's 2002 bacterial foraging optimization (BFO) algorithm, mimics the E. coli bacteria's foraging strategy to reduce the population size during optimization. In the model employed for this study, bacteria with six features each are represented in a matrix. The ABFO algorithm specifically selects features with high fitness, thereby improving the efficiency and accuracy of ECG feature detection and subsequently aiding in the accurate diagnosis of BBB.
