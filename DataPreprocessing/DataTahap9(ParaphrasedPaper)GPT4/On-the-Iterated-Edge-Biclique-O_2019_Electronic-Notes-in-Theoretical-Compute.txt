The academic paper discusses the concept of a clique graph as a transformation that converts one graph into another. The transformation, termed here as the clique operator, is applied repeatedly to generate an iterated clique graph, as introduced by Hedetniemi and Slater. The paper also examines graphs that can be reduced to a trivial graph through repeated applications, listing examples such as cographs, P4-tidy graphs, and circular-arc graphs.

Further discussed are divergent graphs and those exhibiting periodic behaviors. The existence of graphs that display a certain period or convergence in a specific number of iterations is noted, with references providing extensive details on iterated clique graphs.

In the realm of maximal bipartite complete induced subgraphs, known as bicliques, applications range from biology to social networks and information theory. The intersection graph of all bicliques of a given graph G, referred to as the biclique graph K_b(G), lacks a polynomial-time recognition algorithm, echoing the notion of it being an operator between graphs.

The notion of iterated biclique graphs is introduced as the result of applying the biclique operator iteratively to a graph G. This process of iteration ultimately leads a graph to exhibit convergence or divergence but not periodicity. Convergent and divergent behaviors are characterized, notably with graphs containing a clique of size five (or greater) or induced subgraphs like the gem or the rocket graphs, signaling divergence.

The paper then proposes to explore edge-biclique graphs, motivated by their relevance in representing relationships between two types of entities. By investigating the application of the edge-biclique operator multiple times, the paper aims to identify conditions that would define whether a graph converges or diverges under this transformation, suggesting conjectures for a comprehensive characterisation.

The paper is meticulously structured, with sections dedicated to defining terminology, presenting results on convergent and divergent graphs, and culminating in proposed conjectures about graph behavior under the edge-biclique operator.
