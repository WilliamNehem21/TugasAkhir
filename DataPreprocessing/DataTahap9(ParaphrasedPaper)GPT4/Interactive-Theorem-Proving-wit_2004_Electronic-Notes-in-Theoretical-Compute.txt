The paper discusses the limitations of current interactive theorem proving frameworks that are rooted in calculi designed for automated reasoning. Despite matching human reasoning well, there are still challenges with proof presentation and application of assertions.

The authors introduced a 'core system' to address these issues, which allows flexible, context-sensitive reasoning with a rewriting proof style. Over this system, a new layer, called the 'task layer,' has been developed. The task layer manages and structures proofs by referencing subgoals and maintaining a proof history, using a data structure known as an Indexed Formula Tree (IFT), which streamlines the handling of variable dependencies within proofs.

The core calculus supports focused reasoning processes without the need to decompose the original formula, through a feature called windows. These allow users to manipulate only certain parts of formulas without losing sight of the complete formula. The introduction of these windows also caters to a better interactive proof construction environment.

However, choosing which rules to apply and maintaining focus during proof construction remain challenges. There are too many potential replacement rules to choose from, and deciding where to focus can complicate proof search.

The task layer is introduced to overcome these issues by providing a structured approach to dividing proofs into subgoals, or 'tasks,' that can be more easily managed. Users can refine these tasks using task manipulation rules until all tasks are resolved, concluding the proof.

Examples of task manipulation rules include simple, complex, and speculative rules that enable the splitting of goals into subtasks, the application of assertions, or the introduction of lemmas.

To improve interaction with the user interface, the authors designed a 'box-line' representation, which simplifies the application of assertions and the overall proof construction process. The underlying core system ensures sound transformations during the proof construction process.

The paper aims to demonstrate that the task layer can structure and simplify the presentation of proofs in the core system, integrating and enhancing existing interactive proof techniques.

The authors advocate for a bottom-up approach to enhance proof assistants, making the task layer relatively independent of the logic layer. However, they stress the importance of retaining a sound logical basis while enabling the possibility of exchanging the logic layer.
