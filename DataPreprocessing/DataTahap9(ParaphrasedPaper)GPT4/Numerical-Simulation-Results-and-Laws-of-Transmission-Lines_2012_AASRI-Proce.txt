The research paper discusses the influence of electric current on the formation of ice on aerial cables, based on a numerical simulation model. Icing is a well-known natural phenomenon where the surface water turns into ice or frost due to freezing conditions. This can occur on infrastructure such as power transmission lines and is affected by factors including meteorology, thermodynamics, heat transfer, and hydrodynamics, as well as the local weather, terrain, and the transmission line's surface conditions.

Given that extreme ice events can cause significant issues, various de-icing technologies have been developed and implemented with varying levels of success. Some, like the electric pulse de-icing method, encounter operational challenges over long distances due to limitations in the available excitation sources.

One approach to de-icing involves converting electrical energy into heat, which requires calculating the necessary current and duration for the de-icing process. Various models exist for this purpose, and previous research starting from the 1980s has focused on identifying and modeling different factors that influence icing, including wind, temperature, humidity, altitude, and the physical characteristics of the power lines.

In this paper, the authors extend previous models by investigating how electrical current affects ice formation. They explore the changes in the critical current—defined as the minimum current required to prevent icing—under varying weather conditions and changes in the physical parameters of the aerial cables. By understanding these changes, strategies can be developed to manage icing using controlled current distribution in the power grid, especially in areas prone to icing.

Observations have shown that ice formation varies even under identical climate conditions, depending on the load the line carries. Lines with heavier electrical loads tend to have less icing or no icing at all, while lines with no load have more significant icing. This variance is attributed to the Joule heating effect, which alters the surface temperature of the conductor and, consequently, the icing conditions.

Critical current values are influenced by several factors including wind speed, ambient temperature, atmospheric pressure, conductor geometry and resistance, and surface emissivity. By using critical current values to prevent icing, operators can adjust the load distribution on the grid and preemptively increase the load on typically underused lines or ensure peak power plants generate enough electricity to keep the current above the critical value through the analysis of local weather and terrain.

The paper presents rules that define how the critical current changes with external meteorological conditions and conductor parameters, providing a sample calculation for a scenario where the current is below the critical level for preventing icing. Notably, it finds that as the conductor diameter increases, the critical current also increases. However, this relationship isn't directly proportional; rather, it's found to be a linear, non-proportional relationship, indicated by a straight-line fit that doesn't pass through the origin.
