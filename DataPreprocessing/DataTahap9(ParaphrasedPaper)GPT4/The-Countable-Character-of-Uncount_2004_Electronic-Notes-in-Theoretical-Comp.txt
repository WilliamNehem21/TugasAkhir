This paper highlights an intriguing discrepancy between finite and infinite cases in its findings. While the paper presents results that only apply to the infinite case, the same results remain unproven for the finite case and exist in the realm of conjecture as indicated by Devos, Johnson, and Seymour. Specifically, even though in the realm of the infinite (where sets A and B are without bounds), the proposition is considered a weaker form of Proposition 4.8.

Furthermore, the paper discusses the concept of a bond within a graph, which is defined as a non-empty cut that is also minimal in terms of inclusionâ€”essentially, a minimal separator. For a connected graph G, a cut denoted as [A, A^c]_G (where A^c is the complement of A) qualifies as a bond if and only if both resulting subgraphs induced by A and A^c are themselves connected. This definition is not influenced by the cardinality of the sets involved, which could be odd or even.
