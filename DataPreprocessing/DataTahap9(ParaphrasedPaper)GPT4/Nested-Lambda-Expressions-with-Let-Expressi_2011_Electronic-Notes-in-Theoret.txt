The use of template metaprograms in C++ applications is on the rise, either directly or through the adoption of libraries that utilize them. Since template metaprogramming in C++ aligns with functional programming principles, it's beneficial for C++ developers to have access to functional programming techniques. Functional languages often employ 'let' expressions to bind values locally within a scope, streamlining the code by reducing repetition and preventing namespace clutter. This paper introduces a way to incorporate 'let' expressions into C++ template metaprogramming and demonstrates their use in creating lambda expressions.

C++ template metaprograms are inherently functional but suffer from complex syntax, making them challenging to write and read. Template metafunctions in these programs sometimes require repeated sub-expressions, leading to either code duplication or the creation of additional metafunctions, which can clutter the namespace. Introducing local bindings for expressions within metafunctions could simplify both the writing and maintenance of C++ template metaprograms.

Although the Boost Metaprogramming Library enables the creation of lambda expressions for compile-time execution, issues arise with nesting these lambda expressions. The paper proposes a solution to this problem, utilizing 'let' expressions to support correctly implemented nested lambdas. An accompanying library based on this approach is available.

The paper is organized as follows: the concept of 'let' expressions is explained in section 2, section 3 outlines how to integrate 'let' expressions into languages without inherent support, section 4 illustrates the implementation of nested lambda expressions using our method, section 5 discusses the extension to recursive 'let' expressions, and future research directions are considered in section 6. The conclusions are summarized in section 7.

The paper asserts that, although functional languages typically have native support for 'let' expressions, C++ does not, as template metaprogramming was not an intentional feature at the language's inception. Despite this, 'let' expressions can be implemented with standard C++ capabilities. The document underscores the utility of lambda functions for creating compact functors within code, although they are nameless unless assigned to a variable.

A class is defined, working as a metafunction, which takes the name of an argument and the lambda expression's body to bind arguments locally when applied. While the paper leaves the handling of multiple arguments for future research, it demonstrates the technique with an example.

In summary, the paper illustrates that 'let' expressions, common in many functional languages, can be integrated into C++ template metaprogramming, despite its lack of built-in language support for them. Additionally, it shows how they can facilitate the inclusion of lambda expressions. The authors have developed a library that provides support for both 'let' and lambda expressions in C++ template metaprogramming, suggesting significant enhancements over the existing Boost Metaprogramming Library, particularly in managing nested lambda expressions.
