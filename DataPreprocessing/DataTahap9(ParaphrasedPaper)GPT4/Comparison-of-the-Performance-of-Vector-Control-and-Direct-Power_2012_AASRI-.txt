The traditional method for independently managing the active and reactive power produced by an electrical machine involves a stator flux-oriented vector control technique, which relies on sensors to determine the rotor's position. This system's effectiveness hinges on two factors: the precision with which the stator flux is calculated and the accuracy of the rotor position data provided by a position encoder. This setup is particularly challenging to align in machines with a doubly-fed wound rotor.

On the other hand, the direct power control method for doubly fed induction generators offers a way to regulate the active and reactive power output of a wound rotor induction generator without using rotor position sensors. This approach enables separate control over the active and reactive power of the stator, and it has demonstrated a strong dynamic performance in simulations. Due to its reliance on stator-side voltage and current measurements, this technique is not affected by variations in the machine's parameters, giving it an edge over vector control methods. Specifically, direct power control has shown advantages in terms of faster settling times and reduced peak overshoot compared to vector control.

Moreover, direct power control technology has been successfully integrated with an optimal power controller designed for maximizing energy capture in wind energy systems. Additionally, a pitch angle control mechanism has been applied to wind turbines to prevent the generator's speed from exceeding its maximum limit under high-wind conditions, ensuring the system operates effectively even when wind speeds increase.
