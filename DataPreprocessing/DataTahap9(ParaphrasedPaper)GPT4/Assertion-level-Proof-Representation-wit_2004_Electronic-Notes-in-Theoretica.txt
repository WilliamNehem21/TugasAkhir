This academic paper discusses a novel approach to representing proofs in a way that is comprehensible to humans, particularly within the context of tutorial dialogue systems. It addresses the challenge of reconciling human-oriented proofs, which may include under-specification and are developed for use within a proof manager of tutorial dialogue systems, with more detailed, calculus-driven, and machine-oriented formats employed by domain reasoners.

The research builds upon empirical findings from the DIALOG project at Saarland University, where human subjects and a tutorial system collaborated to construct proofs in naive set theory. These experimental activities yielded a corpus of proofs that revealed key differences, such as varying levels of granularity and under-specification, common to human-constructed proofs.

Under-specification within this context borrows from computational linguistics and refers to deliberately leaving out certain proof elements to be addressed later when more information is available. This concept is crucial in the design of user interfaces for theorem provers, advocating a clear distinction between user-friendly proof representations and the machine-oriented formats internal to the system.

The paper highlights the importance of developing data structures and interpretation components that interact with the user in natural language and enable formal representation of proofs. The focus is on naive set theory initially, with intentions to explore more complex mathematical areas later.

Challenges identified include determining the completeness, correctness, granularity, and relevance of a proof step. These are essential in a tutorial context, where the system must decide whether to accept a student's proof step. The authors propose representing each proof step as hypothetical and potentially under-specified within a suitable proof representation format to facilitate analysis.

Additionally, the paper delves into assessing proof steps for accuracy, relevance, and the incorporation of domain-specific reasoning techniques to aid in determining the relevance of proofs. It acknowledges the existence of strategy-dependent lemmata and the notion that while the underlying calculus may be theoretically complete, the practical strategies employed may not be.

The work underscores the complexity of confirming the validity of a proof step while also questioning its necessity based on the student's response. It suggests the need for further research, particularly in developing comprehensive strategies that ensure all relevant aspects of a proof are considered and properly referenced.

In summary, this paper proposes a human-oriented approach to representing mathematical proofs, with a focus on accommodating the under-specification often found in human reasoning, aiming to enhance the design of interfaces for theorem provers and improve educational dialogue systems.
