In the multiple-error scenario, the complexity increases significantly due to the impact of error positions and the specifics of the circuit configuration. This complexity results in vastly different outcomes, ranging from the best case scenario, where errors occur independently, to the worst case scenario, where severe error masking can occur. To gain a deeper understanding of the typical outcomes when multiple errors are present, numerical simulations have been employed. The results from these simulations suggest that the probability of undetected errors is typically near the lower end of the spectrum, indicative of a 'best-case' scenario.

It's noteworthy that a comparable approach has been recently discussed in the realm of quantum computing, which shares many similarities with reversible circuits. Specifically, a validation strategy that heavily relies on simulations has been proposed and further refined in the quantum computing field. Similar theoretical findings have been discussed in this context as well.
