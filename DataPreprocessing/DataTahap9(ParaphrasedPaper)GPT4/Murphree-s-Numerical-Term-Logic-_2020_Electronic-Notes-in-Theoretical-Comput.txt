Beyond the two primary structures discussed, we also need to consider two specific scenarios. Initially, let's explore the fundamental types for our baseline scenario. For the first type, we assign n and m to be zero. For the second type, we set n as zero and m as one. Consequently, the Normal Tree Logic (NTL) becomes indistinguishable from the Tree Form Logic (TFL), resulting in perfectly complete trees within TFL. Moving on to the inductive scenario, we select n equal to k and m equal to j. This substitution remains a legitimate inference in NTL, as it continues to fulfill the requirements for a correct deduction within NTL. Now, if we assume that each type holds true in NTL for n equal to k plus 1 and m equal to j plus 1, where k and j are greater than zero, then the trees in question would be structured accordingly.
