We present a new process calculus named DBSPI, specifically tailored for representing Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs). This calculus integrates cryptographic broadcasts within a framework that allows for the modeling of node locations and their mobility. Unique to DBSPI is that communication and movement of nodes is limited to nearby devices within a defined "neighborhood," which can dynamically change through the use of bound identifiers within the calculusâ€™s syntax.

MANETs are self-configuring networks where devices double as routers and servers, eliminating the need for centralized infrastructure. These devices face specific challenges in the context of protocol development due to their mobility and limited communication range. For instance, the protocols must support route discovery and multi-hop connections while adjusting to frequently changing network topologies. Furthermore, reliability and security remain critical, but traditional attacker models like the Dolev-Yao model may be too robust due to the localized nature of transmissions in MANETs.

Our calculus allows for the analysis of protocol authenticity when cryptographic methods are employed in MANETs. We offer a flexible attacker model tailored to the strength required by the user. This model ranges from attackers that are restricted to local communication to those with network-wide access.

We take Mobile IP registration as an example, where a mobile device maintains a consistent IP address across different network access points. In the MANET context, communication via Mobile IP involves routing through a foreign agent and a home agent, which facilitate connectivity between the mobile device and the internet.

DBSPI builds upon previous works like those by Sangiorgi and Mezzetti, who explore wireless systems, and Merro, who omits cryptography in his calculus. Our work places emphasis on abstracting away collision problems and employing a verification approach to approximate the outcomes of a given protocol.

DBSPI includes constructs for local message binding, provides a method for process migration which enables joining and splitting of MANET nodes, and supports dynamic neighborhood extension by binding identifiers via input prefixes. Messages are composed through a syntax that encompasses names, tuples, and cryptographic operations.

Safety is addressed through the concept of "robust safety," where we tailor the Dolev-Yao attacker model to fit MANET specifications. We also utilize a typed system incorporating notions of observational effects within the protocol, allowing for verification that messages are correctly paired with their respective protocol points. This typing system covers various operations like key generation and encryption, both symmetric and asymmetric.

Our work contributes a novel tool for analyzing and ensuring the safety of cryptographic protocols within MANETs and provides a basis for comparing the expressive capabilities of DBSPI with other calculi, such as CMAN, especially in scenarios involving fixed neighbor topologies and bi-directional relationships.
