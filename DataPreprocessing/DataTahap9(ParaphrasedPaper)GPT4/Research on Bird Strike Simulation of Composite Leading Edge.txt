The academic paper discusses the interaction between aircraft and birds during high-speed collisions known as bird strikes, which can cause significant damage to an aircraft and pose a safety risk. To mitigate these risks and enhance aircraft design, anti-bird strike considerations are incorporated in the early design stages. The paper describes the use of simulations to help optimize aircraft structures while reducing costs and shortening design timelines.

Key aircraft components, such as the leading edge skins, front and rear spars, and the internal framework of the aircraft's tail, are constructed using composite materials of varying thickness. These skins incorporate honeycomb sandwich material for reinforcement, and the spars are connected using titanium alloys with riveted joints. 

The paper reflects on a simulation conducted according to HB7084-94 standards to test anti-bird strike capabilities of the tail structure. The test involves a bird model weighing 3.6 kg and shaped like a cylinder with hemispherical ends, with a diameter of 18 cm, impacting the aircraft's vertical tail at 114 m/s. The interaction, though extremely brief (milliseconds), is calculated over a 10 ms duration.

Simulation models must accurately represent the physical contact between the bird and the aircraft's structure. This is accomplished by using a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) model for the bird and traditional Lagrangian elements for the tail structure, with an asymmetric contact defined in PAM-CRASH software where the bird is the 'slave' and the leading edge is the 'master' in the contact.

Results from the simulation show that the bird, being softer, deforms and breaks apart upon hitting the leading edge. The bird's body is split into three parts, with the bulk of the mass continuing into the wing box, striking the front spar. The impact causes the leading edge to cave in and damage to the third diaphragm. The bird penetrates the leading edge, creating a cavity.

Damage patterns differ between components: the leading edge skins and front spar sustain bending shear injuries due to compression and bending forces, while internal structures such as the third diaphragm suffer from pressure-induced instability.

The impact leads to partial breakage of the thickened leading edge. However, the dispersal of the remaining bird mass minimizes further damage. After optimization, the leading edge thickness is 3.653 mm and the structure's weight has increased by 2.957 kg.

Overall, the study confirms that composite materials and honeycomb reinforcement within the vertical tail leading edge effectively absorb impact energy, reducing the speed of the disintegrating bird from 114 m/s to 90 m/s, thereby enhancing aircraft safety during bird strikes.
