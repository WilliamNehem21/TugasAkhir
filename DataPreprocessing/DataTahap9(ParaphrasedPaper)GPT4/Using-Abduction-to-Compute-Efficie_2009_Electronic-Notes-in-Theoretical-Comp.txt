In a given academic context, where there is a branch with elements t a1, ..., tan, fb1, ..., fbm, a rule called a branch expansion step can be applied if the conditions or premises required by the rule exist within the branch. Once these conditions are met, the rule's conclusions can be appended to the branch. Additionally, there is a rule called pb branching that divides a single branch into two separate branches.
