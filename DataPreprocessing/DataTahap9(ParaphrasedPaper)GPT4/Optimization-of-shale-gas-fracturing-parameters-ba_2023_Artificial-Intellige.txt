This paper describes a comprehensive approach for optimizing hydraulic fracturing parameters in shale gas wells, leveraging the synergies between reservoir numerical simulation and machine learning. The focus is on the Fuling marine Longmaxi formation, where a single-well geological model is created in CMG software. To accommodate variable formation characteristics, completion techniques, and fracturing parameters, 10,000 diverse reservoir models were generated using Monte Carlo simulation and then numerically simulated. A dataset comprising these model parameters and production curves was compiled and analyzed using various machine learning regression algorithms, including linear regression, support vector machines, decision trees, gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), and random forest.

The GBDT algorithm emerged as the optimal method with an R2 value of 0.96, indicating high accuracy in predicting shale gas production. A Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) workflow was integrated with the GBDT production prediction model, enabling rapid optimization of fracturing parameters under varying geological conditions by aiming for maximum cumulative gas production. 

The study acknowledges that while machine learning applications in shale gas optimization are promising, they often face challenges like limited data points, overfitting due to small datasets, and reduced prediction accuracy due to idealized modeling. To counter these issues, a substantial dataset was created using Monte Carlo simulation, allowing for more robust machine learning processes and offering accurate predictive performance free from overfitting. The adoption of PSO in conjunction with the GBDT model significantly enhances the efficiency of parameter optimization, offering a powerful toolkit for maximizing shale gas extraction.
