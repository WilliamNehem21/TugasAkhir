The academic paper discusses the integration of lazy rewriting techniques into proof assistants like Coq, which involve a particular transformation process called "thunkification." Thunkification simulates lazy rewriting within innermost rewriting but requires terms to adhere to certain rules, like not having non-variable subterms in certain positions. When Coq and ELAN interact, they must use the same canonical Term Rewriting System (TRS), with ELAN performing proof searches and Coq verifying the proofsâ€”especially emphasizing that ELAN should generate the most concise proof traces to reduce verification time in Coq. 

The cost of finding a redex is dependent on the size of the terms, which can be substantial, so efficiency is key. Lazy rewriting only rewrites active subterms (in head normal form), while lazy subterms may remain unchanged, sometimes containing reducible but possibly non-terminating reductions. The paper differentiates between active and lazy subterms and discusses decorations that denote active and lazy terms within the rewriting process.

Developed algorithms ensure that lazy rewriting is correctly simulated by innermost rewriting, addressing concerns about termination and soundness. This includes the condition that non-variable terms should not be used as lazy arguments in function symbols. The authors deal with potential issues by transforming larger TRS into minimal ones, which may introduce numerous simple rules and function symbols, but simplify pattern matching.

Rewrite rules and the concept of left-linearity within TRSs are clarified, with labels identifying unique rules. The discussion moves into more detailed technical aspects of the rewriting process, including positioning and active/lazy subterm identification and transformation. Importantly, the thunkification process used to simulate lazy rewriting in a transformed system is explained, ensuring that the correct normal form is preserved, and that lazy arguments are managed properly.

The paper establishes the foundations for a transformation that eliminates non-variable, potentially problematic lazy argument subterms, enabling a cleaner transformation process. It also touches on the challenges of non-variable lazy subterms within rule left-hand sides, offering solutions that enable a correct simulation of lazy rewriting using thunkification. Finally, the paper concludes with a summary of how the lazy rewriting technique, combined with the thunkification method, enables more efficient proof searches and verifications within proof assistants.
