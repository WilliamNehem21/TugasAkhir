Waterpipe smoking is a widely prevalent form of tobacco use, especially among the youth, and contributes to over 5 million deaths annually. Common forms of tobacco consumption include cigarettes, cigars, and waterpipes, often known as shisha or narghile. Waterpipes are perceived by many as a safer alternative to cigarettes, despite the potential for occasional use to cause tissue inflammation.

Chronic consumption of tobacco is linked to cognitive impairments, including reductions in cognitive flexibility, learning, memory processing speed, working memory, and overall brain health, leading to atrophy and increased risk of neurodegenerative diseases.

In a study conducted in Cairo, Egypt, researchers used carob pods from local herbal markets to create an aqueous extract using a rotary evaporator. Rats received the extract orally at a dose of 600 mg/kg body weight. Two experimental groups were treated with either a protective regimen, receiving carob extract before waterpipe smoke exposure, or a therapeutic regimen, receiving the extract after smoke exposure, each for a duration of 8 weeks.

This study involved biochemical assays, including the determination of nitric oxide (NO) levels in lung tissue and the measurement of antioxidants such as catalase (CAT). Inflammation markers such as myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and hydroxyproline content in the lungs were also investigated.

Results showed that waterpipe smokers experienced increases in cough and various biological abnormalities within the lung. It was proposed that the increase of dopamine (DA) in the brainstem and cerebral cortex following waterpipe smoke exposure may be due to augmented synthesis from its precursor, L-DOPA.

Contrarily, carob was shown to exhibit medicinal properties including anti-coughing effects potentially due to a reduction in DA through a decrease in L-DOPA. Carob's antidepressant qualities were highlighted alongside its capacity to modulate neurotransmitters like serotonin (5-HT).

Amiodarone was used as a model for pulmonary toxicity, and its administration, alongside waterpipe smoke exposure, resulted in increased lung MPO activity and hydroxyproline content, indicating inflammation and collagen production in response to oxidative stress. Nicotine and heavy metals present in waterpipe smoke were implicated in oxidative damage to biological macromolecules.

The study suggested that carob pod extract significantly increased CAT activity without impacting other parameters, providing protection and improvement to the effects of waterpipe smoke exposure. Carob's antioxidant properties and nutritional value were emphasized, promoting its inclusion in healthy food products.

The study concludes by highlighting the risks of waterpipe smoke, comparable to the known lung toxin amiodarone, and advocates for public health initiatives to educate and regulate waterpipe smoking. The protective and therapeutic potentials of carob are underscored due to its antioxidant capacity and its role in preventing diseases.
