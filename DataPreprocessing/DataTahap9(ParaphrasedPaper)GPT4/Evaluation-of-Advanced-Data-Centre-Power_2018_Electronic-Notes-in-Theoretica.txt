The academic paper discusses how power management (PM) in data centers is crucial for reducing energy consumption and maintaining performance. It highlights that aligning power consumption with utilization, known as power proportionality, is a key focus for boosting energy efficiency. As PM technologies have improved, the ability to dynamically adjust server power states has become more sophisticated.

The paper introduces a new evaluation method that integrates a PM module into a data center simulation framework using AnyLogic software. This module enhances the PM capabilities by allowing for the specification of various strategies and considers a range of state information variables to enable the creation of advanced PM strategies that are energy-efficient while meeting service-level agreements (SLAs).

The authors describe their method using an existing data center simulation framework, focusing on how the frameworkâ€™s dynamic PM extension can strategically control server power state transitions based on various observable metrics. They then discuss an existing specification for dynamic PM strategies within the simulation framework.

Efficiency in PM strategies is evaluated by how well they meet both performance and energy goals. This often involves measuring performance per watt (PPW), which seeks to balance the trade-off between power usage and performance, with the aim of both minimizing power consumption and improving response times. One practical approach to satisfying SLAs is to monitor response time thresholds, estimating the percentage of jobs that breach SLA requirements based on the number of violations.

The paper also considers the total number of power state transitions during a simulation, presenting a formula that excludes switches during adaptation periods to provide a clearer view of power state switching frequency in a stable system.

In summary, the paper explores methods for improving power management in data centers through the use of advanced strategies that are informed by a wide array of system state variables and validated using a simulation framework. The goal is to achieve high energy efficiency while adhering to performance targets and meeting SLA standards.
