This paper discusses a new technique to clean up electrocardiogram (ECG) signals from unwanted noise, specifically power line interference, and accurately identify crucial signal peaks such as the R peak, which is essential for diagnosing heart conditions. Traditional morphological filtering methods tended to erase important ECG information while removing noise, but the new method in this paper claims to avoid that issue.

Mathematical morphology (MM), a mathematical framework involving set theory, topology, and random functions, forms the basis of the proposed technique. It uses concepts called structuring elements that can have various shapes (e.g., points, lines, circles) and two primary operations called erosion and dilation, from which other operations like opening and closing are derived. These operations are applied to a noisy ECG signal, using a specific triangular structuring element, to eliminate noise while preserving the signal's peaks and valleys, particularly in the QRS complex, which includes the R peak.

The paper's authors tested their new method with real ECG data collected at a 300Hz sample rate, contaminated with 60Hz noise to simulate power line interference, and then assessed its performance using signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) metrics.

Their novel de-noising approach combines morphological operations with an adaptive filter using the least mean squares (LMS) algorithm. This dual technique successfully reduces noise, preserves the R peaks in the ECG signals, and subsequently allows for the extraction of the QRS wave. This extraction supports the real-time analysis of the R-R interval, useful for patient monitoring during surgery.

However, the paper acknowledges that choosing appropriate structuring elements to tailor to individual patient differences remains a challenge and an area for future research.
