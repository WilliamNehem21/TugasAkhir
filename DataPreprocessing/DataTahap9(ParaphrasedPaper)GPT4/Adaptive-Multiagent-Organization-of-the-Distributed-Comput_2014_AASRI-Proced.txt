The utilization of consumer-grade computer networks (CNS) in distributed computing systems (DCS) presents a primary challenge due to the likelihood of abrupt changes in their capabilities, such as processing power and network bandwidth. These fluctuations occur as CNS owners engage in various activities, like launching applications or downloading files. Additionally, the diversity of CNS across different owners complicates the already-difficult task of efficient task distribution within a DCS.

One attempt at harnessing such distributed resources is the SETI@Home project, which employs volunteerâ€™s CNS to analyze radio telescope signals in search of extraterrestrial life. Despite this, SETI@Home is limited in application as it is only suited for tasks that are easily partitioned into independent pieces. This design allows for simple implementation of load balancing and is not affected by time-sensitive operations, accommodating the variable performance of individual CNS. However, these characteristics also restrict SETI@Home's utility for more complex tasks.

To address coherent and time-sensitive task execution in DCS, a new approach is proposed where agents within the system form adaptable communities based on their current performance to manage dynamic changes in CNS parameters.

The core aim of this research is to empirically validate the effectiveness of these new methods and algorithms. Additionally, there is a desire to assess the potential loss of processing time on CNS due to the management processes involved in decentralized computing. To achieve this, a series of experiments were conducted with varying CNS and network parameters, applying real-world tasks the researchers encounter at Southern Federal University.
