This research investigated the protective properties of Gingko biloba extract (GBE) and melatonin (MEL) against Bisphenol A (BPA)-induced liver and kidney damage in adult male rats. The study found that BPA significantly raised plasma levels of liver damage markers AST and ALT. However, co-administration of GBE, MEL, or both, reduced these plasma enzyme activities, suggesting a therapeutic effect against BPA toxicity.

BPA exposure resulted in oxidative stress by increasing lipid peroxidation (measured by TBARS levels) and depleting glutathione (GSH) in the liver. Additionally, the specific activities of antioxidant enzymes like glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the liver were reduced by BPA. However, co-treatments with GBE and/or MEL increased the hepatic activities of these antioxidant enzymes, suggesting that these natural substances mitigate oxidative damage.

BPA also induced kidney damage, evidenced by increased blood urea and creatinine levels. Treatments with GBE, MEL, or both helped in significantly reducing these levels, indicating their potential to alleviate BPA-induced nephrotoxicity. The natural compounds improved enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants, reduced lipid peroxidation, and diminished the inflammatory response in the liver and kidney, confirmed by histopathological analysis.

The research concluded that widespread BPA usage poses health risks but highlighted GBE and MEL as potential remedies for their antioxidant capacities. Thus, these substances might offer health benefits in shielding against the detrimental effects of BPA.
