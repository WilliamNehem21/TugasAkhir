The structure of this paper is set out in the following manner. Section 2 details the methodology we suggest. Section 3 provides a comparison of empirical outcomes derived from both our method and other approaches, ensuring an equitable assessment. The paper concludes with final thoughts in Section 4.

From the experimental data, the leftmost portion of the grayscale demonstrates the superiority of our method, boasting the highest PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and the lowest MSE (Mean Squared Error) and AMBE (Absolute Mean Brightness Error) measurements. Additionally, a trend is noticed where PSNR drops and both MSE and AMBE increase as one moves rightward from the grayscale's left side.
