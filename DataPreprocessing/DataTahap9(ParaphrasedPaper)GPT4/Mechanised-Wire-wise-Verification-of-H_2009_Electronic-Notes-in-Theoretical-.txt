This paper discusses the process of transforming Handel-C programs into hardware component netlists, a technique extensively employed in commercial applications but lacking formal verification. The authors present an adapted semantic model for Handel-C compilation that is suitable for formal proofs and detailed analysis of the hardware's properties. The paper demonstrates the model's effectiveness by proving the accuracy of the hardware wiring schema and its ability to transmit control signals amongst components. To facilitate mechanical proofs, the authors discuss the model's implementation and proof verification within the HOL theorem prover.

The hardware model accounts for circuits with feedback connections by emulating their behavior through successive syntactic iterations. This approach addresses the challenge of potentially infinite traces, precluding an explicit semantic definition, especially considering the goal of mechanical verification.

The paper abbreviates "mixed" and "combin" as mnemonics for specific constructors in the Handel-C language. It specifies that the semantics of the "delay" construct check for the "start" wire in the combinatory prelude, while its combinatory prologue sets the "finish" wire high, with its behavior defined as introducing a single clock cycle delay.

The handling of the "while" construct within the semantics involves rules for both outcomes of the condition evaluation. One rule addresses the scenario when the condition is false, which results in the termination of the "while" loop.

For the "output" construct, which contrasts with the "input," the semantics include a combinatory prelude that ensures the writer's presence and the readiness of the reader. Behaviorally, the "output" construct must assign the transmitted value to the correct channel.

The authors also tackle the challenge of evaluating a collection of actions and assertions within node sequences, where the original action and condition order is lost. They resolve this by noting that assertions and control flow decisions depend solely on the current memory values, and all variables maintain their values throughout the clock cycle. This condition allows for the combinatoric actions to be evaluated in parallel with assertions and control flow decisions at any time, as their assessment is not affected by one another.
