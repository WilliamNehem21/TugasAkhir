Summarization can be classified as single or multi-document depending on the number of source texts. Single document summarization condenses one text, while multi-document summarization aggregates several documents, posing a greater challenge due to the larger search space and the optimization needed to extract key sentences. The paper progresses as follows: Section 2 reviews global optimization in text summarization; Section 3 presents the extractive summarization model proposed; Section 4 discusses a cuckoo search (CS) based summarizer; Section 5 elaborates on the objective function calculations; Section 6 covers experiments and result analysis; and Section 7 concludes the paper. The results show CS outperforms other optimization algorithms.

Although cuckoo search (CS) optimizes biodiesel engine operation, its application in text summarization is limited. Recent studies have used CS for single document summarization, but this paper tests CS against other algorithms for multi-document summarization. The CS results are promising based on F-score comparison. The paper details the multi-document summarization process, starting from preprocessing documents to extracting the final summary. The CS algorithm simplifies to a single egg per nest, each representing one solution. A set of documents is processed into summaries, assessing their fitness, and updating the current best solutions based on their performance. The summaries are evaluated for content coverage, cohesion, and readability.

Experiments compare the proposed multi-document summarization system (MDSCSA) against other summarizers using DUC datasets, implemented in MATLAB, and analyzed with ROUGE scores. The paper acknowledges challenges with parameter control in the evolutionary CS algorithm and suggests future work on parameters and testing against other algorithms.
