This academic paper discusses a theoretical framework for understanding the limitations and capabilities of different physical theories, particularly quantum theories, in relation to information processing tasks such as bit commitment and teleportation. The framework is based on the concept of ordered linear spaces and how they define composite systems, which has implications for whether classical theories can be applied and the constraints on instant signaling between systems.

In this framework, the authors analyze the security of bit commitment protocols—a cryptographic scheme where one party commits to a choice that they cannot change later—indicating that nonclassical theories that do not have entanglement features can allow for highly secure bit commitment. They also explore the influence of entangled states on the security of these protocols, noting that the presence of specific types of entanglement can compromise the protocol that works for unentangled cases.

The authors detail additional research on teleportation—an information-processing task that involves transferring the state of a system from one location to another without physically transmitting the system itself. They present criteria that determine whether a composite system of three parts can conduct a conclusive teleportation protocol and include conditions for when teleportation can be deterministic.

The paper concludes with ideas on formulating a theory of information processing by beginning with an axiomatic approach to process categories, potentially using enriched categories over ordered linear spaces or abstract state spaces. This approach aims to link the conditions necessary for different protocols and properties drawn from the convex framework to other properties like compact closure and dagger compact closure. Discussions and early collaborative efforts with other researchers in the field inform these closing thoughts, pointing to the direction for further exploration within the categorical descriptions of information processing.
