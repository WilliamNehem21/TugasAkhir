In our Markovian framework, when a process term interacts with a test, the resulting transitions should all correspond to exponential distributions, meaning the rates of transitions are represented by positive real numbers. This requirement strongly relies on the chosen method of synchronization. To ensure all rates remain exponential, a Markovian generative-reactive form of communication is used. As a result, within the tests, only "passive actions" can take place. These passive actions don't have a timeframe; rather, they possess positive real values that serve as weights. These weights are utilized to probabilistically choose among multiple passive actions sharing the same label. Essentially, a process term up for testing offers up an action to be executed through a competitive process among the available actionsâ€”each of which is timed exponentially. Then, the test selects one of these actions, randomly choosing a passive action that matches the name of the suggested time-based action.
