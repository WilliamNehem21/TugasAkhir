Our survey of existing literature revealed no instances of image compression relying solely on the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). This is primarily because using DFT produces both real and imaginary coefficients, and preserving both is essential for accurate image reconstruction, which in turn limits compression potential. However, our study employed the DFT, coupled with a matrix-minimization algorithm as detailed in our paper, to compress images effectively while maintaining visual quality and reducing compression complexity. Our comparative analysis highlights the advantages of combining DFT with matrix minimization in terms of compression ratios, compared to using the DFT alone.

The research outlined here presents an innovative technique for compressing grayscale, color, and structured light images, which are commonly used in 3D reconstruction. This technique integrates the DFT with a matrix-minimization algorithm. The paper emphasizes the key features of this method and discusses how they contribute to achieving high-quality images with significant compression rates.
