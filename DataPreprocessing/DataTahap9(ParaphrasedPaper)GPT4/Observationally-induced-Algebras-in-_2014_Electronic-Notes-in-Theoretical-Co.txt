We explore the creation of computational monads using the free algebra approach based on observations within the realms of classical domain theory. Our study shows that the free algebra method can be applied to all algebraic signatures with finite arity, as well as various computational models. We also examine how classic powerdomain constructions fare under this observational approach. The established constructions of the Hoare, Smyth, and probabilistic powerdomains align with the observational method, but we encounter challenges when applying it to the Plotkin powerdomain. Specifically, using Heckmann's algebra A as the prototype does not yield the traditional Plotkin powerdomain as expected.

Furthermore, we look into the feasibility of reconstructing classical powerdomain structures using this observationally-induced framework. We focus on the Hoare, Smyth, and extended probabilistic powerdomains. Past research outlined in references [3,4] has discussed the Hoare and Smyth powerdomains within a topological context. As the same reasoning applies here, we omit detailed proofs, assuming that the reader can bridge the gaps by referring to the cited works. Regarding the extended probabilistic powerdomain, the necessary details can largely be derived from Tix's research, thus we provide only brief pointers for the proofs in this case.
