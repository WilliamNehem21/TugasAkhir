The subjectivity of software quality, particularly from the user's perspective, poses a challenge in quantifying it effectively. Despite this, it is critical to measure quality in user-oriented online platforms, such as e-commerce systems, to ensure user satisfaction and repeated visits. This academic paper outlines a model that utilizes meta-metrics to guide the selection and application of various metrics when assessing an e-commerce system.

Building on previous work, the authors present a comprehensive set of meta-metrics which serve as a framework to enhance the credibility and precision of the e-commerce system evaluation process while also reducing the potential for measurement bias, ultimately saving time and resources. The framework is not intended to rank metrics, but to advise which metrics are best suited to verify specific facets of an e-commerce system.

An emphasis on the significance of metrics within business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce highlights that high-quality service can lead to higher user retention rates. The paper advocates for the measurement of e-commerce system performance, which can inform business strategies and bolster system quality.

While prior research has yielded a plethora of web metrics, few are tailored specifically to e-commerce. The authors acknowledge existing work on web usability and broader web metrics but note the gap when it comes to e-commerce-specific metrics. The innovative use of meta-metrics to evaluate these external metrics fills this void, as internal metrics have typically been analyzed using measurement theory or empirical data.

Ten meta-metrics categorize the performance characteristics to evaluate e-commerce metrics effectively, without passing judgment on the metrics themselves. These categories provide a multi-faceted view of the measurement procedure, covering aspects from the uniformity of results across different users (Measurement Independence) to the cost and efficiency of metric implementation (Cost). The paper proposes both existing and new meta-metrics in their framework.

The authors further discuss that the choice of metrics can sometimes require a trade-off between the depth of evaluation and the speed or scope of the assessment process.

In conclusion, this research represents progress in understanding how metrics can quantitatively measure the quality of e-commerce systems, offering valuable insights for both evaluation professionals and software developers in their pursuit of more effective quality assessments in e-commerce environments.
