In their paper, the authors provide an overview of the Internet Protocol (IP) and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), as well as Mixed Intuitionistic Linear Logic. They outline how they employ this logic in specifying the interfaces for IP and TCP, highlighting the significance of linear operators within the axioms. Details of the data transfer mechanism of TCP are specified, and the verification process for confirming crucial attributes of IP and TCP is briefly discussed.

TCP and IP are critical components of the network communication stack, facilitating data transfer across nodes on the internet. IP manages the sending of data but does not ensure its arrival, whereas TCP operates on top of IP to ensure a reliable end-to-end connection with error correction between network entities.

The authorsâ€™ specification framework uses axioms based on linear operators to define valid state transitions within these network protocols. For IP, they apply commutative linear logic due to the potential reordering of data packets. In contrast, TCP requires a combination of commutative and non-commutative operators to maintain the correct order of data receipt.

In their TCP model, they introduce a boolean flag 'b' that becomes false upon reaching an end-of-stream (EOS) character, indicating a complete TCP session. They specify data reading operations at a destination 'd,' demonstrating how this transfers a fixed number of bytes from one memory space to another and detail functions for manipulating lists of data.

The IP protocol specification is not promising, given that messages can be altered, duplicated, or lost. Nevertheless, the specification implies at least that a message arriving at a node must have been sent from another, originating node. Despite potential corruption of the message, a correctly received header, as verified by checksum, indicates a message with an equivalent header was sent. A single sent datagram from 'a' to 'b' can result in the receipt of one or multiple messages with the correct headers at 'b,' though these messages do not spontaneously appear without originating from some sending node.
