The paper discusses the limitations of current systems biology models in addressing the role of spatial phenomena in cellular processes. These models lack the capability to represent and evaluate spatial aspects, which are becoming more critical due to advancements in experimental techniques. Spatial phenomena play a significant role in processes like mitosis and signaling pathways, as they are influenced by the positioning and movement of various cellular components.

The authors outline their modeling approach using temporal rules that govern how processes act and interact, alternating with rules that define transitions between time intervals. These rules ensure that transitions do not occur until all possible actions and interactions within a time interval have been executed. The model also incorporates communication between processes based on time and spatial constraints.

They specifically mention Euglena, a photosynthetic microorganism that exhibits phototaxis, moving towards or away from light depending on its intensity. The researchers created a simplified 2D model to study this behavior.

In the SpacePi formalism they employ, actions are associated with radii to simulate physical interactions like collisions and light absorption. Molecular motion is represented by random walk models for Brownian motion, but more complex movements can also be accounted for by considering internal and external forces.

Active transportation of molecules is described using "train processes" that alter their movement functions when interacting with "rail processes", simulating fast, energy-consuming movement along intracellular structures.

The authors also address the challenges of efficient computation for process interactions, drawing on concepts from real space process algebra to inform the movement and communication of processes in a spatial context.

Several available simulation packages offer individual-based spatial dynamics without differentiating between formal modeling and execution. Contrarily, SpacePi provides the flexibility of a formal process algebra framework, enabling a customizable level of abstraction and precise definition of movement functions for better analytical and conceptual clarity.

The paper suggests applying geometric and temporal coherence strategies, borrowed from computer graphics collision detection, to optimize the computational efficiency of determining collisions and interactions in simulations. This approach helps avoid unnecessary calculations by considering the size, position, and motion of objects.
