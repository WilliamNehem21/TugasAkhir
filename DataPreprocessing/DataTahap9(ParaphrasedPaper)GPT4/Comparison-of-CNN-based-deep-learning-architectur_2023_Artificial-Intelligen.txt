Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have revolutionized the process of detecting and identifying rice plant diseases by analyzing leaf imagery. Given the distinct visual features such as spots, discoloration, and irregular shapes present on diseased leaves, CNNs offer a powerful tool for analyzing pixel inconsistencies and identifying diseases. This research focuses on exploring the effectiveness of assorted CNN models like ResNet152V, Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks (SE-ResNeXt101), DenseNet121, and MobileNetV2, alongside transfer learning techniques and ensemble learning methods incorporating DenseNet121, EfficientNetB7, and Xception, in diagnosing rice leaf diseases.

The paper reviews existing deep learning models for disease detection in rice, emphasizing architectural differences in basic CNN networks and image processing technologies that have been previously applied. It also outlines the economic importance of rice and how diseases can negatively affect the livelihood of farmers, particularly in rice-centric regions like Bangladesh.

Several rice diseases and pests such as B. gladioli, rice hispa, leaf scald, leaf smut, sheath blight, and tungro virus are detailed, providing characteristic symptoms for each. The study aims to build a CNN-based model that surpasses current classification accuracy, leveraging CNN layers to learn hierarchical features for better image recognition.

The research evaluates several CNN architectures as detailed in the literature, such as DenseNet-121, known for its feature map concatenation, and MobileNetV2, optimized for mobile devices due to its inverted residual structure and depth-wise convolutions. The study suggests a potential for enhanced accuracy when applying transfer learning and ensemble techniques, which incorporate multiple models to counterbalance individual model errors for improved predictions.

The paper discusses the issues of overfitting, validation loss, and training loss, with strategies for dealing with imbalanced datasets like stratified sampling and oversampling. It also presents the results and the usefulness of CNN models like DenseNet121, InceptionV3, and others, as well as the gains from using ensemble networks and transfer learning strategies, ultimately aiming to create a user-friendly mobile application for farmers to detect and manage rice leaf diseases.

In conclusion, the study demonstrates that an ensemble model combining DenseNet121, EfficientNetB7, and Xception, with transfer learning, outperforms other CNN models, offering promising results for rice leaf disease classification. Future work will focus on developing an accessible interface to help farmers identify and address rice plant diseases.
