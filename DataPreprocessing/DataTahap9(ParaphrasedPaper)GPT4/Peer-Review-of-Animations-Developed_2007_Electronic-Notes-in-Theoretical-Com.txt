Over recent years, visualizations have garnered significant attention across various scientific domains. In the field of psychology, there has been a substantial body of research exploring the effectiveness of images and animations in enhancing learning. One intriguing area of study is the distinction between verbal and pictorial communication, notably how visual materials often provide more specific examples compared to the more abstract nature of verbal descriptions. For instance, every depiction of a triangle will represent a particular shape, and one cannot illustrate a universally applicable triangle. This raises questions about the efficacy of visual aids in learning and the capacity of learners to abstract general principles from specific examples.

Meanwhile, in computer science, advancements in visualizations have been remarkable, especially within computer graphics. Even standard personal computers can now produce near-photorealistic images in real-time, incorporating various lighting scenarios. Video games stand out as a key application of these graphical achievements. The evolution of virtual, augmented, and mixed reality technologies is anticipated to play a significant role in the future.

Moreover, program and algorithm visualization represents another component of computer science engagement with visual materials. This area includes algorithm animation for educational purposes and the visualization of complex (often legacy) software systems to elucidate the interconnections and dependencies of various code elements like modules and classes.

Historically, psychologists and computer scientists have conducted their research in isolation. Psychologists may be unaware of the latest advancements in computer science, while computer scientists tend to focus on technological developments, frequently overlooking the human elements of perception, cognition, and learning.

In our workshop's upcoming experiment, a key question is the selection of learning methods against which to measure the outcomes of the visualization techniques. In the past, studies have compared various levels of engagement, such as viewing vs. responding or changing versus constructing. Due to constraints on time and participant availability, our experiment will compare the effects of constructing animations with peer review to constructing animations without providing feedback. Two separate experiments will be conducted, with one group engaging in both animation construction and peer review and the other focusing solely on construction. The second experiment will reverse the roles of the two groups.
