The paper in question examines unconventional proof rules within hybrid logic through the lens of topological semantics, a framework more inclusive than the traditional Kripke semantics. The authors focus on a specific proof rule, called BG, and show that it does not consistently maintain validity across different topological spaces. They confirm that the BG rule only accurately characterizes those topological spaces that have an equivalent Kripke frame representation, known as Alexandroff spaces. However, because Alexandroff spaces are not generally considered to be a particularly compelling class of spaces, the BG rule is seen as somewhat arbitrary from a topological perspective.

The authors suggest that alternative versions of the rule could be considered, such as a modified BG rule (BG'), which works for certain topological spaces that do not fall within the Alexandroff category. Moreover, they highlight that even without the contentious BG rule, certain hybrid logics built with modal Sahlqvist formulas exhibit a complete correspondence with Kripke semanticsâ€”a fact that goes on to suggest the admissibility of the Name rule in these logics.

In a related discussion, the authors elucidate how topological semantics can extend to cover logics that surpass the confines of the traditionally known modal logic S4 domain. Regarding other semantics, like normal neighborhood or Scott-Montague semantics, the paper argues that their insights are also applicable, thus generalizing their results.

Additional contributions mentioned in the paper include a mention of results by other researchers, applauding work by Kudinov who demonstrated that certain difference logics are axiomatizable by specific formulas, and a completeness proof for hybrid languages without a global modality by Sano, which is pending publication.

Lastly, the authors acknowledge various individuals for their assistance and contributions to the paper, including the inability to present the paper in person at a workshop, and express gratitude to those who have supported their work.
