This academic paper examines the theoretical underpinnings of extracting computer programs from mathematical proofs, specifically how to ensure that extracted programs correctly represent the logic of the proofs. This process is especially concerned with programs related to structures defined through induction and coinduction. It analyzes a more sophisticated type of lambda calculus that can handle a wider range of type operations and function definitions through general recursion, rather than the traditional structural recursion and corecursion. The research extends to include any potential enhancements to the base theory of realizers linked to inductive and coinductive proofs.

The study differs from previous work by Reynolds, who focused on simpler types and used ordered spaces (cpo) to reconcile typed and untyped expressions within a certain version of the Programming Computable Functions (PCF) language. Unlike Reynolds, this research does not limit types to simpler base types or include subtyping, but instead works with arbitrary recursive types and uses an untyped model with typed abstraction to interpret terms.

The paper narrows its scope to a few select constructors â€” nil, pair, left, right, and in. These constructors serve particular purposes, such as modeling initial and final fixed points in types, and potentially the research findings could be adapted to work with other constructors beyond these specified few.
