The paper discusses a specific type of queuing model that incorporates server vacations, a concept that has been extensively researched in connection with production systems. In such models, the server can be temporarily deactivated and enters a vacation state with random duration when the system has no units to process. The server is reactivated when the number of units in the system exceeds a certain threshold, "n," or after a set time period, "t." Managers have integrated vacation periods within these models to simulate idle time for tasks such as preventive maintenance, managing priority jobs, recharging batteries, and security-related activities.

The paper provides two examples to illustrate the concept:

Example 1.3 describes the use of a vacation protocol in the context of PCS (Personal Communication Services) call-terminating control. This refers to how call-terminating setup messages are handled within a network or cell station to prevent loss of these messages, ensuring that calls can be successfully set up. In the station, messages queued in the paging channel are cycled forward to the wireless area, which represents the vacation state. Retrial phenomena in this case refer to resending setup messages when an expected response is not received.

Example 1.4 discusses scenarios like paging channel overload or targeted attacks on cellular networks. In the context of a CDMA network with 32 or 64 paging channel slots, the paging channel at a base station is modeled as a queuing system with "n+1" queues, where "n" represents the number of slots. Within this system, the vacation state is equated to processing slotted traffic, while other factors such as energy and retrial are not considered.

To simplify analysis, the authors of the paper suggest considering only active breakdowns, disregarding those that occur when the server is idle or off. This can be achieved by substituting service time distribution with a generalized service time (or completion time), which includes repair times.

An additional simplification strategy suggested in the paper is to use the Stochastic Decomposition Property (SDP). This property allows for the division of the model into familiar components—such as a FIFO (First In, First Out) queuing system—and additional terms representing other influences. The authors mention that Fuhrmann and Cooper have identified a broad class of queuing models that exhibit this property for queue size, and assert that such decomposition is indeed possible for models that include vacations and/or retrials.
