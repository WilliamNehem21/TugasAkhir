In their research, Das and colleagues developed a feature extraction technique using image binarization to improve content-based image retrieval and identification. The system was evaluated on two open-access datasets, featuring 3,688 images in total, and succeeded in reducing feature size to 12 regardless of image dimensions. The method was assessed using statistical measures of precision and recall, although misclassification of query images was noted as a drawback, potentially reducing retrieval performance compared to existing methods.

The method involves identifying similar textured and structured images by applying the F-ratio test, followed by the energy spectrum test. Images passing both tests are deemed similar; otherwise, they are considered different. The mean average precision score was used for performance verification.

Feng et al. introduced an image descriptor called Global Correlation Descriptor for consistent extraction of texture and color features, aiming to balance their influence on Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR). The descriptor incorporates structure element correlation and histogram statistics. The method's efficacy was validated using Corel-10K and Corel-5K datasets, with recall and precision as the metrics for efficiency.

Zeng presented an image retrieval system centered on a local structure descriptor, which integrates color, shape, and texture features. An accompanying feature extraction algorithm can derive a local structure histogram using this descriptor.

Madhavi and team proposed a method called image retrieval using interactive genetic algorithms to filter selective features from a large image collection to compare and retrieve similar images. This approach was tested on a dataset comprising 10,000 images.

Ali et al. combined Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF) with Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) for a CBIR approach. This integration harnessed the scalability and rotation robustness of SIFT with SURF's tolerance to illumination changes and was evaluated on several Corel datasets.

Genetic algorithms (GA), inspired by biological evolution, are employed to identify optimal solutions in large search spaces. Similarly, the Great Deluge algorithm, resembling hill-climbing under rising water levels, can be integrated with GA to enhance solution quality.

In the context of image retrieval, color features are vital but can be influenced by various external factors. This necessitates preprocessing steps for extracting color features, making them reliable despite such influences.

Shape feature extraction focuses on capturing characteristics of image shapes, with the goal of enabling efficient storage, transmission, comparison, and recognition. Extracted shape features should be invariant to rotation, translation, and scaling.

Preprocessing includes noise reduction with a median filter that preserves edges while mitigating noise. After preprocessing, the Canny edge detection method is used to identify edges for shape feature extraction, providing consistent numerical information about images regardless of object size, direction, and position.

For local search optimization, solutions undergo genetic operations and a GA generates offsprings through selection, crossover, and mutation. Local search algorithms like the Great Deluge Algorithm are then applied to refine the solutions from GA, enhancing the overall exploitation in the search process and potentially expediting GA convergence. The process iteratively updates the population of solutions until the stopping criterion is met.
