The selection of a cricket squad requires careful evaluation of a balance between batspersons, bowlers, and all-rounders, prioritizing a wicketkeeper with strong performance both behind the wickets and with the bat. Though fielding is important, batting and bowling skills are typically weighted more heavily in evaluations.

The greatest team on any given day can vary, with low-scoring teams occasionally defeating higher-scoring opponents. This unpredictability underscores the importance of considering the relative strengths of opponents in player assessments. For example, a player's performance against a robust opponent or the dismissal of a high-achieving batter should be weighted more heavily.

A model for predicting team composition has been developed, using classification and prediction techniques. It classifies cricketers into categories and can lead to poorly performing players being dropped from the squad. Feature optimization, critical for machine learning, reduces data noise and irrelevance, and selects only the most significant features to improve classification and reduce computational expense. This study employed metaheuristic algorithms, known for effectively solving optimization issues, inspired by natural behaviors such as those observed in schools of fish or colonies of ants where communication is key to finding the best solutions.

These forecasting models are not only useful for team and player improvement strategies but also enhance sports analysis during broadcasts and are often featured in TV news sports segments.

The remainder of the paper discusses prior research; data collection with descriptive statistics; methodology with machine learning approaches; research findings; and a summary of the research in the discussion and conclusion section.

Various methods for predicting player performance and team selection include the use of Naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, random forests, ant colony optimization, and genetic algorithms to assess and predict the potential of individual players and team compositions.

Web scraping is highlighted as a more efficient alternative to manual data collection. Data, including player performance metrics, is collected and processed before model creation. Different team selection methods and prediction accuracy rates are compared, with the current research achieving up to a 97% accuracy rate for player selection utilizing a hybrid of cuckoo search, particle swarm optimization, and support vector machine algorithms. This exceeds the previous maximum accuracy found in the literature.

The dataset used in this investigation split the data into 70% training and 30% testing to preserve the chronological order necessary for accurate sports predictions. Additionally, players' performance was observed to vary based on the innings, playing conditions, and whether the opponent was ranked as strong or weak.

The conclusion underscores the superiority of the new model, which outperforms existing methods, offering a more accurate approach for selecting a well-balanced team for one-day international cricket matches.
