This research introduces a new variant called Populational Public Announcement Logic (PPAL), which builds upon Public Announcement Logic (PAL) but focuses on knowledge within populations or groups rather than individual agents. PPAL utilizes fuzzy logic principles, aligning with applications where knowledge evolution within collective entities, rather than precise individuals, is of interest. This makes it particularly suited for scenarios where population or group definitions arise dynamically during analysis and knowledge representation. The model facilitates understanding complex scenarios, such as predicting voting behavior in light of emerging news, by simulating how information dissemination impacts the collective knowledge of groups.

In PPAL, the notion of individuals is abstracted to the size of the population represented. This approach aligns with the goal of understanding knowledge within communities without needing to model each person. Groups are essential in PPAL because announcements that convey information are targeted at subsets of the population, reflecting private communication and leading to a multiple-worlds representation where each population maintains its knowledge model.

The paper outlines the logical foundations of PPAL, including the properties of the fuzzy functions employed, allowing users to adopt different fuzzy semantics that fulfill these properties. Additionally, the authors have developed a Java library and a model checker to support PPAL, ensuring practical utility and ease of integration into existing workflows. The tools' source code is openly available on GitHub. PPAL is compared to probabilistic logics, highlighting its unique capacity to form new groups in response to announcements, thereby offering more refined and dynamic knowledge updates within a logic framework. The study confirms that PPAL is decidable and outlines potential applications in model checking, emphasizing its advantages in dynamically representing group knowledge without predefined agent specifications.
