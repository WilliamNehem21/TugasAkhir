An alternate strategy focuses on defining distance measures for processes or states. Specifically, Giacalone et al. and Desharnais et al. have proposed pseudometrics for states in probabilistic transition systems. In the context of Labelled Transition Systems (LTS), van Breugel introduces three methods for establishing behavioral pseudometrics, which quantify the likeness between states akin to bisimilarity. Within the realm of Quantitative Transition Systems (QTS), de Alfaro and colleagues have created a method for quantifying the difference between traces, and then extrapolating that measure to determine distances between states. Additionally, they put forward the concept of branching distance, an extension of bisimilarity that incorporates quantitative elements.
