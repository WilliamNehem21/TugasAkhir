In this academic paper, the author discusses the limitations of the Unified Modeling Language (UML) in how it specifies the dynamics of software systems and the relationships between different models. Although UML's meta-model defines the abstract syntax of its languages precisely, their dynamic semantics are only informally described using natural language. Additionally, the paper highlights the lack of precise descriptions regarding the semantic interconnections among different UML models, which leads to problems in effectively integrating these models.

To address these issues, the author introduces an abstract semantic domain called transformation systems, independent of UML. This domain provides a way to give formal semantics to the different modeling languages within UML. By interpreting UML languages in terms of transformation systems, the semantics of language constructs become precise, and the correspondence between different modeling techniques can be clearly defined.

The paper also explains how transformation systems are an extension of labeled transition systems, where both states and transitions are labeled, representing the dynamic behavior of a system. An innovative approach to handling individual and collective object states in transformation systems is presented, as well as how object references are modeled.

Furthermore, the author describes how inheritance relations are managed within the domain, through extensions of class data space signatures. The data space can be optimized by adding constraints or axioms to further refine the set of possible states and transitions. The mapping process from UML to the domain of transformation systems is also touched on, particularly how it can benefit from a systematic, incremental definition process that begins with kernel languages and builds up complexity over time.

The paper proposes transformation systems as a foundational semantic framework for UML that not only makes semantics explicit but also supports the integration of different models, object composition, and refinement. Although the paper does not explore notions of object composition and refinement in-depth, it acknowledges the potential for using transformation systems to clarify these concepts within UML.

Overall, the author argues for a transformation system approach as a powerful and flexible method to provide formal semantics to UML and to improve the precision and integration of software specifications. This would allow for enhanced consistency checks and a more comprehensive framework for integrating various software specification techniques.
