The academic paper describes an innovative design for a passive solar house aimed at addressing the challenges of extreme weather conditions in a high-altitude location (approximately 5300 meters above sea level). The region experiences severe cold with temperatures dropping below -40°C during the coldest month, over 330 days of frost per year, a deep frost line exceeding 3 meters, and strong winds exceeding class eight. The local residents have difficulties with access to liquid water for consumption and bathing, relying on melted ice for their needs.

To alleviate these difficulties, a passive solar house was constructed to the south of existing buildings. The solar house is 2.5 meters tall and designed with a 45-degree angled daylighting glass pane of 11.8 m² to capture maximum sunlight, considering the local latitude and low winter sun angles. Beneath this angled section is a vertical glass of 1.85 meters high and 7.42 m², providing additional light and warmth.

The solar house is divided into two sections by a Trombe wall: a heated space (the heat preservation room) and a bathroom. The Trombe wall facilitates heat distribution between the two areas. The daylighting glass, made of single-layer ordinary transparent glass with a 5 mm thickness and a 70% light transmission ratio, allows sunlight to directly enter the heat preservation room. To maximize thermal inertia, the solar house's east, west, and north walls incorporate heat storage materials and are constructed vertically in line with the pool's walls.

A 200mm thick concrete brick composes the south-facing Trombe wall, which is painted black to enhance heat absorption, and features two air vents for draught on both the upper and lower sections.

For hot water, a heat pipe vacuum tube solar energy water heater collector is the primary source, with an electrical heating system with a 2kW heater as a backup. The heat pipe vacuum tube's light area is 1.2 m². The water tank, having an effective volume of 150 liters, is situated at the top of the solar house, intentionally lacking insulation to increase its direct heating area.

Sensors are strategically placed to measure performance, with indoor temperature sensors mounted at a height of 1.5 meters from the ground in both the bathroom and heat preservation room. The outdoor temperature sensor is placed at the same height but shielded from direct sunlight and wind. Additionally, a solar radiation intensity instrument is positioned 1 meter above the ground outside the window for monitoring solar energy input.
