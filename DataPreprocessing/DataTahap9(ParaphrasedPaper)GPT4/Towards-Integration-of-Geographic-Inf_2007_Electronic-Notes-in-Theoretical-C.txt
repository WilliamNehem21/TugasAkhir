The paper discusses advancements in the development of technologies and devices designed to gather extensive information about the Earth, with GPS technology now prevalent across a variety of platforms like smartphones and automobiles. Geographic data is analyzed and cataloged in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) at varying levels of detail, often distributed across the web. This means when global information is needed across different systems—such as river data from Patagonia which may be split between systems—challenges arise. Notably, these GIS systems tend to be developed independently with their own terminologies leading to heterogeneity issues.

The paper specifically concentrates on semantic heterogeneity experienced during schema integration involving various information sources. Two key processes are involved in this semantic integration: semantic enrichment and mapping discovery. Semantic enrichment involves adding more details to describe the data to reconcile discrepancies, often through metadata or ontologies. Ontologies, which provide a domain-specific vocabulary and network of relationships, are particularly favored for addressing heterogeneity.

Mapping discovery, the focus of the paper, involves developing correspondences between different ontologies. This exploration has led to different strategies for semantic matching, where some approaches propose non-specific processes applicable to various systems, while others are tailored to geographic information.

The authors review existing literature on these approaches, describing tools like Prompt and Chimarea for ontology merging that heavily rely on concept naming or consider limited types of relationships. Other work suggests a combination of lexical measures and conceptual structures to match ontology elements, while some adopt logical representations of ontologies for data schema integration. The paper also compares its method to existing proposals, identifying similarities and differences.

The proposed architecture and integration process for combining geographic sources involve local autonomous GIS as well as formal ontologies represented by description logic (DL) over frame-based logic (Flogic) due to DL's advantages. The integration process consists of a non-logic phase, handling syntactic and structural comparisons, and a logic phase using a reasoning system for analyzing subsumption relations and consistency checks.

The case study presented highlights that the proposed method not only considers hierarchical relationships but also more detailed properties within the ontologies. In conclusion, the authors propose a unique integration approach that combines two complementary processes to capture a broader range of properties in the semantic integration of geographic sources, potentially facilitating the construction of new integrated systems.
