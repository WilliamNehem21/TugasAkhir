Numerous studies have been published on artificial intelligence (AI) since the early works of Minsky (1961), Newell (1963), and others. In recent years, the petrophysics community has been incorporating AI and machine learning techniques to address challenges in petrophysical evaluation. Applications of AI in this field include carbonate characterization (Bigoni, 2019), log depth matching (Le, 2019), enhanced formation evaluation (Posenato-Garcia, 2020), and resistivity inversion (Li, 2019).

Technical difficulties such as thin-bedded sediments and remnant viscous oil, which could obstruct production tubing, have driven the use of AI. Identifying oil and gas zones was crucial to successfully produce dry gas; gas zones were targeted for perforation while oil zones were avoided.

A formation evaluation program was employed during drilling to gauge the presence of oil within the reservoir, utilizing core data, high-resolution electrical logs, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) tools to distinguish between high oil saturation zones and zones suitable for perforation. These findings were supported by the Modular Formation Dynamics Tester-Live Fluid Analyser (MDT-LFA) and borehole gas chromatography data.

AI was applied to interpret NMR curves, predicting fluid types in uncored reservoir sections and oil mobility, using calibration from dean and stark saturation measurements conducted on a one per foot basis in cored wells drilled with water-based mud.

Perforation strategies in development wells successfully prevented oil production during testing and enabled gas extraction from underlying sands. Details of such techniques are discussed by Cuddy (2004).

AI was also used in the North Sea to predict shear velocities in wells to aid reservoir modeling and future well drilling operations. The AI algorithm employed evolutionary principles to populate missing shear velocity data, and over time, the solutions were refined through mutation and mating to improve data across all wells.

AI has been beneficial in permeability estimation, a parameter crucial for well completion strategy and productivity. Unlike conventional methods, AI has provided better estimates of permeability, preserving the dynamic range and addressing the scale mismatch between well log resolutions and core plugs.

In the well log interpretation example, AI predictions replicating core permeability distribution were more accurate in capturing the range of permeability compared to linear regression, emphasizing the utility of AI in maintaining the fidelity of the original data for accurate reservoir modeling.

Steve Cuddy, a retired principal petrophysicist with a Ph.D. in petrophysics and 45 years of industry experience, has been recognized for his contributions, including AI software development and the fractal foil function for fluid distribution in reservoir modeling, with a distinguished service award from the SPWLA in 2018.
