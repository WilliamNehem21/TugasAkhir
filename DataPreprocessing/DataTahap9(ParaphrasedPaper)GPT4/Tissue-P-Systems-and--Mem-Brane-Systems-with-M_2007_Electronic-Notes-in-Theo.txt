The paper explores computation models based on membrane computing, specifically tissue P systems enhanced with mate and drip operations. These operations, historically used in membrane systems (or P systems), are adapted to work on strings within a cell-based model known as tissue P systems, expanding their computational capabilities.

For tissue P systems employing mate and drip operations, the study demonstrates that just two cells are needed to achieve computational completeness when processing strings. In other words, this minimal system is capable of performing any computation that a Turing machine could do, effectively making it a universal model of computation.

The paper also discusses a scattered context version of these systems, which allows for a similar level of computational power, albeit requiring up to four cells at any point during computation. Additionally, results analogous to those found for tissue P systems are confirmed for membrane systems, illustrating the applicability of these findings across different types of P systems.

The research builds upon existing work that combines the concept of objects located within membranes (as found in classical membrane systems) with the notion of objects on membranes (as seen in brane calculi). By applying this combined approach to tissue P systems with certain brane operations, the authors aim to push the boundaries of what these computational systems can do.

Tissue P systems are introduced, with a focus on those working with strings instead of multisets, stemming from the fact that such systems have a direct correspondence with those previously investigated and therefore can inherit computational completeness proofs from earlier works.

The paper provides some preliminary definitions before diving into detailed explanations of the tissue P systems with mate and drip operations. In the context of these systems, the mate operation fuses two cells into one, combining their contents, whereas the drip operation splits a single cell into two.

The paper concludes by posing open questions and providing additional remarks, suggesting that there is more to explore in this field of computational models inspired by the natural processes occurring within living cells.
