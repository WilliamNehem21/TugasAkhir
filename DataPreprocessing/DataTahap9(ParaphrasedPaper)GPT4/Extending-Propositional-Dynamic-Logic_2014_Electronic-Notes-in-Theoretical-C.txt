In this study, we introduce a new extension to Petri-PDL called DS3 Logic, designed specifically for the analysis of stochastic Petri nets, offering an alternative framework for assessing system performance using a compositional and structural methodology. We examine its logical foundation, as well as its properties of soundness, decidability, and completeness in relation to our defined semantics. Additionally, we demonstrate that the satisfiability (SAT) problem for DS3 Logic is EXPTIME-complete through a formal proof. An example application of DS3 Logic is also provided to illustrate its practical use.

We begin by outlining the theoretical and conceptual foundations that underpin our work in Section 2, comparing our approach to other existing methodologies. Section 3 delves into the technical details of Petri nets, setting the stage for our discussion in Section 4, where we introduce DS3 Logic and examine its fundamental properties, such as soundness, decidability, and completeness, in the context of our semantic framework. In Section 5, we provide a detailed explanation of the reduction of the two-person corridor tiling game. An illustrative example of how DS3 Logic can be applied is given in Section 6. Finally, we offer our concluding remarks and discuss directions for future research in Section 7.
