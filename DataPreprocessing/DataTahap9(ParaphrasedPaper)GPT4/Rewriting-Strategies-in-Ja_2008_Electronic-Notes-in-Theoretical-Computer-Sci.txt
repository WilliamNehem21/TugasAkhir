This academic paper discusses the synthesis of high-level strategic programming within the Java framework using a system called Tom. Tom is a language extension that enhances imperative languages with pattern matching characteristics, bridging the gap with functional programming languages. The paper highlights the conciseness and strong theoretical foundations of strategic rewriting systems, separating the notion of transformation rules from the strategies that govern their application. This separation allows for the clear definition of program transformations and precise control over their execution, aiding in ensuring aspects like correctness and termination.

Tom, as an extension, provides pattern matching directly related to object structures, which is highly beneficial for manipulating structured data such as trees, XML documents, and other hierarchical objects. From an implementation standpoint, Tom works as a compiler that takes various host languages and transforms matching constructs into the native language, with Java being a primary example.

Additionally, the paper introduces the Gom language, which offers a hook mechanism ensuring that objects, when constructed, are already in their canonical form, preserving invariants. It describes the integration of strategic programming techniques from other languages like OBJ, ELAN, Maude, and Stratego into Java, making use of the Visitor design pattern and bytecode specialization for efficient strategic rewriting.

The authors also present the integration of the "visitor combinator" design pattern with Tom, serving as an interpreter for strategic expressions. This is complemented by a compilation method based on bytecode specialization to increase efficiency, with these low-level transformations described in Tom itself.

Strategies in Tom are deployed using a variety of combinators. For example, the 'fwd' combinator dispatches calls to typed, structure-specific transformation methods to preserve types. The "evalconst" strategy illustrates the process of simplifying arithmetic operations with constants.

Tom's strategic programming framework facilitates transformations at the bytecode level, essential for optimizing Java programs and extending language features, such as in aspect-oriented programming. The paper also touches on the performance benefits of compiled strategies over visitor combinators in strategy efficiency, illustrating this with real-world applications like theorem proving and analyzing functional programs.

In conclusion, the paper showcases the use of Tom for program transformations and optimizations, emphasizing the potential for further improvements in loop invariant code motion and other efficiency-enhancing techniques. The strategic rewrite system emphasizes formal methods within the Java community by allowing for succinct rule definitions and controlled strategy applications.
