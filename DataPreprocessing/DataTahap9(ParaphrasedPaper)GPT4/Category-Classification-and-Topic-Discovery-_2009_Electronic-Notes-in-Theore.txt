This academic paper presents an approach to topic analysis in news, which includes determining both the topic and category of a news article. Categories represent broad classifications such as "sports" or "business" that help organize articles for easier access, while topics denote the main subject matter of an article. 

The paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 reviews background information and related studies. Section 3 details the methodology for categorizing articles. Section 4 outlines the algorithm for identifying and sorting articles by topic. Section 5 presents experimental outcomes, and Section 6 offers concluding thoughts and directions for future research.

Prior research has explored automated methods for detecting topics and clusters within document collections. This involves applying models to extract topics and groups from textual relationships, and it extends to unsupervised topic discovery via document clustering.

Unlike static categories, topics must be continuously identified, as they emerge from the unfolding news. To accommodate this dynamic nature, the paper discusses a process for both topic classification and topic discovery.

The topic classification algorithm relies on a keyword extraction process to measure the similarity between known topics and a new article. An article is then tentatively classified under the most closely related topic. If the similarity meets predefined thresholds, the classification becomes official. If not, the article becomes the first sample in a new topic category.

The approach emphasizes simplicity to meet the strict requirements of news topic classification. Through extensive testing, the algorithm demonstrated strong accuracy for both Japanese and English articles, with slightly better performance in Japanese, perhaps due to idiosyncrasies in keyword extraction for that language.

The paper outlines several experiments conducted to validate the topic discovery and classification system. It compared the performance of the proposed method with other classifiers under conditions of limited training data. Tests on English corpora from Reuters and various online news sources, as well as on a Japanese corpus, showed that the proposed algorithm outperformed traditional classifiers, especially when training data was sparse.

The authors conclude that their algorithm offers an advantage over current classifiers, providing the ability to adapt quickly in an online setting to new topics. The findings indicate that the proposed method yields reliable results for real-world news topic classification across languages.
