Related Work: The concept of deriving continuity information by passing arguments with side effects to a function traces back to the work of Longley, who utilized exceptions in this process. A comparable method is exemplified in work by Bauer and Pretnar.

Conclusion of the study: We have presented a complete, standalone proof within Martin-LÃ¶f Type Theory (MLTT) using Agda's programming language syntax. Since proofs in MLTT are equivalent to programs, we were able to execute corollaries of the proof to calculate moduli of (uniform) continuity for functions definable within the T language. Moreover, since MLTT can be interpreted within Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the Axiom of Choice (ZF(C)), where types correspond to classical mathematical sets, the findings of this study are also valid in the realm of classical mathematics.

Constructive Nature of the Proof: To demonstrate how the formal proof embodies constructive principles, we conduct several experimental exercises. These experiments are not intended to showcase the utility of the proven theorem. Instead, they simply emphasize that the theorems indeed possess tangible computational substance.
