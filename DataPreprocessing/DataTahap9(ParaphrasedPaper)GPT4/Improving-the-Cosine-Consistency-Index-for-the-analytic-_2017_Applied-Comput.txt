This academic paper focuses on the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), a widely used decision-making framework that assists in addressing multi-criteria problems. It begins with an overview of AHP's various theoretical aspects, such as the methods for establishing priorities, evaluating consistency, and improving consistency. The paper's central contribution lies in its discussion of a method designed to enhance the consistency of the judgment matrix, a crucial element in AHP, by using the Cosine Consistency Index (CCI).

The method revolves around iteratively adjusting the judgment matrix entries through cosine maximization to better the CCI. The proposed technique suggests that any judgment matrix can be modified to reach a desired CCI threshold. To validate the effectiveness of this method, the authors tested it with numerical examples and substantiated the improvements in CCI values using a paired sample t-test. The results demonstrate that the algorithm significantly enhances the CCI values, particularly when compared with existing methods like eigen vector-based methods, weighted least square methods, and logarithmic least square methods. The paper claims that the proposed approach, the Cosine Maximization Method (CMM), outperforms the others in terms of error metrics measured by Euclidean distance, which is why the study further investigates the CMM to overcome some identified limitations.
