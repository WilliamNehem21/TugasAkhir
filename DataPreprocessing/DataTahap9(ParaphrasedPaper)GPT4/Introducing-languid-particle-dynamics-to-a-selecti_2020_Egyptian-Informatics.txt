Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is an algorithm inspired by the social behavior of birds and fish, which follows multiple agents called particles through a solution space, using both their individual experiences and the group's to adjust their paths. Since its inception, PSO has undergone significant adaptations to enhance its performance and appeal, which prompts continual research.

Despite promising outcomes, there remains a need for more comprehensive testing of the PFIDI-enabled PSO algorithm against a broader range of advanced PSO variants to validate its capabilities. This paper's goal is to evaluate PFIDI's performance when incorporated with different PSO variants.

The structure of the paper is outlined as follows: an overview of related prior work, a description of the LPDI implementation in standard PSO, a presentation of five PSO variants tested with the technique, an explanation of the testing methodology and analysis of results, a separate engineering application test-case, and finally, concluding observations.

The paper delves into inertia weight adaptation, examining a technique that adjusts inertia based on fitness, which might be sensitive to the scale of fitness values. This concern is intended to optimize the speed of particles, encouraging better search efficiency.

The introduced correction of +0.05 for inertia weight, differing from the original LPSO that didn't correct inertia, was inspired by previous benchmark results suggesting enhanced performance with this adjustment.

Expanding on testing the effects of LPSO inertia switching, several PSO variants were compared, with and without LPD implementation. Among them, Dynamic Multiswarm PSO (DMS-PSO) is highlighted for its segmented approach to avoid early convergence.

The paper employs CEC 2014 tests for their impartial nature and comprehensive scope to assess LPD's influence on PSO accuracy over 100 computational runs.

LPD appears beneficial, particularly for certain multimodal and hybrid functions, supporting its default implementation in general-purpose optimization. A separate engineering application test showed mixed statistical outcomes, but overall, corroborated LPD's advantageous effects.

However, limitations exist, such as possibly promoting convergence to the detriment of thorough exploration in certain problems, and some problem classes not benefiting from LPD. Future research holds promise for more sophisticated inertia adaptations and testing on large-scale optimization issues.
