The project focuses on evaluating how springback—a phenomenon where deformed metal partially returns to its original shape post forming—affects the sheet metal forming process. Through non-linear numerical simulations using Abaqus/CAE software, the effects of varying material types and sheet metal thicknesses on springback were investigated. Boron steel (AISI 15B28H) and carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP) were tested as materials, and it was discovered that CFRP experiences less springback than steel. Additionally, it was found that increased sheet thickness leads to reduced springback. These computational findings were consistent with existing literature.

The study emphasized the significance of controlling springback, as accurate part assembly in industries like automotive and aerospace is crucial for meeting strict tolerances. The project included three simulation scenarios with different combinations of the parameters, material type and thickness. For the simulations, three rigid components (die, punch, and binder) and one deformable component (the sheet metal blank) were used, with all measurements taken from the deformable blank. The analysis reported data on stress, strain, displacement, and thickness as well as energy distribution.

Results showed that the steel had greater variation in thickness after forming compared to CFRP, implying that CFRP has a more uniform thickness distribution—a desirable trait in product quality. Further findings suggested that harder materials, higher friction coefficients, and thinner sheets all contribute to increased springback. In particular, a 1mm thick, high friction coefficient (0.25), and stiff material (AISI 15B28H steel) demonstrated pronounced springback, aligning with previous research outcomes.
