The research paper investigates the geometric and electronic properties of boron-carbon-nitrogen (BCN) nanotubes with varying compositions and atom arrangements. The cross-sectional shapes of these BCN nanotubes can appear distorted, with varying diameters represented as larger (dl) or smaller (ds) based on the maximum and minimum distances between atoms in the same cross-section. Specific models like BC6N(II) had a modest distortion (dl/ds ratio of 1.070), while others such as B4C2N2(II) showed greater distortion (dl/ds ratio of 1.212).

In their study, the researchers used density functional theory with a standard basis set (B3LYP/3-21G*) to analyze the electronic band structure of (2,2) BCN nanotubes. The "default k point" in the wave vector space, which is the center of the first Brillouin zone, was used for the computations. Among the models studied, B2C4N2(I), B4C2N2, B3C2N3(I), and B3C2N3(III) exhibited direct band gaps where the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band coincided at the same k-point. Others demonstrated indirect band gaps with these points occurring at different k-points across the Brillouin zone, with most direct band gaps found at the X-point except for B2C4N2 and C2B3N3(II).

The paper also compares the electrical properties of traditional carbon nanotubes and boron nitride nanotubes (BN-NTs), noting that carbon nanotubes behave as semiconductors while BN-NTs are insulators. The energy band gaps of the (2,2) BCN nanotubes ranged from 0.062 to 3.874 eV, indicating diverse electrical conductivities from metallic to insulating based on the specific atomic composition and structure. B4C2N2 with two adjacent boron atoms exhibited the strongest metallic behavior. Models featuring alternating straight carbon and boron-nitrogen chains (BC6N(I), B2C4N2(I), and B3C2N3(I)) were typically semiconductive, while others with larger band gaps (BC6N(II), B2C4N2(II), and B3C2N3(II)) were closer to insulators.
