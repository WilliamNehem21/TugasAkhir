Current model checking techniques are limited to verifying the security of cryptographic protocols on a small scale, considering a limited number of elements such as agents or nonces. To extend the security assurance to larger implementations, it is crucial to establish methods that allow us to extrapolate security properties from small, well-selected examples. Data independence is one approach that can help achieve this goal. This paper will discuss the approaches employed and share some of the latest findings and theoretical propositions that aim to broaden the applicability of these methods.
