Maintaining vigilance is essential for various professions, especially those that involve nighttime activities such as driving vehicles, construction work, and security patrolling. Driver drowsiness has been identified as a leading cause of accidents globally, particularly prevalent in long-haul trucking. Multiple factors contribute to fatigue-induced mishaps, including trip length, weather conditions, road monotony, the driver's experience, time of day, and the driver's health. Alerting a driver before they become drowsy is an effective method for preventing accidents related to drowsiness. Contributing factors to drowsiness include consuming large meals, medication side effects, insufficient sleep, and stress from financial or family issues. Drowsiness varies with age, gender, and lifestyle habits, such as smoking, which can negatively affect sleep and eating routines, and underlying health issues, including anxiety and hypertension. Drowsiness leads to decreased alertness, impaired performance, and reduced cognitive function, which can be tracked using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals.

The paper discusses two analytical strategies involving the processing of EEG signals for detecting drowsiness:

1. Strategy 4 involves pre-processing EEG signals, applying correntropy spectral density and the Rosenstein version of the Lyapunov exponent analysis, and calculating multi distance signal level differences. After computing the geometry of the resulting matrices, a mapping to tangent space is performed before the signals are classified using machine learning algorithms.

2. Strategy 5 also starts with pre-processing, then computes the Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) and Hilbert marginal spectrum. Features are selected using the blackhole algorithm and classified using a cascade AdaBoost classifier.

The study describes using Marginal Fisher Analysis (MFA) to graph-embed EEG data for feature selection, optimizing for both intra-class compactness and inter-class separation, and substituting the Euclidean distance with the inner product. Domain adaptation techniques learn a mapping matrix to align features from different classes for classification using four algorithms: Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and AdaBoost.

Additionally, the paper describes using an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) for learning features and optimizing system parameters, with specific attention to the training techniques for the classifiers.

The research utilizes a public EEG dataset from healthy subjects aged 17-25, obtained using a brain cap and a driving simulator, without any stimulants consumed beforehand. Outcomes were evaluated based on sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy metrics.

Results indicate that combining MFA, conditional feature mapping, and cross-domain transfer learning led to a 99.12% classification accuracy. The combination of Fast Approximate Wavelet Transform (FAWT) and Tunable Q-factor Wavelet Transform (TQWT) with ANFIS yielded 98.18% accuracy.

The highest classification accuracy of 99.13% was achieved with a strategy combining correntropy spectral density, Lyapunov exponents, tangent space mapping, and SVM. The work was supported by various Korean government and educational grants, highlighting its robust backing and potential significance in the field.
