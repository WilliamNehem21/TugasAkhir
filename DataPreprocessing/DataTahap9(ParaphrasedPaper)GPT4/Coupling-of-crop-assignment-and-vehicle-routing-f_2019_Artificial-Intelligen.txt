This paper introduces a new approach for optimizing the annual planning process in agriculture, which involves assigning crops to fields and planning the harvest sequence. Until now, research has not addressed this combined challenge. This strategic planning is crucial as it occurs at the start of the agricultural cycle and affects the entire production process.

The new method proposed offers tools to help farm managers assign crops to fields and determine the most efficient harvest sequence or "crop-tours," where fields of the same crop are serviced in an optimized order. The paper outlines eight different integer programming (IP) models tailored to various scenarios in harvest planning.

The study is structured as follows: Section 2 defines the problem and notation; Section 3 develops the algorithms; Section 4 discusses extensions to the models; Section 5 provides numerical examples; and Section 6 concludes the paper.

The core issue involves assigning crops to multiple fields linked by a network of rural roads, factoring in constraints such as slow travel speeds and geographic spread. A predetermined number of harvesters collectively service fields associated with a particular crop.

The researchers developed eight IPs to address the various requirements of effective harvest planning. Some of the IPs focus on selecting the best depot for harvester deployment when multiple options exist. The two most comprehensive IP formulations, IP-3 and IP-4, encompass all possible variations of the remaining six IPs.

The paper also acknowledges that hierarchical methods that first solve field assignments without considering field proximity, followed by computing crop-tours, might be more cost-effective in certain scenarios. Still, when maximizing clusters, this likelihood is eliminated, as the combined approach of crop assignment and vehicle routing can potentially yield the best financial outcome.

The focus of this paper has revolved around modeling the problem across common agricultural settings. Future work will concentrate on developing efficient solution methods. The authors suggest that the outcome with the current method is heuristic and potentially suboptimal due to the clustering step. Consequently, the development of IP solution methods capable of handling large-scale problems efficiently is warranted.

The paper also proposes exploring reformulations of Subtour Elimination Constraints (SECs) such as the Miller-Tucker-Zemlin (MTZ) constraints, which introduce continuous variables and give the problem a mixed-integer nature. Additionally, testing optimization algorithms like tabu search, similar to the ones Gendreau et al. (1994) used, might offer new ways to solve the suggested IPs.
