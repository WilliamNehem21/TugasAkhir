The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses related work on usability. Section 3 outlines the paper's primary goal. Section 4 details various methodologies used for website usability evaluation. Section 5 delves into analysis and experimental results. Section 6 concludes the study.

Kostaras and Xenos (2007) used heuristic evaluation to assess the usability of the Hellenic Open University website, involving usability experts in a two-phase process who later reported on detected rule violations per heuristic.

Daher and Elkabani researched web portal usability in six Lebanese universities, focusing particularly on the Beirut Arab University (BAU) portal, employing both qualitative and quantitative methods, including six sigma to analyze effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.

Participants performed five tasks across three study websites, recorded their sessions, and their performance was measured, with task completion time as an efficiency metric.

While some participants engaged in performance evaluations, others completed the WAMMI questionnaire. Through random allocation to three groups, a between-subjects design compared different participants' results.

Although automated tools help check against WCAG 2.0, manual accessibility testing with users who have disabilities is recommended for a more thorough assessment.

Task completion times were measured and analyzed, with 95% confidence intervals reported for both successful and unsuccessful tasks to obtain accurate timing data.

Independent t-tests evaluated statistical significance in task completion times across the websites, using the MstatC statistical tool.

Post-task satisfaction was measured using the After Scenario Questionnaire (ASQ), revealing significant satisfaction differences among the institutes' websites, particularly for certain tasks, and showing task time completion impact on satisfaction.

One website outscored others in attractiveness, according to WAMMI database comparisons, but scored average on other scales.
