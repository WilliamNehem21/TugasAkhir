The paper discusses the concept of model-checking in regards to a static system with a defined behavior. Typically, systems are represented by transition graphs (Kripke structures), with dynamic elements including state changes and potential branching behavior, reflected in execution paths or computation trees. The specifications set forth desired attributes of these paths or trees.

The paper recognizes that model-checking for dynamic structures is an emerging field, citing works that have encoded data structures with dynamic behaviors, such as programs or UML state machines, to make them compatible with established model-checking techniques. The paper specifically aims to introduce and validate an approach to handle dynamic networks, focusing on properties like connectivity and biconnectivity.

Previous research in dynamic networks often dealt with routing and adversarial influences, commonly assuming that network connectivity is maintained or occurs frequently. The authors introduce a game with two players, "destructor" and "constructor," who take turns, either moving or skipping, to reflect network changes. Games can be infinite or end when a player can no longer move or a victory condition is met.

In "solitaire" games, only the constructor moves, simulating the evolution of networks without any destructive interference. The constructor may create or re-label nodes, and in a variant, also remove them, demonstrating control by a single entity.

The paper addresses potential criticism of the imbalance between the constructor and destructor by suggesting that the destructor may remain inactive for certain periods before acting. This balance is context-dependent, with fault tolerance applications naturally favoring the constructor's actions.

One focus of the paper is demonstrating that for each Turing machine, there exists a corresponding solitaire game such that the machine halts on an empty tape if and only if the constructor can form a biconnected network under specific rules. The paper asserts that one only needs to examine a finite number of unique networks from an initial network to determine the winner and establish a winning strategy by constructing a game tree up to a certain depth.

The model is kept simple, omitting edge deletions and insertions, which do not affect the decidability of the model-checking problem due to the bounded number of possible edges. Additionally, the paper addresses the computational complexity of the problem, presenting a PSPACE-hardness result without node creation based on sabotage games and also offering a NP-hardness proof that relates to the vertex cover problem.
