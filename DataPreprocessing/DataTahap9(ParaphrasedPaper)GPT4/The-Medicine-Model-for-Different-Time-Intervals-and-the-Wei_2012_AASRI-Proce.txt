The paper discusses a medication administration strategy that accounts for variations in patient weight, different times of day, and different rates of drug metabolism and absorption. The authors highlight the challenges of administering the same medication at consistent intervals and the need to adjust dosages according to these factors. They propose a model where drug concentration changes are directly proportional to dosage.

Two mathematical models are created to estimate appropriate drug concentrations for daytime and nighttime. Analysis of these models suggests that a larger dose is required in the morning, with equal but smaller doses at noon and evening. The relationship between the patient's weight and the medication dose is also established.

The paper is structured to first present the proportional relationship between drug concentration rates and dosages, followed by assumptions and the development of mathematical models. Upon solving and verifying these models, the authors find that variations in dosages should be based on the time of day and the patient's weight.

Specifically, the regimen involves administering medication three times daily to fish, with initial dosages adjusted based on increments or decrements of 10kg from a baseline weight. This approach could potentially be applied to various aquatic and terrestrial animals, provided that the initial dosages are appropriately designed and adjusted.

Overall, the paper suggests a scientific method of medication for pharmaceutical manufacturers to produce pills of different doses that are convenient for patient intake. Additionally, it offers physicians a framework for prescribing medication dosages tailored to individuals, with the goal of achieving the most efficient recovery without causing harm to the patient.

Please note that the paper seems to contain some inconsistencies, such as initially referring to patients and then specifically to diseased fishes and other animals. This might be due to errors in the provided summary or translation inaccuracies from the original text. Therefore, for a more accurate representation, one would need to access the full academic paper.
