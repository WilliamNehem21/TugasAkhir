This academic paper discusses the challenges of spam detection and the limitations of classical automata in managing spam filters based on regular expressions. The authors point out that while machine learning is a common solution for spam detection, many organizations still rely on regex-based filters, which can result in a cumbersome and inefficient accumulation of redundant rules. The paper proposes Symmetric Alternating Finite Automata (s-AFAs) as a more efficient alternative, capable of executing Boolean operations more simply compared to standard finite automata (s-FAs). A key advantage of s-AFAs is their linear complexity for alternation, in contrast to the quadratic and exponential complexities of s-FAs for equivalent operations.

The paper further explores the construction of s-AFAs for union and intersection operations, highlighting that these automata are essentially a combination of their component states, final states, and transitions, differing only by an initial state which represents either a disjunction or a conjunction of the initial states of the components.

Considering the normalization of s-AFAs, the authors acknowledge that it can lead to an exponential increase in the number of transitions, although this exponential factor is not dependent on the state count. Additionally, the paper touches on computational methods for Boolean combinations of predicates and presents a candidate algorithm for the congruence problem, which is shown to be NP-complete.

The authors evaluated the performance of different worklist implementations within their tool and conclude that a priority queue is consistently more efficient than either FIFO or LIFO approaches.

The paper discusses benchmarking based on three sets of Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formulae and compares the performance of their BDD-based alternating automata variant with MONA, a well-known tool for automata. The discussion makes it clear that comparisons with other tools were either not relevant or not favorable.

Lastly, the paper dives into the concept of alternating automata, acknowledging their theoretical complexity but also their potential benefits for program verification, exemplified by practical implementations like ALASKA. The discussion includes how ALASKA utilizes bit-vectors to represent the alphabet and state sets, mentioning the use of BDDs for modeling the search space and state-space reduction techniques such as antichains and bisimulation up to congruence.

In summary, the paper highlights the potential of s-AFAs to improve spam detection tasks by replacing traditional automata and regex-based filters with a more efficient model, while also demonstrating computational approaches and benchmarking strategies for the evaluation of these techniques in practical applications.
