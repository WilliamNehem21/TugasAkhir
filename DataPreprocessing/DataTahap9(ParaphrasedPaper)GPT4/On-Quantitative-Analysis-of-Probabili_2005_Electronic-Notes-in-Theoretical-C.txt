Our research promotes the use of approximate noninterference when analyzing the security of probabilistic protocols. We employ a probabilistic process algebra for formal protocol representation and measure process similarity through weak probabilistic bisimulation. This method is demonstrated by evaluating a probabilistic nonrepudiation protocol, allowing us to measure its fairness.

To incorporate probabilities, we add probabilistic elements to algebraic operations. Our model combines generative and reactive methods, with internal and output actions determined by probability distributions (generative) and input actions responding to environmental cues (reactive). This enables a blend of system-decided probabilistic behaviors and environment-induced nondeterministic interactions.

We reference processes created by our syntax as a set denoted by G, which includes finite state, guarded, and closed terms. We simplify semantic presentation with notations for input actions (RACT) and output/internal actions (GACT). Our security analysis framework focuses on the 'low' level, which cannot directly detect 'high' level events but can observe the probability distribution of low-level activities. In this context, 'high' can potentially manipulate 'low' by interacting with the system's high-level interface.

Security is implemented by timestamping messages to confirm their freshness and prevent replication attacks. Nonrepudiation is assured by specific signed messages for both origin and receipt. The protocol maintains fairness if it completes correctly or if it terminates before any valuable information is exchanged. However, fairness could be compromised if the recipient delays acknowledgment to manipulate message decryption. The success of the protocol hinges on the timely reciprocation of acknowledgments, and strategies are in place to prevent unfair actions by setting deadlines for acknowledgments. The protocol is susceptible to attacks where the malicious recipient tries to guess and block the final acknowledgment.

Our analysis in section 3.1 confirms that the protocol achieves nonrepudiation of origin with certainty and nonrepudiation of the recipient with a probability below one. The emphasis is on estimating the likelihood of the recipient violating nonrepudiation, and our research models the originatorâ€™s behavior to assess the recipient as a potential adversary.
