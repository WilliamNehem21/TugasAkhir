The paper discusses the challenges that researchers face in identifying relevant scientific publications and potential collaborators online due to the overwhelming amount of information available. To address this issue, the authors propose an innovative architecture that integrates multiple bibliographic sources to help identify common research areas and potential collaboration networks among Ecuadorian researchers. The proposed system leverages ontologies, vocabularies, and linked data technologies to enrich a central database with semantic information, making it easier to find related knowledge areas and foster collaboration. The prototype offers a centralized repository for bibliographic data and uses data mining techniques to discover similarities in research topics.

The increasing volume of academic literature online, spread across various digital platforms and databases, contributes to the difficulties in literature review and project collaboration efforts across institutions. The solution aims to facilitate the creation of research networks and enhance information accessibility while promoting collaboration among academic institutions. The paper acknowledges existing tools available for academic exploration but highlights the limitations of each and the need for a unified approach to data retrieval and enrichment for improved alignment and clarity.

The paper is structured with a review of related work, an outline of the proposed architecture for locating research networks within the Ecuadorian academic community, and a presentation of the conclusions and future directions of the project. Emphasizing the need for disambiguation and data consistency, the authors describe methodologies used to clean and store data accurately, preventing duplication and incorrect authorship assignments. They integrate data from multiple bibliographical sources, harmonize it into a common model using the BIBO ontology and employ components such as data extraction, disambiguation, storage, and enrichment to build a comprehensive, semantically enriched repository. To facilitate knowledge discovery and clustering for meaningful research connections, the authors apply data mining techniques and propose the use of semantic technologies to label and group related publications within the repository.
