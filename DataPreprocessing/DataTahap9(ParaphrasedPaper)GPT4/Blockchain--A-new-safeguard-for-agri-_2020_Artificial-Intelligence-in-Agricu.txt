The implementation of blockchain technology in agriculture has recently commenced and offers the potential to greatly enhance traceability and transparency in the agri-food industry, improving food safety, quality, and sustainability. Despite its infancy, this technology shows promise in revolutionizing food tracking processes, ensuring data integrity, and reducing transaction costs. This review aims to spark discussion and encourage the adoption of blockchain across the agri-food sector by examining its principles, application models, and specific use cases, such as Walmart's pork traceability system. Additionally, it addresses challenges such as data and cost management, security, and integration, which must be overcome to realize the full potential of blockchain in agriculture.

Originally introduced in 2008 as the technology underpinning Bitcoin, blockchain offers a decentralized ledger that enables secure, peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries like banks. Transactions are verified by network nodes using cryptographic methods and recorded in blocks. Each block contains a unique hash and references the previous block's hash, forming a chain that makes retroactive alterations detectable and nearly impossible.

Blockchain can benefit the agri-food industry by ensuring traceability and safety, from recording production details and monitoring environmental factors to enabling rapid financial transactions. However, its deployment faces various obstacles – from ensuring data accuracy and compatibility between different blockchain systems to addressing privacy concerns and regulatory requirements – that need to be addressed to enhance its effectiveness and consumer trust in food products.

Ultimately, although blockchain heralds an exciting future for safer and more reliable agri-food systems, it requires careful integration with existing food supply infrastructures, harmonization across different applications, and a keen understanding of product-specific tracking needs. With these considerations, blockchain stands to transform the agricultural sector.
