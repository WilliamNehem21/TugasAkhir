I present a heuristic approach based on Tabu search to generate feasible solutions for the recently defined Prize-Collecting Rural Postman Problem (PRPP), a comprehensive extension of other arc routing problems. The effectiveness of this algorithm is demonstrated through computational experiments across various instance types, displaying its superiority over prior methods.

In the context of providing service to an edge, it's important to consider both the incurred cost of travel and the profit gained from the service. For the first service on an edge within a route, revenue is secured. The goal of the PRPP is to devise a route, starting and ending at a depot, that optimizes net profit by serving edges and minimizing traversal costs.

The PRPP has real-world applications, especially in scenarios where arc routing problems seek to minimize costs, for services that are fixed geographically, the focus is on mitigating the cost of service routes rather than selecting the edges to serve. It effectively models more intricate practical problems, such as how a profit-oriented company could optimize service provision like recycling collection or postal delivery, choosing to service only profitable areas.

Leveraging the established success of Tabu search in addressing various arc routing problems, I've crafted a PRPP-solving algorithm grounded in this metaheuristic. The algorithm encompasses two stages: initial feasible solutions construction using two methods, "Union of Connected Components" and "Successive Elimination of Connected Components," followed by Tabu search application to enhance these starting points.

The algorithm adaptation ensures that iterations in Tabu search are productive, with provisions to use the "Union of Connected Components" solution for diversification if needed. The algorithm attentively incorporates properties particular to the PRPP during iterations, incentivizing the inclusion of likely profitable edges and averting less desirable ones according to specific criteria, thereby optimizing the search process.

The algorithm exhibits a divergent strategy upon successive non-improvements by initiating a Tabu search with a random feasible solution, and intensification in subsequent occurrences by choosing the best-found solution.

When pitted against another heuristic, the presented Tabu search-based approach only underperforms in two specific problem instances. However, it secures optimal solutions in the majority of the tested problem types, proving its efficiency. Despite longer computation times in smaller instances due to the dual-initial-solution approach, the overall computational effort of the Tabu search is considered reasonable, especially given its effectiveness across various problem sizes.
