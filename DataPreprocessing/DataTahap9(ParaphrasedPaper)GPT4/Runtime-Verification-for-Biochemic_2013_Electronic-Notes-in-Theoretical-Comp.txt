The academic paper discusses the suitability of the biochemical paradigm for developing models of autonomous systems and the creation of new programming languages. It states that in order to ensure that these programs perform as intended, it is necessary to define their semantics clearly and develop verification techniques. The focus of the paper is a higher-order biochemical calculus that includes abstractions for modeling system states and dynamics through rules and strategies. An extension of this calculus offers a runtime verification method to automatically detect failures in satisfying defined properties, particularly a subset of linear temporal logic (LTL) safety and liveness properties.

The paper presents the concept of port graphs, which are visual structures used to model systems with dynamic topologies, where components interact concurrently and in a distributed manner. Components are represented as nodes with ports, and their interactions are depicted as edges. Port graph rewrite rules simulate system evolution by manipulating these nodes and connections based on specified conditions. By incorporating port graphs into the biochemical calculus, the authors created a port graph calculus demonstrated to model autonomous systems and biochemical networks efficiently. The Porgy environment serves as an implementation platform for the port graph calculus.

The authors aim to enhance trust in biochemical autonomous system models by ensuring runtime consistency with expected properties and detecting safety violations. Runtime verification is viewed as an effective method to build confidence in systems' correctness concerning their formal specifications. The authors have already suggested a technique for verifying invariant properties of biochemical programs by encoding them into the programs' modeling rules, which are dynamically checked during execution.

The paper is organized into five sections. The first section overviews the abstract biochemical calculus, including its syntax and semantics. The second section discusses the Kripke structure associated with biochemical programs and the types of temporal formulae being considered. In the third section, runtime verification is formalized within this context, with modifications to the calculus allowing simultaneous computation and verification. The final section outlines future perspectives.

An example biochemical program is described, including libraries with loaning services and various departments with statistics textbooks and students. The program includes strategies for operation.

In a subsection, the paper touches on defining strategies for encoding LTL formulae featuring two temporal operators, suggesting a method or automatic procedure could be developed for this purpose. A further challenge mentioned is encoding more complex LTL formulae.

Future work involves implementing the runtime verification technique discussed in the Porgy system, which is under development and features graph visualization and strategy languages. The authors envision applying this to model wireless sensor networks and biochemical signaling pathways by analyzing random executions and critical properties.
