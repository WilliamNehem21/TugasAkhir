Bio-PEPA is a language recently developed for modeling biochemical networks that utilizes a discrete concentration level approach rather than tracking individual molecules. This approach allows for varying granularity by adjusting the concentration step size, which translates into a different number of discrete levels and thus enables a wide spectrum of analysis methods, such as numerical analysis that leans on Continuous-Time Markov Chains (CTMC) with states corresponding to different concentration levels.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides an introduction to Bio-PEPA, elucidating how discrete levels and transition rates are defined. Section 3 defines the CTMC with levels. Section 4 details the conversion from Bio-PEPA models to Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) and CTMCs, and Section 5 explores the relationship between these distinct forms of models. In Section 6, the authors use the repressilator model—a genetic network exhibiting oscillatory behavior—as a case study for their approach. Section 7 concludes the paper, sharing insights and potential directions for future research.

The framework applies to biochemical networks consisting of various interacting species and reactions occurring within different compartments. Reaction dynamics are captured by specific kinetic laws. The paper makes certain assumptions, including that species have a maximum concentration to maintain a finite CTMC, although unbounded growth can be accepted under practical constraints due to relationships between molecules and reactions.

Section 5 confirms the concurrence between ODE models and CTMC with levels in the Bio-PEPA framework in the limit. However, for a finite step size, the extent of agreement varies. Empirical evidence suggests that even with few levels (e.g., when h=1 or h=7), some pathways show negligible differences between the models; this concurrence is not universally applicable. Relationships between CTMC step size and ODE agreements are further explored, and while existing literature offers some convergence probability estimates, those estimates are complex and not very instructive for determining the ideal step size. The paper proposes a distance measure to quantify the divergence between the ODE trajectories and the numerical solution of the CTMC across all species over time.

Both definitions of distance suggest that the divergence declines with the step size, but extremely small step sizes yield a huge number of states, making even CTMC simulation very resource-intensive. Hence, modellers face a balance between model accuracy—which depends on both the number of simulation runs and step size—and practical feasibility.

Finally, the paper lists specific reactions involved in the study, including transcription and translation processes plus the degradation of MRNAs and proteins, exemplified by reactions tr1, tr2, tr3 for transcription with inhibition, trl1, trl2, trl3 for translation, and di for degradation where i ranges from 1 to 6.
