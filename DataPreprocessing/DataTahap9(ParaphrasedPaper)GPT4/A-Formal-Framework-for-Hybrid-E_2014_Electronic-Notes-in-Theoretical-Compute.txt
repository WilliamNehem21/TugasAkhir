In this paper, the authors introduce Hybrid Event-B, a formal modeling language for hybrid systems that extends Event-B and incorporates differential dynamic logic. Hybrid systems are those comprising both discrete and continuous elements, often found in embedded and cyberphysical systems. By leveraging differential dynamic logic's abilities, Hybrid Event-B can model and reason about systems with mixed dynamics effectively.

The paper's key contribution is the introduction of a 'differential event' in Hybrid Event-B which enables the integration of differential dynamic logic for simulating continuous and discrete dynamics in one framework. This feature provides the means to develop formal specifications and incremental refinements suited for hybrid systems.

The authors outline the syntax, semantics, and refinement process for Hybrid Event-B, demonstrating how it can capture system behavior and correctness assertions. Through an example involving a train control system, the utility of Hybrid Event-B in specifying hybrid systems is emphasized.

Also discussed are proof obligations related to the refinement of differential events, which advocate for meticulous development of hybrid systems. The paper touches on the underlying principles that inspired the Hybrid Event-B project, noting its roots in Event-B's approach but augmented with the mathematical power of differential dynamic logic.

The paper is laid out as follows: background information on Event-B and differential dynamic logic is first provided, followed by a detailed explanation of Hybrid Event-B's formal aspects and refinement approach. An illustrative example is given, then the paper explores related work. Finally, the authors conclude and suggest directions for future research.

Event-B itself is a specification language grounded in set theory and first-order predicate logic, commonly used to model reactive and distributed systems. The Event-B framework facilitates the composition and validation of specifications through a process of refinement. The main elements defining the dynamic behavior of systems in Event-B are machines, which consist of variables, invariants, variants, and events.

In Hybrid Event-B, a model comprises machines that encode the system's dynamic behavior through its variables, invariants, variants, and events, and contexts which capture the static parts of the model including carrier sets, constants, axioms, and theorems.
