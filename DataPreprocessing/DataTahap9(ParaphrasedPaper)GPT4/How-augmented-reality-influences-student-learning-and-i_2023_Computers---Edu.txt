The study explores the impact of augmented reality (AR) visualizations on student learning and inquiry, focusing on one-on-one tutoring in physics education. Researchers designed an interactive AR tool to aid in teaching electromagnetism concepts and investigated how varying levels of AR complexity influence student learning. The study found that more complex AR representations (dynamic 3D visuals interacting with real objects) fostered deeper student engagement, a wider array of inquiry styles, and a greater willingness to actively participate in learning.

Through qualitative analysis of student-instructor interactions, a coding scheme was employed to evaluate student inquiries in relation to AR content, revealing that AR visualizations prompted students to contemplate multiple scientific concepts, understand interconnections between them, and engage more actively. The presence of AR also seemed to reduce the need for integration questions, suggesting that AR might fill knowledge gaps and aid in concept comprehension.

However, the study acknowledges limitations such as the potential influence of the activity design on the types of inquiries performed by students. It suggests the need for future research to include additional measures of student internal processes, like cognitive load. While the full complexity AR group showed external signs of active learning, the study does not dismiss the engagement of students with lower-complexity AR content. It encourages others to apply their coding scheme to similar settings to extend the findings across different studies.
