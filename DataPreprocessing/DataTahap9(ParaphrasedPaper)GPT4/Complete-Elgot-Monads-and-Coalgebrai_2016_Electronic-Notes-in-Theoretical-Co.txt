The concept of complete Elgot algebras presented in our work expands upon the earlier idea by adapting it for parametrized monads, and it further develops the concept of iterative algebras by introducing an iteration operation governed by specific principles, instead of insisting on unique solutions. Theorem 5.7 in our paper broadens the scope of the result found in [5, Theorem 5.8].
