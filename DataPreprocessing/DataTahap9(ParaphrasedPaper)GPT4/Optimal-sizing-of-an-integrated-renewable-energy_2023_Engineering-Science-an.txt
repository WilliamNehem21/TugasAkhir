The paper discusses the global energy access issue, noting that many people worldwide still lack basic energy services. To address this, distributed renewable energy systems have become a popular solution for providing electricity, especially in rural remote areas where grid electrification is not feasible. These renewable energy-based microgrid systems are becoming more effective and are designed to meet the needs of specific areas.

Excess energy generated during periods of low demand is stored in Energy Storage Systems (ESS). When the ESS is fully charged, surplus energy is often wasted. However, this energy could be diverted to applications like cooking, water heating, or charging electric vehicles (EVs), which have become increasingly important energy consumers within microgrid systems. EVs offer a promising means to utilize surplus energy and improve the overall energy efficiency and cost-effectiveness of these systems.

The paper examines various studies on the optimal sizing of Integrated Renewable Energy Systems (IRES) from different perspectives. Various system configurations have been studied, with an emphasis on how much surplus energy is used or wasted. Recent literature has shown interest in integrating EVs into power systems, with several studies analyzing the effects of EVs on system performance and on cost-saving potentials associated with surplus energy utilization.

However, there appears to be a gap in research on the charging of EVs in standalone IRES that are entirely powered by renewable energy. The paper considers the annual maintenance cost (AMC) for various IRES components.

The paper presents a performance analysis recommending the "Immediate Charging" (IC) strategy for EV charging in microgrid systems, as it leads to charging more EVs at a lower cost of energy (COE). The study has developed an optimized IRES framework using the novel Chimp Optimization Algorithm (CHOA), where EVs serve as a dump load to consume surplus energy. The optimal IRES and EV charging strategies were evaluated for their potential to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, with the findings supporting the IC strategy for efficient microgrid operation.
