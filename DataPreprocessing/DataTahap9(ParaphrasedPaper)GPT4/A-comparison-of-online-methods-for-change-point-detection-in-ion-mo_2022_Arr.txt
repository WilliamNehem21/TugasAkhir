Change points are identified as sudden shifts in time series data and their detection is helpful for time series modeling and forecasting. These algorithms aim to pinpoint the exact moment when an ongoing process undergoes a variation, marking a shift in the data generation mechanism. Change point detection finds applications in various fields including quality control, navigation systems, seismology, healthcare, and more.

Aminikhanghahi and Cook have reviewed a range of change point detection algorithms, discussing their use cases, whether they are supervised or unsupervised, and how to measure their performance. The full details of this research can be found in their publication.

Electronic noses (eNoses) consist of a collection of gas sensors that detect changes in the surrounding air, such as odors and other gaseous substances. The sensors, which can include metal oxides and various polymers, respond to changes in gas composition in a distinctive way, depending on the technology and sensor types utilized.

The study introduces a multivariate version of the CUSUM algorithm, termed matrix form CUSUM. This method replicates the traditional CUSUM calculations within a matrix framework, leading to substantial time savings without sacrificing accuracy. It can be applied to provide a unified change point that averages detected changes across all channels or deliver distinct change points for individual channels. Averaging may reduce precision but enhances robustness, particularly when some channels do not respond to changes.

In the experiment, scent sources were tested using a ChemPro100i both in open and closed environments, sampled at 1Hz. Each source was measured over five 5-minute intervals, with 3-minute breaks to clear the measuring device, creating a total of 30 datasets. Change points were designated manually by examining time series graphs.

The chosen algorithms occasionally identified arbitrary change points, impacting the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) scores even when actual change points were absent. To address this, the algorithms were refined to exclude any channel from analysis if its variability was below a 0.05 Pa threshold â€“ a value determined through comprehensive dataset analysis available in supplementary materials.

The study found that Shewhart control charts, the CUSUM algorithm, and the Bayesian Online Change Point Detection (BOCPD) algorithm were effective when computed on individual channels, particularly with clearly visible change points. The multivariate Max-CUSUM and Matrix Form CUSUM, which assess all channels at once, proved to be the fastest and most dependable algorithms in this research.
