This academic paper discusses a method for analyzing the safety of complex industrial systems, emphasizing the importance of a system's ability to detect faults and enter a safe state over its reliability or time between failures. The paper outlines a hierarchical approach to system design and failure analysis, advocating for the simplification of safety checks by modeling individual modules and subsystems with finite failure modes. Rather than assessing each component's failure in every possible scenario, failures are classified as specific modes for each module, and their impact is then evaluated in the context of the larger system.

For instance, a failed capacitor leading to excessive noise in the power supply does not need to be scrutinized for every other component, but rather as a well-defined failure mode of the power supply module itself. The effects of this failure mode are then considered only where relevant, and many modules (like a heating element) may not be affected by it.

The paper also explores enhancing predefined Euler diagrams, commonly used for modeling systems, with an additional conversion step. It involves transforming a spider diagram into a new diagram where each spider represents a set that can be integrated into higher-level diagrams. This will assist in creating practical models, particularly with a default spider that represents a power supply, which typically fails completely or operates incorrectly under certain failure conditions.

The example of a microprocessor system is used to illustrate the concept. The microprocessor depends on a stable DC power supply and can be damaged by mains voltage, but it is indifferent to the AC voltage used for a heater element. The system then encompasses a relay and a heating element, each with their respective failure modesâ€”such as the relay welding itself on or failing to activate, or the heating element breaking and ceasing to function. The function of the relay is contingent upon both the microprocessor and the power supply's AC output.

Finally, the paper discusses extending the technique to handle scenarios with multiple simultaneous failures within components. This approach acknowledges that analyzing double failures can uncover additional failure modes, as the combination of two faults often results in a greater variety of system behaviors than individual failures alone.
