The paper discusses the trend of desktop applications transitioning to online platforms, leading to rich internet applications (RIAs), which are convenient for users and easier to maintain for developers. These include web-based mail clients, office suites, and photo-editing tools.

At ITiCSE 2006, a working group examined the integration of algorithm visualizations with hypertext, emphasizing the role of visualization-enhanced hypertextbooks in enhancing the teaching of algorithms. Key features for these hypertextbooks include integrated visualizations, student engagement, enriched learning environments, content management system features, and attractive design.

The paper introduces XAAL (Extensible Algorithm Animation Language), which describes animations at varying levels of abstraction, such as graphical elements or data structures and their operations. XAAL aims to simplify the transformation process of algorithm animations (AAs) across different formats and systems, addressing the challenge of import and export capabilities in visualization systems.

The focus then shifts to the recent advances in RIA technologies, particularly JavaScript, and the emergence of numerous libraries that assist web development, including Dojo, MooTools, Prototype, Script.aculo.us, jQuery, and Google Web Toolkit. However, challenges exist, such as platform-specific issues with browsers like Internet Explorer, potential conflicts when using multiple JavaScript libraries, and the fact that JavaScript's client-side code accessibility compromises the reliability of student evaluations.

While JavaScript is central to the discussion, the paper acknowledges other promising technologies that it does not cover in detail. The authors justify using JavaScript for its independence from proprietary software, broad platform compatibility without the need for plugins, versatility with server-side components, and the robustness of the technology supported by a growing number of libraries.
