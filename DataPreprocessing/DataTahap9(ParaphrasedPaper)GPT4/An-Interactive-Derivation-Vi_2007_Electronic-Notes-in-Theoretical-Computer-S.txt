This work introduces the Interactive Derivation Viewer (IDV), a tool that graphically represents logical derivations coded in the TPTP (Thousands of Problems for Theorem Provers) language. IDV, accessible through the SystemOnTPTP interface online, allows for quick and interactive exploration of derivations' features via a web browser.

Being sensitive to formula types (FOF or CNF), IDV executes in two main phases for rendering: firstly, laying out the directed acyclic graph (DAG) nodes and connections, secondly, creating the graphical display. It employs a spring embedding graph drawing method to optimally space out nodes and avoid overlaps. While the nodes' positions are fixed post-configuration, the tool proceeds to generate Bezier curves for edge representations.

A key feature of IDV is its ability to summarize derivations by rating the 'interestingness' of inferred CNF formulas, utilizing a threshold set by the user, to display only the most relevant lemmas and hide the rest. This rating is assessed by the AGInt system, with ratings stored within the formula records. Users can trigger a redraw to update the DAG display, emphasizing significant nodes.

The 'interestingness' factor is further divided into three metrics:

1. Surprisingness: A measure of novel associations between symbols, with rarer combinations scoring higher in interest.
   
2. Intensity: Quantifies how well a formula encapsulates information from its leaf ancestors, with higher scores indicating more summarization.

3. Adaptivity: Assesses the constraints on universally quantified variables, with tighter constraints being more interesting.

Following these individual ratings, the 'usefulness' score is calculated, reflecting a formula’s importance as a lemma based on its contribution to proving further interesting formulas. Formulas meeting a runtime criterion are deemed interesting, and final ratings are normalized and averaged.

This paper also highlights IDV's effective use of visual cues to offer insights into the structure of derivations, and its superior capability in extracting proof summaries compared to other tools. In summary, IDV enhances the user’s ability to distill and focus on the pivotal aspects of theorem proving derivations.
