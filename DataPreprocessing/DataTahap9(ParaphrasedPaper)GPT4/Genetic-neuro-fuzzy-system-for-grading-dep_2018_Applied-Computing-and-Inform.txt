The effectiveness of the NN-FL (neural network-fuzzy logic) system hinges greatly on several rules and assigned weights such as v1 through v7 and w1. The system's structure becomes variable only if the FLC's (fuzzy logic controller's) rule base is optimized, meaning some rules are excluded. A considerable amount of research has been published on creating an optimal NN-FL system. The present study utilizes two distinct methodologies, which are summarized as follows.

In the first method, the rule base (RB) remains unchanged throughout its training phase. Instead, only the weights v1 to v7 and w1 are adjusted using the backpropagation (BP) algorithm. This adjustment typically revolves around the minimization of the mean squared error (E) in prediction.

The primary drawback of Approach 1 is the potential to get caught in local minima, and it only focuses on optimizing the weights. Therefore, Approach 2 seeks to optimize both the database (DB) and the RB by employing a genetic algorithm (GA). A GA with a 4454-bit chromosome is used, with the first 80 bits representing the database (allocating 10 bits per variable). The remaining 4374 bits depict the rule base, using two bits to signify each rule (00 for medium, 01 and 10 for moderate, and 11 for severe) strength category. A typical string in this representation format is presented.

If 'nij' represents the frequency of activation for the 'jth' linguistic term (where j equals 1 for 'mild,' 2 for 'moderate,' and 3 for 'severe') given the 'ith' input condition (which corresponds to different input values) during training, then 'n' would be the total count of triggered rules. Consequently, the probability of occurrence for the 'jth' linguistic term given the 'ith' input condition can be calculated and used to identify redundant rules that could potentially be removed from the rule base. Detecting which rules are superfluous can be challenging, but this paper aims to accomplish rule identification by employing the concept of an importance factor. Rules that exhibit a relatively lower importance factor are deemed unnecessary and could be eliminated, ensuring that the act of removal does not result in a scenario where no rules are fired.
