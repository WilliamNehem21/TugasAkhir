Automatic code modification is frequently used in Java to enhance existing software without changing the original code base. Techniques like aspect-oriented programming and bytecode rewriting allow implementation of concerns such as logging and error handling easily. However, more involved alterations that add significant new functionality to an application while maintaining its original execution semantics are complex.

The discussed proxy-based object model serves to abstract object implementations and obfuscate whether objects are local or remote to a particular virtual machine. This enables the distribution and migration of objects across the RuggedJ network while keeping the execution semantics and class structure of the original application intact. The use of interfaces in rewritten bytecode allows elimination of proxies in cases where object locality is predetermined.

RuggedJ's implementation is advanced and has been tested on realistic applications in a single-node environment. Work is in progress to extend this to more complex multi-node systems. Classes are split into instance and static parts to ensure static data is unique within the network, and custom class loaders present only the modified class versions to the Java VM to avoid conflicts.

Various classes and interfaces are generated to handle localization and remote interaction. For example, "Class X Stub" represents a remote object, and object allocations are managed as pairs consisting of a local/stub and a proxy object. This setup allows for efficient object migration across nodes.

The design permits direct allocation of local or stub objects without proxies for non-migrating objects, reducing unnecessary overhead. Consistency is maintained by making method calls and field accesses through the defined interfaces, minimizing the need for transforming calling code while allowing for object type flexibility.

For unmodifiable classes, wrappers are generated since they cannot be distributed or transformed. Static data representation as objects ensures a single network-wide copy of the data, avoiding inconsistencies.

During the rewriting process, certain bytecode operations like private method calls or constructor invocations require special handling. Furthermore, field accesses and static method bodies are transformed to work within the object-oriented framework.

Application distribution is managed through object allocation strategies decided at runtime or by partitioning strategies set by the application author.

The system replaces arrays with wrappers to maintain type information for bytecode operations. While the transformation process is mostly automated and efficient, it may not guarantee correctness in all circumstances, particularly in edge cases constructed by an adversarial programmer. However, such issues are expected to be rare under normal programming practices.
