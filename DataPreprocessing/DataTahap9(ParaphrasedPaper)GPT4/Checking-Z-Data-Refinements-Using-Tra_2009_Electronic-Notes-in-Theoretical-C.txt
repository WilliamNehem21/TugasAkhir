The paper discusses the process of data refinement in software development, which involves deriving more precise specifications from general ones using a mathematical relationship. This refinement has specific rules requiring verification by interactive theorem proving systems. The authors suggest an automated refinement checking method to check Z data refinement rules using cSPM (machine-readable version of CSP process algebra) to interpret the relational semantics of the rules and traceability features of CSP to ensure correct refinement.

The approach involves translating Z specifications into cSPM with some constraints due to differences in language constructs. The main contribution is reducing manual effort in data refinement by allowing automatic verification and calculation of the relation between abstract and concrete specifications.

The paper sets out how each refinement rule corresponds to relational semantics. It highlights that different features of the modeling are considered during the verification process. The approach presented doesn't directly verify the data refinement; instead, it uses model checking to validate the proof obligation rules.

The method automatically computes the retrieval relation, covering all possible state combinations and ensuring a retrieval is found when refinement exists. Then, it checks for the non-emptiness of valid retrieve sets to confirm refinement. This methodology also helps identify specific rules that might invalidate a refinement.

The paper compares this approach with another one that converts Z to Alloy for verification and discusses the advantages and limitations of both methods, particularly regarding infinite domains. It also outlines the future steps to integrate data abstraction to limit data domains before applying the method and to automate the translation of Z to cSPM within the existing tool.

In summary, the paper proposes an automated mechanism for validating Z data refinements through cSPM, reducing the dependency on manual intervention and leveraging model checking to ensure correctness and aid in the refinement process.
