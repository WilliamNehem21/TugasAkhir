Vital signs such as heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV), respiration rate (RR), and oxygen saturation (SpO2) are critical indicators of an individual's physical and mental health. The heart is at the center of the cardiovascular system, pumping oxygenated, nutrient-rich blood throughout the body, with HR being a key measure of cardiac function. Monitoring HR is essential for health assessments, as heart diseases are among the leading causes of death globally. For instance, in 2020, heart disease was responsible for approximately 697,000 deaths in the US alone.

HR is traditionally measured as beats per minute, but a healthy heart exhibits natural variability in rhythm. HRV, which measures variations between individual heartbeats, is controlled by the autonomic nervous system (ANS). It's a critical metric for evaluating ANS function, particularly in patients with diabetes or who have suffered a heart attack.

This academic paper is structured as follows: Section 2 reviews contact-free vital sign monitoring technologies. Section 3 proposes a network called MIBINet, detailing pre- and post-processing techniques. Section 4 presents the results of numerical experiments. The final section, Section 5, discusses the findings, strengths, and limitations of MIBINet.

The proposed approach is more adaptable and versatile than previous methods, particularly due to an innovative technique for synthetic IBI (inter-beat interval) generation that handles irregular heart rates effectively. Discrepancies between training and test sets in the dataset led to the development of a novel data augmentation method for training deep learning models. Due to constraints of neural networks regarding input dimensions, the dimensionality of radar data inputs is standardized using a rolling window and zero-padding technique.

MIBINet is designed as a computationally efficient CNN architecture for real-time IBI estimation, simplifying and boosting heart rate monitoring efficiency. The network's performance is evaluated using the Pearson correlation coefficient and root mean square error (RMSE), comparing it to state-of-the-art models.

Tests over various datasets showed that MIBINet consistently outperformed a method known as HSMM. The paper also introduced a weighted regression loss function that improved the accuracy of IBI estimation and a novel IBI augmentation technique to balance imbalanced datasets.
