In this study, we explore how hierarchical reasoning can be applied to verify the properties of intricate systems. We use sequential local theory extensions to model a significantly simplified example taken from the European Train Control System (ETCS) standard. We demonstrate that testing invariants and conducting bounded model checking for safety properties, which are represented by universally quantified formulas dependent on various system parameters, can be efficiently transformed into satisfiability checks for non-quantified formulas within a foundational theory.

We conduct a simplified case study based on the ETCS standard, specifically examining a communication device that oversees a particular railway segment and manages train movement according to their current positions. These positions are reported to a control center at specific intervals, which then dictates train speeds or permits their free movement within a designated speed range. Previous efforts have addressed similar verification challenges.

The paper's structure is as follows: Section 2 presents essential theoretical results. In Section 3, we detail the case study. Section 4 describes our method for invariant testing and bounded model checking through hierarchical reasoning. The paper concludes with Section 5, offering conclusions and future research directions.

Our case study is based on a specification from the ETCS standard concerning a Radio Block Center (RBC), which regulates train traffic on a track segment by ensuring a safe distance based on the positions of the trains, which enter and leave the segment while adhering to a maximum train limit.

We introduce a model that accounts for incoming and outgoing trains using additional constants named 'first' and 'last,' representing the indices of the first and last trains on the track at any time. When considering locality properties and the fact that the number of trains is constrained within a finite set of integer values, we ensure that decidability is maintained despite introducing sorted multiplication.

The paper also discusses a locality-based proof that involves extending partial models to total models by exploiting the density of real numbers and finiteness of integers within any given range. This procedure ultimately leads to a total model of our theory.

To apply locality, we build a set without ground subterms rooted at 'pos', except for two ground terms, ensuring the set only consists of two instances. This process aligns with our goal to simplify the verification problem by reducing it to checking the satisfiability of a set of linear real constraints, which can greatly assist in automated verification of systems categorized by axioms guarded by simple, non-overlapping, and comprehensive premises. 

Overall, our approach potentially simplifies the verification process for a range of problems in systems verification, particularly when diverse, distinct scenarios need to be accounted for.
