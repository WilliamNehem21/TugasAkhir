The research indicates that a significant majority of students – around three-quarters – learn more effectively with the aid of visuals like images and charts, which can be particularly useful in programming where constructing visual problem solutions or diagrams before writing the actual code can enhance comprehension. Applying this approach to data structures, using visual aids to represent the various states of data structures could improve understanding. This suggests that a tool capable of visually representing both theoretical and practical aspects of data structures would be advantageous for learners.

Upon examining over twenty-one data structure visualization tools, the study found that the vast majority are designed to aid conceptual understanding, with fewer than a third assisting with implementation-level insights, such as program understanding and debugging. None of the available tools for the implementation aspect met all the desired criteria.

As Java programs run, they generate a range of objects derived from both the programmers' own classes as well as from those within libraries. These objects, which exist only during program execution, can be difficult to comprehend, especially when they are complex. Although some programmers may mentally visualize simple objects, there is a clear benefit to having the means to see more concrete representations of these objects in real-time as the program operates. This underscores the value of a visualization tool that could help programmers better understand their code while it is executing.
