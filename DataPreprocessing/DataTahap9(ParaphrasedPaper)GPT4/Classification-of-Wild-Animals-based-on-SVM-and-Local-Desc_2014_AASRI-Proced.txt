This paper introduces a new method for recognizing objects using a hybrid combination of established local descriptors, such as Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) and Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF). By integrating different feature extraction techniques, the method shows promise in classifying large animals commonly found in Slovakia, including wolves, foxes, brown bears, deer, and wild boars, and could potentially be applied to other image recognition tasks. The paper also covers the development of a classification model created from a dataset of animal images, describing in detail the feature extraction process which includes common methods like SIFT and SURF, as well as two hybrid methods, SURF-SIFT (SUSIFT) and SIFT-SURF (SISURF).

Key points in images are detected using conventional methods, as well as the proposed hybrids, and are characterized by features that describe the classes for the classification task. The paper details two stages of creating a classification model: first, training data is used to configure the model's parameters, followed by testing to evaluate its accuracy on unknown objects. The authors employ a combination of the Bag-of-Keypoints method and Support Vector Machines (SVMs), specifically using the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel. They explore both brute force and FLANN-based matchers in their experiments.

Implementing these methods within the OpenCV library in C++, the authors experiment with varying numbers of descriptors per class in the vocabulary construction and classifier training. The results show that an algorithm combining the SISURF detector, opponentSIFT descriptor, and brute force matcher, with 15,000 descriptors per class, achieved the highest classification success rate of 86%. SISURF proved competitive, even outperforming standard detectors in some tests, while the SUSIFT detector underperformed with a success rate around 50%.
