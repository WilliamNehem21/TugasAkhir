In summary, the paper discusses the development and initial implementation of a personalized decision support system (DSS) within the myAirCoach platform, aiming at enhancing asthma self-management through mobile apps. The DSS utilizes a novel multi-model approach for short-term prediction of asthma control status, and it offers personalized guidance to patients.

The approach employs machine learning techniques, such as support vector machines (SVM), random forests, AdaBoost, and Bayesian networks, which have demonstrated usefulness for classifying asthma control levels and predicting exacerbation risks. These models are fed with clinical parameters and patient self-reported data such as the Asthma Control Diary (ACD) scores to generate daily and real-time personalized advice and notifications.

The study focuses on improving the way asthma is monitored by considering multiple parameters rather than just one (like ACD or FEV1), and it emphasizes the importance of personalized short-term predictions. Different data preprocessing methods and annotation rules are explored to optimize performance.

A dataset collected from 76 patients, comprising ACD questionnaires, medication usage, FeNO measurements, and spirometry data, is used to train and test the algorithms. Despite inconsistencies in data collection, the paper reports the random forests algorithm showed the best accuracy of 80.41% for predicting asthma control status when the data included consistent daily ACD reports and employed a modified annotation method.

The paper concludes with the results of the DSS, acknowledges limitations of the study, and suggests future directions for enhancing asthma management through mHealth and machine learning.
