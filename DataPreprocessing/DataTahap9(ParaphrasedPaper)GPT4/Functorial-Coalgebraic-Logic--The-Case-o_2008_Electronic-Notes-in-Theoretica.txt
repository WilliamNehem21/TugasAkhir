This section is centered on an algebraic analysis of logics designed for coalgebras. The main concept is that, similar to how coalgebras are formulated with respect to a functor T, typically operating on the category of sets, logics tailored for coalgebras are also established through a functor L, often acting on the category of Boolean algebras. The paper presents an example that demonstrates how traditional presentations of logics for coalgebras naturally lead to a functor on BA, the category of Boolean algebras.

The text also mentions variations in coproduct structures, highlighting that these would require using a distinct functor from L. Instead of changing functors, an alternative strategy is proposed: to focus on the free L-algebra constructed over different presheaves of variables. One explicit case involves a presheaf of variables denoted by W.
