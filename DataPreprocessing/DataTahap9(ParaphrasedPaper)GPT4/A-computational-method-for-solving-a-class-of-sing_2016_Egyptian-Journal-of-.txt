The researchers discussed the resolution of singular boundary value problems using techniques rooted in reproducing kernel spaces, as meticulously outlined in references [6,7]. Mohsen and El-Gamel explored both Galerkin and collocation techniques for solving two-point boundary value issues, while Secer and Kurulay detailed the sinc-Galerkin method specifically for singular Dirichlet-type boundary value problems. Additionally, Rashidinia and colleagues recommended a robust parametric spline approach for these problems.

The structure of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 revisits the essential characteristics of Bernstein polynomials and devises the Bernstein operational matrix for differentiation. Section 3 is dedicated to the implementation of solution methodologies for singular boundary value challenges. Section 4 showcases numerical examples to demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed algorithm. Finally, the paper concludes with Section 5.
