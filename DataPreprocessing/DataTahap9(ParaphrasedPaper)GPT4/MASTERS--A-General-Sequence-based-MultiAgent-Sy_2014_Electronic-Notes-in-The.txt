The overseer agent possesses complete awareness of the protein's precise three-dimensional shape and is tasked with guiding the search agents to ensure a more effective exploration of space. This overseer agent does not have a physical embodiment within the Cartesian coordinate system, but rather functions externally to influence the three-dimensional space. The overseer agent is responsible for executing large-scale positional adjustments on the search agents. It's essential to include at least one overseer agent in any given simulation.
