On one hand, advances in artificial intelligence, blockchain, and extended reality technologies have significantly contributed to the Metaverse's development, with AI advancements like deep learning and reinforcement learning proving essential. Blockchain has allowed for a move towards a decentralized Metaverse, while improvements in wearable technology have increased the public's interest in virtual and augmented reality. 

On the other hand, since the Covid-19 pandemic began in 2020, online sectors such as education have seen explosive growth, with predictions that the online education market will rise to $848.12 billion by 2030. This growth has not only propelled technological developments but also fueled the evolution of the Metaverse.

Existing benchmarks mainly focus on particular technology areas, like MLPerf and AIBench for deep learning, or BigDataBench for big data systems. However, these benchmarks fall short in covering the multifaceted nature of the Metaverse's technology, and the complexity of intertwining various technologies complicates the system even further. There's a critical need for a comprehensive benchmark suite to examine these challenges and assess how close current technologies are to realizing the Metaverse with the extant computing, storage, and networking capabilities.

In this study, we define the Metaverse concept from a computing systems perspective, introduce a benchmarking methodology for the system, and present a benchmark suite called MetaverseBench. Our system includes the Metaverse's components, technological domains, and specificationsâ€”highlighting aspects such as autonomous computing, immersive experience, decentralized architecture, ubiquitous access, and hyperspace interaction.

Further, we've developed a benchmarking methodology that considers the complexity of the Metaverse and selects representative workloads across different technology domains. We've integrated this methodology into MetaverseBench to systematically evaluate the Metaverse system.

The paper is organized as follows: we review existing Metaverse definitions, introduce our conceptual system, present the benchmarking methodology, describe MetaverseBench, discuss preliminary experiments, and conclude with a summary of related work and future research directions.

In conclusion, the Metaverse concept involves comprehensive system components and relies heavily on technological advancements in AI, big data, extended reality, blockchain, and networking, among others. The realization of the Metaverse requires attention to critical features such as data security, privacy, and network scalability. Our proposal focuses on creating a conceptual system and a benchmark suite to address the multifaceted requirements of the Metaverse and facilitate its development.
