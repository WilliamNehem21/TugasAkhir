Interaction combinators were initially introduced as a means to define a universal interaction net system, capable of emulating all other interaction net systems. The intrinsic universality of these combinators, which also implies their ability to simulate any Turing machine (Turing-completeness), combined with their remarkable simplicity and aesthetically pleasing properties, warrant their study as an independent computational model, independent of their connections to general interaction nets.

In interaction nets, it's possible for wires to have one or both ends not attached to any cell, resulting in a net with what's called a free port. Free ports can be principal, auxiliary, or non-specific based on the port they're connected to on the other end. An example net might have multiple free ports with varying designations, which together make up the netâ€™s interface.

For those familiar with the geometry of interaction (GOI), the concept of wellfoundedness is essentially a more strict version of nilpotency. In GOI semantics, emphasis is placed on specific straight paths which carry a non-zero weight in the dynamic algebra or are considered regular paths in the terminology of Danos and Regnier. It has been shown that if wellfoundedness is redefined using the notion of maximal regular paths - meaning there is a finite number of regular paths - this condition also becomes necessary for a net to be total. Consequently, nilpotency serves as a descriptor of total nets.
