Land serves as a critical resource with profound implications for national development. In Latvia, nearly all the land lies within rural areas. As reported by the State Land Service, at the start of 2012, forests represented around 46.3% and agricultural land 37.3% of the country's total area. Consequently, the efficient exploitation of these lands is essential.

The European Union's focus on development increasingly hinges on the utilization of renewable energy resources, which have seen a significant production surge recently. Given the trajectory, agriculture will become pivotal in providing biomass to renewable energy producers. By 2007, 36% of the EU's biogas production stemmed from agricultural sources. In Germany, around 4000 biogas plants existed by 2008. Similarly, Sweden uses about 3% of its agricultural land for bioenergy, while Denmark anticipates an increase in biogas derived from agriculture by 2020.

From autumn 2010, Latvia's Rural Support Service began monitoring agricultural land usage and informing local authorities about the extra property tax rate (1.5%). Regulations mandate that land be maintained following agricultural and environmental standards to be taxed according to these criteria.

Annually, Latvia could produce 26 million tons of silage, with the potential to generate 4.8 million mÂ³ of biogas or 1200 MW of electricity. To realize this, constructing 2400 new biogas plants, each with a 500 kW capacity, is essential. Such expansion could bolster rural development, job creation, tax revenue, environmental protection through reduced greenhouse emissions, and diversify farmers' income. It would also decrease fertilizer expenses and improve agricultural practices, such as enhancing crop rotation to prevent monocultures, along with the utilization of thermal energy.

By aligning Latvia's agricultural productivity and efficiency with EU-12 levels, there is an opportunity to double food output and augment electricity from agricultural biomass by 22 times the current level. This would require approximately 2400 new biogas facilities. As such, Latvia holds the potential to diversify its economy through both enhanced food production and the development of renewable energy resources.
