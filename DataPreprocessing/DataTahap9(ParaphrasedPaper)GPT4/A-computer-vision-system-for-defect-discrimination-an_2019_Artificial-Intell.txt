The prevailing approach to sorting and grading produce such as tomatoes is traditionally done by hand, a method that is often imprecise, laborious, and subjective (Karlsson, 2016). To address these drawbacks, Gould (1975) introduced an automated mechanical sorting machine for tomatoes, although it could only categorize fruit based on size and weight. Advances in machine vision technology have since allowed for precise, non-invasive grading based on the detection systems offered by this technology.

In the referenced study, the LAB color space was chosen for its consistency and diminished variance due to sensor sensitivity. LAB is a three-dimensional color representation system that provides absolute color values. Texture, classified here as a second-order statistic, represents the spatial interdependence of pixel intensity values. Haralick features, derived from gray-level co-occurrence matrices (GLCM), were calculated by averaging the GLCM in four directions (0°, 45°, 90°, and 135°) with a neighborhood distance of 1, to capture any non-directional defects. Important textural characteristics include contrast, correlation, energy, homogeneity, and entropy.

From each image, fifteen features were identified, which then formed the basis of four different quality grading models for each classification approach considered. This included various configurations of support vector machines (linear, quadratic, cubic, and radial basis function), artificial neural networks (ANN), decision trees, and random forests. These models were refined through 10-fold cross-validation during training and subsequently evaluated on a separate testing dataset.

The ANN models used in this study were comprised of an input layer with fifteen nodes corresponding to the extracted features, a hidden layer with ten neurons—determined to be optimal through testing—and an output layer. A hyperbolic tangent sigmoid function enabled processing in the hidden layer, while a linear function was employed in the output layer.

Regarding the discrimination of tomatoes by ripeness, Lee et al. (2008) had earlier developed a near-infrared imaging system to grade date fruits with a high accuracy of 95.0%. Although high-quality imaging techniques such as hyperspectral, multispectral, and near-infrared can be quite expensive to set up, the system presented in this study was similarly capable of achieving high accuracy under controlled lighting conditions, despite being sensitive to ambient light.

Assessment of the classification results yielded a specificity of 0.9613, a precision of 0.9742, and a sensitivity of 0.9775 on the testing set. The metrics were based on true positives (TP), true negatives (TN), false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN).

The study put forward a proposal for a machine vision system to identify defects in cherry and heirloom tomatoes by analyzing image color, texture, and shape features. A model linking image LAB color space values to possible defects was developed. While the results indicate the system's potential utility, further validation across different tomato varieties is necessary.

Lastly, Naik, Patel, & Pandey (2015) conducted research on non-destructive mango grading, which extracted shape, size, and maturity features and classified them using a fuzzy classifier, presented at the 2015 IEEE conference on technological innovation for agriculture and rural development (TIAR).
