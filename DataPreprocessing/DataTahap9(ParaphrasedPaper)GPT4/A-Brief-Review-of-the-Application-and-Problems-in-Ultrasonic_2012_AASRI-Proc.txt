Unlike traditional fatigue samples that are clamped at both ends, one end of an ultrasonic fatigue sample is attached to an amplifying horn while the other end is left free. For accurate ultrasonic fatigue testing, the sample must be in resonance with the testing system. If u(x, t) represents the longitudinal section displacement at time t along the specimen's x-axis, the resonant length of such a specimen can be calculated accordingly.

Advances in industrial technology have led to a need for high design fatigue life for many metal components, making the study of high-cycle fatigue properties of metallic materials increasingly important. Ultrasonic fatigue testing has emerged as a useful tool in this research area. Although there are challenges that need to be addressed in high-cycle fatigue testing, overcoming them gradually and establishing standards for very high-cycle fatigue tests in the future will likely result in widespread adoption of ultrasonic fatigue testing methods.
