The problem of assessing the reliability of a binary-state system modeled by a combinatorial graph has been a significant research focus since the 1960s. In this graph-based model, the system's elements are represented by edges that can either fail or function properly, while the nodes are seen as faultless connection points. Despite the individual components failing independently, solving this problem has been proven to be computationally difficult, specifically, an NP-complete challenge. Researchers have created numerous algorithms to address the issue which generally fall under various categories.

The discussed section of the paper presents a detailed description of a specific improved algorithm. This algorithm creates a new output file, denoted as fnext, based on the data from an input file, fprev, at each stage of recursion. The procedure begins by initializing the graph, setting up the files, and arranging relevant mappings. Once the setup is complete, the algorithm proceeds to analyze the initial graph.

To begin with, it checks if the graph is connected. If connectivity is confirmed, the algorithm identifies opportunities for simplifying the graph through reductions. Any changes to the probabilities resulting from the reductions are updated. The alterations made to the graph and the reductions are recorded as strings. In addition, these strings include not only the changes but also the related subproblems identified by analyzing the shortest path. Ultimately, this information, encapsulated within the string, is stored in the file fnext.
