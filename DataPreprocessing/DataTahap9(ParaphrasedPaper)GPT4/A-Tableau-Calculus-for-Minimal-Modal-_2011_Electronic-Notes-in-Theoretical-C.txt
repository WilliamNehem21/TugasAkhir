This paper addresses model generation and its specific application in finding the smallest models within various logics, which is valuable for fault analysis, system verification, and data model validation. Although there are established methods for minimization in classical logics, similar research for non-classical logics like multi-modal logic is sparse.

The authors discuss a new approach for generating minimal models in multi-modal logics, particularly in K(M) and its extensions with axioms T and B. Their proposed calculus is designed to produce only minimal modal Herbrand models, ensuring each model is unique. An innovative aspect of their approach is a non-standard complement splitting rule that assists in minimal model generation. This rule also helps reduce the potential search space, as demonstrated by experimental results.

Existing model minimization techniques for classical logics are categorized into three groups: one targets reducing the domain of interpretation, another the interpretation of specific predicates, and the third aims at minimizing the interpretation of all predicates. In contrast, for modal logics and their related description logics, minimal model generation is not as explored, with most attention going to logics with non-monotonic operators and non-monotonic semantics, focusing again on predicate minimization.

The paper further explains their 'SBR' (selection-based resolution) approach, which is a substitution for the positive unit hyperresolution rule. The SBR method maintains soundness and completeness in generating minimal models. The authors highlight that while their new calculus, named 3MG, shares similarities with existing methods, it does not directly correspond to them. To establish soundness and completeness, they show that the calculi are approximations of each other through a complex translation between modal formulas and first-order clauses. This unique translation reduces the search space while applying the pre-existing approach to clauses generated by the standard translation.

They suggest that future improvements could include lazy clausification, which would not impact theoretical complexity but could provide practical benefits in realistic implementations. The authors clarify that the current work avoids lazy clausification to straightforwardly prove soundness and completeness in relation to the existing clausal approach.
