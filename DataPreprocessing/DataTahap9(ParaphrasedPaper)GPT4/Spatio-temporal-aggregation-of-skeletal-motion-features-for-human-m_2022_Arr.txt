The paper discusses the importance of spatial aggregation in the generalization of motion features for each joint and the spatial dependencies between joints. Generalizing motion features means recognizing common features across different joints so that, for example, motions observed in the right knee can be applied to the left knee. It also involves capturing relationships among joints, such as how the shoulder, elbow, and wrist work together to guide the fingertips along a straight line trajectory.

Previous methods for expressing spatial dependency have used network structures like graph convolution and attention to create a graph where each joint is a node, producing separate joint-wise features and spatial inter-joint dependencies. However, these approaches can struggle with referencing distant joints within a motion tree structure. Some studies, like Wei et al., have proposed learning the adjacency matrix to reference distant joints, but this lacks information on original connections, leading to challenges with capturing global features. On the other hand, Li et al. introduced a multi-scale graph to merge close joints to better capture wide-area features, though the selection of joints to integrate is heuristic and subjective, and there's still an issue with generalizing spatial dependence.

The paper underscores that different data descriptions – position-based and angle-based – have been treated as distinct problems. Position-based descriptions, which are focused on the relative positions of joints, are better at capturing the wide-ranging interlocking of distant joints, while angle-based descriptions excel in representing local actions at individual joints.

The authors present an approach that combines angle-based descriptions for features held by each joint node and position-based descriptions for spatial dependencies during feature aggregation. The paper discusses the use of an attention mechanism with both absolute and relative positional encodings to capture joint and temporal information distinctly.

For evaluation, the paper employs the Mean Per Joint Position Error (MPJPE), comparing prediction times across various intervals and benchmarking the proposed method against previous techniques. The findings show that removing the position-based description compromises long-term prediction accuracy, as it's important for detecting global body features, while omitting the angle-based description impacts short-term predictions due to its role in detecting local joint features.

The study concludes that their proposed method, by correctly leveraging position and angle data structures, outperforms state-of-the-art methods in short-term motion prediction. This approach takes advantage of the strengths of both position-based and angle-based data to improve prediction accuracy for complex motions. 

Finally, the paper references Vaswani et al.'s seminal work "Attention is All You Need" in the context of the attention mechanism's role in the proposed methodology for aggregating time and joint data.
