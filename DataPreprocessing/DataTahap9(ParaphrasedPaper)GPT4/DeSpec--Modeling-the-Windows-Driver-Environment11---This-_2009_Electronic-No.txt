In recent times, there has been a growing focus on validating the reliability of Windows kernel drivers, as their stability is critically important for the integrity of the entire operating system. Microsoft has been at the forefront, creating several tools for testing drivers, including their recent innovation, the Static Driver Verifier (SDV). The SDV employs model checking, a verification method that is highly dependent on the quality of the environmental models used. Current tools, however, suffer from two main issues: the environmental models are excessively indeterminate, which undermines the precision of the model checker's findings, and they are oversimplified, thereby missing out on the chance to verify more nuanced properties of the drivers. These models also fail to provide a formalized or easily comprehensible specification that could serve as useful documentation.

To address these shortcomings, the paper introduces a new language for both formally specifying and modeling kernel drivers and their environment. This language, DESPEC, acts as a connector between specific C language constructs and their corresponding models in the Zing language. DESPEC helps to encapsulate models of C constructs like pointers and unions, which are not natively represented in Zing, and it does this without the need to rework existing specifications.

DESPEC is syntactically akin to C#, structured into namespaces containing various declarations like classes, enumerated types, and method groups. In DESPEC, classes are not just collections of fields and methods, but can also include rules, which use temporal logic to impose constraints on class members.

An emphasis is made on the difference between synthetic and non-synthetic language elements within DESPEC. For example, synthetic classes do not contain abstract mappings of kernel functions and mainly exist for modeling purposes.

The process of specifying kernel functions is detailed, highlighting how DESPEC handles parameters and method references, with particular attention to the use of placeholder tokens and instance arguments. Patterns and scopes are also touched upon, explaining how temporal logic is applied within the language.

The paper further explains that once a model is selected, a model extractor will create a Zing model from the C source code of the driver and kernel headers. This combined model is typically too vast for verification, necessitating a slicing procedure to only retain relevant fragments for verification.

Beyond model checking, other techniques like Microsoft's Prefast are used to statically analyze source code for common error patterns, though these are limited to the scope of individual functions and may miss certain types of errors or produce false negatives.

Throughout the paper, the structure and application of DESPEC are elucidated, and it is positioned as a noteworthy advance in the modeling and verification of Windows kernel drivers, potentially improving driver safety and system stability.
