The complexity of multi-agent systems (MAS) is growing, making their verification and validation a crucial task. This paper demonstrates the adaptation of the model checking technique, a proven verification method, to handle the complexities of multi-agent systems. The work presented in the paper focuses on a specific type of multi-agent system, characterized by agents that possess beliefs (B), desires (D), and intentions (I).

A specialized branching-time logic called BDI-CTL (Belief, Desire, Intention - Computation Tree Logic) is utilized, incorporating a possible-worlds framework grounded in decision theory. This logic employs propositional structures to represent the agents' mental states across different possible worlds. Each world is considered a tree, with each "situation" in a tree being a snapshot of the world that includes subsets of accessible worlds based on the agentâ€™s beliefs, desires, and intentions.

The challenge addressed in the paper is to extend standard model checking by incorporating the definition of possible worlds and establishing relationships between them. The authors propose a method that reduces the time taken to specify these relationships by automatically synthesizing agents' mental attitudes. A dedicated sub-language is introduced for specifying the multi-agent systems, and a tool is developed to build state spaces for each agent. An algorithm then synthesizes agent models, creating a possible worlds model used for verification.

For verifying the synthesized models, standard model checking with an implemented symbolic model checking tool is used. The initial results from this verification show great potential, according to the authors.

The paper is organized into sections: first, it describes the BDI-CTL logic, then introduces the specification sub-language and defines the associated temporal logic semantics. Next, it discusses the algorithm for model synthesis, followed by an expanded model checking algorithm. The final section summarizes the results, outlines future research directions, and concludes the findings.

In essence, BDI-CTL extends the CTL logic to account for agents' mental states, allowing reasoning about how these states influence agents to satisfy their desires. The paper provides a practical approach to MAS verification, including a programming language for developing MAS, formal semantics via BDI-CTL, and a process for systematically constructing agent state spaces. The main contribution lies in generating possible worlds structures based on agents' mental states, facilitating the verification of multi-agent systems.
