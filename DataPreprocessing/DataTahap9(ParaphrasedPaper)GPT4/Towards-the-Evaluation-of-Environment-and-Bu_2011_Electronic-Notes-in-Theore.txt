The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is an established methodology for evaluating the environmental impacts associated with a product's lifecycle. Commercial software, such as SimaPro, calculates environmental metrics like Global Warming Potential (GWP) using conversion databases that track resource consumption. These tools, however, are not designed to evaluate performance aspects, such as machine utilization or reliability, which are outside the scope of LCA.

Exergy analysis, rooted in the Second Law of Thermodynamics, quantifies the potential of energy to perform work and has been used to assess the efficiency of energy use in systems and processes. There have been attempts to integrate exergy with LCA to form a composite sustainability indicator, but a challenge remains in capturing the complete exergy flows of resources used in production.

For system evaluation, both qualitative and quantitative, stochastic models are widely used. These models are particularly suitable for systems with at least one probabilistically distributed variable and are often represented through rigorous mathematical equations. Additionally, queuing networks, Markov chains, and Petri nets may also be used for such stochastic modeling.

The paper proposes using Stochastic Reward Nets (SRNs) for environmental impact assessment and business metrics. Reward functions are appended to the SRN's transitions and places, yielding performance indicators for each state of the model. In this approach, a resource's classification as an energy source, raw material, or waste is crucial for accurately measuring GWP and exergy output, with the aim of preventing excessively complex assessments.

It's important to note that, while reward definitions don't distinguish between SRN places, they should be defined at such granular levels to gain insights into specific processes. The paper illustrates SRN models for facilities and processes within supply chains and manufacturing systems based on a modular, bottom-up modeling philosophy, which are designed to allow steady-state or transient evaluations.

A case study in a Brazilian meat processing factory demonstrates this modeling approach, focusing on energy consumption, waste generation, and machine failures. The impacts of failures on both system performance and environmental metrics were considered, highlighting that failure rates affect not only availability but also system efficiency.

The research showed the value of evaluating GWP and exergetic indicators in manufacturing systems and supply chains through stochastic models. It underscored the importance of considering energy sources and their location-specific impacts on these metrics, as factors such as electricity GWP can vary greatly by country. By providing detailed resource information, the model can facilitate cost analyses and help balance cost-environment trade-offs.

Overall, the proposed method leverages a single model to assess both environmental and performance indicators using Stochastic Petri Nets. This approach not only calculates the likelihood of exceeding certain indicator thresholds but also supports higher-level component definitions that are not possible with methods like Markov chains, allowing for comprehensive system modeling.
