The study of social network mining encompasses two primary facets: the exploration of structural characteristics and the analysis of content. A particularly important challenge within this domain is identifying the most influential members in a social network, with implications for effective viral marketing campaigns by targeting those individuals to promote new products, although finding the key influencers is an NP-hard problem and cannot be solved exactly, necessitating the development of approximation methods with clear guarantees. The greedy algorithm is a foundation for many of these methods, offering decent approximations but at a costly computational price.

To address these challenges, the paper introduces a two-tiered strategy based on the Suspected-Infected (SI) epidemic model to enhance influence spread, highlighting the benefits of a multithreading approach for implementing the SI model, ultimately improving the performance and efficiency of the influence maximization process.

Viral marketing leverages social networks heavily, capitalizing on the social influence inherent in platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Flickr, where selective users with high visibility can set trends and shape opinions. These influencers are key to viral marketing, as they can sway potential customersâ€™ purchase decisions. The goal is to identify optimal candidates within these platforms who can then further influence others, maximizing the spread of information or product adoption.

Recent progress in social network analysis has brought to light metrics that quantify influence and authority, among other network characteristics. Different models, including greedy approaches with approximation guarantees and epidemic models like Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR), have been used to model social diffusion. The SI model is preferred in this research for its progressive nature, which suits the challenge of influence maximization effectively.

In social networks, represented by a graph, the problem is to select a subset of influential individuals (seed set) to maximize the spread of influence. Kempe's triggering model and algorithms like IC and LT have shown that influence maximization is NP-hard, but the diminishing returns of submodularity allow for good approximations.

By considering incremental influence spread approaches and implementing with multithreading, the proposed method improves upon existing strategies both in terms of the extent of influence and computational efficiency. The paper suggests that by leveraging the SI model and focusing on maximizing influence spread with innovative algorithms and execution strategies like multithreading, businesses can more effectively utilize social networks for marketing and information dissemination. It concludes by recognizing the ongoing importance of influencer identification and influence maximization in the context of viral marketing and suggests that continued advancements in social network mining will be valuable for addressing related challenges such as link prediction and content analysis.
