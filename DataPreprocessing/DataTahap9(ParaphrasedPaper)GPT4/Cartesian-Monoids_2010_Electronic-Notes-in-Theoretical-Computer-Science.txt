The statement indicates that the domain of f, denoted as dom(f), is an open set in Cantor space, and the function f, when restricted to its domain dom(f), is an open and continuous function that maps from dom(f) into Cantor space. If the domain of f is the entire Cantor space, then the function f is referred to as total. Additionally, there is mention of the existence of two Cartesian monoids, although further context is required to understand the relationship between these monoids and the function f or Cantor space.
