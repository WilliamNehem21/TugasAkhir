The paper describes Support Vector Machines (SVM), introduced by Cortes and Vapnik in 1995, as a renowned algorithm for classifying data into distinct classes. SVM seeks a hyperplane with the largest margin between classes, with this hyperplane being a type of linear model. For two-class datasets, a hyperplane can effectively separate them into respective groups, and the samples nearest to the hyperplane are known as support vectors. The algorithm adapted for non-linear classification by introducing soft margins, utilizing slack variables to handle data non-linearity.

Feature selection methods, like Correlation-Based Feature Selection (CFS) and Random Forest Importance (RFI), are employed to understand data better, mitigate the curse of high dimensionality, expedite computations, and enhance classifier performance. CFS identifies a subset of relevant features with high class correlation but low inter-feature correlation. RFI ranks features based on importance, utilizing the Random Forest algorithm's assessment.

The study employs 10-fold cross-validation to evaluate SVM's performance on 83 samples, which involves training on nine folds and testing on the remaining one iteratively. The classification's efficacy is measured by the mean accuracy across all tests. Distinctions between certain classes were observed, noting overlaps between others.

Different SVM models were identified by a set of input variables and their corresponding accuracy. The best-performing model utilized nine variables with approximately 94% accuracy, whereas using a single variable yielded around 68.49% accuracy; the addition of variables improved accuracy up to a certain point.

The study highlighted that not all variables contribute equally to the classification model, and a full chemical profile led to low predictive performance with unclear PCA plot separation. Selecting an appropriate feature subset was crucial for classifying South American wines. A combination of seven phenolic and two volatile compounds, including ORAC, which had been previously singled out by feature selection, proved effective for separating various South American wines. This aligns with a separate study by Zhang et al. (2010), where stepwise linear discriminant analysis identified key volatiles for classifying Chinese red wine varieties.
