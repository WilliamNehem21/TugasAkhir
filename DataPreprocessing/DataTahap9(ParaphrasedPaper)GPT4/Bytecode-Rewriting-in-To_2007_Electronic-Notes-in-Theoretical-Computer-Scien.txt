In this paper, the authors introduce a library based on term rewriting for the manipulation of Java bytecode. They leverage an extension of Java called Tom, which enhances Java with pattern matching capabilities, to create expressive transformation rules. Tom's strength lies in its strategy language, which enables intricate tree traversals and guides the transformation rule application. Additionally, the library uses CTL (Computation Tree Logic) formulae to define conditions for transformations, ensuring their satisfiability.

The authors argue that traditional Java bytecode manipulation libraries, like SERP, BCEL, and ASM, are powerful yet require a deep understanding of their APIs. Their proposed abstraction layer uses term rewriting to facilitate the definition of high-level transformations and analyses, improving expressiveness and reducing programming errors.

The core concept is to map bytecode programs to algebraic terms, which can then be manipulated by rewriting rules. An algebraic signature representing bytecode programs is defined, encompassing more than 250 constructors. This signature allows the representation of Java class elements like fields and methods as algebraic terms.

The unique aspect of the Tom system is its independence from specific languages and data structures. It operates as a compiler translating matching constructs into the native language of the host, which is Java in this context.

The paper also discusses how the library leverages strategies resembling CTL formulae to analyze control flow without creating an actual control flow graph in memory, saving on computational resources.

As a practical application, the authors detail how their library can be employed for secure class loading, ensuring that I/O operations are redirected to a secure API by rewriting bytecode at load time.

In summary, the library presented in the paper offers a novel approach to Java bytecode manipulation through strategic rewriting, providing an abstraction that simplifies analysis and transformations while maintaining efficiency. This method improves the reliability of the transformed code and enables security enhancements in the JVM through bytecode rewriting at the class loader level.
