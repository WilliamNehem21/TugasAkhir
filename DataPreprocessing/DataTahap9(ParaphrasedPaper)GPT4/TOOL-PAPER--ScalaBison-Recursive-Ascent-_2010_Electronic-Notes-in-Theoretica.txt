Modern LL parser generators enhance LL parsing by allowing grammar authors to integrate code to resolve ambiguous scenarios. This is feasible due to the natural understanding of top-down parsing methods. However, this approach has a downside: as grammars incorporate more implementation specifics, their clarity diminishes. In contrast, Bison, with its extensions for handling precedence, offers a means to create grammars that are both neat and expressive.

The crucial method for left-corner parsing involves identifying each grammar production's recognition points - the moments at which ambiguities are clarified. Horspool expands on this idea by introducing the concept of "free positions," which are places where semantic actions can be executed. While every recognition point qualifies as a free position, the converse isn't always true; sometimes non-free positions emerge after an initial free position. In this work, we focus on the earliest free position without subsequent non-free positions as the optimal recognition point.
