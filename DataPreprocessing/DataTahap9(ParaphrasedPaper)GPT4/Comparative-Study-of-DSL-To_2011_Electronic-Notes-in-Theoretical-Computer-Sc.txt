This scholarly paper addresses the diverse array of methods currently employed to create domain-specific languages (DSLs), noting that there's no clear consensus in the field on which method or methods are best suited for particular problems. The authors postulate that this confusion stems largely from a general lack of understanding within the DSL community. The paper aims to shed light on the relative advantages and disadvantages of four distinct approaches by applying them to a shared DSL case study.

The paper specifically examines MPS and the Intentional Domain Workbench (IDW), which both serve as examples of advanced toolsets providing integrated development environments (IDEs) for base languages needed for DSL development. Using these tools, developers can build and integrate DSLs to create specialized applications.

The case study focuses on a state machine language DSL, leveraging this controlled example to facilitate comparison of the DSL implementation methods. These include ANTLR, Ruby, Stratego, and Converge, all of which are explored in separate sections of the paper. Section 8 compares the approaches, examining them across various dimensions and metrics, while Section 9 delves into the authors' own experiences, delineating the strengths and weaknesses of each tool.

The paper further describes how ANTLR serves as a parser generator tool for building language translators, while Ruby allows for blocks of code to be wrapped and passed around as objects for later execution. The use of transformation rules in Stratego, including a unique "where" clause for dynamic rule application, is also detailed.

The authors highlight the importance of syntactic and semantic well-formedness in generating target programs and note how the various tools report errors at different stages of development. They also discuss the potential for reusability within grammar definitions and transformation modules in the context of each tool.

By evaluating the different approaches, the paper discerns that while each has its own merits and limitations, no single approach is universally applicable. It concludes with the hope that their comparisons and insights could help guide future DSL implementations.
