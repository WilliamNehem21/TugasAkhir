This paper introduces an advanced method for controlling the behavior of rewrite rules in term rewriting systems through the use of scoped dynamic rules. Standard solutions for rewrite rule application often result in strategy bloat, carrying excessive environmental data for use by transformation rules. This approach addresses the problem by facilitating the generation of rewrite rules at runtime. These dynamic rules can access variables from the context in which they were defined and are only active within a specific scope. When that scope ends, the rules are automatically retracted.

The paper showcases the benefits of this methodology through several program transformations, such as renaming bound variables, inlining functions, and eliminating dead functions. Rewriting strategies serve as small programs that select and apply rules to an abstract syntax tree without contaminating individual rules with strategic details, allowing rules to remain modular and reusable.

Using the Stratego language for illustration, the paper explains how dynamic rules in term rewriting systems can be combined with global tree traversal strategies to provide a powerful, flexible means of specifying term transformations. Scoped and overriding dynamic rules can manage the visibility and applicability of these rules to ensure correctness and meet the specific constraints of a given transformation.

Applications for dynamic rules are vast, going beyond simple transformations to include runtime configuration of transformation components and influencing strategies like memoization and inter-procedural transformations. Finally, the paper compares dynamic rules with similar constructs such as Prolog's assert and retract, emphasizing the cleaner control of rule scopes without explicit retraction.

In summary, the paper presents a significant advance in managing the complexity of term rewriting systems, which expands their expressiveness and applicability without increasing the burden on the traversal strategy or limiting the use of standard program representations like abstract syntax trees.
