Before we attempt to verify Theorem 2.2, we simplify the claim. Employing reasoning similar to that used by Hasegawa, Hofmann, and Plotkin, we can focus exclusively on terms m, n which comply with certain specific conditions labeled as {A1, A2, A4}. We designate [B]]m as a 2-dimensional Hilbert space composed of an orthonormal basis denoted by {B3, B5}. It's important to note that the selection of the basis vectors' labels is intentional, to imply a direct relationship between the basis vectors of [A]]m and the wires named A in the structural layout of m, and this applies as well to [B]]m.
