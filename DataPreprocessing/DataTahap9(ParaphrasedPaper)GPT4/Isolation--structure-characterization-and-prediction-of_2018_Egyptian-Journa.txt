The recent research has discovered that the plant known as D. viscosa has potent antiviral and antimicrobial properties, adding to its recognized uses as a spasmolytic and hypotensive agent. Studies have shown that its leaves contain compounds with effects similar to a local anesthetic, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and anti-ulcerogenic agents, among others. Despite these findings, there has been little research on the variety of D. viscosa found in Oman. As this plant holds strong medicinal value, it is now being commercially grown in various parts of the world, including Oman. To further understand its potential, an exploration of the biological activity of the Omani D. viscosa was conducted, specifically looking at abundance in regions like Al Jabal Al Akhdar and Al Hamra.

Leaves from the Omani D. viscosa were collected for study in September 2016 from Al-Hamra and were identified by local experts and confirmed via an online database before being processed at the University of Nizwa's research laboratory. Following collection, they were cleaned, with leaves separated from stems and dried in shade for a week.

The most potent antioxidant components were then extracted using hexane and ethyl acetate, and further purification was carried out using column chromatography and preparative thin-layer chromatography (PTLC), with multiple fractions being isolated and combined based on their chromatographic profiles. These refined fractions were then subjected to advanced structural analysis through mass spectrometry (MS) and both one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to determine their chemical structures.

This scientific inquiry is aligned with a broader, global effort by researchers to identify and harness naturally occurring substances with significant medicinal propertiesâ€”particularly those that offer therapeutic benefits with minimal side effects. The plant in question, as with many medicinal plants, contains a spectrum of chemical constituents with various biological activities, including antioxidant, antimicrobial, anticandidal, antidiabetic, antifungal, and antidiarrheal effects. Traditionally, the leaves have been used to treat conditions like itching, swellings, and aches.

Notably, pure compounds were isolated from the extracts and identified through comprehensive analysis. For example, Compound 2, derived from hexane extract, was crystallized and analyzed, revealing a molecular weight of 442, corresponding to the formula C29H50O2. Its structure was further elucidated by various types of NMR, confirming its unique chemical attributes.
