The structure of the paper is outlined as follows: initially, the paper examines a calculus that does not include storage, along with its corresponding categorical and game semantics. Subsequently, the paper applies a similar analysis to a calculus that incorporates storage. During the course of the discussion, there is a need to establish the theory of expansions in Section 3.1, which is crucial for articulating an injective renaming lemma.

The paper includes Definition 3.2, which is as follows: Assume we have a Cartesian category 'A' that possesses a strict initial object. 'A' is said to possess non-singular quotients if for every morphism emanating from a non-initial object, there exists a quotient. This quotient must be singular in the sense that it is determined uniquely up to a unique morphism, which also implies uniqueness up to isomorphism by convention.
