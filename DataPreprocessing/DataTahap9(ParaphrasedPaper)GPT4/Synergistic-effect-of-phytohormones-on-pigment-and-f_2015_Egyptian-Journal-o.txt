The study examines how plant hormones regulate plant adaptation to environmental changes, particularly focusing on the impacts of seawater salinity and growth regulators like gibberellic acid (GA3), indole acetic acid (IAA), and abscisic acid (ABA) on wheat. It finds that at moderate levels, seawater can boost pigment content, including carotenoids, but it also leads to decreases in leaf area, photosynthetic activity, and the levels of sucrose, polysaccharides, and protein. However, wheat pretreated with plant hormones showed improved growth and increased production of chlorophylls and carotenoids. The study also notes that seawater at higher concentrations severely disrupts chloroplast structure, but this effect is mitigated when wheat grains are pre-soaked in GA3, IAA, or ABA, enhancing tolerance to salinity.

The paper also discusses the roles of phytohormones like ABA, ethylene, and salicylic acid in plant stress responses and highlights the need for more research on cytokinins, gibberellins, and auxins in this context. ABA in particular is noted for its role in rapid stress responses like stomatal closure to reduce water loss.

The study detailed methods for preparing wheat grains for experimentation, including sterilizing and soaking in different plant hormone solutions, followed by examining the plants' leaf ultrastructure using electron microscopy. It confirmed that chloroplasts are highly sensitive to stress from seawater salinity, which can cause extensive damage to their membranes and increase cytoplasmic vacuolation.

Finally, grain priming with plant hormones is suggested to potentially delay leaf senescence, maintain green foliage, and enhance overall tolerance to saline conditions by promoting healthy chloroplast function and pigment production.

To summarize, the research highlights the complex interplay between salinity stress, plant growth regulators, and the physiological and structural responses of wheat, demonstrating how strategic use of plant hormones can mitigate the negative effects of environmental stressors on plants.
