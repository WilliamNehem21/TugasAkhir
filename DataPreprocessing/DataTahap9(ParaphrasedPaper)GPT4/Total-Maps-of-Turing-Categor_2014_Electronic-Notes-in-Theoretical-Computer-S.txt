The paper discusses the relevance of Turing categories for understanding computability and complexity theory and investigates whether the total maps of a Turing category can correspond to complexity classes like linear time functions. By questioning the potential for Turing categories to precisely capture these maps, the paper explores the applicability of these categories in examining computational limitations at low complexity levels.

The research presented delves into the mechanisms by which a Turing category can encapsulate a given Cartesian category and provides a method for achieving this encapsulation. It introduces two key concepts: the Yoneda embedding - which allows for the creation of a canonical category of partial maps - and the usage of stack machines in the presheaf category to produce a partial combinatory algebra. This algebra then gives rise to the desired Turing category, with the stack machine serving as an augmented form of combinatory logic's canonical rewrite system.

The paper begins by addressing how a category can emerge as a subcategory of total maps within any restriction category, and postulates conditions under which a Cartesian category may be completely represented by a Turing category's total maps. The authors argue that for a category to be considered the total maps of a Turing category, it must be cartesian (possess finite products) and meet additional technical conditions that simplify in practical scenarios.

Additionally, the paper clarifies the concept of preinitial objects within a category – those that have at most one map to any other object – and contrasts these with strict preinitial objects. An example is provided to illustrate that a category with a universal object might still fail to be the total maps of a Turing category, as seen in the special case of a meet-semilattice.

A key point of interest in the paper isn't just the question of how total maps relate to Turing categories, but also the novel methods used to answer this question. In particular, these methods involve the establishment of compatibility between components within a stack object so that the step partial function can be well-defined.

To connect the abstract concept of computability in Turing categories with practical computational complexity classes (such as linear time, log space, polynomial time, etc.), it's important to know whether these functional classes can form the total maps of a Turing category. Previous work has demonstrated that it is possible for log space and polynomial time functions to be described naturally as the total maps of Turing categories. This was made possible by leveraging the fact that transducers and Turing machines can simulate themselves with resource overheads that still fit within the boundaries of log space and polynomial time. Unfortunately, such modeling does not readily extend to linear time functions, as there currently isn't an accepted machine model that can self-simulate within a linear time framework.
