This paper focuses on a new area within classical normal modal logic, specifically addressing the study of non-monotonic interactive proofs. It introduces and explores a new form of modal logic called the Logic of Disjunctive Interactive Proofs (LDIIP), which handles negation-complete and consequently disjunctive interactive proofs. Additionally, it compares this new logic to an existing Logic of Interactive Proofs (LIIP), which is suited for non-disjunctive and therefore negation-incomplete interactive proofs.

The paper's primary inspiration for developing LDIIP arises both from theoretical interests and practical considerations, specifically the desire to expand upon interactive proofs to include negation-complete scenarios. The broader objective for introducing LDIIP is to contribute to the foundations of interactive computation from an intuitionistic perspective, as hinted at in previous programmatic statements on the topic.
