In this paper, we present timed counter systems (TCS), an innovative type of system that combines timing elements (clocks) and iterative elements (counters). These systems inherently have infinite possible states, and determining if a specific state can be reached—known as the reachability problem—is typically not solvable. However, we propose using a regional graph abstraction for clock values that makes solving the counter reachability problem possible for particular TCS subclasses.

Our key contribution is towards the field of system verification, particularly focusing on the reachability aspect. We establish that counter reachability is solvable for certain kinds of TCS by applying a regional graph that corresponds to already decidable counter systems. We point out three such subclasses: timed VASS (Vector Addition Systems with States), bounded timed counter systems, and reversal-bounded timed counter systems.

To examine the behavior of TCS, there are three approaches based on the types of variables analyzed: one that only considers clocks, another that only looks at counters, and a third that encompasses both. These approaches correspond, respectively, to what's known as timed, counting, and full semantics interpretations of a TCS.

Due to the inherent complexity of these systems, the counter reachability problem is, by default, unsolvable for general TCS, as it is even for simpler counter systems (CS). Nonetheless, by imposing certain restrictions that have led to resolvable situations in CS, we are optimistic that some of these conditions can be adapted to TCS.

One crucial advancement of this paper is demonstrating that we can examine TCS through the counting semantics of its regional graph, creating an abstraction focused on counter reachability that is faithful to the system's full dynamics. By synthesizing previously known results from timed automata (TA) and specific CS subclasses, we prove this capacity.

In conclusion, we have introduced a new hybrid model for systems that combine both time and iteration, showing that the counter reachability issue is resolvable for three of its varieties. There is potential for further research into other subclasses, such as flat TCS, with the eventual aim of enhancing the FAST tool to accommodate clocks. Additionally, our findings might be applicable to systems with other data structures besides counters, including pushdown stacks and lossy channels.
