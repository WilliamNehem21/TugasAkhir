In line with global trends, the significance of renewable energy production in Latvia is on the rise. Presently, hydropower constitutes the majority of Latvia's renewable electricity generation, with biomass cogeneration contributing 1%. According to the Energy Strategy 2030, cogeneration using biomass is perceived as a promising way to boost renewable energy output in Latvia. The growth of cogeneration facilities has been significantly supported by EU Structural Funds, Cohesion Fund, and the European Agriculture Fund for Rural Development, supplemented by both Latvian government and EU funding in recent and forthcoming years (2013).

As of now, Latvia houses 23 biogas plants with a collective capacity of 29.92 MW. By 2030, plans are in place to elevate the total capacity to 90 MW, by diversifying biomass resources used for biogas production. With the escalation of biogas generation from agricultural biomass, issues of sustainability, risk assessment, and management are gaining prominence among energy-producing farms.

A flow diagram illustrates the factors influencing biogas production. These factors are integrated into different sections of the production module, such as the "biomass" block, which includes variables like maize biomass and grass biomass. The biogas output is treated as a variable with a normal distribution, defined by a mean value and standard deviation. Risk-related variables, as identified by experts, are linked to the production block and address the risks that could potentially impact these variables.
