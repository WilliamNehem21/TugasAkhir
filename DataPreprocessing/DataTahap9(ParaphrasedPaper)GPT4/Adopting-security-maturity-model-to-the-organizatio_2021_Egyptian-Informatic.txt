This paper discusses the selection and training of security personnel, along with the importance of security awareness, by detailing the fourth check of operational management processes that cover 25 essential operations including inventory and environment patching.

The paper is structured as follows: an examination of current security maturity models and related literature is in Section 2, an introduction to the proposed security maturity model is in Section 3, Section 4 applies this model to the Retirement Department and the Public Telecommunication Corporation in Yemen, Section 5 compares the proposed model with existing ones, and Section 6 offers conclusions and future work directions.

The paper highlights the variety among organizations in achieving high information security (IS) maturity by addressing specific focus areas and capabilities. It critiques previous studies for neglecting risk appraisal in digital security and only concentrating on data security in terms of confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA). A study on Malaysian public sector information security maturity is compared across three main models: SSE-CMM, COBIT, and ISM3, to elucidate their interrelations and evaluate technical factors.

COBIT 2019â€™s framework describes process capability levels ranging from 0 to 5 to measure implementation and performance, with a focus on tracking organization processes across five different levels. Another approach to maturity assessment emphasizes master data through a maturity matrix with 13 areas and 65 capabilities, although this overlooks general security maturity within organizations.

Security frameworks such as NIST and ISO (27001, 27002) perform security controls. ISM3 determines organizational levels based on daily operational controls, ranging from nonexistent to optimized. Cybersecurity auditors classify organizations based on their security maturity model to conduct audits.

Section 4 of the paper examines how to assess security levels in two types of organizations, using categories including general, operational, tactical, and strategic security maturity. The paper analyzes the security level at a Yemeni retirement organization and a public telecommunication corporation (PTC), detailing their security controls and maturity.

The retirement organization lacks regular security controls and does not adhere to any standard framework, exposing it to potential internal threats. Improvements are urgently needed to manage resources better and minimize security incident risks.

Meanwhile, PTC proves to be at a defined level of security maturity with automated processes, complying with ISO 27001 standards in payment card industries. Despite this, the company must still ensure that its protection of physical and technical information aligns with prevailing standards.
