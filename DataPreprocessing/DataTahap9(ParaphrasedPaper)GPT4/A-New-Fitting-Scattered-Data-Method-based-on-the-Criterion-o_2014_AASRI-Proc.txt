This paper highlights the limitations of traditional data fitting methods that employ the least squares criterion, especially when dealing with vector data where the independent variable is random. To address this issue, the authors propose a new fitting criterion based on minimizing the quadratic sum of geometric distances, which lays the foundation for an innovative method to fit scattered data. The paper also introduces an optimization algorithm to determine the best fitting parameters within this new framework.

Extensive prior research has explored various enhancements to the least squares method, such as principal component regression (PCR), partial least squares (PLS), their non-linear versions, neural network approaches, and hybrid techniques. However, the approach taken in this paper deviates from these traditional methods. The authors transform the model fitting process into a constrained optimization problem and offer an algorithm to solve for the fitting parameters.

Through simulation experiments, the paper validates the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The results showcase that the new fitting method outperforms the least square method in terms of precision for vector data with a random independent variable.
