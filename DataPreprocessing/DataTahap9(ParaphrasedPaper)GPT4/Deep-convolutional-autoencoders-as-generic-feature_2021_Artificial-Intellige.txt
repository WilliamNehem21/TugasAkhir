The referenced papers (Et al., 2020; Graham et al., 2020; Park et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020a) discuss the development of deep learning models geared towards extracting key features from seismic waveforms that can differentiate between the P phase, S phase, and noise. These models are trained on a vast dataset of seismic waveforms and are designed to accurately identify the arrivals of P and S waves. They have demonstrated the ability to generalize effectively to new, unseen seismic data. Similarly, Linville et al. (2019) investigated the use of convolutional and recurrent neural networks for identifying whether seismic events originate from explosions or tectonic movements at local distances. They found that their models can categorize the source type of seismic events with greater than 99% accuracy.

Autoencoders are a type of machine learning model that specializes in learning compressed representations of data, which can then be used to reconstruct the original data. These models find applications in a variety of fields, including compression, denoising, dimensionality reduction, and feature extraction. Specifically, autoencoders have shown great potential for feature extraction tasks. In the field of seismology, autoencoders are utilized to create compact feature representations that effectively reduce the dimensionality of input data, typically compressing it to about one-third of the original size. This form of autoencoder is known as an undercomplete autoencoder, characterized by a bottleneck layer that has fewer dimensions than the input layer. By compressing the data, the model is forced to capture the most salient features from the training dataset. There is also the concept of overcomplete autoencoders, which actually expand the bottleneck layer to have more dimensions than the input. In the mentioned case, an autoencoder with an input size of 1620 dimensions would have a larger encoded layer.
