Driven by the prevalent existence of event logs in various business information systems like workflow management (WFM), enterprise resource planning (ERP), customer relationship management (CRM), supply chain management (SCM), and business-to-business (B2B) platforms, process mining has emerged as a dynamic field of study. Historically, not much attention was paid to exploiting these event logs to dissect and understand the processes they represent. Process mining seeks to remedy this by extracting and examining the various dimensions of business processes—ranging from their control and data flow to the organizational and social relationships—directly from the data contained within event logs. Essentially, process mining's goal is to unlock insights from these logs to gain a better understanding of business operations.

Most of the research in process mining to date has been aimed at discovering new processes or enhancing existing ones. This paper, however, particularly addresses how process mining can be applied to security concerns.

Process mining is an established concept with a primary focus on the control-flow aspect of processes, but its applications extend beyond this. For instance, process mining techniques have been employed to map out social networks within businesses. Interested readers seeking expansive knowledge on process mining may refer to a dedicated issue of the journal Computers in Industry or a comprehensive survey paper. Nonetheless, due to space constraints, it is impossible for this paper to thoroughly cover all research contributions in this field.
