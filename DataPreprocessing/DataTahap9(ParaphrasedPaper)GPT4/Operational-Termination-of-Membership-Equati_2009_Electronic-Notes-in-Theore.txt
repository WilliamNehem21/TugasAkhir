To highlight the complexities of developing automated proofs for the termination of advanced rewrite-based programs that include features (i)-(iv), we employ Maude programs as examples. This approach helps users become accustomed to the enriched syntax that eases the transition from object systems to membership equational logic. We reference specific conditional membership rules and definitions provided in a cited work.

An illustrative case of an endlessly running program is presented where the non-termination is not due to rewriting rules. In this scenario, a conditionally defined membership rule stipulates that terms s(n) (where n is a natural number) belong to a sort 'inf', assuming s(s(n)) is also of sort 'inf'. This leads to an infinite proof tree, even though no actual rewrite has occurred.

Proposition 7.1 points out the value of employing specific results regarding the termination of many-sorted term rewrite systems (MS-TRSS) for our aims. Termination for MS-TRSS was initially studied by Zantema as a secondary technique for termination proofs in unsorted rewriting systems, although a comprehensive method for proving MS-TRSS termination was not provided. Zantema identified 'persistency'—a computational property of MS-TRSS that remains unchanged when sort information is removed—as critical, noting that termination is indeed a persistent property in single-sorted MS-TRSS. Contrarily, termination is not generally persistent across all MS-TRSS; however, Zantema offered conditions under which termination persistency does hold, such as in MS-TRSS devoid of both duplicating and collapsing rules. Furthermore, Aoto resolved a conjecture made by Zantema, demonstrating that termination is persistent in MS-TRSS with variables of a single sort.

The concept of 'persistence' is intriguing for our research—it aids in identifying subsets of one-sorted term rewrite systems (OS-TRSS) where termination is retained. This helps simplify the termination proof process, as we can disregard sort information when no sort hierarchy is established in an unconditional simply conditional many-sorted rewrite theory (SCS-MRT), effectively starting with a many-sorted TRS. Utilizing these findings allows us to streamline the proof for termination.
