Boolean networks are a widely considered qualitative method for modeling regulatory systems, comprising a set of entities with binary states, indicating active or inactive conditions, such as gene expression or protein presence. These networks have shown promise in representing gene regulatory networks (GRNs), but traditional applications face limitations. Synchronous Boolean networks, though easier to analyze due to their deterministic nature, are criticized for their biological inaccuracy. On the other hand, asynchronous networks, which offer a more realistic approach, suffer from excessive non-deterministic behaviors, many of which are not biologically plausible.

In reality, many decisions within asynchronous networks are governed by environmental pacing or the relative speeds of biochemical reactions, suggesting that actual behavior contains less indeterminacy than the models predict. This may explain why the deterministic synchronous models were originally preferred, despite their unrealistic assumption of simultaneous updates.

A key insight is that the self-sustainability (SI) of a circuit largely depends on its environment, meaning a circuit's SI status cannot be simply inferred from its structure alone, indicating that conventional asynchronous Boolean networks lack vital information about environmental interactions.

The paper advocates for the use of signal transition graphs (STGs), a type of Petri net, to better capture the interplay between a system and its environment. STGs define the permissible behavior for both inputs and outputs of a system in relation to its surroundings, essentially outlining a "contract" between the system and its environment.

The relationship between asynchronous Boolean networks and STGs is explored, demonstrating that networks can be converted into STGs, which are then refined into SI models using semi-automated methods. An STG visualizes possible signal transitions and ensures that no two different states share the same signal values, a property known as universal state coding (USC). Further transformation maintains USC and, by extension, complete state coding (CSC), ensuring that all states remain unique throughout refinement, provided the initial STG originates from a circuit model.

Deadlock-free models of STGs are guaranteed from circuit-based construction, assuming the presence of at least one input, as inputs can freely oscillate without causing the system to halt. The modification process also preserves deadlock-freeness by not disabling all enabled transitions.

Integrating STGs allows for improved automated analysis of GRNs, such as model checking. This novel approach adapts Petri net-based STGs with asynchronous circuit techniques to enhance formal modeling of biological systems.
