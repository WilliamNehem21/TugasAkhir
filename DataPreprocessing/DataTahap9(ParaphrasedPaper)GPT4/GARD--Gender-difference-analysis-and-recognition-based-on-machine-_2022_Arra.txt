This paper explores the use of big data for intelligent medical diagnosis and proposes methods to differentiate medical attributes between males and females across various age groups. The authors conduct an analysis to find common important attributes (CIAs) which can be used for gender recognition, particularly within specific age ranges. Following this, two gender recognition models (GRMs) are introduced to identify gender: One for cases with known age (GRM A) and another for unknown age (GRM B). 

The GRMs are evaluated through experiments, revealing that certain medical attributes significantly contribute to gender identification, achieving high accuracy rates of 92.8% and 93.8% for GRM A and GRM B, respectively, in the age group of 17 to 51 years using just six medical attributes.

Additionally, the paper details methods for handling missing data in electronic medical records (EMRs) with a focus on oncology, using tools like neighbors, iterative imputing, and Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE). Furthermore, a time series medical Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is developed for a wound prognosis model that can simulate continuous and categorical features from EMR data.

The paper is structured into six sections: Following the introduction, Section 2 presents the dataset and analysis of gender differences in medical examinations. Section 3 conducts cluster analysis to determine key medical examination items for gender recognition. Section 4 proposes the two GRMs based on the presence or absence of age information. Section 5 focuses on model evaluation and the impact of data analysis on gender classification. The paper concludes its findings in Section 6.

The authors conclude that age plays a critical role in the accuracy of gender recognition and that dividing the dataset into age ranges increases gender recognition accuracy. The evaluation reveals that different learning algorithms exhibit varying effectiveness, with linear regression (LR), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), Naive Bayes (NB), random forest (RF), and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) being used. Overall, the study demonstrates the potential for developing precise gender recognition models using a limited number of carefully selected medical attributes.
