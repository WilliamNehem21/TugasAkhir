In this paper, we examine the computational aspects of the Riesz Representation Theorem, particularly in the context of locally compact Hausdorff spaces. To conduct our study, we adopt the Type Two Effectivity (TTE) framework, which has proven to be a particularly effective and adaptable method for exploring issues of computability within analysis and other related disciplines.
