This study investigates the detailed structural composition of cell nuclei throughout various stages of both neural differentiation and degeneration in the olfactory neuroepithelium of P. lanceolatus, an adult species. The aim is to understand the relationship between the microscopic features of developing and deteriorating nerve cells.
