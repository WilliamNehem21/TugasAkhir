The Radon transform is a mathematical technique that calculates the integral of a function along straight lines passing through a subject. This technique is often used in imaging applications, such as X-rays, where it helps reconstruct an object's shape based on a collection of sampled projections. The continuous Radon transform can be inverted to recreate the appearance of an object, provided a representative set of projections is available.

In contrast, the discrete Radon transform (DRT) deals with objects situated within a discrete space. It translates a digital image into a series of numerical projections, defined by translations and angles in a digital grid. Beylkin expanded on this concept, providing a precise algebraic framework for the projection and inversion process. This framework connects the DRT with the discrete Fourier transform, showing they are both reversible processes. Additionally, Beylkin's work accommodates projections taken along both straight and curved paths, beneficial for fields like seismic and ultrasound imaging where wave refraction is significant.

Beylkin's work also lays the groundwork for performing spatial operations such as filtering in two-dimensional or higher spaces by working within the DRT domain. The DRT is closely related to other image processing techniques like the Hough transform, which detects lines or shapes in digital images.

An example of the DRT's application is in imaging systems with array sizes that are prime numbers, a method that is used to project the pixels of digital images. However, when considering atomic structures, the interpretation of each array location can vary. It may represent a physical property, like local electron density, denote the type of atom at that position, or simply indicate whether a lattice site is filled or vacant.

In transformation terms, the relationship between the original object, the digital image, and its projections is not one-to-one. While it is theoretically possible to accurately match a set of digital projections to their corresponding Radon projections, transforming back to the digital or original image is a lossy process influenced by the specifics of the transition from continuous to discrete spaces.

Lastly, Beylkin's framework involves numerical patterns derived from the underlying mathematics, an example of which would be the periodicity observed when calculating contributions to specific values in the transform. Different prime factors can lead to a combined periodic effect for certain calculations, such as determining the frequency of a particular structure in the DRT.
