The paper discusses an editor with a new state parameter: the number of characters that have been read. The editor reads characters one by one. For regular characters, it behaves as it did previously. However, if the backspace character is encountered and there's at least one character present, the editor deletes the last character. If no characters are present, the editor emits a beep signal.

Previously, the programs discussed could only terminate when the response function r(s, c) returned empty for some state s and character c, which could result in the program becoming unresponsive, effectively freezing it. To address this, the paper proposes a mechanism that allows programs to terminate properly while returning a specific value. This value, drawn from a set A(s) associated with the state s, represents the result of the function computed by the program. This addition is intended to enable the programs to conclude their execution more gracefully and to provide an output value upon completion.
