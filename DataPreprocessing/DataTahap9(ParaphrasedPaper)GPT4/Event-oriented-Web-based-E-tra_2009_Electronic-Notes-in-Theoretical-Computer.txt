This academic paper's structure is outlined as follows: Section 2 details foundational concepts. Section 3 provides an in-depth overview of e-cooperatives and introduces the conceptual ewe model. In Section 4, the logical axioms forming the ewe model are presented. Section 5 discusses domain-specific, non-logical axioms and their relevance to crafting ewe policies. Section 6 covers the practical implementation of the proposed method. Section 7 examines literature relevant to the topic. Finally, Section 8 concludes the paper, reflecting on the findings and suggesting directions for future research.

When acting on behalf of a client, a server agent must choose between independent (f-mode) or collaborative (c-mode) action, with differing intentions based on the mode. For instance, an agent may allow a smaller minimum purchase value individually than when operating cooperatively.

Server agents must adhere to a principle ensuring maximum individual satisfaction within a shared ethos, with other ethos types available for different group dynamics, all representable in the proposed framework.

Events are a central concept in the ewe model, providing a uniform way to express changes, crucial in both linguistics and knowledge representation. Events are considered momentary occurrences, and the paper approaches time as a one-dimensional, linear, and discrete sequence, akin to the natural numbers, starting from a point and having no definitive end.

The paper also discusses how ewe policies might require real-time considerations, for which they employ the auxiliary predicate "current_time/1" to align with system clock times. The "current_time" function determines the truth value based on whether the time 't' matches the actual current time, defined as 'now'.

Lastly, the concept of "permission/3" elucidates that a client 'c' can undertake action 'a' on resource 'r' if 'c' has the designated status 'l', defined by the "sla/2" (status level assignment), and if either a single server agent in f-mode or a group of server agents in c-mode confer that clients with status 'l' are allowed to perform action 'a' on 'r'.
