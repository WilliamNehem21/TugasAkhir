Symbolic Regression (SR) is a method that identifies mathematical formulas capable of explaining a given set of training data. SR creates expressions using various arithmetic operations or mathematical functions in combination with variables and numerical constants. These expressions are not limited to a predefined structure, unlike predefined feature combinations used in methods like multiple linear regression (MLR). This flexibility allows SR to discover non-linear relationships in the form of clear, explicit formulas without having to guess the underlying model beforehand. The challenge with SR is that the potential range of mathematical expressions is extremely large, making the search for the correct formula complex.

Within the text, a specific expression is described that integrates two arc cosine and two arc tangent functions along with multiple occurrences of the 'number of aliphatic heterocycles' (Nalihc) variable. Despite the simplicity of the expression, its complexity renders visual interpretation difficult and it does not successfully explain the training data. Conversely, a more complex expression with an R-squared value of 0.98 indicates a successful fit with the training dataset, demonstrating the ability of SR to generate models with high predictive accuracy.
