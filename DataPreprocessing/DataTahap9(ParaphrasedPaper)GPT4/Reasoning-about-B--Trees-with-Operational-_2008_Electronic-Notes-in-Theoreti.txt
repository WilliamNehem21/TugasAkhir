Title: Formalization and Verification of B+ Tree Operations

In this paper, we systematically define the structure of B+ trees within the framework of separation logic. Section 2 presents the data structure invariant for the B+ trees. Section 3 introduces the procedures and semantics for inserting elements into the B+ tree and demonstrates their correct functioning. Section 4 examines the process for searching for elements within a specified range. Deletion operations and their complexities are explored in Section 5. The paper concludes with Section 6, where the implications and conclusions drawn from our research are addressed, along with an overview of future extensions and areas of investigation.

B+ trees are characterized as balanced, n-ary search trees with ordered elements and allow for modifications that can affect the tree's structure. These modifications must conform to the maintained B+ tree invariant, potentially prompting adjustments to the upper levels of the tree for structural maintenance. Data is exclusively held in leaf nodes, and all nodes, apart from the root, are required to be at least half-filled. Additionally, leaf nodes form a singly-linked list for efficient sequential access.

Constraints on node occupancy are enforced by the predicate notations, where 'btree' ensures nodes do not exceed their maximum capacity and 'btreeh+1' safeguards a minimum fill-level of at least half the maximum capacity for each child node. The typical expectation that all nodes, excluding the root, maintain a minimum half capacity stems from a straightforward inductive argument.

Operation semantics is segmented into four parts. The first offers a singular rule for selecting the correct path down internal nodes while keeping track of the path in a stack. The second part delineates three potential outcomes encountered at leaf nodes: (i) direct replacement of an existing entry without additional actions, (ii) simple entry fit and update within a single page, and (iii) a split due to the absence of enough space, resulting in the creation and insertion of a new leaf node and a consequential parent-level adjustment.

The third part delves into the knock-on effect of insertions moving up the tree. Three scenarios are depicted: (i) a seamless fit at the current level allowing for passive upward progress, (ii) a suitable insertion at the current level following a leaf split, and (iii) a necessary split at the current level owing to insufficient space for the new entry, indicating modifications at an even higher level.

Overall, this paper endeavors to solidify the understanding of B+ tree operations using formal methods, laying a foundation for their reliable implementation and verification. Our insights emphasize the importance of rigorous invariant preservation during operations and set the stage for continued exploration into the optimization and potential enhancements of B+ tree structures.
