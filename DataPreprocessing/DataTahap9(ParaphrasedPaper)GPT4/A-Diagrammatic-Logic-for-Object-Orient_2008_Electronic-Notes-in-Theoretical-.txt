The academic paper discusses the concept of formal generalized sketches, a graph-based method for specifying software systems that combines ideas from categorical logic and ordinary first-order logic to suit software engineering requirements. It emphasizes creating a modeling language with both mathematical precision and visual appeal. The paper provides a rationale for using generalized sketches in formal modeling languages and explains how these sketches are naturally suited to software modeling. Furthermore, it explores the addition of dependencies between predicate symbols and proposes new semantic perspectives that view instances as typed structures. It demonstrates how this approach aligns with institutional theory and is conducive to algebraic processes.

The authors also touch upon how humans prefer visual representations, like diagrams, for understanding and designing software systems. These visual models, however, often lack clear semantics, leaving their meaning vague. To address this, the paper aims to use the pattern of dp-logic to provide a formal structure to these visual notations.

The paper details its content as follows: Section 2 lays out the rationale for the machinery defined within the paper, including the use of classical and generalized sketches, the introduction of predicate dependencies, and the preference for instances-as-typed-structures (IATS) semantics over indexed semantics. Section 3 provides examples of modeling with sketches and discusses the specification of model systems within the institutional framework.

The authors envision that this paper serves as a foundation for future research in two primary areas. One is to adapt the sketch formalism to formally define modeling languages commonly used in software engineering and adhere to industry standards, particularly with respect to behavior modeling. The second is to investigate the practical applicability of sketches in solving real-world software engineering problems.
