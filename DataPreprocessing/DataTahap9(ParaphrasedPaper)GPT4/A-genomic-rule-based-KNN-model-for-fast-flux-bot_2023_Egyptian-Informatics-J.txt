A botnet refers to a coordinated network of compromised computers, termed zombies, which are infected with malware, known as bots, that are remotely controlled by an operator commonly called a botmaster. The growth of the internet has resulted in widespread networks of these vulnerable computers. Consequently, internet utilization involves inherent security risks, with botnets being a significant security concern.

As cybercriminals continually refine their tactics for financial gain, the concept of botnets has evolved into a sophisticated infrastructure of remotely operated networks of infected hosts. These botnets are directed by a central command-and-control (C&C) server, from which the botmaster exercises control. To evade detection, botmasters often use fast-flux service networks (FFSN) to frequently change their C&C infrastructure.

Detection of such fast-flux activity generally falls under traditional machine learning tasks, where features of network traffic are analyzed by classifiers. However, the dynamic nature of botnets requires that researchers either develop new features or adapt reliable existing features from the literature. Despite various botnet detection systems (BDS) being proposed, effectively combining dependable features for accurate detection is challenging due to the elusive characteristics of current feature sets and the botmasters' ongoing efforts to mimic legitimate internet traffic.

Honeynets, networks of decoy servers known as honeypots, are intentionally vulnerable systems designed to attract attackers to study their behavior and signature patterns. While honeynets are powerful in understanding botnet strategies, they do not always succeed in catching the botnet-inflicted damage. Based on the level of interaction they allow, honeypots can be categorized into low-interaction and high-interaction systems, with each offering varying levels of access to the system.

Researchers have proposed various methods for botnet detection, including employing normal traffic patterns, developing hybrid models using SVM classifiers, DNS rule-based methods to detect irregular activity, and data mining approaches for identifying command-and-control traffic. For instance, techniques for filtering network features and analyzing anomalies have shown promising results.

Some studies suggest heuristic methods for detecting DNS queries from botmasters trying to determine if their bots are on blacklists. There are also methods like K-nearest neighbor (K-NN), a simple machine learning approach, which classifies data based on predefined neighbors and does not need training phases typical of other methods.

Other important approaches for detection include employing decision trees like C4.5, genetic algorithms, and support vector machines (SVM). Performance evaluations of these algorithms focus on metrics like false positive and negative rates, as well as overall accuracy.

An experimental botnet detection system, referred to in the paper as bot-ffx, demonstrated high overall accuracy and significantly reduced false alarm rates by distinguishing effectively between malicious botnet domains and benign ones, showcasing a valuable contribution to the field of botnet detection.
