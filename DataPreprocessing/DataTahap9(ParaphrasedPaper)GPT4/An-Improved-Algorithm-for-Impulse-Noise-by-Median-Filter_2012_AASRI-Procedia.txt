The paper introduces an advanced algorithm designed to enhance impulse noise removal in image processing by optimizing the median filter. This algorithm uses principles of indiscernibility from rough sets theory to identify isolated noise points within an image, thus improving the detection of individual noisy pixels. The proposed improvements include a sophisticated method for selecting thresholds and filter templates for median filtering. Simulation experiments indicate that this new approach outperforms traditional methods by significantly reducing image degradation and increasing image clarity.

The paper emphasizes the importance of choosing the correct threshold and filter templates in median filtering for effective impulse noise identification and removal. By incorporating the concept of indiscernibility from rough sets, the paper suggests a novel method for detecting isolated noise points. The new median filter aims to preserve image edges better than conventional median filters while improving the signal-to-noise ratio, which previous techniques have compromised. Experimental examples are provided to support the proposed method's effectiveness in image processing applications targeting impulse noise.
