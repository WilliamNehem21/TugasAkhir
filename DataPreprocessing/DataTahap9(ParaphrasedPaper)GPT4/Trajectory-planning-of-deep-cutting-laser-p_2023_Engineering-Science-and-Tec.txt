The academic paper deals with the challenges associated with low profiling efficiency in laser dressing technology for profile grinding wheels and proposes a new approach to address these challenges. Here is a paraphrased version of the paper's content:

Industrial application of laser dressing for profile grinding wheels is hindered by low efficiency. The paper presents a novel deep-cutting laser profiling trajectory planning method, establishes a theoretical model for Gaussian laser beam energy distribution on the wheel surface, and systematically examines its impact on profiling efficiency for superabrasive grinding wheels. Experiments confirmed that this method notably enhances efficiency for V-shaped wheels and that efficiency gains are greater for smaller tip angles. Grain size changes affect the removal method and thus profiling efficiency, but have little impact on accuracy. This trajectory planning method can achieve the small V-tip arc radius of diamonds unreachable by mechanical or electrical dressing. It also substantially enhances efficiency for convex/concave arc-shaped wheels, with improvement related to arc radius or chord-to-diameter ratio. Despite identical sizes, such wheels show different efficiencies, suggesting the need for tailored laser profiling strategies based on size or ratio for balance between efficiency, accuracy, and quality.

Addressing the need for better dressing methods for superabrasive grinding wheels beyond mechanical and electrical approaches with limitations like rapid tool wear and difficulty dressing concave surfaces, the paper explores a laser-based solution. It outlines the need for scientific trajectory planning in deep-cutting laser profiling to avoid inefficiencies caused by an idling laser beam during scanning. Determining material removal thresholds for trajectory planning is crucial, and the paper suggests using laser ablation experiments or observing plasma emission spectra during dressing to identify these thresholds. Targeting specific characteristic wavelength ranges can help avoid interference from bond material when measuring spectral lines corresponding to wheel material elements.

The paper includes an experiment with a 70 W laser to demonstrate the method's efficiency, showing a 20% increase in profiling efficiency and time-saving. Variations in laser power density across different wheel profiles require different numbers of planned trajectories. The research received financial support from various Chinese scientific foundations and programs.

In summary, this study introduces a new laser profiling approach with a more efficient trajectory planning method for dressing profile grinding wheels and examines factors influencing profiling efficiency and accuracy. It recommends customizing the laser dressing process based on the size and design of the grinding wheel to optimize results.
