The Shape Calculus is an innovative calculus that draws inspiration from biology to describe the movements of three-dimensional geometrical shapes within a space. These shapes, when endowed with behavior, form 3D processes - individual, interactive entities capable of forming bonds with other compatible entities and breaking apart from these bonds as needed. Due to the inherent complexity of geometry within a space, time-sensitive behaviors, the diverse motion laws, and an element of non-determinism, 3D processes often display behaviors that are infinite and beyond simple deterministic interpretation. This complexity hinders definitive analytic approaches. Up to now, Shape Calculus models have primarily been reserved for simulation, serving as a platform for the validation of models and for testing hypotheses.

In this paper, we propose using the Shape Calculus in a new and complementary way, especially for systems biology. We introduce the concept of an abstract interpretation that can be used to verify certain properties of a model that do not account for time or space constraints (referred to as untimed and unspatial safety properties). This abstraction emphasizes the possible interactions and outcomes between processes that, as the system evolves, may combine to generate new composite processes or species. The paper also contemplates alternative abstract domains for verifying an extended range of properties.

The Shape Calculus, a sophisticated language, is mainly used for depicting biological phenomena. It's a spatial, shape-oriented language where entities have 3D geometrical configurations that interact dynamically in a virtual 3D environment. Each 3D process adheres to unique movement rules, and they can bind upon collision to form new, complex 3D processes, which leads to a network of interacting processes with unending behaviors. While the expressive power of the calculus is extensive and naturally encompasses attributes typical of biological models, this complexity and the infiniteness of behaviors make existing analysis techniques, suitable for simpler systems, inapplicable. The Bioshape environment, built upon the Shape Calculus, allows for the definition, simulation, and validation of models, as well as hypothesis testing and scale-uniform simulations.

For example, the hexokinase process interacts by binding to metabolites. When it has bound to the necessary components and time delays have elapsed, a strong-split action causes a reaction and product formation. Another example focuses on the possibility of interaction between a glucose and an ATP molecule. After abstracting from spatial and velocity considerations, all instances of a particular 3D process converge into a single abstract entity, forming sets of these abstract processes as elements within the abstract domain.

In a concrete domain, a particular combination of processes would be unable to complete a reaction because of inherent delays. However, in the abstract domain, this issue is circumvented, and reactions can occur, leading to a fixed point where no further transitions are possible. Therefore, one can deduce that individual glucose and ATP processes can't directly interact with each other in the defined context.
