Geophysical log interpretation involves utilizing borehole data such as lithofacies and porosity to gain insights about subsurface geological structures. Recent advancements in machine learning have significantly improved the interpretation of this data. A notable example is the introduction of a semi-supervised machine learning model known as the Laplacian Support Vector Machine, which addresses the issue of limited labeled data by leveraging the inherent smoothness of geological features and their continuity along the borehole depth. This approach allows the model to extend the insights gleaned from labeled examples to unlabeled ones, enhancing classification accuracy. However, the configuration of the Laplacian can be somewhat arbitrary, and incorporating unlabeled data might sometimes degrade performance when compared to using only labeled data. To counter this, an ensemble method is applied to determine an optimal Laplacian setting, ensuring that the semi-supervised method benefits from the inclusion of unlabeled data. More examples of similar research are available in the literature.

Additionally, data mining and processing techniques are integrated with machine learning to tackle challenges such as data imbalances. While filtering techniques can remove some random, non-stratigraphic noise, they are limited in addressing the broader distribution issues within the data.
