Modular exponentiation is a key operation in many cryptographic systems. There are two main methods for computing modular exponentiation: the most significant bit (MSB) first approach and the least significant bit (LSB) first approach. The LSB-first approach has the advantage of concurrent execution of modular multiplication and squaring operations, potentially reducing computation time. Research has explored ways to merge multiplication and squaring into a single, more efficient structure, with the aim of enhancing performance and hardware efficiency.

This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of the combined polynomial multiplication-squaring algorithm within the finite field GF(2^m). Section 3 presents the dependency graph associated with this algorithm. Section 4 describes a proposed two-dimensional, word-based, single instruction, single data (SISO) systolic processor design. Section 5 compares the area and delay complexities of the new design to the best existing word-serial multiplier designs. The paper concludes in Section 6 with a summary of the findings.

In this system, outputs CW and CE influence only the southern output CS. At a certain time (time step n), while output CW is valid, output CS has not yet accounted for addition from CE. This means an additional time step is required for iterations to produce the final combined multiplication/squaring result.

The new design's area and timing complexities are benchmarked against those of previous word-serial multiplier structures. Area is assessed based on the number of required tri-state buffers, 2-input AND gates, 2-input XOR gates, 2-input multiplexers, and flip-flops. Timing is evaluated by considering both latency and critical path delay (CPD).
