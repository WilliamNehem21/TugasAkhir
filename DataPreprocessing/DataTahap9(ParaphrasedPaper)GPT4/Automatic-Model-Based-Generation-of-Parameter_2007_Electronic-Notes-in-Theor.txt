The paper describes methods for generating test cases for verifying if an implementation under test (IUT) adheres to its specifications, known as conformance testing. Two primary approaches are discussed: using a separate model for the test suite, which may lead to duplicated modeling efforts, and generating test cases by analyzing existing models of the IUT.

The authors apply data abstraction to model open systems, thereby turning an open system with potentially infinite state space into a finite abstract system. This abstract system is then used to generate test cases directed by a test purpose, which defines the scenario being tested. These test cases, however, use abstract data that must be concretized before test execution.

Concretization involves using constraint-solving techniques alongside transforming the original specification into a rule system that assists in selecting appropriate test data. As tests are executed, the IUT's behavior is monitored, and any deviation from the expected behavior is corrected through dynamic online constraint-solving to keep the test on track.

The paper provides a detailed structure, starting with the theoretical foundations of conformance testing, defining syntax and semantics for specification methods, and delving into constraint-solving preliminaries. A case study is presented to demonstrate the approach, and the paper concludes with a summary and indication of proofs for various lemmas discussed within.

The authors acknowledge related works in symbolic test generation, which also rely on high-level specification without state enumeration, based on the ioco (input/output conformance) theory. The approach in this paper is likened to others that use rules for generating constraints to determine test data, albeit with the difference that in this paper, test cases already exist and the rule system is merely for finding concrete data.

The approach assumes general environments for the IUT, leading to abstract models that are safe approximations of an infinite state space, making it feasible for model checking. Abstraction includes transforming expressions to new 'safe' types, ensuring that the abstract system simulates the original system's behaviors while substituting environmental influences with abstract representations.

Test execution is detailed, including how trace analysis works, nondeterminism handling in the IUT, and verdict assignment for test executions. In conclusion, the authors mention the potential for their approach to be adapted for test case generation from Unified Modeling Language (UML) specifications, expressing interest in targeting TTCN-3 (Testing and Test Control Notation version 3) as the output language, which has significant industrial acceptance.
