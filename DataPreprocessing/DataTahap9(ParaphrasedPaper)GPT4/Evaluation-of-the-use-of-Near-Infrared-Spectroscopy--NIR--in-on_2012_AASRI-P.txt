Developing tools for real-time monitoring and diagnostics is crucial for extending the lifespan of power transformers. Dissolved gas analysis in insulating oil is highly informative for assessing transformer health and is integral to preventative maintenance. The condition of the oil directly impacts transformer performance and longevity, and on-line monitoring has proven to be an effective method for ensuring safe operation. This paper details a method for on-line analysis of gases produced by operating electrical transformers, which is significant for fault detection and tracking the chemical degradation of mineral insulation oil. The method involves near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR) conducted by a new prototype that integrates with the Buchholz relay, using NIR spectroscopy and chemometric tools to yield insights from the samples. Advances in chemometrics software and computing have enhanced the practicality of NIR for process analysis.

Fault gas analysis is acknowledged as a valuable resource for diagnosing deteriorating transformer oil and paper insulation, as faults accelerate deterioration and vary the types of gases produced. Early fault detection and near real-time condition data are crucial; hence, on-line monitoring of exhaust gases is a dependable method for safeguarding transformer operation. On-line monitoring, including dissolved gas in oil and free gas from the Buchholz relay, assists in diagnosing and identifying nascent faults. Excessive gases, exceeding oil saturation, can be captured by the Buchholz relay, signifying a reduction in the oilâ€™s insulating capacity that might lead to further issues.

This study explores using NIR spectroscopy and chemometric techniques to analyze light hydrocarbon gases (methane, ethane, ethylene, and acetylene) linked with insulation system faults. A spectrophotometer prototype with a measuring cell was developed for this purpose, focusing on gas monitoring within the Buchholz relay. Details about calibration procedures, measurement constraints, and error analysis are presented.

The paper emphasizes the suitability of NIR combined with chemometrics for monitoring gases indicative of oil decomposition in transformers. Synthetic gas mixtures were created and measured, and calibration was conducted with various gaseous mixtures. A software package, the Unscrambler 9.2, was used to build chemometric models, with a gas chromatograph serving as the reference method for gas concentration verification.

The study's findings demonstrate that NIR with chemometrics is a promising tool for monitoring gas species from insulating oil decomposition. The resulting calibration model, based on multivariate regression and partial least squares, displayed satisfactory accuracy for different hydrocarbons within real sample ranges. Additionally, newer measurement cell designs based on multiple reflections are being developed to enhance the sensitivity and reduce the detection limit of hydrocarbon gases to just a few parts per million, further improving the technique's applicability for on-line monitoring of power transformers.
