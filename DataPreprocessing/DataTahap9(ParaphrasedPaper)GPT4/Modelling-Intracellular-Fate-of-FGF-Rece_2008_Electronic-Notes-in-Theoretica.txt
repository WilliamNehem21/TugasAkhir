The paper discusses the development and analysis of a simplified model that examines how fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and its receptors (FGFRs), particularly FGFR4, are dynamically produced within a cell. Despite uncertain production rates for FGFR4 and the model's potential lack of realism, it illustrates the possibility of FGFR4 overproduction, suggesting that further sensitivity analysis is needed to explore realistic scenarios.

The paper acknowledges that the model is an abstraction, not aiming to capture all biological system details, but rather focusing on the signaling activation/deactivation and component relocation within different cell compartments. It does not attempt to precisely model the chemical reactions in the endocytotic pathway, setting its approach apart from other detailed studies.

The paper is structured as follows: a review of the BioAmbients model's syntax and semantics, and a definition of its stochastic semantics. Next, it examines the FGF endocytotic pathway and presents a model within BioAmbients. Then, the results of simulation runs are discussed, evaluating the model's predictive capacity. The paper concludes with an appendix detailing the simulated experiments and quantitative results.

The study investigates the unclear roles of separate FGFRs in signal transduction and reviews the existing literature on the intracellular trafficking of ligand-bound receptors. Experiments were conducted to measure degradation rates of the ligand and receptors, revealing two distinct intracellular pathways, which depend on which FGFR the FGF1 binds to. FGF1 that binds with FGFR1-FGFR3 typically ends up in lysosomes for degradation, while FGF1 with FGFR4 mainly goes to the recycling compartment.

It is assumed in the model that the FGF:FGFR complex remains bound in the sorting endosome, even though literature suggests that it usually dissociates in the early endosome and recycles. The model avoids directly simulating the unbinding process but models the movement of FGFR to different cellular compartments.

Future work includes updating the model to reflect recent findings that FGF:FGFR complexes that do not dissociate in the sorting endosome recycle directly back to the cell surface, and explicitly modeling biological switches that cause FGF:FGFR unbinding. The current model serves as a starting point for understanding FGFR behavior, particularly issues of overproduction that may contribute to cancer development.

Acknowledgments are made for contributions from various researchers and for valuable discussions on system biology and the topic at hand.

A method is detailed where FGF1 was labeled with a fluorescent dye, while EGF and transferrin were tagged with different dyes, to determine the compartmental destinations of the receptors based on the overlap of dye colors. The experiments ran for two hours to track the paths taken by the various receptors.
