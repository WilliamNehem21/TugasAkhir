The paper discusses extending the Curry-Howard correspondence, which traditionally maps mathematical proofs to functional computations, to a concurrent computational setting, particularly for systems with non-deterministic behavior. Traditional approaches have aligned the correspondence with deterministic processes, fitting concurrent systems into a framework where only predictable behaviors occur. However, concurrent systems typically feature non-deterministic and non-confluent process reductions, which do not naturally align with the confluent and deterministic nature of proof normalization or cut elimination in logic, effectively limiting models of concurrent processes to resemble functional behaviors.

In this work, the authors explore the interpretation of the MCCS (a fragment of the CCS, Calculus of Communicating Systems) in the context of extending the Curry-Howard correspondence to include non-deterministic concurrent systems. The paper describes a method for representing execution-relevant elements of processes in terms of locations, cuts, and XOR conditions. These elements are coded into "designs," a concept from ludics (an interactive theory of computability and complexity). Each component of the process is represented as a negative design and aggregated into a larger positive design, which serves as a preliminary interpretation of the process.

The paper further delves into a replication-free fragment of the CCS and how the non-deterministic choice operator (also known as the sum operator) in the calculus functions as a form of mutual exclusion that awaits an external choice to select a process for execution via synchronization with the channels of one of the alternative processes.

One of the key advancements presented is the use of design generators that allow for the representation of potentially infinite designs with finite means, enabling the recursive definitions necessary for the interpretation of the full calculus with replication.

The paper elaborates on the semantics of positive and negative actions within designs, detailing how names indicate polarity and the branching nature of rules. Additionally, the paper explains the conversion of non-variable elements into cuts within positive designs, offering a deeper insight into the structural representation of concurrency within the logic framework.
