Scope and Approach: This review presents a comparison of electronic noses (e-noses) and electronic tongues (e-tongues) applications for evaluating food quality. It details the operation, uses, and limitations of the sensors they rely on. The paper also discusses common data analysis techniques like Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Partial Least Squares Regression (PLS), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to process the sensory data.

The human nose is instrumental in daily life for assessing food quality and detecting potentially dangerous gases. Despite having about 400 scent receptors capable of sensing a vast array of odors, human evaluation is subjective and limited, making it an imperfect tool for comprehensive scent analysis.

Conductive polymer (CP) composites, made of conducting particles and an insulating polymer matrix, are prominent in gas sensor technology following metal oxide semiconductors. These sensors can function without added heat, leading to lower energy consumption, and their molecular structure can be easily modified, which is beneficial for sensor robustness and versatility.

PCA, a standard linear classification technique, is noteworthy for its ability to reduce the dimensionality of data from e-nose sensors, which often involves numerous signals from a large array of sensors.

ANNs have historically been used in various food quality assessments with newer methods, and combinations now enhancing this approach. Data simplification with PCA before using ANNs has been a notable advancement. Other neural network variations have been employed, such as Probabilistic Neural Networks (PNNs) and General Regression Neural Networks (GRNNs).

CNNs, often used in image recognition, have a layered structure that includes convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers for processing image-based data.

Decision trees are another method where a hierarchical tree structure, utilizing branching based on specific decision functions at each node, classifies input data. The ID3 algorithm is a common training approach for constructing decision trees using a top-down, greedy method, focusing on the most informative attribute for decision-making.

Human taste panels have been traditional methods for evaluating food flavors, but they can be biased and costly. E-tongues offer a faster, more objective, and cost-efficient alternative, using various chemical sensors to detect taste-related compounds.

E-tongues employing potentiometric, voltammetric, and impedimetric sensor technologies have demonstrated effectiveness in classifying food products, matching and in some cases surpassing conventional analytical methods. Sweeteners and acids, critical for food flavor, can be measured with these sensors based on their chemical reaction outputs, autologous enzymatic activities, or by measuring bioelectrical signals.

Impedimetric biosensors use biomaterials like antibodies and nucleic acids to capture analytes on electrode surfaces, providing a means to detect pathogenic organisms like E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella Typhimurium in food.

Overall, the review concludes that e-noses and e-tongues hold great potential for advancing food quality evaluations, with ongoing improvements in sensor technologies and data analysis methods continually enhancing their capabilities.
