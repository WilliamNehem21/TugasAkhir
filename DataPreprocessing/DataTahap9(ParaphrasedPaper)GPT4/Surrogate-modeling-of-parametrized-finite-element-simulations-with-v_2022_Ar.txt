This academic paper deals with the development of a machine learning strategy for constructing parametric surrogate models based on the results from parametrized finite element simulations. To handle the diverse topology of finite element simulations, the first step involves the creation of a unified nodal data structure, which is achieved through re-sampling and node registration using the coherent point drift method. In the next step, a parametric surrogate model is trained with a fully-connected feed-forward neural network to predict the initial coordinates.

The paper then presents two approaches using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for predicting various field quantities. One approach is node-by-node prediction using compact LSTM models where each node's time series is predicted independently, with the initial node coordinates as input features. The other, the all-at-once approach, forecasts the time series of all nodes simultaneously using LSTM models with PCA for dimensionality reduction.

The difficulty of analyzing numerous finite element simulation results is highlighted, and the need for a fast decision-making approach is emphasized. The proposed parametrized surrogate models can facilitate quick assessments by mapping input features to responses. The paper discusses dimensionality reduction and mentions methods like PCA and structure-preserving neural networks (SPNNs).

The two predictive approaches (node-by-node and all-at-once) are compared in terms of accuracy and predictability, as well as training and evaluation time. Sections of the paper detail the load case, solution approaches for predictions, comparative analysis with finite element results, and new discoveries of response patterns using the node-by-node approach.

It's noted that the all-at-once approach does not use initial coordinates as input features and uses LSTM with Gaussian dropout for regularization. Output vector size of the LSTM cell affects the weights and biases, with 128 units recommended for the model. The all-at-once model is re-trained with comprehensive data but has limitations in generalization highlighted by the poor predictions in the pnck response.

Lastly, the benefits of the node-by-node approach over the all-at-once approach are discussed, including the discovery of a new crack pattern validated by an FE simulation. Limitations of the all-at-once approach are also noted, emphasizing the importance of local input features for generalization. The paper includes a summary of CPD, an algorithm used for aligning point clouds while preserving topology, described in more detail in the referenced literature.
