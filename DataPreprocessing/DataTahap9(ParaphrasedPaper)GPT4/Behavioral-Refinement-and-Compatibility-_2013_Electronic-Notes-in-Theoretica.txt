This academic paper discusses the notions of refinement and compatibility in the context of system models, specifically statechart diagrams. It begins by describing how these models can be iteratively developed by adding new features incrementally. The paper addresses the question of whether old behaviors are preserved when a system is extended, an aspect referred to as compatibility.

The authors review existing work on semantic refinement and propose a new approach to eliminate the effects of newly added features to preserve behavior. Their novel concept allows for the extended compatibility of newly added features, even when these features use existing input and output events, which existing concepts do not support.

The paper then goes into technical details, describing the notation and the semantic model used to observe input and output events rather than internal states. It compares refinement, a process of enriching models with details while maintaining behavior, with compatibility, the ability of the refined system to act as a substitute for the original.

The authors introduce their new concept of refinement under elimination, which enables the use of newly added features without compromising the behavior. They claim their approach is new and can cover practical examples where new features integrate with existing events.

The paper further examines related work from various research fields and contrasts their approach with existing techniques. It stresses that their results fill a gap by handling cases of extended compatibility that other methods cannot address, including how multiple usages of a new feature can still preserve compatibility.

Finally, they conclude that their main contribution is a precise method to eliminate the influence of new behavior at a trace level, allowing for more nuanced compatibility and refinement analysis, and opening up new applications not possible with previous concepts.
