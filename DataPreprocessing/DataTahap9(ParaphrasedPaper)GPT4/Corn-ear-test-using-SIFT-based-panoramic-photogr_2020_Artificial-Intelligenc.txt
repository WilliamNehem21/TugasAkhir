The study being referenced discusses a limited number of nondestructive techniques for measuring corn ears. It highlights the emerging trend of using machine vision and panoramic photography for sophisticated, high-throughput agriculture, which has been gaining attention in the field.

The research focuses on the use of the SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) algorithm, a technique that detects and describes features within images. It identifies extreme points across different scales and determines their location, scale, and orientation, rendering them invariant to these transformations. The method involves several steps including scale-space extreme detection, key point orientation assignment, feature vector generation, and feature matching.

In their experiments, the researchers analyzed ten corn ears. They observed that the number of kernels which appeared connected after segmentation influenced kernel counting accuracy due to similar grayscale values between kernels and their gaps. To address this, the team applied a grayscale transformation to the original corn ear images, enhancing the contrast and enabling better segmentation.

The study took measures to ensure that the transformation process did not affect the image backgrounds. This involved calculating the distribution probability of each grayscale level and then defining a background area based on certain threshold probabilities. This ensured that only relevant corn ear regions underwent the grayscale transformation.

The authors tested the processed images of ten corn samples from different cultivars, comparing manual and algorithm-mediated measurements of corn ear dimensions. The accuracy of the algorithm in determining kernel area and the length-width ratio was high, with 95.36% and 97.42% accuracy, respectively.
