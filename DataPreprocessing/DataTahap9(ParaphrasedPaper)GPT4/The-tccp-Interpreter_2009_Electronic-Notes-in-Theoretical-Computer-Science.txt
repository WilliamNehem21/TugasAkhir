In this study, we introduce the tccpInterpreter, a system created through the implementation of the tccp language in Maude. Maude's compatibility with prototyping programming language semantics has been previously established. The tccpInterpreter parses tccp programs and simulates their execution while leveraging Maude's features for program execution and analysis.

The tccp language, derived from ccp, is characterized by its parametric nature concerning a specific constraint system, its non-determinism, and the monotonically increasing nature of its stored information. The constraint system delineates the constraints that can be processed and their interrelationships. The non-deterministic element enables concise and exact descriptions of extensive systems, while the monotonic storage behavior necessitates the use of streams for modeling variable value changes over time.

Temporal aspects in tccp are managed by a global clock that synchronizes execution. Its agent-based structure effectively describes reactive and embedded systems. New time-related features, such as timeouts, time-delays, and watchdogs, help capture the typical behaviors of reactive systems within the language. Additionally, the incorporation of time into the language semantics allows for the use of a constrained version of linear temporal logic (LTL) for specifying and model checking tccp program properties.

To our knowledge, only one tccp implementation exists, developed in Mozart-Oz, but it is neither publicly accessible nor does it support recent tccp features.

This paper is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces tccp basics, Section 3 details the implementation of tccp syntax and operational semantics in Maude, and Section 4 presents a specific constraint system model. Section 5 uses an illustrative example to demonstrate the tool's functionality, and Section 6 concludes and suggests future research directions.

Temporal considerations are reflected as store updates and queries take one-time unit, making only the tell, choice, and procedure call agents time-consuming, whereas others are instantaneous.

A modification to the tccp model includes new agents to handle streams more compactly and effectively: ask-tell, update, and assign agents, facilitating stream manipulation and store updates.

The paper describes semantic rules governing agent evolution. tccpInterpreter, implemented in Maude, executes the tccp language operational semantics with a constraint solver. The interpreter consists of roughly 1080 lines of code across six Maude modules.

Interaction with the built-in constraint solver is critical, managing arithmetic, boolean constraints, and stream operations, elegantly realized in Maude.

tccpInterpreter is used with Maude commands, such as 'red', to parse language entities and reduce expressions according to the grammar. The paper provides examples, including a conditional agent that uses a tell agent to turn off a microwave and emit error signals based on the door status.

The tccp execution model accommodates continuous system states, managed through Maude's debugging feature or by setting time-unit limits.

The study concludes that Maude serves as a semantic framework and metalanguage for the execution environment of tccp, highlighting the advantages and practicality of using Maude for formalizing tccp behavior.
