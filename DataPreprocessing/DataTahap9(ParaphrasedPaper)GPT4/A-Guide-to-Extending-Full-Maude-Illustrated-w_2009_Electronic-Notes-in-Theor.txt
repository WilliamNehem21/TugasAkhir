The purpose of this article is to provide a practical guide for creating extensions of Maude, using the development of the Real-Time Maude tool from Full Maude as an example. Initially, the paper summarizes the functionalities and architecture of Full Maude, then it goes on to discuss the implementation details of Real-Time Maude, highlighting the incorporation of new module types, rules, commands, and the need to maintain additional state information.

Building upon the success of Maude for modeling and examining concurrent systems, the article suggests that such extensions would naturally evolve towards encompassing real-time, probabilistic, stochastic, hybrid systems, amongst others. Additionally, innovative methods for scrutinizing Maude and its extensions, including inductive theorem provers and various types of analysis, are anticipated.

Full Maude's ability to support object-oriented specifications and sophisticated module operations has been utilized to foster an environment conducive to language and logic development, leveraging Maude's meta-programming facilities. This approach has underpinned other development tools, like the Church-Rosser and coherence checkers, and even tools unrelated to Maude, such as a LOTOS tool.

The paper does not claim to offer a universal methodology for enhancing Full Maude but rather shares insights from experience with Real-Time Maude, a substantial development featuring new module syntax and additional analysis commands. Though Full Maude's implementation might be complex and has faced issues with robustness, the authors have worked to make such an extension both sturdy and capable of delivering intelligible diagnostic messages.

For further understanding, crafting an interpreter for a Maude subset has proven valuable, leading to Real-Time Maude, which incorporates new modules, rules, and analytical commands. This necessitates the tool to manage extra data types. The text also covers the importance of database management and error reporting, outlining how the system must store and track modules, theories, views, and default settings.

Eventually, the paper provides a detailed view of how the Real-Time Maude tool is built upon Full Maude, registering new forms of modules and offering commands for probing real-time systems, hence offering a thorough roadmap for others looking to extend Full Maude's capabilities.
