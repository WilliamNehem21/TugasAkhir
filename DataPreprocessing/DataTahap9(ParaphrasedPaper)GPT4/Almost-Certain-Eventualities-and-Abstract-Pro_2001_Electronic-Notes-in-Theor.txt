In the subsequent part of this section, we outline the transition systems that are the focus of our study. We examine the current frameworks in their conventional Boolean format as well as in a novel numerical variation in Sections 2 and 3. Our main findings are introduced in Sections 4 and 5, while Section 7 delves into the complexity of these systems.
