Hyperspectral imaging spectrometers are highly effective at gathering many spectral bands across various wavelengths for a particular area. These bands hold rich spectral information, allowing for the differentiation of similar materials. Each pixel band represents a continuous spectrum assigned to different class labels. However, a problem known as the Hughes phenomenon arises from the vast dimensionality and redundant information in these bands, which can reduce classification accuracy. Addressing this requires either feature extraction or feature selection methods to reduce data dimensionality and improve performance.

Feature extraction methods like PCA and ICA transform data from a high-dimensional space to a lower one, while feature selection methods choose a subset of original features to minimize redundancy. In the context of hyperspectral remote sensing, band selection involves picking the most informative bands, thereby streamlining data and increasing classification accuracy. This paper specifically focuses on the study of band selection methods.

Mutual Information (MI) has been frequently employed in band selection, showing that even with fewer bands, classification accuracy can be high. This paper focuses on using MI for band selection, aiming to select the most informative bands with the least number and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm through classification methods. The proposed algorithm's benefits include reduced false rate, quicker band selection, and improved accuracy.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 reviews related work on hyperspectral band selection and classification. Section 3 explains the Mutual Information and Otsu method (MI-OTSU) architecture and the proposed algorithm. Section 4 presents the results and discusses them, while Section 5 concludes with future work directions.

The paper introduces an adaptive MI concept that derives entropy and measures the dependency of two random variables using statistical methods for image fusion. Various techniques and algorithms are then detailed, each describing different methodologies for band selection and performance assessmentâ€”ranging from search-based methods, cluster-based MI approaches, to multi-objective models and novel algorithms like MIMR-DGSA and ISD-ABC. Each method aims to reduce dimensionality, minimize redundancy, and ultimately enhance classification accuracy.

The results demonstrate that by using MI-based approaches, fewer bands can be selected while maintaining or even improving classification performance. The proposed MI-OTSU algorithm applied on the AVIRIS dataset showed a higher accuracy rate than previous methods, validating the efficiency of the approach.

In conclusion, the paper addresses the need for effective band selection in hyperspectral imaging and demonstrates the central role of mutual information in improving selection techniques. Future research will focus on further refining extraction and classification methods, as well as addressing issues like spectral unmixing.
