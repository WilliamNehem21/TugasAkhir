The paper's structure was outlined in a previous section, which included reference to earlier research. Following an introduction in Section 2, the paper details findings on higher-order temporal logic (HTL) containing at least two variables in Section 3, and findings on a subset of that logic, HTL1, in Section 4. The conclusion is presented in Section 5. Due to space constraints, the paper skims over some proofs, particularly those validating formula translations. The authors have attempted to construct the formulas in such a way that their validity should be readily apparent to readers.
