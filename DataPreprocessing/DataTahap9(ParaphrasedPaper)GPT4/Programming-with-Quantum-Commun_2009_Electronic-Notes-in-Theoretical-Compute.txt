This academic paper discusses the field of quantum communication, which involves transferring quantum states across different physical locations. Quantum communication can be performed either by sending a quantum bit (qubit) through a quantum communication channel, analogous to classical communication, or without a quantum channel by using a classical communication channel paired with entangled quantum states and local quantum operations.

The paper focuses on quantum predicative programming, a branch of computer science that utilizes mathematical and logical tools in software engineering, particularly for formal methods. Formal methods help to express specifications formally, prove correctness of implementations, and analyze properties such as implementability and time-space complexity.

Quantum predicative programming, the central topic of this work, is an extension of classic predicative programming tailored to quantum computing. It allows for the development of programs with proven correctness at each step. Quantum programming theory provides the means to craft both classical and quantum specifications, develop quantum programs that meet these specifications, and analyze the programs in terms of time, space, and communication complexity.

The paper is structured to introduce quantum predicative programming followed by the main contribution, a formal framework for specifying, implementing, and analyzing quantum communication protocols. This includes the analysis of quantum teleportation and quantum dense coding protocols. Conclusions and future research directions are discussed towards the end.

Quantum teleportation is detailed as a method to transfer a qubit's state by entangling it with another qubit, performing quantum operations, and sending classical information to a receiver who then restores the state. By contrast, quantum dense coding is described as a protocol that sends two classical bits using a single qubit through an entangled pair, achieving the opposite goal of quantum teleportation.

The framework in the paper allows for formal proof of the complexity of quantum communication protocols, including the number of classical and quantum bits transmitted.

Lastly, the paper briefly touches upon quantum mechanics basics relevant to quantum computing models, while specifically focusing on the computation model rather than the underlying physical phenomena like spin1-particles. For a broader understanding of quantum computing, the paper suggests consulting comprehensive resources in the field.
