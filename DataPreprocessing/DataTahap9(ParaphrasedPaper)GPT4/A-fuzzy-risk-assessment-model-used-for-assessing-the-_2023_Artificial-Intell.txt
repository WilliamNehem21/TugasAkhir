This paper discusses strategies to mitigate the risk of African swine fever (ASF) outbreaks by understanding its transmission routes. These routes include wild boars, domestic swine, swine products, and Ornithodoros ticks. Human activity is recognized as a major factor for long-distance virus spread, demonstrated by incidents in Russia and Europe and recently in Timor-Leste.

The study adopts a fuzzy logic approach, utilizing a triangular membership function, as commonly used in similar risk assessment models. The model's validity is compared with a qualitative method from the UK's Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA), which categorized ASF risk into five levels. DEFRA's analysis, which considers trade data and ASF's environmental persistence, aligns with the paper's fuzzy risk assessment model on certain factors.

When applying the model, it's noted that perceptions of risk levels may vary slightly due to the proximity of data to the boundaries between fuzzy set categoriesâ€”in some cases, data that is on the cusp of one category, such as a 'very low' risk that is close to being 'low,' can influence the final risk outcome. The impact of international travel, a critical factor for ASF spread, has decreased due to pandemic-related restrictions on travel, suggesting trade might present a higher future risk. However, as travel normalizes, this risk is expected to resurface by 2023.

The paper's main contributions are twofold: establishing a fuzzy logic-based ASF risk assessment model and using this model to evaluate Australia's risk. The analysis suggests that Australia has a low ASF risk and notes a downward trend in risk associated with international tourists between 2019 and 2020. Imports and flights from Asian countries present the highest risk of ASF introduction. The study's insights aim to inform Australian customs and biosecurity agencies to bolster defenses against ASF.
