The paper presents an approach for integrating first-order logic formulas into the premises of structural operational semantics (SOS), forming a variant called FOL-SOS. The authors argue that for most applications, including all practical ones, SOS augmented with first-order logic has the same expressive power as traditional SOS. They also provide a format for proving congruence for strong bisimilarity, noting its close relationship with the existing NTYFT/NTYXT format.

The paper highlights that FOL-SOS deviates from traditional Transition System Specifications (TSS) by allowing unbound variables only in the source of a rule's conclusion. While traditional SOS often omits set notations due to minimal premises, FOL-SOS maintains them for better clarity and comparison. The binding of variables is implicit in FOL-SOS, reducing the gap between traditional and new TSS formats.

In FOL-SOS, premises in the rules are represented as a single formula connected by conjunctions, which differs from traditional SOS rules that list premises individually. Section 3.3 of the paper provides rules in FOL-SOS, illustrating that incorporating first-order logic into premises enhances the succinctness without increasing expressiveness for well-defined TSSs.

The introduction of formulas as premises necessitates examining the literal set used in each formula. To manage the complexity added by first-order logic formulas in premises, the paper defines functions (DV for Distinct Variables and UBRHS for Unbound in Right-Hand Side) to handle the uniqueness of variables and to identify free variables in the right-hand sides of literals, respectively.

The paper defines FOL-TSS in the FOL-TYFT and FOL-TYXT formats, where a FOL-TSS adheres to the FOL-TYFT format, the FOL-TYXT format, or the combined FOL-TYFT/TYXT format based on the structure of its rules. Several examples are used to illustrate compliance with these formats.

The authors demonstrate that FOL-SOS—with first-order logic fully integrated into premises—provides an intuitive semantics closely aligned with traditional semantics while also extending the NTYFT/NTYXT congruence format. Though the new format is more expressive, it offers a conservative extension. They also mention the need for a translation from TSSs to FOL-TSSs that preserves some logical structure of the deduction rules for a comparative analysis with an existing format (UNTYFT/UNTYXT).

The paper achieves its goal by illustrating that FOL-SOS retains the expressive power of traditional SOS and provides a more concise specification method while maintaining congruence with bisimilarity and fitting into a framework compatible with former semantic formats.
