The paper discusses the detrimental effects of oxidative stress, which arises from an imbalance between the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and an organism's ability to neutralize them or repair the damage they cause. It focuses particularly on the role of ROS in DNA damage, mutation, and changes in gene expression, which are key factors in the development of cancer. The study highlights the preventative and beneficial effects of superoxide dismutase (SOD) against various diseases, including ischemic-reperfusion injury, inflammation, and cancer. Three types of SOD enzymes exist in humans, with SOD1 located in the cytoplasm, SOD2 in the mitochondria, and SOD3 outside cells. The research notes the purification of Mn-SOD from various sources and its potential as an anticancer agent in inhibiting tumor cells.

The paper also explores the application of heparin and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) in cancer treatment, based on their anticoagulant properties and observed influence on patient survival rates. Heparin is described as a type of glycosaminoglycan and is investigated for its anti-metastatic effects.

A specific extraction and purification process from Raphanus sativus roots is detailed, which yields a protein with SOD activity. Biochemical assays are used to measure various components such as RNA content, total lipids, and serum alanine transaminase (ALT), among others.

The study reports on the presence of malondialdehyde (MDA) in cancer tissues and its correlation with cancer progression. Interestingly, it mentions that LMWH can decrease MDA levels and bolster SOD activity, demonstrating the protective antioxidant effects of R. sativus.

Angiogenesis in cancer, influenced by hemostatic system interactions with tumor cells, is also discussed. Treatments that include heparin, LMWH, and other molecules can suppress multiple steps in angiogenesisâ€”a process also tied to the production of growth factors like VEGF.

Overall, the study suggests that the natural and partially purified proteins derived from R. sativus roots, along with LMWH, could inhibit the growth of cancer cells through various mechanisms, including their antioxidant and anti-angiogenic properties. These findings indicate potential therapeutic benefits in cancer treatment, whereby such extracts and compounds may protect tumor suppressor genes from free radical damage, enhance the immune system, and result in anticancer effects.
