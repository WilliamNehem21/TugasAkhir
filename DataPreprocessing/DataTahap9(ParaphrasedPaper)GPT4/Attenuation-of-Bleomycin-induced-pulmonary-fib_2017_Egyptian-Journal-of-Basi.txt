Pulmonary fibrosis is a fatal lung disease characterized by inflammation that leads to the destruction of the alveolar structures, the buildup of myofibroblasts, transformation of the lung tissue, and an excess of extracellular matrix.

Bleomycin (BLM) is an antibiotic used in chemotherapy for various cancers, including lymphomas and testicular cancer. However, it can also cause significant alterations that can lead to pulmonary fibrosis, as seen through changes like bronchial cell changes, recruitment of different macrophages, unusual alveolar cells, fluid build-up, and fibrosis in the lung tissue.

Flavocoxid, a medical food containing two flavonoids, catechin and baicalin, is used for the management of osteoarthritis and is unique in that it modifies cyclooxygenase enzymes through anti-peroxidase activity and blocks the production of leukotrienes by 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX). Its strong antioxidant properties help reduce the expression of inflammation-inducing genes and neutralize reactive oxygen species, preventing the oxidation of arachidonic acid.

In the study, pulmonary fibrosis was induced in rats through intratracheal administration of BLM. The rats were anesthetized and BLM was instilled directly into their tracheas. After the procedure, the animals were rotated to distribute BLM evenly throughout the lungs before the incision was closed and treated with sodium fusidate.

The control group received a 0.5% carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) solution orally for five weeks after BLM instillation. In comparison, the group treated with flavocoxid received the drug orally for one week prior to BLM instillation and continued for four additional weeks after.

The results were assessed four weeks after BLM administration. The animals were deeply anesthetized, blood samples were collected, serum was separated for analysis, and lungs were examined â€“ weighed, the left lobes homogenized for testing, and the right lobes prepared for microscopic examination of the tissue structures.

This study highlights the potential lung-protecting effects of flavocoxid against BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis. It was observed that BLM caused oxidative stress, upsetting the balance of oxidants and antioxidants, indicated by increased lung malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and reduced glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and serum total antioxidant capacity (TAC). Furthermore, BLM led to increased lung nitric oxide (NO) levels. Histological examination revealed lung structure changes and increased collagen deposition, which were significantly improved with flavocoxid treatment, suggesting its beneficial role in reducing lung collagen and excess extracellular matrix buildup associated with pulmonary fibrosis.
