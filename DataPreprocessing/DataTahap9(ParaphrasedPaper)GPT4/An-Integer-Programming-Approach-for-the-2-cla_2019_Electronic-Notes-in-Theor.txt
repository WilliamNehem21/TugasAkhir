The paper discusses a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) approach that uses binary variables for grouping data points while excluding continuous variables which define hyperplanes between different groups. This simplification uses binary variables to assign points to a single group per class, identifying the chosen points and excluding outliers. Extension to multiple groups per class is straightforward.

Regarding the optimal value of the MIP, itâ€™s noted that a big positive number, denoted by 'm', ensures non-negativity. This is in line with a classical theorem by Balas, confirming the practical utility of the model because its linear nature allows for efficient solving.

The feasibility of the linear model isn't affected by the actual magnitude of the chosen 'm'. Although picking too small a value for 'm' could lead to poor solutions, the problem would still be solvable. For meaningful results, 'm' should be set significantly higher than the data's range.

Finally, the paper compares different implementations of the algorithm. The first has 'z-variables' without constraints, with lazy constraints added as needed. The second approach applies integer-programming-based cuts. The comparisons utilized Java for programming, with CPLEX 12.8 for solving the linear relaxations, feasibility checks, and solving the MIP separation issues.
