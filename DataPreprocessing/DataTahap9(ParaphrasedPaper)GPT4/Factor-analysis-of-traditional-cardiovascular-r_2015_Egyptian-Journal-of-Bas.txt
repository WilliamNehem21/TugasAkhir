Over the past twenty years, there has been a significant increase in cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) globally, and India has particularly high rates. Data on CVDs among Indian adolescents are scarce, even though evidence from global epidemiological studies indicates a rise in cardiovascular risk factors within this age group. A key factor contributing to this rise is adolescent obesity, which is linked to hypertension in adulthood. Genetic factors may also play a role in elevated blood pressure in children. Studies in the Indian context have demonstrated a strong correlation between body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and skinfold thickness with hypertension, dyslipidemia, and ischemic heart disease.

There is recognition of ethnic differences in risk factors for hypertension across diverse populations, and anthropometric measures such as BMI, WC, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and skinfold thickness are often used to predict CVD risk. Advanced statistical methods, including principal component factor analysis (PCFA), have been employed to better identify these risks by finding uncorrelated factors from a set of interrelated variables.

The current study examined traditional risk factors for CVD using PCFA among 3060 adolescents (1530 boys and 1530 girls) from urban areas of Punjab, a prosperous state in India. Standard techniques were used to measure various anthropometric aspects, such as height, weight, waist circumference, and skinfolds at the biceps, triceps, and subscapular regions. The data were collected from educational institutes through a two-stage random sampling process, with approval from the Guru Nanak Dev University ethical research committee.

The findings revealed differences between boys and girls in measurements like height, weight, and waist circumference, as well as blood pressure values. Furthermore, separate factors were associated with obesity and blood pressure-related traits, pointing out gender variations in cardiovascular risk profiles.

This study, while presenting important insights into cardiovascular risk factors among Punjabi adolescents, also notes limitations, such as inconsistent loading patterns for various variables, the cross-sectional nature of the study, and the exclusion of certain risk traits with low eigenvalues from the analysis.

The study supports the notion that the clustering of cardiovascular risk factors should be given more attention than focusing on individual traits, due to the complex nature of cardiovascular-related phenotypes. The findings emphasize the need for more research in this area, as existing studies are limited, particularly among Indian adolescents. This research could contribute to the development of targeted prevention strategies for CVDs in this young population.
