The academic paper outlines the use of descriptive statistics to summarize the dataset and the implementation of multiple regression analysis to evaluate the proposed research model. To identify differences in student demographics, t-tests and ANOVA were applied. The paper confirms that attitude, subjective norm, and university support significantly influence behavioral intention (BI) at the 0.1% level, while perceived e-learning accessibility impacts BI at the 1% level, and internet self-efficacy is also significant but at a lower threshold.

The study explains that these factors together explain 56% of the variance in perceived usefulness (PU), with an effect size considered large by standards cited from Cohen (1988). Interestingly, the paper notes that internet experience did not show a significant association with PU, resulting in the rejection of the ninth hypothesis.

Gender analysis revealed that male students had a slightly higher intention to use e-learning compared to female students, although the difference was minimal. A subsequent t-test showed no significant difference in e-learning intentions based on students' residence.

The study also found external students were more inclined to use e-learning than regular students, possibly due to e-learning's inherent benefits like flexibility and interactivity. Furthermore, differences in intentions to embrace e-learning emerged across different faculties.

The paper suggests that to foster a positive attitude towards e-learning, particularly among male and external students, policymakers should emphasize e-learning's advantages, such as flexibility and the ability to foster communication between students and instructors, which can be instrumental in designing more effective e-learning systems.

Lastly, the paper acknowledges limitations in the study, mentioning the emerging nature of e-learning in Saudi Arabia, potential unrepresentativeness of the sample, and reliance on self-reported measures, cautioning that these could restrict the generalizability of the findings and highlighting the need to consider these limitations when interpreting results.
