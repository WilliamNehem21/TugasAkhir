Remark 4.3: Usually, the context of operation (cop) as introduced in Definition 4.1 takes the form of a context with a single structure but multiple "holes" when we are dealing with representations of operations such as input prefixing, combining processes in parallel, or copying them infinitely (replication). It's important to point out that when the encoding preserves the structure of the operation (op) being encoded (referred to as being homomorphic with respect to op), the context of operation (cop) will then consist of a straightforward structure with multiple placeholders (holes) within it.
