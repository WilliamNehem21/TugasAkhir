The paper introduces TSAT++, an adaptable framework that implements the lazy SAT-based methodology for solving the Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) problem. SMT involves checking the consistency of propositional combinations of theory literals (T-literals), given a theory with known procedures to determine the satisfiability of its ground atoms.

TSAT++ features a flexible architecture allowing various enumerator algorithms and theory-specific satisfiability checkers, compatible with a clearly specified interface, to be integrated. This system supports numerous optimization tactics that remain effective regardless of the theory or modules in use.

The paper describes the software structure of TSAT++, highlighting its use of C++ abstract classes to create interfaces for enumerator and satisfiability checker components. Modules, which must instantiate these interfaces, can freely choose their internal mechanics and optimizations. Still, they must provide compatibility with TSAT++'s data structures.

A critical aspect of TSAT++ is that it does not restrict the modules' methodologies but rather encourages innovation and heuristic development. This modularity is exemplified in the enumerator's ability to dynamically expand its formula, a task that can be approached by either employing a standard SAT solver or customizing one for greater flexibility and efficiency.

One advanced optimization method involves using partial assignments to generate constraints potentially more quickly than waiting for the enumerator to complete a model, akin to 'early pruning' or 'forward checking' in artificial intelligence research.

TSAT++ was specifically applied to separation logic (SL), a decision problem that combines Boolean logic with arithmetic to address certain infinite-state system behaviors. The paper discusses the relevance of efficient decision procedures for SL due to its application in AI (like planning and scheduling) and formal methods (such as hardware safety and bounded model checking).

TSAT++ is designed to retain its modularity for ongoing improvement and extension, which the authors consider essential for flexibility and upgradeability. Despite the advantages, the paper also raises the question of keeping the system open without compromising its performance.

The paper concludes with experimental results demonstrating that TSAT++, configured for separation logic, performs competitively or even better than leading solvers specialized for the same logic.
