This paper delivers an introduction to the quantum functional programming language QML, detailing its syntax and providing a fresh look at the quantum teleportation algorithm in the context of this language. The paper explains the language's categorical operational semantics, illustrated through annotated quantum circuits, eventually linking to denotational semantics expressed via superoperators. The authors also showcase a implemented Haskell compiler that translates QML programs into diverse outputs: either quantum circuits (for operational semantics), isometries (for denotational semantics), or superoperators.

Advances in quantum computing have spurred the creation of QML to leverage formal reasoning and verification techniques from classical domains into quantum computing. QML's syntax and semantics have been reworked, correcting previous issues with coproduct interpretations and refining the concept of orthogonality within the language framework. The paper presents a QML compiler, written in Haskell, that concretizes the language's operational semantics. Specific Haskell modules handle aspects like orthogonality and circuit definitions, while the compiler itself employs advanced Haskell features such as monads.

The semantics of QML are deep-rooted in the categorical framework FQC, with ongoing work to directly implement denotational semantics independent of operational semantics. For updates and thorough information, the project's website is suggested as a resource.

The QML language and its compiler signify a progressive project, already operational, but open to future enhancements and features. The system actively supports the creation of novel language capabilities and the testing of new QML algorithms, using the teleportation algorithm as a notable example. Importantly, it offers a platform for those interested in quantum programming to test and observe program behavior in a familiar setting for those versed in computer science, logic, or physics with a functional programming background.

The paper also outlines prospective extensions to the compiler that might include exporting typed circuits as visual graphics or in formats compatible with applications such as MATLAB and Mathematica. Further exploration into connections with different formalisms like the measurement calculus and the Haskell QIO monad is anticipated, potentially fostering new advancements such as basis independence and other high-level abstractions.
