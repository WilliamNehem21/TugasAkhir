The set of term rewriting systems (TRSs) that fulfill the criteria laid out in Theorem 5.8 encompasses a broader range of systems than those that meet the requirements of Corollary 4.17. However, the subsets of semi-constructor TRSs and those TRSs that adhere to Theorem 5.8 are distinct; there is no inclusion relationship between them.

Putting into practice the approaches laid out in the proofs of Theorem 3.9, Theorem 4.15, and Theorem 4.22 is straightforward. Semi-constructor TRSs represent a relatively minor fraction of all TRSs, accounting for around 3% within the Termination Problem Database 4.0. The possibility to identify more decidable classes of TRSs exists, contingent upon the development of effective methods for approximating dependency pair graphs.
