The recent global rise in border-related crimes and unauthorized immigration can be attributed to insufficient authorization methods at border checkpoints. Current practices involve immigration officers manually comparing passports and individuals' physical characteristics, while some locations employ Automated Border Control (ABC) systems that use multimodal biometric authorization, such as fingerprint and facial recognition. Despite this technology's implementation, choosing the right classification method for decision-making remains complex.

This paper introduces a new architecture for multimodal biometric authorization, utilizing a Multi-Agent System (MAS), which leverages the collaborative features of MAS—coordination, cooperation, and negotiation—to identify optimal authorization solutions. The effectiveness of this method was tested and confirmed through experiments with four different multimodal datasets: NIST, SDUMLA-HMT, Banca, and a private database.

Biometric measures like fingerprints and facial patterns offer cost-effective and convenient identification methods that don't require memorization and are difficult to lose or steal. The rise of biometric systems for authorization results from improved computer security technologies. Multimodal systems are favored over unimodal systems due to their enhanced security, despite vulnerabilities to spoofing attacks in single traits. Traditional border controls have shown to be susceptible to criminal activities, heightening threats to national security, finance, and tourism, with illegal immigration posing significant concerns in some regions.

ABC systems, particularly e-gates, represent a major practical application of biometric technology. However, the real-world application of classification algorithms used in these systems poses challenges, especially under time constraints and with large datasets. Multi-classifiers are seen as more reliable than single classifiers, balancing the false positive and negative rates. This paper proposes a multimodal, multi-classifier architecture that employs a multi-agent approach to enhance the biometric authorization decision-making process, addressing the limitations of previous methods.

Experiments employed databases from NIST, SDUMLA-HMT, Banca, and private sources to measure accuracy and compare with previous models and existing ABC systems. The multi-agent-based system involves capturing facial and fingerprint data, preprocessing, using CNNs for biometric recognition, and agent negotiation to authenticate passengers. The uniqueness of this research lies in the application of a multi-agent methodology to select the best result from different classifier fusions. The approach uses four classifiers—CNNs with softmax, SVM, linear regression, and random forest—to process biometric data consented by individuals for research, showing promising results regarding recognition time and flexibility in practical applications.
