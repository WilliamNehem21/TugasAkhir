The academic paper discusses the creation of "Blender," a new tool for generating lexers and parsers that addresses the challenges of handling ambiguities encountered in embedded languages, legacy code, and voice programming. Traditional tools like Flex and Bison struggle with such ambiguities, but Blender and the Harmonia framework enhance incremental lexing and parsing algorithms to manage lexical, syntactic, and semantic ambiguities more effectively.

The paper outlines methods for dealing with four types of input streams with a focus on three ambiguous types, detailed in Section 3. The complexities of parsing embedded languages, a fifth type of input stream, are handled in Sections 4 to 7. Section 8 relates to work on similar issues.

Voice programming introduces homophones leading to potential ambiguities, with multiple spellings mapping to a single lexical type. Harmonia provides interactive services for programmers through editors like XEmacs and Eclipse, using plug-in modules for lexical, syntactic, and semantic definitions.

The paper also describes an incremental analysis framework, where straightforward language descriptions typically allow unambiguous lexing and parsing, with limited issues. Harmonia's framework delivers automated updates to parse trees with incremental lexing when edits occur, whether from keyboard input or spoken word recognition.

Blender further aids in specifying outer and inner languages of embedded languages independently, utilizing regular expressions and parsing techniques to identify language boundaries within a document. Lexical descriptions follow a Flex-like format, while grammars resemble Bison's style. Language descriptions in Blender can merge grammars of multiple languages, with each symbol tagged to maintain uniqueness.

Lastly, the paper touches on the potential for scannerless GLR parsers to adopt incrementality and the paper's proposed extensions, but with the caveat that the details and performance implications would need thorough consideration, especially without a lexer to define the potential changed regions precisely.
