In previous research, we explored using multi-task convolutional neural network (CNN) models to predict different in vitro drug clearance metrics based on molecular images. These CNNs effectively captured implicit chemical relationships in the images and performed as well or better than traditional machine learning and deep neural network methods trained with structure-based representations, including graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs). Our findings suggested that CNNs using molecular images could predict multiple drug clearance parameters effectively.

We expanded our research to determine if CNN models based on molecular images and GCNN models could explain chemical modifications related to intrinsic metabolic reactions, which is important for understanding drug metabolism. This impacts drug effectiveness, distribution, elimination processes, and safety, including issues like dosing, off-target effects, or reactivity.

Our models' interpretability was examined to see if they aligned with experimentally confirmed metabolic products. We used intrinsic clearance data from various species: human hepatocyte (HH Clint), human liver microsome (HLM Clint), rat hepatocyte (RH Clint), and dog hepatocyte (DH Clint) gathered internally from AstraZeneca. The dataset comprised 139,907 unique compounds.

To investigate metabolic pathways, liver microsomes and hepatocytes were used. Identifying metabolic products (metabolic identities or MetIDs) is essential for validating animal models for drug development and for protecting metabolic hotspots relevant to humans. For some intrinsic clearance measurements, qualitative liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis was performed.

However, the interpretability analysis of 185 molecules did not show a direct correlation with their MetID experiments, but since the models were predictive for singleton molecules, it's still possible they could interpret novel chemistry correctly. For example, HH Clint MetID for compound A showed 48% of the molecule remained unchanged, while 41% were metabolically transformed. Major transformation pathways included oxidation and glucuronidation.

In our case study, the GCNN highlighted the indazole ring as a key substructure for prediction, corroborated by MetID data suggesting N-glucuronidation. While the interpretability methods did not unanimously identify all metabolic reactions, they provided complementary insights.

Overall, we demonstrated that interpretability models derived from CNNs and GCNNs could partially explain metabolic transformations. This could offer significant value in understanding drug metabolism and developing safer, more effective therapeutics, even though the interpretability methods did not fully align with experimental data.
