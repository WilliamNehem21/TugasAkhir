After introducing the Baire metric, a plethora of classical metric (or topological) techniques become available. The Baire distance can be expanded to the Hausdorff distance for sets of entities, enabling the representation of various indeterminate concepts. We aim to work with sets of meanings that include all pertinent limits, which necessitates using closed subsets and complete spaces. Many of the programming concepts we consider naturally give rise to a notion of an initial computational step, which then leads to the remainder of the computation. Often, this corresponds to the associated semantic function exhibiting contractive behavior. We recall that the Banach Fixed Point Theorem states that each contractive function on a complete metric space has a unique fixed point. This theorem is central in metric semantics, serving both as a foundational and a proof principle. Additionally, regarding topology: transition systems may meet one of two finiteness conditionsâ€”they may be finitely branching or image finite. A key finding in metric semantics is that the operational semantics linked with a finitely branching (image finite) transition system forms a compact (closed) set.
