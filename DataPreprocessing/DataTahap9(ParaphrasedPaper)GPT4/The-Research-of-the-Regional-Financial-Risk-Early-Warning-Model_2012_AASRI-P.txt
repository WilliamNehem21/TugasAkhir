Financial risks at a regional level are not solely determined by external factors; they are also shaped by unique local economic conditions and market structures. The uneven progression of regional economies and financial systems lends a distinct regional aspect to financial risks. Moreover, regional financial systems often have a diminished capacity to withstand local disturbances, meaning that localized financial upheavals have the potential to escalate into wider regional or even national financial crises.

Regression analyses reveal that several factors—GDP growth, real estate price indices, expansion of broad money supply, credit balances, and the balance of international trade—tend to exert a positive influence on financial stress indicators. Conversely, the price volatility of crude oil, aggregate GDP, the ratio of broad money to GDP, the disparity in one-year deposit interest rates between China and the U.S., and Japanese GDP growth are likely to negatively impact these indicators. Despite the presence of collinearity among explanatory variables, which may compromise their accuracy, it does not invalidate their overall effectiveness in predicting financial stress when used in a general index like the Composite Financial Stress Index (CFSI).

Drawing from Illing and Liu’s (2003) research, this paper adopts the financial stress indicators they developed, using a synchronization index of financial risks to determine relevant explanatory variables and predict future conditions. Empirical methods are utilized to craft an early-warning model for financial stress, which indicates that variables lagging by four quarters (with some at six or eight quarters) can effectively forecast trends in financial stress indicators. This predictive capability means that known current financial stress levels, combined with other variable values, can be used to estimate financial stress over the upcoming four quarters.
