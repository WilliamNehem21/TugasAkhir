In the paper, the authors discuss the unique challenges of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), where nodes are constantly moving and there is no fixed infrastructure such as base stations. Communication in MANETs relies on a multi-hop approach, where packets are relayed through intermediate nodes when the source and destination are not within direct transmission range of each other.

Due to their self-configuring nature, MANETs are suited for diverse applications, including emergency response and military operations. However, ensuring Quality of Service (QoS), specifically in terms of delay performance, is critical and challenging because of node mobility, wireless channel interference, and complex packet routing processes. These dynamic behaviors impede the development of accurate theoretical models for end-to-end delay.

This paper presents a new approach to predict the delay between any two nodes in a MANET by considering historical delay data and current path length. A weighted delay prediction model is proposed, using regression for path length and a fuzzy time series method for historical delays. The fuzzy time series utilizes trapezoidal fuzzy numbers, chosen for their proven prediction accuracy compared to triangular numbers.

To validate the model, the authors established criteria, such as root mean squared error (RMSE), correlation coefficient, and efficiency, comparing the model's predictions against actual observations to determine the most suitable model.

The paper reviews various past efforts for predicting delays in networks, many of which were limited by their scope or methodology. For instance, some studies considered only single-hop delays or were restricted to internet delay predictions, lacking the comprehensive approach necessary for MANET environments.

The authors emphasize the importance of considering node mobility patterns and advocate for a comprehensive analysis tool that can account for the complex, dynamic conditions of MANETs. They mention several studies that have tackled different aspects of MANET delay, such as the relationship between processing delay and neighbor count or the influence of node mobility on throughput and delay.

Finally, they highlight their contribution: combining regression and fuzzy time series approaches and leveraging historical delay data with current conditions to predict future delays, a method that can be beneficial for a variety of applications and network conditions within MANETs.
