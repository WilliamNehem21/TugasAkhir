This academic paper discusses performance metrics and optimization approaches in control system engineering, as well as provides brief biographical information on the researchers involved.

- The performance of a control system can be evaluated using various integral-based objective functions such as Integral of Time-weighted Absolute Error (ITAE), Integral of Squared Error (ISE), Integral of Time multiplied by Squared Error (ITSE), and Integral of Absolute Error (IAE). Studies [21-23, 27, 28] provide details on how these functions affect system performance, while references [35, 36] indicate that ITAE often yields superior system performance. Consequently, ITAE is selected as the objective function in this paper.

- The paper also describes a method for generating random fractals through a diffusion process. An initial particle is placed and subsequent particles are randomly created around it. As positions update, only the best particles from the diffusion process are retained. This technique aims to help algorithms avoid local minima and more effectively seek global minima. The approach uses a Gaussian random strategy to enhance search space exploration, hence introducing diversification into the Scatter Search Foundation (SFS) algorithm.

- After conducting 25 runs, optimal integral gains are chosen. These gains are then fine-tuned using the Particle Swarm (PS) algorithm, with the SFS-derived controller parameters serving as starting points in the PS algorithm.
