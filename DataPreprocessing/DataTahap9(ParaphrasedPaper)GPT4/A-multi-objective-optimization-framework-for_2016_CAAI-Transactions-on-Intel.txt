This academic paper discusses the challenge of solving ill-posed image inverse problems that lack unique solutions and often involve conflicting or mixed-type objectives. The authors propose a multi-objective optimization (MO) framework which employs multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) to navigate trade-offs among different objectives, aiming to find a balance between them. Two case studies are presented: sparse reconstruction and change detection.

In sparse reconstruction, measurement error and sparsity are the two conflicting objectives optimized by MOEAs. The goal is to maintain a balance between encouraging sparsity of solutions and reducing measurement errors. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through applications in natural image denoising and hyperspectral data unmixing.

For change detection, particularly in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, the proposed framework deals with objectives of noise robustness and detail preservation. The paper shows that the MO framework is successful through experiments with simulated and real datasets.

The paper not only introduces the MO framework but also details how multi-objective evolutionary strategies, like the Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), can evolve populations to find Pareto optimal solutions. Within this context, the authors discuss various techniques, including sparse unmixing and methods to combat speckle noise in change detection, improving the fidelity of detection results.

The research highlights the efficacy of the MO framework in addressing challenges specific to ill-posed inverse problems in image processing. The frameworks validation is supported by quantitative measures such as missed alarms, false alarms, and the kappa coefficient, ultimately suggesting a noteworthy advancement for applications in fields like mineral exploration, environmental monitoring, and military surveillance.
