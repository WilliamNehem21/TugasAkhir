The paper aims to analyze how teleconsultation, specifically e-health services, satisfies the needs of vulnerable and disadvantaged populations. It examines how teleconsultation can support people in low-income and medically at-risk groups globally, emphasizing COVID-19 management, treatment, and prevention from a human rights perspective.

The study compares distributed electronic health records (EHR) with centralized EHRs and highlights the advantages of the former, such as flexibility and improved data recovery. It notes that urban populations are more familiar with centralized systems and discusses the lack of a contingency plan as a shortcoming of centralized EHRs. The proposed solution is an interoperable distributed EHR system designed with loosely coupled data for flexibility and an incorporated master patient index (MPI) for data recovery.

The paper is structured into five sections. After the introduction, a review of related literature is provided, followed by a description of the proposed system's architecture and development. The fourth section presents experimental results and their evaluation, while the conclusion is offered in the fifth section.

The study was motivated by examining recent developments in e-health systems. It references literature that sheds light on the cost-effectiveness of telehealth and e-health for primary care patients and the robust improvements in e-health services facilitated by the availability of smart devices and systems.

It appraises various methods and technologies related to distributed EHR systems, identifying benefits, results, and limitations. The paper also outlines the development of two login modules within the system – one for clients (rural patients) and one for local doctors – detailing how patients in rural areas access e-health services through a remote health care center or pharmacy.

The significance of the proposed distributed e-health system for health care in developing countries is underscored, noting how it addresses current challenges by offering sustainable advancements. Distributed e-health is proposed to enhance public health and improve health outcomes cost-effectively by facilitating remote patient interactions, fast access to medical care specialists, and remote monitoring capabilities. With ICT tools becoming more widespread in the third world, a surge in e-health and medical IT is expected in these regions.

Experimental findings highlight several challenges with transitioning from hospital-based to electronic healthcare services, including organizational, cultural, and technical adjustments. The lack of comprehensive health standards and limited knowledge among rural doctors, patients, and health professionals are identified as obstacles to implementing a fully effective health care system.
