Oil-type transformers (OTTs) are predominantly used for electricity transmission and distribution due to their lower cost compared to dry-type transformers, making the cost factor critical in their usage. Transformer cost is significantly influenced by weight, which is determined by variables such as the core and winding weights, the iron cross section conformity factor (C), and the current density (S). This study introduces a novel approach using a hybrid gray wolf-whale optimization algorithm that diverges from past heuristic methods, achieving substantial weight reductions of 44% in distribution transformers and about 14% in power transformers, which also translates into similar cost savings.

The study also compared the new algorithm's performance with other optimization techniques and found positive results. In previous research, genetic algorithms were used to reduce the weight of dry-type transformers by optimizing the variable parameters. Particle swarm optimization and artificial neural network methodologies have also been applied with success to dry-type transformer design, and a micro genetic algorithm has been leveraged to optimize transformer designs.

The whale optimization algorithm (WOA) is employed in several optimization studies beyond transformers, including power system stability analysis, fault diagnosis in transformers (with a 94.05% accuracy and reduced error margin using a hybrid structure with genetic algorithms), and identifying optimal locations for electric vehicle charging stations.

Furthermore, the study showed that the gray wolf-whale optimization algorithm improved leadership parameters for leader-follower robots and proposed a multi-objective optimization framework (MO-HPM) for integrating electric vehicles into the harmonic power market within microgrids. This new market framework aims to balance various conflicting goals, including distortion costs and total harmonic distortion, using a hybrid algorithm that combines whale optimization, gray wolf optimization, and differential evolution.

The paper also described a hybrid algorithm for early breast cancer detection, which resulted in a 97.721% classification accuracy on the WDBC dataset, outperforming other models.

Overall, hybrid heuristic algorithms demonstrate potential advantages over traditional algorithms in terms of faster convergence and higher precision. Specifically, Gray Wolf Optimization, developed by Mirjalili et al., is noted for its quick convergence, while the Whale Optimization Algorithm is recognized for slower yet highly accurate convergence. The study concludes that by strategically combining algorithms, their complementary features can lead to superior optimization results, yielding cost efficiencies and potentially extending transformer longevity.
