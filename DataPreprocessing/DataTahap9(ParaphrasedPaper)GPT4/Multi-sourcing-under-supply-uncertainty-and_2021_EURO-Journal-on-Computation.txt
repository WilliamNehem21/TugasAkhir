Our study distinguishes itself from related research in several significant respects. Firstly, contrary to many previous models that concentrate on the limited availability of products from suppliers, our approach includes consideration of yield variations that can result in both insufficient and surplus supply. Indeed, as indicated by Dada et al. (2007), a purchaser will only obtain up to the ordered amount from a supplier, even if the supplier's yield exceeds expectations and results in an abundance of products.

Moreover, while conducting transactions in the spot market, research by Fafchamps and Hill (2005) shows that a farmer's propensity to sell to the market diminishes as the distance to the market increases, whereas the likelihood of selling at the farm gate is higher. Similarly, AAYOG (2017) notes that in India, direct purchases from farmers benefit both farmers and buyers by providing better prices and eliminating the need for intermediaries.

Lastly, although we employ a normal distribution to represent supply yields, consistent with general usage in operations management literature, our analytical model is adaptable to any probability distribution for supply yields.
