The paper discusses a comprehensive concept of components, yet acknowledges that the concept of state is somewhat vague. Rasche and Polze have adopted a pragmatic strategy for transferring state, which involves using an object-graph traversal algorithm and a mapping to facilitate a largely automated, direct method. Their system depends on an accounting mechanism to maintain state consistency. However, the paper notes that this component is prone to occasional failures, which can lead to a corrupted state, meaning no reliable assumptions can be made about it at that point. It is assumed that the component operates deterministically and that any errors are immediately reported back to the calling function, for example, by generating an exception in practical applications.
