This paper discusses results applicable to convex polytopes, which are geometric objects formed by the convex hull of a finite set of points. The authors explain that their findings also hold for any set of compact (closed and bounded) objects that can be continuously mapped onto convex polytopes by a homeomorphism, that is, a function that preserves spatial structures.

Throughout the paper, the term "tile" is used to describe a convex polytope in some n-dimensional space (Rn). The authors consider a collection of these tiles, denoted as P. They denote the union of all the tiles in P as U(P), indicating that while these tiles may cover portions of Rn, they may not cover the entire space and can overlap.

The paper discusses the concept of "contractibility" in the context of these tiles. A set is contractible if it can be continuously transformed into a single point set, meaning it's nonempty, connected, and has no holes. In two dimensions, this implies no holes; in three dimensions, it also implies no tunnels or cavities.

They highlight that in plane or 3D space, a polyhedron is contractible if and only if it meets these criteria: nonempty, connected, and devoid of holes, tunnels, or cavities in the 3D case.

The paper references a variety of theorems, including one that ensures a subcollection of a particular type of tile collection (SN collection) will inherit a property from the larger set, namely contractibility.

The authors mention their work on extending results from prior studies to set of tiles that satisfy certain topological conditions (SN sets) in n dimensions. They note they have not expanded these results to n dimensions generally due to computational complexity, particularly when considering the topological changes resulting from the removal of non-simple tiles in higher dimensions.

Lastly, the paper identifies areas for further research, including computational challenges related to recognizing simple tiles and the topological changes from deleting a tile in 4D or 5D spaces, which is relevant for analyzing images over time. The authors state that they are currently pursuing research in this area specifically for 4-dimensional spaces.
