Session types are a formalism to define the structure of communications between parties in multi-party systems, specifying the sequence and types of interactions. Correspondence assertions serve as a tool for managing synchronization. When combined, session types and correspondence assertions can capture synchronization among various communication channels, providing a comprehensive framework for defining sophisticated interaction patterns in complex communication scenarios.

Modern society increasingly relies on processors to operate and supervise devices in almost every domain. The reliable functioning of these devices often hinges on the correct interplay between various processors, which may be parts of a larger system or distributed across different locations. Ensuring the accuracy of the software that oversees these communications is vital, with critical applications ranging from space missions to air traffic management, healthcare, finance, and online transactions.

We start with a collection of identifiers (names) that fall into two categories: expression names, which can be session identifiers or integers, and channel names. Additionally, assertion labels are used in the form of begin and end statements. Effects keep track of the number of begin assertions, with begin reducing the count and end increasing it. If a process concludes without any effect, it implies that each end matches a corresponding begin.

Arithmetic operations, if not limited to decidable forms, necessitate a semi-decision procedure, which ensures an algorithm that can conclusively affirm the traceability of information without errors, or demonstrate a contradiction. However, the algorithm may not always terminate, and in such cases, no conclusion can be drawn.

For simplicity, we consider a scenario where an auctioneer can only handle one seller at a time and requires at least one buyer to submit a bid. We exclude error handling for simplicity, such as when a bid is made on an unsold item, and we start with predefined dummy seller and buyer roles. The auction process involves a buyer submitting a bid, which the auctioneer receives along with product and contact details, then relays this information to the buyer manager. The buyer manager compares the bid to the current highest bid, either updating the highest bidder and notifying any outbid participants or rejecting the bid if it's too low.

The example demonstrates a modification of the bidding process where a lower bid is placed than the one originally communicated to the auctioneer. Despite this change, the modified electronic auction system is still categorized as typable within the pure session types framework, pointing to certain limitations in expressiveness found within the pure theory of session types, as detailed in additional examples presented in the paper.
