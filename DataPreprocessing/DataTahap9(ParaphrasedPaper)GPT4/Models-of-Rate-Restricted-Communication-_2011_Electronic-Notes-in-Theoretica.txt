This academic paper discusses how utilization limits in CREOL models, a language for distributed active objects, can represent the behavior of radio message broadcasting and point-to-point communication. These limits are used to model constraints such as low-bandwidth connections between hardware systems or the maximum rate at which a component can accept communication, addressing issues like interference and message resending in radio communications.

The paper is structured into six sections, beginning with an introduction to Timed CREOL, followed by a proposal for modeling resource-constrained behaviors, development of a CREOL model for a bandwidth-limited wireless sensor network, discussion of related work, and concluding remarks.

CREOL is a modeling language with asynchronous method calls and processor release points. Objects in CREOL have their processes, with at most one active at any time, and communication occurs through asynchronous method calls leading to concurrent activities in the receiving object.

The paper describes how CREOL can simulate system behavior with rate restrictions using MAUDE, an interpreter, illustrating this with a client-server example and a model of a wireless sensor network. Bandwidth restrictions are particularly important in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) because the energy used for transmission significantly impacts efficiency and node longevity.

The authors simulate random network topologies to demonstrate that as network bandwidth decreases, the time for messages to reach a central sink increases, providing insights into the timing behavior of arbitrary sensor networks.

Finally, the paper differentiates between measurement-based and model-based techniques for predicting or analyzing non-functional properties of networks. It argues that while simulators like ns-2 and OMNeT++ offer insights, their assumptions on lower-level layers can lead to varied results. In contrast, abstract simulations with formal models allow for a more systematic exploration of the execution space, without depending on specific details of the physical and medium access control layers, thus offering flexibility for simulation scenarios.
