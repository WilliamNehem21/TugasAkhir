Anomaly detection aims to identify rare items, events, or observations that raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data. Typically, attributed networks contain rich information from user features to connections among users. Detecting anomalies in these networks has gained interest due to its practical uses in social networks, biological data analysis, and finance. Applications include spotting fake social media profiles, financial fraud, and network intrusions.

Traditional machine learning requires labeled data and struggles with data imbalance. To overcome the limitation of labeling, unsupervised approaches assume the majority of data is normal to identify anomalies. Recently, neural network-based methods like autoencoders, and in particular variational autoencoders (VAEs), have advanced anomaly detection. VAEs leverage reconstruction probability rather than error, improving performance.

Data in the real world can be sparse and noisy, which poses challenges for embedding methods. Regularizing latent codes to reflect the data's underlying distribution has shown promise. The proposed Adversarial Regularized Dual Graph VAE addresses anomalies in social networks as an unsupervised solution. It employs two VAEs for non-linear data and network sparsity, producing probabilistic representations for variability. Generators create false nodes while adversarial training ensures latent codes align with a set distribution, improving the graph's representation fidelity.

Anomaly detection is crucial across sectors from finance to network security, improving decision-making, risk reduction, and process optimization. Our study contributes by introducing adversarial elements to a dual VAE model, enhancing the encoding process. By matching encoded data distribution with the true data distribution, the anomaly detection becomes more accurate.

Autoencoders separate input data into reconstructible parts and noise, while Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) create low-dimensional embeddings capturing topological structure and node characteristics. Adversarial methods, rooted in GANs, have been adapted from the success in computer vision to handle graph data. These advances culminate in our Adversarial Regularized Dual Graph VAE.

The paper is structured to introduce our methodology, evaluate it through practical assessments, and conclude its implications. Analysis of three datasets (BlogCatalog, Flickr, and Enron) shows the model's effectiveness, with the potential to enhance anomaly detection in complex data settings. Implications are widespread: from improved safety in online platforms to strategic data science management, indicating the need for context-sensitive modeling, adversarial strengthening of models, and the benefits of regularizing latent codes.

In summary, the research underlines the importance of reliable anomaly detection methods, high-quality data management, and adaptable approaches to complex data issues. Businesses can leverage these insights to secure their platforms and make more informed decisions. Future research aims to deepen the understanding of the adversarial approach's effectiveness.
