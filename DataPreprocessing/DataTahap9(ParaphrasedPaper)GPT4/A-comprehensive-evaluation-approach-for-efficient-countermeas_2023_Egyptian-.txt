The academic paper explores the evaluation of countermeasures against timing side-channel attacks (TSCAs) in multi-processor system-on-chips (MPSoCs) used within Internet of Things (IoT) platforms. The evaluation of these countermeasures is framed as a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem, which considers architecture performance and design overhead among other criteria.

A method named Fermatean Fuzzy Decision Opinion Score Method (F-FDOSM) is proposed as the optimal approach for prioritizing countermeasures against TSCAs because it is the most efficient MCDM ranking technique. However, this method requires criteria to be weighted before the ranking process. To resolve this, the Criteria-Importance Through Inter-Criteria Correlation (CRITIC) method is recommended for effectively weighting the criteria based on standard deviation and correlation analysis, ensuring the determination of each criterion's relevance without inconsistency.

Key findings of the study include:
1. In the CRITIC weighting, MPSoC NoC throughput (packet/clock) is assigned the highest weight while latency (clock/cycle) is given the least weight.
2. Group ranking using Fermatean FDOSM determined that the adaptive routing countermeasure technique scored the highest compared to a hybrid approach combining a separate interface.
3. The priority rankings of TSCA-CTS were subjected to systematic ranking and demonstrated a strong correlation across ten criterion weight values. Comparisons with recent studies validated the feasibility of the proposed framework.

The paper highlights the vulnerability of MPSoCs to hardware and software attacks, especially given their significant role in critical applications and resource sharing. These attacks can damage systems, compromise information, or disrupt applications at either the computational level (e.g., processors, memory, I/O peripherals) or the communication level (e.g., network-on-chip). The threat these attacks pose necessitates research into defensive strategies to protect data security.

The study is structured into several sections: a state-of-the-art literature review of TSCAs in MPSoCs, studies on FDOSM and CRITIC methods, a comprehensive methodology overview, discussion of study results indicating the effectiveness of CRITIC criteria weighting and Fermatean FDOSM ranking methods, and the conclusion.

The literature review covers three aspects:
1. Recent research on TSCAs affecting MPSoCs, focusing on countermeasures, specifically targeting IP core caches and NoC.
2. The FDOSM method, its current use, and developments.
3. Recent studies involving fuzzy set systems.

The review identifies that countermeasures against TSCAs in the context of MPSoCs can be mainly categorized into traffic partitioning and route randomization. Traffic partitioning aims to isolate secure application packet flow from non-secure ones, thereby improving security, but potential sub-optimal resource division might impact performance.

Lastly, the paper validates the group decision-making evaluation results for TSCA-CTS countermeasures by dividing techniques into two groups, aggregating all opinion matrices, and then creating a unified matrix to justify the evaluation process.
