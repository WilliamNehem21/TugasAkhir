This academic paper discusses the challenges of managing congestion in the power sector as a result of transformational changes, emphasizing the critical role of the transmission sector which is considered the backbone of the power industry. It highlights the significance of transmission pricing in fostering fair competition within the electricity sector and providing accurate economic signals for efficient operation.

The paper also reviews various approaches for allocating transmission losses, categorizing existing methods into four main types: prorata methods, marginal methods, power flow tracing-based methods, and circuit theory based methods. Additionally, it mentions a proposed usage-based transmission loss allocation method and a circuit theory-based method utilizing the concept of orthogonal projection for pool-based electricity markets.

The core contribution of the paper is the introduction of a new model for allocating usage, losses, and transmission reliability margins using matrix methodology. In this proposed method, a modified Kirchhoff matrix is utilized for usage allocation. Following this, a loss allocation matrix is constructed to allocate transmission losses to both loads and generators. To ensure reliability, the method incorporates the (N-1) reliability criterion to calculate the maximum flow of transmission lines. Finally, the transmission reliability margin (TRM) for each transmission line is allocated to generators using the modified Kirchhoff matrix.
