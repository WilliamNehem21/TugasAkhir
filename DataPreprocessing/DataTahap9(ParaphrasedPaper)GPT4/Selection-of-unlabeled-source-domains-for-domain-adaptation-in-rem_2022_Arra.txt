Supervised domain adaptation techniques leverage labeled data from both the source and the much smaller target domainâ€”using only supervised learning within the target domain would suffice if it had enough labeled data. In contrast, unsupervised domain adaptation does not use labeled data in either domain. However, semi-supervised domain adaptation is suitable for scenarios where the source domain provides prior knowledge absent in the target domain, and despite differing joint distributions, the domains share sufficient relevance to be beneficial for prediction tasks in the target domain.

This paper explores methods to identify the best source-target domain matches by calculating various similarity metrics and employing ensemble pruning to determine the most effective metrics. Additionally, they implement a voting method to select the best source-target pair and build a regression model based on this choice.

Initial findings indicate that unadapted models, although the least accurate, still maintain a degree of effectiveness across domains due to the robustness of spectral-spatial features. Domain alignment significantly reduces mean absolute error (MAE), and the proposed method of selecting the right source domain for an aligned target domain offers an average improvement of approximately 4.7 to 4.9 percentage points for built-up density and height predictions, respectively. As expected, models trained and tested within the same domain have the lowest MAEs, suggesting an error cost associated with gathering training data for a new domain.

Finally, the paper promotes the ongoing application of their method to remote sensing data analysis and plans to extend the method to multiple image modalities and integrate it into supervised multitask ensemble learning models. They highlight the method's modular design and its independence from specific learning algorithms.
