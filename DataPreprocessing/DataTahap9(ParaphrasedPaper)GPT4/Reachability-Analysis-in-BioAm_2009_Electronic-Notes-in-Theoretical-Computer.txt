Here is a paraphrased version of your provided academic text:

To illustrate an application of reachability analysis, consider a scenario where a drug, carried within a transporter molecule, is introduced into a patient's bloodstream. The designed behavior of the transporter is to ensure that the drug is specifically delivered to muscle tissue rather than connective tissue. This biological system can be modeled by a bioambient process.

In related research, Busi and Zavattaro expanded the concept of reachability within mobile ambients by defining a broader notion they named target reachability. This concept allows for identifying a potentially infinite set of target structures using ambient nesting patterns and specifying minimum and maximum limits on the quantity of certain process instances within each ambient. Additionally, they established the decidability of target reachability when considering a more complex calculus that includes advanced communication features found in boxed ambients.

The proof that target reachability is decidable relied on converting the problem to one of Petri net marking reachabilityâ€”a known decidable issue with Petri nets. This conversion occurred in two stages: defining target marking reachability for Petri nets and demonstrating its equivalence to standard marking reachability, followed by mapping target reachability from bioambients to target marking reachability within Petri nets. Due to space constraints and since the proof closely resembles previous arguments for boxed ambients, the details are excluded here but can be found in the extended version of the paper and other literature.

Proposition 3.9 argues that a target marking in a place/transition (P/T) system is reachable if and only if it's possible to reach one of the markings from a specific subset related to the target marking within a modified P/T system.

However, the problem becomes complex when considering the potentially unending growth of processes within an ambient. For example, a particular process setup can show that an ambient's containment can expand indefinitely, complicating the analysis.

To tackle this issue, researchers constructed a Petri net composed of two segments. The first part resembles a finite state machine, with a marked place representing the current state of the process's tree-like structure. The second part consists of several identical subnets, each marking corresponding to the list of processes associated with a particular tree node. Labels are used to maintain the correspondence between tree nodes and their related subnets, with each subnet given a unique label. This label identifies the node content within the tree structure, which includes sub-processes that are both guarded and duplicated.
