This paper discusses the position of domain theory among mathematical disciplines, and the pressures these disciplines face to justify their relevance, particularly through their applications. It notes that while mathematical fields such as number theory have a rich history and accessible problems, domain theory is more akin to general topology, serving as a conceptual framework but not necessarily aimed at solving specific problems. However, unlike general topology—which is often viewed merely as foundational—the viability of domain theory depends on its ability to interact with other research fields, both within and beyond mathematics.

The paper then identifies five distinct origins of domain theory, including developments in universal algebra and category theory in the 1960s and 1970s. One of the key contributions to domain theory came from the work of Scott, whose inspiration for denotational semantics sparked rapid development in the field. The utility of domain theory across various areas was tied to its optimal coding of approximation via the way-below relation and the notion of a continuous domain.

Furthermore, the paper refers to a 1998 philosophical paper by Th. Mormann that demonstrates the use of domain theory concepts in addressing a problem within the Whiteheadian theory of regions, highlighting domain theory's ability to intersect with philosophy.

The paper also discusses the application of domain theory in set-valued analysis and suggests idempotent analysis as another promising area for its application. For readers interested in learning more, it recommends specific literature on these topics.

Lastly, the paper addresses abstract Cuntz semigroups within domain theory, noting that preservation of the way-below relation has been a focus in relation to adjoints and suggesting that this preservation is analogous to the statement that a certain function is an open map based on Scott topology notions.
