Ullah et al. (2017) conducted a comprehensive review of the multifaceted challenges in agriculture and explored the array of precision agriculture techniques underpinned by artificial intelligence and machine learning, along with envisaging future advancements in the field. Their survey highlighted tools such as GPS/GNSS, mobile tech, robotics, autonomous tractors, irrigation systems, drones, IoT, sensors, variable rate seeding, and weather prediction models as pivotal for refined farming practices. The authors segmented precision agriculture into four stages: data collection, data analysis, decision-making, and farming execution.

Over the past twenty years, AI innovations like Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Fuzzy Logic Controllers have emerged to optimize environmental conditions in controlled greenhouses. Khanna and Kaur (2019) further emphasized the critical backbone role of IoT in precision agriculture.

Noguchi et al. (1998) implemented Genetic Algorithm (GA)-optimized fuzzy logic to distinguish crops and weeds effectively, with ANNs aiding in estimating soybean dimensions post-weed segmentation.

Robotic technologies, equipped with grippers and vision systems, are increasingly applied for weeding and pesticide application, proving more efficient than traditional manual methods and supporting crop health assessments. Navigation systems often guide these robots, typically involving GPS and manual laptop control.

Waheed et al. (2006) explored hyperspectral remote sensing for enhanced crop management, proving its utility in monitoring nitrogen levels, weed species, pests, and vegetation parameters, with high accuracy in various factors when analyzed at early growth stages.

Decision trees coupled with ANNs or Support Vector Machines (SVMs) have shown promise for classifying hyperspectral data, as noted by Mercier and Lennon (2013).

Aqeel-ur-Rehman et al. (2014) reviewed the application of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies in agriculture, despite challenges regarding complexity and cost.

Keshtgari and Deljoo (2012) outlined the design and efficacy of field-deployed WSN systems for precision agriculture, emphasizing the importance of real-time environmental data for informed decision-making.

Patil and Kumar (2011) focused on plant disease study through image processing, advocating for automated systems to improve detection and measurement accuracy, speed, and cost-effectiveness.

Deep Convolutional Neural Networks have reached a success rate of 99.53% in plant disease identification, highlighting the accuracy of AI in this domain.

Golhani et al. (2018) and Moshou et al. (2004) reported significant advancements in plant disease detection through neural network technologies.

Dee and French (2015) proposed computer vision-based automated systems for high-throughput and precise phenotypic measurements, tackling the phenotyping bottleneck in plant breeding.

Liu et al. (2015) reviewed crop phenotyping techniques and highlighted the importance of harmonizing phenotypic and genotypic data for crop cultivar enhancement.

Lastly, Bolger et al. (2017) stressed the integration of high-throughput phenotyping with genomic data to accelerate plant breeding outcomes, along with a need for better genome annotation tools. An image processing-based detection algorithm successfully classified five key plant diseases with 92.94% accuracy, demonstrating the potential of automated disease identification.
