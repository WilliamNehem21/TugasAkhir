The paper argues that recursive data types are essential for modeling data in software verification processes. Prior efforts to create decision procedures for these types have been limited. The authors introduce a more general and flexible algorithm for the universal fragment of recursive data types. By presenting it in an abstract rule-based form, the algorithm ensures termination, soundness, and completeness, and can be used as a foundation for other, more specific algorithms.

Recursive data types are analogous to familiar data structures and are exemplified by the list data type in LISP, which uses the 'cons' constructor. To illustrate a more complex example, the paper models lists of trees of natural numbers using three recursive types: 'nat' (for natural numbers), 'list' (of tree-type elements), and 'tree'. Each type has constructors and corresponding selectors, with 'nat' for numbers, 'list' as previously defined, and 'tree' with 'node' and 'leaf' constructors.

The paper's major contributions include using a more inclusive setting allowing for multiple constructors and mutually recursive types, a novel presentation of the theory and decision procedure based on abstract rules, and the inclusion of a new strategy that enhances practical efficiency significantly. Another approach explored is first-order reasoning through the superposition calculus, which is theoretically impressive but has limitations in practice.

The paper identifies the satisfiability problem of literals as NP-complete, aligning with other NP-complete issues such as boolean satisfiability. Strategies play a crucial role in practical efficiency. The authors propose improvements to the greedy splitting strategy, recommending more sophisticated rules that should be applied as late as possible, termed the 'lazy splitting strategy'. This approach aims to reduce unnecessary case splits and, in some situations, avoid splitting altogether, thus optimizing the efficiency of the decision mechanism.
