The presented paper details the creation of a sophisticated simulation that mimics the workings of a smart grid at the local neighborhood level. Such a smart grid is capable of monitoring and directing the flow of electrical power in multiple directions, adapting its behavior based on factors like time of day, climatic conditions, and fluctuating electricity costs. Due to the intricate nature of smart grid control mechanisms, the authors argue these need thorough simulation-based analyses before real-world application to guarantee their reliability under varying conditions.

To underpin the study, the authors crafted a comprehensive simulation model encapsulating elements such as consumer demand, centralized and decentralized power generation, and storage units. The detailed model represents a network of homes, each potentially equipped with solar arrays, storage batteries, and distinct power usage profiles, allowing for analysis of power dynamics within and between homes. This modularly structured simulation can be conveniently augmented to integrate additional devices and scenarios.

The modeling employs AnyLogic software, leveraging its support for system dynamics, agent-based, and discrete event simulation techniques, using Java-based code and graphical components. Within the model, system dynamics illustrate energy flows, while an agent-based method allows individual components to interact and exchange data.

The paper is organized into several sections, reviewing model component functions, simulation results for selected scenarios, related work in the field, and concluding remarks.

The demand module sets power consumption profiles for houses, which could be generic or personalized via smart meter data. For the production of renewable energy, the weather module inputs, currently limited to solar irradiation data but extendable to wind data, are factored in. The model draws on data from the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute for weather conditions relevant to the Netherlands, such as global horizontal irradiance, which impacts solar energy production.

Moreover, energy-use implications at the level of individual households, exemplified by a family home, can be analyzed within the same simulation run.

One featured application is the smart energy city concept. It highlights a model's benefits like reduced energy consumption through demand response and load control strategies, validated by using AnyLogic software.

The smart grid simulation tool not only simulates homes with solar and storage solutions but also integrates meteorological statistics to realistically model solar power generation. These elements combined offer extensive data on financial and energy exchanges, proving beneficial for consumers and researchers alike.

Developed with the versatile AnyLogic software, the model utilizes system dynamics and agent-based approaches for scalability and rich neighborhood simulations. The current model remains open-ended, with room for expansion to include electric vehicles as storage or other renewable energy sources. It's also geared to test various algorithms, which might manage power trading activities or battery utilization strategies based on market conditions.
