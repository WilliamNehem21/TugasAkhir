The paper discusses the application of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for predicting the performance of hybrid nano-lubricants. The ANN model was compared to other data processing techniques such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Partial Least Squares (PLS), and Principal Component Regression, and the results indicated a strong alignment between the ANN predictions and actual experimental data.

In the context of the lubricant industry, which is crucial for machinery and related industries, the paper highlights the advantages of using improved lubricants. These benefits include reducing friction and wear, providing cooling, and preventing the diffusion of gases and particulate matter, which ultimately contribute to the extended lifespan of machinery components.

The paper also reviews the incorporation of nanoparticles into fluids to create nanofluids, enhancing their properties over base fluids. Experimental studies are cited, indicating the impact of solid volume fraction (SVF) and temperature on the viscosity and thermal conductivity of nanofluids.

To predict the lubricating properties of a specific hybrid nano-lubricant composed of MWCNT-Al2O3 particles dispersed in oil 5W50, a multi-layer ANN with a back propagation learning algorithm was utilized. The back propagation algorithm helps adjust the weights of the neural network through a learning process to better connect inputs to accurate outputs. A considerable amount of data from the literature was used to train and validate the ANN model.

Results from the ANN model displayed good predictive accuracy when compared to experimental data, suggesting that the model can reliably predict these properties. To offer a broader perspective on data analysis techniques, the paper briefly discusses PLS regression, describing it as a fast and efficient method that manages co-linear explanatory variables, contrasting it with principal component regression (PCR).

The work cited, referenced as Shariati et al. (2019), also demonstrates the use of an ANN combined with Particle Swarm Optimization (ANN-PSO) to predict the behavior of channel shear connectors in normal and high-strength concrete, exemplifying the versatility and effectiveness of ANN models in predicting complex behaviors in materials science.
