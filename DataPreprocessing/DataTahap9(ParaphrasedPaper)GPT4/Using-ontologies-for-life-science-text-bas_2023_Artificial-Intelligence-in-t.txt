The academic paper discusses the use of ontologies to manage and access various databases across multiple fields, emphasizing the diverse domains of the life sciences (LS). Ontologies serve to define hierarchical concepts and bridge the gaps between heterogeneous databases with different semantics through structured texts and descriptions. Key areas included in LS-related ontologies are molecular biology, bioinformatics, physics, chemistry, medicine, among other related disciplines.

The ontology infrastructure comprises tools like AGBase, which uses the Gene Ontology (GO) to correct errors in gene product annotations, and GOPubMed, which employs GO to organize millions of PubMed articles. Additionally, open biomedical ontologies (OBO), such as the Cell Ontology or species-specific anatomies like Uberon, facilitate cross-species comparative studies. These ontologies collectively enhance the capability of specialists to review and update information in fields such as anatomy, health, biochemistry, and phenotype.

OntoEdit (formerly AMIGO) was an early ontology building tool, succeeded by the NEON Toolkit, offering design pattern-based processes, though its relevance appears to be diminishing. Biologists utilize OBO-Edit, while VocBench and Fluent Editor are examples of ontology editors still in use. The W3C-endorsed Swoop lacks a project website, yet was an accessible and simple editor.

Graphical tools within the ontology editors allow for listing individuals included in the ontology, examining annotations, checking distinct or similar individuals, and asserting property relationships. OWLDoc offers a dynamic view and export functionality to share ontology details through static HTML pages.

Swoop, an OWL ontology browser and editor developed at the University of Maryland, features web browser-like navigation and allows for detailed work on ontological entities within its interface. It provides validation, information panels, and several display options for entities within an ontology.

Ontology renderer plugins specialize in interpreting ontologies, reading logic expressiveness, entity counts, and identifying logic structures. The Annotea framework offers tools for separating ontology annotations from the core, using extendable RDF vocabularies, and publishing them on Annotea group servers.

The paper suggests future research directions could focus on automating ontology creation and exploring ontology evolution and mapping due to the significance of the creation cost, abstraction, and reusability. Core ontologies could be adapted into specialized types to cater to specific applications, potentially enhancing understanding and communication in experimental studies and the broader LS experimentation domain.
