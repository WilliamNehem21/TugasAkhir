The structure of the article is outlined as follows: Section II introduces the methods for characterizing cryogenic devices as well as the newly established CMOS model calibrated for 4 K applications implemented in circuit design. Section III discusses the design and architecture of the clock generator, including considerations needed for cryogenic circuit operation. Test results of the clock generator at standard room temperature (300 K) and cryogenic temperature (4 K) are detailed in Section IV. The paper is wrapped up with a conclusion in Section V.

The paper also acknowledges that certain effects such as quantum transport, source-to-drain tunneling, and other phenomena were not incorporated in the current model. Additionally, aspects such as Monte-Carlo parameters, parasitic capacitances, self-heating effects, device mismatch parameters, and the small-signal model of cryo-MOSFETs require further investigation. These elements are slated for exploration in future phases of the research team's efforts on cryo-CMOS modeling.
