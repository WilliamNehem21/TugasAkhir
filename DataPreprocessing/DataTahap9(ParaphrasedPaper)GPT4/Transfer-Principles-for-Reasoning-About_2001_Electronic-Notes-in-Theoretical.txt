Regarding the interpretation of semantics, this study analyzes conditional atomic actions that treat "await B then A" as atomic operations. For coarse-grained trace semantics, marked as Tcoarse, both assignment operations and evaluations of boolean expressions are considered atomic. On the other hand, fine-grained semantics, or Tfine, only treat reads and writes to individual variables as atomic actions. When discussing results that apply to both semantics in the remainder of this paper, T may be used to refer to either coarse or fine-grained trace semantics.

In this context, it's essential to track the number of references made to each identifier within the program, focusing particularly on non-atomic sub-expressions since their execution could be influenced by concurrent processes.

The study then aims to establish a definition for the read multiset of an expression by examining several representative cases. Notably, when considering expressions like E1 + E2, which are constructed using binary operators, an additive approach to multiset union is employed to accurately reflect the frequency of reads required when evaluating an expression.
