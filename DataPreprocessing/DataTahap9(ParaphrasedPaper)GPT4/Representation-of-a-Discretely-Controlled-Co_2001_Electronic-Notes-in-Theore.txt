In this study, we expand on an existing theoretical framework to encompass continuous systems. We include continuous variables and their first and second derivatives to evaluate programs that manage physical or other systems in a discrete yet continuous manner.

Section 2 presents the formal structure and meaning of timed automata (TA), building upon the groundwork laid out in prior research. Following this, in Section 3, we examine a vehicle control system. We use the scenario where a car is merging into traffic at a T-junction as our case study. We aim to precisely define the merging process and conduct a thorough verification to ensure the conditions are met for a safe merge without collisions.
