The study presents a theoretical framework using structural induction for the initial Bounded Context-Free (BCF) framework. The primary focus is on evaluating a specific case involving the application of a term `(x:e1)@e2`. The analysis demonstrates that monotonicity is preserved for bound and free (but non-capturing) variables when applying 9-related Kripke resource semantics (KP Res). The BCF condition is emphasized to ensure that modifications to `e1` will not prevent a reduction step (redex) due to the inclusion of capturing variables in the set of bound variables. While it is possible to exclude 2-rule in deriving the results, doing so would greatly complicate the proof of Lemma 3.4 since it would disrupt the simplicity of transitive and reflexive induction.

The paper introduces the Strong Finite Developments Property (SFDP) without relying on finite developments to demonstrate typical confluence. This proof technique is considered less complex, combining elements from Tait/Martin-Löf/Takahashi methods and the standard SFDP. It uses additional auxiliary lemmas, which might extend the length of the proof.

The authors encourage readers interested in a detailed, mechanic analysis of residual theory in the λ-calculus represented with de Bruijn terms to refer to their defined resource. This treatment of residual theory aims at a categorical approach, comparing the robustness of Huet’s results with original Tait/Martin-Löf confluence proofs and subsequent adaptations by Takahashi.

To maintain clarity, the paper retains 'e' as a meta-variable for well-formed terms while occasionally using 'm' and 'n' for raw terms. Additionally, the paper distinguishes between raw and real relations by using different types of arrows.

Original justification for considering residuals lies in the finiteness of developments in contrast to unrestricted lambda-reduction, proven finite by previous studies. The paper utilizes Newman's Lemma, asserting that by demonstrating weak confluence in developments, one can indirectly prove the confluence of the entire λ-calculus. 

The proof confirms the "dev-relation" as evidence for quantification described in Lemma 5.1, supported by findings in Lemma 5.3 and Proposition 5.5. The secondary outcome leverages these conclusions, adapting Lemma 4.4 by Lemma 2.3.2.

The paper also gives a brief overview of diagrammatic reasoning in the context of the m-calculus—a calculus more expressive than the λ-calculus—which allows for the simulation of a broader range of computational paradigms, including mutual recursive binding among sets of elements. Both the λ-calculus and m-calculus results are framed uniformly for consistency in their presentation.
