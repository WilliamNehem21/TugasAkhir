This paper addresses the challenge of multi-constrained Quality of Service (QoS) routing, which involves finding network paths that meet various QoS criteria simultaneously. It introduces a protocol called Fuzzy Cost Based Multi-Constrained Quality of Service Routing (FCMQR). FCMQR aims to identify an optimal network path using a range of independent QoS metrics, such as bandwidth, end-to-end delay, and hop count, utilizing a multi-criterion objective based on fuzzy logic. The proposed method transforms all available path resources into a singular metric known as fuzzy cost, and it incorporates mobility predictions to estimate the path's durability, termed lifetime. The path featuring the longest lifetime and lowest fuzzy cost is selected for data transmission. Simulation outcomes suggest that FCMQR effectively predicts and evaluates the stability and cost of QoS routing in dynamic, mobile networks.

The paper also discusses the challenges of maintaining group membership functions and constructing an optimal multicast tree in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), emphasizing that QoS guarantees are critical for multicast services' efficacy, particularly under challenging conditions. QoS routing poses difficulties in MANETs due to frequent topology changes caused by node mobility and the dynamic nature of state information used for routing. It notes that most existing QoS-aware routing protocols for MANETs consider only one or two metrics, which is inadequate due to the influence of several interconnected factors like link stability, node mobility, and device battery life.

Following the introduction, Section 2 reviews relevant literature, while Sections 3 and 4 outline the design of the selection parameters and the fuzzy logic inference engine, respectively. Section 5 details the mobility prediction mechanism, and Section 6 focuses on predicting the cost-effective lifetime of a path. Section 7 elaborates on the route discovery process of the proposed FCMQR protocol. The paper then presents and discusses simulation results in Section 8 and concludes in Section 9.
