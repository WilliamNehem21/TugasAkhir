Concurrent data structures allow multiple operations by different processes to occur simultaneously. Demonstrating the validity of these implementations requires establishing that the outcomes remain correct under every potential combination of atomic operations. Linearizability is the primary standard for verifying such concurrent structures. However, this concept is not commonly applied in formal correctness proofs.

The connection between a history (h) and a sequence (s) of operations can be clarified by marking specific linearization points in h. These points indicate when an operation occurs—a linearization point named x.do opp(args) comes after its start and before its corresponding response. By adding these points to history h, creating an updated history h', a linearization of h can be formed, reflecting the correct sequential order of operations.

Consider a scenario with multiple operations by different processes, some potentially incomplete. Various linearizations are possible by choosing whether to leave operations incomplete or resolving their outcomes, followed by ordering the remaining operations in a way that adheres to the stack’s rules.

Every possible legal interleaving of actions from various processes respecting the stack specifications can be produced by the stack's implementation of an Input/Output Automaton (IOA). The designed IOA ensures the creation of linearizable histories specific to a data structure, which has been explained in detail in another section.

Specifically discussing stack operations, a push creates a new node and attempts to link it into a stack by first taking a snapshot of the current top (head), connecting it to the new node, and then updating head. A successful compare-and-swap (CAS) operation ensures that head has not changed and, if so, updates it to the new node. If head has changed, the operation restarts.

A pop operation, on the other hand, takes a similar snapshot and tries to update head to the next node. A successful pop must ensure that the memory of the popped node isn't immediately freed, as it could be accessed concurrently by other processes. To claim such an implementation as lock-free, one must consider a lock-free garbage collection system or other memory recycling methods like version numbers to handle storage reclamation.

The paper also expresses an interest in simplifying proofs via constructive strategies, potentially by identifying commonalities in developing nonblocking algorithms. Exploring different frameworks, such as action systems or the Event-B method by Abrial and Cansell, could facilitate this streamlining process.
