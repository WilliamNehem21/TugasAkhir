Desalination is increasingly crucial for water supply, particularly in Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia. This paper discusses the significance of integrating renewable energy sources into desalination plants to ensure their sustainability. The authors advocate for a shift from traditional process controls to cyber-physical systems (CPS), emphasizing the role of the Internet of Things (IoT) in controlling and monitoring renewable energy-powered desalination plants.

The research presents a model of a desalination plant driven by hybrid wind and solar energy, executed within an IoT framework using Cisco's Packet Tracer network simulation tool. The plant incorporates renewable energy to operate pumps, with automatic motor controls reacting to water demands and levels, and a boiler regulated by a thermostat. Additionally, a web-based monitoring system with varying access permissions for employees is established for oversight.

The paper observes that despite the abundance of wind and solar resources, Gulf countries have been slow to adopt renewable energy for desalination, though Saudi Arabia has made recent progress. Extensive literature exists on using renewables for desalination, including economic, engineering, and physical analyses. However, the IoT perspective remains underexplored, which is crucial as renewables are integral to smart grids and CPS.

The paper is structured as follows: a literature review of renewable energy in desalination, an explanation of the IoT-based implementation of a hybrid wind-solar plant, presentation of results, and concluding remarks. Case studies and economic analyses highlight the cost-effectiveness and significance of location and crop selection for renewable-powered desalination. Innovative models combining desalination and renewable energy demonstrate potential cost reductions and optimal resource supply.

The study also references a recent proposal for a large-scale hybrid wind-solar plant in Saudi Arabia, planned to sustain a 1kW load continuously at a competitive cost. The current research focuses on a smaller scale plant with aspirations for expansion, emphasizing the IoT aspect over mechanical and electrical concerns for the time being.
