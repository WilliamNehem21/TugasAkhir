The paper explores a new methodology to verify software functionality, particularly in the context of ensuring that software behaves as expected in response to certain events within synchronous systems. This methodology makes use of an automated testing tool proficient in executing tests that align with statistical forecasts. Key insights come from validating a telephone system, with a special focus on spotting feature interactions.

The structure of the paper is as follows: Section 2 introduces the context of the case study. Section 3 describes the proposed strategy for testing eventuality properties. Section 4 elaborates on the testing tool, Lutess, and its customization for checking against eventuality properties. Section 5 summarizes the outcomes of the case study, and Section 6 provides concluding remarks.

The paper presents an example involving two telephone subscribers using different features, illustrating how their interactions are tested. It is emphasized that the verification of any temporal property must rely on the observable behavior of a program, represented by execution traces. Traditional functional testing is aimed more at error detection than at proving system correctness.

The method used for statistical generation of input data, and prioritization of data that could lead the system into error states, is highlighted. However, this method has limitations in complex environments because it may not accurately reflect realistic user behavior.

The researchers are also examining whether the distribution of elapsed time for a particular feature, Call Completion on Busy Subscriber (CCBS), follows a recognized statistical distribution, which could improve the accuracy of the confidence index used in testing. This index could also serve as a threshold to decide when to halt testing, for instance, if the confidence of uncovering an error drops below a certain percentage.

Lastly, the paper mentions the 1999 ERCIM Workshop on Formal Methods for Industrial Critical Systems, referencing a previous work that involved using the programming language Esterel and formal methods to improve confidence in functional validation of commercial digital signal processors (DSPs). The paper also briefly describes the user events and system outputs for the telephone system under study.
