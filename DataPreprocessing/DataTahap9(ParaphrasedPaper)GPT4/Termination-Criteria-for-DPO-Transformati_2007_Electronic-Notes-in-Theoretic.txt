Recent advancements have confirmed how graph and model transformation systems can be terminated, with some transformation tools now equipped to assess these termination criteria. This issue emerges from using graph transformations to either build a model from the ground up or modify existing ones, with the goal of completing output models in a finite number of steps. 

A definition for the termination of graph transformation systems is offered, expanding on earlier definitions and adding the ability to manage various control structures.

The paper limits its discussion to "e-concurrent productions" and a concurrency theorem that does not yet accommodate productions with application conditions, focusing on plain productions.

To demonstrate the practicality of suggested termination criteria, two case studies are presented, examining transformation idioms and their termination behaviors. The termination analysis uses new techniques in practical software model transformations, considering strict control flow structures supported by tools.

The "leaf collector" pattern, sourced from transforming hierarchical to flat data flow diagrams, is an example of an idiom for identifying leaf elements in a tree without modifying the original graph. It has specific termination properties that ensure the application of subsequent rules.

For the leaf collector idiom, termination is ensured if the input graph lacks directed cycles. In practice, model transformation systems often prevent directed cycles either through containment hierarchies or because such cycles can cause semantic issues.

If no inherent constraints prevent cycles, the leaf collector can be modified to avoid nontermination, such as by marking nodes as processed or using helper edges with negative application conditions to prevent reprocessing the same node.

Separate termination criteria developed for graph rewriting in program transformations are mentioned, which consider edge-accumulative rules and assume finite labels and nodes. Similarly, subtractive rules and deletion layers have been explored, albeit these criteria consider more restricted rules than those discussed in this academic paper.

An abstract termination criterion based on a measure function and concrete criteria like node and edge count are developed using the DPO (double-pushout) approach. However, the relationship between these criteria and the actual cessation of a transformation within finite steps is not explicitly connected in the second case study.
