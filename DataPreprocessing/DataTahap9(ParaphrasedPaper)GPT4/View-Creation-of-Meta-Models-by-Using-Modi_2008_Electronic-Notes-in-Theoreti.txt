This paper discusses VTGGs (View-based Triple Graph Grammars) and is structured as follows:

Section 2 introduces an example of two intertwined meta models, where one serves as a view of the other.

Section 3 reviews existing literature on the development of database views.

Section 4 presents VTGGs, a variant of TGGs (Triple Graph Grammars) tailored for defining views.

Section 5 concludes the paper, touches on unresolved challenges, and suggests directions for future research. It also notes that detailed explanations on converting VTGG rules into view implementation rules are excluded due to space constraints.

A sub-section describes the initial VTGG rule used for matching an empty axiom graph to generate the top-level object of the base model and its view. This involves applying a TGG rule to a pair of associated model graphs by identifying matches for all unmarked elements of the rule. Initially, when creating a model and its view, there are no objects present that can be matched by any patterns.
