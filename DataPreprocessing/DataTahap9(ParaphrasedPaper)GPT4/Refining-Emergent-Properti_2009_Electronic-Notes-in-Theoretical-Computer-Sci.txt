The paper discusses how the continual reduction in the size and cost of microprocessors and storage devices is spurring the creation of systems that are more distributed and decentralized. These systems function with components that rely mostly on local interactions for information, rather than having access to a comprehensive global view. This reliance on local information can lead to the expression of emergent behavior, where the overall system behavior is not simply the sum of its individual parts acting alone.

Despite their potential, there is some hesitation to use formal methods in designing these systems, partly due to the challenges associated with complex systems which include both natural and artificial ones, such as the internet. Traditional research focuses on modeling these systems to predict overall behavior, but this can be limited by unexpected changes in behavior that are not accounted for in models, possibly missing emergent phenomena. Moreover, it's argued that some complex systems may display strong emergence, making it impossible to develop proofs that accurately describe how their behaviors arise.

The paper also discusses cellular automata like the Game of Life, which can produce various patterns, including ones that move like the 'glider'. Polack and Stepney have suggested that specifying the movement of a glider is incompatible with the rules of the Game of Life because when emergence occurs, the specification and its implementation must be inherently different.

To illustrate their methodology, the authors provide an example of specifying and refining dynamic patterns including a glider in a simplified one-dimensional version of the Game of Life. They also show this process in the full two-dimensional variant to demonstrate that the refinement approach holds, without confusing different abstraction levels.

The behavior of systems is specified using time, but implementations make use of cellular automata updated by transition rules to capture temporal behaviors. This notational approach guides the refinement from behavior specification to implementation.

Extending these concepts to other systems with emergent behavior, the authors note that Generalized Cellular Automata (GCA) can model more complex agent systems. While the current approach could adapt to GCA, it's also suggested to draw upon experiences and formal techniques used in systolic algorithmsâ€”platforms optimized for data flow and timing which might similarly address the temporal behavior of GCA systems.
