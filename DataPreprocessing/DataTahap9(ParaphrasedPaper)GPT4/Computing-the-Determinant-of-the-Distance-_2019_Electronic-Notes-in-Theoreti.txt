The academic paper states two lemmas about certain properties of graph determinants.

Lemma 2.1: Consider a graph G. When a new pendant vertex is added to any vertex of G, creating a new graph H, the determinant of the distance matrix (D(H)) remains unchanged, no matter which vertex of the original graph G is chosen for the addition of the pendant vertex.

Lemma 2.2: Let G1 and G2 be two disconnected components of a graph with vertices labeled {v1, v2, ..., vk} for G1 and {vk+1, vk+2, ..., vn} for G2. Create a new graph G by connecting vertex v1 from G1 and vertex vn from G2 with an edge. Next, form another graph H by merging vertices v1 and vn into a single vertex (thus identifying them) and then attaching a new pendant vertex to this merged vertex (v1/vn). The determinant of the distance matrix of graph G (det(D(G))) is equal to the determinant of the distance matrix of graph H (det(D(H))).
