The field of security sciences increasingly relies on biometric technologies to manage access to restricted areas, a significant challenge within the domain of security. Traditional identification methods, like keys or passwords, are proving insufficient for many applications due to their vulnerabilities; they can be forgotten, stolen, or compromised. Consequently, there is a shift towards developing automatic identification systems.

The iris recognition system (IRS) is highlighted as a highly accurate and reliable biometric technique extensively explored and implemented in security applications. Countries have adopted IRS to bolster security measures in areas such as airports and government facilities. Although research into iris recognition began earlier, many of the significant advancements in the field draw inspiration from the work of John Daugman.

Daugman's work focuses on the segmentation of the iris and involves isolating the iris region from an image. His process includes normalizing the iris to a consistent size and shape, transforming the iris from a circular shape into a standard rectangular block. This is despite the fact that the two circular boundaries of the iris are not concentric. Daugman's use of the integro-differential operator to detect these boundaries is particularly noteworthy.

In this paper, the authors introduce a new method for extracting features from the iris, enhancing the Local Binary Pattern (LBP) technique to better capture the local characteristics and details of iris texture. The structure of the paper is as follows: the new iris texture analysis method is outlined in Section 2, Section 3 presents experimental results, and the final conclusions are summarized in Section 4.

The experimental results show that the improved method, named the Novel Binary Pattern (NBP), outperforms the traditional LBP, achieving a 76.25% success rate compared to LBP's 58.75%. Unlike LBP, which compares neighbors to the central pixel intensity, NBP focuses on the relationships between neighboring pixels, highlighting the importance of capturing dynamics within local areas. These findings confirm the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed NBP method in achieving superior feature extraction for iris recognition.
