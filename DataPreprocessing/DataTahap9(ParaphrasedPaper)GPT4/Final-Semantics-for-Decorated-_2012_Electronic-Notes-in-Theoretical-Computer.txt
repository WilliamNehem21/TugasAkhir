The same concept of making systems deterministic has been explored earlier too but in a different contextâ€”specifically, for testing semantics, where 'must testing' aligns with failure semantics when there are no infinite computations. An effort was made to describe the range of possible behaviors in a coalgebraic framework, though this was done in a provisional manner. The relationship between these approaches is an area for further investigation.

There are two key areas for future research. First, we are interested in examining how coalgebraic methods for analyzing trace semantics with additional information can be adapted for use with probabilistic systems. Second, we want to find out how we could integrate our methodology with others to develop a coinductive strategy for defining denotational (linear-time) semantics for various process calculi.
