This academic paper addresses the problem of finding the largest approximately planar region on a terrain. This is translated into a computational geometric problem, where the goal is to find a weighted connected subgraph within a spherical disk of a fixed radius on the unit sphere. The authors propose an algorithm that accomplishes this in \(O(n^2 \log n (\log \log n)^3)\) time, with n representing the number of vertices in the graph or, correspondingly, the number of terrain facets.

Referring to previous work by Lee, who solved a related problem in \(O(n^2)\) time, and work by Agarwal et al., who also provided alternative algorithms for optimal disk placement with approximations near-linear in time, the authors build upon these findings. They present an algorithm under specific assumptions to avoid degenerate cases, such as no two spherical disks touching at a single point or intersecting at exactly one point.

The paper walks through the algorithmic steps and improvements leading to significant running time reduction. The method involves traversing an arrangement of points, maintaining a data structure that efficiently updates and queries the connected components of the graph as the spherical disk moves over the arrangement.

Although the authors demonstrate the tractability of the problem with quadratic complexity, they suggest it is unlikely to be solved faster based on related computational complexity evidence. Furthermore, they hypothesize that even approximating the largest planar region in subquadratic time is challenging, leaving the formal proof of both claims as open problems for future research. The paper also mentions a web-based implementation of a heuristic for computing large approximately planar regions in terrain data, using examples from metal fracture surfaces obtained through confocal laser scanning microscopy.
