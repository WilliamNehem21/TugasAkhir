This academic paper discusses the application of deep neural networks (DNNs) to optimization and control problems, which have been explored across various sectors such as education, media, power, and healthcare. It recognizes that there are certain problems within these fields for which no analytical solutions exist and that even problems with known analytical solutions may have assumed constants, which do not account for variability.

The paper then references the use of Python as a programming language, noting its extensive library of packages for different applications and suitability for developing large, structured programs. However, it points out that Python, being an interpreted language, is not ideal for long-running computational tasks. To address this, Python often relies on precompiled library routines, which can be accessed directly using libraries such as PyTorch.

Furthermore, the paper mentions the need for specific boundary conditions in the context of physical simulations, such as walls, inflows, and outflows. In temporal simulations, for instance, the initial state acts as a Dirichlet boundary condition. Techniques like the finite difference or finite elements methods are commonly used in these simulations, where the computational domain is divided into smaller regions for solution estimation, which are then combined to obtain a global solution.

In particular, the paper examines physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and how they handle discontinuities and boundary conditions in partial differential equations (PDEs). It observes that PINNs can resolve discontinuities more sharply than conventional methods, albeit sometimes adding oscillations; however, this tends to result in an overall reduction in error. To test the effectiveness of PINNs, the authors plot the error ratio against discontinuity width and demonstrate that larger discontinuities correlate with lower error ratios. They note an anomaly with other methods such as Lax-Friedrichs, forward-time backward-space (FTBS), and Lax-Wendroff, wherein an anomalous oscillation is observed, which PINNs seem to handle better.
