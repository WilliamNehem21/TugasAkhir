Taking into account these features, a variety of optimization challenges can be addressed with this decentralized approach. Nonetheless, similar to numerous heuristic strategies, the efficiency in reaching the most stable solutions diminishes when the scale of the problem increases. This issue of reduced convergence speed is particularly noted as a drawback in more traditional methods like Simulated Annealing (SA), as mentioned in prior studies [5,6].
