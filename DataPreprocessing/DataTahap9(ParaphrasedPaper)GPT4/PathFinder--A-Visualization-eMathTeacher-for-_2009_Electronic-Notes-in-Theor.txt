The necessity to find innovative strategies for fostering student engagement in active learning led us to create a new type of web-based educational tools. Our primary aim is to encourage student participation to the fullest extent in their learning journey. To achieve this, we've been crafting a series of interactive Java applets that enable students to see algorithms in action. These applets adhere to the eMathTeacher framework and are utilized to supplement blended learningâ€”supporting instructors in classroom settings and aiding students in their independent studies. Blending traditional face-to-face instruction with the technological conveniences of e-learning, these tools make students the center of their educational advancement.

The specialized eLearning tools we've developed, which conform to the eMathTeacher standards, are unique in that they execute a step only if the input is correct; otherwise, they return a customized error message along with a hint to guide the student toward the right answer. This approach is particularly beneficial for novice students with little to no background in algorithms, data structures, and programming. Our tools are designed to help them grasp the essence of an algorithm and understand its operational mechanics, such as executing an if-then statement. Unlike other platforms, the interactive functionalities of our eMathTeacher-compliant tools set them apart, making them a powerful resource for interactive learning.

Our latest tool, Pathfinder, has just been completed and has yet to be used by students. Consequently, there is no data on its impact yet. However, based on our previous studies, we are optimistic about its potential to enhance learning. Prior research has included an assessment of the impact of earlier graph-based eMathTeacher tools by analyzing performance on graph exercises in a discrete mathematics exam. The findings, as we reported, indicated that the students who used our tools gained a better understanding of algorithmic processes, even though those tools did not include features like the algorithm visualization panel or the framework panel.
