In this section, we summarize our primary contribution, which is a comprehensive adaptation of the first two points from Pour-El and Richards' second key theorem. Additionally, we deduce some supplementary findings from our main result. The elaboration of the main result is postponed to later sections as it requires certain technical groundwork.

We have previously verified this outcome for standard operators in real Hilbert spaces, as discussed in our earlier work. However, that verification provided us only with insights into the spectrum. The current result advances our understanding by offering insights into the eigenvalues of self-adjoint operators within complex Hilbert spaces.

Despite these advancements, various compelling questions about the computability of spectra for linear operators persist. Pour-El and Richards also tackled a reformulation of their second key theorem for both bounded normal operators and unbounded closed self-adjoint operators. Our assertions extend not just to normal operators on complex Hilbert spaces but also to self-adjoint operators on real Hilbert spaces and normal operators within complex contexts. Whether a comprehensive version of Pour-El and Richards' results concerning normal and unbounded operators is provable—meaning, whether it is feasible to deduce information regarding eigenvalues from a program representing the operator in these scenarios—remains an unresolved issue.
