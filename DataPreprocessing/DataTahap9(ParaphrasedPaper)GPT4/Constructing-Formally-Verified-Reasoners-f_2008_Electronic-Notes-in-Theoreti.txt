In the field of the Semantic Web, reasoners based on Description Logics (DLs) like Racer, Pellet, and FaCT++ are utilized to handle information. Description Logics are a group of formalisms used to represent detailed knowledge about concepts and terms. ALC logic is a foundational logic in this family, which can be expanded into the more sophisticated SHOIN logic corresponding to the Ontology Web Language (OWL).

Ensuring the correctness of these DL reasoners through formal verification could significantly enhance their dependability, and consequently, the reliability of the Semantic Web as a whole. However, this formal verification is both time-intensive and resource-heavy. Additionally, verifying multiple reasoners could lead to repetition of efforts, as similar problems would have to be solved for each reasoner.

The algorithm described in the paper is flexible, in that the specific strategy for applying completion rules is not predefined. Instead, this strategy relies on a selection function, with the algorithm's correctness being proven under certain assumptions about this function.

To support formal specifications and proofs, a tool named PVS offers a foundational prelude and libraries that contain standard specifications and proven facts across various theories. PVS allows for theory packaging, where definitions and theorems can be reused by importing them into new theories.

The paper outlines how PVS is used for type and operator refinement, which is essential for relating different specifications of the same concept. This is important because proofs about program properties depend heavily on the data types and their implementations. By verifying properties for a generic program specification, those verified properties can then be applied to specific instances of the program.

The construction of a generic algorithm is discussed, which adheres to the specifications of a predefined generic framework. The goal is to ensure the derived algorithm inherits the termination, soundness, and completeness of the framework using refinement methodologies.

Additionally, the paper emphasizes that deciding whether a rule is applicable depends not only on an instance axiom but also requires an activationâ€”a combination of an instance axiom and a witness. The type 'activation' from the generic framework is refined, and a function is specified for computing the outcomes of rule applications.

Finally, the function 'f(l)' is described, which selects an applicable activation for an ABox 'l', guiding the completion process's next step. Because of type constraints, 'f(l)' returns a list of activations, with an empty list signifying the absence of applicable activations to 'l'.
