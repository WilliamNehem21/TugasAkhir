This research paper addresses the challenges involved in solving many-objective optimization problems, where the increasing number of objectives significantly complicates the balancing act between convergence toward optimal solutions and maintaining diversity among solutions. To tackle these complexities, the authors propose a novel algorithm inspired by three-way decision (TWD) theory, which is a decision-making model based on rough set theory and seeks to more closely emulate human cognitive processes.

In this approach, the algorithm measures convergence by how close an individual solution is to an ideal point and measures diversity by the minimum distance to other solutions. Consequently, it applies a three-tiered decision process: accepting individuals with both good convergence and diversity, outright rejecting those with poor scores in both criteria, and deferring decisions for those with a good score in one criterion but not the other.

The authors introduce a dynamic threshold method to enhance algorithm performance in decision-making. They compare this new TWD-based optimization algorithm against established algorithms across various test scenarios, demonstrating its improved ability to balance convergence and diversity.

Existing algorithms like GREP, RVEA, MAOEA/D, EFRRR, and NSGA-III feature various selection strategies to address convergence and diversity, including grid sorting and non-dominated sorting. The authors note that as the number of iterations increases, the traditional reference point strategies used by these algorithms can result in an imbalance between convergence and diversity.

The authors' TWD-based algorithm overcomes these shortcomings and is tested against a suite of benchmark problems, including the DTLZ and WFG test sets with different objective numbers (m=4, 6, 8, 10, 15), comprising 65 test cases. The experimental results show that the new algorithm outperforms classical methods and effectively balances the two crucial aspects of the optimization problemâ€”convergence and diversity of solutions.

In conclusion, the paper suggests that the algorithm based on three-way decision theory (MAOEA-TWD) presents a feasible and effective strategy for addressing many-objective optimization challenges.
