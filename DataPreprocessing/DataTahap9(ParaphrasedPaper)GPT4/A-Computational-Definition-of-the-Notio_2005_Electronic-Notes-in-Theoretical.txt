An algebra is typically identified by a set with specific operations and axioms it must satisfy. However, it is possible to substitute these axioms with a computational algorithm that operates on terms formed from these operations, which the algebra must adhere to. The paper demonstrates this for vector spaces and bilinear maps by defining a model based on a set M, an evaluation function, and n-ary functions that correspond to n-ary operations within a first-order language. A particular algebra is a model of an algorithm if it satisfies the algorithm's rewriting rules.

We need to account for the associativity and commutativity of binary operations like addition when applying reduction rules. This paper suggests transforming the axioms of field theory into rewrite systems while acknowledging the difficulty involved. Instead of looking at any field, the focus is on a specific field K defined by a terminating, ground confluent rewrite system and K-vector spaces.

A computational approach is proposed to define an algebra. This includes a set, operations, and an algorithm for terms based on these operations. An example is a K-vector space, characterized by a set E, operations such as zero, addition, and multiplication, and an algorithm R that the algebra has to conform to.
