In disaster scenarios, the swift response of air ambulances is frequently crucial for patient survival. Challenges such as remote locations and restrictions on where vehicles can land make the allocation of aerial medical resources a complex and vital task. This study uses real-life mission data to formulate an integer linear programming model that defines an optimal coverage problem. The efficiency of the model's performance was assessed using the Gurobi optimizer.

To sidestep the limitations of the local search algorithm, the study introduces solutions that incorporate base ranking alongside local and tabu search-based algorithms. The local search algorithm fell short in maximizing coverage, whereas the tabu search algorithm yielded superior, near-optimal results by minimizing total travel distance and executing faster than the Gurobi-based solution. Applying parallel CUDA processing managed to reduce computing time even further, particularly as the number of test missions grew while still keeping travel distance to a minimum.

Previous studies have offered various solutions involving near-optimal metaheuristics or focusing solely on scheduling. This research, however, aims to maximize coverage while conversely minimizing solution runtime, using real-mission data for realistic scenarios. Missions are considered to start and end at potential bases, and the goal is to identify the best base placements to optimize coverage. Algorithmic metaheuristics prove more useful than exact methods, especially when rapid vehicle repositioning is required in emergencies.

The present paper contributes a general model for optimizing emergency vehicle placement that can be adapted to diverse situations, highlighting the untapped potential of computational parallelism to speed up solution algorithms.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews related work; Section 3 discusses the problem domain, description, and constraints; Section 4 details the solutions based on base ranking, local search, and tabu search; while Sections 5 and 6 present the results and conclusions.

Apart from healthcare, other industries, such as the oil sector, can benefit from optimizing the placement of air assets. While this study focuses on minimizing total distance for vehicle placement, others have incorporated cost factors into the equation. Given that vehicle placement is considered a complex NP-hard problem, achieving an optimal solution or employing purely iterative techniques is impractical.

Real-world mission data, including factors like travel time and dispatch delay, allow for informed, trend-based optimization. Past research has used simulation and genetic algorithms to assign land-based ambulance fleets efficiently.

A mission was modeled as consisting of three parts: pickup, delivery, and return to base. To streamline calculations, the distance between pickup and delivery was not considered, as it does not affect coverage. The study assumes a base can only host one aircraft, and that spreading out the vehicles is more advantageous as missions cover a larger area.

The study designs an algorithm that accepts ranked data from a base ranking instance and then implements adjustments via a local search algorithm until no further improvements can be made.

In urban EMS systems, ambulance placement is straightforward, but air ambulance services face the challenge of fewer vehicles than bases and extensive coverage areas, making it necessary to explore alternate algorithms for optimally positioning air ambulances during disasters.
