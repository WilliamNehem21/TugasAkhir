We introduce a framework for developing and assessing global computing systems with dynamic software configurations, known as TGGA, which blends typed graph grammars with the Alloy modeling language. This framework allows for the depiction of programmed dynamic software architectures, which accommodate topology changes during runtime. We illustrate the advantages of TGGA by applying it to an automotive software system analysis.

Software architectural models elucidate a system's design through its components, interactions, and organization. For global computing systems (GCS) that can alter their structure during operation, it is crucial that the software architecture (SA) models represent and implement these changes dynamically. These models are denoted as dynamic software architectures (DSAs) and various interpretations of dynamism in SA have been presented in existing literature.

Several tools exist for designing graphs with types and attributes, amongst which AGG is notable for its comprehensive support of cardinality constraints and automatic verification. However, most tools have limitations in handling typed hypergraphs, with the exception of the Graph Exchange Language (GXL), which lacks in verification capabilities. Due to these considerations, we selected Alloy for our purpose.

The paper is outlined as follows: Section 2 details our formalized PDSA using TGGS, Section 3 discusses the Alloy implementation of TGG concepts, Section 4 explores how TGGA can be applied to design an automotive system, and Section 5 summarizes our findings and potential future research directions.

The definition includes basic concepts such as nodes and ports, and edges with a "conn" field linking ports to nodes. Using the keyword 'lone,' we specify that each port connects to at most one node. In Alloy, we define a 'graph' structure through its nodes and edges.

In Alloy, to produce graphs adhering to a specific type graph, we use the signature 'typedgraph,' which is a graph linked to a typing morphism. The target graph of this morphism represents the system's style. A type graph encompasses a suite of fundamental components—edges, nodes, ports—and their connection constraints, which form the basis for a legal typed graph. Each new system's design requires a dedicated Alloy module consisting of these components. The style for our case study is detailed in the corresponding section.
