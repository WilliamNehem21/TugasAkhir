This academic paper defines a set of valid expressions, denoted as exp(f, r), which consist of messages constructed by applying deterministic algorithms to bitstrings that could be either randomly generated or chosen by the principals involved.

The paper discusses the concept of IND-CPA (indistinguishability under chosen-plaintext attack) security for encryption, where the goal of an attacker is to determine which of two chosen messages corresponds to a given encryption, and a successful encryption algorithm should make this impractical for polynomial-time observers. The paper presents a formal theorem that captures this notion of security through probabilistic statements, highlighting that an asymmetric encryption scheme can be deemed not IND-CPA secure if an attacker can undermine its security with a single query to an encryption oracle.

An example (Example 3.7) is provided where the paper discusses how to model an attack on a 6-round version of the Data Encryption Standard (DES) using differential cryptanalysis within the paper's framework. The paper estimates that by encrypting 200 plaintext pairs, an attacker could guess 30 out of 56 key bits with a 65% probability. The paper's appendix supplies a simplified explanation, with a detailed account available in referenced literature.

The paper then goes on to discuss its contribution to bridge the gap between symbolic and computational approaches in security protocol analysis. It reviews how different research works have tackled this from various angles, including mathematical models that incorporate algebraic properties of cryptographic functions and formal models that enable probabilistic analysis of guessing attacks. Particularly, it notes efforts to computationally validate the cryptographic assumptions of the Dolev-Yao model and the development of tools like CryptoVerif for obtaining cryptographically sound security proofs.

The discussion includes a more technical point about the assumption that two algorithms (presumably q and bf) return an answer in polynomial time, which is necessary because they are run with inputs that would be impractical in an original setting.

Lastly, the paper revisits the cryptanalysis example by simplifying the consideration of a security parameter and refers the reader to the literature for a detailed description of DES and the differential cryptanalysis technique applied to it.
