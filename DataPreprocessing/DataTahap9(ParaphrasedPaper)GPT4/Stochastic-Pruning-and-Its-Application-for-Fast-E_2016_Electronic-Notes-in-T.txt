The research focuses on the management of complex oil and gas production networks that are expected to operate for extended periods, potentially involving hundreds of wells and thousands of components. Due to the extended lifespan and complexity, multiple design configurations must be analyzed quickly to optimize production.

The study introduces a model for representing the instantaneous output of the system under random operational fluctuations, indicated as qp(t) at a specific time t, where each system's performance is probabilistically reduced. The average value of instantaneous outputs from multiple such systems is determined to capture the expected operational behavior.

To calculate the expected maximum flow capacity of the production network, the sum of momentary flows from numerous randomly adjusted systems is averaged. After every simulation, the original flow capacities of any components that failed during the simulation are reset.

A notable aspect of this work is the development of an algorithm that is both simple and effective, eliminating the need for more complex discrete-event simulation to determine production availability.

Additionally, the paper outlines the user-friendly features of the accompanying software tool. This tool includes functionalities such as copy/paste for replicating parameters between different parts of the network, as well as capabilities for zooming, panning, organizing, saving, and loading of flow networks. Operators can easily modify the network by adding or removing nodes and edges to explore different topologies quickly.

The importance of the algorithm and software tool lies in their ability to swiftly compare the effectiveness of different network designs and select the one that offers the best performance. The goal is to find network configurations that maintain robust flow rates despite component failures by considering factors like redundancy, spare capacity, and others.
