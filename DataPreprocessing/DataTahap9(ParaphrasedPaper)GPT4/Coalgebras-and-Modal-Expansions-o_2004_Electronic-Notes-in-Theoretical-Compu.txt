In this paper, the authors aim to examine how classical logics can be expanded into modal logics through precise methods. They explore fully selfextensional logics (logics in which synonymous formulas always lead to the same conclusions) and define a way to expand these logics by applying a structure called the Vietoris endofunctor to the algebras that represent these logics, termed S-referential algebras.

The authors scrutinize systems with a state space characterized by a set X and an associated algebra A that comprises subsets of X. The elements of A are considered acceptable predicates or observations related to the states in X. These algebras are seen as analogous to topological spaces and can build new observations based on logical operations.

The paper's primary contribution includes a newly developed construction method for the Vietoris endofunctor on S-referential algebras, compared to traditional constructions on topological spaces like Stone or Priestley spaces. This new construction carries a logical interpretation and extends previous constructions known in the topological space domain.

A characteristic of selfextensional logics is that formulas are interchangeable if and only if they represent the same subsets across any referential algebra, providing a compositional way of equating meaning or intention. Moreover, while these logics include modal and non-modal logics (like classical and intuitionistic logics), they provide a framework that may help to understand the connections between selfextensional logics and modalities better.

Another significant aspect of the paper is the discussion on the dual relationship between the logic for atlases and S-referential algebras, emphasizing the logical significance built into their definitions. This duality extends to include other known dualities, revealing how categories of algebras and topological spaces relate in such a way as to preserve their logical content. The authors propose that embedding these dualities into the structure of referential algebras could clarify and standardize their logical interpretation.

Lastly, the paper demonstrates how the construction of the Vietoris endofunctor on S-referential algebras can be applied to those that correspond to Stone spaces, ensuring that this extension is coherent with established definitions. The authors suggest that such modal expansions, including multi-ary modal operators, could start with extending hyperspace topologies to endofunctors on S-referential algebras, with the goal of developing a general methodology for a broad range of modal expansions.
