Background and Objectives: Electronic fetal heart monitoring is widely utilized in developed countries during pregnancy to detect potential risks to the mother and the fetus. An alternative method, non-invasive fetal electrocardiogram (NI-FECG), which records from the maternal abdomen, could offer a more precise measurement of the fetal heart rate compared to traditional cardiotocography. Various approaches with unique pros and cons have emerged for detecting and processing NI-FECG signals.

Prenatal Cardiac Monitoring Importance: Prenatal cardiac monitoring is vital to identify fetal pathologies early on. The aim is to prevent fetal morbidity or mortality by enabling timely medical intervention or precautionary measures during or after delivery. A key purpose of fetal monitoring during labor is to promptly recognize signs of intrauterine hypoxia and facilitate early clinical response to prevent health complications.

NI-FECG Promise and Challenges: NI-FECG, taken from the maternal abdomen, offers an alternative to standard monitoring but faces difficulties, principally due to low signal-to-noise ratios, making fetal ECG detection challenging. There are significant issues to consider with noninvasive fetal ECG, despite it being marketed to expectant parents and it offering both remote data collection and real-time data sharing capabilities for heart rates and uterine activity.

Fetal ECG Signal Processing: Extracting a clean fetal ECG signal from noisy data remains a research challenge. The quality of the fetal ECG can be impacted by maternal heart signals, uterine contractions, and physical movements. Innovative algorithms are needed to improve the accuracy of fetal ECG signal processing. There's also a requirement to reconsider current methods of examining fetal heart function if we hope to develop technologies that facilitate ongoing, unobtrusive cardiac rhythm assessment.

Signal Processing Techniques: Techniques like empirical mode decomposition (EMD), which separates signals into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), and wavelet transform, which offers a method for denoising signals, are among the tools utilized in fetal ECG processing. However, signal quality can be compromised by nonstationary biological phenomena, making it essential to choose the relevant IMFs for reconstructing a usable fetal ECG.

Performance Evaluation: The performance of NI-FECG extraction algorithms is measured with statistical metrics such as sensitivity (SE), positive predictive value (PPV), accuracy (ACC), and F1 score, alongside the mean average error (MAE), which calculates the temporal discrepancy between detected and reference QRS values.

Optimal IMF Selection: Optimal selection of IMFs remains an unresolved issue in real-time signal processing. Although some algorithms have been developed for assessing the importance of IMFs, the area of noninvasive fetal ECG analysis still lacks comprehensive research on choosing the best IMFs for effective ECG signal reconstruction and improving fetal heart rate detection. The accuracy of the proposed correlation algorithm in identifying optimal IMFs was quantified, showing notable improvements in fetal heart rate estimation.

In summary, advancements in fetal ECG technology and signal processing are promising, but significant challenges remain, particularly regarding the interpretation and quality of the extracted fetal ECG signal from the abdominal recordings. Continuous research efforts are necessary to enhance detection methods and ensure the reliability of this noninvasive monitoring approach.
