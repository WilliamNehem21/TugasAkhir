Shamshiri et al. (2018) discuss the advancements in agricultural robotics, emphasizing the role of high-level sensing systems, machine vision, multi-robot cooperation, and modern software tools in enhancing efficiency.

A DC motor-driven feeding conveyor is controlled by an electronic circuit, which adjusts the motor based on the light sensor feedback comprising a pointed LED light source and an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor). When light from the LED is detected by the LDR, its resistance changes, affecting the related circuit, where an LM741 comparator then activates the motor when required.

The forward kinematics of a robotic arm are determined using trigonometry to calculate the end-effector's position and orientation based on input joint angles and link lengths. Points P1 and P5 are mentioned as being on the first row while P2, P3, and P4 belong to the second row of the conveyor, with certain areas not serviceable by the robotic arm due to its motion constraints.

The robotic arm incorporates four servo motors, three for the shoulder, elbow, and gripper and one for the base. An Arduino Uno microcontroller interprets the algorithm and outputs PWM signals, while a buffer IC is used to command one of the servos, and an LM317T-based voltage converter supplies appropriate voltages to the system. For safety, two ACS712 current sensors detect overload conditions and trigger a relay to cut power when necessary.

The robot arm's motion for seedling pick-and-place operations was simulated using Adams multibody software to validate its path and trajectory, ensuring smooth joint movement during the cycle.
