The increasing competition in service delivery and the high demand for business operations have led many organizations to adopt cloud computing for outsourcing IT services to manage business workflows and data. Cloud computing offers numerous benefits, such as high performance, availability, and scalability, helping organizations meet their growing demands cost-effectively.

In the face of these advantages, security remains a concern for those utilizing cloud computing. The proposed study introduces a method to explore the security-related costs associated with cloud computing. This method is founded on a multi-level security model that deals with the distribution of segmented workflows across hybrid cloud environments. The PEPA Eclipse plug-in tool will be utilized to develop a cost model that is informed by the viable deployment possibilities identified by the multi-level security model. This research intends to analyze deployment performance and estimate the costs associated with various deployment options and scenarios.

The move towards cloud computing by organizations is motivated by the desire to optimize performance and reduce the high costs associated with maintaining on-premises infrastructure. While the benefits are clear, there are also known security challenges like ensuring data confidentiality and privacy. Some enterprises opt for hybrid cloud solutions, using private clouds for sensitive data and public clouds for their computational advantages.

The research references other studies, such as Mach and Schikuta's cost model based on server energy consumption and Nada et al.'s method for partitioning Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) workflows to enhance performance and lower communication costs. Dillon et al. and Leinwand discuss the costs from the consumer's perspective, highlighting issues such as data transfer and additional charges for high-bandwidth applications on platforms like Windows Azure.

Cerotti et al. introduced a methodology to evaluate multi-core system performance in the cloud using benchmarks on virtualized and cloud platforms. Adriansyah et al. emphasized the importance of modeling business processes for performance analysis. The proposed study in this paper will further investigate these areas, focusing on cost modeling for segmented workflow deployment over hybrid clouds and comparing the outcomes from different workflow modeling languages.

The paper describes various deployment options for workflows in private and public clouds and uses PEPA terminology to explore scalability in cloud provision. Experimental observations indicate that certain deployment options yield similar performance, with scalability and resource bottlenecks influencing throughput.

This preliminary work using PEPA aims to explore the costs linked to different security strategies, illustrated through a healthcare application example. The study acknowledges potential limitations, such as not modeling data transfer costs, which could impact performance assessments across cloud types.

The paper concludes that predictions about service offerings from cloud providers are challenging due to the evolving nature of cloud systems. As cloud computing matures, different performance characteristics could be added to improve performance predictions. Ultimately, validation against real-world implementations is crucial, and the goal is to refine the modeling approach to demonstrate its utility before engaging in empirical validation.
