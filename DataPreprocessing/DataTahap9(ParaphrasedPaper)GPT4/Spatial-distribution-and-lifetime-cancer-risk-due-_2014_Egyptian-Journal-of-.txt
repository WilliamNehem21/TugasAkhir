The study examined the concentration ratio of uranium to thorium (U/Th) in surface soil samples, which ranged between 0.05 and 1.72, with an average value of 0.43. This average is significantly higher—by about 80%—than the global average of 0.26. To explore the data and understand the relationships between radiological parameters, the researchers applied cluster analysis (CA), principal component analysis (PCA), and Pearson correlation coefficient analysis. The CA and PCA revealed three distinct groups among the soil variables.

Background radiation, which comes from natural radionuclides, can vary depending on the quantity of radioactive materials in the environment. This radiation can increase due to pollution from both natural and human activities. Natural processes such as weathering and soil formation can bring materials from underground to the surface, where they may leach into groundwater and cause contamination at a distance from the source.

The migration capacity of radionuclides like uranium (U), radium (Ra), and thorium (Th) follows the order U > Ra > Th. Uranium can stay soluble for extended periods, enabling it to migrate through water systems over long distances. The horizontal transfer of uranium and thorium is primarily controlled by the exchange between sorption and desorption processes. Population growth and the use of fertilizers are exacerbating soil contamination.

Monitoring gamma radiation emitted by natural radionuclides is crucial to protecting people from lung cancer. The most significant gamma radiation sources are the uranium-radium and thorium decay chains. Conditions in the study area, such as geology and geography, influence the levels of radioactivity and thereby the risk of gamma radiation exposure in the soil.

Previous research by Ravisankar et al. in Yelagiri Hills reported that the average activity concentration of thorium-232 was higher than the global median value, while uranium-238 and potassium-40 were lower. In Yelagiri Hills, gamma radiation exposure is mainly due to increased thorium-232 in the soil. The present study continues this research in Yelagiri Hills, Tamil Nadu, to investigate the spatial distribution of natural radionuclides and use multivariate statistical methods to analyze the data.

Yelagiri, at an altitude of 1410 meters above sea level and spanning 30 square kilometers, is dotted with orchards, rose gardens, and valleys. It consists of 14 hamlets and temples, with Swamimalai Hill as the highest point and a popular trekking destination.

To measure radioactivity, the researchers provided lead shielding for the detection equipment to minimize cosmic ray background and lined it with cadmium and copper to reduce X-rays from the shield materials. Standard sources of primordial radionuclides from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) were used to calibrate the detection efficiency.

Potassium-40 was measured directly through its gamma ray emission, while uranium-238 and thorium-232 were measured indirectly through their decay products. The internal hazard index (Hin) was used to assess the internal exposure risk due to radon and its decay products.

For analysis, statistical software (SPSS 16.0) was used to process the spectrometric gamma technique data from soil samples in Yelagiri Hills. The study's aim was to draw conclusions regarding the distribution of radioactive elements in the soil.

In the end, the clusters of soil variables formed based on their similarities, with 100% similarity meaning no distance between clusters and 0% meaning a complete lack of similarity.
