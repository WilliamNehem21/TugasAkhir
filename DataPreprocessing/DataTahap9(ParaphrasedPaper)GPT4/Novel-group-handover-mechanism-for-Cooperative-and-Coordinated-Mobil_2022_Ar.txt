Here is a paraphrased version of the provided academic paper excerpt:

In a previous reference, we introduced the CCMF (context not given here) technology, which enhanced signal quality and internet experiences on high-speed railways. Deploying CCMF yielded significant improvements compared to other technologies. This system is utilized on trains and vehicles with large spatial dimensions and involves connecting CCMFs to certain infrastructure.

To address challenges in this domain, one solution involves adjusting transmission power. Specifically, as a train enters the overlapping coverage area of the current (serving) eNB (evolved Node B) and the next (target) eNB, the serving eNB can boost its power, delaying the handover (HO) process. This method prevents premature handovers until the train is nearer to the target eNB, at which point the target eNB increases its power while the serving eNB reduces power to allow for a smooth handover.

Problems arise when there are insufficient physical resource blocks (PRBs) to support incoming mobile femtocells (MFs) and their user equipment (UEs), leading to dropped connections. Passengers may have the option to connect directly to the terrestrial eNB (T eNB), but whether they connect to the MF or the T eNB, the connection quality is subject to vehicle penetration loss (VPL), path loss, and train speed, potentially resulting in unstable connectivity.

Furthermore, the likelihood of dropped calls or packets is high, which negatively impacts the quality of service (QoS) and the efficiency of the handover process, both critical measures for service providers. Contributing factors include VPL within train carriages, path loss, and shadowingâ€”the latter caused when an obstacle absorbs signal power, known as penetration loss, and is typical in vehicles and indoor settings. Additionally, path loss stems from signal power dissipation and propagation channel effects. In our high-speed train scenario (HSTS), the path-loss model employed is the microcell non-line-of-sight (NLOS) model.

This model predicts an increase in base station link variation, reaching a peak as the moving mobile femtocell on the train approaches the edge of the serving macrocell. Consequently, our proposed handover scheme facilitates the transition of the MF from the serving eNB to the target eNB, ensuring the connection of the MF and its associated UEs is maintained.

High-speed train systems (HSTS) are becoming crucial in transportation, offering rapid and cost-effective travel for many users. As wireless technologies and the automotive industry progress, providing internet connectivity inside trains is seen as the future of public transport. The vehicular network, a new class of wireless network, offers promising solutions for on-board connectivity through CCMF technology, despite the accompanying challenges.
