The study outlines the development of a new side-molding process for creating glass cavities with high-quality inner walls. This is crucial for mass-producing MEMS multi-optical-channel alkali metal atomic vapor cells. The inner walls are made smooth by squeezing a mold with a sleek surface inside the cavity at a specific temperature allowing for viscoelastic deformation. The result is a vapor cell with multiple optical channels that maintain optical quality with minimal internal stresses, confirmed via optical testing and measurement of free-induction decay (FID) signals.

This new method has several advantages over traditional processes, including the ability to smooth inner surfaces, minimal glass deformation, and reduced mold damage, which decreases costs. The paper describes the steps of constructing the vapor cell, from placing the molds to bonding, alkali metal injection, buffer gas filling, and wafer bonding and splitting.

Leakage rates and operational durability challenges were noted, with helium permeating the cell's borosilicate glass substrate likely exaggerating lab-measured leakage. To combat this, alternate materials such as aluminosilicate glass or protective alumina coatings were suggested despite the added cost.

The study also compares the properties of xenon-129 and xenon-131 isotopes. Xenon-131, with a nuclear spin of 3/2 and interactions with the electric quadrupole, exhibited unexpectedly narrower nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) linewidths compared to the spin-1/2 xenon-129, which is subject to only magnetic dipole interactions. The shorter relaxation time of xenon-129 might result from a polarization gradient in the pump light, suggesting future work might include efforts to increase spin-relaxation time of xenon-131 using coatings from hydrogen or deuterium interactions.

Overall, the paper presents a potentially valuable technique for advancing the production of atomic vapor cells used in a range of atomic devices, with the novel molding approach enhancing cell quality and performance.
