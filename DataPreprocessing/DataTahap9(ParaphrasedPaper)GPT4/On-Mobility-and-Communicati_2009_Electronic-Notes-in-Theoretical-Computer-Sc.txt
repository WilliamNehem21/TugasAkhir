Example (1) showcases communication exclusively. However, in examples (2) and (4), there is both movement and communication. It's evident upon close examination that examples (2) and (4) involve distinct types of movement, which can be termed one-dimensional movement and two-dimensional movement, respectively. In example (2), locations are restricted to a single plane with no nested locations allowed, whereas, in example (4), the ambient referred to as 'n' moves inside another ambient 'm', becoming its subambient.
