Advances in comprehending search behavior are contingent on developing a biological mechanism model that facilitates animals and humans to: i) generate diverse statistical movement patterns effortlessly and ii) naturally transition between these patterns in varied settings. Our paper introduces such a model and provides an analytical solution in Section 4.

Virtual environments (VEs) offer a simplified representation of the real world that enhances spatial awareness through virtual movement, navigation clarity, and interaction with virtual objects. The use of VEs for behavioral studies is on the rise, thanks to their ability to create controlled experimental situations. However, a significant challenge for VE users is maintaining awareness of their location and direction when their view is obstructed by in-VE objects. Human spatial skills, honed in natural environments, rely on physical cues for orientation, which are often missing in VEs, leading to spatial disorientation and requiring immediate strategy adaptation to move around VEs with limited multisensory input. Studying emergent adaptive strategies in VEs can highlight the biological mechanisms of search behavior more effectively than in-situ empirical data analyses. Additionally, VEs allow for extremely detailed human movement pattern analysis at very fine scales.

Gender differences in spatial abilities are well-documented but are not the focus of this paper; these observations will be reported in a future publication. Our analysis examines the role of scanning and reorienting behaviors in compensating for information deficits in VEs (Section 3.1) and explores the patterns of super-diffusive spread in search activities at larger spatiotemporal scales (Section 3.2).

In Section 4, we present a mathematical model for decision-making in reward-uncertain situations, capable of analytical solutions in some key scenarios (Section 4.3), leading to the development of biologically relevant hypotheses on decision-making processes. The paper concludes in the final section.

Participants for our study were recruited from Bielefeld University, none of whom were familiar with the actual building replicated in virtual models A and B. All adults and parents of minor participants consented to the study, which maintained confidentiality and anonymity of test results and allowed for voluntary withdrawal.

The VE experience lacks many natural movement-related cues, and the restriction of visual exploration to the display's limited field affects spatial orientation. Studies have found that optic flow, without proprioceptive feedback, is inadequate for updating heading direction in VEs.

Studies on small animals suggest that their movement patterns, alternating between scanning and reorientation, stem from their mechanical and sensory responses to the environment. For example, the zigzag motion of Daphnia is an optimal strategy for efficient resource exploitation within a patchy environment.

Evidence points to the human neuromodulatory system's role in managing reward-associated uncertainty, which influences exploration-vs-exploitation decisions. The system differentiates between known uncertainties signaled by acetylcholine and unexpected uncertainties signaled by norepinephrine, influencing an individual's decision to stay or explore.
