The concept of a matched filter is a prominent technique in the field of retinal vessel segmentation, with multiscale matched filters outperforming their single-scale counterparts due to better noise reduction capabilities. The challenge lies in finding the right parameter values for these filters. This paper introduces an approach that employs particle swarm optimization (PSO) to determine the optimal parameters for a multiscale Gaussian matched filter, aiming to enhance the accuracy of retinal vessel segmentation. Tested on the DRIVE and STARE retinal databases, the proposed approach achieved superior results compared to other algorithms for retinal vessel segmentation.

Research in the field has also explored various extensions of matched filters, including combinations with pulse-coupled neural networks and improvements using ant colony algorithms. The selection of appropriate scales for matched filters is crucial, as vessel widths in retina fundus images can vary significantly. The method proposed in this paper uses a multiscale filter for segmentation, specifically addressing the challenge of selecting the right parameter values for these filters.

Retinal vessel segmentation faces issues such as poor image quality, varying local intensity contrast of vessels, and the presence of noise, which can mask small vessels. To tackle these problems, the paper proposes the use of multiscale filters in conjunction with PSO for parameter value selection.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 3 provides an overview of the retinal databases used, as well as the fundamental concepts of matched filters, multiscale matched filters, and PSO. Section 4 details the implementation of the PSO-based multiscale Gaussian matched filter, while Section 5 presents the experimental results and discussions. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper.

Matched filters, which were first proposed by Chaudhuri et al., rely on the assumption that vessel cross-sections can be approximated by a Gaussian function. They have limited parameters and, although simple, they respond to both vessels and non-vessels, making performance enhancement desirable.

This work introduces a new optimization method using PSO to find optimal matched filter parameters, improving the detection of vessels of various sizes. Swarm intelligence algorithms, such as PSO, simulate the social behavior of animal groups like fish schools or bird flocks. The algorithm iteratively adjusts particle positions (solutions), guided by locally and globally best-known solutions until convergence is reached.

In the proposed approach, the multiscale filter is used for segmenting retinal vasculature and PSO for parameter optimization. Optimal parameters are identified using images from a database, and performance is measured using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.

The implementation, completed in MATLAB 7.12.0, demonstrated the effectiveness of the optimized Gaussian multiscale matched filter. It must be noted that the stochastic nature of PSO may result in different filter parameters if the optimization is re-run.
