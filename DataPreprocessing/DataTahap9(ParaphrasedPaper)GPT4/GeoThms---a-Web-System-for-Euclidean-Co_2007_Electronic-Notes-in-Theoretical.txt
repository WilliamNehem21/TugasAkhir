This paper discusses the Geothms system and its unique integration of geometric drawing systems (DGS) and automated theorem provers (ATP). While many existing systems incorporate features of DGS or ATP, offer web interfaces, or maintain repositories of geometric theorems, Geothms stands out for providing a comprehensive web-based platform that combines all these aspects. None of the encountered systems offer the same level of integration, including accessibility via the web, the ability to generate human-readable proofs, and the maintenance of an open repository for geometric constructs and conjectures. More detailed comparisons to related work are found in Section 6.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 details the components of Geothms; Section 3 describes the web interface; Section 4 discusses the communication and representation issues; Section 5 provides illustrated examples of Geothms in action; Section 6 considers related work; Section 7 outlines future work; and Section 8 presents the conclusions.

The paper also introduces GCLCprover, an ATP based on the area method, which allows for formal reasoning about objects constructed within DGSs. It generates proofs in human-readable formats, such as LaTeX and XML, providing clear justifications at each step. This prover is seamlessly integrated with the GCLC framework, allowing users to prove their conclusions directly within their GCLC constructions. To accommodate constructions made in Eukleides, a tool named EukToGCLCprover has been created for conversion to the GCLCprover format.

Access to full Geothms functionalities is restricted to registered users, with contributors granted extra privileges to input or update data.

The paper briefly discusses other related systems: GEOTHER, a Maple-implemented environment designed for manipulating and proving geometric theorems with a Java-based GUI; and Geometriagon, which hosts a vast repository of classical Euclidean geometry problems solvable with ruler and compass, accessible for modification by registered users, though it lacks an ATP component and does not offer formal proofs.
