This academic review is structured into several parts, focusing on the resources and methods used in pharmacovigilance (PV), specifically in the detection of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and drug-drug interactions (DDIs). The main data sources utilized in PV are discussed first, followed by an examination of data mining techniques regulatory agencies use for signal detection. Additionally, machine learning (ML) algorithms used in predicting DDIs are explored. The review concludes by addressing the limitations of current practices and suggesting areas for future research.

Spontaneous Reporting Systems (SRSs) are integral for continuous monitoring of drugs in PV systems. They adhere to international safety reporting guidelines (ICH E2B), providing vital data for causality assessments, yet they are subject to well-known biases such as over- or underreporting.

The principles behind multiplicative and additive models used in assessing drug safety concerns are also covered. In the case of DDIs, these models either multiply the risk by the background estimate (multiplicative) or add the safety concern to the background estimate (additive).

Researchers have turned to unstructured data sources, such as electronic health records (EHRs) and biomedical databases, using text mining and natural language processing (NLP) to overcome the limitations of SRS and predict adverse DDI signals more effectively.

Jon D. Duke et al. proposed a method mining PV literature to predict potential DDIs, especially those related to myopathy, verifying these predictions with an EHR database.

Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and kernel functions, like the Gaussian radial basis function (RBF), are used in SVM models to classify non-linear data.

Unsupervised ML, such as clustering and biclustering, is applied to unlabeled data to discover regularities and underlying patterns.

Network-based ML approaches infer drug similarities or learn from the topological features of networks constructed from various data sources, forming complex relationships like drug-gene or drug-target networks.

Naive Bayes (NB) models, known for their simplicity, assume predictor features are independent, which is a significant limitation.

Improving the precision of supervised and unsupervised ML methods, including better annotation of DDI corpora and establishing standardized guidelines, is essential for developing realistic ML frameworks in drug safety.

The review also highlights the challenges in navigating the vast amount of scientific literature, where text mining and NLP are paramount for managing unstructured biomedical data.

The paper concludes that freely available safety data, combined with advanced DM and ML methods, have enhanced the PV field, particularly in the detection of adverse DDI signals. Despite the progress, there's a need for better-guided assessment of informatics methods and refining DDI signal detection to balance sensitivity and specificity while reducing false signals.
