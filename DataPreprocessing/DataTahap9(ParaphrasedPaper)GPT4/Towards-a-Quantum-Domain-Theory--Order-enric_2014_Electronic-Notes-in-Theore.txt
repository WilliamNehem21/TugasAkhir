We aim to explore the distinctions and parallels between probabilistic and quantum computations utilizing operator algebra theory by revealing their underlying domain-theoretic and topological features. This intersection between operator algebras and domain theory hasn't been extensively leveraged before, possibly because the operator algebra framework, less familiar to computer scientists, predated domain theory development. Our primary contribution bridges two scholarly communities: theoretical computer scientists who apply domain theory toward programming language semantics and logic, and mathematicians and physicists who investigate W*-algebras.

We use B(H) to represent the set of all bounded operators and EF(H) for the set of all positive, bounded operators under the identity on a Hilbert space H. Various standard topologies on B(H) are discussed in the paper.

The paper presents a theorem that broadens the notion that the effects of a W*-algebra A (positive unital maps from C^2 to A) can be organized into a directed-complete partially ordered set (poset). Furthermore, Theorem 2.2 is noted to be capable of generalization with a proof similar to the original.

In operator theory, when a C*-algebra is described as monotone-complete, it indicates that it has directed-completeness for bounded increasing sequences of positive elements. This concept of monotone-completeness, traced at least as far back as to the work of Dixmier and Kadison, is for the first time explicitly linked to the concept of directed-completeness. Appendix A provides a deeper exploration of the relationship between operator theory and order theory for interested readers.

A C*-algebra A is established as a W*-algebra if, and only if, it is monotone-complete and possesses a sufficient amount of normal states such that these states distinguish the elements of A. This is reinforced by the referenced theorem (see[15, theorem 3.16]). By integrating this information with Proposition A.2, an order-theoretic description of W*-algebras is offered in the paper.
