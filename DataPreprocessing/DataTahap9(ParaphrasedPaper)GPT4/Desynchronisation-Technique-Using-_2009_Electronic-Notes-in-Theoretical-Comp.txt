The academic paper discusses methods to prevent deadlocks when transitioning from synchronous systems to Globally Asynchronous, Locally Synchronous (GALS) architectures. In the GALS model, signals are received out-of-order, and constraints must be applied to prevent the system from entering deadlock. Synchronization using clocks is reviewed, with levels of synchronicity ranging from fully synchronous to fully asynchronous. The appropriate execution policy for the Petri net model, which influences performance, is considered.

The paper introduces the Max-O semantics to describe distributed architectures, departing from the standard interleaving semantics of Petri nets (PN) which lack the concept of maximal concurrent firing of transitions. Max-O semantics help ensure that output transitions fire concurrently, as opposed to more relaxed steps in interleaving semantics.

The authors propose a way to model distributed architectures from synchronous systems using the theory of Petri nets with localities, distinguishing between input and output transitions. This method allows for input transitions to execute upon arrival while constraining output transitions to fire maximally and persistently. Burst-mode circuits are referenced as an analogy for introducing flexibility in handling burst events while maintaining input/output causality.

The paper tackles synthesizing a GALS system through a desynchronization methodology using Petri nets, offering finer granularity in the design and easing automation for large complex circuits. The GALS system retains the synchronous behavior of input-output signals by applying the theory of localities to a synchronous model.

Automating the proposed methodology is suggested to decrease design time and manual designer effort. Optimizing locality allocation aims to minimize interconnections and enhance component speed. The methodology could also consider alternative unbundling strategies for transitions, leading to different conditions for persistent steps, and potentially different desynchronized systems.
