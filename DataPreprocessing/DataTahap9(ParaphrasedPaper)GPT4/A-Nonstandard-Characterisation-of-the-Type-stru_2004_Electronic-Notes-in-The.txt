This academic paper proposes a different method for organizing a hierarchy by employing algebraic domains that incorporate the concept of completeness. The foundational domain is constructed from the collection of all sealed intervals of rational numbers. Normann demonstrated the existence of a dense subset within this structure, and also presented a characterization of the hierarchy within the Cartesian closed category of Kuratowski limit spaces.

During the demonstration of this assertion, the authors invoke the transfer principle, a concept often used in nonstandard analysis. The proof relies on applying this principle, which would have been straightforward if 'c' were an actual natural number. The principle allows for the same seamless application of the argument to 'c' when it is a hyperfinite number, meaning a type of large finite number from nonstandard analysis that behaves analogously to natural numbers within its system.
