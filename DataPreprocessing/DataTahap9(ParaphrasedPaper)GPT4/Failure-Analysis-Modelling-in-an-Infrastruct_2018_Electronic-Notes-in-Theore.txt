Predicting failures in technology systems remains a difficult task due to the increasing complexity of high-performance cloud data centers. As technology advances, it becomes crucial to consider system failures when designing next-generation systems. Traditional fault tolerance methods like data replication and checkpointing are not adequately effective for modern computing infrastructures. This underscored the need for developing robust prediction models that can accurately foresee future system failures.

In this study, we examined data on faults occurring during production gathered over five years at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Centre (NERSC). Utilizing the Computer Failure Data Repository (CFDR), we built a predictive model tailored for high-performance cloud data center infrastructures. Our model employed the Auto-Regressive Moving Average (ARMA) approach and achieved a promising 95% accuracy rate in predicting potential system failures. We are confident that our method is practical and easily adoptable in current real-time systems.

Cloud service providers must offer scalable, efficient, and reliable resources on-demand to meet their Service Level Agreements (SLAs), despite the commonality of component failures. Large cloud data centers need to ensure a degree of availability to support businesses effectively. Cloud systems have the potential for high failure rates due to their extensive server networks, high workloads, and geographical dispersion. Reliable cloud services require infrastructure designs that minimize or negate downtime, traditionally relying on replication and checkpointing strategies for maintaining availability.

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provides basic support for computing resources, storage, and networking capabilities, which are crucial for sustaining high availability amidst failures. IaaS offerings, such as Rackspace, GoGrid, EC2, and Amazon Cloud, include virtual machines, load balancers, fault tolerance, and firewall services. Clients receive the tools to manage software deployments, including operating systems and applications.

Platform as a Service (PaaS) encompasses a broader range of services, including APIs, operating systems, development environments, and servers. The client maintains applications while the provider manages runtime services, databases, and storage. PaaS solutions, like Microsoft Windows Azure and Google App Engine, focus on application hosting, development, testing, and maintenance, thereby allowing users to concentrate on high-value software development.

The remainder of the paper outlines related work (Section 2), elaborates on our methodology and system model (Section 3), presents results and analysis (Section 4), and concludes the study (Section 5).

Previous research has not fully analyzed and predicted the empirical characteristics of cloud and high-performance failures. Some previous studies examined larger-scale cloud environments but did not explore the relationship between workload intensity, system size, and failures.

In our study, we leveraged a publicly available dataset, enabling others to compare their results with ours and didn't limit our predictions to a single hardware type but aimed to forecast various component failures. For a broader literature review, readers are referred to specific citations.

Classical time series models, such as ARIMA developed by Box and Jenkins, have been widely applied across many fields, including data centers, industrial systems, transportation networks, and healthcare, for failure prediction.

The NERSC data focused on capturing detailed information on I/O system and component failures. Collected data from 2001 to 2006 included storage, networking, computing machines, and file systems. The data, initially from the Remedy system, now resides in a MySQL database and can be exported to Excel format as part of the PDSI project.
