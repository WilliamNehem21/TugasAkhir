This academic paper focuses on the challenges of maintaining quality in human computation within crowdsourcing environments, recognizing the inherent risks due to the open-access nature of such platforms. To mitigate these risks, the paper proposes a system combining Trust-Based Access Control (TBAC) and fuzzy-expert systems to regulate crowd worker access and enhance computation quality. The researchers developed a TBAC-fuzzy algorithm, which they implemented using MATLAB 7.6.0. This algorithm computes a trust value for each worker, a priority value based on a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS), and makes access decisions accordingly.

The study ambitiously explores the broader context of quality attributes in online transactions, such as response time, reliability, and usability, with a concentration on confidentiality and transaction integrity. In crowd-sourced platforms like an internet encyclopedia, crowd workers' trust value significantly impacts their access rights. Trust values are assigned based on competencies, experience, and past activities.

The paper introduces a postprocessing module that employs the fuzzy expert system to prioritize workers, allowing only those with priority levels above a certain threshold to contribute, thus ensuring higher quality contributions. Initial trust values are set for new and existing workers according to their skill levels, and simulations are run in MATLAB, demonstrating that tasks are only accessible to workers above the defined priority threshold.

The main contribution of the paper is the integration of a fuzzy expert system with TBAC as a unified framework to improve the quality of responses from crowd workers, addressing issues like cheating in answer ranking. The experimentation with the TBAC-fuzzy algorithm shows promising results for achieving higher quality contributions from crowd workers.
