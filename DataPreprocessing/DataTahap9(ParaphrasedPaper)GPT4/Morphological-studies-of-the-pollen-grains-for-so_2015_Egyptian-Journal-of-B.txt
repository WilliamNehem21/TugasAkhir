This study investigates the pollen morphology of forty aquatic plant species from four coastal Mediterranean lakes in Egypt between January and August 2012. The species, which are categorized into floating, submerged, and emergent groups, belong to 17 different plant families. The majority of the pollen grains examined are prolate-spheroidal, spheroidal, or triangular in shape, with tectum surfaces ranging from psilate to granulate, reticulate, or microechinate. Pollen grain classification is predominantly based on aperture types: colporate, colpate, and porate, with some families (Cyperaceae, Juncaceae, Potamogetonaceae, and Ruppiaceae) displaying inaperturate pollen.

These characteristics—polarity, symmetry, aperture types, and exine sculpturing—are considered essential for phylogenetic and evolutionary differentiation of pollen types. The collected pollen, now housed in the Mansoura University herbarium, serves as a valuable reference for palynologists, ecologists, and taxonomists studying the northern Egyptian lakes.

Palynology, the study of pollen and spores, provides significant information rapidly from small material samples and is used for various applications, including surveys of atmospheric pollen, spore analysis, and archaeological investigations.

Previous research has focused on pollen morphology in several dicot families globally. However, this study aims to enhance understanding of the pollen morphology of aquatic plants in Egypt's northern Mediterranean lakes through light microscopy, supporting additional taxonomic identification tools.

Pollen for this study was extracted from the fresh flowers of 37 aquatic species, with preparation methods detailed by Moore et al., and assessed using light microscopy. The specimen pollens were prepared with a boiling 10% KOH treatment followed by acetolysis and mounted on glass slides with glycerin jelly.

Pollen grains were generally radially symmetrical (with exceptions), and their characteristics categorized by shape, size, apertural types, symmetry, polarity, and exine sculpturing. The primary pollen types identified were colporate, colpate, porate, with a few inaperturate grains. Additionally, the study notes the exine texture thickness and various surface patterns such as psilate, granulate, reticulate, and microechinate.

This research contributes valuable data to the morphological diversity of aquatic plant pollen and its taxonomic implications.reflects on how surface patterns, especially the primitive psilate surface, were previously considered in the context of angiosperms and specific families like acanthaceae by researchers like Walker, Doyle, and Furness.
