Vulnerability is described as any flaw or event that could compromise the integrity, functionality, or confidentiality of a system, device, or service. Numerous vulnerabilities are identified each year, and organizational administrators with the means of addressing these issues typically prioritize those deemed most critical. However, only a limited number of companies and systems engage in such risk assessments. The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), which is derived from the open platform provided by the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST), offers a quantitative approach to assess the severity of vulnerabilities through simple formulas that produce a numerical severity score. The use of standardized metrics facilitates objective comparisons between different vulnerabilities, making the CVSS highly beneficial. It is often easier to describe the implications of vulnerabilities using linguistic terms rather than to identify and compute the fundamental parameters for the CVSS scoring. The research presented in the paper aims to create a model that can estimate CVSS base scores from vulnerability descriptions by utilizing Fuzzy Logistic Regression (FLR).
