Increasing the window size (m) in the analysis enhances results, but excessively large m can cause counterproductive decomposition which leads to the mixing of residual components. Occasionally, minor adjustments to m can mitigate this issue and improve the separation of components. Therefore, Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) was executed multiple times with varying m values to determine the optimal setting.

The analysis involves separating the data into signal (Xr) and noise (Xn) subspaces. Employing a different window size (m2) on the noise subspace, we perform Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to further decompose it into signal (X1r) and noise components (Xn). This process is repeated with different window sizes until a combination of all the signal subspace components, (Xr) + (X1r) + ... + (Xr), achieves an effective distinction between signal and noise. To ascertain the most suitable window size that facilitates this separation, the method requires numerous iterations and adjustments.
