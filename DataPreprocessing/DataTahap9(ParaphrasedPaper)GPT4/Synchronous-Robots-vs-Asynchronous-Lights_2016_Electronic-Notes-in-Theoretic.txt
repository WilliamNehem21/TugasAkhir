Our research presents two distinct computational tasks and demonstrates that one can be accomplished in a fully synchronous model but not in an asynchronous model enhanced with signaling capabilities (lights), while the reverse is true for the other task. This finding implies that the fully synchronous model and the asynchronous lights-enhanced model have distinct computational capabilities when applied to graph-based problems, suggesting a rich area for future research to investigate the unique features that differentiate these models.

The study also explores various assumptions that influence the computational abilities of robots, such as whether robots possess unique identifiers or whether they have memory from previous computational cycles. Robots can be categorized as either having persistent memory or being oblivious, meaning they have no recollection of past events and hence, start each cycle with no historical information.

Various tasks and problems have been analyzed in the field, including the gathering problem, pattern formation, and exploration. The settings for these tasks vary; robots can move on a Euclidean plane or along predefined graphs, which can be known or unknown. Communication between robots might be facilitated through tokens, while some tasks may have an associated objective function to be optimized, such as minimizing the number of robots, steps, or the maximum steps taken by any robot to achieve a goal.

Our study draws inspiration from Das et al., who compared the computational powers of robots in a Look-Compute-Move (LCM) model with different synchronization levels, luminous capabilities, and memory constraints. Their results established dominance relationships between standard models and those versions augmented with lights or snapshots or both.

The concept of dominance is represented by symbols between models. A direct arrow from model A to model B indicates that all problems solvable in A are also solvable in B, while a triple bar signifies that each model can solve the same set of problems as the other.

Notably, since the robots are indistinguishable and anonymous, it is crucial that the graph's nodes can be uniquely identified to solve the problem. Otherwise, an adversary could force two robots occupying the same node to move together perpetually, making it impossible to achieve different positions and thus rendering the problem unsolvable.

The input for one of the tasks includes two robots and a path graph with at least six nodes, where the robots start at different nodes neither at nor adjacent to the path's endpoints. The distance between them, in terms of the number of edges, is crucial for coordination.

One robot moves based on the other's indicator light color. If the light is red, it signifies that the other robot has already moved, and thus it should move away by one edge, increasing their separation to ensure the sequence of turns is maintained. Conversely, if the light is blue, it indicates that the robot should move closer by one edge. This coordination allows the robots to maintain or alter their distance dynamically as required.
