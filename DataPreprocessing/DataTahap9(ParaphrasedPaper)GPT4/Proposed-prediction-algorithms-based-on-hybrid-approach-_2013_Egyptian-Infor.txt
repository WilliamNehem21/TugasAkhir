RFID technology, commonly employed in healthcare due to its improved functionality and ease of use, faces challenges with data quality stemming from reader-generated data streams that often contain duplicates, false positives, and false negatives. This "dirty" data hampers the broad adoption of RFID systems. Data cleansing becomes crucial to provide reliable information before storing it for applications' use. While current strategies for addressing anomalies include physical, middleware, and deferred approaches, they have limitations. A robust RFID system could benefit from a combined middleware and deferred approach, as our hybrid algorithms have demonstrated effectiveness in predicting and correcting false positives, negatives, and duplications in a healthcare setting simulation. The cleansing methods show improved accuracy and efficiency, offering lower healthcare costs, enhanced business processes, and increased patient safety.

RFID readers generate vast amounts of data, including redundant and error-ridden information, directly impacting organizational effectiveness across levels, notably in healthcare where data integration and cleaning are driven by cost reduction and patient care improvement efforts. Issues arise due to RFID signals picking up unintended tags (false positives) and repeated readings by multiple readers or the same reader over time. Our proposed cleansing method, CBADA (Cleansing Based on Anomaly Detection Algorithm), targets these issues in the middleware phase, improving data before database entry. The paper covers how RFID tags should only trigger readings within specified zones and time windows to minimize irrelevant or excessive data, crucial for managing RFID data streams in environments like hospitals.
