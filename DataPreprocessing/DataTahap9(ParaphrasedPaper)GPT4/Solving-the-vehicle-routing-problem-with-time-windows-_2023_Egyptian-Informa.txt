The paper addresses the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW), a notable logistical and transportation challenge relevant to many real-world scenarios. The aim here is to determine the shortest cumulative distance for a fleet of vehicles departing from a warehouse and visiting predefined customers within assigned time slots. This problem is classified as NP-hard. To tackle it, a new optimization approach, the Modified Football Game Algorithm (MFGA), is designed to mimic the actions of football players seeking the most advantageous positions on the field while being guided by a team coach.

The MFGA not only introduces a novel technique for generating an initial VRPTW solution but also advances a more effective strategy for repositioning a player, thereby improving the algorithm's efficiency. The paper emphasizes the crucial role of transportation in economic development and global competition, highlighting the shift from viewing it as a secondary service to recognizing it as a strategic sector.

Due to the computational complexity of VRPTW, exact algorithms are inefficient for large instances, prompting researchers to apply approximate methods. Other approximate solutions to VRPTW discussed include the Harmony Search Algorithm (HAS), Memetic Algorithm (MA), Tabu Search (TS), and Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS). Various hybrid and enhanced methodologies are also covered, combining different algorithms to address both global and local search objectives effectively, improve existing techniques, and prevent premature convergence.

The MFGA is positioned within this landscape as an alternative strategy, inspired by football dynamics, that seeks a balance between diversification and intensification. This population-based algorithm employs the notion of collective human intelligence as seen in football teams aiming to score goals. In this context, each “player” in the algorithm represents a solution to VRPTW. Initial solutions are randomly generated, and through iterative processes, players or solutions move towards better positions, analogous to football strategies, until an optimal solution is found.

A key feature of the MFGA is the ability of the “coach” to substitute poorly performing players with better ones, enhancing the overall performance of the algorithm. The paper is organized to introduce the original Football Game Algorithm (FGA) first, then MFGA is detailed, followed by experiments and results, ultimately ending with discussions and conclusions.

Lastly, the algorithm's implementation specifics are mentioned, including its coding in MATLAB, the execution environment, and the need for careful parameter tuning, particularly population size and customer numbers, to ensure efficient algorithm performance.
