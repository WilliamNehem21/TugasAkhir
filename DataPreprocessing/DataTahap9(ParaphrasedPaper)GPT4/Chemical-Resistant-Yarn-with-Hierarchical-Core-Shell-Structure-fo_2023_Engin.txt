The academic paper describes various methods used to analyze high crystalline silk textiles (HCSTs):

1. Morphology Observation: The shapes and structures of the HCSTs were examined using an optical microscope (RH2000; Hirox, Japan).

2. Contact Angle Measurement: A goniometer (SL200KS; Kino Industry Co., Ltd, USA) was employed to measure how the contact angle of water on the HCSTs changed when the textiles were stretched.

3. Tensile Testing: The mechanical strength and elasticity of the textiles were tested using a universal material testing system (Instron 5943; Instron, USA).

4. Resistance Monitoring: Changes in electrical resistance of the textiles under deformation were tracked using a digital multimeter (Keysight 34470A; Keysight, USA).

5. Air Permeability Assessment: The ability of air to pass through different textile samples was measured using an air permeability tester (G571; Standard International Group (HK) Limited, China). The testing conditions included a sample area of 20 cm^2 and a pressure of 200 Pa, in accordance with the Chinese national standard GB/T 5453.
