The paper discusses how local partially ordered spaces (pospaces), a concept proposed by L. Fajstrup, E. Goubault, and M. Raussen as a framework for analyzing concurrent systems, fit into the broader context of homotopy theory. It highlights that the category of local pospaces, when considered in relation to a fixed local pospace, forms a fibration category as defined by H. Baues. Within this category, the appropriate form of homotopy is known as relative directed homotopy.

Homotopy methods, from the field of algebraic topology, have proven effective for addressing issues in concurrency theory, the branch of computer science focusing on parallel computations. Topological constructs like pospaces, local pospaces, flows, globular CW-complexes, and D-spaces have all been utilized for modeling concurrent systems. E. Goubault provides a comprehensive introduction to these various topological models.

The current paper seeks to delve into the homotopy theory—specifically, the relative directed homotopy theory—of local pospaces. Previous research indicated that the category of pospaces (not necessarily with a closed partial order) qualifies as both a fibration and a cofibration category when aligned with a fixed pospace. However, it remains uncertain if the category of local pospaces (in reference to a fixed local pospace) can be considered a cofibration category mainly because it is unclear if this category possesses sufficient colimits. P. Bubenik and K. Worytkiewicz have made progress by establishing a closed model category that encapsulates the category of local pospaces as a subcategory, yet questions remain regarding the construction of colimits within this framework.
