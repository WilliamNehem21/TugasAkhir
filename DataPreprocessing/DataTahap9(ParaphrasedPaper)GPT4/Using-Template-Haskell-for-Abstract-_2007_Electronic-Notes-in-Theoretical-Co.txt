This academic paper discusses the employment of Template Haskell, an extension to Haskell for compile-time metaprogramming, to perform static program analysis and code transformation. Template Haskell, which is part of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (version 6.4.1), leverages the `Language.Haskell.TH` library to provide such functionality. The paper describes the implementation of strictness analysis based on abstract interpretation, as well as a transformation from `let` to `case` expressions that leverages the analysis results. While the problems of strictness analysis and `let`-to-`case` transformation are already adequately addressed, this paper focuses on the issues that arise from using Template Haskell as a tool for these implementations.

Template Haskell works by allowing programmers to inspect, modify, and generate code during the compilation process. It operates on a monadic library, with the `Q` monad encapsulating metaprogramming operations like generating fresh names, and it extends the `IO` monad. With monadic operations and the ability to splice code at compile-time, developers can dynamically manage Haskell's abstract syntax trees.

Key findings highlight both the advantages and limitations of using Template Haskell for such tasks. Incorporating new analyses and transformations into the compiler can be done without modification to the compiler itself. The tools allow for compile-time analysis and the transformation of expressions, with the outcomes dependent on the type of expressions. Limitations include loss of precision in static analysis, lack of type information in the syntax tree, and the need for further enhancements to make Template Haskell more conducive for type-based analyses and other extensions.

The authors propose potential improvements to the tool, such as tighter integration of typing algorithms, to facilitate type-based analyses, demonstrating the utility of Template Haskell in augmenting the compiler with new features in a non-intrusive way.
