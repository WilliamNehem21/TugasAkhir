The academic paper discusses the relationship between static and dynamic semantics in programming language compilers and the possibility of extending the scope of static analysis beyond type checking to encompass other properties like security, resource usage, or effect. Essentially, the paper explores how static semantics can provide compile-time guarantees that certain runtime behaviors will be satisfied, such as preventing security violations.

The paper highlights two main benefits of separating compilation into static and dynamic phases: efficiency, as compile-time checks can eliminate the need for certain runtime tests, and predictability, whereby the static phase can assure certain runtime program behaviors. It acknowledges, however, the increasing complexity in defining and proving consistency between static analyses and dynamic semantics as language features become more sophisticated.

One alternative proposed is a unified semantics that blends static and dynamic checks, which may simplify the overall process but can also blur the distinction between compile-time and runtime errors. The paper references the concept of constructing a type checker from a semantic specification, a subject explored by Neil Jones in 1991, noting that while it is not a new idea, little progress has been made in this domain.

The paper then introduces the idea of using partial evaluation to specify static semantics but identifies its limitations in not providing explicit constructions of a type system or static operations. It proposes pass separation, a staging transformation, as an alternative approach to distinguish between different kinds of computations.

The paper concludes by questioning the origins of types in the context of type systems and suggests that the approach taken can be seen as part of proving type soundness. It then speculates on the potential for converting a dynamically typed language like Scheme into a statically typed one like ML by starting with a simple conception of type and then ensuring that "safe states" lead to other "safe states" through rule rewriting, an approach that merits further research.
