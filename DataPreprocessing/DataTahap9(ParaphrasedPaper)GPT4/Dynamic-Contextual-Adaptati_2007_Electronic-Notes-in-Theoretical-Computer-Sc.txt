This paper discusses the challenges of adapting commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components for use in varying conditions not initially anticipated by their creators. Specifically, the paper emphasizes the need for systems that can dynamically modify their behavior in response to changing environmental conditions. The authors propose a method for dynamically mapping the interfaces of adaptable components by using contextual environments to create flexible adaptation policies. This approach surpasses the limitations of previous static mapping methods.

The paper particularly addresses adaptation issues at two levels: the signature level and the protocol level. Signature-level adaptors are commonly available in component-oriented platforms like CORBA, J2EE, and .NET, which manage interoperability between software components. However, these adaptors often fail to sufficiently address the concurrent behavior of components, leaving gaps in proper interoperability.

Building on recent research, the authors focus on adapting components' behavior dynamically, at both signature and protocol levels. The approach is especially relevant for mobile and pervasive computing, where systems may need to adapt in real time to different networks and changing environments.

Instead of using Finite State Machines (FSMs), this research leverages process algebras to specify behavioral interfaces at a higher level. An example scenario is presented where a client component interacts with a Video-on-Demand (VOD) system server, demonstrating how user profiles can change during interactions and necessitating adaptation between the components.

The system distinguishes between different user profiles by translating messages in a context-aware manner. Unlike static approaches where message correspondences are fixed, the proposed method enables dynamic, context-sensitive message translation.

The authors describe a formal notation for contextual component adaptation that provides dynamic mappings and addresses previous inflexibilities, such as managing dynamic access rights. They present a case study of a VOD system to exemplify their proposal, detailing an algorithm for building a specification for the contextual adaptor and outlining the deployment process for an actual adaptor.

Finally, the paper suggests that future work should incorporate security policies into the dynamic adaptation process to ensure safe and deadlock-free interactions between adapted components.
