To manage the overwhelming complexity of large systems, a compositional approach to their development is essential to circumvent the issue of combinatorial explosion in both the specification and verification stages (as seen in references [10,19,3,2,16,4,5,15]). This method enables the construction of a large system by piecing together pre-existing systems using defined constructors, transforming the challenging task of verifying the whole system's correctness into more manageable correctness assessments of its individual subcomponents.

The process, denoted as "p," represents a single step in production. If a car is available, process p might undertake a sequence of tasks which include obtaining the car, tuning the engine, installing the windshield, inspecting the vehicle, and then placing it on the conveyor belt. Alternatively, p could follow a different sequence where it acquires the car, fits the windshield, tunes the engine, performs a quality control check, and subsequently returns the car. Following either sequence, p is ready to repeat the cycle. The first of these sequences can be concretely specified.

Research conducted in [4,5] delved into the compositionality properties of a 'choppy' logic, which serves as an augmented version of the classical propositional temporal logic (PTL) through the incorporation of a 'chop' operator. They formulated a modal process logic that possesses the attribute of compositionality. The limitation of this logic, however, lies in its ability to express only the regular properties of processes.
