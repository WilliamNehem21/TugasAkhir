Example 3.16 describes a Kripke model that emulates the behavior of a local business office network including three computers and two printers under a central server's control. The model's focus is on printing protocols, and it assumes that the primary function of employees using the computers is document printing.

The interaction between concurrent actions and their coordination is applicable in modeling a broad range of games. A recent study employed concurrency operators to represent games played simultaneously. The researchers in that study built upon Concurrent Propositional Dynamic Logic (CPDL) to develop a logic framework for dynamic games with concurrent moves. However, their logic, much like CPDL, does not account for communication between players, which is a notable limitation.

Given that the extension from CPDL to its communicative counterpart (channel-CPDL) leads to challenges, particularly loss of decidability and lack of a comprehensive set of axioms, our proposed logic could potentially offer a superior framework for extending the logic introduced to handle simultaneous games that involve communication. This was briefly demonstrated in the context of the paper.
