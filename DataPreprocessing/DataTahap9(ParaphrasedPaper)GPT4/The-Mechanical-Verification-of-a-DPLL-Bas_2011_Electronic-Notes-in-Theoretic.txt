This paper presents the initial steps toward validating an effective implementation of a SAT solver as part of a broader research agenda aimed at establishing a secure foundation for inference. This includes developing a verified reference kernel that incorporates a verified SAT solver. To achieve this verification, the authors utilize predicate subtypes and dependent types in PVS to encapsulate the specifications and maintain the essential invariants.

Inference procedures, critical in programming and various other fields, have seen significant advancements in performance and capability, particularly SAT and SMT solvers. These solvers play a pivotal role in activities such as assertional verification, different model checking approaches, and planning. Enhancing their efficiency and effectiveness is of paramount importance.

The paper details an interactive verification process that takes advantage of PVS's language and inference features. Through the PVS system, the authors could manually guide proofs by delving deeply into the formulation specifics. The goal moving forward is to examine possibilities for more automated proof strategies, especially harnessing SAT and SMT solvers.

PVS is a verification framework that relies on higher-order logic and interactive proof. It extends standard logic with several advanced features, including predicate subtypes, dependent types, and a range of definitions and proof strategies. In PVS, users can craft proofs interactively, leveraging a suite of automated tools and creating new proof strategies from existing ones.

The authors' PVS formalization covers several components, from the resolution inference rule, partial assignment representations, and crucial operations, to the main procedures - propagate, analyze, and the DPLL algorithm. These formalizations heavily utilize predicate subtypes and dependent types to ensure type correctness, generating proof obligations that are then resolved via the PVS theorem prover.

A critical aspect of the verification is demonstrating the DPLL algorithm's termination to prove its correctness. Here, the challenge lies in verifying that the evolving partial assignment will eventually cease to grow. The complexity of the proof is not in the orderings but in proving that the ordering is finite and the datatype invariants hold.

In conclusion, this paper describes the mechanized verification of a DPLL-based SAT search procedure within PVS, posing challenges that can test automated tools and serve as a basis for different formalization approaches. This work is an initial stride toward crafting a trusted verification kernel and paves the way for future explorations into more efficient and expressive satisfiability procedures. The authors recognize the potential for improvement in both formalization techniques and the automation of proof construction, despite the promising results that show even relatively inexperienced users can construct complex proofs with moderate effort.
