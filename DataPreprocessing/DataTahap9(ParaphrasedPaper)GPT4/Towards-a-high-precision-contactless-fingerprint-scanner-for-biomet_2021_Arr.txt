In a world where diseases can easily spread, non-contact biometric authentication devices become important for maintaining hygiene and safety, as well as preventing transmission of contagious infections. Fingerprint recognition is a common and effective form of identification, but it poses a high risk for transmission of contagious diseases, such as COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

The current challenge lies in the development of high-resolution, contactless fingerprint scanners that are imperative in curbing the spread of infections without undermining security.

We present various advancements toward improving the accuracy and reducing the false positive rates of contactless fingerprint scanners. This manuscript compares our developed device with existing technologies, underlining its distinct and innovative aspects. Our methodology's major contributions are precise, actual contactless fingerprint scanning, increased accuracy due to an advanced acquisition process, and an efficient and user-friendly fingerprinting system.

Unlike traditional scanners, our system can identify different fingers and uses image recognition algorithms akin to those in face recognition tech. Image files are converted into a digital format and analyzed at a pixel level to find matches in the database, with reliability increasing correspondingly with the database's fingerprint sample size.

Acknowledging that white light tends to be absorbed by the outer layer of the skin, we utilized blue light at a wavelength of 500 nm to improve scan accuracy, achieving a correlation factor peak of 97.51%.

Our high-precision, contactless fingerprint scanner addresses the difficulty of maintaining finger positioning without physical contact. Previous setups required finger guides, risking infection through touch. Our solution surmounts motion blur and inconsistent image resolution issues common in unconstrained systems by using two infrared-proximity sensors coupled with a logic-controlled microcontroller that ensures non-touch finger alignment at an optimal distance from the scanning camera.
