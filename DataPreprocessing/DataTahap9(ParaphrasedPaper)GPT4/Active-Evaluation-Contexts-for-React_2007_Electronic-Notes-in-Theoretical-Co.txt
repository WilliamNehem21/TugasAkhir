In the field of process algebras, defining semantics typically involves a reaction relation along with a structural congruence relation. However, as process algebras have evolved to become more expressive in order to address the complex requirements of areas such as business modeling and systems biology, they have started to integrate features like general choice and parallelism that were once studied independently. This integration has made it challenging to formulate reaction semantics for these algebras.

This paper introduces a generalized method that employs active evaluation contexts to construct reaction semantics more efficiently. These contexts are an extension of standard evaluation contexts, which change when reactions take place.

Initially, the authors examine the Calculus of Communicating Systems (CCS) with guarded sums, as defined by Milner, focusing on the finite, recursion-free fragment to clarify their contributions. While their method excludes recursion in this part, they point out that it can be accommodated within their framework, as demonstrated later in the paper.

They discuss the trend of using process calculi to model complex real-world domains and the challenges that arise from increased expressiveness. The authors then compare their work to existing calculi like BioAmbients, which already employs reaction semantics (as proposed by Regev) to model bio-chemical processes. However, BioAmbients restricts external choice to guarded sums due to past limitations in combining parallelism with unrestricted choice.

To extend BioAmbients, this paper presents a variant with unrestricted choice, believed to be a conservative extension of the original calculus. While they do not provide a formal proof of this extension, the primary aim is to define reaction semantics using active evaluation contexts, demonstrating the viability of their approach.
