This paper discusses the significance of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in promoting human health and how it has garnered substantial attention in the food industry. The paper notes that various GABA-rich foods are accessible in the market, such as germinated brown rice, chocolate, and wine. It reminds us that for centuries, natural plants and products have been employed to combat numerous diseases, with recent ethnobotanical studies highlighting their efficacy, especially regarding central nervous system disorders.

The computational analysis for this study was conducted using Maestro v10.2 within the Schr√∂dinger suite, employing a range of integrated tools such as Prime for homology modeling, LigPrep for ligand preparation, SiteMap for binding site validation, grid generation for identifying target sites, and Glide XP for docking purposes. CentOS Linux served as the operating system for computational work.

SiteMap analysis identified potential active binding sites on the target molecule's inner and surface regions, and a specific site was chosen for further study based on its score and area size. This site was then prepared for grid generation.

Thirty-two ligand molecules were converted from 2D to 3D structures using the LigPrep tool, optimizing their geometries using the OPLS2005 force field. The ligands were also checked for different possible tautomeric and stereoisomeric forms.

The QuikProp tool of Maestro v10.2 analyzed the ligands' properties, such as their potential for hydrogen bonding, their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, and their effects on the central nervous system, following protocols by Katsila et al.

Structural validation was performed using a Ramachandran plot, which revealed that the majority of residues fell within favorable regions, confirming the accuracy of the model.

Docking analysis of the ligands into the target binding site involved considering side chain contacts with the ligands' functional groups. The study mentioned previous research that demonstrated good docking scores for an analog in acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzymes, which are important in various biological processes.

Curcumin, one of the ligands studied, achieved a significant docking score and made multiple contact points with the target protein, including hydrogen bonds and back chain contacts. Curcumin, known for its medicinal properties, has been shown to offer protective benefits for the liver, eyes, and lungs while exhibiting anti-leishmaniasis and anti-atherosclerotic activities.

The study found that curcumin displayed more favorable docking scores and binding affinities than mangiferin and other molecules, suggesting its potential therapeutic efficacy for conditions like epilepsy, corroborated by molecular docking approaches in various animal models.

Finally, the authors express gratitude to the DST-SERB for their financial support and to the management of A.V.V.M. Sri Pushpam College for providing the necessary facilities and support for the research.
