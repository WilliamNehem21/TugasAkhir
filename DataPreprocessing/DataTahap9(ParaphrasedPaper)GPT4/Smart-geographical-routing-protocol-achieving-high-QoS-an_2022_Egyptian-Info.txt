The Two-Phase Greedy Forwarding (TPGF) protocol, as reported in the literature, involves an initial phase where packets are forwarded to a next-hop node that is closer to the destination, thus exploring the path. If a forwarding node cannot find a suitable next-hop node, it returns the data to the sender and blocks itself, prompting a search for an alternative forwarding node. In the optimization phase, the destination sends packets back to the source along the established route with node and path identifiers to refine the path and reduce hop count. TPGF addresses issues with Greedy Perimeter Stateless Routing (GPSR) by preventing failure when the next-hop node is unavailable, but it can lead to circular routing and lost paths if nodes are blocked.

The SGFTEM protocol selects neighboring nodes for packet forwarding based on higher throughput and proximity to the destination, operating with only local knowledge of the network. Nodes with higher throughput lead to lower end-to-end delays (E2ED), packet loss, and energy consumption. In contrast to TPGF and AGEM, SGFTEM empirically achieves lower E2ED because it does not solely rely on the shortest path, which may consist of low-throughput nodes, potentially causing delays and packet loss. As the number of sensor nodes increases in AGEM, delays and losses can worsen due to a lack of global network knowledge.

AGEM slightly outperforms GPSR by seeking multiple routing paths for load balancing. SGFTEM prioritizes paths with lower traffic, reducing packet loss. However, all greedy routing protocols show high packet loss at dense network levels and are best suited for certain network sizes. Conversely, AODV works better in dense networks due to its global network information, providing an advantage in terms of low delay and energy efficiency. Although SGFTEM and AODV belong to different categories, their comparison highlights SGFTEM as the superior greedy protocol.

To further refine SGFTEM's energy management and load balancing, simulations were conducted in a homogeneous network. Nodes were deployed to match radio coverage and prolong sensor life across variable-sized rectangular fields, depending on the node count and deployment pattern. Fixed points on the field edges were designated for source and sink nodes, exemplifying a monitoring scenario with data packets sent from the source to the sink for external communication.

The maximum radio range (R) is considered, and for network construction, the sensing field is gridded with cell sizes determined to ensure coverage even if nodes fail during operation, thus supporting continuous routing and promoting energy saving.
