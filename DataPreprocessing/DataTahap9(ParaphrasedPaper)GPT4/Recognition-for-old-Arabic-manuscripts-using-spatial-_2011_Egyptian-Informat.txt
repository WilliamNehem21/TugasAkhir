This academic paper explores the use of texture analysis in the classification of old Arabic manuscripts into three historical periods: the modern age, Ottoman age, and Mamluk age. This segmentation-free approach hinges on a Spatial Gray-Level Dependence (SGLD) technique that delineates eight distinct texture features from each document. The paper discusses the effectiveness of Stepwise Discriminant Analysis and Multiple Discriminant Analysis to reduce feature dimensionality and derive training vectors. A Decision Tree classification method is then utilized to categorize documents into one of the three main historical periods. The system was tested on a set of 48 Arabic manuscripts from Dar Al-Kotob Almasria library, achieving a 95.83% accuracy rate.

The paper also acknowledges the increased interest in analyzing historical manuscripts from multiple languages and regions over the last decade, noting that such analysis supports researchers and librarians in editing, indexing, and archiving. It is particularly important for paleographers, providing objective insights for undated documents. Arabic manuscripts are highlighted as more complex than those in other languages due to both general degradation issues and linguistic specifics, such as cursive text and ornamental handwriting.

The study mentions that evaluations on a dataset of texts copied by 1,000 writers three times showed micro-features were more efficient than macro-features for identifying writers, surpassing an 80% success rate. When texture-level and allograph-level features are combined, very high performance in writer identification and verification is achieved, effective even with a dataset of 103 writers.
