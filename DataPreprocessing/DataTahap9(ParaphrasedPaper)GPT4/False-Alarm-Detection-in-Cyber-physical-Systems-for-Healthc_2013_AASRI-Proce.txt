Researchers previously addressed the limitations of existing Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) for healthcare but did not fully develop a comprehensive CPS architecture. A framework had been suggested to establish an automated, secure community cloud for more affordable healthcare services aimed at improved health outcomes. However, this framework did not resolve how to alert physicians during emergencies.

Separately, the common issue with independent threshold alarms in healthcare is the high frequency of alarms, which often include false alarms. Such false alarms can lead to caregiver fatigue. Therefore, a system that accommodates various types of sensors is necessary for a reliable CPS in healthcare. A method named 'tru-alarm,' inspired by strategies used in military contexts, was developed to identify credible alarms. This method estimates the location of objects triggering alarms, constructs an object-alarm graph, and infers trustworthiness using the graph's link information. Simulation results confirmed that this approach could effectively distinguish between actual and false alarms, thereby validating the importance of the alarms.

To further enhance the detection of trustworthy alarms and reduce false positives, an architecture was proposed that merged threshold alarms with a variety of classifiers within a decision-making framework. This architecture aimed to improve upon issues of completeness and accurately detect false alarms. By comparing the classifiers against patient vital signs, the system is designed to more accurately identify false alarms from medical sensors. Developers of this architecture expect improvements in accuracy, efficiency, and the creation of an intelligent alarm system. Future work includes addressing security concerns and implementing a prototype of this architecture in a real healthcare environment.
