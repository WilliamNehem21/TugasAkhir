This academic paper discusses the challenges faced when evaluating the performance of office desktops for centralized procurement, emphasizing the need for benchmarks that accurately reflect the user experience in practical office work conditions. In response, the authors introduce CPSMark+, a benchmark that assesses desktop performance through scenario-oriented workloads representative of cooperative office workflows. This system accounts for different task types and adapts metrics to align with user experiences.

CPSMark+ addresses the limitations of existing benchmarks like SYSmark 2018, critiquing their focus on CPU-intensive tasks and neglect of GPU and storage performance. The authors argue that benchmarks should reflect real office scenarios and user interactions more accurately.

The paper notes that traditional benchmarks often ignore the holistic user experience, focusing only on hardware specification comparisons. It encourages benchmarks to embody relevance, repeatability, fairness, and verifiability, while acknowledging a balance between specificity and general applicability is necessary.

The CPSMark+ benchmark utilizes API-level interactions for workload execution to avoid simulated user behaviors influencing performance evaluation. This approach allows for accurate execution of office-related tasks and realistic user experience measurement.

Results from CPSMark+ show sensitivity to different hardware components and high repeatability, with a coefficient of variation under 3%. The authors demonstrate CPSMark+'s effectiveness through a case study and emphasize the need to consider user experience ratings alongside price in procurement decisions. The new method showed that increased spending led to higher user experience ratings.

Lastly, the authors suggest that their approach to benchmark design could influence the procurement process and traditional bid evaluations, enhancing the focus on user experience. Future work may involve developing benchmarks for more complex interactions and additional metrics such as battery life or energy efficiency.
