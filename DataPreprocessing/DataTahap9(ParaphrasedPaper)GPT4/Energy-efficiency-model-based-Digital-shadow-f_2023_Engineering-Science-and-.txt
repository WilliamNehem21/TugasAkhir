To address these challenges, a Digital Twin (DT) is utilized to digitize the system and real-time (RT) monitor energy information from physical assets through a dynamic model. The creation of an energy efficiency model for a DT within the Industry 4.0 (i4.0) framework involves Data Science (DS), which is about collecting real-time, diverse energy data to enhance the energy consumption simulation across all connected loads. However, the varied types of energy data and poor communication hinder the adoption of energy-centric DT and DS in real industrial settings. Standardization of data collection is proposed, beginning with assessing the energy efficiency of individual machines.

An Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS)-based Induction Motor (IM) controller is detailed, focusing on dynamic and steady-state performance through torque control. Efforts to estimate Energy Consumption Parameters (ECPs) of IMs using ANFIS have been explored, comparing its performance against other neural network models. This study applies ANFIS for RT estimation of ECPs.

The paper is structured to highlight the researchâ€™s significance and innovations before reviewing relevant literature on DT implementation for induction motors in i4.0. The dynamic model's role in DT development and the energy efficiency (EE) model for DS application for induction motors are then discussed. The paper presents simulation results using MATLAB/Simulink to demonstrate energy monitoring through an optimal ANFIS model. Conclusions and future work ideas wrap up the paper.

The paper discusses measuring winding resistance in induction motors under varying temperatures and compares a proposed model's efficiency results with actual measurements from a 1.5 kW motor. Torque and losses monitored during simulations, and performance results from ANFIS algorithms, are shown to be effective.

A Neuro-Fuzzy Designer from MATLAB's toolbox is integrated into a Simulink block function to estimate ECPs in RT, leveraging both dynamic inputs like voltage, current, and power factor, and static inputs from manufacturer datasheets. Simulations are conducted for 1 second with speed control inputs, comparing the linear speed EE with actual measurements.

The paper addresses the use of Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) for laboratory demonstration and real-world industrial deployment. RT applications, characterized by pre-set time constraints for processing inputs and generating outputs, are essential for time-sensitive systems in industries.

Polynomial approximations are compared to simulated EE predictions, and the results align well with actual measurements, suggesting the model can inform better machine design and predictive maintenance. However, a limitation arises where certain industries cannot implement the model due to speed measurement challenges. Alternative speed measurement or estimation techniques, such as stroboscopic methods or sliding mode observers, are suggested to make the model more versatile for in-situ application.
