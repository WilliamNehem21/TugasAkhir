In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the use of internet and communication technologies (ICT) as a tool for ubiquitous communication, leading to the development of various applications and technologies that enable people to communicate anytime, anywhere. The internet has emerged as a vital resource globally, granting unrestricted access to information at all times and locations. Communication has been recognized as a key component in the educational process, with ICT contributing positively to its effectiveness and efficiency, facilitating collaborative learning and access to a wide array of content.

The paper then examines the impact of social media on business practices, addressing several aspects through a series of questions: the inconsistency in social media use for business purposes, a lack of interest in following business groups, limited time dedicated to social media for business activities, and a predominant use of social media for buying and selling. Concerns about normal shopping patterns and online shopping on social media were discussed, as well as widespread dissatisfaction with commercial advertisements. Some think that social media can effectively promote products, and users vary in their trust in the online shopping process.

The study reveals that students hold a generally positive attitude towards social media, showing great interest in its academic uses. However, many students prefer not to use it for business reasons and are skeptical of e-shopping replacing traditional shopping. While recognizing social media's potential to impact political events, the students show reluctance to engage in its political use. The authors argue for a concentration on the academic potential of social media, advocating for its development as a trustworthy educational platform. However, they also caution about the adverse health effects, such as addiction.

It's highlighted that Facebook remains the most popular social network, with YouTube showing significant prominence in academia, suggesting its potential for reliable academic use. The authors propose future research avenues including comparative studies across different societies and countries, as well as surveys involving faculty and employers, to enhance the quality of future research.
