This academic paper addresses the subtleties of interpreting the logic of ATL (Alternating-time Temporal Logic), specifically focusing on matters of knowledge, time, and strategic reasoning in various systems and game scenarios. The authors argue that for agents to have capabilities, it is not necessary for them to know specific strategies, diverging from previous notions that tie capabilities to known successful strategies. Moreover, the paper introduces the concept of strategic knowledge, which is the information agents possess due to being aware of the strategies they are executing.

To support these ideas, the authors provide a new interpretation of ATL applied to turn-based systems, which can also be adapted to concurrent systems. They suggest that agents within a coalition may choose a strategy that remains unbeaten by others, termed an undominated strategy, to achieve certain objectives.

The paper also explains the concept of "extensive games," which are detailed interactions among agents with varying objectives. Extensive games with imperfect information are modeled in game trees, where decisions lead to outcomes without clear knowledge of the current state.

Furthermore, game forms, a version of extensive games that lack preference functions, model interactions based on a common and known protocol, with private and non-communicable preferences among agents.

Strategic knowledge is obtained by assuming that all agents are aware of their own strategies, providing them with additional insights into possible future states. This approach aims to refine and broaden the understanding of strategic reasoning within ATL. Finally, the paper uses examples to demonstrate the interpretation issues and how notions like perfect recall and perfect memory can be incorporated into strategic reasoning.
