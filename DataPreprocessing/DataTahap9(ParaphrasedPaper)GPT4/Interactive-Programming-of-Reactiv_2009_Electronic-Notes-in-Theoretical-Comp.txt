This article introduces RMLtop, an interactive environment for ReactiveML programming, comparable to the OCaml toplevel. This environment enables programmers to dynamically type, compile, and load ReactiveML code. Users can orchestrate concurrent processes, monitoring their interaction as they evolve.

The core advantage of RMLtop is its capability to handle all valid ReactiveML expressions with the same meaning as when compiled. This feature makes the toplevel suitable as a debugging tool. Moreover, executed code via the toplevel is as fast as its compiled counterpart, and RMLtop's construction in ReactiveML itself lends to a lightweight design.

RMLtop takes ReactiveML code as input, compiles it, and executes it effectively by compiling it into bytecode. Unlike Esterel, which follows immediate signal semantics, ReactiveML operates on Boussinot semantics where signal absence reactions are deferred, ensuring program causality.

In an illustrative example, RMLtop simulates a universe where planets, represented by processes, emit and update their positions based on other planets' locations. The toplevel features a useful '#suspend' directive that allows processes to pause execution, such as when a planet aligns with the sun—an eclipse event. This creates an observer process that can impose "semantic breakpoints" defined within the ReactiveML language.

The underlying Reactive machine and its controller operate on a separate thread, sharing the OCaml toplevel environment, and interact through shared memory and locks to prevent race conditions. Various directives modify the execution environment, managed by control references in the 'rmltop_global' module.

Machine_controller operates in two modes: sampled or step-by-step, responding to signals like 'suspend,' 'resume,' and 'step' to regulate the computation of new instants. Translation of directives into ReactiveML signals is also managed by the controller by monitoring and responding to changes in shared variables.

Given RMLtop's architecture, not only does it accept legitimate ReactiveML expressions, but it also preserves semantic and efficiency standards similar to the compiled form. Additionally, the design addresses limitations present in Esterel's semantics—ReactiveML allows for the dynamic addition of processes without causing non-causal loops.

The paper also discusses the 'killable process' feature, which supervises process execution and can interrupt it based on certain conditions. Another feature includes a join-definition, which outlines the behavior of a buffer through reaction rules.

In conclusion, RMLtop is presented as a valuable tool for designing, debugging, and teaching reactive systems, offering flexibility in program execution. Its unique aspect is the self-coding in ReactiveML, highlighting the benefits and advocating for future language enhancements like asynchronous tasks.
