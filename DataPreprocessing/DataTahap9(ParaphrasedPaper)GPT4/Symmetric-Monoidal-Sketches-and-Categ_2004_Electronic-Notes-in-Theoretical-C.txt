In the paper under discussion, the authors explore the application of two-dimensional linear algebra concepts to the field of concurrency, with a focus on wiring categories as used in various models of concurrency, such as action calculi. They develop the idea of symmetric monoidal sketches—an abstract framework to represent wiring categories—and explain how these sketches can give rise to generic models of concurrency. If a sketch is single-sorted, its associated generic model can be described as a free structure based on a single element, with the structure specified in a coalgebraic fashion.

The paper examines how the presented ideas extend the earlier work on categories of wirings, such as those presented by Milner and colleagues. Moreover, it discusses the structural aspects of wiring categories through category theory. A central point in action calculus is how composition within the action category models data-flow and how tensor product signifies parallel composition. Operations such as copying data and discarding it are intrinsic to parallel composition, with symmetry being a fundamental property.

The authors delve into more advanced category theory by describing the definition of strict monoidal categories, which includes a monoid of the category's objects and the concept of a commutative monoid within a symmetric strict monoidal category. The paper then defines the notion of a model in this context and what constitutes a map of models, proposing a category M ODS(S, C) for these structures.

The core contribution of the paper highlights not only the aspect of freeness in their constructions but also the idea of cofreeness, which is characteristic of linear algebra as opposed to universal algebra more broadly. Cofreeness is associated with coalgebraic structures, indicating a unique and significant attribute of the algebraic systems being investigated in the context of concurrency theory. The authors suggest potential extensions of their constructs to better model controls and dynamics in concurrent systems.
