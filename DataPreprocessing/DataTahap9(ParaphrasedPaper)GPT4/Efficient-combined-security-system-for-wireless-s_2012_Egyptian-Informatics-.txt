This paper introduces a hybrid security system that integrates Kerberos and ECMQV protocols to bolster network security and enhance energy efficiency. Additionally, this system accelerates network operation by reducing the necessary communication and computational load. The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 reviews related studies, focusing on a lightweight Kerberos protocol with concise messages and ECMQV. Section 3 outlines the proposed combined security system, emphasizing its suitability for wireless sensor networks. Section 4 compares the performance of the proposed system against the individual protocols. The paper concludes in Section 5.

In the context of sensor networks, nodes establish a shared secret key after deployment through either key transport or key agreement methods. Key transport involves a single entity generating or obtaining a secret key and securely transferring it to others, whereas key agreement allows all entities to contribute random inputs to jointly derive the secret key, ensuring that no single entity can predetermine the outcome.

Each entity maintains its own private keys and is cognizant of a set of public keys. Using these keys, entities calculate a shared secret key through a defined algorithm. In a wireless sensor network organized into clusters, each cluster has a coordinator responsible for management tasks, data collection from nodes, and data forwarding to a central sink, requiring a higher energy budget than regular nodes. Energy analysis of the Kerberos protocol is based on the premise that direct communication is possible between entity A and a trusted third party T, which is feasible in small networks but not in expansive ones with dispersed nodes. The energy cost of communication in Kerberos is influenced by the power transmission level and the number of intervening nodes in the path from A to T, as multi-hop transmissions raise the overall energy consumption due to intermediate nodes relaying messages.

The combined system generates multiple advantages, as confirmed by experimental results. However, switching between protocols at layer 2, where Kerberos is used for communication with layer 1 and ECMQV for intra-layer 2 communications as well as between layers 2 and 3, imposes some load on layer 2. Despite this, the benefits of power savings and security enhancement justify the approach.

In summary, the paper proposes a security system merging lightweight Kerberos and ECMQV protocols, aiming to improve energy efficiency and security. This system lowers energy consumption by minimizing communications and computations, thereby speeding up the network. Experimental results confirm that the new system reduces overall energy consumption compared to using either lightweight Kerberos or ECMQV alone, as demonstrated with a WINS sensor node's energy characteristics.
