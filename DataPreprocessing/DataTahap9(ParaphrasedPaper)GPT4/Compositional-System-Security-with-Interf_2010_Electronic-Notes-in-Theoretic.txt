The paper discusses a structural framework for analyzing and ensuring the security of systems through compositional reasoning. This approach views systems as composed of various components, each with its own interfaces that interact with each other. Security is achieved by limiting adversaries to the interfaces they can access while being able to combine calls to these interfaces in unrestricted ways.

Compositional reasoning in this context extends rely-guarantee methods, typically used for correctness, to scenarios where adversaries are involved, without precise knowledge of their programs. The paper introduces a concurrent programming language with recursion for modeling system interfaces and a logic for compositional reasoning, with formal rules shown to be sound through trace semantics. Security methods are exemplified through an example of an idealized file system.

Securing composite systems is challenging due to possible unforeseen interactions between secure components that might be exploited by adversaries. While some progress has been made in specific areas, such as information flow control and cryptographic protocols, a general understanding of secure system composition is lacking.

The paper builds upon and extends previous work in logics for network protocol analysis and secure systems, using interface-level abstractions to build systems and model adversaries. Different actions can be modularly factored into the model, making it broadly applicable across a variety of systems.

An in-depth formalism for system modeling and program logic is laid out, covering both specifying security properties and reasoning about them. It includes a concurrent programming language framework, a hands-on example, and a logic that allows expression of temporal security properties. This logic offers enhanced expressiveness, aiding in modular reasoning about programs and supporting rely-guarantee reasoning.

The paper further presents a proof system for establishing program assertions and security properties, utilizing invariants and defining trusted versus adversarial threads. It emphasizes reasoning about unknown adversary behaviors by limiting them to certain interfaces, with rules to establish invariants and prove thread properties based on program knowledge.

The approach is exemplified through various examples, showcasing how to prove properties of both trusted threads and adversaries. It also highlights how past security properties can impact the reasoning process for current and future properties.

Overall, the paper advances towards a foundational approach to compositional security, planning to extend the work to higher-order programs and apply the framework to web security, hoping to systematically understand and counteract web-based security threats.
