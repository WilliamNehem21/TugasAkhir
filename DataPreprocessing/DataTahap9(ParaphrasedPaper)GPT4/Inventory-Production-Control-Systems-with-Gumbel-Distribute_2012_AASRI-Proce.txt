This paper focuses on the optimization of inventory-production systems that are influenced by the deterioration of items following a Gumbel distribution, by applying optimal control theory. The authors successfully establish the problem as a linear optimal control model and provide a clear solution by applying Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. They provide the necessary conditions for the solution to be considered optimal. To demonstrate the utility of their findings, they present examples.

The study expands on existing research by looking at the dynamic elements of inventory management, such as item deterioration and changes in demand over time. Previous research typically assumed constant deterioration rates, but this paper investigates the more complex scenario where deterioration follows a Gumbel distribution, known for modeling extreme values, which can also be applied to natural phenomena such as floods, wind gusts, earthquakes, and other events. The numerical examples provided showcase how the optimal control approach can guide production-inventory decisions in systems with items whose deterioration can be described by extreme value distributions like the Gumbel distribution.
