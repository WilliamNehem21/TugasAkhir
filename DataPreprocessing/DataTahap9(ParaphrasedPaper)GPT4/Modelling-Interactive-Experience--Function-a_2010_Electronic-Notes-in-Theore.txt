The underlying system's automatic responses are influenced by various conditions, including whether a person carries a mobile device, its features, and others present in the setting. For instance, the Match system is built to provide assistance to individuals with specific needs. If the system identifies a potential harmful event, the reaction depends on the context: It stays inactive if a carer is present in the same room, alerts the carer in the house through sound or mobile message depending on ambient conditions, or informs a remote surveillance center if the carer is off-site.

A category of ubiquitous systems is used for analyzing user-related attributes of systems designed to improve buildings by offering guidance to occupants. Examples include a navigation system and a system to aid hospital out-patients. Various instructions are displayed according to the number of people in a space and its capacity.

The hospital system assists patients by updating them on wait times and guiding them through their appointments. Depending on whether patients have mobile devices, information can be sent directly to them, or else they use a sensor/visitor card for coordination with public displays providing wait times and directions.

Both systems share traits: individuals need to reach destinations, and information provision is context-dependent. People act on this information, changing their context.

Users’ satisfaction or anxiety can be affected not only by system properties but also by external factors and personal expectations. To make progress, system designs must integrate both familiar usability-related factors and novel human-computer interaction considerations.

Implicit interaction in systems can focus on individuals or on group behavior. For a model to be useful in design, it must have a formative value, enabling exploration of design impacts and comparison between alternatives before deployment. While the technical analysis should be made accessible to those focused on human factors, it should visually represent the design.

The paper introduces a PEPA (Performance Evaluation Process Algebra) specification—a stochastic model—to evaluate the system's behavior. This helps refine designs through further iterations. The paper does not delve into the details of PEPA but rather focuses on combining a functional model with stochastic analysis for competent design use.

The model assesses various visitor types with specified destinations managed by an arbitrator, which opens new slots as available via a slot manager. The study analyzes a small sample of 400 visitors with different starting and ending points.

The challenges include determining the applicability of this model for analysis and its relevance to the properties discussed earlier. The analysis allows adjustment of design parameters such as display size and visible slots, assisting with congestion management and path utilization to support design optimization.

The study concludes by highlighting stochastic model checking's preliminary role in understanding environmental characteristics that influence user experiences. This abstract modeling approach complements previous qualitative methods, but both aim to verify and refine collective behavior within systems.
