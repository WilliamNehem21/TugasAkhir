This academic paper introduces a novel approach to the application of Bounded Model Checking (BMC) by utilizing a symbolic representation of Kripke structures. Traditional discussions around BMC often mingle the process of translating Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) into propositional logic with an explanation of its semantics, only casually mentioning the possible symbolic forms Kripke structures could take. In contrast, the authors propose a methodology that delineates the translation process from the semantics, which they believe improves comprehension, despite being more wordy, particularly in the context of auxiliary variables that their translation introduces.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 lays out the basics of the authors' representational method, mirroring the logic behind the original BMC translation process. Section 3 provides an overview of their new translation approach, which is divided into two steps: normalization (discussed in Section 4) and the translation into propositional logic (covered in Section 5). Section 6 examines related work in the field, and the paper concludes with Section 7.

The original translation is analogous to just the second step of the authors' method, omitting the first and third steps. Despite optimization efforts, it's noted that the original translation's size can be cubic in the worst-case scenario. The authors' initial normalization process enables a more efficient translation later on that can achieve linear size.

The paper also critiques a previous work in the BMC field, which utilized fixpoint characterizations in its translation but did not maintain a linear encoding size with respect to the bound and suffered from soundness issues. The authors posit that such issues could have been averted if the translation had been developed within a formal framework, such as the one they are presenting.

The paper in question is "Bounded Verification of Past LTL," authored by Alessandro Cimatti, Marco Roveri, and Danny Sheridan, and was presented at the 5th International Conference on Formal Methods in Computer-Aided Design (FMCAD 2004), as part of the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.
