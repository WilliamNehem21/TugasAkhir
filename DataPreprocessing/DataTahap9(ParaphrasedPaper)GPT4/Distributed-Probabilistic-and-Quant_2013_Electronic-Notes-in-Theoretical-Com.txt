Current research is exploring concurrent strategies as a potential foundation for a universal theory in the realm of domains, positioning concurrent games and strategies in roles traditionally held by domains and continuous functions. The goal is to extend the scope of denotational semantics by incorporating these elements. An important aspect of this work is to understand how concurrent strategies can be adapted to encompass quantitative, probabilistic, and quantum semantics.

Just as event structures are viewed as models for distributed computations, probabilistic event structures serve as models for probabilistic distributed processes. However, the existing definitions of probabilistic event structures lack the generality required to assign probabilities to the interactions between strategies, which may be partial. This paper introduces a new comprehensive definition of probabilistic event structures that builds upon previous models, characterizing them as event structures with a continuous valuation on their domain.

In quantum games, players and opponents engage in a joint probabilistic distributed experiment on a quantum system, with quantum strategies being analogous to distributed probabilistic strategies on a quantum event structure. This concept aligns with existing research on quantum games and shares similarities with Delbecque's work, which is grounded in probabilistic Ho games.

The paper also acknowledges that without knowing the stochastic rates of players and opponents, it is impossible to assign probabilities to the outcomes of games that involve races, or immediate conflicts between competing moves. To address probabilistic strategies, the study focuses on games that are free of such races.

In Blackwell games, for instance, total strategies correspond with the traditional strategies used in this context. The paper discusses the benefits of symmetry in games, noting that it facilitates game analysis by potentially reducing the number of scenarios that need to be examined. Additionally, symmetry can mitigate the overly-specific nature of event structures when representing games, as it supports the application of operations on games that are neither monads nor comonads.
