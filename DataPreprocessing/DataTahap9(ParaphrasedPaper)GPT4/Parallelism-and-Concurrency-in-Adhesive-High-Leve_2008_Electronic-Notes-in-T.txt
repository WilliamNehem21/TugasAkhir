This paper aims to extend established theories of parallelism and concurrency in adhesive high-level replacement (HLR) systems to include systems that incorporate negative application conditions (NACs). NACs are constraints that prevent the application of transformation rules if specified structures are present. These conditions can have significant impacts on the behavior and properties of HLR systems.

Highlights of this paper include:

1. The concept of adhesive HLR systems with NACs introduces NACs into the transformation modeling process, providing greater model expressiveness by stipulating that certain structures must not exist within a given context for transformations to take place. New classes of morphisms are introduced to adapt the theory to include these conditions effectively.

2. This research focuses solely on adhesive HLR categories, which are slightly different from weak adhesive HLR categories. The results presented, however, are also valid for weak adhesive HLR categories with NACs, such as Petri net transformations that use NACs.

3. Additional morphism classes are necessary to generalize results within an adhesive HLR category with NACs. The paper outlines specific classes called M, M', Q, and a class of morphism pairs known as E'. Each class must fulfill certain properties to support the theoretical framework.

4. The main outcomes of this study are the generalized Local Church-Rosser Theorem, Parallelism Theorem, and Concurrency Theorem â€” all adapted to account for the presence of NACs. By introducing a new necessary morphism class Q, the research ensures these results on parallelism and concurrency can be applied to all transformation systems with NACs within the adhesive HLR framework.

5. The paper also sets the stage for future research, such as refining the new results, determining their practical applications, and developing effective analysis algorithms dealing with NACs in transformation systems.

Overall, the aforementioned results build on the adhesive HLR framework to support formal analysis techniques in transformation systems implementing NACs, extending the scope of algebraic graph transformation theory.
