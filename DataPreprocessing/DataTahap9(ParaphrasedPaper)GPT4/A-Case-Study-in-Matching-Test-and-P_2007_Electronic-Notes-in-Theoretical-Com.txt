This academic paper examines how combining testing and deductive proof methods can improve the verification of Java programs annotated in the Java Modeling Language (JML). The paper acknowledges that proving a program's correctness can be challenging, with automatic provers sometimes failing to confirm theorems. When this happens, it is not immediately clear if the theorem is incorrect or if there is not enough information for the proof. 

To distinguish between these possibilities, the authors employ testing techniques. They introduce their experiments with the JACK tool to prove Java programs featuring JML assertions. When JACK cannot resolve a proof obligation, the authors use the combinatorial testing tool TOBIAS to generate extensive test suites targeting the parts of the program that have not been proven.

The core challenge is assessing the relevance of the tests to the unproved proof obligations. This is tackled through code coverage techniques, comparing the statements involved in the unproved proof obligations to those exercised by the tests. They also assess the test suites' effectiveness by executing them on "mutant" versions of the program - modified programs designed to test the ability of the test suite to detect introduced errors.

The authors demonstrate their approach with a simple case study, showing how the use of JACK and TOBIAS can guide a validation engineer away from wasting time on unprovable or false proof obligations.

Further on, the paper describes a real-world application of their techniques in a modestly sized (500 lines of code) software project involving monetary transactions. Defining testing schemas was straightforward, and uncovered failures related to only one class. However, not all classes had mutants that were killed by the test suite, indicating that some test schemas were insufficiently comprehensive.

The paper concludes by discussing the potential improvements of using path coverage instead of statement coverage, the value of a fully automatic testing process, and the usefulness of integrating assertions generated from test cases back into the proof process, creating a feedback loop that enhances both testing and proving methods. 

The authors assert their belief in the practicality of their approach, and suggest that while the initial setup and design of test schemas may take some time, the payoff comes in the form of increased confidence in a program's correctness, and a reduction in the time and effort spent on manual, interactive proof activities.
