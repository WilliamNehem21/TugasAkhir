The polymorphic instance defines the number of samples per symbol necessary for the pulse-shaping filter, which shapes the waveform of the digital signal. This value must be an even number greater than 2 and be consistent with the 'samples per symbol' setting of the system parameters cluster when using demodulation. The matched filter also requires a number of samples per symbol that matches the system parameters and is utilized for demodulation to minimize interference between symbols.

Filter coefficients are subsequently determined for the pulse-shaping filter to manage the modulation process by limiting bandwidth and for the demodulation process to cut down on inter-symbol interference. These coefficients are arranged in a sequence that reflects the desired filter response. While the pulse-shaping filter serves a dual role in both transmission and demodulation (for FSK modulated signals), the matched filter is exclusively for demodulation. The impulse response of the filter, which determines these coefficients, is calculated using specific formulas.

By employing LabVIEW, an interactive, software-defined radio system was developed more efficiently than with conventional text-based programming languages. Through this system, it was demonstrated that data errors could be reduced by applying coding techniques, thus enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Comparing two types of error correction codes—turbo coding and convolutional coding—it was observed that turbo coding significantly lowers the likelihood of data errors. Additionally, as the number of signal levels (M) increases at the receiver's end, turbo coding continues to outperform convolutional coding, ensuring signal recovery with a very low error probability.
