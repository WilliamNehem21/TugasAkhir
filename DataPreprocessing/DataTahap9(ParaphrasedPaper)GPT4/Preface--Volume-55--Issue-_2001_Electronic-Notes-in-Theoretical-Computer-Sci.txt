The increasing recognition of model checking as an essential tool for verifying hardware, coupled with the complexities involved in creating error-free software, has sparked a surge in interest in applying model checking techniques to software systems. This intersection has generated numerous scientific and practical challenges that extend to enhancing core model checking methods as well as developing supplementary techniques, such as program analysis and transformations. These additional techniques aim to automate the abstraction process for data states and to simplify the control state space.

The workshop focused on two primary objectives: to introduce attendees to the realm of software model checking and to create a platform for sharing and discussing innovative research ideas within this domain.

In response to the call for papers, the workshop received 25 submissions. The program committee carefully reviewed these submissions, selecting eight for presentation during the workshop. Out of these, seven are included in the relevant proceedings. The review process involved not only the program committee but also additional reviewers, namely Dennis Dams, Alex Groce, Frederic Lang, Radu Mateescu, Seungjoon Park, and Sriram Rajamani.
