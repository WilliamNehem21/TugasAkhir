Analyzing the costs associated with deploying networks that can support the vast array of devices making up the Internet of Things (IoT) is crucial due to the diversity of IoT devices which require a range of specialized network behaviors. Traditional approaches utilized specialized hardware for network functions, but such devices needed strategic placement within the network.

Virtualization of network functions offers a solution by allowing the remote programming of network elements through a standardized interface. Network elements become software-defined, their roles easily reconfigured, automating network operations and reducing the need for specialized hardware. This transition enables businesses to focus on their core operations without the burden of managing network infrastructure.

The proposed future networks aim to simplify the creation and management of virtualized networks. They allow for dynamic adjustments in network topology and resources, mitigating issues of over- or under-provisioning.

Another approach is to separate the control plane from hardware, advocating for general-purpose devices that focus solely on data forwarding, with control mechanisms managed by separate software. This supports multitenancy in cloud networks, where applications share the same infrastructure while maintaining isolation and performance.

Data from IoT devices and social media are expected to dominate in the future. The integrity and accessibility of this data are critical, as the success of data analytics relies heavily on the availability and transfer speed of relevant data to enable timely decision-making.

The virtual network function (VNF) architecture comprises three main components: physical hardware hosting resources, a virtual hypervisor layer that manages these resources, and virtual machines that emulate physical platforms and share resources.

Using commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) servers for VNF and Software-Defined Networking (SDN) promises to revolutionize big data processing and cellular network architectures, potentially reducing costs and energy consumption. However, the performance of such networks remains to be tested through experimental trials.

Comparisons of cost and energy consumption between different technologies, like SDN/NFV networks and legacy 4G networks, are complex. Although industry insights suggest new COTS servers are more efficient and powerful, empirical evidence is needed to validate claims about cost-effectiveness and energy savings.
