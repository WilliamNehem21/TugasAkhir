The academic paper discusses advancements in microseismic signal processing, with a focus on noise reduction as a key aspect of data enhancement. Microseismic signals are typically weaker than ordinary seismic signals and are prone to being overwhelmed by noise, leading to a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This complicates the direct extraction of accurate arrival times and event locations from raw observational data.

Efforts to mitigate noise and boost the precision of microseismic data interpretation have led to the development of various denoising methods. These include techniques based on domain transform algorithms and thresholding, such as wavelet transform, continuous wavelet transform (CWT), short-time Fourier transform (STFT), the S-transform, the Radon transform, and wavelet packet transform.

In this paper, the authors introduce a new noise reduction approach utilizing the CBDNet neural network specifically geared toward surface microseismic monitoring denoising. Unlike traditional deep learning models, this method concurrently tackles a variety of noises, namely Gaussian random noise, wind noise, construction noise, traffic noise, and mixed noise. It does so by implementing a residual learning strategy. This not only improves the SNR but also offers broader applicability and maintains signal integrity.

The training of the network involved preparing 300,000 samples, of which 20% were set aside for validation, where noise types were superimposed onto signals to enhance the generalization capabilities of the network.

The paper presents results comparing the new method with traditional techniques, indicating improved average similarity coefficients and mean square error rates, suggesting the CBDNet based method is effective in diverse noise situations. Consequently, this approach can effectively reduce a range of noise types in the field, while ensuring the denoising performance adapts to various types of noise encountered.
