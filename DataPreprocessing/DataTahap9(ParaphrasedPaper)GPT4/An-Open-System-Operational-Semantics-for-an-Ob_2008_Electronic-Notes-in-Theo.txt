The article discusses the Creol interpreter, which is designed for simulating a closed distributed system, a system where all components are predetermined. However, the interpreter restricts execution of any component unless an interactive environment is supplied. To overcome this limitation at the reasoning level, the Hoare logic by Dovland et al. is applied. Hoare logic proves the persistence of invariants within a class, and by applying compositional rules, these invariants can be extended to uphold across the entire system. These invariants emulate a theoretical communication history that logs object creation and method invocations within the system.

The paper focuses on the class structure of Creol, ignoring additional features such as interface, inheritance, self-reentrance, dynamic updates, as well as typing and specification. The discussion is restricted to Creol's essential communication and synchronization framework, yet this approach could also be applicable to other languages that utilize message passing or method interaction for communication. It is presupposed that Creol programs are syntactically and type-wise accurate.

The paper is organized with the following structure: Section 2 examines Creol's main syntactic statements. Section 3 details the operational semantics for handling a closed system within the core language. Section 4 introduces semantics for open systems, linking them back to closed system semantics and Hoare logic. Section 5 surveys work related to this field. Section 6 summarizes the contents of the paper.

The paper also acknowledges that some presented rules involve variables that are absent on their left-hand side, making them unsuitable for direct testing or simulation of a Creol component. One proposed workaround is altering the rewrite rules to accept input data alongside the Creol program. Alternatively, a custom evaluation strategy could be devised in Maude, a high-performance logical framework, to instantiate these unbound variables with randomly generated data.
