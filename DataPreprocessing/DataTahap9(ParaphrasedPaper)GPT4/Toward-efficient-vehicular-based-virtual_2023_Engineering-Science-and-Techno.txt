In current research, there is a strong focus on advancing 5G network technologies to offer ubiquitous and dependable internet access for Internet of Things (IoT) devices, which is quite crucial for the functionality of smart cities. Yet, delivering coverage via high-frequency spectrum presents difficulties, such as inadequate propagation, particularly in urban areas. Thus, smaller-scale network infrastructure, known as micro infrastructure, is seen as a future solution for 5G to enhance capacity and improve coverage cost-efficiently. Non-cellular configurations are also under consideration for their capacity to integrate connections into the radio access network part.

This paper introduces the concept of employing intelligent vehicles to form an efficient virtual network infrastructure in smart cities. Smart vehicles will assume the role of network constructors, enabling connectivity for ubiquitous city devices, and providing internet access. The paper is structured as follows: section 2 reviews related work, section 3 describes the proposed framework, section 4 outlines the problem statement, and sections 5 and 6 delve into the theoretical model, design, and processing of the network infrastructure. Section 7 demonstrates performance results affirming the efficiency of the infrastructure, and section 8 concludes.

There's broad consensus on the inadequacy of existing wireless networks to support the burgeoning number of IoT devices in smart cities, hindered by limited computation and spectrum resources. Recent innovations like ultra-dense networking and mobile edge computing offer solutions by boosting network capacity and bringing resources closer to IoT devices. However, these technologies face challenges like interference due to cell density and limited radio resources.

Exploiting connected vehicles as infrastructures for computation and communication is considered technically viable. Vehicles can deliver various services, and when combined in vehicular cloud networking, they can provide security, monitoring, and virtualization services. The integration of different wireless technologies enables vehicles to communicate within a heterogeneous network that could contribute to tomorrowâ€™s ICT systems.

This article suggests that intelligent vehicles not only provide services but act as centralized communication nodes in smart cities. A two-part framework is proposed, with smart vehicles as service providers, maintaining networks, and offering access and connectivity. Vehicles also serve as gateways for user entities, such as IoT devices.

Each smart vehicle should be equipped with a multi-network onboard unit to be part of the network. The selection of the best vehicle for network stability and minimal cost is modelled as a multi-attribute decision-making problem, taking into account different criteria including efficiency, availability, and cost.

Performance results show that increased vehicle density and transmission range can enhance network uptime and throughput, while higher vehicle velocity can reduce throughput due to frequent changes in the network infrastructure manager (VIM). Traffic offloading tests measured the percentage of data traffic diverted from the cellular network to the VVNI, revealing potential improvements in network performance.

The paper concludes that while relying on connected vehicles alone may not be entirely viable, they can significantly support ICT in smart cities when used with other technologies. The study indicates that for the VVNI to achieve its full potential, ongoing research and development are required to seamlessly integrate the technology into city infrastructure.
