In this paper, the authors address the challenge of recognizing human actions in realistic videos where similar actions can be hard to distinguish due to complex backgrounds. To overcome this, they present an innovative action-scene model that learns the contextual relationship between actions and scenes in videos without needing to identify specific scene categories. This approach uses a generative probabilistic framework that directly infers actions from background visual cues with minimal prior knowledge.

The model automatically segments videos into person and background regions and then calculates the relationship between action categories and scenes. It uses a generative model to represent actions and scenes from visual features, with the model treating each video as a mixture of action categories, associated scenes, and visual word distributions.

Experiments performed on a realistic video dataset, consisting of 11 different action classes across numerous scenes, demonstrate that the proposed model effectively improves action recognition accuracy by incorporating contextual scene information. The research shows that the action-scene model is robust even when features are noisy, suggesting its potential for practical applications like video surveillance and content management. Future work will likely focus on further enhancing model robustness and exploring additional applications.
