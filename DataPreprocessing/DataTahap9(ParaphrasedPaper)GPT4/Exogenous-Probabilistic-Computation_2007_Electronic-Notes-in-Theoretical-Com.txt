The paper discusses a logic language with two tiers of formulas: classical formulas for dealing with propositional symbols, and probabilistic state formulas for engaging with probabilistic structures. Additionally, the language includes probability terms to represent real numbers. The syntax of this language is described using BNF notation. 

The paper's findings are based on an earlier established axiomatization for a broader logic framework, suggesting that the EPPL logic introduced in the paper is a subset and inherits soundness and weak completeness properties. The reader is referred to previous work for more detailed information.

The structure of the logic is noteworthy as it reflects ideas from probabilistic transition systems research, where states are distributions over classical states. This concept also moves towards accommodating reasoning about quantum systems that comprise probabilistic combinations of pure quantum states.

Further along, it is explained how to adapt the syntax of another logic, EPCTL, from EPPL by introducing CTL modalities into probabilistic state formulas. This integration maintains clarity by revisiting the definitions of classical formulas and probability terms.

An example involving Russian roulette demonstrates the use of the language to express conditions related to temporal sequences and probabilities. In this scenario, one could specify that the gun cannot fire until a coin shows heads. This serves to illustrate how the probability of an event, such as the gambler killing himself, can asymptotically approach certainty if the game is played continuously.

The paper notes that for the basic modality, using EG could lead to a better algorithm than using AF, even though both result in exponential complexity in the worst-case scenario. These algorithms presume that probability distributions over valuations are given as vectors. However, the paper recognizes that more efficient and compact encodings are possible and mentions ongoing research to determine which probability distributions permit such encodings.
