In the referenced academic paper, the concept of generalization (also known as anti-unification) is contrasted with unification. Generalization involves finding a common term, denoted as t'', from two given terms t and t', such that both t and t' can be derived from t'' through substitution. The authors explain that the least general generalization (LGG) is comparable to the most general unifier (MGU) in that it serves as a baseline from which any other generalization can be derived.

This paper expands upon previous work in untyped generalization, advancing it to accommodate an order-sorted typed framework that incorporates elements like sorts, subsorts, and subtype polymorphism. Unlike in the untyped scenario where a single LGG exists, in this typed context, there are a finite, minimal group of LGGs. Any other generalization is at least a substitution instance of one of the LGGs in this group.

To describe the generalization process, the authors eschew a traditional algorithmic approach in favor of an inference system, which has advantages both in explanation and in conceptual clarity. They claim their system is novel even in the context of untyped generalization. The paper proceeds to extend the inference rules developed for the untyped case to their new order-sorted algorithms and provides examples to demonstrate how these rules are applied. The inference system's correctness is also formally proven.

The implications of this work are significant for fields utilizing typed reasoning systems and typed rule-based languages, such as ASF+SDF, ELAN, OBJ, CafeOBJ, and Maude, with potential applications in partial evaluation, program synthesis, and theorem proving.
