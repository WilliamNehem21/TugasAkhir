The study's findings demonstrate that the algorithm can effectively distinguish authentic finger vein images from non-vein images, such as those of pencils. The dataset consisted of images from 40 distinct fingers, with some fingers being photographed up to 70 times, resulting in a collection of 588 images that constituted the vein image database.
