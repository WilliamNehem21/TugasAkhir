Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) such as IoT devices and embedded sensors are increasingly integrated into various settings, making them common targets for significant cyberattacks that can cause widespread system disruptions, also referred to as gridlock or BlackIoT. This paper describes a method for modeling and evaluating the impact of cyberattacks, particularly botnet attacks, on smart grid power management systems using Continuous-Time Markov Chains (CTMCs). The researchers simulate scenarios where power suppliers, like power plants, are attacked by botnets, analyzing how different types of power plants (hydro, gas, nuclear) respond to demand surges caused by these attacks. The study also explores strategies for reducing the success of attacks and suggests optimum power plant usage to withstand the effects of excessive load.

The paper begins by explaining how CPS encompass computing and physical elements that work together in highly interconnected environments, such as smart homes or healthcare devices. The organization of the paper includes sections on cybersecurity concerns, system modeling, results, and considerations for future work.

The paper highlights the importance of self-regulating power supplies in smart infrastructures and the potential for targeted attacks to overpower these systems. The authors present their stochastic model for smart infrastructure managers to assess and address these threats. They compare their approach with a previous study that simulated coordinated botnet attacks but focus on quantifying the potential impacts from a power supplier's perspective.

The paper's modeling considers different states of power supply and demand, responsive control strategies, and the attacker's capabilities. Different types of energy suppliers are shown to have varying resilience to attacks based on their response rates, with faster-responsive power plants like gas plants being better at mitigating the effects of an attack. The paper discusses scenarios under different demand conditions and the implications of successful attacks on the power grid.

Finally, the researchers propose extending their model to include more varied attack patterns, costs and rewards for certain states, additional power sources, and scaling the model for different types of CPS and their energy needs. This extension would help evaluate the effectiveness of new security measures and manage the power grid more efficiently in the face of cyber threats.
