We propose a novel multi-modal logic framework for analyzing and understanding states of ignorance within multi-agent systems (MAS). Recognizing that reasoning about agents' ignorance is equally critical as considering their knowledge, we present a rigorous logical system to characterize what agents do not know. This framework is rooted in sound and complete axiomatic principles.

Previous research over the last two decades has largely focused on formalizing agents' knowledge and beliefs in MAS, based on foundations laid in artificial intelligence and philosophical logic from as early as the 1950s by thinkers like Hintikka, Aumann, Bratman, and Cohen. The current usage of these theories has evolved significantly, incorporating advancements from software engineering, particularly in verification techniques.

Despite leveraging established theories, there is potential for MAS to benefit from exploring underutilized concepts. We posit that one such concept is ignorance, and our paper contends that this area stemming directly from MAS research could be significant.

We refine the understanding of ignorance beyond the simple absence of knowledge and further demonstrate the utility of this concept by revisiting the notion of 'inform' as defined by FIPA (Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents) in the context of our logical framework.

The paper provides a detailed formal approach to characterizing ignorance and its relationship with knowledge, constructing a canonical model based on maximal consistent sets of formulas for our proposed logic of ignorance (IG). Although this model construction is unconventional, we rely on familiar definitions of logical consistency and maximal consistent sets for support.

We investigate the relationship between our construct of ignorance and the established frameworks in epistemic logic, exploring the possibility of expressing ignorance in terms of knowledge. We argue that our results offer new perspectives on crafting modal operators that deviate from mainstream modal logic's common practice of defining operators on the set of accessible points.

We conclude that our findings pave the way for further exploration in MAS, particularly in the field of security, where our logic could enhance the understanding of protocol security by ensuring an agent's state of ignorance remains unaltered, a critical aspect yet to be addressed by existing formalisms like BAN logic. This could potentially provide the semantics missing from BAN logic, which is currently an axiomatic, semantic-less system.
