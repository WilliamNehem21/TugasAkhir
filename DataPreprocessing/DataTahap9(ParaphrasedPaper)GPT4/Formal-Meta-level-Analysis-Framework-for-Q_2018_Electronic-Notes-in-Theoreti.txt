This academic paper discusses the ongoing efforts in designing and developing Quantum Programming Languages (QPLs). It focuses on establishing a standard framework for verifying QPLs based on essential quantum computing concepts. The authors propose a specialized framework for meta-level analysis of functional QPLs using the Hybrid logical framework, which supports higher-order abstract syntax. By developing an intuitionistic linear specification logic on top of Hybrid, they aim to facilitate reasoning about the properties of QPLs.

The framework encompasses support for both typed and untyped quantum lambda calculi, where untyped calculi are favored for capturing a broader range of quantum features at the expense of certain type systems. The authors elaborate on the syntax and basic properties of object languages (OLs) in their framework, discussing how to prove various attributes such as type soundness and Turing completeness.

Utilizing the Coq proof assistant, the Hybrid library's primary file hybrid.v assists in defining the syntax for OLs, including a de Bruijn representation for lambda terms and facilities for encoding quantum variables, which are inherently linear and implicitly typed as qubits.

Differing from the standard lambda calculus and specific implementations like Proto-Quipper, the paper discusses a set of abstractions and constants designed to accommodate quantum computing's nuances. The authors focus on the meta-analysis of linear logic as a means to study object languages such as QPLs, aiming to prove meta-level theorems beneficial for any QPL analysis.

The formalization also includes constructs like universal quantifiers, various logical conjunctions, and both intuitionistic and linear implications, all essential components of the specification logic. It outlines a backchaining rule pivotal in encoding the inference rules of an OL and establishes the exchange property of the linear context, emphasizing the non-ordered nature of their version of linear logic.

The paper provides examples of their formalization using Proto-Quipper and outlines certain well-formedness conditions. The authors conclude by highlighting the proposed framework's capability to standardize the analysis of operational semantics and type safety for functional QPLs by leveraging the Hybrid system with linear specification logic, and they illustrate its viability through examples.
