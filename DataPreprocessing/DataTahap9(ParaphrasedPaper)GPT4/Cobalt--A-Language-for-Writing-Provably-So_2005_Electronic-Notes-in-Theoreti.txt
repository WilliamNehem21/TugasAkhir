This section provides an overview of the Cobalt programming language and the techniques used to verify the soundness of optimization processes within the language, referencing a more detailed discussion in an earlier paper. Section 2 outlines current and future efforts to enhance Cobalt's expressiveness while preserving automatic soundness validation. Section 3 examines related research, and Section 4 offers concluding thoughts.

Cobalt enables users to conduct pure analyses that compute or verify specific properties without modifying the code. These analyses label a control flow graph (CFG) with results, such as indicating non-pointer relationships, which can then inform subsequent analyses or optimizations. Unlike forward optimizations, pure analyses lack rewrite rules and profitability heuristics, but they do include a definition for the label they introduce. The soundness of pure analyses is verified using a method similar to that for forward transformation patterns.

The development team is creating a second iteration of Cobalt (Cobalt v2) that builds on the experiences from Cobalt v1 to greatly extend its functional range. Pure analyses in Cobalt v2 aim to highlight the language's advancements, demonstrating local conditions that can be combined to express various global conditions necessary for soundness reasoning. Compared to v1's single global condition style, v2's local if-then rules can be viewed as flow functions familiar to analysis writers, making it more accessible and compatible with existing dataflow analysis work.

Cobalt's approach to verifying the soundness of optimizations within its domain-specific language bears similarities to the earlier work on Gospel by Whitfield and Soffa, which analyzes optimization interactions. However, their focus differs with Gospel looking at optimization sequences, and Cobalt concentrating on soundness, while both include guarded rewrite rules. Cobalt also allows users to define dataflow dependencies, in contrast to Gospel's built-in dataflow primitives.

In summary, the Cobalt project is aimed at automatically ensuring compiler optimizations are correct, with a language crafted to suit this purpose. Cobalt balances expressivity with automatic correctness verifications, and contributes to compiler reliability as well as the vision for compilers that can be safely extended by users with unique or domain-specific optimizations.
