This paper advances Quality of Service (QoS) management by introducing a high-level, formal tool-based approach to analyze QoS contracts. The structure of the paper is as follows: Section 2 illustrates the proposed QoS contract language through a video-on-demand (VoD) application case study. Section 3 details the language's abstract operational semantics. In Section 4, the implementation of these semantics using the Maude MSOS tool is discussed. Section 5 explores the analysis of the VoD example, employing real-world data. The paper concludes with final thoughts in Section 6.

Originally, QoS contracts were akin to record types in programming, each index corresponding to a QoS property linked to various values, and were static in nature. Subsequent work by one of the authors expanded these contracts to include service negotiation and integrated this broader concept of QoS contract into a software architecture description language named CBabel.

In terms of normalization, when two rules with the same service on the left-hand side are encountered, they should be combined. If the outcomes (right-hand sides) do not overlap, a new rule is created with service S on the left and the combination of the outcomes on the right, arranged such that the second rule's outcome follows the first's. If there is an overlap, the sequence of the first rule takes precedence. While the current example does not require this process, the paper asserts it can be readily applied in general.
