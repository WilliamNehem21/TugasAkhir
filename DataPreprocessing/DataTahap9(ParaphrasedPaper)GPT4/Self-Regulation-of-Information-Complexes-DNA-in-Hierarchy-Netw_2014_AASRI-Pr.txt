In studies where fluorescence is used to observe the oxidative activity of DNA, the full chromosomal structure within cells, including both non-coding and coding regions of DNA, is examined. Due to the chaotic movement of cells within the bloodstream, observed under laser light, the resulting fluorescence data represent a range of two-dimensional projections across large cell populations.

One cannot easily isolate and study the contributions of just the non-coding or coding regions of DNA within cells, given that cells contain a full set of 46 chromosomes whose behavior is interdependent and synergistic. Statistical analysis of three-dimensional DNA fluorescence within neutrophils suggests that the actual interactions and complex configurations of DNA networks in living cells exhibit non-Gaussian statistics. These networks feature densely packed DNA that possesses a combination of both normal and abnormal fractal structures. The DNA's adaptability is facilitated by its changeability and the cell's ability to self-regulate information and entropy.

The complexity observed in the three-dimensional DNA structures within living cells greatly surpasses what is depicted as static coding sequences, gene networks, or the simplistic biochemical models often found in textbooks or in isolated genomic research. Despite many unresolved questions in various fields, certain universal patterns and switches in DNA networks allow us to classify different types of correlations and informational networks within cells, which can vary from one donor to another and over time.

Emerging physical and mathematical concepts for understanding the informational activity of three-dimensional DNA structures offer new insights into cell self-regulation, as well as potential advancements in medical diagnostics relating to health and immunity. Such self-regulatory processes are crucial for the body's response to a variety of local disruptions, including diseases, infections, traumas, etc. The response includes the remodeling of DNA's fractal and complex informational networks, which is essential for maintaining cellular health and immunity.
