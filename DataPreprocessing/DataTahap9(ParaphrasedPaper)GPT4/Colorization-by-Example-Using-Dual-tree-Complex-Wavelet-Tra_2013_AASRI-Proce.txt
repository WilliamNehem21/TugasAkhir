This academic paper presents an innovative and automated approach for colorizing grayscale images using an example color image. The process begins with partially segmenting both the grayscale and color images through unsupervised segmentation using JSEG. The segmentation process is fine-tuned by examining the grayscale image's histogram, which influences how segments are merged in JSEG.

JSEG segments the image into multiple regions, starting with quantizing the image to 16 levels with Peer Group Filtering (PGF), creating a class map. Then, using a calculated mean and window sizes ranging from 9x9 to 65x65, regions are grown to form the initial segments. The authors address the presence of over-segmentation by merging regions with similar intensities that are within a certain Euclidean distance from one another.

The methodology diverges for the grayscale image by using an adaptive merging process based on histogram analysisâ€”taking into account the areas of major interest as represented by histogram peaks. Segments representing less than 5% of the image are disregarded. A smaller merging threshold is applied if many significant areas are detected.

Feature vectors consisting of 14 sub-bands, derived from the magnitude of wavelet coefficients, are calculated for each square patch in both grayscale and example color images. To avoid mismatches, only patches larger than a certain size are considered for matching. This matching relies on calculating distances between the feature vectors, with the closest match allowing for color transfer based on the mean and standard deviation technique proposed by Welsh.

Any remaining small segments in the grayscale image that haven't been colorized are filled in using optimization techniques. This involves treating previously colored pixels as known values and utilizing the YUV color space to enforce consistency among neighboring pixels. Weighted averages of known color values are used to estimate the unknown values, leading to the grayscale image being fully colorized.

Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and automation benefits of the proposed colorization method, which has applications ranging from restoring old photos to enhancing the visual quality of images in various fields such as medical imaging, electron microscopy, and satellite imagery.
