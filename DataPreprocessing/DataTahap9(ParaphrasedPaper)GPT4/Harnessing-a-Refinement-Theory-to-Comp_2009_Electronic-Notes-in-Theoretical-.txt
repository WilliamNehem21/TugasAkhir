Closed Form Function: Essential to deducing a closed form equation for a loop is uncovering the underlying inductive principle that led to the loop's creation. Simply translating the loop into a recursive formula is effectively replacing one inductive process with another. Our goal is to determine the loop's closed form function by illustrating the influence of the loop's execution on all relevant program variables.

Stepwise Derivation: We aim to deduce the function of a loop incrementally by examining its smallest segments, which in turn reveals minute functional aspects of the loop. This approach facilitates the handling of large loops with minimal increase in complexity.

Analyzing Loops in CCA Form: Once the loop's structure is defined in Concurrency-Competitive Association (CCA) format, we can determine lower bounds by investigating individual statements or groups of up to three statements. To manage complexity, we limit our inspection to combinations of no more than three statements at any given time. The process involves scanning the CCA-formatted loop body, matching statements or statement sequences to pre-identified code patterns, and deriving specific lower bounds when matches occur. We use the term "recognizer" to describe the combination of variable declarations, code patterns, and their respective lower bounds. The recognizers are categorized based on the number of statements they matchâ€”single recognizers match one statement, two-recognizers match pairs of statements, and three-recognizers match triplets of statements. The current progress of the loop function extraction algorithm is summarized as follows:

Our divide-and-conquer strategy relies heavily on expressing the loop body as a series of concurrent assignments. Integrating conditional statements (if-then, if-then-else) disrupts this orderly framework by introducing unions between assignments. To identify a superset of a union, one must consider both sides of the union, conflicting with our divide-and-conquer methodology that promotes localized analysis. The stated theorem permits us to estimate a lower bound for the loop function in the context of if-then-else statements without the need to simultaneously examine the branches of the conditionals, but rather one at a time.
