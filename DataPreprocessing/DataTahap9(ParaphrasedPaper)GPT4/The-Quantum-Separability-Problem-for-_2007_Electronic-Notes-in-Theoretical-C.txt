In recent times, entanglement has emerged as a crucial and often essential factor in various quantum fields, including algorithms, communication, and cryptography. Given its significance, determining whether a quantum state is separable (non-entangled) or entangled is a question of great importance, a challenge known as the quantum separability problem (QSP). This issue falls within a class of combinatorial optimization challenges known as the weak membership problem.

The paper goes on to clarify that the mean, denoted as m, and the correlation matrix, denoted as v, serve as the defining elements of a Gaussian quantum state. For the purposes of the discussion, the focus is placed on scenarios where m=0 since any non-zero mean can be adjusted with a local operation without affecting the state's entanglement properties.

However, the situation becomes more complex when dealing with multipartite systems, where various degrees of entanglement can exist. Specifically, some subsystems may be separable relative to each other while still containing entangled components. This introduces nuanced layers to the QSP, particularly with Gaussian states, where the full understanding of separability has not yet been achieved.
