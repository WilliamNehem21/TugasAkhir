The primary aim of this research is to utilize the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) method to analyze and describe the distributional behaviors related to survival data, with a particular focus on comparing it with Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) as predictive tools. The study applies these methods to actual breast cancer patient data in order to estimate survival probabilities, risk factors, and various functions pertinent to the log-logistic distribution associated with survival studies.

In the ANN developed for survival analysis, key parameters are input, while the output layer provides survival analysis functions such as the reliability function, hazard rate function, probability density function, reverse hazard rate function, Mills ratio, odds function, and cumulative hazard rate (CHR) values. The study finds that the risk function increases with the duration of infection, then decreases, which matches the expected theoretical properties of the log-logistic distribution for the specific group of breast cancer patients analyzed. Furthermore, comparisons between practical outcomes and theoretical expectations confirm the validity of the log-logistic distribution in modeling survival data. ANNs are identified as powerful tools for predicting various key parameters, notably in the context of cancer patient survival due to their high predictive capabilities.

In support of the main findings, further research is discussed: Ambrogi et al. highlight the need for more accurate hazard functions in survival data analysis, suggesting the use of a multilayer perceptron as an enhancement to Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) with multinomial errors, alongside weight reduction for model complexity regulation. A genetic algorithm is also mentioned for independently controlling model parameters. The research's use and strength are demonstrated with an analysis of a sample of 1793 women with primary breast cancer.

Shafiq et al. employed separate ANN modeling and MLE techniques to estimate COVID-19 mortality rates in Italy, validating the reliability of both models through comparison. Bhambhvani et al. compared the predictability of ANN and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models in survival and overall longevity for bladder cancer patients, highlighting machine learning as a potentially more effective method for analyzing complex administrative datasets, and particularly for forecasting breast cancer prognosis.

As survival analysis grows rich in various fields, including medicine, biology, social sciences, econometrics, and engineering, this study seeks to contribute by examining the effectiveness of survival function estimators and modeling survival data for breast cancer patients using the log-logistic (LL) distribution. The research aims to address the lack of studies exploring metric analysis of the probability survival model through both MLE and ANN, while simultaneously striving to optimize and predict the reliability of lifetime models using these methodologies. The work underscores the importance of timing in survival analysis, where survival times are a critical metric for understanding and predicting long-term events such as the duration from a starting point (e.g., birth, treatment onset) to a terminal event (e.g., death, treatment failure). Here, the survival function is a key measure used to model time-related changes in the probability of occurrence of the terminal event.
