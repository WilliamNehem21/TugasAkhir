This paper introduces a Weakest Precondition (WP) logic for reasoning about rewriting strategies within the Stratego language, a domain-specific language tailored for programming such strategies. Complex rewriting strategies, which dictate how terms are transformed through rewrite rules, are challenging to understand and reason about when expressed in operational terms. To address this, the paper utilizes the modal mu-calculus within its logic to express properties at arbitrary depths of term structures.

Stratego is a language for programming strategies, which operates over a domain of terms and controls strategy execution via recursion and non-deterministic choice. In contrast to if-then-else constructs, conditional control in Stratego relies on the success or finite failure of strategies. The language also supports higher-order strategies through term congruences.

The presented WP logic enables logical reasoning about strategies by interpreting predicates over a structured term domain. This logic aims to characterize the most extensive set of input terms from which a given strategy can reliably produce an output term that meets a particular postcondition.

To demonstrate the usefulness of the WP logic, the paper provides examples of reduction strategies within the lambda calculus that incorporate explicit substitutions. Additionally, the paper compares this approach with related work and concludes by summarizing its contributions.

Key terms like the Herbrand universe and environments are mentioned, providing context for understanding how bindings and terms interact within strategies. The WP logic helps formalize this interaction, offering tools to define complex strategies using basic binding and building strategies and expressing properties of term substructures through CTL-inspired modalities.

By establishing a WP logic for Stratego, the paper takes a crucial step toward a formal reasoning framework that not only makes strategy creation more manageable but also enhances comprehension of the logic underlying these programmed strategies.
