The article discusses the current state of mathematical modeling of photosynthesis, noting that existing coarse-grained models address parts of the overall process by simulating the dynamics of light reactions and energy transfer through complex protein interactions. However, these models face challenges in representing the numerous local modifications that proteins undergo following photon absorption.

To address these issues, the authors established an online repository for photosynthesis models, which has raised questions regarding the differing levels of model detail and the challenge of describing them within a single, expressive formal language. They advocate for the practical application of advanced formal methods in photosynthesis modeling, sharing years of collaboration with researchers in the field.

The authors utilize the BioNetGen Language (BNGL) and associated tools to implement models and have automated their reduction procedure using Python. They demonstrate the strength of process-algebraic frameworks in representing complex, exponentially large systems of light reactions.

Rule-based modeling has various applications, but its use in photosynthesis is scarce. The article cites pioneering work that models chlorophyll a fluorescence induction kinetics within a rule-based system, offering a stochastic simulation algorithm that factors in various protein complex modifications affecting electron transfer rates.

BNGL, a tool used by the authors, defines agents as molecules with internal and binding states. The article explains molecule types, reaction rules, and syntax in BNGL, noting how rules are depicted by left-hand side (LHS) and right-hand side (RHS) notation, with different possible rule types (binding, unbinding, modification).

The researchers developed an algorithm for exploring the space of possible model reductions, employing heuristics like context elimination and rule elimination to achieve maximal reductions. Their approach emphasizes the adaptability of photosynthesis to fluctuating light environments and the need to understand underlying mechanisms better.

Despite the complexity of photosynthesis models, the authors argue that traditional reaction-based modeling fails to capture the process's full complexity due to combinatorial explosion challenges. Rule-based modeling, however, allows for a more detailed and less simplified representation. They demonstrate that naive reformulation of photosynthesis models into rule-based models can be overly large and fail to use the format's benefits. By defining and applying syntactic operations, they significantly reduce the size of these models automatically and demonstrate the improvements in clarity and extendibility, particularly for the PSII portion of the photosynthesis model.

In conclusion, they show that rule-based modeling is a suitable alternative for capturing the mechanistic complexity of biochemical processes like photosynthesis without the simplifying assumptions required by traditional models.
