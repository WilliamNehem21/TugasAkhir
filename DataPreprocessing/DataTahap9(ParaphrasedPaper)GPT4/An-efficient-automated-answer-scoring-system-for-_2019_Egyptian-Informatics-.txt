The paper discusses the potential of automated essay scoring (AES) systems. Traditional grading methods lack consistency, whereas automated systems offer fair and repeatable scoring across multiple tests. The development of such a system in an Indian language could pave the way for similar systems in other Indian languages.

In exploring Natural Language Processing (NLP)-based automated answer scoring methods, the paper asserts that semantic similarity is crucial in fields like information retrieval, text mining, and text-related research. Despite the promising nature of these systems, perfecting English AES remains a challenging task.

AES systems integrate techniques from NLP, linguistics, artificial intelligence, machine learning, statistics, and web technologies. Most current systems focus on machine learning and grammatical quality without adequately assessing the semantic content of essays.

Various researchers and their contributions are highlighted:

1. Chen et al. (2010) described an unsupervised voting algorithm for AES without using reference texts.
2. Chen, He, and Baobin (2012) presented a ranked-based learning approach that treats scoring as a ranking problem with a focus on feature extraction.
3. Luis Tandalla (2012) scored short-answer essays by comparing student responses to expertly written model answers.
4. Kolomiyets et al. (2011) discussed question-answering technology, focusing on different levels of processing from simple bag-of-words to complex semantic roles.
5. Kong Joo Lee et al. (2011) introduced an automated system to evaluate English sentences, highlighting common NLP challenges.
6. Paloma Moreda et al. (2011) proposed using semantic rules and WordNet in question-answering systems to improve answer extraction.
7. Matthias H. Heie et al. (2012) adopted statistical language modelling for question answering, aiming to create robust multi-language systems.
8. Min-chul Yang et al. (2015) used semantic embedding space for knowledge-based question answering across various domains.
9. Sofian Hazrina et al. (2016) addressed the disambiguation in semantic question answering systems.
10. Boris Galitsky et al. (2017) explored discourse-level analysis for complex question-answering through matching parse thickets.
11. Zhang Qiang et al. (2014) looked into the use of network AES in college English writing courses.
12. Yonghong Yan et al. (2012) described an AES system using vector regression and content vector analysis.
13. Jovita and Linda et al. (2015) implemented the vector space model in question-answering systems and suggested potential improvements.

The paper also mentions an experiment involving LSTM neural networks, where reducing the number of units and layers in the network improved performance.

In summary, the paper reviews various methodologies for AES and question-answering systems, outlining the significance of NLP and other AI technologies in developing reliable and consistent scoring methods. It underscores the interdisciplinary nature of this research and the opportunities it presents for further innovation.
