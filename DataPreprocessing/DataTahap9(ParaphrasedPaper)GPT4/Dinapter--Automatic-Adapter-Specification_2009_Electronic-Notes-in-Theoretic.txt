This study introduces Dinapter 4, a tool for creating specifications for behavioral adapters that address signature and behavioral incompatibilities. Dinapter 4 processes behavioral interfaces in abstract BPEL, generating adapter specifications that detail solutions for such mismatches. These specifications facilitate the creation of the final adapter by other systems referenced in the text.

The paper is structured as follows: an example of Dinapter's functionality is provided in Section 2; Section 3 discusses the tool's parameters and results; related work is reviewed in Section 4; and future directions and conclusions are offered in Section 5.

Internally, Dinapter utilizes A* algorithm and expert system techniques to produce adapter specifications based on an adaptation policy. Its integration with ITACA has improved its capabilities, including semantic analysis using WordNet::Similarity, which aids in resolving naming mismatches and improving event-driven condition adaptations.

The paper compares Dinapter 4 to other approaches. For instance, Moser et al.'s platform, VIEDAME, requires manually designed transformers for service adaptation, while Dinapter can automate this process. Schmidt and Reussner, as well as Autili et al., developed systems for automatic adapter generation, but these systems lack full resolution of signature mismatches and certain behavioral incompatibilities.

Other related works address web services adaptation using various approaches. Brogi and Popescu's methodology handles behavioral mismatches but not signature mismatches. Motahari Nezhad et al.'s COMA++ assists with schema matching but doesn't automate the resolution process.

Overall, Dinapter 4 automates the generation of specifications to build adapters that handle complex incompatibilities, a significant advancement from manual specification creation. Current work on Dinapter includes incorporating linear temporal logic to enhance specification accuracy and overcome deception by components that could lead to invalid deadlocks-free specifications.
