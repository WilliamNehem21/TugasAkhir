The paper presents an algebraic approach to automatic theorem proving called polynomial ring calculus, which handles polynomials over finite fields. This approach is versatile and can be applied across various logical domains, including first-order logic and modal logic. It is particularly effective for many-valied logics, whether deterministic or non-deterministic.

The paper aims to extend this method to any finite-valued non-deterministic semantics and examines its computational aspects by developing software that can convert provability in logical systems to operations on polynomial rings.

The concept of non-deterministic truth values was introduced, allowing for a range of options rather than a single deterministic outcome. This has led to a generalization of truth-functionality and has been applied to many-valied logic matrices.

The paper highlights the connection between the notion of analyticity in philosophy and logic, citing W.V. Quine's work on the subject. It was shown that using non-deterministic matrices can generalize classical deterministic matrices, where traditional deterministic matrices are seen as a special case of non-deterministic matrices (Nmatrices).

Interestingly, polynomial expressions over finite fields can capture the nuances of non-truth-functional logics, with examples provided to show how this differs from traditional binary approaches.

The authors concluded that the polynomials they presented offered a correct and complete polynomial representation for certain sentence structures. Also, non-deterministic semantics help preserve the benefits of finite-valued logics while being applicable to a broader array of logics.

Nmatrices, while a specific instance of the broader possible-translations semantics, provide a convenient means to compute semantics, and their polynomial representation is useful for that purpose. The relational semantics conceived by J.M. Dunn are also connected to this polynomial approach.

Lastly, the paper introduces the PolCA software, an open-source tool that translates sentences from various logics into polynomials over finite fields, thereby facilitating an intuitive method to execute proofs.
