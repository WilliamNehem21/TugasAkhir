In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the suggested optimizations, we formulated various types of conditional formulas that serve as test cases. Each type is defined by a unique structural complexity which corresponds to different aspects of our algorithms, highlighting their respective strengths and weaknesses:

These evaluations were carried out on a Linux PC equipped with a dual-core AMD Opteron 2220 SE processor running at 2.8 GHz and 16 GB of RAM. The results clearly indicate that our optimizations can lead to a marked improvement in performance. In terms of overall effectiveness, the implementation of our new algorithms within the generic reasoning tool 'Coloss' shows performance levels on par with specialized conditional logic solvers such as CondLean. However, making a direct comparison between the two is challenging at the moment because CondLean's benchmark formulas are not fully disclosed in the literature.
