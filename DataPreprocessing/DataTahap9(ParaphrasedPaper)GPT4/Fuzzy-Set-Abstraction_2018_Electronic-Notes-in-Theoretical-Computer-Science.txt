Analyzing software is critical for its enhancement. Traditional static analyses deliver universally reliable results yet tend to be overly conservative, while dynamic analyses provide precise outcomes albeit with restricted scope. We introduce a novel concept called the fuzzy set abstraction. It expands on prior methodologies rooted in three-valued logic by allowing for a blend of static and dynamic analyses, which results in statically derived conclusions that can be dynamically fine-tuned using fuzzy control systems.

Integrating both analysis types can notably enhance outcomes, like in verifying non-functional aspects of software. For example, during compilation, conservative assumptions about variable states or environments are valuable to prevent the application of harmful optimizations. Conversely, at runtime, knowing the precise inputs enables the exact valuation of optimizations. Our fuzzy dataflow framework demonstrates that analyses through fuzzy logic can detect optimization opportunities overlooked by traditional methods. This framework permits many-valued fuzzy logics to express program properties with varying degrees of truth, reflected along a continuum between 0 (false) and 1 (true).

We further detail the fuzzy set abstraction, offering both theoretical underpinnings and proof of its soundness for static analysis. Additionally, we describe a dynamic analysis method where we employ an adaptive fuzzy inference system from control theory to increasingly refine analysis results for better precision.

The paper also introduces foundational concepts from fuzzy set theory, such as manipulations of fuzzy sets via predicate transformers and the use of collector functions derived from possibility theory. These tools help the static analyses which are then refined through iterative dynamic analysis to enhance result accuracy. We base our work on an existing program analysis framework, adapting it to our fuzzy set abstraction.

This research also discusses embeddings, a concept from Sagiv et al., that bridges the gap between binary and ternary valuation systems, clustering elements or properties to reduce information loss. This method helps define the abstract semantics of a program's flow-graph and is key for clustering in our approach.

In conclusion, the fuzzy set abstraction framework allows for properties of programs to be considered true or false to varying extents. This paves the way for speculative optimizations based on the likelihood of certain conditions. Additionally, we've demonstrated the potential of hybrid analysis by using TS-ANFIS, an adaptive system from fuzzy control theory, which could lead to the adoption of further insights from the vast literature of fuzzy control.
