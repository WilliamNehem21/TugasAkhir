In this paper, the authors address the challenge of creating C2 rational cubic splines to preserve the shape characteristics of given data. Specifically, the spline is designed to maintain positivity and convexity when interpolating positive and convex data sets, respectively. The proposed C2 rational cubic spline function incorporates two sets of free parameters that allow for the generation of positive C2 curves from positive data and convex C2 curves from convex data. The authors establish straightforward constraints related to the free parameters within the cubic function to ensure the spline accurately represents the intended shape of the data. These rational cubic spline methods provide a precise and unique way to represent the given data.

The paper also reviews previous work where Hussain and others utilized a rational cubic function for scientific data visualization, imposing conditions on free parameters to shape the data with C1 continuity. Sarfraz and colleagues developed a C1 interpolant to represent the shape of 2D positive data with a rational cubic function, setting similar constraints on the free parameters and later extended their approach to 3D positive data representation.
