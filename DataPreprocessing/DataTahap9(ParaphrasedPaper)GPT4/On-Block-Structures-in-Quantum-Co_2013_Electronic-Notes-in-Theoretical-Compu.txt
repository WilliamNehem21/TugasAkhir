In the last part of our study, we apply the logical block structures we've discussed to provide a visual interpretation of two well-known quantum processes, specifically superdense coding and quantum teleportation. Our main ambition is to craft a dedicated logic tailored to such quantum protocols and to encapsulate this reasoning within a computational algebra system for the purposes of simulation and authentication. This endeavor is a continuation of previous research concerning the meaning behind quantum programming languages (refer to studies [1,19,20,21]).

In Example 3.5, when we consider the realm of Hilbert spaces, we come across several familiar components that were mentioned before. However, within this standard framework of quantum effects, we don't see the logical block structures that we discussed earlier. This scenario is elaborated on, using Example 2.5 as a foundation.
