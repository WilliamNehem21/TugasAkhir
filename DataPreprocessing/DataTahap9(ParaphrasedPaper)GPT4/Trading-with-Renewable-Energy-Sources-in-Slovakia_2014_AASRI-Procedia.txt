The renewable energy sources (RES) market is influenced by both demand and supply factors. Supply is determined by the innate resources available and their associated costs, and it is influenced by both the investment in and production phase of RES-related projects. On the flip side, the demand for RES is boosted by policies and incentives aimed at encouraging consumption.

Support systems for the generation of electricity from RES are closely tied to the mechanisms for trading RES within the energy sector. A common and popular support mechanism across many European Union countries is a fixed system of purchase prices, which is often paired with additional market price premiums. Other effective means of fostering RES include investment grants and various tax incentives.

Obligatory quotas and the trade of green certificates act as the primary support structures in countries such as Belgium, Romania, Poland, Italy, and Great Britain. By contrast, tendering systems are less prevalent, though they are currently implemented in Ireland, Latvia, Italy, and Great Britain as a method of promoting RES.

While the predominant system of fixed purchase prices is convenient, it has drawn criticism for potential market distortion and its overall efficacy. The quota system and green certificates approach are advocated as alternatives that could introduce more market dynamics and subsequently drive more robust growth in RES electricity production. However, newer EU member states have expressed resistance to this shift; they rely on fixed purchase prices, and the rapid establishment of a market system based on green certificates is deemed an overly challenging and potentially unfeasible short-term objective. Consequently, these states prefer to focus on improving the quality of their existing support systems instead.
