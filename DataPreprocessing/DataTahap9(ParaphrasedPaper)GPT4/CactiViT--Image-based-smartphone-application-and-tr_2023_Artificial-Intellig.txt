Considerable progress in plant disease recognition has been made through deep learning techniques, starting from the development of the AlexNet architecture, which surpassed traditional support vector machines (SVMs). Researchers have formulated and tested multiple models with the publicly accessible PlantVillage dataset. To enhance the robustness of these systems, the vision transformer (ViT) model is routinely retrained using this dataset, and the latest versions are delivered to users' smartphones through an app for improved diagnosis precision. Additionally, this research incorporated a new dataset that features images of cacti affected by cochineal pests. With this system, cactus cultivators can conveniently monitor plant health.

The paper is structured as follows: a brief introduction to the research background; an explanation of the datasets, materials, and methodology involved; a detailed account of the experimental procedures; a presentation and discussion of the findings; and finally, a conclusion of the study.

The paper also notes the contrast between the performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and natural language processing (NLP) technologies in interpreting semantic information within data, with the latter often yielding improved outcomes. CNNs tend to focus on the immediate vicinity of pixel clusters, potentially overlooking pertinent information. This limitation becomes evident when identifying multifaceted features, such as early cochineal infestations on cacti, where high precision is critical. The insufficient accuracy particularly affects categories of cacti that are damaged, in the initial infection stage, or healthy, since these share visual similarities, making it challenging to distinguish among them. This challenge is exacerbated because the early symptoms of cochineal, represented by a bright, waxy substance on the leaves, can easily be confused with other elements like thorns reflecting sunlight, dust, or even other kinds of infestations.

The proposed mobile application simplifies disease identification for farmers: they take a photo using the app, which processes the image offline with a cached, serialized version of the original model, enabling them to receive instant results without the need for an internet connection.
