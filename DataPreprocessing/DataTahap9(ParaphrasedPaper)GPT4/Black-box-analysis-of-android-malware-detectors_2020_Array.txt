This study examines the effectiveness of Android malware detectors in the face of obfuscated malware features. By deliberately obscuring certain elements in known malware samples, the researchers assess the reliability of these detectors and identify which features are most critical for their detection processes, essentially reverse-engineering the mechanisms of proprietary malware detection algorithms. Using a range of different obfuscation techniques and analyzing their impact on detection, the researchers uncover varying degrees of detector robustness and the significance of certain features for detection. Despite the potential benefits of this knowledge to malevolent actors, it provides valuable insights into improving malware detector design.

The paper is structured as follows: After a review of related literature, the paper discusses the background context, then presents experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of different obfuscation techniques against a variety of Android malware detectors. It concludes with a summary and suggestions for future research.

The researchers use a tool they developed, named Modified AAMO (MAAMO), to apply various obfuscation methods, such as renaming code elements, reordering code, and using goto statements. They test these obfuscated malware samples against 64 detectors on VirusTotal, an online service that aggregates multiple antivirus products.

The results show that obfuscation techniques can significantly impact detection effectiveness, with different detectors showing varying levels of sensitivity to different obfuscations. However, a few detectors, like ESET-NOD32, were notably proficient in identifying even the obfuscated malware. The study also notes the wide disparity in detection capabilities among VirusTotal's malware detectors.

The findings suggest that malware detectors based on machine learning might offer advancements and warrant further investigation into their robustness against malware obfuscations. The Modified AAMO tool and this study's results could serve as a foundation for such future research.
