Employing the same methodology, we demonstrate that both the category of differences between computably enumerable reals (d.c.e reals) and the category of computable approximable reals (c.a. reals) constitute real closed fields. The finding concerning d.c.e. reals was nearly concurrently and separately ascertained by Ng.

The significance of this finding hinges on the actuality of weakly computably Lipschitz (w.c.l.l.) functions. These functions indisputably exist. To corroborate this, we call upon an essential principle from real analysis: if a function f is differentiable across an open set E, then within E, f upholds a local Lipschitz condition.
