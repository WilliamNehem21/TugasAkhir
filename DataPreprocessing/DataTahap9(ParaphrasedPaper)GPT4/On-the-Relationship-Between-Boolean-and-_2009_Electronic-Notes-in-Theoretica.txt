The paper discusses a characteristic feature of the Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) fuzzification method, which pertains to the way it can be associated with the likelihood of a '1' appearing at a specific time in a cell within a Boolean cellular automaton (CA). DNF fuzzification outputs fuzzy values within the interval [0, 1], which allows for these values to be interpreted as the probability that a particular cell in the automaton will have the value '1' at the next time step.

For clarity, the paper introduces some symbols: let \( E(Z) \) represent the expected value of a random variable \( Z \). When \( Z \) is a binary random variable, \( E(Z) \) corresponds to the probability \( P(Z=1) \). The paper illustrates that by applying the fuzzification function \( F \) to both the expected values of a cell \( y_i \) and its \( 2q \) neighboring cells, the resultant is the expected value of the cell's next state, \( g[y_i] \).

Further exploration in the paper extends to the concept of additivity in Boolean CAs, a topic that is well-documented in the literature. The paper links Boolean and fuzzy CAs by introducing a novel fuzzy attribute termed 'self-oscillation' and goes on to characterize the set of self-oscillating fuzzy CAs. Although the research is primarily focused on one-dimensional CAs, the authors clarify that the findings are applicable to CAs of any dimension.

Lastly, the paper examines the behavior of functions that settle towards either the value zero or one. It concludes that such functions cannot be self-oscillating because their values will continually be either above or below the convergence value. The paper establishes the proof of this assertion through mathematical induction, based on the number of variables in the function \( f \), which correlates to the size of the neighborhood in question.
