This paper introduces a method for addressing the parameterised probabilistic model checking challenge for certain types of randomised distributed systems represented as Markov decision processes. Specifically, the paper focuses on systems known as degenerative, which are characterised by their ability to transition from their original communication graph to a simpler, reduced graph over time, while preserving certain behaviours.

The authors propose an induction framework that allows analysis of these degenerative systems across various communication graph structures. They argue that by proving a set of quantitative Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) properties for systems with a basic underlying graph structure, these properties will also hold true for the same systems with any more complex communication graph.

The technique is exemplified through a case study of the IEEE 1394 (FireWire) Tree Identify Protocol (TIP), a leader election protocol organized in an acyclic topology. The protocol's degenerative nature means that parts of the system cease to participate over time as messages are exchanged.

The study demonstrates that if a set of quantitative LTL properties, excluding the next-time operator, is valid for the system with a star topology, it will remain valid for any acyclic topology after gradually reducing the graph by removing specific vertices.

However, this technique is confined to degenerative protocols, which, although common in distributed systems, can present additional complications when the degeneration occurs probabilistically rather than deterministically. The authors acknowledge this as an area for future research where the induction framework will need adaptation to address such challenges.
