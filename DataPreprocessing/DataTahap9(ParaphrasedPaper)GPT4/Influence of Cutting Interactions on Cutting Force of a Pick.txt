In the field of mechanized continuous mining, the proper choice of machinery and operational settings is critical and hinges on accurately predicting the reactive torque of the mining drum and the related forces that impact each cutting pick. Knowing the forces exerted on these picks is also crucial for refining pick design. Hence, precise estimation of the forces on a pick during extraction is vital.

A cutting pick experiences three perpendicular forces: the cutting force (also known as drag force), a normal force, and a sideway force (also called lateral force). This study primarily deals with the cutting force, as it significantly influences chip formation and removal from the rock, and is therefore the focus of much existing research. Understanding the cutting force is also essential for determining the specific energy required for mining.

Substantial research has been directed towards developing models to predict cutting force, using theoretical, empirical, semi-empirical, and numerical methods. Although these models are diverse in their considerations and foundations and developed for various pick types like radial and point-attack picks, the depth of cut (DOC) invariably emerges as a key variable. For example, Evans and Goktan noted a quadratic relationship between cutting force and DOC. Meanwhile, Yilmaz et al. found a linear relationship, and Liu et al. observed an exponential correlation in their respective lab experiments.
