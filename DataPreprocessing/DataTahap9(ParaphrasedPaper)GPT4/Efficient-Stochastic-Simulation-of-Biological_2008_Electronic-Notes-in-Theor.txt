Unfortunately, the Multi-Scale Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (MSSA) retains the computational complexity of the original SSA and also introduces an extra parameter—the number of compartments—that makes simulations impractical when the number of compartments increases, as discussed in the literature. Although several enhancements to the SSA have been suggested in previous research, none are effectively adaptable to the MSSA because of its particular aspect of managing multiple compartments with stochastic volume variations.

However, it is possible to improve the computational efficiency of the MSSA to O(log m + log c) using optimized data structures that were initially designed to improve the SSA. The justification for using these data structures comes from two key insights. Firstly, only a limited number of propensity functions are affected with each state transition, which can be identified using a dependency graph. Secondly, a linear arrangement represented by {t1,...,tc} captures information about the propensities of reactions within each compartment. By organizing data using a double-tree structure, one can express the propensity functions independently from the compartment volumes, which means they do not need to be recalculated every time the volumes change.
