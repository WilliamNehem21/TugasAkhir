This academic paper addresses the challenge of noise in the input and output signals of a visual measurement system. Traditional computational approaches, like the classic least mean square algorithm or recursive least square, tend to produce large errors when dealing with noisy data, and direct calculations are often too complex to manage efficiently.

To improve precision, the paper proposes an adaptive total least squares algorithm, which treats the solution of the weight vector as an optimally constrained problem using the Rayleigh quotient of the augmented input vector self-correlation matrix. This approach involves iterative estimation of the augmented input vector and establishes a functional relationship between step factor and error.

Simulation analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed adaptive total least squares algorithm achieves a significantly higher precision level of 0.0375mm standard tolerance compared to the 0.0598mm standard tolerance of the normal total least squares algorithm. The paper emphasizes that the adaptive algorithm offers simplicity in structure, faster computation, and greater accuracy than traditional methods.

In summary, the research not only identifies the deficits in current total least squares methods when dealing with noise but also introduces and validates an enhanced algorithm that minimizes error and increases computational efficiency in visual measurement systems.
