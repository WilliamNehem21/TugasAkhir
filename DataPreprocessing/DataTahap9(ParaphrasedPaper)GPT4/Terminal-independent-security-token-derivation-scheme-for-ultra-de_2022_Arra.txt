Data transmission across various sectors, such as healthcare and military, frequently encounters security threats that compromise confidentiality and integrity. Medical data transmitted over public wireless networks, for example, is vulnerable to privacy breaches. Similarly, the Internet of Drones (IoD) used in surveillance and remote operations can suffer from security and privacy issues during communications. In the field of smart grids, the adoption of 5G technology has brought about significant improvements in speed and reliability, yet it also presents new privacy and security challenges due to the public nature of 5G networks. The continuous and pervasive connections of IoT devices to networks in the 5G-IoT ecosystem make these devices targets of attacks like Denial of Service (DoS) and impersonation.

The vast amounts of data collected by 5G-IoT networks, which often includes sensitive information, necessitates robust protection. IoT message exchanges are particularly vulnerable due to the lack of security and privacy measures. As such, the means to authenticate devices and pinpoint their location are key to preventing unauthorized access. The 5G Authentication and Key Agreement protocol (5G AKA) has been instituted to provide identity privacy and guard against fake base station attacks, which are prevalent in 4G networks. However, traceability attacks on IoT devices are still a significant concern in 5G.

This paper is organized with a review of related work in Section 2, the proposed system model in Section 3, a security analysis in Section 4, and a performance evaluation in Section 5. The conclusion in Section 6 outlines the paper's findings and suggests future research directions.

Despite existing measures, current IoT security protocols either miss certain essential security and privacy capabilities or are too complex in terms of communication and computation. To overcome these issues, this paper introduces a lightweight scheme employing Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) and biometrics that addresses mutual authentication, session key agreement, anonymity, untraceability, and key secrecy. Two phases are highlighted in the protocol; the first is for data access, involving mutual authentication and session key negotiation, while the second is for updating passwords or biometric data locally to adjust user permissions.

The paper provides lemmas with proof under the Canetti-Krawczyk threat model assumptions, demonstrating that the proposed scheme is secure against a wide range of attacks. Moreover, a comparative analysis with other protocols shows that the proposed scheme surpasses them in many aspects, offering the highest number of security features.
