Paraphrasing the academic paper:

**Background:** Biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs) are indispensable for systematizing biological data. With the rapid evolution of biomedical knowledge, these KGs need frequent updates to incorporate new findings. Although Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies have advanced automatic updating by extracting information from texts, achieving full automation is challenging due to the scarcity of annotated biomedical data. This study seeks to investigate effective methods for automatically extracting causal relationships from biomedical texts to promptly update KGs that illustrate disease mechanisms pathophysiology.

**Methods:** We retrieve PubMed abstracts using relevant search terms, then process these abstracts through an NLP pipeline for automatic information extraction. We focus on identifying cause-effect relationship 'triples' and record them in the Biological Expression Language (BEL). Knowledge domain experts evaluate the triples for completeness, relevance, accuracy, and inventiveness.

Numerous efforts in biomedical information extraction focus on converting scientific text into structured forms like ontologies and KGs. These efforts range from manual to automated/semi-automated processes. For example, Santos et al. introduced a clinical KG linking proteomics with other 'omics' data streams, while Thomas et al. developed the Gene Ontology Causal Activity Modeling (GO-CAM) framework for modeling complex biological functions.

For our study, we queried PubMed for abstracts on tau protein phosphorylation and modifications, using selected terms aligning with our KG's context. Searching multiple databases, we validated and enriched our KG's information, focusing on potential drug targets for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD).

We also used graph-based algorithms like the in-house software package BiKMi to pinpoint novel regulators of phosphorylated tau (ptau). Additionally, we assessed machine learning (ML) strategies like the Path Ranking Algorithm (PRA) to expedite hypothesis generation. The effectiveness of these approaches depends on the quality of the KG and the performance of the knowledge graph embedding (KGE) algorithms. Zeng et al. have analyzed various hypothesis generation methods in KGs for drug discovery, underscoring the challenges in automating such workflows.

We further enriched our findings by consulting numerous gene, protein, and disease databases. Through these databases, we can establish comprehensive associations between proteins and diseases. The paper notes the complexity of therapeutic interventions targeting the Apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene, given its isoform-specific impact on brain functions. Nevertheless, understanding APOE's role is critical for developing AD treatments.
