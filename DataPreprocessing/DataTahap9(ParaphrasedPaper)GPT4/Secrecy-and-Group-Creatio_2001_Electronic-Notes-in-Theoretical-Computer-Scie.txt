In the modified version of the typed pi-calculus introduced in this paper, a group creation operation is added, with a group acting as a channel type. Introducing new groups helps to prevent specific communications statically, thus averting the unintended or intentional disclosure of confidential information. The authors adapt a concept of secrecy originally proposed by Abadi and demonstrate that this property of secrecy is maintained. This principle of group creation, when utilized within the ambient calculus framework, is also effective for generating and maintaining shared secrets among mobile agents.
