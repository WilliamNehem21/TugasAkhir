Since the 1970s, the study of chaotic systems has been a significant focus within the field of dynamical systems, and a considerable amount of work has been devoted to defining chaos in precise mathematical terms. Multiple definitions of chaos have been proposed, and there is a rich body of research on how these various definitions relate to each other. For an in-depth review of this topic, readers can refer to the literature cited.

This academic paper delves into the concept of strong chaos, specifically within the framework of topological groups. It demonstrates that a locally compact Hausdorff topological group can have a faithful and strongly chaotic continuous action on a Hausdorff space if and only if the group is both strongly syndetically separated and non-compact. When considering discrete groups, this notion translates to a characterization of infinite residually finite groups using topological dynamics. The concept of chaos used in this characterization has been the subject of many discussions, especially from the perspective of group theory.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses some general concerns associated with continuous group actions. Section 3 introduces terms related to topological group compactifications and a particular type of separation property. In Section 4, concepts of periodicity and chaos are defined in relation to a certain class of group compactifications, expanding upon previously discussed concepts. Section 5 presents a geometric characterization of compactification classes for a given locally compact Hausdorff topological group that allows for a faithful or chaotic continuous action on a (compact) Hausdorff space (as outlined in Theorem 5.5). This leads to a new way of describing non-compact, maximally almost periodic, locally compact Hausdorff topological groups through topological dynamics (as stated in Corollary 5.6).

Furthermore, the paper establishes that for a topological group G with a subclass D from the compactifications of G, if G supports a faithful D-chaotic continuous action on a Hausdorff space, then G must be non-compact, and D must separate compact subsets of G. The final section proves that the opposite also holds true for locally compact Hausdorff topological groups.
