The academic paper posits that variables not highlighted (those without marks in labels) should be considered existential quantifiers, with each having at least one element in their extension. Labels comprise lists of both marked and unmarked variables wherein the sequence in which they appear is significant.

Simplicity is favored in the presentation by avoiding the use of constants and functions. The inclusion of more intricate terms would require labels to encompass details regarding the involved variables; such elaboration is omitted from the current discussion.
