The paper discusses Spartacus, a system developed to determine the satisfiability of H(E,@), which is an elementary hybrid logic that includes global modalities. In this context, different types of variables are identified: those representing states (x, y), properties (p, q), and relations (r). The expressions within H(E,@) are constructed based on a defined grammar.

A key feature of Sparatacus is the use of a pattern store, a specialized data structure that records which patterns have been expanded, as a result of prior rule applications involving the diamond symbol. When relation 'r' is applied to a formula containing state 'x', the corresponding property pattern 'pxs' is stored. To determine if 'r' can be applied to a state 'x', the system performs a subset matching operation, checking if the pattern store contains a superset of 'pxs'. This operation's efficiency is essential for the performance of Spartacus.

PBB, the key algorithm utilized by Spartacus, is influenced by existing modal caching techniques, particularly the one elaborated by Giunchiglia and Tacchella. Though PBB encompasses these techniques, it also offers additional functionalities, particularly when dealing with transitivity and global modalities, where standard satisfiability caching methods may fail without further refinement and the incorporation of blocking techniques.

Comparatively, Lazy Branching (LB) displays more versatility than lazy unfolding, having a greater range of applicability. However, when both methods can be applied, lazy unfolding might be more effective because it prevents the generation of delayed disjunctions rather than just limiting their processing.

To integrate LB into the heuristic driven rule application process predominantly used in related systems, LB is implemented as a separate layer over the rule application queue. Unlike typical heuristics that affect the ordering of pending rule applications, LB actively prohibits the addition of disjunctions to the queue if they are marked for delay, thus permitting LB to function independently from the standard rule application strategies.

The paper also notes a limitation in the evaluation process; the authors were unable to include comparisons with the prover DLP, known for its performance with logic K, due to compatibility issues with the required compiler. For reference to DLP's performance, other sources are cited.

This summary reflects the key aspects of the system while omitting specific technical details and the intricacies of the grammar mentioned.
