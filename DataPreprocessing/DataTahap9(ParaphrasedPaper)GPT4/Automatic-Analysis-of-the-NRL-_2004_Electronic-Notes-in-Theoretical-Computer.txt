The academic paper describes the NRL Pump, a secure device used as a router to transfer messages from a lower-security-level system to a higher-security-level system. This device is designed to prevent the creation of covert channels through the manipulation of acknowledgment (ACK) timing. Normally, if the higher-level system were to send ACKs directly to the lower-level system, it could theoretically manipulate the timing to transmit hidden information.

To prevent this, the NRL Pump separates the flow of ACKs. The paper proposes a system where the timing for the acknowledgments sent by the NRL Pump to the lower-level system is probabilistically determined. This determination is based on the moving average of ACK times from the higher-level system to the Pump. This method ensures that the higher-level system cannot use ACK timings to communicate covertly with the lower-level system while also preserving the performance, as the long-term behavior of ACK timings from the higher to lower agents via the Pump is consistent.

The paper introduces a notation, p(l, x), representing the probability that the NRL Pump will send an ACK to the lower-level system at time l, given the average acknowledgment delay time x. Different definitions of this probability can affect security and performance, and the authors intend to explore these variations in section 5 of the paper.

In discussing the operational details, the paper describes an automaton called pump2, which begins operation after initialization. This automaton can send a message to the higher-level system if there is at least one message waiting in the buffer. Following the message transfer, pump2 receives an ACK from the high-level system and records the timing. These timings are stored in an array, and there is a maximum timeout value, tmax, beyond which the connection is considered expired.

The paper also explores the relationship between decision-making times and the bit-rate of a potential covert channel. By waiting longer to make a decision (by setting a small decision threshold), the lower-level system can be more confident in its decision, but this lengthens the time taken, which reduces the bit-rate of the covert channel. The authors aim to estimate the probability that an observer makes the correct decision within a given time frame.
