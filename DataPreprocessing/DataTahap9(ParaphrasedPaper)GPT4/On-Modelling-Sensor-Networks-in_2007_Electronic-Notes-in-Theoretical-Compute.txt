Due to the inherent constraints inherent in sensor networks, such as limited node power, it is critical to monitor key performance metrics to assess the viability of network designs or protocols. An effective network model should allow for flexible monitoring and efficient execution, guiding the development of the model. 

In this context, a subcomputation of concurrent message transmissions reduces the overall state size by aligning state transitions concurrently, which facilitates both monitoring flexibility and execution efficiency. 

Utilizing time is crucial when optimizing a sensor network model for two main reasons. Firstly, time is a critical factor in sensor networks, with node battery life and various latency measures being important for evaluating network performance. Secondly, time is used to identify concurrent transitions, since transitions happening simultaneously are concurrent.

An optimized model would be suitably described with a real-time extension of Maude, a language that supports the specification and analysis of real-time systems called Real-Time Maude. 

To further optimize the model, one should adhere to a third principle, which suggests that the state representation should be kept as small as necessary. This principle can be applied in two scenarios: when message propagation is localized in particular areas, allowing nodes outside those areas to have a simplified state representation; and when a node's participation ceases, it might be possible to represent the network without that node. Optimizations along these lines have benefitted execution times significantly in experimental settings.

This study uses the flooding protocol in a sensor network as a sample to demonstrate modeling concepts and to test the proposed optimization techniques. Despite its simplicity, this protocol is useful for illustrating the modeling of wireless communication and metric collection in sensor networks. The techniques leverage the fact that any single transmission impacts only a subset of nodes, and provide a structured opportunity to observe the state at precise instances.

Pure flooding leads to a high collision rate and redundancy within dense wireless networks. To combat this, random delays and a limit on the number of retransmissions are introduced in a count-based scheme for cb-flooding nodes.

In the modeled state, two components are present: one representing the active network, with each node modeled as an object able to transmit messages, and another holding metrics that should not be attached to any individual node's state but are instead global network properties. These metric objects do not send or receive messages.

There are constraints in this modeling approach: node-objects' state may only change during a concurrent step, and metric-objects' state only during an observation. If a part of the state is not meant to change, the model prevents even a failed attempt to change it.

The objective of the flooding protocol is to have a message from one node reach all others. Metrics to measure include latency (the time taken to deliver the message network-wide), cumulative transmissions, and collisions.

A sensor network's multihop nature means distant nodes receive messages by transferring them from neighbor to neighbor. Levels of node engagement in message propagation differ at any given moment: some nodes are actively involved, others are temporarily unengaged but may engage soon, and some are entirely uninvolved due to their distance from the propagation source.
