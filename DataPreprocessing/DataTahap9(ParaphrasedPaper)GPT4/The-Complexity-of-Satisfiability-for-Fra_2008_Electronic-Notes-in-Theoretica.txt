The academic paper discusses the complexity classification of various satisfiability problems related to Boolean functions. Here is a paraphrased summary of the key points:

The paper acknowledges that there is an infinite number of finite sets of Boolean functions, necessitating algebraic methods to categorize the complexity of the associated satisfiability problems. In this context, a clone refers to a set of Boolean functions that is closed under superposition, meaning it includes all projections and is closed under any combination of functions. The notation [B] represents the smallest clone that contains the set B, defining B as a base for the clone [B]. This concept follows the framework established by Post for classifying Boolean functions.

Regarding a specific class of satisfiability problems, the membership in the complexity class EXPTIME is justified by Theorem 3.1(iii). To demonstrate EXPTIME-hardness, the authors show a reduction from the word problem for polynomial-space alternating Turing machines to the CTL-SAT problem for a specific type of Boolean functions (BF) and temporal logic operators, such as AX and AG. This result is then extended to show hardness for other temporal operators, namely AU and EU. The paper also determines the complexity for other fragments of the problem.

The last part of the discussion in Theorem 3.4 points to the fact that a significant portion of the complexity is derived from verifying the syntactical correctness of the formulas involved. To move beyond this and assess the complexity of the CTL-SAT problem for syntactically correct formulas, the researchers focus on these formulas, designating the problem as CTL-SATP(T, B). A subsequent theorem refines Theorem 3.4, specifically addressing subclasses within the computational class TC0.
