The academic paper discusses an extended definition of head normal processes to include all possible prefixes, not just input and output, because these represent different biological motifs or sites in a molecule. Traditional approaches that focus solely on homodimerization reactions, where two identical reactants interact, are not considered here. Instead, a more general scenario is presented. The process denoted by t[p] describes a transaction involving a named entity t conducted by the internal process p, while processes unrelated to this transaction are external.

The paper introduces a rule named 'par' which deals with four types of actions in the context of concurrent processes. One particular action is when l = comm(x) and l = (t: start), a new hypothesis, actt(q) = 0, is introduced. This hypothesis ensures that there are no ongoing transactions within the process q, giving precedence to the actions within the transaction over those outside it, thus upholding certain desirable properties outlined in section 3 of the paper.

In cases where l = (t: start), the beginning of a transaction is depicted. To accurately track the processes that are congruent with those involved in a reaction, a function called countt is utilized. The rate assigned to this prefix matches the rate associated with the entire reaction, emphasizing the significance of the transaction's initiation within the larger context of the processes.
