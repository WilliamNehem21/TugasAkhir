A Petri net is a mathematical representation consisting of a directed graph with two types of nodes, known as places (depicted as circles) and transitions (depicted as bars or rectangles). The connections between these nodes are arcs, each with an associated positive weight. Arcs connect places to transitions, allowing for movement in both directions. The system's state is indicated by a distribution of non-negative integers across the places, which are visualized as tokens inside the circles. System dynamics are driven by changes in token distribution, which occur through the firing of transitions. The foundational principles of Petri nets include:

In practice, setting an initial distribution of tokens can aid in activities like debugging. For example, when using a simulation tool to analyze a Petri net trace and an incorrect system state occurs (indicated by an unexpected number of tokens in some places), it is helpful to identify a subset of places and transitions (a smaller Petri net) that might be contributing to this incorrect state. This assists users in pinpointing the source of the error.

In a more precise procedure, the third step defines what is known as a "slice" of the original net. This slice, denoted N' and composed of P', T', and F', is a smaller network extracted from the original net N. It's constructed by taking the intersection of two sets of places (P1 and P2) and two sets of transitions (T1 and T2), and focusing on the relevant arcs (F) that connect the intersecting places and transitions. This intersection provides a narrowed view of the network that's relevant to investigating the erroneous state.
