In this paper, we examine the logic of provability and the proof theory within the paraconsistent arithmetic framework known as PRACI. This framework is built on the paraconsistent predicate calculus CI, which itself is an extension of the propositional C-system CI developed by Carnielli and others. We emphasize that the paraconsistent arithmetic systems we propose offer a fresh perspective compared to most existing paraconsistent arithmetic theories cited in past literature.

The core idea is to weigh paraconsistent reasoning alongside intuitionistic and classical reasoning, regarding these different methodologies as tools to study the same basic mathematical entities. Specifically, we investigate standard natural numbers within a paraconsistent context. To represent each natural number m, we use a term composed of m successive applications of the successor function s to 0, written as s...s(0). These representations are termed numerals. For clarity and convenience, we will refer to these numerals using conventional numerical symbols like 1, 2, etc., when it does not lead to confusion.
