The academic paper under discussion highlights the potential applications and recent advances in space solar power satellites (SSPS). Though delivering power from space to Earth is challenging in the short term, SSPS have other uses, such as creating charging stations in a geosynchronous orbit to power numerous small satellites. These stations can solve the energy needs of satellites in low and medium Earth orbits, underlining the importance of SSPS development.

Peter Glaser introduced the SSPS concept in 1968, and over the past half-century, there have been ups and downs in its research, which has focused largely on conceptual designs and experimental verifications.

In 2019, a successful experiment transmitted approximately 60 watts of direct current (DC) power to a flying drone 10 meters away using a phased array. At a distance of 30 meters, power transmission reduced to about 42 watts of DC.

The US Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) participated in SSPS development in 2020. A "sandwich module" launched aboard the Air Force X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle collected solar energy and converted it to RF power. Additionally, NRL conducted an experiment on the International Space Station to convert wireless signals into DC power using a light-emitting rectenna.

The space element of the Omega 2.0 system comprises three subsystems, including the hemispherical condenser and photoelectric conversion system, the transmitting antenna with microwave conversion, and a smart structure subsystem designed for high power-to-mass ratio. The system involves multiple challenges, such as coupled electromagnetic, temperature, and structural fields, and requires a multifaceted optimization design to maximize power-to-mass ratio.

The SSPS system also needs to ensure that the receiving antenna is far enough from the transmitting antenna since microwaves can't be emitted effectively at close ranges. Moreover, national standards dictate the allowable peak microwave power densities outside the receiving antenna for safety.

Heat management is a significant concern, as a considerable amount of heat is generated during the DC-to-RF conversion process. Innovative design concepts may alleviate heat dissipation problems, but efficient waste heat removal methods remain imperative to prevent the degradation of microwave power devices.

An additional consideration in SSPS is the calibration of beam-pointing accuracy. By using monitoring antennas equipped with microwave power sensors, developers can detect and correct beam-pointing errors, using both mechanical and electronic adjustments to improve accuracy.

The development of the ground-based SSPS verification system, Omega 2.0, received significant support from various members of the research community, including Jin Huang, Wei Liang, Feng Zheng, Liwei Song, Xianli Li, Na Li, Sihao Qian, Shunxi Lou, Chaoliu Ge, Guanheng Fan, and numerous Ph.D. and M.Sc. students. The authors acknowledge and express gratitude for this support.
