This paper discusses the challenge of congestion in mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs), where mobile nodes communicate wirelessly without fixed infrastructure, and proposes a new routing protocol called Early Detection and Adaptive Routing Protocol (EDAPR). The protocol aims to improve network performance by mitigating congestion-related issues, such as packet loss and delays.

EDAPR works by constructing a list of non-congested neighbors (NHN) and identifying routes to the destination that go through these NHN nodes. Nodes periodically assess their queue status to enable early congestion detection, allowing them to predict and signal potential congestion before it happens. Once warned, NHN nodes can immediately switch to an alternate path, reducing the likelihood of congestion.

The performance of EDAPR, which was benchmarked using the network simulator NS-2, showed notable enhancements in delay reduction, routing overhead minimization, and packet delivery ratio increase compared to existing protocols EDAODV and EDCSCAODV. EDAPR is designed to be cost-effective and to improve the efficiency of routing in the face of node mobility and the inherent limitation of wireless bandwidth.

In terms of technical setup, the simulations employed the IEEE 802.11 DCF MAC layer protocol and the 2-ray ground reflection model for channel propagation. The network layer's routing buffer could hold up to 64 data packets, and link breakages were detected through MAC layer feedback. The data flows were continuous bit rate (CBR), with various packet and flow rates, and the nodes could move at speeds up to 10 m/s during the 900-second simulations.

Overall, EDAPR offers a proactive and adaptive approach to congestion control in MANETs by leveraging the predictive capabilities of its early congestion detection feature and the flexibility of its adaptive routing mechanism, addressing key limitations of previous protocols and contributing to the field's development.
