In the most basic level known as the approximation of depth 0, virtual information is not considered, and valid inferences are solely based on the informational semantics of the logical operators. At this level, the system exhibits the subformula property and it can be determined in polynomial time whether a given statement is valid or not.

A k-depth approximation incorporates up to k nested uses of the rule governing virtual information. Each k-depth system upholds the subformula property, but the complexity of its polynomial time decision procedure escalates as k increases.

Intuitionistic truth in the context of disjunction (A âˆ¨ B) requires that at least one of the components, A or B, is true under intuitionistic logic. This holds a disjunction property specific to this logic system but departs from how disjunction is often used outside of mathematical logic. Michael Dummett has commented on this contrast.

An information state can be described as closed under implicit information derived from the informational meaning of logic operators, leading to a claim that such a state includes actionable information. For any formula A, one can feasibly decide whether it is true, false, or neither in our information state. Proposition 3.8 will support this assertion by explicating the implicit information resulting from the informational content of logic operators.

An extensive proof of Proposition 3.8 is provided elsewhere, showing that the subformula property crucially contributes to a practical decision-making process for deducing and refuting assertions within the logical framework referred to as 'intelim'. This proposition is also demonstrated alongside the mentioned claim.
