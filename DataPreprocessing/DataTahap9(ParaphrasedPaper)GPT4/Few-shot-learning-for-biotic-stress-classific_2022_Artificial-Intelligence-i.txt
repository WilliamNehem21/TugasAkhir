Plants are subject to a variety of stressors in their environments that can majorly affect their growth and yield. There are two main categories of stressors: biotic, caused by living agents like fungi, bacteria, viruses, and pests; and abiotic, induced by non-living factors like temperature extremes, water scarcity, and soil salinity.

Identifying and assessing the severity of biotic stresses in plants is a complicated process due to challenges such as the indistinct margins of infected areas, the variability within lesions of the same type, the presence of multiple lesions on a single leaf, and the similarity of symptoms between different stresses. Recent advancements in deep learning have shown promise in accurately classifying and recognizing images, and they have been effectively applied in diagnosing plant diseases, thereby offering valuable assistance to farmers and agricultural experts.

However, traditional machine learning and deep learning methods are hampered by the need for large datasets to achieve proper generalization. Emerging techniques, such as meta-learning and, specifically, few-shot learning, have been developed to create models that generalize well from a small amount of data.

Many studies have utilized deep neural networks to recognize plant diseases, often employing conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) across various crops, with some achieving accuracy rates over 90%.

In this research, we employ few-shot learning and feature extraction techniques to recognize plant stress and estimate its severity, specifically examining biotic stress in coffee leaves. The paper is structured into four sections: Section 2 outlines the basic concepts of deep learning and few-shot learning and describes the triplet network and prototypical network methods used here. Section 3 discusses the experimental setup and outcomes. Section 4 offers conclusions drawn from the research.

Pooling layers in CNNs downsample feature maps from convolution layers to decrease spatial dimensions while preserving key characteristics, mainly through either maximum or average pooling. The fully connected layers, essentially standard feedforward neural networks, serve as classifiers utilizing inputs from convolution and pooling layers.

CNNs can also function without fully connected layers, generating flattened vectors termed embeddings. These are particularly useful in few-shot learning.

Few-shot learning (FSL), a subset of meta-learning, aims to address the challenge of needing large datasets for machine and deep learning. FSL techniques leverage deep learning architectures to fine-tune models or optimize the learning process with minimal data. Learning to compare models by assessing image similarity helps generalize learning with limited data and is known as embedding learning methods.

Our research focuses on distance metric learning-based methods, as they've shown impressive results in image classification tasks. We're particularly interested in the triplet network and prototypical network, both relying on comparing distances between image embeddings.

Finally, we discuss our experiments, which involved applying the few-shot learning approaches of the triplet network and prototypical network to classify plant stresses and assess severity using datasets of coffee leaf images with biotic stress. The datasets, available on GitHub, originate from a previous study by Krohling et al. (2019). We report on three experimental scenarios addressing classification and severity estimation tasks. The findings show promise for the few-shot learning approach, notably outperforming results from previous research, especially in severity estimation tasks.
