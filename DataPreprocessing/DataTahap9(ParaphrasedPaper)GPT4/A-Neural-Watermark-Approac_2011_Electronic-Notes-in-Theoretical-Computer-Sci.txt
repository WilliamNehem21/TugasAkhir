In this paper, the authors introduce a novel method that combines a digital image watermarking technique, known as Least Significant Bit (LSB), with a Multiple Classes Random Neural Network (MCRNN) to enhance the detection of watermarked images and their resilience to manipulative attacks. This approach leverages the MCRNN to learn and embed a watermark pattern, based on the LSB method, into an original image and subsequently detect it.

The LSB method relies on the human visual system's limited ability to perceive minor brightness variations, where the least important bit of each image pixel is replaced with the watermark's information. In this technique, the watermark is embedded by altering the synapses' weights of the MCRNN, effectively encrypting the watermark within the neural network. Consequently, the MCRNN is trained to recognize this watermark, and this knowledge is employed during both the embedding and detecting processes.

The proposed approach showcases a significant degree of robustness against common image attacks like rotation, scaling, noise, compression, and others, which might not be detected using traditional LSB techniques. This is attributed to the encryption of the watermark within the MCRNN's structure, rendering the method extremely sensitive to any alterations in the original image. In addition, the technique demonstrates excellent performance in terms of Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and noise generated, ensuring the watermarking process remains imperceptible.

The paper also describes the training phase, which serves to prepare the watermark for embedding and detection, and explains the role of the neural network's weights, initialization, and learning procedures. The authors specify that the watermark detection aims to verify that the embedded watermark patterns in the image have not been altered, using the trained MCRNN for comparison against the original watermark pattern.

The authors conclude their work by pointing out that their system can detect all tested attacks on the carrier image, unlike some existing methods. They also observe that the processing times for training, embedding, and detection are very short, with the most extended training time recorded being 1235 milliseconds for a 16x16 pixel watermark.

Finally, the authors propose future research directions, including developing new prototypes to apply their model to other digital media like text, audio, and video for broader applications in computer security. They also suggest extending their system to work with different image formats beyond BMP, such as JPG, GIF, and PNG.
