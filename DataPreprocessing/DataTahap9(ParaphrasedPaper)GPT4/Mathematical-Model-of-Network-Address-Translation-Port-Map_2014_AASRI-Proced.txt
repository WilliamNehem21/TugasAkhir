The paper discusses the importance of Network Address Translation (NAT) traversal in achieving real-time video streaming between two points in a network. It identifies the prediction of NAT port mappings as a key element in this process. However, it points out that existing algorithms that attempt to predict these mappings are often oversimplified or not well defined, leading to challenges due to the complex behavior of NAT port mapping in actual network devices. The research conducted in the paper involves an investigation into the complex behavior of NAT port mapping, and the development of a mathematical model aimed at improving the predictability of NAT ports. This enhancement in predicting NAT ports is intended to boost the success rates of NAT traversal.
