This academic paper discusses an approach for automating the process of constructing proofs in higher-order logic systems. The authors suggest that by utilizing meta variables as placeholders within a proof language's syntax, proof search can be simplified, relying on a proof checker as a foundation. They explore the method of narrowing search, wherein the proof term is gradually instantiated with more specific data, while ensuring it aligns with the formal semantic constraints.

The advantage of using the proof checker as the basis for proof search is that it reduces the potential for inconsistencies and ensures that the search procedure is both sound and complete. Moreover, by employing narrowing, which is first-order, the overall complexity of the search algorithm is reduced. The authors applied this technique in a logical framework that uses dependent types.

However, they acknowledge that practical application might be hindered by inefficiency. Experiments were carried out using an implementation that features a type checker built in Haskell, which initially did not yield practical results. Nonetheless, after introducing enhancements to the narrowing search and making minor adjustments to the type checker, performance improved significantly.

The paper also touches on the complications that arise in logical frameworks with dependent types, especially regarding variable handling, and proposes using de Bruijn indices to simplify representation.

While acknowledging their method may not compete with more advanced proof search strategies, the authors believe their approach can augment interactive proof environments by automating certain proof segments. They explore non-standard techniques, such as parallel conjunction and subproblem separation, to further expedite the search process.

Lastly, the authors present an experimental proof construction tool based on their approach, touching on elements like prioritization during proof construction and potential usability in contexts where cost-effectiveness is more critical than peak performance. Although the results are promising, they recognize the need for more comprehensive testing to draw firmer conclusions.
