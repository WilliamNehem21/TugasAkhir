The future of e-commerce and e-government hinges on people not only accepting internet technology for transactions but also recognizing the web as a secure environment. A detailed model identifying the determinants of individuals' acceptance of online transactions was created and validated. This research seeks to blend the established Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) with trust, credibility, and riskâ€”key factors in the prediction of individuals' willingness to engage in online transactions.

Preparing a nation or society for the information highway, leading to greater economic and social advancement, is complex. It involves learning from other experiences and enhancing education and curriculum. Adapting research models to align with local cultural values and environment is essential.

The 2005 CITC Annual Report predicts a bright future for internet usage in Saudi Arabia, driven by a young population embracing technology and an increase in Arabic web content.

In 2004, a decree by the Saudi Crown Prince led to the development of a national IT plan (NITP), approved by the Saudi government in 2007. The plan promotes knowledge and economic growth through scientific and technological innovation, with initiatives that include a 25% salary incentive for IT specialists and a policy providing a personal computer for each Saudi household.

Credibility is crucial for e-transaction acceptance and is considered a distinct concept from trust by this study. The proposed e-transaction acceptance model integrates trust, perceived credibility, and perceived risk, which are crucial when dealing with uncertainty.

Online transaction processes often start with information exchange and can progress to personal data provision. However, these processes might be abandoned mid-way. Issues related to e-commerce are also relevant for predicting public concerns regarding technology acceptance in e-government transactions.

Unique aspects of online transactions include the heavy use of technology, the impersonal nature of digital environments, and the inherent uncertainty in open technological structures. Concerns about trust and risk are critical in predicting b2c e-commerce acceptance. Understanding the roles of trust, credibility, and perceived risk is vital for facilitating consumer acceptance.

The TAM is effective for various information technologies, including e-commerce. It helps predict online transaction behavior and has been validated in several studies. This study positions credibility as a signal for trustworthiness, guiding the direction of causality between these two factors.

Tests of the measurement model confirm robust internal consistency and convergent validity of the measures. Demographic factors such as age, gender, and education level significantly influence perceived credibility, trust, and risk.

The study supports TAM's applicability in predicting online transaction intentions in Saudi Arabia, with perceived usefulness and ease of use as significant predictors. TAM is enhanced with constructs specific to e-transactions and demographics to provide a comprehensive view of e-transaction acceptance in the Saudi context.

This research aims to improve the understanding of online behavior in e-commerce and e-government and assist Saudi policymakers in transitioning to a digital economy and information society. Media efforts should highlight the benefits of e-transactions and promote the legislation governing information transactions, while proactive policies can help encourage the widespread adoption of e-commerce and e-government.
