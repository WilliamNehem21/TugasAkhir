The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 outlines the symbols used and the fundamental method for completion. Following this, Section 3 details the key theoretical contributions of the paper. Section 4 then discusses various examples and their associated security concerns. The paper wraps up with a conclusion in Section 5.

It is important to note the criterion mentioned earlier does not account for managing non-left linear XOR rules. Previous works limited XOR operations to 'typed' terms to address non-left linear XOR rules, yet there are known instances where protocols are vulnerable to type confusion attacks. Our method, presented here, is applicable to any type of term rewriting systems, including those with properties such as exponentiation, allowing for the analysis of protocols based on Diffie-Hellman.

Historically, regular approximation has proven useful for the analysis of security protocols. This paper expands the completion process to handle left-quadratic rules, which enables the analysis of some reachability problems using polynomial steps for computing automatons, as opposed to exponential steps required for automaton determinization, which can become impractical. The proposed approach, while presented for quadratic rules, can be generalized to more complex term rewriting systems. There is an intention to further refine this technique, as even polynomial solutions can quickly generate large automatons. Implementation of these techniques in an efficient rewriting tool is underway to facilitate the backward analysis of complex systems.

Cibrario, I., Durante, L., Sisto, R., and Valenzano, A. provided a case study on the automatic detection of attacks on cryptographic protocols, which was discussed during the second international conference on Intrusion and Malware Detection and Vulnerability Assessment, as published in volume 3548 of LNCS, held in Vienna, in 2005.
