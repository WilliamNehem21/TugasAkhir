The organization of this academic paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 outlines the definitions of terms and substitutions, and presents strong structural induction principles with the variable convention included. Section 3 details the types and typing judgments applicable to terms. Section 4 describes the big-step evaluation relationship between terms, and Section 5 discusses the approach to demonstrating the termination property associated with this evaluation relationship.

Later in the paper, the authors introduce the concept of simultaneous substitution, depicted as finite lists of (name, term) pairs. This representation is chosen over potentially infinite ones because it is more manageable in the Nominal Isabelle framework and simpler to construct recursive functions over lists than over sets.

Typing judgments require prior definition of typing contexts, which are similarly constructed as finite lists of (name, type) pairs. Although this introduces order sensitivity in how variables are linked to types, such lists are preferred within Nominal Isabelle due to their finiteness and simplicity compared to sets, which could be infinitely large.

The lemma's proof is not trivial, as automated proof search tools in Isabelle may not efficiently identify the required proof. A more robust result must be proven, employing the well-established method of logical relations. The paper specifically turns to the notion of a valuation, defined as sets of terms that meet certain criteria.

The lemma's proof involves a standard case analysis on the extended typing context and simultaneous substitution. This leads to Theorem 5.1, where the termination is proven not only for closed expressions but for all typable terms.

The authors acknowledge inspiration from Adam Chlipala, who initially posted some of the problems as a challenge on the POPLmark mailing list. Additionally, they express gratitude to Nick Benton for providing a sketch of the proof regarding the termination property outlined in Section 5.
