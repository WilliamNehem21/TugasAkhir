In this research, advanced CRISPR/dCas9 technology was employed to explore the regulation of glyco-gene expression, specifically genes involved in glycosyltransferase functions and subsequent glycan synthesis, by the transcription factors HNF1A, HNF4A, and FOXA2 in HepG2 cells, a stand-in for human liver cells. Due to their central roles in crucial cellular pathways, the complete suppression of these transcription factors via CRISPR/dCas9-KRAB was avoided to prevent lethal consequences or significant impairment to cell viability, which would have hampered the study's aim to observe changes in the cells' N-glycosylation profiles after altering the expression of key glyco-genes influenced by these transcription factors. The genes HNF1A, HNF4A, and FOXA2 were thus individually or jointly downregulated using KRAB-dCas9 linked to their promoters, ensuring fine-tuning of the protein glycosylation process under normal physiological states.

Despite changes in transcriptional activity among various glycosyltransferases, the expected changes in glycan structure were not observed, indicating a complex relationship between glycosyltransferase expression and the resultant N-glycome in HepG2 cells. This inconsistency between gene expression levels and corresponding glycan structures has been noted in other studies, such as one where increments in certain glyco-gene expressions during the development of murine embryonic stem cells did not lead to predicted extensions in their glycan structures. In a significant case, an increase in core fucosylated and bisected glycans was seen without a corresponding increase in FUT8 and MGAT3 levels. Similarly, recent work by Nguyen et al. demonstrated that the overexpression of a relatively small fraction of glyco-genes could induce changes in IgG glycosylation in Chinese hamster ovary cells.
