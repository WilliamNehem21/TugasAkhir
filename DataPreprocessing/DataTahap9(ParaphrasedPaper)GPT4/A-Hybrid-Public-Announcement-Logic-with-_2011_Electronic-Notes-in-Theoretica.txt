This paper explores the fusion of hybrid logic with the logic of public announcements (PAL). To merge these logics effectively, the authors modified the hybrid logic framework to include nominals that only have partial state denotation. Elements such as nominals, satisfaction operators, the downarrow binder, and the global modality were integrated, leading to the introduction of an axiomatic system for the resultant hybrid public announcement logic (Hybrid PAL).

An essential feature of the paper is the establishment of general completeness for Hybrid PAL, achieved through reduction axioms. The authors illustrate that this kind of completeness facilitates the addition of distributed knowledge to the logic. Moreover, they demonstrate that distributed knowledge can be defined using the components of hybrid logic, specifically through satisfaction operators and the downarrow binder.

Initially, hybrid logic was presented by Arthur Prior within the scope of temporal logics and has since been applied across various domains of modal logic, including epistemic logic. Nonetheless, until now, the transition to a hybrid form of epistemic logic has not been commonly explored. This paper looks to amend this lack of development by combining Hybrid PAL with dynamic epistemic logic while adapting the representation to maintain compatibility with conventional Kripke models.

By integrating hybrid features into PAL, the authors argue not only for the enhancement of the logic's descriptiveness but also for improvements in proof theory, resolving certain issues that arise within classical modal logic.

The paper is structured into five sections: the introduction and axiomatization of hybrid logic that incorporates partially denoting nominals, the presentation of Hybrid PAL with a sound and complete axiomatization, the inclusion of distributed knowledge, and finally, a conclusion that reflects on the findings while suggesting directions for future research.

The authors conclude that the expressiveness of hybrid logic remains unchanged when combined with public announcement operators, as proved by general completeness results similar to those in classical PAL. This study opens directions for future research, such as extending the logic to include common knowledge or fully integrating it into dynamic epistemic logic, addressing the complexities that arise when epistemic actions cause the expansion of the state space.
