This paper dives into the latest developments in educational virtual reality (VR), with a specific interest in its application to the cultural heritage sector, highlighting the significance of the sense of presence in VR experiences. The paper is structured into several parts:

1. The introduction outlines the current status of educational VR and its use within cultural heritage learning, including an emphasis on the concept of presence.
2. An overview of embodied cognition theory suggests that learning involves both the mind and body, indicating physical participation can reinforce learning â€“ a principle compatible with VR's interactive capabilities. The authors build their VR experience based on constructivist theory, leveraging sensory feedback to enhance learning.
3. The authors describe their VR experience design process, including requirement identification, overall structure, key components, and control conditions for comparative analysis.
4. The methodology for evaluating the VR experience is introduced, detailing the questionnaire design, experimental execution, and the participants' feedback.
5. The results from these experiments are discussed, analyzing the effectiveness of the VR experience in comparison to other learning methods.
6. Conclusions are drawn, including reflection on the limitations of their study and offering suggestions for future research directions.

The paper underlines the value of immersive VR applications in learning environments and suggests they have the potential to be as or more effective than traditional methods due to the high levels of immersion and the ability to guide users through specific learning paths. The authors used historical content from various sources to create an engaging VR experience and reduced cognitive load by presenting the information in users' native language.

They also focused on preventing cybersickness by limiting movement to teleportation and keeping the experience duration short. Regarding their experimental approach, they faced challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic but employed a hybrid data collection method.

Initial findings revealed that the VR experience was effective for learning with high marks for user experience and presence, although there were some unexpected results in spatial reconstruction tasks. Limitations of their study included a small participant sample size and a limited age range, affected by pandemic-related restrictions.

Finally, they propose future research to improve their VR application, explore its effectiveness in different settings like museum exhibits or classrooms, and investigate the impact of more interactive elements on learning outcomes.
