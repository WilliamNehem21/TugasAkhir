For one specific protein structure (coded 7KHH), there were no pre-existing Protein Data Bank (PDB) entries that could provide an initial model, so we estimated the structure of the attached warhead by using a method called “docking” with the program GNINA. We checked the accuracy of our model by visually assessing it and comparing it to known structures. The non-hydrogen atoms of the molecules we studied were saved in a specific format (SDF) for later analysis.

We also provide a detailed description of the protein structures analyzed in this research, including the PDB IDs, gene names, and various other critical molecular details.

We understood that to determine how two proteins might form a ternary complex, we needed to evaluate various interaction positions. We assumed each protein remains rigid during the docking process and sought potential orientations for forming the complex.

We applied a "protein-protein interaction (PPI) fitness" scoring mechanism, which helped us avoid considering protein poses that are either too close, causing steric clashes, or too far apart from each other. Although in known crystal structures, high surface contact is not always observed, we limited our scoring method to avoid a bias toward poses unlike those seen in nature.

Subsequently, we created conformations of a molecule (PROTAC) that connects the two proteins, using the Universal Force Field (UFF) and constraining certain atoms during the process.

After generating several candidate structures, we chose the one with the lowest energy as our final model, as this number of candidates seemed sufficient for reliably identifying the minimum energy structure.

It's important to note that our score didn't take into account the interactions of the molecule with proteins, which meant it couldn't identify clashes between them. Another score, the PROTAC stability score, accounted for such clashes.

Since our optimization technique was computationally demanding and the scoring results were not an explicit function of the inputs, we trained a neural network to predict the energy and refined it for the complex molecular interactions that might occur.

We used a blackbox optimization method called "Bayesian optimization" because we don't have an easy way to calculate gradients analytically. To pick the next points to evaluate, we used the UCB acquisition function within our algorithm.

Only complexes with PPI scores above a certain threshold and energy levels less than a set multiple of the lowest observed energy were retained for further evaluation, which included optimizing real-world poses using simulated annealing.

We calculated average distances between active sites on proteins to help set specific parameters needed for the simulation of each tertial complex.

The refined structures of the protein complexes were then clustered and ranked according to size, using a specific method based on shared contacts.

We also measured how closely our candidate structures matched known structures using a scoring system called DockQ, which considers both the structure and how closely it represents the target, combining these measures into a single score.

For each complex studied, we selected the cluster with the most near-native structural poses, as indicated by high DockQ scores. In cases where no near-native complexes were found, no selection was possible.

While refining these structures computationally is still an intensive task, we believe that our scoring and sampling techniques provide valuable insights into the potential interactions within a given complex.

We made specific assumptions in predicting the complex structures: that there would be no significant changes in the protein backbones and that we would know the binding details for parts of the complex. The alignment of side-chains could affect our score predictions, and these limitations became evident in specific cases where input alignments impacted our results.

Our future research aims to include more refined PPI and constraint scores in our optimization loop, which should help identify more accurate native poses. Initial results indicate that including side-chain flexibility could lead to significant improvements, hopeful evidence for the efficacy of our approach.
