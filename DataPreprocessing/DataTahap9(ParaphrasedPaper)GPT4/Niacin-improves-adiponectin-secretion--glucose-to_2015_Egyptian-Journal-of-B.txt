The research study involved 21 teenage rats divided into two dietary groups: a high-fat diet (HFD) group with 14 rats and a control group with 7 rats. After 8 weeks on these diets, half the rats from the HFD group were switched to a diet that included niacin supplements (1 mg niacin/kg diet), while the rest continued on the HFD for an additional 6 weeks. The HFD group developed obesity-related symptoms such as increased body weight, impaired glucose tolerance, reduced insulin sensitivity, and altered lipid profiles when compared with the control group. However, the group that received niacin supplements demonstrated a reduction in weight gain and improved insulin sensitivity and glucose control. Furthermore, their levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL approached those of the control rats, indicating an ameliorating effect of niacin. Despite niacin's beneficial impact on cholesterol, it did not significantly affect hypertriglyceridemia.

Adipose tissue secretes various bioactive substances, with adiponectin being the most abundant one having anti-inflammatory, insulin-sensitizing, and antiatherogenic properties. Adiponectin influences glucose regulation and fatty acid oxidation, helping to prevent insulin resistance and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). The HFD group showed elevated plasma cholesterol levels, but niacin-supplemented rats had significantly reduced cholesterol. Although previous studies showed inconsistent effects of niacin treatment on glucose control and insulin sensitivity in obese versus non-obese subjects, the current study observed enhanced insulin sensitivity with niacin supplementation.

Niacin's beneficial effects in the study are partially attributed to increased serum adiponectin levels, suggesting that niacin might improve glucose control and insulin sensitivity by influencing adiponectin signaling. The research underscores the potential role of niacin in moderating the negative impact of dyslipidemia on glucose metabolism by potentially restoring insulin sensitivity and promoting metabolic homeostasis in obese conditions.
