This paper discusses the concept of Communication and Sensing Integrated Networks (CSINs), which offer simultaneous digital space perception and pervasive intelligent communication. The study introduces an Enhanced High-Frequency Wireless Network (E-HFWN) as a technical framework to integrate communication and sensing, exploring its key technologies and performance metrics, such as air interface technologies involving frame design, carrier aggregation, channel sensing, physical layer mapping, beamforming, resource distribution, and management.

A novel resource allocation approach using actor-critic reinforcement learning (RL) is proposed to optimize wireless resource sharing, aiming to maximize Mutual Information (MI) while reducing end-to-end latency at sensing terminals. The effectiveness of E-HFWN is then evaluated through simulations across various metrics, including system capacity, peak rates, end-to-end delay, and waveform sidelobe ratio in communication and sensing.

The study emphasizes the enhanced sensing features of E-HFWN, which can contribute to AI-driven services and applications, providing beneficial data for AI models and potentially impacting 6G and beyond. AI and RL are shown to play a significant role in channel resource allocation and scheduling for communication and sensing.

Impacts on future smart factory environments are also discussed, addressing the challenges of network congestion and the necessity to efficiently manage densely connected terminal nodes. The paper suggests that sophisticated beamforming and management strategies can optimize communication and sensing functions while adhering to CSIN performance requirements.
