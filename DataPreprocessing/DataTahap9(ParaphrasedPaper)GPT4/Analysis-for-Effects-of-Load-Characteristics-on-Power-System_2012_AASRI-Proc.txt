This paper investigates the impact of varying load characteristics on the voltage stability of power systems. These variations can occur over time and have the potential to affect system stability. To study this effect, static ZIP load models, which represent different load characteristics, are utilized alongside the P-V curve method to analyze system voltage stability during both standard operations and emergency situations. This enables the determination of the maximum real power transfer capacity of the system.

The research focuses on comparing the effects of different load models, specifically three composite types and three singular types, on the voltage stability of a large-scale power system. The study's findings are intended to inform system planning and operational strategies.

Voltage instability often arises from gradual changes in network conditions and load properties. Power system loads consist of various connected devices within subtransmission and distribution networks, which are linked to the primary transmission and generation networks. Accurately identifying the makeup of these loads is crucial, as illustrated by earlier studies conducted by multiple researchers.

This paper seeks to analyze how different load characteristics influence voltage stability within power systems. Load characteristics can be categorized by static and dynamic models. The study specifically focuses on static ZIP models and applies the P-V curve method to evaluate voltage stability under normal and contingency scenarios, aiming to ascertain the limits of real power and reactive power margins at the buses.

The primary goal is to assess the effect of load properties on voltage stability using P-V curve analysis for both typical operations and in the face of network contingencies. The paper introduces three distinct load models for this purpose: Model 1 with a high proportion of constant impedance, Model 2 with a high proportion of constant current, and Model 3 with a high proportion of constant power. The outcomes suggest that in the face of single or double component failures (N-1 or N-2 contingencies), the real power transfer capacity ranking from highest to lowest margin is Model 1, followed by Model 2, and then Model 3.
