This paper delves into a novel risk model relevant to real-world scenarios such as automobile accidents, where a primary claim can lead to two types of secondary claims, which could either be immediate or delayed. The study explores the surplus prior to ruin and the deficit at ruin when the initial surplus is zero, including a recursive formula for computing the joint distribution when there's an initial surplus (u). Additionally, the research offers the method to calculate the ruin probability when starting with a nonzero initial surplus. The paper differentiates its model from previous ones by incorporating two kinds of by-claims stemming from one main claim.
