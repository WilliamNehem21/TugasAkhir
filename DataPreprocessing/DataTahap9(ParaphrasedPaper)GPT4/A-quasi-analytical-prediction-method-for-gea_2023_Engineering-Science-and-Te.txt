To minimize the negative impact of fluid pressure on the performance of high-speed gear systems, particularly in helicopter main reducers, shrouds are implemented to contain and closely approach the gears, substantially influencing losses due to windage and pumping in both axial and radial dimensions. This study introduces an advanced, quasi-analytical approach for quantifying such power losses, considering the compressibility of air or air-oil mixtures and the pumping behavior of gears. The refined model's theoretical predictions are validated with existing experimental data. As the shroud gets closer to the gears, a better comprehension of the fluid dynamics within the tooth spaces is achieved, shedding light on load-independent losses.

Windage and churning losses, which scale with the cube of rotational speed, represent over half of the total energy dissipation in gear systems when speeds exceed 100 m/s, showcasing the importance of shrouding to reduce these losses and boost efficiency. The paper targets the precise forecasting of power losses caused by the interaction of the shroud with the gear pair.

Previous research by Al et al. used a 2D CFD approach to study pressure fluctuations on gear teeth during operation, while Burberi et al. investigated gear dynamics partly submerged in oil via dynamic mesh techniques considering fluid flow as isothermal and incompressible. Leveraging the concept of gear pump swept volume, this study examines the squeezing and pocketing of fluids in shrouded gear teeth spaces to anticipate load-independent power losses more accurately, which is an area of research that has been relatively unexplored until now.

The proposed methodology takes into account the compressibility and subsonic flow characteristics of the air or air-oil mixture, as well as the influence of gear geometry, operational parameters, and environmental conditions to predict total power losses due to windage and pumping effects.

As the gears rotate within the shroud, the entire assembly functions analogously to a gear pump, emphasizing the significance of the shroud-to-gear clearance in understanding and predicting losses. The study also outlines how variations in the volume of the tooth spaces influence power loss computations, with specific reference to pinion rotation speeds and the dimensions of the clearance between components.

The improved quasi-analytical model presented in this paper is adept at estimating total losses, including those from pumping and windage, across various speeds. Notably, when the pitch line velocity surpasses 127 m/s (8681 r/min), the model indicates that pumping losses exceed 11.3 kW, becoming a substantial component of the total power losses.

The paper recognizes limitations, such as the potential for lubricant leakage in scenarios with larger clearances between gears and the shroud, which may affect computational accuracy. Future research efforts will focus on the air flow's influence on tightly shrouded gear pairs and the impact of lubricant leakage on model precision.
