In our study, we focus on the Wadge reducibility of k-partitions within the realms of Baire and Cantor spaces. To the best of our understanding, the initial finding regarding this type of reducibility for k-partitions in the mentioned spaces can be found in Theorem 3.2 of the referenced work. The statement that follows serves as a specific instance derived from that theorem.
