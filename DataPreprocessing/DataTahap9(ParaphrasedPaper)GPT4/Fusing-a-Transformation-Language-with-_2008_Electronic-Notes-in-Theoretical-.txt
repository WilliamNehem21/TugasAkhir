The paper talks about a prototype system designed to handle analysis and transformation tasks specific to a programming framework. Section 4 details the prototype's implementation, while Section 5 examines prior research. Section 6 weighs the advantages and disadvantages of the system before wrapping up in Section 7.

The prototype is available both as a standalone command-line application using Eclipse and as an Eclipse plugin. In stand-alone mode, it allows for source-to-source transformations where users provide a project path and a script to manipulate the abstract syntax tree (AST). In plugin mode, it operates similar functions within Eclipse. Patterns, written in prefix notation and potentially including variables, describe the structures within the source code which the prototype can traverse using operators: one, some, and all.

Named and parametrized strategies allow for the definition of complex traversal and rewrite operations. The system can also dynamically apply and update rules for ongoing analysis.

The paper illustrates how advanced framework developers could utilize the system for checking code style consistency, applying data-flow analysis through totem propagation, and optimizing matrix operation dimensions in code. It connects the AST of the Eclipse Compiler for Java (ECJ) with the term interface of the rewriting engine using an adapter.

Languages for refactoring, program analysis, rewriting capabilities, and other advanced features are compared, highlighting Stratego for its maturity and comprehensive libraries. A comparison with other approaches is made to emphasize the system's versatility in both analysis and code transformation.

Finally, the paper points out trade-offs with using a domain-specific language for scripting transformations, noting that the system's intricacy, while powerful, could pose a learning challenge. However, ample documentation and example code can mitigate this learning curve.
