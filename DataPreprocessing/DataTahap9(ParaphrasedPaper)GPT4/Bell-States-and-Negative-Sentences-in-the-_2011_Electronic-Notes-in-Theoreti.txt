We utilize Bell states to develop a composite distributed semantic interpretation for negative English sentences. Each word's meaning is a context vector derived from a distributed semantic model. The overall sentence meaning resides in a tensor space formed by the individual word vector spaces. Mathematically, the sentence meaning is obtained by applying a quantization functor from a compact closed category that represents grammatical structure (using Lambek's pregroups), to the compact closed category of finite-dimensional vector spaces that encodes word meanings. The meaning is calculated through the application of eta and epsilon maps that generate Bell states, enabling the transfer of information between words in a sentence.

The former reliance on the monoidal structure of quantales has been replaced by some theorists in physics and linguistics with the more versatile compact closed categories. Lambek applied compact bi-categories, called pregroups, to the syntactic analysis of various languages, including English, French, Japanese, Arabic, and Persian. Abramsky and Coecke utilized compact closed categories to devise semantics for quantum protocols, laying new groundwork for quantum logic. This crossover between language and physics is also evident in the semantic models used for natural languages.

Regarding semantics, compact bi-categories have been proposed for pregroup grammars from a logical perspective, and vector spaces have been employed to assign lexical meanings from a distributed viewpoint. Additionally, the quantum axiomatics of Hilbert spaces have been adopted to model the semantics of natural languages, finding use in tasks like web document information retrieval and identifying synonymous word meanings.

We aim to create a logic for semantic derivations in natural languages, inspired by D. Clark's work. Our approach includes a system for graded implication to gauge the similarity between positive and negative sentences. Meaning derivations between sentences use this implication, which signifies the proximity of their meanings.

The term T(B) denotes the freely generated compact 2-category over a partial order B. More detail on this is provided in the collaboration between the first author and J. Lambek. In the dictionary D, each element (w, t) is a lexical entry.

In the distributed meaning model, words have vector representations in high-dimensional spaces, with dictionary words as bases. Text analysis involves counting occurrences of particular words within a specific window of surrounding words. This count informs the context vector for each word's meaning.

For example, the word "dog" may be contextualized in a vector space with bases such as 'eat,' 'sleep,' 'pet,' and 'furry.' If 'dog' is associated with 'eat' 6 times, 'sleep' 5 times, 'pet' 17 times, and 'furry' 8 times in a text, its vector representation would be (6,5,17,8). This vector space model enables a notion of distance between words, allowing us to assess semantic closeness using the inner product or similar measures.

Large-scale computational models employ vast vector spaces and extensive text corpora. These models have been effective in creating thesauruses; for instance, the top ten nouns related to 'introduction' were identified as 'launch,' 'implementation,' 'advent,' 'addition,' 'adoption,' 'arrival,' 'absence,' 'inclusion,' and 'creation' in one such system.
