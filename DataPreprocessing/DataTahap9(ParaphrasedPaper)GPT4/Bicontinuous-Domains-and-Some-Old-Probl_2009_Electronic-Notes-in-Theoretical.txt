The authors explore the connection between the causal order in general relativity theory and domain theoretical notions, specifically focusing on how structures in models of spacetime, known as strongly hyperbolic, align with domain theory concepts. They introduce the notion of a 'strongly hyperbolic poset,' which is an order-theoretical structure characterized by its bicontinuity, meaning it is continuous in both the original and opposite order directions.

Despite the impressive terminology, the notion of bicontinuity in posets is not well-understood, prompting the authors to examine such posets further. They compile known results, present significant examples, and highlight how these examples relate to open problems in domain theory, proposing new avenues for research.

One area of interest is vector space orderings on ℝn, associated with particular types of cones that, under certain conditions, would lead to ℝn being considered a strongly hyperbolic poset. The authors suggest investigating these orders from a domain theory perspective and tackle some longstanding problems in the field.

They discuss the embedding of continuous posets into continuous directed complete partial orders (dcpo) through the round ideal completion technique, which depends on the geometry of the positive cone in vector space orderings. They propose a new completion procedure that might lead to embedding ℝn in a manifold with boundary and suggest exploring if this could apply to strongly hyperbolic models of spacetime.

The authors also explore the Lawson topology on continuous posets, explaining that it is Hausdorff and, on bicontinuous posets, is coarser than the bi-Scott topology. They prove that both topologies agree on bi-Scott compact subsets if the poset is locally compact. The discussion continues with the properties of interval-compact bicontinuous posets, the specific case of the 'kegelspitz' construction and its relation to continuity, and the possibility of finding counterexamples to longstanding issues through cone orders.

In conclusion, the authors examine the relationship between maximal elements and the bi-Scott topology and speculate on the potential of expanding the class of fs-domains beyond the retracts of bifinite domains. They encapsulate their findings by investigating the embedding of a set into a dense subset of maximal elements, demonstrating an association of topologies between the two domains.
