The primary purpose of the signature compiler (SC) is to create optimized backend checkers to validate proofs that are expected to succeed. SC is not designed to provide detailed error information for proofs that fail. Backend checkers permit additional definitions within (untrusted) proofs but prevent additional declarations, which could undermine the integrity of the (trusted) deductive system established by the signature. SC is most effective when used to verify numerous proofs related to the same signature, as the efficiency gained by reusing the custom checker offsets the time invested in compiling the signature.

The signature compiler incorporates necessary code directly to determine the type resulting from applying a constant specified in the signature. The argument types required are embedded within the checkers, and the checkers precompute the results of substitutions that would otherwise be needed at runtime for dependently typed functions. This design allows the checkers to bypass the resource-intensive substitution process when establishing the return type for constants in the signature.

The performance of checkers produced by SC has demonstrated significant speed and space advantages compared to checkers from Twelf and SC itself, as well as notable improvements over Flea. SC also supports a form of implicit arguments, which affords additional enhancements in space and performance. Looking ahead, there is an intention to further integrate proof support from decision procedures. Specifically, one of the authors advocates for using the Logical Framework (LF), supported by the signature compiler, as a suitable foundation for a standardized proof format within the SMT-LIB (Satisfiability Modulo Theories Library) initiative.
