A large coal-fired power unit is a complicated system subject to nonlinear dynamics and various uncertainties, making it a challenge to analyze its energy consumption patterns and improve its operational efficiency. Optimizing the operation of a coal-fired power unit involves determining an ideal goal, such as maximizing energy efficiency or minimizing coal usage, under a range of constraints that include load demand, coal quality, environmental conditions, and operational parameters. The optimization model (1) can be clearly articulated, yet it's difficult to pinpoint the optimal operational targets due to changing constraints, conditions, and system characteristics.

Recent advancements in measurement, monitoring, and information technology have paved the way for better operation optimization in power units. This includes enhancements in data handling, gauging uncertainty, developing intelligent models, and creating expert systems. Techniques such as clustering and fuzzy logic have been applied to regulate processes and fine-tune specific parameters, including airflow and boiler efficiency. Neural networks (NN) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) have been employed to model emissions, like NOx from coal-fired boilers, with optimization of operating parameters achieved through Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) methods, providing a foundation for power plant operational optimization.

Within the SVR model, three critical factors—type of kernel function, parameters of the kernel, and penalization coefficient—significantly influence the model's accuracy, complexity, and generalizability. Therefore, choosing and fine-tuning these factors is crucial.

Genetic Algorithm (GA), inspired by biological evolution and natural selection, is an optimization algorithm renowned for its broad applicability, robustness, and efficacy in diverse areas such as machine learning, process control, economic forecasting, and optimization. It comprises seven key steps: string encoding, initialization, defining a fitness function, selection, crossover, mutation, and setting a stopping criterion.

For initializing GA parameters, one sets the population size, selection process, crossover method, mutation technique, and determines when evolution should stop. Specific methods like single-point crossover and basic mutation operators are used.

The case study centers on a 600 MW subcritical coal-fired power unit with specific configurations for its boiler and steam turbine. Several operational parameters are considered, including steam temperatures, pressures, condenser variables, exhaust gas temperature, oxygen levels in flue gas, and temperature differences across multiple heaters. GA settings for this study involve a population size of 50, binary coding for chromosomes, crossover probability of 0.8, mutation probability of 0.1, and an evolutionary period lasting 150 generations.
