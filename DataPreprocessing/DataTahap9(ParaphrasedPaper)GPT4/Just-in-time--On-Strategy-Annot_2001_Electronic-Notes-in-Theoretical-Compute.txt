The paper examines a specific type of strategy annotations that define a class of term rewriting strategies, including the leftmost-innermost strategy. The research presents a methodology for computing the normal form of a term using a bottom-up approach under certain annotation constraints. The primary contribution is the proof of correctness for the proposed interpreter that computes these normal forms.

The concept of "in-time" annotations is defined as those that evaluate the necessary arguments before attempting to apply relevant rules. The paper further introduces a default strategy annotation named "just-in-time" that meets the interpreter's required conditions. This strategy is shown to outperform innermost rewriting strategies in terms of termination behavior in various cases.

The paper contrasts these simpler annotations with more elaborate strategy languages from other systems that allow users to dictate when and how rules are applied. However, it notes that these strategies might not always find normal forms, which is a critical factor in complete strategy annotations.

The paper then compares the annotations studied to those used in members of the OBJ-family, highlighting similarities and differences, particularly regarding lazy rewriting.

An important aspect of the research is the memory-less nature of the normalization function, which provides additional insights into the strategy followed by the interpreter, even when divergence occurs.

Basic term rewriting and normalization definitions are reviewed, with a focus on rewrite rules and related concepts such as substitutions and redexes. The exact nature of a strategy and how it relates to strategy annotations is defined.

In examining the implementation of rewrite strategies, the paper discusses issues such as term copying and subterm marking, comparing the implementation challenges between simple strategy annotations and more complex ones like the just-in-time strategy.

Finally, the paper shares insights from the computational practice, describes the C-implementation of the norm function as an interpreter, and acknowledges the discussions and feedback that contributed to the research.

The overriding theme is a strategic approach to term rewriting that focuses on proper evaluation ordering to ensure termination and efficiency, balanced with the correct application of rules to move toward normal forms effectively.
