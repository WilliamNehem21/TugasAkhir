In the proposed energy recovery system, high-temperature waste gas is utilized to produce steam, which after working in the cylinder, is condensed into water. This water is then circulated to an air cooling tower where it is cooled, sprayed, and vaporized again. To efficiently use the potential energy from the height difference between the cooling tower and the condenser, a turbine is installed in the return pipeline for power generation, harnessing the energy of the waste gas and liquid.

The system includes a regulation mechanism that automatically adjusts based on user-defined programs and algorithms. To ensure accurate speed measurement and reliability, three independent measurement points are used, along with a fail-safe protection function that triggers an alarm if two out of three points signal an overspeed condition. This helps to prevent accidents and improves the reliability of the protective measures.

Simulations are crucial for analyzing turbine regulation systems, but they can be complex and lack portability. MATLAB, a popular system simulation software, helps overcome these difficulties.

An innovative single neuron adaptive PID control method is employed for the precise control of turbine speed. It self-adjusts based on the difference between the actual and desired turbine rates. If this difference exceeds a safe threshold, the system takes action to find the optimal working condition, adjusting the control servomotor as necessary to maintain the desired rate and optimal operation.

This paper designs a comprehensive governing system for hydroturbines and establishes simulations to demonstrate that the integrated system can maintain stable and optimal operation, mitigating large fluctuations and vibrations. This system aids energy recovery efforts and supports the shift towards low-carbon production.
