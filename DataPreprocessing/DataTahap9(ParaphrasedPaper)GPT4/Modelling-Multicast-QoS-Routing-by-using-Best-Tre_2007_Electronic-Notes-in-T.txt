In this academic paper, the authors propose a formal model to represent and tackle the problem of multicast routing within multicast networks. The model conceptualizes the network as a weighted and-or graph, in which the weights on the connectors signify the cost of transmitting a data packet over that particular network link. To specify and solve related problems, they utilize the soft constraint logic programming (SCLP) framework, which provides a declarative programming environment. The authors demonstrate that a multicast distribution tree, which spans from a source node to all destination nodes at the minimum cost, can be determined using the semantics of an SCLP program. Moreover, they introduce the concept of multidimensional costs on the connectors, where each dimension represents a different Quality of Service (QoS) metric, thus addressing a multi-criteria optimization problem involving factors such as maximum global bandwidth and minimum delay.

The paper builds upon previous research concerning shortest path problems and the use of non-linear clauses in SCLP, further developing these ideas to focus on the representation of trees rather than paths. Unlike other formal approaches dealing with QoS that use a hypergraph model and graphical calculus, this paper differentiates by applying SCLP.

The authors focus on the multicast scenario, where data must be transmitted from one source to multiple receivers (k), highlighting that employing multiple unicast transmissions can be inefficient as it may cause the same packet to travel across the same link multiple times. They promote native network support for multicast as a solution.

Various algorithms have been studied to approach the multicast problem, such as Shortest-Path Tree (SPT), Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), Steiner Tree (ST), and Constrained Steiner Tree (CST). SPT-based algorithms, like Dijkstra and Bellman-Ford, focus on minimizing the sum of the link weights from the source to each receiver to find the shortest paths. MST, as exemplified by Prim's algorithm, connects all receivers while minimizing the tree's total weight and follows a greedy strategy. ST and CST pertain to NP-complete problems and accordingly, numerous heuristics have been developed to handle these problems efficiently.

The authors emphasize that multicast QoS routing presents a higher complexity than unicast, primarily due to the requirement for shared and heterogeneous reservation styles, as well as global admission control. While some multicast QoS routing approaches use Steiner tree formulations or enhance existing algorithms to optimize metrics like delay, others, like the Delay Variation Multicast Algorithm (DVMA), aim to calculate a multicast tree that bounds both delay and jitter. QoS-aware multicast routing protocols (QMRP) is another example approach mentioned in the paper.

An and-tree is described as a special type of and-or graph where every node appears exactly twice in the connectors, except for the root node, which appears only once. The paper concludes by stating the multi-criteria nature of finding an optimum distribution tree, as it involves the independent optimization of bandwidth and delay, thus allowing for the potential of multiple optimal solutions with incomparable costs.
