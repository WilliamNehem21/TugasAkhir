In the paper by Shafer et al. (2003), the authors revisit the theory of evidence, which is also known as the Dempster-Shafer theory, originally developed by Arthur Dempster and later reinterpreted by Shafer. This theoretical framework is designed to integrate various data into beliefs or evidence to cope with the presence of incomplete information. The research expands on earlier work by Dempster, which Shafer himself has significantly altered. Denoeux et al. (2017) contributed two novel methods for division within the Dempster-Shafer (D-S) framework, along with simulations demonstrating applications of these methods. Additionally, Liu et al. (2017) introduced a new Dempster-Shafer weighting technique using a fuzzy algorithm that leverages evidence derived from various sources for classification purposes.

The paper outlines its structure, beginning with kinematic modeling of an agricultural robot and a MATLAB SimMechanics simulation, followed by a section on localization techniques utilizing both Dempster-Shafer theory and the Kalman filter. Results and discussions compare these two methods. Thereafter, experimental tests are conducted to affirm the simulation findings.

A key insight from the study is that an increase in the length of the agricultural robot results in a larger turning radius. The robot's steering angle, however, is mechanically limited, setting a lower bound on the minimum turning radius achievable at a constant steering angle. A dynamic and visual simulation is achieved by integrating the robot's model in MATLAB SimMechanics, where a sensor furnishes positional and angular data.

The efficacy of the Dempster-Shafer theory in precise positioning of mobile objects is demonstrated, with a real-world application to an unmanned ground vehicle constructed by the Biosystem Mechanical Engineering Department at the University of Tehran. The vehicle's motion is visualized in simulation, showing sensor data and the results of data fusion using both the Dempster-Shafer method and the Kalman filter. The paper indicates the Kalman filter's superior performance in environments with Gaussian noise.

For vehicle localization accuracy, Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) is suggested as an alternative to standard deviation. MAD is deemed simpler and more reflective of real-world variability than standard deviation. The study compares MAD to Mean Squared Error (MSE) and notes its advantages in terms of computational ease and interpretability.

The paper concludes by emphasizing the effectiveness of the Dempster-Shafer method over the Kalman filter in non-Gaussian noise environments, which was corroborated by tracking experiments with an autonomous navigation robot across two designed paths in crop soil. The experiments show that the Dempster-Shafer method outperforms the Kalman filter in real-world conditions, underscoring its reliability and superiority in specific data fusion applications for localization tasks.
