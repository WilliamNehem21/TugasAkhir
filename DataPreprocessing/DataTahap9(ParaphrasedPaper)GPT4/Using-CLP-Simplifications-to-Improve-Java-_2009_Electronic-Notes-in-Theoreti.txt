In a prior study, researchers created a termination analyzer for Java bytecode programs by translating them into constraint logic programs (CLP) and then establishing the termination for the latter. However, constructing a proof of termination for these CLP programs—often sizable—emerged as a critical efficiency challenge. This paper introduces several program simplifications that effectively reduce the size of the CLP programs without altering their termination properties. Specifically, the simplifications entail removing irrelevant clauses and predicate arguments, significantly accelerating the construction of termination proofs, as demonstrated by experimental evidence.

Although termination analysis has successfully been applied to logic, functional, and term rewrite programs, extending these methods to imperative programs—including those manipulating primitive values, lists, or more complex data structures—has introduced additional complexity. Termination in such contexts usually involves establishing that a certain well-founded measure, such as variable values or data structure lengths, consistently decreases throughout recursive calls and loop iterations. When dealing with arbitrary data structures, especially those allowing destructive updates, the approach must approximate the memory layout to ensure the detection of potentially cyclic structures that could lead to non-termination.

The presented research differs from logic program termination analysis since logic programs necessitate the clauses removed for handling logical variable instantiation patterns not seen in Java bytecode. New simplifications specifically tailored for termination relevance are introduced, and for the first time, their collective effects on Java bytecode termination analysis are experimentally validated across real, large software systems.

The paper elaborates on constructing a CLP by converting Java bytecode basic block path-lengths into CLP clauses. For instance, a sequence of basic blocks connected by arrows translates into a predicate with an arity determined by the local and stack variables in scope. The termination of the resulting CLP is then tantamount to the original Java program's termination.

A notion defined within the paper—if a loop terminates locally using its comprising predicates—helps identify the potential non-termination loops within a method. Additionally, the study includes a proof technique used in many termination analyzers, which shows that a clause participates in a loop if both predicates belong to the same strongly connected component.

The simplifications, when applied to the termination proof construction process, resulted in noteworthy reductions in both the number of clauses and the computational time required for establishing termination. Removing arguments from CLP clauses leads to fewer variables in the linear constraint data structures, thus enhancing efficiency, sometimes even enabling the merging of distinct clauses due to subsumption.

The performance benefits of these simplifications were empirically tested on a 2.4GHz processor with 2GB of RAM, using Sun JDK 1.5 and SICStus Prolog 3.12.8. The results showed that applying the series of simplifications markedly improved efficiency and reduced analysis time, with the original method unable to conclude within 15 minutes for certain programs, such as nqueens, jlex, and kitten. However, the correlation between more simplifications and increased efficiency was not absolute, as evidenced by the variable time reductions across different software programs.
