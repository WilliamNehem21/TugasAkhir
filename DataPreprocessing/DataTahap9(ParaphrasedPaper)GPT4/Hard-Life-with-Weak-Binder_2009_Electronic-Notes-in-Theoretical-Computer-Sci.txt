The paper presents an addition to the existing body of work in the form of a new trace inclusion relation for weakly bound processes. This relation, denoted as p ≤ q, indicates that the set of traces associated with process p is a subset of those associated with process q. The paper then contrasts this new relation for weakly bound processes with an existing trace inclusion relation for strongly bound processes.

Tracing preorders among processes are emphasized as an important and complex component of subtyping and subeffecting in type and effect systems. They are also noted as crucial for evaluating whether contracts are in line with their implementations and for analyzing subcontracting relationships in computational models for web services.

The paper introduces a specific preorder for weakly bound processes, denoted as p ⊑ₙ q, where n is a set of names that functions as an index to the preorder. This indexed approach helps to prevent confusion that may arise from name clashes. According to the paper, if p ⊑ₙ q is true, then the behavior, or semantics, of process p is encompassed within the behavior of process q, a fact that is further detailed in the second part of Theorem 5.7.
