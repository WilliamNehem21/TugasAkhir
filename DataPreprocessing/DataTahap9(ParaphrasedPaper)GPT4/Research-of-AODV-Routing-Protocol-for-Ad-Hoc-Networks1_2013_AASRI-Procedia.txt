The effectiveness of routing protocols in various scenarios significantly influences their performance. Even when applying the same routing protocols across different simulated environments, there can be notable variations in how well they function. Key elements influencing ad hoc network scenarios include the number of nodes, the rate of change, and the speed of movement within the network. Consequently, it is crucial to consider the specifics of the network environment when evaluating and contrasting various routing protocols.

In ad hoc networks, certain characteristics, such as their decentralized nature, the necessity for multi-hop communications, and the fluidity of the network topology, complicate the task of routing. Therefore, the central challenge in crafting protocols for such networks is to manage the intricacies that arise from rapid node movement, causing dynamic shifts in the network's structure. This paper surveys the AODV routing protocol and suggests an enhanced version, named B-AODV, which improves upon route discovery and the maintenance processes required for forming new routes. The innovative protocol offers better route repair capabilities, increases the ratio of successfully transmitted packets, lowers the delay experienced per node, and reduces routing overhead. However, the paper also notes that future research should focus on optimizing protocols for scenarios where network nodes are not solely connected by bi-directional links, but may also have unidirectional links.
