The paper discusses the differences between Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAM) and Decentralized Environmental Notification Messages (DENM) used in vehicular communication networks. DENMs carry event-related information and can be re-broadcasted within an event's area for further reach via multi-hop transmission, while CAMs do not have this specification.

Malicious activities in the network, such as broadcasting bogus messages and identity impersonation, are major concerns. The paper highlights issues with attackers spreading false information, either to create favorable conditions for themselves or to mislead other vehicles, potentially leading to wrong decisions. Ensuring the authenticity of message senders is crucial, yet challenging, since vehicles are not concerned with the actual identity of the sender but rather the trustworthiness of the message.

Various security solutions are discussed, including the use of public key infrastructures (PKI) and certificate revocation lists (CRLs) to filter out messages signed with revoked certificates. The paper mentions research employing two-way anonymous authentication schemes, elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), the Diffie-Hellman protocol, and HMAC-based methods to enhance security and reduce key management overhead.

Cooperative message authentication is also explored as a means to decrease computational load by having vehicles verify only a subset of message signatures and share their findings. Some schemes use cooperative message authentication in combination with batch group signature verification, which lessens the message verification delay at the expense of establishing trust within transient vehicle groups.

The paper recognizes the potential of broadcast message authentication protocols like TESLA for vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) networks and hybrid mechanisms combining ECDSA with TESLA++. Furthermore, it addresses the delayed verification issue in TESLA using a prediction-based approach where vehicles anticipate their future positions for faster message verification.

Despite the 3GPP's current stance on relegating security to the application layer, the paper suggests that providing security at the access layer may be more cost-effective and ensure compatibility. It also considers the challenges in scenarios without network availability and the necessity of robust security for direct PC5-based vehicular communication in autonomous mode.

Lastly, the paper highlights challenges related to certificate management and distribution during cross-network roaming scenarios and calls for a universal security approach that supports secure vehicular communication across different operators.
