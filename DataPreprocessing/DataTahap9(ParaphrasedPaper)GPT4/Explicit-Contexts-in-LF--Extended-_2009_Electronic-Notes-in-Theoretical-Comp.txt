In the study of meta-theorems using Twelf, issues can arise specifically with the hypothetical interpretation in situations involving dependent types. It is challenging to prove theorems that rely on specific bound variables (like substitution or functionality) purely through inductive methods. The upcoming section will detail these challenges.

The paper's structure includes a demonstration of the issues with bound variables and dependent types in Section 2. Section 3 presents the formalization of explicit contexts in the Logical Framework (LF) and illustrates their usage. Sections 4 and 5 describe the transformation of derivations between implicit and explicit contexts. The paper presupposes the reader's familiarity with LF and Twelf.

Although the substitution theorem can be easily proven non-inductively within LF, it is used here for its simplicity as an example. Section 2.2 will reveal more compelling examples.

The proof in question relies on a reversal of the binding order of the variables x and y. Initially, y falls under x's scope, but in the recursive step, y is taken outside of x's bind, which remains within the theorem's scope.

Different judgments on the left and right during substitution sometimes necessitate divergent typing assumptions. This can occur when certain variables or paths need special treatment, as seen in various module type theories.

The issue of hereditary substitution stems from the constraint that in canonical formulations of LF, only canonical forms are acceptable. However, substitution does not always yield canonical outcomes, so hereditary substitution is used to address non-canonical results from it.

Despite known ad hoc solutions for the first two examples presented, this paper introduces a systematic, reliable method using explicit contexts. Notably, Pientka's work indicates these issues can be avoided by altering LF encodings.

The explicit context method doesn't require changes to syntax encoding, which allows it to coexist with conventional methods using implicit contexts. The nature of Twelf's dependent typing is determined by the relationship between expressions and types.

The context formation judgement must also verify the uniqueness of each variable in the context, a critical factor for ensuring unique type retrieval upon variable lookup.

The rule used for typing a closed term 'b' also facilitates transferring assumptions from the implicit-context setting to the explicit-context one. This transfer is vital for integrating the explicit context method at any stage of proof.

The paper's central finding is the ability to transition from implicit to explicit context forms, conduct a proof, and revert to implicit form to achieve more general results.

The proof involves induction based on the term 'm' itself, not its typing derivation. Simple inductions and specific rules are employed for different cases, such as the variable case or the closed case. However, due to recursive calls in the 'of-lam' case, the proof cannot solely rely on derivations and instead must be derived from induction on the term itself.
