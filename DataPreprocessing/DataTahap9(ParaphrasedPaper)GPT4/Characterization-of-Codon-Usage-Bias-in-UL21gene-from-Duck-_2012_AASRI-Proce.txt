The academic paper discusses Duck Virus Enteritis (DVE), also known as Duck Plague (DP), a serious and contagious disease that affects birds in the Anseriformes order, such as ducks, geese, and swans. This disease poses a significant threat to the global commercial duck industry due to its high lethality across all bird ages. The causative agent of DVE is the Duck Enteritis Virus (DEV), a member of the Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily that has not been classified into a specific genus.

The study examines the codon usage bias in the UL21 gene of DEV and compares it with the codon usage bias in 27 other herpesviruses. Additionally, the paper compares the DEV UL21 gene codon usage with that of E. coli, yeast, and humans, which could provide insights for further research on this gene.

Codon Adaptation Index (CAI) is used as a measure of codon usage bias, with values ranging from 0 to 1; higher CAI values indicate stronger codon usage bias and are typically associated with highly expressed genes. In this study, CAI values for the DEV UL21 gene and related herpesviruses ranged from 0.613 to 0.768, with an average value of 0.681, suggesting that the UL21 gene is lowly expressed in the DEV genome. The small standard deviation in CAI values across different herpesviruses indicates little variation in the codon usage patterns.

The study also investigates potential differences in codon usage bias among various DEV strains by comparing the UL21 gene of different strains. The results show that the codon usage bias parameters, including CAI, Effective Number of Codons (ENC), and coding GC content, are very similar or identical among different DEV strains, leading to the conclusion that there is little variation in the UL21 gene's codon usage pattern among DEV strains.

In conclusion, the paper indicates that the DEV UL21 gene is expressed at low levels with weak codon usage bias and provides a foundational understanding of the evolution of herpesvirus UL21 genes. The research also offers a perspective on potential effective expression systems for the DEV UL21 gene, which could serve as a reference for future studies of this gene.
