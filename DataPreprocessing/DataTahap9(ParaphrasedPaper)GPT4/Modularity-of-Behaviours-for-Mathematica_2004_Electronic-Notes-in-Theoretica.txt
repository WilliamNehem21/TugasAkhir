To experts in coalgebra, the current scenario demands examination. The original transition systems can be viewed as a coalgebra for a specific endofunctor on the category of sets. The timed transition system is more intricate, but we demonstrate that it constitutes a coalgebra for a comonad that we associate with the time domain T and whose definition is both straightforward and concise (refer to Definition 2.5 and Theorems 2.4 and 2.6 in the paper). In the special circumstance where the time domain is the set of natural numbers under addition, this comonad becomes the cofree comonad generated by an endofunctor (see Theorem 2.7), though this is not typically the case. Consequently, there exist two monads D and D' acting on sets, both imparting coalgebraic structure to the same underlying set. It's worth noting that in many cases, D is the cofree comonad generated by an endofunctor B, and there is an interesting situation where D' is also a cofree comonad produced by a possibly different endofunctor B'. In Section 2, we delve into the analysis of time, whereas Section 3 is dedicated to examining the amalgamation of transition systems.

When the necessary products exist—which is rare and usually challenging to compute—we prove in Section 3 that the product fulfills our requirements. We introduce straightforward and broad conditions that ensure the existence of such a product. Furthermore, by inverting a result applicable to monads, we describe the product in terms amenable to computation, assuming at least one of the comonads is cofree on an endofunctor, which happens to be the case for all examples investigated. If both comonads are cofree on endofunctors, the scenario simplifies: their product equates to the cofree comonad on the product of endofunctors, which is defined pointwise.

We establish that examining timed operational behavior on its own can be reduced to understanding a distributive law of the free monad T over a signature against a behavior comonad ET, with a prime example being the cofree comonad on a behavior endofunctor. This sets the stage for our further analysis in subsequent sections on the merging of different behaviors.

In the upcoming section, we aim to merge the concept of time-dependent behavior from Section 2 with the conventional action-relative behavior as broadly explored in coalgebra. This synthesis allows us to subsequently probe the operational semantics of these combinations. For theoretical elegance, we frame our analysis in terms of two comonads, where one or both could be conferred cofreely on an endofunctor.

For all primary examples of interest, such as the set category with D and D' being any of our main examples, the existence of a corresponding comonad is guaranteed. An extensive discussion about the implications of accessibility and its relevance to substantial examples is found elsewhere in the literature. Interestingly, and quite fortunately, the assured existence of a comonad enables us to describe it as the product of D and D'.

In this pivotal section of the paper, we build on the knowledge from Section 3 regarding how to characterize the category of coalgebras for a product of comonads under mild assumptions about the comonads and the base category. We can then describe the product itself, provided one of the comonads is cofree on an endofunctor, as in our key examples. Moreover, Section 2 provides us with reasons for desiring such a product of behaviors. Now, we integrate that with the Turi and Plotkin approach to depict structural operational semantics via what can be proven as distributive laws. It is observed that in typical examples, time and action information significantly interact with one another. Hence we explore the following inquiry: Given a monad T and comonads D and D', what are the essential and complete criteria that separate D and D' while also allowing for an extension of the monad T to the category of (D, D')-coalgebras?

For the proof, we already possess the unit data, and the naturality condition is evident. The crux of the matter is determining the necessary and sufficient conditions for each element of the natural transformation to be a map in (D, D')-coalgebras; we recognize that maps in (D, D')-coalgebras are defined by maps in C that respect both coalgebra structures. Hence, it's a matter of routine verification to identify such a condition, a result that emerges from the literature and is also straightforward to see directly, as stated.

When it comes to lifting multiplication, the conditions can be stated readily if we are ready to employ that distributive law. However, this can lead to complicated calculations in verifying that specific examples meet the condition since the distributive law is induced by more fundamental data. Luckily, in certain cases, confirming the commutativity of the relevant diagrams tends to be fairly standard.
