This paper provides an examination of circular-arc bigraphs, a less explored specialization of circular-arc graphs adopting bipartite structure. Circular-arc bigraphs are defined by graphical representations where each vertex is uniquely related to an arc on a circle, with vertices from opposing partitions being adjacent if their corresponding arcs intersect. Previous research on this class is limited, featuring matrix-based characterizations and recognition algorithms for unit and proper subclasses but neglecting helly and normal subclasses.

The authors introduce a helly subclass of circular-arc bigraphs, adhering to bipartite-helly families' principles, as well as a new recognition algorithm executable in polynomial time. Additionally, alternative definitions for a proper subclass of circular-arc bigraphs and two different normal subclasses are presented, paralleling the concepts applied to normal circular-arc graphs. The paper addresses the relationships between various proper and normal subclasses mentioned.

In the research, arcs are treated as open arcs by default, with 's' and 't' denoting their counter-clockwise and clockwise endpoints, respectively. The paper adopts the concise terms 's-endpoints' and 't-endpoints' for these terminologies. It further establishes that helly interval bigraphs can be recognized by a bi-interval model that conforms to the bipartite-helly property and equates the helly interval bigraph classification with the squaring of the graph resulting in an interval graph. This equivalence forms the basis of the subsequent lemma related to helly circular-arc bigraphs.
