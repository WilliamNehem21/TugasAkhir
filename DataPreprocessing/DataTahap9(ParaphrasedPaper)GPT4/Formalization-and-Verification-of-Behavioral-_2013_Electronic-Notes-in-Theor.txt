Dynamic Software Updating (DSU) is a method for modifying live software systems without interruption. Although there has been research on ensuring the correct application of updates at the code level, such as ensuring type correctness, there has been less focus on verifying that the system's behavior remains correct post-update, meaning the updated system behaves as intended and avoids any unexpected behaviors.

We introduce an algebraic approach that allows for the specification and behavioral correctness verification of dynamic updates using available theorem provers and model checkers. This methodology can prove, through theorem proving, that updated systems fulfill their intended properties, while model checking can uncover potential errors.

Our approach is versatile in the sense that it can:
1. Formalize dynamic updates across three main models used by contemporary DSU systems—interrupt, invoke, and relaxed consistency—and
2. Focus on the designing of the updates themselves rather than their implementation code, which allows for general application beyond updates developed in specific programming languages.

By contrast, traditional static updating methods entail halting, updating, and restarting systems, DSU allows for continuous system operation during updates.

Currently, there are various systems like PODUS, OPUS, Ginseng, and POLUS designed to support DSU, with some tailored for updating software written in C, and others for either single-threaded or multi-threaded systems. Behavioral correctness ensures an updated system operates correctly under its new version, with desired properties aligned with the update.

Using existing algebraic languages like CafeOBJ and Maude, we can specify updates and verify properties. For example, in CafeOBJ, systems are represented with objects, process IDs, and program counters, all defined with sorts.

We have demonstrated that the mutual exclusion property is satisfied after an update through proofs and have also provided counterexamples to indicate when particular properties fail. Our study shows how updates might be redesigned to correct issues evidenced by these counterexamples.

Our work builds upon previous definitions of update validity and correctness, proposing 'behavioral properties' as a marker for correct dynamic updates, which is more general than only considering type safety. Furthermore, it contends that focusing on the designs of systems and updates allows for broader applicability.

In summary, we propose a general algebraic methodology for specifying dynamic updates and verify their behavioral properties, usable across various updating models and not limited to specific programming models. Future work includes applying this method to more complex updates, such as evolving from one authentication protocol to a more secure version while ensuring that essential properties like mutual authentication are preserved.
