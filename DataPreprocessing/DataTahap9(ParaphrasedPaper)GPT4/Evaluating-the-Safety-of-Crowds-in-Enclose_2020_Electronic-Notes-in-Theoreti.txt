This article builds upon previous research that utilized Markovian agents to model and analyze the behaviors of individuals in a confined setting during a panic situation. In this study, a more intricate scenario is considered where crowd movement in a stress-inducing situation is examined through the use of visual signals positioned throughout the office space. The occupants are assigned specific roles, and evacuation procedures adhere to pre-established guidelines that were communicated to each person prior to the event.

The paper by Abu Bakar and colleagues provides a review of different modeling techniques for simulating fire evacuations in enclosed environments, which include agent-based simulation (ABS), social force simulation (SFS), and a combination thereof. The authors discuss detailed aspects of human modeling, dynamic crowd simulation, and the impact of stress and fear. They also present leader-follower models as one of the various approaches for analyzing collective adaptive systems (CAS) by viewing group dynamics through the roles of leaders and followers.

Cellular automata are highlighted as an ideal method for representing environments in finite, grid-based terms, wherein cells indicate the local status of the environment that evolves based on predefined rules and influences from adjacent cells. This modeling technique finds applications in video games, architectural planning, urban traffic management, and artificial intelligence behavior models due to its computational efficiency and scalability.

The paper elaborates on the rich framework required for abstracting individual behavior, where each agent possesses autonomous decision-making capabilities driven by beliefs, desires, and intentions. Agents are capable of interaction, reaction, collaboration, or competition within their environment, and their individual progressions contribute to the overall emergent state of the system.

Swarm intelligence methods stand out for their ability to generate solutions that arise from the collective intelligence of a group of independently interacting agents. Markovian agents are particularly characterized by stochastic behaviors encoded within a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC), with the chain's infinitesimal generator being affected by interactions among agents. These Markovian agents also engage with their environment, which aids in a flexible depiction of obstacles, propagation dynamics, and other environmental factors.

The formalism for Markovian agents allows for the description of spatially distributed systems with finite states and dynamics governed by a transition kernel, inclusive of both induced and local transition matrices. Agents are distributed across multiple locations, thus making the Markovian agent model (MAM) suitable for systems where agent behaviors are location-dependent.

Parametric transitions incorporate events with variable rates dependent on the agent's location to model interaction with the environment. Although agents cannot directly alter the states of others, they can still be influenced by the states of other agents through remote connections.

The solution methodology delineates state space computation and transition matrix creation for each agent instance, with extensions beyond traditional Petri net techniques. By skipping remote places that only connect to test and inhibitor arcs in the state space generation, and by utilizing actual parameter values from topology definitions, the model effectively captures the dependency of each agent instance on the overall system state.
