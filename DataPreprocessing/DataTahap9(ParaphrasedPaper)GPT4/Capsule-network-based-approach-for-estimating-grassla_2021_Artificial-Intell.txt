China's grasslands represent the country's largest land-based ecosystem, making up over 40% of its geographical area. A significant portion (78%) resides within arid and semi-arid zones, playing a vital role in both animal farming and ecological preservation efforts. Grassland deterioration is an escalating global concern, with approximately 90% of China's accessible grasslands experiencing various degrees of degradation. From 1982 to 2010, the degraded grasslands in China encompassed 22.7% of the overall grassland space.

Monitoring grassland degradation accurately and promptly is often conducted by measuring vegetation coverage, a principal indicator of ecosystem health, via remote sensing methods. Two primary remote sensing techniques are spectral mixture analysis (SMA), which separates each image pixel into foundational spectral elements known as endmembers, and empirical models which establish a relationship between remote sensing signals and ground-surveyed data. These methods utilize satellite data, which includes reflective measurements in the near-infrared, red, and blue wavelengths, utilizing adjustments to account for canopy background variations and atmospheric aerosols.

When compared to other methodologies, a new proposed technique has elevated the precision of extracting coverage information for four different types of grasslands. The new method demonstrated an impressive grassland coverage monitoring accuracy, with a 96.32% success rate and a kappa coefficient of 0.9508. Even though Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms showed better performance in detecting bare land, their ability to identify low-coverage grassland fell below 90%. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, despite their extensive application in processing time series data, scored less effectively in classification accuracy, achieving less than 80% except for when assessing high-coverage grasslands, where accuracy peaked at 98.75%.

The study introduces a rapid and effective grassland coverage classification technique capable of distinguishing between high, medium, low, and other grassland types. It leverages Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) time-series data corresponding with grass growth cycles to predict coverage levels, applying a capsule network for image classification tasks. This novel approach obtained a classification accuracy exceeding 90% across all grassland types and overall accuracy stood at 96.32% with a kappa coefficient of 0.9508. Additionally, the new method surpassed SVM, Random Forest (RF), and LSTM algorithms in terms of accuracy in comparative assessments.
