The academic paper discusses the topic of refactoring in the context of object-oriented software development, specifically touching upon class hierarchies and modularization of programs. It extends the concept of refactoring to the restructuring of models, such as UML models and formal specifications. The paper provides an insight into the application of refactoring techniques to software and formal specifications without altering the observed software behavior.

Here's a paraphrased summary of the academic paper:

The paper explores the enhancement of software structure through object-oriented organization, analogous to the modularization seen in traditional imperative programming. Refactoring, a practice not limited to source code but also applied to models and specifications, improves software structure. The reader can refer to a comprehensive review on software refactoring for more information.

The structure of the paper is as follows: it begins with an example Object-Z class to demonstrate four distinct method refactorings and discusses the preservation of behavior during refactoring. Section 3 introduces the SAL framework and explains how it verifies the correctness of refactorings. The final section reflects on various refactoring types and the appropriate notions of correctness for them.

Refactoring involves altering software or specifications to improve structure while maintaining unchanged behavior. The paper uses an Object-Z specification as an example to explain some refactorings. Diverse refactorings may affect either internal methods or different parts of the class hierarchy, indicating that the scope of a refactoring could be a basis for classification.

SAL, developed by SRI Internationalâ€™s Formal Methods Program, is a toolkit for software analysis, theorem proving, and model checking, supporting various types of analyses through its language, the SAL language. The language is an intermediate one, targetting translations from high-level languages. It includes facilities for expressing state-transition systems and is comparable to other formal verification languages.

SAL language details include its case sensitivity, special syntax for comments, and conventions for reserved words. Basic types like boolean and integer are built-in, but custom types can be defined for compatibility with finite model checkers. To model transitions in SAL, one uses guarded commands, which offer a robust mechanism for encoding Z schema predicates.

For proper model checking, ensuring a total transition relation in SAL prevents modules from deadlocking, which is accomplished by special guarded commands. The paper also discusses transitioning from SAL specifications to handling limitations of CTL propositions and the nuances of translating between Z and SAL specifications, emphasizing the need for tools to generate accurate SAL code to detect flaws in refactoring methods.

In summary, this paper examines software refactoring from the perspective of object-oriented design and formal specification modeling, with a focus on behavior preservation. It also introduces the SAL framework for checking the correctness of refactoring efforts, emphasizing the importance of classifying refactorings based on their scope and the necessity for correct translation between different specification languages.
