The academic paper outlines its structure and main contributions as follows:

1. Section 2 describes the construction of apartness lattice-ordered semigroups, fundamental to the paper's study.
2. Section 3 introduces the concept of supermetrics, a key novel contribution, which are defined within the previously mentioned structure.
3. Section 4 explores the connection between supermetrics and additive functions, providing insights into their relationship.
4. Sections 5 and 6 delve into complex results concerning complete apartness lattice-ordered semigroups and their completions.

A significant featured property is referred to as (b2c), which bears resemblance to a characteristic of finite-dimensional normed spaces but within the paper's framework, where boundedness is determined by lattice order. By considering an apartness lattice-ordered (ALO) semigroup that satisfies property (mc) and an increasing additive function f, the authors show how to use metric space completion methods to construct an enhanced ALO-semigroup S1.

The primary focus of the study is the definition and analysis of supermetrics over ALO-semigroups, detailing the necessary conditions for distance functions based on semigroup and lattice operations. The paper presents results derived from these supermetrics and defines pseudo-supermetrics over ALO-semigroups, highlighting supermetrics as strictly increasing additive functions mapping to the real numbers. The research examines various ways of completing structures using supermetrics and proves that each structure with a strict, increasing additive function (equated to a unique supermetric) has an isomorphic completion.

Overall, this academic paper contributes to understanding ALO-semigroups by introducing and examining supermetrics, setting a foundation for other scholars to further investigate the properties and applications of these mathematical structures.
