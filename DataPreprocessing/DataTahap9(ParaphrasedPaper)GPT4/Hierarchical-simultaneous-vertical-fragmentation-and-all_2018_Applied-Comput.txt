Designing an effective distributed database system (DDBS) is a complex challenge due to various interdependent factors that affect its performance. This paper targets improving DDBS performance by introducing an approach that combines vertical data fragmentation with strategic fragment allocation across a network. The Bond Energy Algorithm (BEA) is enhanced with a new affinity measure to create more cohesive attribute clusters. By executing clustering and allocation calculations concurrently, the proposed method assigns each attribute cluster to the most suitable network site, resulting in improved database performance. The improved affinity measure considers both the concurrent occurrence and absence of attribute usage in queries to inform the clustering process. Additionally, communication costs are factored into the allocation process, ensuring that the resulting distribution minimizes query access costs across the network. The approach addresses the challenges inherent in distributed database design and shows promise for better fragmentation and allocation, which are fundamental for DDBS efficiency.
