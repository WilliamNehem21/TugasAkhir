In the article, the authors introduce a model for analyzing both dynamic and static aspects of websites, which can be formally verified. They conceptualize a website as a set of interconnected web pages and treat external pages as the environment of the website. The authors describe a logical framework to specify properties of websites and employ model-checking tools to verify these properties, providing counterexamples when properties do not hold, hence aiding in error detection and correction.

The paper underscores the significance of the internet and outlines the developments in HTML and HTTP as critical factors in the evolution of the web. The authors then detail a graph-based model for representing websites, where nodes correspond to web pages and edges to hyperlinks, also incorporating semantic annotations of web pages. Using Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), the authors specify properties and verify them through model-checking, looking at specific concerns common in website design, like connectivity and navigability.

Furthermore, the article discusses the scope of applying the model to larger portions of the web and potential optimizations using model-checking algorithm techniques. The paper continues with an in-depth explanation of the structure and elements of the modelâ€™s graph, taking into account URIs, links, anchors, and the semantic content of web pages.

In terms of practical application, the authors use Maude, a specification language, to encode their model and exploit its associated model-checking tools. They highlight future developments, including support for different markup languages beyond HTML, enhancements for property specification, and the exploration of quantitative properties of the web, such as the number of links or paths.

Finally, the authors contrast their model with other formalisms and approaches for web verification and analysis, suggesting that their model provides a more accurate and flexible foundation for applying formal methods, with the potential for future methodology development to infer information from verified properties.
