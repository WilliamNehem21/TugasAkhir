The article discusses the importance of feature selection in machine learning, particularly during data preprocessing. It points out that while current feature selection techniques can be effective, many still have shortcomings; wrapper-based methods often overlook feature redundancy, and filter-based methods can end up selecting redundant features. Wrapper methods are also computationally intensive, and choosing the optimal feature subset from large datasets remains challenging.

In response to these issues, the paper presents a new hybrid feature selection approach that combines Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Mutual Information (MI). This method selects optimal features from distributed datasets using PSO and then unifies these features using MI to derive the best feature subset. By integrating both filter and wrapper approaches and utilizing distributed computing to parallelize the wrapper methods, computational cost is reduced without sacrificing effectiveness.

The paper is organized to discuss related studies and existing feature selection methods, elaborate on the PSO algorithm, and then introduce the proposed hybrid feature selection strategy using PSO in combination with MI. Experimental results affirm the superiority of the proposed method in reducing dimensionality and redundancy in large datasets while offering improved performance compared to some existing filter-based feature selection methods. The proposed method, while slightly more computationally intense than other objective functions, proves to be advantageous in selecting the most relevant feature subsets.
