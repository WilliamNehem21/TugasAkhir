In mobile crowd sensing systems where multiple parties are involved, the potential for conflicts of interest is significant, particularly in centralized systems where some participants may suspect bias from the service provider. A system in which all parties feel fairly treated and can actively participate is required to address these concerns.

This paper discusses the drawbacks of currently prevalent centralized crowdsourcing systems, which are often reliant on a single point of failure and are vulnerable to issues like DDoS attacks. To mitigate these problems, this paper proposes a decentralized crowdsourcing architecture, introducing a novel block generation method and a trust mechanism for identifying and warding off malicious actors within the system. Various diagrams, mathematical models, and graphical representations are provided for a comprehensive understanding and implementation of this decentralized approach.

Apache Kafka, an open-source distributed streaming platform created by the Apache Foundation, enables the development of real-time, event-driven applications. Kafka operates as a distributed cluster that can be scaled across several servers or data centers, with support for seamless data import and export through Kafka Connect. Kafka clusters are designed to be scalable and resilient, maintaining service and data integrity in the event of server failures.

In this system, each node functions as both a producer and a consumer of messages. Producers publish messages to topics, while consumers retrieve these messages. For efficiency, topics can be divided among various brokers coordinated by Zookeeper in Kafka, and partitions of the same topic can be used by nodes sharing tasks or regions.

The paper details a secure message transmission method using encryption and introduces a blockchain-based platform for decentralized computation and information exchange. In this setup, a network of authoritative domains replaces a single decision-making authority, leveraging a chain of blocks for record-keeping and conflict resolution through consensus mechanisms. The addition of new blocks, containing message details alongside the hash of the previous block, requires satisfying a proof-of-work process.

The blockchain's distributed structure enhances security as it requires validation by the majority, making it difficult to tamper with. Each node maintains its own blockchain copy, adding redundancy and mitigating the risk of a single point of failure or successful alteration by malicious entities.

The paper presents a decentralized mobile crowd sensing (MCS) system that emphasizes continuous feedback between nodes, augmenting the work process and potentially improving the incentive compensation system compared to conventional methods. Security is further bolstered by an encryption layer, although the paper does not delve into reward system implementation details. Future enhancements may include mechanisms for better privacy protection, possibly by anonymizing transaction details amongst the many nodes in the system.
