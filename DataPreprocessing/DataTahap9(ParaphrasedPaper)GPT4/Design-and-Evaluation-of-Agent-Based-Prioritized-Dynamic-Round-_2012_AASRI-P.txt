Grid computing facilitates the sharing, selection, and aggregation of geographically dispersed computing resources for tackling large-scale and intricate scientific problems. Effective and efficient job scheduling within computational grids is critical, as it ensures the smooth execution of tasks. However, most existing scheduling algorithms fail to simultaneously address user and system objectives. This paper introduces the concept of fairness in scheduling and presents an innovative job scheduling algorithm: the Agent-Based Prioritized Dynamic Round Robin (APDRR).

APDRR algorithm combines the beneficial aspects of both the round robin and priority-based scheduling mechanisms using agent technology. It strives to maintain fairness from the user's perspective while optimizing for system-level performance criteria. The paper conducts a comparative analysis of the proposed APDRR against other well-known job scheduling algorithms. This evaluation uses several performance metrics: average waiting time, average turnaround time, average response time, total completion time, average bounded slowdown time, and maximum job stretch time.

The analysis is executed on a computational grid using real workload traces, revealing that APDRR provides superior levels of performance, efficiency, and scalability. This study also includes a statistical analysis of real workload traces to understand the behavior of grid jobs. Findings from the experimental evaluations indicate that APDRR achieves optimal performance, benefiting both system and user objectives by reducing waiting and response times, suggesting it is a favorable scheduling policy for both perspectives.

The paper extensively examines job scheduling algorithms within grid computing and addresses the challenges associated with the heterogeneity, scalability, and dynamic nature of grids. Notably, it delves into space-sharing and time-sharing scheduling policies, comparing APDRR with other traditional scheduling approaches such as First Come First Served (FCFS), Round Robin (RR), Proportional Local Round Robin (PLRR), Shortest Process Next (SPN), Priority (P), and Longest Job First (LJF).

The study concludes that APDRR is an optimal job scheduling policy that meets the dual demands of user satisfaction and system performance. The algorithm's efficacy is proven by its implementation on a computational grid using real workload traces, which positions APDRR as a significant advancement in the field of grid job scheduling.
