Different preprocessing methods are implemented in anaerobic digestion or mechanical and biological treatment facilities to extract plastics and other contaminants like metal, paper, glass, wood, and sand from household biowaste (HBW) using predominantly mechanical techniques such as shredders, screens, and extrusion dehydrators. The efficiency of these separation measures can vary based on feedstock quality, technical capabilities, and desired outcomes. However, these mechanical methods are unable to completely remove plastics from HBW, and their effectiveness has not been thoroughly studied.

Alessi and colleagues investigated how well four biowaste pretreatment plants could eliminate impurities, but it is still not clear how these processes might inadvertently add microplastics (MPs) into their final products. A thorough examination of MPs, including their quantity, distribution, and chemistry, is crucial for understanding their role in this context.

Using a digital microscope, MPs were detected on filter membranes and collected with tweezers based on their bright colors, uniformity, and high elasticity. These suspected MPs were then photographed, and details about their shape, color, and size were recorded. The particles were categorized as fibers, fibrous clusters, films, flakes, granules, or spheres, following previously established classifications.

The majority of secondary MP formation takes place in rough shredders, biomass crushers, and biohydrolysis reactors. After such processing, a decrease in fiber MPs and an increase in non-fiber MPs were observed, as well as an overall increase in the size of MPs. The results suggest that treatment processes involving shredding tend to create larger, non-fiber MPs rather than reducing them to smaller pieces.

Screening emerged as the most effective method for removing plastic debris, yet biohydrolysis reactors and biomass crushers were more likely to produce secondary MPs. It is important to consider the phase of feedstock entering the anaerobic digestion system from a design perspective because MPs can exist in either solid or liquid phases following preprocessing. Relying solely on visible plastic debris to gauge plastic pollution may result in an underestimate of MP pollution.

The study also examined how different rates of HBW processing in different settings corresponded to the number of MP particles introduced into anaerobic digesters, highlighting the substantial contribution of such facilities to MP pollution. Additionally, plastics not broken down in anaerobic digestion typically end up in incineration plants, adding to the count of MPs.

Plastics' physical and chemical properties influence their use and thus their distribution in various environments. Common plastics found in HBW include food packaging, plastic bags, lunch boxes, bottles, foam containers, and ropes. Identifying the shapes, types, and colors of MPs and plastic waste can help trace MP sources.

Lastly, the study suggests that while eliminating plastic packaging or HBW pretreatment may not be feasible, there are measures that can mitigate the risk of MP formation, such as depackaging at the source and implementing screening and manual sorting before other preprocessing steps, which can help reduce both plastic waste and MP pollution.
