This academic paper discusses enhancing the understanding of B specifications—formal methods of system specification—by employing UML class diagrams. The graphical representation assists stakeholders who might not be skilled in the formal B method, like clients and certification authorities, by making the specifications more accessible.

Initially, the paper introduces a set of guidelines for the initial conversion of B specifications into UML class diagrams, focusing on a structural view. Then, it examines the consistency of the identified object-oriented concepts using a formal concept analysis technique. This technique refines the class diagram by incrementally incorporating operations from the formal specification.

The research also acknowledges broader efforts to align formal methods with graphical notations like UML. It references existing work aimed at translating UML diagrams to formal methods to leverage formal methods' tooling while staying within standard industrial processes utilizing UML.

Contrary to these methods, this paper explores the opposite direction: using UML diagrams to document formal developments in a more intuitive way, facilitating acceptance by certification authorities.

The paper then elaborates on a behavioral representation of B specifications using finite labeled transition systems (LTS), derived through user-guided selection of states and proof techniques to determine transitions, which may also enable model checking for temporal logic properties.

The extraction formula presents a way to understand and manage a formal specification by identifying potential classes, attributes, and associations within a B specification through a concept dependence technique. The authors propose an approach that can discern the relevance of these elements based on their relationships with operations in the specification. This approach aims to capture the static structure of the specification in a way that is more manageable and intuitive than traditional formal methods.

The paper concludes by advocating its two-step methodology for class diagram construction, which it argues, through case studies, can provide results on par with or superior to existing methods. The first step generates a preliminary UML class diagram from the B specification to pinpoint potential concepts, while the second step refines these concepts by assessing their pertinence to the operations of the specification, resulting in a more pertinent and less cluttered class diagram.
