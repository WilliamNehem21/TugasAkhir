This paper discusses the mapping of the ArchiMate enterprise architecture language to UML 2.0, aiming to bridge business and ICT domains and enable the use of UML tools for ArchiMate models. It highlights the deficiency of UML in cohesively modeling different levels of an enterprise due to its large variety of diagrams with unclear interrelations. The paper emphasizes the strength of ArchiMate in integrating various architectural domains within an enterprise, proposing stability amid organizational changes.

The mapping provides redefined concepts of ArchiMate to align with UML, ensuring the structure, behavior, and information perspectives are translated effectively. Through a case study involving a simplified insurance company business scenario known as Archisurance, the author illustrates this translation process. Although the translation to UML can be done systematically, the paper notes that the resulting UML diagrams may lack certain expected details, suggesting room for further refinement.
