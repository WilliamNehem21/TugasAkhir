This academic paper discusses the properties of term rewrite systems (TRS), with a focus on reachability, joinability, uniqueness of normal forms, unique normalization, confluence, and existence of normal forms. These properties are typically undecidable for general systems but decidable for systems without variables (ground systems). There has been recent progress in developing algorithms and establishing decidability for these properties in certain subclasses of TRS with specific syntactic restrictions on variables.

The paperâ€™s objectives are to introduce new findings, review and clarify the existing knowledge on the decidability/undecidability boundary for these properties, and motivate further research towards a comprehensive characterization for subclasses defined by variable restrictions. Moreover, the efficiency of the proofs is highlighted due to the use of better reductions between properties.

The article presents that normalization is decidable for subclasses like shallow right-linear and linear right-shallow systems, which also confirms the decidability of the existence of normal forms. Additionally, for left-linear and growing systems, reachability and joinability are decidable. The paper does not explore the termination problem, although there has been noteworthy progress in that area.

An interesting point made through the use of reductions is that when starting with a flat system, the depth of the left-hand side of rules increases by one after reduction, while the right-hand sides remain flat. This observation leads to a corollary stating that constructed systems are "collapsing systems," which keeps open the decidability status of some problems. This corollary can also help prove undecidability for other properties not known to be undecidable in right-flat systems.

The authors dedicate a section to the proof technique, describing a method where a rewrite system (R(M)) is associated with a deterministic, two-counter machine (M). Under the assumptions that there's only one final state, counters are emptied before accepting, and no transitions occur from the final state, they derive specific rules for various cases based on the state of the counters.

Finally, the authors note that the reduction technique used does not retain groundness (the absence of variables), but it maintains other properties like left-linearity, right-linearity, linearity, and the noncollapsing property. It also retains left-flatness, and the newly introduced rules have right-hand sides with a maximum depth of two, but this requires a flattening process as a prerequisite.
