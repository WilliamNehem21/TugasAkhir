This paper seeks to address the knowledge gap in the current understanding of the computation of real numbers. Specifically, the paper reviews existing knowledge about the primitive recursiveness of real numbers from the existing literature, introduces new attributes of primitive recursive (p.r.) reals, and conducts a detailed analysis of how the primitive recursiveness of real numbers is influenced by the various representations used for them.

An overview of the different ways real numbers can be represented is provided in this section. It begins with a description of the classical forms of representation. Since the study is interested in how representations can be made more effective at different computational levels, all representations are redefined in a standardized manner, contingent upon a selected class 'F' of functions. This reclassification allows for the definition of different levels of computability for real numbers based on the chosen function class and the particular representation used.

The paper discusses representations of real numbers that employ functions mapping natural numbers to either natural numbers or rational numbers. By focusing on these functions, any concepts of effectiveness or computation related to them can then be applied to the real numbers that they represent. To achieve this, the paper proposes a method for extending the notions of computability (or subcomputability) from functions on natural numbers to functions that map natural numbers onto rational numbers.

As part of this extension, the paper provides an example using the Beatty function: for a non-rational number x not expressible as m/b^k, the function can be written as B x= f(x)(b, 0), showing that the Beatty function of x is primitive recursive. According to Theorem 6.1, this means that x is a Dedekind primitive recursive real number. And in cases where x is rational, it is trivially considered a Dedekind primitive recursive real number as well.
