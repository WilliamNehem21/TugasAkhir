The structure of this academic paper is outlined as follows. Section 2 reviews the existing research related to text generation and sentiment analysis. Section 3 explains the methodological approach, including details on datasets, preprocessing methods, the structure of the text generation models, and the criteria used for evaluation. Section 4 presents significant findings from the application of various text generation models and sentiment analysis on both the unmodified and adjusted datasets. The paper concludes in Section 5 with a summary and considerations for future research.

The text also refers to an experimental setup where BLEU scores are used to evaluate text generation models. It mentions a divide in the training process, with the initial pre-training of the generator followed by adversarial training to enhance text quality and diversity.

The paper reports on the performance comparison of Sentigan and Catgan models on the CR23K and CR100k datasets using BLEU scores. Sentigan appears to have issues with gradient vanishing on both datasets, leading to a lack of diversity in the text it generates. Consequently, Catgan is selected for synthesizing reviews to create a more balanced dataset.

Finally, the paper hints at possible directions for future research, suggesting the exploration of more sophisticated text generation models like GPT-3 and advanced sentiment analysis techniques to achieve better and more robust modeling capabilities. The improvements observed in the balancing of datasets are indicated with percentages for the CR23K and CR100k datasets.
