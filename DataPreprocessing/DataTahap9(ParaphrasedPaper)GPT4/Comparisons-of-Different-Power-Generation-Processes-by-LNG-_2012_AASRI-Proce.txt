In the study, the authors address the fact that in China, LNG (liquefied natural gas) receiving stations are predominantly situated in the southeastern regions where there is a significant demand for electric power resources. Given this context, the study proposes that harnessing the cold energy from LNG to produce electricity for these stations is a beneficial strategy. To explore this, the paper outlines the design of three distinct LNG cold energy power generation processes.

LNG is characterized by its low temperature, which implies it holds not just chemical energy but also 'cold energy' from its low-temperature state, along with 'pressure energy'. Traditional methods like the Rankine cycle and direct natural gas expansion cycle are not fully efficient in utilizing these forms of energy. By combining the natural gas direct expansion with the Rankine cycle, a more comprehensive energy recovery can be achieved. The paper presents three different combined processes to ascertain which has a higher cold energy utilization rate.

A multi-component mixed refrigerant (MFR) is also featured in the research. MFR typically consists of a combination of methane, ethane, propane, and butane that originates from LNG and LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) resources. The study sets out to control the inlet and outlet temperatures of the MFR process unit, as well as the outlet temperature of the LNG to achieve optimal MFR composition. This is done by ensuring the MFR condenser operates at dew point during feed and bubble point upon discharge, while also considering the temperature differential at the condenser's cold end. According to the design principles outlined, the proposed molar composition for the MFR in the study is 20% ethane, 70% propane, and 10% n-butane.
