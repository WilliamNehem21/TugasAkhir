This paper acknowledges that while numerous methodologies address the same fundamental issues, they are developed with various objectives and perspectives, leading to distinct solutions and preferences. It is crucial to examine how these metamodels relate to each other. Doing so will highlight their similarities and differences and determine whether certain unique traits are either warranted or superfluous. Furthermore, by understanding how these metamodels connect, one can share properties, techniques, and concepts between them, thereby enriching each otherâ€™s methods. A formal analysis of these metamodels may also expose weaknesses in some and suggest potential enhancements.

Concerning mathematical sets, permutations are equivalent to automorphisms because there is no additional structure to maintain, which is why the terminology 'permutation group' is used. Despite this, the term "permutations" is preferred as it has become the standard term within theoretical computer science and is employed in the literature referenced [see 14, section 2.1, and 6, section 3].
