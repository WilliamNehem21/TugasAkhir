Cities around the world are becoming hubs for groundbreaking developments in robotics and automation, technologies that were once confined to the realm of science fiction but are now integral to the fourth industrial revolution. These advancements are transforming all sectors of business and aspects of daily life, enabled by massive increases in computing power, data generation, sophisticated algorithms embedded in digital systems, innovative technologies, and urban connectivity.

State estimation, which involves determining probable values based on observations, is a critical process in many areas of technology, including mobile robotics, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), surveillance systems, smart grids, and healthcare monitoring. Precise state assessment, such as position and orientation, is particularly vital for aerial robot technology to support advanced tasks like route planning and navigation. However, this task becomes more complex in drone swarms, where each drone must ascertain both its own state and the relative states of its peers. Presently, the practical deployment of aerial swarms is limited due to reliance on external systems for state estimation, like motion capture and UWB systems. To address this, we introduce the AGDSVM-GF method for fault detection and enhanced state estimation.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Part II reviews existing literature. Part III describes the AGDSVM-GF architecture. Part IV presents the design and experimental results of the AGDSVM-GF approach, while Part V concludes the study.

The paper explores the application of automated systems in surgery, specifically using the HERNIA-20 dataset for robotic inguinal hernia repairs, and introduces techniques for estimating states during surgery using machine learning models. It also delves into human-state assessment in response to robotic movements via physiological signals, examining emotional reactions in a structured manner.

Furthermore, the paper highlights the use of MEMS-based sensors with gyroscopes, accelerometers, and magnetometers for orientation and motion data collection. It accentuates the importance of preprocessing in making unstructured data machine-friendly for data mining and analysis.

Addressing feature extraction challenges, especially when dealing with large-scale, high-dimensional datasets, is crucial. Methods like LDA and its derivatives help when the number of features exceeds the number of samples. The paper also discusses the use of SVM classifiers to detect faults in robotic systems, emphasizing the computational efficiency and simplicity of these methods.

The paper criticizes traditional fault detection techniques like sliding mode control for their limited real-time application due to issues like chattering and proposes the Variable Gain Super Twisting Sliding Mode (VGTWSM) methodology. Furthermore, it introduces a Fault Detection and Exclusion (FDE) method that uses the Bhattacharya distance for residual analysis and threshold setting, with an expanded information filter for state estimation.

In conclusion, the proposed AGDSVM-GF method and related techniques presented in the paper aim to improve fault detection and state estimation in automated systems, delivering better accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency and energy conservation.
