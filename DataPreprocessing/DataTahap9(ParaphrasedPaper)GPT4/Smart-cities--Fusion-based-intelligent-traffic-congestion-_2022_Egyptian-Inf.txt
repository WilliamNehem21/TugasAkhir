The academic paper discusses the evolution of smart cities with a key focus on mitigating traffic congestion through the development of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs). Recognizing the challenges associated with short communication delays, smooth traffic flow, and road safety, the paper addresses the need for managing the increasing vehicle numbers and traffic accidents.

To tackle the issue, the paper introduces a Fusion-Based Intelligent Traffic Congestion Control System for Vehicular Networks (FITCCS-VN), harnessing Machine Learning (ML) techniques to optimize traffic routing and alleviate congestion. This system aims to collect traffic data and provide real-time, remote access to traffic flow and vehicle volume information to enable drivers to avoid jams. It boasts an accuracy of 95% and a miss rate of 5%, outperforming previous methods.

Furthermore, the paper reviews existing transportation and communication models, including those that involve traffic light timing adjustments, web-based applications for traffic flow visualization, wireless sensor networks for data collection and fusion, and smartphone-based architectures for traffic monitoring. Each of these systems has its limitations, whether in performance, security, or suitability for their intended application.

To create its ML-based system, the paper proposes a model that processes traffic data and predicts congestion using algorithms such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The model requires preprocessing of data, partitioning into training and testing sets, and employing edge computing for data storage.

Overall, this paper promotes a novel approach that integrates ML into traffic control systems within vehicular networks, offering a promising solution to the persistent problem of traffic congestion in rapidly expanding urban environments.
