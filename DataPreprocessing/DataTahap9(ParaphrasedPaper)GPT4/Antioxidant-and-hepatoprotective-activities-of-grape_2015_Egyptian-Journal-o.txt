The study investigated the protective effects of grape seed and skin extract (GSE and GSK) on oxidative stress and liver damage in albino mice induced by an Ehrlich solid tumor (EST). The substances were incorporated into the diets of the mice for 14 days prior to the introduction of tumor cells and continued for 30 days after. Mice with EST exhibited increased liver damage markers (ALT and AST), higher levels of lipid peroxidation (MDA), and lower levels of antioxidants (GSH, SOD, CAT) in blood and liver, alongside histopathological damage and functional deterioration in the liver.

The results showed that supplementation with GSE and GSK led to a reduction in plasma ALT and AST levels, suggesting protection and restoration of liver function. MDA levels decreased, while antioxidant parameters (GSH, SOD, CAT) and liver protein and DNA contents were normalized after supplementation, suggesting an antioxidant mechanism at work. Therefore, GSE and GSK intake was found to protect liver cells in EST-bearing mice by enhancing the body's antioxidant defenses and mitigating oxidative stress caused by the tumor.

Furthermore, the beneficial effects of GSE and GSK are linked to their rich polyphenolic content, which is known to bear antioxidant, anticancer, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory properties, and the ability to activate apoptosis signals. Considering the marked reduction in tumor growth, the antioxidant and free radical scavenging properties of GSE and GSK signify their potential therapeutic value. They also appear to counteract liver damage and the buildup of collagen fibers associated with oxidative stress and liver injury in tumor-bearing mice.
