In this academic paper, the authors discuss the syntactical structure involving an entity 'ai,' and state that the expression 'f(t1, ..., tn)' represents a term constructed from the application of a term-forming operation 'f' to several other terms. They clarify that any subscripts on t, u, and v are merely for differentiation and are not related to hierarchical levels. More details on this will be provided later, but for the moment, a basic understanding is enough.

The paper introduces an approach to hierarchical nominal rewriting, aiming to capture the notions of meta-levels and instantiation within a rewriting framework. Variables are depicted using atoms, and the authors' initial goal is to establish a system where atoms can be replaced with terms, thereby instantiating them.

They have also formulated axiom-schemes that apply universally across various conditions, including all possible i, j, n values, and for every term-forming function 'f.' They acknowledge that these axiom-schemes could be omitted by enhancing the syntax of rewrite rules but do not consider it necessary for the present discussion. The text implies that a fundamental axiom, referred to as (subsub), is always anticipated.

Concerning the concurrency of the rewrite system they propose, the authors concede that proving confluence is complex even when dealing with only two levels. The difficulty arises primarily from the specific non-directional issue (1) which results in increasingly complex syntactical terms. Although issues like this have been addressed (as referenced in section 7 of the paper), they decide that a thorough analysis of these problems is beyond the scope of their current paper.
