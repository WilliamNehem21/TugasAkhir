Example 3.7 demonstrates that the comonads Uz=FzGz, which arise due to the adjunction Fz ‚ä£ Gz, align with the structures of Kz-comonads. This conclusion is derived by referring to the previously established properties of the constituent functors, as well as the co-multiplications, as were elaborated in Example 2.8, specifically in items (2) and (3). The verification that Uz are indeed Kz-comonads is a direct process based on the cited definitions and constructions.
