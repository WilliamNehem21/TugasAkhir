The contemporary world and its economy are heavily reliant on essential systems that facilitate communication, finance, energy distribution, and transport. These systems are increasingly integrated with networked information technologies, which introduces certain weaknesses. Several high-profile incidents have demonstrated the risks associated with exploiting these vulnerabilities. It is challenging to correctly design and implement secure systems that are part of an open network, as most security lapses are due to software bugs. Ensuring the reliability of these security-critical systems against attacks is of paramount importance.

In the context of a cash-loading transaction for a payment card, the process involves the cardholder inserting their card and cash into the designated slots of a loading machine and entering their personal identification number (PIN). The cardholder interacts with the card indirectly, through the load device's display. A Load Secure Application Module (LSAM)—which may be located either within the loading machine or at the load acquirer's server—handles the cryptographic processes and controls. The load acquirer maintains a record of all transactions, and the LSAM communicates with the card issuer using the load host application. The paper proceeds to examine how the load protocol secures communication among the card, LSAM, and the card issuer after cash insertion.

This protocol must be secured to prevent an attacker from initiating it without actually depositing cash. For brevity, the details of how the LSAM and loading device ensure that the cash amount is securely conveyed are omitted. For the protocol participants, there are classes corresponding to the Card, LSAM, and Issuer, with additional classes (CLog, LLog, and ILog) dedicated to logging transactional data.

The paper then discusses the formalization of security properties for model-based testing. One such property involves the assurance of security for the load acquirer. A condition described in the Common Electronic Purse Specifications (CEPS) indicates that when a certain value, mln, along with rln, is sent to the card in a 'creditforload' message, it signifies a commitment from the load acquirer to pay the specified amount to the card's issuer. The security of this transaction is formalized and must be tested.

Unlike traditional specification-based testing that usually focuses on ensuring the system operates correctly under normal conditions (e.g., producing the correct output for given inputs), security testing involves considering abnormal and malicious conditions. This approach involves stressing the system's security mechanisms by assuming that parts of the system could be compromised or behave in a hostile manner.
