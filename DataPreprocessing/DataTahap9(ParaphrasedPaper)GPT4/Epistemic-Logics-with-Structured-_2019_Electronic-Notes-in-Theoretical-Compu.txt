Some research incorporates structured state models into epistemic logic, representing knowledge states with geometric positions and possible knowledge states with transitions between these positions. Furthermore, certain epistemic logics account for varying levels of variable visibility, distinguishing between observable and non-observable information within a knowledge system.

To illustrate, consider an example where a father gives each of his three children—Anna, Bob, and Clara—an envelope containing $0, $1, or $2. Each child receives one envelope and remains unaware of the amount of money the others have received.
