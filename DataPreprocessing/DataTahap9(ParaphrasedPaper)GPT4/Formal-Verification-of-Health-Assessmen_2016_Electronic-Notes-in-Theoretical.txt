This research introduces a systematic approach to verify health assessment tools by applying a formal method based on graph transformations (GT). Utilizing techniques originally designed for software use case verification, the authors adapted the methodology to assess a new standardization guideline for treating cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), a parasitic skin disease.

The paper outlines the necessity of refining health assessment processes, which currently rely on ad-hoc and manual verification, reducing their effectiveness. It describes how the GT-based procedure can efficiently identify issues in medical guidelines, potentially improving their applicability and reliability.

The paper is organized into four main sections, beginning with a case study on CL, followed by an overview of the GT-based verification method. Further details on the methodology and its application to the CL treatment guideline are provided, detailing the problems encountered and the evolution of the tool throughout the verification process. Results and discussions conclude the study.

The authors demonstrate the potential benefits of formal verification in healthcare, revealing how GT can unearth and correct ambiguities and inconsistencies in medical guidelines, which could otherwise compromise their utility. The promising results suggest that such verification can offer a cost-effective means to validate and enhance health interventions, with possible applications beyond the medical field into other disciplines.
