A summary of the academic paper discussions and proposals on load balancing for cloud computing:

K.I. Arif introduced the Effective Load Balancing Algorithm with Deadline Constraint (ELBAD), which focuses on distributing the nearest deadline tasks to the highest speed virtual machines (VMs) before balancing the workload among them. ELBAD operates by organizing tasks based on their deadlines and VMs by their speeds, facilitating task distribution in line with task deadlines and VM capacity. For managing load, VMs are labeled as underloaded, loaded, or overloaded, with the latter shifting some tasks to underloaded VMs. The algorithm, demonstrating its efficiency by outdoing standard algorithms such as FCFS, SJF, Min-Min, and EDF, seeks to reduce the overall completion time (makespan) and enhance resource utilization.

A Distributed Dynamic Load Balancing Method based on a Hybrid approach (EDLBHA) detects underutilized machines swiftly to utilize resources more effectively. The cloud is partitioned dynamically, with partitions being categorized as idle, normal, or overloaded based on load, queue length, and processing time. New tasks are allocated to suitable partitions, possibly considering priority. The EDLBHA's performance, tested using cloud simulation tools, surpasses other load balancing algorithms in metrics like energy consumption and times for waiting, response, and turnaround.

S. Jeyalaksshmi et al. proposed enhancements to the Round Robin and Honey Bee algorithms to improve load balancing. VMs are categorized as overburdened or underburdened, with tasks being shifted from the former and prioritized. By incorporating VM weights based on computing power and the honeybee behavior algorithm for priority tasks, this approach aims to optimize load distribution. The experiments showed that these modifications offer quicker response and data center load times.

K.R. Remesh et al. modified the Bee Colony algorithm for cloud load balancing, moving low-priority tasks from overloaded to underloaded VMs and using honey bee foraging behavior as a model. They aimed to minimize the makespan and number of migrations, achieving better Quality of Service (QoS). The performance outstripped the existing Bee Colony algorithm through experimentation.

A. Pradhan et al. utilized the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to address load balancing and task scheduling through the Load Balancing Modified PSO (LBMPSO) protocol. They employed a fitness function to assess the optimal arrangement of particles (tasks), focusing on execution time. LBMPSO, executed via the CloudSim simulator, was shown to outperform other PSO-based techniques in makespan and resource utilization.

A. Rath et al. employed Self-Adaptive Salp Swarm Optimization for cloud load balancing, integrating a sigmoid function for task assignment compatibility. They formulated a comprehensive task fitness function aiming at both minimizing metrics like makespan and response time, and maximizing VM utilization. When compared to recent metaheuristic approaches, the proposed algorithm excelled in all measured performance metrics.

The paper also provides insights into the overall problem of distributing independent tasks of various lengths to VMs based on compute capabilities to achieve fair distribution and efficient network performance. It suggests that tasks can be queued on VMs when their number exceeds the available machines, but some VMs might remain idle if tasks are fewer.

The Hungarian Method, known for solving the assignment problem in polynomial time, is employed for optimal resource matching to minimize cost or maximize profit.

Finally, the proposed Load Balancing Technique LBCChung is evaluated through simulation alongside Min-Min and First Come First Serve (FCFS) methods, considering performance metrics to ensure lower makespan and higher throughput compared to the other techniques.
