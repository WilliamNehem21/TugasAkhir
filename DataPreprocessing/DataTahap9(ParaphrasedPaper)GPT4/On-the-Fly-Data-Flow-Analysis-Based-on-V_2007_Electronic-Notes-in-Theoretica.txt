In the past twenty years, significant advancements have been made in the development of techniques and tools for testing and verifying the reliability of complex software systems. There has been substantial progress in formal methods yielding potent languages, algorithms, methodologies, and tools that have been applied effectively to software models. Currently, we can consider using these methods on actual software programs by seamlessly incorporating verification processes into compilers.

Two key techniques have contributed to this progress: static program analysis and model checking. Static program analysis examines a program without executing it to deduce accurate information about its runtime behavior, which helps eliminate certain errors and optimize program compilation. On the other hand, model checking involves comprehensively exploring the possible states of a program—particularly concurrent ones—to verify if it behaves as desired.

The paper highlights the efficacy of using model checking to implement static analysis in a way that can be integrated with compilers. It discusses a specific type of static analysis called live variable (LV) analysis, which determines whether a variable (like x or y) is "live" at different points in a program—meaning the variable's value will be used later. For example, if a variable's value is updated before its next read, it is not live at the points before the update.

The paper also presents an approach to encode deterministic finite automata (DFA) for static analysis using Boolean Equation Systems (BES), which are efficiently executed within the CADP toolbox, a well-known verification suite. Experiments confirm the approach's efficiency with realistic examples. Moreover, it describes an optimized storage method for the program counter to minimize unnecessary information during the static analysis of program control flow graphs (CFG).

Results of experiments with classical C program examples and influence analysis illustrate the practical use of different DFA techniques in simplifying program compilation, as well as the effectiveness of influence analysis in the context of program optimization.

The authors also detail how their tool applies to third-party specification languages, using the example of the Dekker mutual exclusion protocol specified in LOTOS. By converting the LOTOS description to a CFG and analyzing it, the study finds that not all variables need to be considered "live" at every state, allowing for more efficient verification.

In conclusion, the paper suggests a promising approach to static analysis integrated with compilers and tools like CADP, which could improve future software reliability. Future work will focus on other static analysis problems such as reset variable analysis and connecting compilers to the abstract CFG model in the most natural and efficient manner.
