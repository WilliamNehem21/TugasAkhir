This paper discusses the influence of pattern classifiers and feature extraction methods on the performance of optical character recognition (OCR) systems for English handwritten characters. The authors focus on features derived from a binarization process and investigate the use of a multi-layer feedforward artificial neural network for classification. Preprocessing steps like thinning, noise reduction, cropping, and size normalization are implemented prior to classifying the character images. The combined approach of binarization-based feature extraction and neural network classification yields high recognition accuracy for offline cursive handwritten text.

The field of offline cursive handwriting recognition, which involves digitizing handwritten text from static surfaces, has long presented challenges for researchers over the past four decades. Although substantial progress has been made in recognizing machine-printed characters, advancements in handwriting recognition have been relatively limited. The paper references previous works, including Kundu and Chen's 2002 study that achieved 88.2% accuracy recognizing postal words with Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Tomoyuki et al.'s 2007 research obtaining 80.2% accuracy on European city names.

Binarization, an essential image processing step, seeks to simplify images by separating pixels into two groups—white for the background and black for the foreground—thereby reducing background noise while preserving important image details.

The study reports an impressive 85.62% classification accuracy using binarization features and a neural network classifier with a back-propagation algorithm. The authors identify the quality of the training samples, feature extraction method, and classifier as key components impacting recognition accuracy. Future research could explore combining binarization features with different types of features, such as projection profile features, and evaluate various classifiers like Radial Basis Function (RBF) networks, HMMs, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and others to potentially improve results.
