Spatial data algorithms (SDAs) are specialized algorithms designed for handling and processing geographic location data, which are a fundamental aspect of geoinformatics. This interdisciplinary field combines information technology with cartography and geoscience disciplines. Students in geoinformatics frequently engage with visual representations such as maps, making software visualization a suitable method for teaching SDAs.

Even though the visualization of SDAs is critical within geoinformatics, it has not been an extensively researched topic recently. The MAVis algorithm visualization tool has been documented to showcase a particular spatial algorithm, but other novel developments in the field are rare.

Existing systems provide users with two primary interactive features: viewing algorithm animations with variable input and creating new animations for self-implemented algorithms. These interaction methods align with the "viewing," "changing," and "constructing" stages of the engagement taxonomy.

Tracing exercises invite students to follow along with algorithmic operations and witness changes in data structures. Visual algorithm simulation tools like TRAKLA2 support this learning method by offering visual aids, thus eliminating repetitive drawing tasks. TRAKLA2 also includes automatic assessment features for student responses.

Spatial data algorithms operate on geometric forms such as points, lines, and polygons. Multidimensional spatial data can be stored as key values based on geometric attributes. For instance, a polygon might be represented by an ordered list of its vertex coordinates.

Creating spatial data for use in SDA exercises poses a challenge. For effective visualization and learning, data sets must be uncluttered, with distinct geometric entities and minimal label overlap. Due to the specific constraints of each exercise, there's a need for specialized mechanisms to generate appropriate data.

In open tracing exercises, students are prompted to explore an algorithm's workings more freely to meet set goals, such as constructing a Delaunay triangulation. Given tools like edge addition and in-circle tests, students can actively experiment with modifying structures to understand broader concepts.

An analysis of TRAKLA2's impact showed a noticeable change between 2007 and 2008, which was attributable to modifications in exercises rather than overall change in student performance. An easier set of exercises was introduced in 2008, affecting results.

Interviews with students using TRAKLA2's spatial exercises revealed their positive experiences. Despite rating lectures as the primary learning source, they acknowledged TRAKLA2's role in enhancing their understanding of algorithms. Prior knowledge of the algorithms, however, was considered necessary by students before attempting these exercises.

The relation between TRAKLA2 exercise performance and final exam results in the Spatial Data Algorithms course was strong and significant, but given the small sample size, the figures could be skewed by individual results.

Overall, the interviews suggested a positive reception of the system, with a general call for more exercises covering additional algorithms. Interactive visual exercises were believed to lead to more engaged learning and longer-lasting retention compared to traditional reading.

In essence, the interviews and outcomes point towards the value of employing visual algorithm simulations like TRAKLA2 in supporting traditional teaching methods, reinforcing the importance of such tools in the educational process.
