Linear and cross-linked copolymers were created using 2-hydroxyethylacrylate and 2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate, and their physical and chemical characteristics were examined. These copolymer solutions and hydrogels behave differently at specific temperatures, with solutions showing a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) and hydrogels exhibiting a substantial shrinkage when heated. The copolymers' interaction with different surfactants was also studied, demonstrating that their swelling behavior in aqueous surfactant solutions is influenced by factors like the copolymer composition and surfactant concentration, and how surfactants affect the hydrogels.

Enhancing the phase transition conditions of these temperature-sensitive polymers can be achieved through complexation with ionic surfactants via hydrophobic interactions, introducing ionic groups that increase solubility in water—especially at higher surfactant concentrations. The hydrophobic characteristics of the polymer and surfactant and their structures are decisive in the interaction effectiveness between non-ionic polymer and ionic surfactant.

The LCST was determined using a turbidity method with a UV-VIS spectrophotometer, and the swelling ratio was identified by comparing gel volumes under different conditions. Temperature-dependent behaviors of the hydrogels were investigated with careful temperature control and settling time for the gels at each temperature point.

By using poly(ethylene glycol) dimethacrylate (PEGDMA) as a cross-linker and changing the copolymerization medium to a half-and-half mix of ethanol and water, the swelling degree of HEA-HEMA hydrogels was improved. Despite only a small structural difference between HEA and HEMA—the presence of an extra methyl group—this resulted in an LCST for their copolymers.

For a hydrogel to have a significant thermal response, it must swell well in water and contain enough hydrophobic groups to engage in strong hydrophobic interactions. Utilizing the interaction of hydrophobic non-ionic polymers with ionic surfactants enhanced the water solubility of the copolymers due to electrostatic repulsion between equally charged surfactant heads along the polymer chain. Cetylpyridinium bromide (CPB) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) were used as model ionic surfactants.

Ionic network charges and counterions in the hydrogel network cause extra osmotic pressure, leading to an expanded conformation and increased swelling. At low surfactant concentrations, however, the surfactant can result in additional network junctions and contraction due to micelle formation within the hydrogel.

The research involved preparing HEA-HEMA copolymers through free radical copolymerization and studying their physicochemical properties with techniques like NMR spectroscopy and gel permeation. The interaction with surfactants revealed that copolymers' temperature-sensitive swelling properties markedly improved after interacting with CPB and SDS, showing a distinct and pronounced temperature-induced collapse when exposed to surfactant solutions.
