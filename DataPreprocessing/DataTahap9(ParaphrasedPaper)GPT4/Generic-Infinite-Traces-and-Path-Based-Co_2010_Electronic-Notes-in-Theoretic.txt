Path-based temporal logics, such as CTL*, CTL, LTL, and PCTL, are widely used for specifying behaviors in systems automation and verification, particularly for traditional and probabilistic transition systems. However, there is no overarching theoretical framework that unifies these logics.

To better understand these logics, it is necessary to define computation paths. This involves two key concepts: transition types (which define the properties of transitions, typically being linear) and computational types (which explain the organization of transitions from states, for example using sets or probability distributions). A specific mathematical property, distributivity of "T" over "F", allows the computation paths to share the same structure as their originating states.

A significant finding is that any commutative monad (a specific algebraic structure) on the category Set can form a standard distributive law with any "shapely" polynomial functor (a type of mapping that's constructed in a specific way). This provides insight into how different mathematical structures, such as the powerset monad, relate to one another. It's noted that these findings can generalize to categories beyond Set that support certain algebraic operations.

The coalgebraic path-based temporal logics proposed in this paper build on an extended notion of predicate lifting, which differs from traditional coalgebraic modal logics. Predicate lifting, originally introduced by Pattinson, is adapted here for more complex categories including Set and Meas.

For the non-empty powerset monad, it is shown that the infinite trace map behaves as an op-lax coalgebra morphism, which is a weaker relationship than a traditional coalgebra morphism. It is suggested that the map's continuity might be a necessary condition to define a proper coalgebra morphism for any monad; however, further investigation is needed to confirm this.

Finally, the paper discusses extending these results to more general (non-affine) monads, like the multiset monad, which is important for graded temporal logic. Additionally, the paper indicates interest in exploring the connection between finite and potentially infinite traces as another future research avenue.
