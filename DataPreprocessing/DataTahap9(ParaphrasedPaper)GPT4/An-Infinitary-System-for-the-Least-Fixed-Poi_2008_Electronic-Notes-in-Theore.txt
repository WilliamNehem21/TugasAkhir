The concept of the least fixed-point operator is commonly used in computer science, such as in relational database query languages. To address the limitations of first-order classical logic (FOL) in expressiveness, logics like least fixed-point logic (LFP) have been introduced with fixed-point operators. LFP is especially notable as it correlates with the PTIME complexity class over finite ordered structures. The descriptive characterization of computational classes is an important topic in finite model theory (FMT) along with the proof of normalization theorems for subsystems of logic.

A landmark result by Trakhtenbrot in 1950, foundational to FMT, demonstrated that validity in finite models cannot be recursively enumerated, indicating a failure of completeness in such models. This result assumes that all formal proofs within deductive systems are finite and recursive. However, in proof theory for arithmetic, such assumptions are often relaxed.

This paper proposes an infinitary natural deduction system for FOL and LFP when restricted to finite models (FOL_FIN and LFP_FIN, respectively). The authors claim to prove the soundness and completeness of these systems, as well as a normalization theorem for parts of these systems. The proposed deductive system for LFP_FIN offers a proof theory that provides an alternative way to obtain results formerly achieved within FMT and to discover novel results from a proof-theoretical standpoint. Under certain constraints, this system can also assist theorem proving for relational database queries.

The paper outlines a natural deduction system for FOL_FIN in its second section, expanding FOL with rules to accommodate finite models. In the third section, LFP and its semantics are defined, followed by the introduction of rules for handling the least fixed-point operator in the fourth section. Section five describes a normalization procedure—a method to rewrite derivations to a normal form by eliminating redundancies—for FOL_FIN and LFP_FIN. The authors conclude by affirming that they introduced an infinitary natural deduction system for LFP_FIN, showcased its extension from a system for FOL_FIN, and validated the soundness, completeness, and normalization for parts of these systems.
