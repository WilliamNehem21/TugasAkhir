The academic paper discusses the challenges in model checking of embedded software, especially programs for microcontrollers written in C that involve direct hardware accesses or embedded assembly instructions. Traditional model checking tools like SMV, SPIN, and UPPAAL require models to be described in their own languages, which entails a significant effort to translate existing systems into these formalisms. For higher level programming languages, C code model checkers do not effectively handle features specific to microcontroller programs.

To overcome these challenges, the paper introduces [MC]square, a model checker designed to verify assembly code directly, thus eliminating the potential introduction of compiler errors and taking advantage of the well-defined semantics of assembly language. Despite the advantage of checking assembly code, this approach can lead to larger state spaces and hardware dependency.

[MC]square supports various features, such as direct and indirect memory access, recursion, and functions for specific microcontrollers (e.g., Atmel ATmega and Infineon XC167). Its architecture is extensible, and it employs several abstraction techniques to manage the potential state explosion problem, including an approach called interrupt nondeterminism, which abstracts the state of interrupt bits to simplify the state space.

To demonstrate its effectiveness, [MC]square was applied to the Atmel ATmega16 microcontroller. By making interrupt bits below the current level nondeterministic, the model checker can significantly reduce the state space, up to a factor of 2^n for n interrupt levels.

The paper includes a case study illustrating how delayed nondeterminism for interrupts (DND) can control the state space size. The researchers confirm that DND preserves a simulation relation, which is crucial since this abstraction cannot be disabled in [MC]square. The abstraction is necessary, as without it, programs with multiple interrupts would be unmanageable.

Future research directions involve investigating whether a bisimulation relation can be established with DND for values, potentially by instantiating nondeterminism in a way that preserves bisimulation. Other goals include implementing a model checking algorithm for three-valued logic and developing domain-specific abstraction techniques.

In summary, [MC]square is an innovative tool that addresses the complexities of model checking for embedded microcontroller software and shows promise in managing the state space explosion problem through advanced abstraction methods. It offers the capability to check larger programs and could potentially be extended to many other microcontrollers.
