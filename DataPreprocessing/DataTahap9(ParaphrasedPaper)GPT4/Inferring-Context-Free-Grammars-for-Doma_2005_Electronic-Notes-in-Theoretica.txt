The original paper discusses the use of machine learning in the derivation of grammars, an application with a variety of uses including software engineering, syntactic pattern recognition, computational biology, computational linguistics, speech recognition, and language acquisition. In software engineering, recovering grammar from outdated systems is critical for automating the creation of software analysis and modification tools. While in some cases, grammars can be derived from existing compilers and manuals, in other domains these resources are not available and grammars must be learned directly from structured data or recursively generated artifacts.

The paper also connects to the field of software system renovation, where the availability of a grammar aids in the speedy development of renovation tools. However, several existing methods for grammar inference fail to decipher the grammars of general-purpose programming languages such as COBOL. This paper offers a methodology that allows for the inference of grammars for smaller, specialized languages.

The paper is structured to include a brief review of significant findings in grammar inference research. It then introduces MARSâ€”a semi-automatic inference system for domain-specific modeling (DSM), which is part of model-driven software engineering. DSM allows domain experts to specify high-level solutions to domain-specific problems. MARS aims to tackle "metamodel drift", where instance models become misaligned with their defining metamodels. The system restores metamodels to accurately define archived instance models, leveraging existing tools and new grammar inference algorithms.

The paper presents a strategy where the search space is focused on grammars that accept positive examples, with negative examples used later to avoid overgeneralization. A fitness value scale from 0 to 1 measures how well grammars recognize these positive and, subsequently, negative samples.

It acknowledges that past efforts to learn context-free grammars were largely unsuccessful with practical examples. In this new approach, grammar-specific heuristic operators and initial population construction strategies that use information from positive examples have been introduced to improve results.

Future work suggested by the authors includes the application of data mining techniques to grammar inference, combining heuristic approaches with traditional brute-force methods, and investigating the potential for using support vector machines (SVMs) for inferring context-free grammars.
