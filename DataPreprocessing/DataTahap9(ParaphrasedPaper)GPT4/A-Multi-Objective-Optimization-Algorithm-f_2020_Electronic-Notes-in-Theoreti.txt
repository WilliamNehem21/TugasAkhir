Clustering is widely regarded as a key unsupervised learning challenge, involving the search for patterns in data without predefined labels. The objective of clustering algorithms is to group similar items into clusters, a task that is fundamental across various fields including data compression, image processing, bioinformatics, and data mining.

The unstructured nature of clustering leads to a multitude of definitions and methods for creating clusters. The "center-based" model is a popular approach among the different clustering models. Modifying traditional algorithms, such as k-means, to handle outliers remains a prominent concern.

The paper introduces a robust, partitioning clustering algorithm titled SSO-C, which aims to create strict partitions and is less sensitive to outliers. Solving optimization problems in clustering often necessitates sophisticated algorithms, a notable example being the Social Spider Optimization (SSO) algorithm, inspired by collective spider behavior and based on swarm intelligence principles.

In the SSO algorithm, potential solutions within the search space are symbolized by the positions of virtual spiders on a web, with higher quality solutions having greater weights. Spiders communicate via vibrations on this web, directing each other towards more promising regions of the search space and ultimately converging on optimal solutions using female, male, and mating operators.

The paper also discusses a variation of the k-means algorithm known as k-medians. Here, the objective function differs, as it relies on the sum of non-squared Euclidean distances within clusters, making it more robust to outliers.

The paper addresses the EMAX problem, which lacks a formal definition in the literature but has been indirectly tackled in prior clustering approaches. Using the SSO algorithm, an approximation for the EMAX problem, termed SSO-A, is explored.

A mathematical challenge highlighted in the paper is the difficulty of constructing a geometric median for multiple points, as evidenced by the lack of a solution expressible by radicals for even five points. Nonetheless, polynomial-time approximation algorithms have been developed for large datasets.

When an algorithm's clusters cease changing, convergence is reached, similar to what is observed with k-means. This paper concludes with the presentation of two algorithms: EMAX, which builds upon the heuristic used in k-means, and SSO-C, based on the Social Spider Optimization algorithm, aimed at solving multi-objective problems by minimizing a weighted sum of two objective functions.

Future work involves performing experiments with more complex datasets and enhancing initialization procedures to improve SSO-C's convergence and robustness. Additionally, for the EMAX problem, establishing proof of convergence and investigating its computational complexity are intended.
