Adjusting the aircraft's altitude is achieved by selecting a new altitude on the altitude display at the upper center of the Guidance Control Panel (GCP) and modifying it via the ALT dial. Upon reaching the chosen altitude, the aircraft automatically stabilizes at that altitude.

Although these actions may appear straightforward, complexities arise if the ALT dial or Vertical Speed (VS) thumbwheel is manipulated while an altitude mode is already engaged. If the ALT dial is adjusted during the change level mode, the new altitude becomes the target. Conversely, altering the VS thumbwheel causes the aircraft to switch to vertical speed mode.

Several examples illustrate the operational nuances of this system. Consider an initial scenario where the pilot engages vertical speed mode to climb at 2,000 feet per minute (FPM) up to an altitude limit of 27,000 feet. As the aircraft approaches this limit, at 25,000 feet, the autopilot will automatically switch to capture mode. However, if the pilot modifies the ALT dial at 26,000 feet, the aircraft's behavior will depend on the new altitude setting.

There is an issue, though, since there is essential data regarding the altitude at which capture mode began (the cap start altitude) that is not displayed to the pilot. Therefore, it is not feasible for pilots to form an accurate mental model that reflects the actual operation of the autopilot, as their model would be based on incomplete information.

One proposed solution warns the pilot through an indicator light by the altitude window if a capture is imminent, meaning that the set limit is active. Another more drastic proposal suggests that altering the ALT dial while in capture mode should revert the system to change level mode rather than engaging vertical speed mode, which would foster a simpler and more precise mental model for pilots.
