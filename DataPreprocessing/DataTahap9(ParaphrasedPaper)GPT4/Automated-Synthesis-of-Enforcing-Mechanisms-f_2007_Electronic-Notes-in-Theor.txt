In references [21,22], an approach for reinforcing security through the automatic creation of controllers that detect and block unauthorized actions by external agents was introduced. In the current study, this method is expanded to incorporate timed settings, and under some conditions, it can also enforce information flow properties. The paper explores this extension, specifically in the context of dynamic systems that can vary in size based on parameters.

In recent years, much focus has been placed on not just analyzing but also enforcing security properties. Building on the concept of security automata and subsequent refinements, this paper seeks to design controller operators that can enforce various security properties, including those related to information flow, in a time-sensitive environment. The method primarily uses an advanced form of partial model checking, and the paper demonstrates how it can be applied to systems with multiple adjustable parameters.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 reviews the theory behind the analysis of security properties in timed systems. Section 3 introduces the authors' approach, addressing the combination of security properties and dealing with parameterized systems. A practical example is provided in Section 4. Section 5 discusses related work in the field. Finally, Section 6 concludes the discussion.

Information flow, particularly in the context of how different user levels interact with a system without unauthorized data leakage, is a key aspect of security. For example, preventing low-level users from inferring high-level user activities through the system behavior can be captured using concepts like non-deducibility on composition (NDC). The paper builds on this, suggesting ways to ensure information flow properties such as tbNDC using controllers.

Parameterized systems are discussed, as they represent an infinite set of potential finite-state systems when varying parameters are applied. The authors illustrate how a controller can be defined that ensures that when any component is combined with the system, the security specifications are still met.

Prior research focused on the enforceability of security properties. The authors highlight an advantage of their approach, which is its ability to only monitor the untrusted or necessary part of a system rather than the whole, making it particularly useful when not all system components can or should be checked.

Controller synthesis is not unique to computer security and is also studied in other domains, such as real-time systems. The paper refers to works where controller synthesis is used to meet real-time specifications, comparing these strategies with the authors' approach.

Lastly, the paper introduces a technique for enforcing information flow properties through process algebra controller operators, identifying sufficient conditions for enforcing properties like tbNDC. The authors acknowledge the limitations of their current method and express their intent to further refine the approach to better address these challenges.
