The research paper presents a strategy to enhance service quality in two-tiered cellular networks. This model targets decreasing the likelihood of new call blockage and the premature end of ongoing calls by assigning slow or stationary users to microcells and high-speed users to macrocells. The study focuses on CDMA systems, which support soft handoffs, enabling further quality improvements through a novel channel borrowing scheme paired with a FIFO queue within the macrocell layer. The system is modeled using a multidimensional Markov chain, and an iterative method helps determine the steady-state probability distribution. Analysis of this distribution reveals the system's probabilities for new call blockage and unwanted call termination.

Handoff is the key process of transferring active calls between cells as users move across a network. The study categorizes usersâ€™ calls based on their speed, affecting their handoff behavior and the resulting system performance. Handoffs in a two-tier cellular network can be between microcells, between macrocells, or from a microcell to a macrocell.

The paper introduces a mobility-based handoff scheme, allowing calls without free channels to borrow a channel from another call within the same cell. This happens through a handoff queue system if no immediate channels are available. This channel borrowing particularly improves the experience for high-speed calls, as they make more frequent handoffs and thus gain more from this approach.

The study's findings show that the channel borrowing scheme significantly improves the system's performance, particularly for high-speed calls, by providing a reduction in both call blockage and forced termination probabilities. An average reduction in call blockage for low-speed calls is 12%, and for high-speed calls, it's 9%. In terms of forced termination probabiilty, an average reduction of 0.1% is observed for low-speed calls, whereas high-speed calls see a more substantial decrease of 26%. The paper concludes that this tailored approach effectively improves quality of service for users with varying speeds, without compromising overall network throughput.
