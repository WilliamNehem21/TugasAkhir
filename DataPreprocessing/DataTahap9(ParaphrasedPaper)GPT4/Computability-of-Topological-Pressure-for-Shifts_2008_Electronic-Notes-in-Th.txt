This paper delves into the computational aspects of topological pressure, an extension of the concept of topological entropy. It builds on previous work on the computability of topological entropy and shows that, while topological entropy can be computed for various shift dynamical systems beyond shifts of finite type, the computability of topological pressure is confirmed only for shifts of finite type. The relevance of this research extends to one-dimensional spin systems, which are of interest in theoretical statistical physics, as the computability insights from topological pressure can be applied to these models. The paper emphasizes the significance of computability theory within the physics community, where these systems are often studied using Monte Carlo simulations.

The paper also addresses limitations inherent in the computability of the topological pressure. When no constraints are set on the type of shift space, there exist scenarios where it is impossible for a type-2 machine to compute the value of the topological pressure. This impossibility is determined by using names (encodings) for the shift space and the continuous function as inputs. The paper cites earlier research that demonstrates a similar computational limitation for topological entropy, which at its essence is the topological pressure for a zero function, implying that these computational constraints also extend to topological pressure.
