The paper discusses the development of a Customized Instrumented Foot Transducer (IFT) system designed to measure the dynamic forces exerted by lower limbs during agricultural machinery operations. Traditional force transducers used in sports and medical research provided the blueprint for the creation of these new transducers. Accuracy levels as high as 97-99% were achieved by previous devices, which involved strain gauges, piezoresistive dynamometers, and Hall-effect sensors. However, these systems typically require complex data logging setups and are used in controlled laboratory conditions.

The newly developed IFT features a force transducer with Hall-effect sensors to capture the forces applied by the feet during agricultural tasks like treadling and operating pedals and tractors. Force measurements are recorded together with the position information provided by magnetic cells passed by the sensor. This data is stored on a memory card, displayed on an LCD screen, and can be transferred to a computer.

Initial tests with different external loads on a treadle platform showed that force exerted was highest at the top position and lowest at the bottom. The results also detailed specific peak forces during pedaling actions.

The system is unique due to its ease of use and minimal data recording complexity, making it suitable for in-field assessment without reliance on a laboratory environment. The IFT system can help evaluate and improve machinery design to reduce the risk of musculoskeletal disorders by allowing the assessment of forces at various positions and postures.

Agricultural machinery manufacturers can utilize the system to inform design updates and enhance safety features, while ergonomists might develop protocols to ensure efficient work-rest schedules during operations. It holds particular promise for developing countries, where small-scale farming is prevalent, and improving the design of agricultural machinery can have a significant impact on reducing labor-induced musculoskeletal discomforts.
