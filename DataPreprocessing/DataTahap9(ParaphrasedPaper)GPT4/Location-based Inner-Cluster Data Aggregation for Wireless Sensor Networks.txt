The paper discusses the importance of conserving energy in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) by minimizing unnecessary data transmissions to the base station (BS). Since all neighboring nodes in a WSN receive messages from a transmitting node due to the network's broadcast nature, the most effective strategy for saving energy is to reduce these superfluous broadcasts. Data aggregation is a technique that enhances WSN longevity by eliminating these redundant transmissions.

There is a wealth of research on various data aggregation methods for WSNs. Al-Karaki et al. presented algorithms for exact and approximate data aggregation, while Aonishi et al. analyzed how aggregation efficiency affects GIT routing. Gatani et al. introduced a robust data gathering method, and Considine et al. proposed approximate aggregation for sensor databases. Villas et al. developed a scalable and dynamic routing protocol with data aggregation, Heinzelman et al. introduced LEACH for network clustering and electing cluster heads, and Younis et al. suggested HEED, which considers residual energy for cluster head selection.

Typically, cluster-based data aggregation involves two stages: aggregation within the cluster and then transferring the fused data to the base station. These cluster-based schemes often focus on the second stage, with all sensors forwarding their data to the cluster aggregator in the first stage. Our proposed method, LBDA (Location-Based Inner-Cluster Data Aggregation), capitalizes on WSN characteristics, namely that sensors within the same vicinity likely report similar readings, to cut down on transmissions within the cluster.

In our LBDA approach, we partition each cluster into four regions, with nodes determining their respective regions using location information. For each region, the cluster head acknowledges the quantity of nodes contained and appoints certain nodes as agents, ensuring their communication range encompasses their designated region. Data transmission to the cluster head is only required from nodes within the same region that have dissimilar readings compared to the agent node, thus reducing the number of transmissions within the cluster.
