Here's a paraphrased version of the provided text:

The paper in reference [28, corollary 4] introduces an alternative proof to a pre-existing lower bound in the field of algebraic complexity concerning polynomial equations. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the real incompressibility method, which serves as the converse approach to the established fact 1.1d). We intend to present yet another example through observation 4.1.

In detail, Remark 2.2 indicates that any limited piece of information (such as the number of real constants or the length of an input needed to simulate a machine) can be integrated into the existing coding strategy without necessitating a larger encoding format. This adaptation helps to circumvent several potential issues associated with traditional Kolmogorov complexity, as demonstrated in [20, example 2.1.4].

Although responses to certain questions may initially be incorrect, it is known that there exists a value beyond which all queries from the finite set u1, ..., un are answered accurately. This also applies to any 'negative' queries vj. Consequently, for any m sufficiently large, the function g(x, m) will produce the same output as f(x).
