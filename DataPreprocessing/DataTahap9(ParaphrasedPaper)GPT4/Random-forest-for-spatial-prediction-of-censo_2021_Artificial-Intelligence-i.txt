In many areas of geosciences, data measurements can sometimes fall below or above detection limits of instruments, leading to censored data where the exact values are not known, only that they fall into certain ranges. Censoring can be left-sided (below detectable limits), right-sided (above detectable limits), or interval-based (within a range). This censoring presents a challenge for data analysis and modeling.

The paper discusses a machine learning method designed to address the issues created by censored data in spatial prediction tasks. Instead of resorting to ad hoc methods that typically involve deleting, substituting, or imputing censored observations, the proposed method fully integrates both censored and uncensored observations in the analysis. Using a combination of randomized quadratic programming to adjust principal component coefficients and regression tree predictors, the method constructs an ensemble of predictors to achieve spatial prediction that aligns with actual observed data, both censored and uncensored.

The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated through simulation and real-world examples. Accuracy is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Lin's Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC), where lower MAE and RMSE indicate better accuracy, and a CCC closer to 1 signifies a more accurate prediction.

In the simulation example, turning bands method in the R package `rgeostats` is used. The ground truth is available throughout the study area, which showcases a non-linear relationship between the response and predictor variables, including some variable interactions and spatial auto-correlation, with a non-Gaussian distribution.

The real-world application focuses on geochemical concentration of scandium (Sc) in southwest England. With 568 sampling locations and approximately 6% censored observations due to a lower detection limit, the study uses a training set of about 75% of the data and a testing set of about 25%. The testing set is particularly used to evaluate the added value of censored observations.

In the results, the proposed machine learning method outperforms ad hoc methods in terms of incorporating censored data without the need for substitution or imputation. It effectively uses all observations in model building. When new observations come in, only randomized quadratic programming needs to be rerun, making it a practical and efficient solution for incorporating censored data. The implementation is straightforward, combining established machine learning techniques with Monte Carlo sampling and optimization.
