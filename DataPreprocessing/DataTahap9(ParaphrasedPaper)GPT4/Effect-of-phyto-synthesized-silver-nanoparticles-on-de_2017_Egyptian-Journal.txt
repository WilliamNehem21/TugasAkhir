The study examines the efficacy of using silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) biologically synthesized from the leaf filtrate of the plant *A. nilagirica* as eco-friendly larvicides against mosquito larvae. Existing approaches like *Knema attenuata*, *Acalypha alnifolia*, and the microbial insecticide *Metarhizium anisopliae*, as well as marine-derived nereistoxin, have proved less effective and potentially harmful ecologically. The silver nanoparticles offer a promising alternative due to their rapid and environmentally sensitive synthesis.

The mosquitoes for the study were reared based on the techniques outlined by Sundaravadivelan et al. Mosquito samples were obtained from the National Centre for Disease Control in Mettupalayam, Coimbatore, and raised in trays with distilled water.

Leaves of *A. nilagirica* were collected, cleaned, and processed into an aqueous extract, which was then utilized to produce various concentrations of AgNPs. Within 24 hours of exposure, these nanoparticles caused significant mortality of mosquito pupae at a concentration of 0.25%, whereas no mortality was noted in the control group.

The rapid color change observed in the reaction mixture indicated the successful production of AgNPs, and scanning electron microscopy confirmed the relatively spherical to irregular shape of these particles. The findings suggest that *A. nilagirica*-based AgNPs might be a novel natural product-based intervention for mosquito control, presenting a potential approach to managing vector populations with minimal ecological impact.
