As computer science continues to evolve, there is an increasing focus on studying its mathematical underpinnings, which is a shared area of interest among mathematicians and computer scientists. Three key interdisciplinary fields—Domain Theory (DT), Formal Concept Analysis (FCA), and Rough Set Theory (RST)—are recognized for their foundational role in both computer and information sciences. These fields are interconnected through their reliance on relational (order-based) concepts while simultaneously contributing to disciplines such as topology, algebra, and logic.

Domain Theory was created by Scott to understand the semantics of programming languages, basing its principles on the notions of partial information and stepwise refinement. It examines partially ordered sets (posets), approximate orders, and computational models to establish a mathematical basis for programming language design and implementation.

Formal Concept Analysis, introduced by Wille and others in 1982, employs an order-theoretic approach for the systematic evaluation of empirical data. At the heart of FCA lies the concept lattice—a partially ordered set composed of "formal concepts," each representing a group of objects (the "extent") and attributes (the "intent"). Over time, FCA has become an influential methodology for tasks such as clustering, data analysis, information retrieval, and knowledge discovery.

Rough Set Theory, founded by Pawlak, offers a novel mathematical framework to handle imprecise, uncertain, or fuzzy knowledge. The primary elements of RST include approximation spaces and approximation operators, which allow for subsets to be estimated through lower and upper approximation sets. These approximations can then reveal implicit knowledge within information as decision rules. RST has gained significant interest and real-world application in areas like medicine, information analysis, data mining, and industrial control.

The paper examines a context K=(U, V, R), and by considering the complement relation of R, noted as R^C, constructs the corresponding context KC denoting context(U, V, R^C). Yao's research delineates the isomorphism between the rough operator-based lattice RO-L(K), the rough approximation lattice RA-L(K), and the classical concept lattice L(KC) of context KC.

RST and FCA each highlight distinct characteristics of data, and by integrating the two, researchers can derive what is known as the rough concept lattice for a given context. This paper explores the properties of rough concept lattices from the Domain Theory perspective, primarily focusing on their algebraic and complete distributivity traits. Additionally, the paper introduces the concept of definable sets within a context and investigates their algebraic features. The aim is to build novel connections between FCA, RST, and Domain Theory to enhance our understanding of these areas and inspire further research avenues.
