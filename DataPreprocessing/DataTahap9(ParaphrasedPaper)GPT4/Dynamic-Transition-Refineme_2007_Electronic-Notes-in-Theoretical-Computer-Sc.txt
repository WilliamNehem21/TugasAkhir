The paper discusses the need for a more adaptable form of refinement in systems that undergo updates, such as when managing versions in distributed systems. The authors propose the concept of dynamic transition refinement—adjustments that can occur during the runtime of a system and can be enacted by the system itself.

The paper is organized into different sections. Section 2 introduces marked transitions in Petri nets, defining super-dual nets and their operational rules. Section 3 extends this concept to object nets, introducing super-dual object nets, while Section 4 discusses how these new nets could be simulated using existing object nets. In Section 5, the authors discuss an early attempt to incorporate dynamic transition refinement into the Renew Petri net tool. The paper concludes with a summary, and an appendix reviews multi-set definitions.

The key innovation in the paper is the introduction of sub-nets as special tokens within transitions, which forms the basis for two main enhancements to Petri net formalism: using nets as tokens and marking transitions with these tokens. This enables the dynamic refinement process, allowing transitions to be updated during the system's operation.

Initial experimentation with these ideas was conducted using Renew's workflow plug-in, which didn't fully meet the intended design criteria but provided a close analogue for investigation.

The paper elaborates on Petri nets' ability to evolve structurally at runtime. Historically, self-modifying nets, which adapt according to marking-dependent arc weights, and concepts like mobile and recursive nets have previously been explored for structural modification.

The study concludes with the presentation of super-dual object net systems, an advancement on object net systems that allows for dynamic, runtime transition refinement. In this system, nets can reside within other nets and act as tokens—referred to as "net tokens" or "net-pokens"—that can move between transitions, refining them as needed. This capability delivers a process of refinement that is self-regulated by the system and can adjust on the fly.
