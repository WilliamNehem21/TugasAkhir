The academic paper describes the development of an innovative hypertextbook prototype designed to enhance learning in computer science by incorporating algorithm animations within the learning material. The prototype is integrated into the widely used Moodle Learning Management System (LMS). The paper outlines the objectives of the prototype module, the strategies for achieving these objectives, and showcases an example of content pages in Moodle. It also briefly evaluates the module's effectiveness and concludes with findings.

Key features of the prototype include visualization capabilities tailored for the Moodle platform. The authors have decided against supporting sub-chapters or deeper levels of content structure for simplicity and have not included interactive features like forums or chats within the module, though they can be linked. The module allows users to print chapters, including thumbnails, but as printed materials cannot display dynamic elements, the visualizations are rendered as static images.

The paper expresses an interest in collaboration with researchers and educators keen on utilizing the module, particularly those who wish to support other algorithm animation or visualization systems that run on Java WebStart. The authors acknowledge that not everyone uses Moodle due to varying institutional policies and state that most components of the module can be adapted for other content management systems like Drupal, Plone, or TYPO3, with Moodle-specific aspects such as user management and database connections needing modification for each new platform.
