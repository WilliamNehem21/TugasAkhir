In his doctoral thesis, Alves introduced a new method for standardizing n-graphs, which are visual representations of proofs in propositional classical logic as delineated in a system created by de Oliveira in 2001. The approach drew from Carbone's 1999 work on a combinatorial model to analyze proof transformation during cut elimination procedures.

N-graphs are constructed using 'proof-graphs', which are similar to Girard's proof-nets in linear logic, composed of legitimate links connecting nodes. Each node serves as the premise or conclusion for only a single link. An 'n-graph' in this context is a 'proof-graph' that accurately embodies a logical proof.

Alves' normalization approach is divided into two phases and involves four transformation sets plus an algorithm named 3CA for analyzing cycles within the n-graphs. The first stage addresses general proof-graphs, which include tree structures and certain types of cycles, while the second stage specifically targets the complexities of cycle structures. The process includes adding new vertices and linking them through expansions and contractions to manage premises and conclusions within the graph transformation.

Normalization is shown to consistently transform an n-graph into another valid n-graph by applying a set of reductions. This process is validated by theorem 3.5 for duplications of empires—a concept in graph theory—and by examining switchings for other reductions, ensuring the resulting structure remains acyclic and connected.

The normalization proof uses induction on several aspects: the order of cut formulas, the count of maximum-degree cuts in the proof, and the number of inversions in maximum/structural paths. The process ensures that each reduction either removes a maximum formula or decreases inversion counts in the graph. If new cuts are introduced, they are managed by applying reductions in a sequence that ensures the complexity, or degree, of the cut formulas is progressively diminished.

Overall, Alves' thesis contributes to the field of logical proof theory by extending de Oliveira's n-graph framework and introducing normalization techniques that maintain the integrity of the proof representation while simplifying its structure.
