This paper introduces a method for creating visual 2D occupancy grid maps from monocular camera input by utilizing homography matrix data. First, a segmentation process distinguishes floor from non-floor segments within the image, determining free space and obstacles. The findings are supported by practical experiments that validate this technique.

The environment is divided into a grid of discrete cells, M(x,y), each assigned a probability value between 0 and 1, indicating the likelihood of occupancy. A value of 0 represents an empty cell, while 1 indicates that a cell is occupied.

Building on prior work by Oriolo et al., the paper highlights the use of set theory (fuzzy logic) to address perception and planning problems under uncertainty. This approach models the map as a fuzzy set, with each point assigned a numerical value representing its possibility of being an obstacle. The key advantage is the ability to employ various fuzzy operators to handle uncertainties and integrate data from diverse sources.

Yguel et al. have provided another contribution by suggesting a wavelet-based storage and data representation strategy for occupancy grids, which tackles issues associated with managing large maps.

Additional factors, such as soil deformation, humidity, and temperature, can enhance environment depiction. The traditional SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) struggles to incorporate such auxiliary data, but Estrada et al. have developed the DenseSLAM method to integrate such information efficiently.

Addressing dynamic environment mapping, Andrade and Sanfeliu propose using a force formulation that decreases over time, applying a Kalman filter to reinforce and filter weak signals associated with marks reobserved in space.

Comparisons among different grid-based mapping methods for dynamic environments have been explored by Canas and Matellan.

To offload computation from the primary processor for other robotic tasks, Yguel et al. advocate the utilization of GPUs to synthesize information and construct grid maps. On a related note, Merhy et al. have proposed occupancy grid refinement techniques using probabilistic segmentation, treating grid cell probabilities as image texture levels.

Additional research has explored volumetric mapping via occupancy grids. One study utilized multiple cameras to track people in 3D grids in outdoor settings, while another employed stereo vision to map terrain height variance, aiding in the calculation of each cell's crossing probability within defective environments.

Even though optical sensor-based solutions offer many benefits, they also bring challenges such as lens distortion, limited field of view, and low resolution. Detailed analysis of these issues and potential solutions are discussed in the works of Taylor et al.

Moreover, mapping obstacles in the image to the 2D grid presents challenges, as the method relies on projective mapping, leaving cells that are not identified as free without acknowledgment. A developed algorithm reclassifies these non-free cells as either obstacle or occlusive to resolve this problem.
