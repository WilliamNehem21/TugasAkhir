Our research introduces a logic system that is a sophisticated alternative to ambient logic for outlining security properties. It leverages a single modality to express both spatial and temporal behaviors, instead of using two different modalities like ambient logic. Despite the singular modality, our logic is capable of addressing dynamic movement and nesting in system structures effectively. The logic also allows the application of existing model checking techniques used in temporal logics for scrutinizing models with security issues.

We use a graphical representation called labeled syntax trees, derived from ambient calculus, as the foundations for our logic's potential realities in a Kripke structure. These are essential for a propositional branching temporal logic that we've adopted. The relationships between the possible worlds in this structure reflect the evolution of the system's ambient calculus.

In traditional ambient logic, processes are seen as entities with both spatial and temporal characteristics. Our main contribution is to demonstrate that one can actually use a single modality to describe these entities by merely tracking changes over time to reconstruct the system's state at any point using our proposed logic based on ambient calculus.

To incorporate labels into the syntax trees of ambient calculus, we introduce an algebra that efficiently extends the ambient calculus's compositional operations to these labeled versions. These operations allow us to combine individual processes or behaviors to form complex system states.

We define what makes a statement or path within a structure valid or satisfiable. A state formula is valid if it holds true in every state of each possible system structure, whereas a path formula is valid if it holds true along every path of the system’s behavior. On the flip side, a formula is satisfiable if there exists at least one system structure in which the formula holds true.

The paper does not delve into the specifics of computing the accessibility relation, which pertains to how system states evolve. Instead, it focuses on conveying the fundamental concept behind the implementation of this logic.

Further, our work explores how this logic may prevent certain actions—such as consuming a capability—if not permitted by system rules, exemplified when one process precludes another action while it is active. Our investigation into ambient calculus revealed that standard approaches, such as modeling a firewall, might be insufficient as they often fail to handle multiple sequential interactions reflectively, which is where our logic shows promise in more aptly representing such scenarios.
