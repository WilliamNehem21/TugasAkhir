The paper discusses the use of string diagrams within abstract quantum mechanics and quantum informatics frameworks. In this context, categories are visualized with objects represented as strings and morphisms (arrows) represented as dots, where each morphism corresponds to an operation with one input and one output.

The paper specifies conditions such as injective maps (s) and fixpoint-free involutions (i), along with a connectedness condition. The terms "vertices" (set V), "half-edges/flags" (set H), and "oriented edges" (set E) are defined with respect to a graph structure, where "flags" are pairs consisting of a vertex and the starting segment of an edge. The involution (i) reverses the orientation of edges, the map (t) omits the edge, and the map (s) gives the edge emanating away from the vertex.

A "port" is defined as an (oriented) edge that is not the image of a certain map (s), and the collective set of these ports is called the interface of the graph. An "inner edge" refers to an element in the orbit of i, with both elements in the image of s.

The discussion moves toward a particular type of graph referred to as "n-f graphs," associated with certain decorations given by the graphical species f. The concept of a monad structure is introduced, which allows for the transformation of graphs with vertices decorated by smaller f-graphs into a single, larger f-graph by "erasing" the circles around the vertices.

The paper indicates that a formal argument for this endofunctor forming a monad structure can be found in referenced works. It suggests that there is a heuristic argument for this, which could be formalized into a proof.

Finally, the paper hints at future work, promising that the details regarding a left Kan extension preserved by the monad and dependent on a generic/free factorization will be published soon. This technical result contributes to the broader understanding of the mathematical structures that underpin quantum mechanics and quantum informatics.
