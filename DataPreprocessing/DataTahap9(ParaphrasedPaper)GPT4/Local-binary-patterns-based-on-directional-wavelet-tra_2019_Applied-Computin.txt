This paper presents a new approach for extracting facial features from images that vary in expression and pose, which can challenge the performance of existing feature extraction methods. The proposed technique combines interpolation-based Directional Wavelet Transform (DIWT) with Local Binary Patterns (LBP) to capture robust, locally discriminative features. The process involves an efficient direction assessment using quadtree partitioning, which aids in choosing optimal directions for DIWT sub-bands in facial regions. These selected sub-bands are then used to generate LBP histogram features for a comprehensive local feature set.

The proposed method was tested on the ORL, Georgia Tech (GT), and FEI face databases, demonstrating superior rank-one recognition rates when compared to several contemporary methods, including holistic approaches like LDA, local descriptor methods like LDP and WLD, and non-adaptive LBP-based multi-resolution analysis methods. The experiments were performed using MATLAB on an i3-330 CPU with 2 GB RAM, with the effectiveness measured by Cumulative Match Characteristic (CMC) curves. The results consistently showed that the new method achieves high accuracy, even with fewer training images, due to its adaptability and ability to preserve local facial details.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 reviews relevant methodologies including DIWT and LBP; Section 3 describes the proposed feature extraction method; Section 4 presents experimental results and comparisons; and Section 5 concludes with reflections on the method's performance.
