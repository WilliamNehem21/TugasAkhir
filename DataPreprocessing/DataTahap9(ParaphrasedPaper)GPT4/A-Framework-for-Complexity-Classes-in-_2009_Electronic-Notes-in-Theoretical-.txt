The current research on membrane computing models tackles several aspects: their universality in computational power, their efficiency considering computational complexity, and their relevance for biological modeling.

Rules are a core component of these models. In the original concept, rewriting rules allowed for the replacement of one multiset in a region with another, including indicators for whether objects stay or move to adjacent regions. Some models only use communication rules (like symport/antiport), which remain effective and powerful.

Rules in these systems are applied maximally and in parallel, meaning all possible applications occur simultaneously, with no inactive multiset when a rule can be applied. If multiple rule applications are possible, the system nondeterministically chooses one. Initially, rule priorities were incorporated, restricting rule application based on a hierarchy, though most modern models have dropped this feature. However, restrictions on parallelism exist in some models, either at the membrane level or system-wide.

An open question, the P-conjecture, speculates whether the complexity class for P systems with active membranes but without electrical charges is equivalent to P. There is supportive evidence that this holds true without dissolution rules and with division rules for non-elementary membranes. Conversely, it's shown that including dissolution rules expands the class's power to possibly include PSPACE, demonstrated by solutions to QSAT problems.

The dissolution rules' influence is significant in these P systems, where the remaining challenges include investigating the systems with only 2-division rules for elementary membranes or redefining division rules for non-elementary membranes.

Overall, complexity theory in membrane computing is an area with many complexities due to the system's nature. It lacks standard procedures for verification, making it difficult to formally prove that a designed family of P systems solves a given problem. The challenge is accentuated by the multitude of computation paths and the parallel evolution of numerous objects and membranes.
