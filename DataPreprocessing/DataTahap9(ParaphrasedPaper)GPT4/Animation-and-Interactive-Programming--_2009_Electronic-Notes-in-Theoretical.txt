This paper discusses an ongoing project aimed at engaging first-year university students from various educational backgrounds in programming principles through animation and interactive programming. The project particularly emphasizes the use of progressive programming tasks, culminating in students designing a breakout-style computer game to learn scripting and programming concepts. One of the key educational tools used is ActionScript for its immediate visual feedback and accessible syntax, which seems to be easier to learn and more beginner-friendly than other languages like C++ or JavaScript.

The course is part of an information and communications technology program common to all first-year students pursuing a communications degree. To evaluate the effectiveness of ActionScript in teaching programming and scripting principles, the paper reports on a survey conducted among the students. The survey examined students' prior experience with programming/scripting, their perceived difficulty in learning programming concepts without visualization, as well as their reasoning behind continuing with their chosen courses despite any difficulties encountered.

The survey revealed that a majority had some prior programming experience, with varied exposure to different high-level languages. Difficulty in acquiring programming fluency was a common concern among students. Interestingly, those with no prior programming or scripting experience reported finding ActionScript a helpful tool in understanding basic concepts, possibly because of their experience with video/audio editing, web design, and image editing.

Overall, the practical assessments indicated that student performance and engagement improved over time, demonstrating the success of using ActionScript and the interactive game design approach in teaching programming skills to first-year students.
