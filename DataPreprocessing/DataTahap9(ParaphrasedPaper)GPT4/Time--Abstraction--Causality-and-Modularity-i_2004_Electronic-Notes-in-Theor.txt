Causality is intertwined with the concept of time, a fundamental aspect in modeling systems. Time can be modeled in two primary ways: as discrete (like in digital systems) or as continuous (similar to analog systems). A key issue for system models is their approach to modeling time, which impacts causalityâ€”the notion that an output is dependent on an input.

Causality reflects the dependencies among actions in a system's information exchange. Interface behaviors, the relationships determined by functions with set values, are instrumental in examining the causal relationships in systems.

The timing of input and output is central to defining causality in interface behaviors. An output causally linked to an input cannot occur before the input is processed. However, with precise timing, a system can have an instantaneous response, where output at time t can depend on input at time t. Potential issues arise when considering delay-free feedback loops, which can lead to causal loops, operationally implausible behaviors that cannot occur in practice. To prevent this, the concept of time needs to accommodate a robust definition of causality.

Without a comprehensive grasp of causality as part of a component's interface abstraction, it's difficult to predict event outcomes. Without causality, you can't prevent causal loops or correctly deduce deadlock properties. Essentially, interface abstraction without full causality cannot accurately reflect the system's potential behaviors.

Abstracting time by making the scale coarser by a factor of n introduces nondeterminism and underspecification, which can lead to a loss of causality information. Removing all time information is an extreme form of time abstraction that can result in either increased nondeterminism if output depends on input timing or increased determinism if it only depends on the order and values of inputs. However, even in the latter case, important causality information may be lost.

Strong causality offers several benefits, simplifying the analysis of systems and allowing for concrete reasoning. This is especially useful in dealing with feedback loops, because in systems with strong causality, time guardedness facilitates the determination of unique fixpoints for deterministic functions. Under strong causality, all fixpoints uphold causal relationships, streamlining system analysis.
