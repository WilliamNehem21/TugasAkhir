This academic paper presents the development of the Extensible Algorithm Animation Language (XAAL), which aims to facilitate the exchange of data between various algorithm visualization (AV) systems. Recognizing that educators often encounter difficulties sourcing and generating interactive visualizations, the paper acknowledges the existence of several AV systems like ANIMAL, JAWAA, and MatrixPro. To improve the usability of these tools for teachers, an effort was made to integrate them, allowing for selection based on the desired level of interaction.

The working group previously generated XML specifications for different facets of AV, but many remained merely illustrative. Advancing this work, the authors offer more substantial specifications through XAAL. Furthermore, a suite of tools is introduced which is intended to enable data interchange between existing AV systems and support various export formats.

XAAL leverages XML's accessibility to software and ease of transformation, enabling the straightforward creation and processing of data. A survey of existing algorithm animation languages led to a taxonomy that splits the features of such languages into three groups: data structures, graphical primitives, and the animation itself. This taxonomy guided the development of XAAL to handle different approaches to AV used by tools like ANIMAL and MatrixPro.

Key features of XAAL include graphical primitives for building complex objects and reusable shapes and styles to simplify the creation process. XAAL also adopts data structures for ease of visualization production, with support for different levels of complexity and optional graphical representations for each structure. Moreover, XAAL accommodates abstract operations like insert, delete, and search, with optional visual instructions.

An XML schema divides XAAL into modular documents to facilitate modification and reuse, and the paper introduces processing pipelines to support XAAL integration into existing AV systems. A prototype implementation and several transformations are briefly described.

In conclusion, the paper offers an XML-based language and tools for algorithm animation based on ITiCSE XMLWG's work, discussing the benefits for its members, AV system developers, and teachers aiming to employ AV in education.
