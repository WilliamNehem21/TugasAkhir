This paper focuses on digital representations of portions of the Euclidean plane and other surfaces, providing a set of axioms that define a broad category of such spaces, known as Generalized Abstract Digital Spaces (GADS). These include spaces related to well-studied adjacency pairs in 2D digital topology. The paper builds on previous work by one of the authors, adapting the mathematical framework to define GADS.

The study introduces the concept of intersection numbers between two paths on a GADS, demonstrating that this number remains unchanged when the paths are homotopically deformedâ€”a generalization of earlier work by another author and a colleague. Furthermore, the paper offers a definition for discrete planar GADS that align with the Euclidean plane and includes a digital version of the Jordan Curve Theorem, relying exclusively on discrete methods as opposed to continuous analogs used in prior research.

The paper also describes a singularity in a GADS, which is a vertex around which loops are not strongly connected; vertices without this property are considered non-singular. It is noted that even a strongly connected GADS may contain singularities, as illustrated with an example.

Lastly, the paper highlights the potential to extend previous digital topology findings to GADS, mentioning the challenge of advancing these theories within the context of 3D spaces.
