The Verification Logic for Rewriting Logic (VLRL) is an action-based modal logic that utilizes rewrite rules to represent system actions and is useful for checking system properties described in rewriting logic. VLRL enables users to define observations that focus on specific behaviors of the system, which they deem important.

The academic paper discusses how observations are formulated into propositions and further details the conversion of a VLRL action formula into Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), with Section 5 demonstrating this by leveraging the Maude model checker to validate some VLRL formulas. An example provided in the appendix underscores the entire process.

In the process of system verification, the paper highlights a challenge: when simulating concurrent actions in Maude, concurrent steps are broken down into single steps because Maude's model checker can only process one-step rewrites at a time. This limitation makes it necessary to translate rules from the original theory into individual rules within the transformed theory and then use their interleaving in the model checker to represent all possible concurrent executions.

The transformation process introduces various operations: one that elaborates a state with the action that led to it, one that identifies the specific subterm for the rewrite rule application, and operations that manipulate the marks on states for the proper execution of rules and the construction of composite actions.

The adaptability of this procedure to any system specified in rewriting logic is underscored. For systems with a commutative and associative structure (like the mutex example given), modifications to the approach should be minimal. However, more complex theories require a nuanced approach, potentially involving multiple sorts of actions and the respective extension of operators within the signature to cater to different rule types.
