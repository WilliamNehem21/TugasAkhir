While the foundational concept of trading in stock markets is straightforward—purchase at a low price and sell at a high price—the actual decision-making around the timing and quantity of stocks to buy or sell is complex. To navigate this challenge, investors have developed various strategies, among which speculative analysis serves as a key approach. Speculative analysis involves interpreting market data to forecast trends of increasing and decreasing stock prices. Specifically, technical analysis, a subset of speculative analysis, stands out as a popular tool for supporting investment decisions due to its effectiveness and ease of use.
