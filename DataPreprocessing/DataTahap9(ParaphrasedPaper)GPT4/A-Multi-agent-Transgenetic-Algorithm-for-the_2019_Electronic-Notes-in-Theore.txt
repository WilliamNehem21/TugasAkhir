The paper outlines a new variation of the Transgenetic Algorithm (TGA), called TMA, aimed at solving the Bi-Objective Spanning Tree (BIST) problem, which is an NP-hard problem similar to the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) problem but with two conflicting objectives. The BIST problem represents real-world scenarios where two objectives need to be optimized at the same time. Previously proposed solutions to this problem have often been heuristic, with evolutionary techniques being a common approach. 

TGAs, as one category of these evolutionary techniques, take inspiration from natural processes like horizontal gene transfer and symbiosis. They involve three primary components: a population of solutions (endosymbionts), a repository of information (host cell), and agents (transgenetic agents) that manipulate the solutions. Different types of transgenetic agents exist, some for diversifying and others for intensifying the search. 

The proposed TMA differs from existing TGAs in that it automatically decides which search mechanisms or transgenetic agents to use during execution, rather than relying on predetermined parameters. The paper describes the TLP, which is the specific TGA previously proposed, and then introduces the new TMA in detail, including the mechanism for generating initial populations and the various plasmids and transposons used as transgenetic agents.

The research compares TMA to TLP and a well-known genetic algorithm for bi-objective problems, the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), on 165 benchmark instances. The study measured solution quality and processing times and employed statistical tests such as the Friedman test and the Holm posthoc test to evaluate the significance of the results. 

In most cases where TMA ranked better than the TLP and NSGA-II, the differences were statistically significant. The paper acknowledges a few exceptions where the TLP performed similarly on certain groups of instances based on specific quality indicators (HV and IGD). 

The success rates of the various transgenetic agents were measured and contributed differently depending on the instance class, indicating the effectiveness of certain plasmids and transposons over others.

Ultimately, the new TMA was found to produce superior solutions, both in quality and processing time, compared to the other algorithms tested. The paper concludes by suggesting that future work could extend the algorithm to address many-objective problems.
