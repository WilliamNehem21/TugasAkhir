In this work, we address the limitations of a functor by enhancing the target category into which it maps. Although this functor is reliable in its mappings, it lacks the ability to fully reflect the complexities of the category of games, including important features like the monoidal structure. Our goal is to fine-tune the target category in stages to more accurately capture the characteristics of the category of games, building upon the foundational work of Hyland and Schalk.

We begin by modifying the COH category by introducing an order relation, designed to resemble the prefix order found in the interactive sequences of games. We designate this new, ordered version of the category as PCOH and demonstrate that it retains a monoidal structure similar to the original category of games. The core contribution of our research is to establish that the functor described by Hyland and Schalk can be extended to a fully faithful strong monoidal embedding within a certain subset of the PCOH category.
