Improvements in computer systems and the widespread connectivity of Internet of Things (IoT) devices have made mobile and embedded systems primary repositories for sensitive information such as financial and personal data. This situation has heightened the risk of secret data being stolen through side-channel signals from these devices. Prior research has focused on the susceptibility of cryptographic devices to side-channel attacks, revealing that these attacks can bypass existing security measures and should be taken into account in system design.

To mitigate these vulnerabilities, recent studies have suggested a communication model at the program-level for signal transmission that intentionally varies signaling time. They defined theoretical limits on the amount of data that could leak through electromagnetic (EM) covert channels, based on the assumption that signaling time variations could be accounted for by altering the timing of pulses without changing their width. However, these studies had limitations; they concentrated solely on EM covert channels, overlooked data loss from errors like deletions, assumed pulse widths remained constant, and presented theoretical limits instead of actual capacity measurements. They also assumed that a zero bit was represented by a silent signal, and that the signal timing distribution was statistically the same for all bits.

The paper addresses these limitations by proposing a more general communication model for various covert channels that accounts for insertions, deletions, and the asynchronous nature of signals, improving the accuracy of leakage capacity calculations.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 explains the model for the transmitter, receiver, and communication channel; Section 3 derives effective channel noise and leakage capacity; Section 4 applies the model to different types of covert channels; Section 5 describes the experimental setup and results; and Section 6 offers concluding thoughts.

The new model acknowledges the asynchronous nature of transmitter signals and adapts to variations in signaling time. The receiver is depicted as a pulse-shape filter, and the paper defines effective channel noise comprising both additive and timing-related 'jitter' noise. The proposed memoryless channel model incorporates effective channel noise, insertions, and deletions.

The paper also explores how power analysis-based covert channels, which rely on power consumption while processing bits, should use a different modulation scheme to represent system activity accurately. By identifying parameters for deletions, insertions, and effective variation distributions, the new methodology can evaluate a system's robustness against EM-based covert channels, which take advantage of power management units (PMU) and voltage regulator modules (VRM).

The researchers conduct experimental analysis on devices such as an Altera Nios-II processor, an Olinuxino board with a modern Cortex A8 ARM core, and a Dell Precision 7730 laptop, using custom-built and high-gain antennas and a spectrum analyzer. They observe that different covert channels have unique characteristics, including varying transmission rates and noise properties.

The study concludes by proposing a method to assess signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) versus leakage capacity, aiding designers in determining whether their systems are sufficiently secure or require further modifications for privacy protection.
