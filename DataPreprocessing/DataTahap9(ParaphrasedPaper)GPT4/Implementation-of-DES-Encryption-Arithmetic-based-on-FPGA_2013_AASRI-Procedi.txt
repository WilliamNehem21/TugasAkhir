The Data Encryption Standard (DES) utilizes a unique key for encryption, which is essential for the subsequent decryption process. DES is a classic example of a block cipher that converts a fixed-length string of plaintext bits into a cipher text bit string of identical length through a series of complex operations. The block size in DES is 64 bits. Although the key appears to be 64 bits in length, only 56 bits are actually used for encryption, as the remaining 8 bits are employed for parity checking and are not used by the encryption algorithm itself.

Like other block ciphers, DES on its own is not considered secure and needs to be employed within a mode of operation to enhance its security. The key is typically shared or stored in a format of eight bytes, with one bit in each byte being used to conduct error checking during the key's distribution, generation, and storage, ensuring that each byte has odd parity.

For large-scale designs involving hundreds of basic gates, using graphical representations can be challenging. This necessitates the use of hardware description languages (HDLs), which provide a standard way to describe the behavior and structure of electronic circuits using text-based expressions. HDLs, such as VHDL, are the preferred method for designing logic in field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). VHDL, in particular, was developed for describing the behavior of electronic systems, including FPGAs and application-specific integrated circuits. The language is used to define the functionality of electronic components across numerous applications. Accurate electrical circuit modeling is enhanced through the generation of VHDL simulation models, which serve as the basis for constructing larger circuits in combination with schematics and system-level descriptions.

Upon completing a design, its correctness needs to be verified by simulation, followed by programming the resulting design into an FPGA chip. Simulation is an essential step to ensure the design's accuracy. Software such as Quartus II can be used for simulating the behavior of a design, with the simulation results being presented in the form of an oscillogram.
