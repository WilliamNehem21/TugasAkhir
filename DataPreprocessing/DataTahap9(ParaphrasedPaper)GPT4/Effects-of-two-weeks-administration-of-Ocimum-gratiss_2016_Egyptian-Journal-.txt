The study involves three experimental groups of rats. Group 2, the toxic control group, included 10 rats that were administered 100 mg/kg/day of gentamicin intraperitoneally for one week. Groups 3, 4, and 5 each had 5 rats, and they were also pretreated with gentamicin in the same manner as Group 2. Following this, groups 3, 4, and 5 received 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg/day doses, respectively, of aqueous Ocimum gratissimum leaf extract (AOGL) orally for 14 days. The study observed significant improvements in the kidney tissue damage caused by gentamicin after treatment with AOGL, suggesting the extract's potential for managing gentamicin-induced kidney damage.

To prepare the leaf extract, Ocimum gratissimum leaves were collected, cleaned, dried in the shade, and ground into a fine powder. The powder (323 g) was then extracted with 3 liters of distilled water for 48 hours using an electric shaker. The mixture was filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure to yield a residue which was stored for use in the study.

Rat food and water consumption were measured by weighing leftovers after 24 hours, and the resultant values were considered as the daily intake for each group. Water intake and urine output were measured with cylinders, while food consumption was gauged using a digital scale.

Around 3 ml of blood was collected into EDTA tubes, centrifuged, and the plasma analyzed for creatinine, urea, and total protein levels. Similar methods were used for urine samples. The rats' kidneys were weighed and processed for biochemical analysis of glutathione and TBARS (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances).

Interestingly, the gentamicin-treated rats showed no significant decrease in food consumption and body weight, contrasting with other studies that observed weight loss after gentamicin treatment. This study also noted histological changes in rats' intestines after AOGL administration, such as increased villi and larger goblet cells, which could enhance nutrient absorption. The weight gain seen in AOGL-treated groups may be related to the extract's hypothesized inhibition of intestinal motility, increased villi count, and larger goblets cells, which facilitate nutrient uptake. Differences in the outcomes as compared to other studies might be due to variations in dosages or the hypoglycemic properties of certain phytochemicals in the extract.

The study found that the urine output decreased significantly in the group receiving just gentamicin, indicative of renal function impairment. However, recovery in creatinine and urea levels towards normal was observed in the AOGL-treated groups. This suggests potential renal tubule regeneration and improved kidney function.

Creatinine clearance also decreased with gentamicin treatment, signifying diminished glomerular filtration and renal blood flow, possibly due to vascular resistance or capillary damage. Yet, AOGL treatment seemed to improve creatinine clearance, suggesting restored kidneys.

Toxic control rats exhibited increased urinary protein, implying inflammation in the glomerular capillaries. However, AOGL treatment appeared to reduce urine protein levels, potentially due to its antioxidant properties that could mitigate ROS-related glomerular filtration damage.

The toxic control group presented higher TBARS levels and diminished GSH, marking increased oxidative stress. Treatment with AOGL seemed to reverse these markers, implying its antioxidant efficacy.

Overall, the study demonstrated the potential of Ocimum gratissimum to restore kidney function in rats with gentamicin-induced nephrotoxicity, as evidenced by improved renal function markers and antioxidative enzyme levels in treated rats.
