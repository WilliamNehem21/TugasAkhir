The academic paper suggests that during chemical reactions, new bonds are formed between previously unbound sites, or entirely new molecules are synthesized, which necessarily become linked to existing molecules on the left-hand side of the reaction equation. Conversely, the breakdown of molecules occurs when bonds are destroyed. The paper assumes that both reactants and products in a reaction always contain at least one component or part.
