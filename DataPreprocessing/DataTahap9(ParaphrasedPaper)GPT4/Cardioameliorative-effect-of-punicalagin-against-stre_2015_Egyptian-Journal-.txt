This study investigated the effects of punicalagin on heart-related complications in rats with diabetes induced by streptozotocin (STZ). Male rats were injected with STZ to induce diabetes and then treated with punicalagin intermittently over 15 days. Punicalagin ameliorated metabolic risks, oxidative stress, inflammation, and DNA damage in the diabetic hearts, demonstrating cardioprotective properties.

With diabetic rats, punicalagin reduced levels of cardiac troponin T, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB)—indicators of heart damage—and improved heart histopathological conditions. Punicalagin modulated apoptosis by affecting pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins (e.g., p53, Bax, caspases, and Bcl-2), suggesting its potential to alter both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways.

The administration of punicalagin alone had no significant impact on body weight, blood glucose, insulin, lipid profiles, interleukins (IL-1β, IL-6), or antioxidant enzyme activities. However, it did increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and glutathione (GSH) levels in the heart.

The study's findings highlight punicalagin's therapeutic potential in treating diabetes and lessening its cardiac complications by its anti-apoptotic, DNA-protective, and antioxidant functions, particularly by modulating p53 and bolstering Bcl-2 expression to counter oxidative stress.
