This paper presents research on an icing rate sensor utilizing infrared spectrum absorption, employing two infrared laser diodes. These diodes are operated via a pulse circuit, which is central to the technology of the sensor. This new sensor offers advantages over conventional rotating filter systems, being more compact, easier to integrate, and providing more reliable performance.

Icing on aircraft surfaces is recognized as a significant hazard that can cause catastrophes. Ice formation is rapid and can severely impact the aerodynamics of an aircraft, reducing efficiency and potentially rendering it unable to fly. Ice can also overwhelm engine power and cause malfunctions in vital systems including control panels, brakes, and landing gear. The infrared spectrum absorption-based icing rate sensor developed in this study is capable of precisely measuring the rate of ice accumulation on surfaces, particularly useful for helicopters in hover.

The sensor system amplifies bi-directional signals using a preamplifier circuit, then filters and converts them to digital signals via an AD converter within the detection circuit. These digital signals are subsequently changed back to analog by a DA converter. The derived signals, which indicate ice thickness, are then transmitted to a higher-level system or display device through the communication interface of the detection circuit.

Achieving high light intensity and spectral stability is crucial for the infrared absorption-based icing rate sensor. Factors impacting this include the nature of the light itself, ambient temperature, and the current driving the light source. To this end, the paper outlines the design of a high-precision constant current source drive circuit and a temperature control circuit, aimed at maintaining optimal light source performance.
