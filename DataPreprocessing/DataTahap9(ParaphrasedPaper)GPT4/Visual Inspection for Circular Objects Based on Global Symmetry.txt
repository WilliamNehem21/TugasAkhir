The study focuses on developing an automated system for visually inspecting circular objects using cameras and image processing. Its primary objective is to analyze the patterns of circular objects through image analysis. Initially, the authors introduce a computational approach for object localization that leverages global symmetry. This approach involves devising a symmetry metric that incorporates distance, phase, and intensity weights. This metric is effective in pinpointing the centers of circles, including those with low contrast against complex and uncertain backgrounds. The authors also apply this metric to evaluate the similarities between various circular objects, with the results showing promise.

Humans have an innate ability to notice defects in objects, such as chipped edges or dirty surfaces, by recognizing symmetry. Although symmetry detection has shown much potential for applications based on computer vision, it has rarely been integrated into actual vision-based applications. Furthermore, isolating objects from messy backgrounds remains difficult, particularly when the objects' contrasts are poor or lighting conditions vary. Classic methods for circle identification in images, like moments, Hough transforms, and least-squares methods, often fail under these challenging conditions.

The paper details symmetry in terms of intensity, structure, and direction. The point of highest symmetry measurement signifies the center of circular objects. In cluttered scenes, this method effectively excludes noise due to its irregular and asymmetric nature.

In conclusion, the paper offers a systematic method for the robust inspection of circular objects. The proposed symmetry metric can be used for direct inspection of symmetrically patterned circular objects and can also locate any circular object against uncertain backgrounds. Once an object is located, a content-based descriptor is used to complete the inspection process.
