As online voting becomes increasingly widespread, ensuring the security of internet polls is a critical challenge. This paper introduces an advanced method that enhances the security of online surveys by distinguishing votes made by real humans from those generated by automated bots. The method's concept, security features, and testing outcomes on a prototype are detailed. Additionally, a public challenge is proposed to further assess the effectiveness and robustness of the security solution.

Online surveys are used to gauge opinions on specific topics. However, they are vulnerable to attacks, particularly the manipulation of results by bots designed to vote repetitively. Traditional CAPTCHA-based defenses, which present distorted text images, have been compromised by bots capable of analyzing variations in text lengths.

To address this, the paper proposes a new technique that utilizes the human ability to recognize unfamiliar objects in images as a test to differentiate humans from bots. This prevents automated programs from altering poll results significantly. This method is fair, as it allows multiple human users to vote from the same IP address, only restricting access when numerous test failures suggest a bot attack. It is also inclusive of visually impaired individuals by providing an alternative audio challenge.

The defense system employs a vast database of images across many categories to prevent the likelihood of encountering the same image twice, complicating the task for automated classification. Each image is transformed through resizing, rotating, flipping, and potentially distorting, alongside color shading modifications, to hinder attacks based on image comparison or color recognition.

Images are associated with multiple categories to enhance security. An algorithm ensures that the categories shown in the poll have distinct pictures, eliminating the chance of recognizing an object present in both pictures. This counters similarity-based attacks, where bots compare collected reference images to those presented in the poll.

To validate the proposed solution, the researchers developed a prototype and simulated bot behavior, testing against common attack strategies, and launched an internet-wide open challenge.

The proposed picture-based scheme effectively combats automatic alterations of internet poll results. It embeds CAPTCHA directly within the poll page and leverages the current inability of computers to recognize pictures and sounds accurately. The solution is fair, robust against automated classification, and easily integrated into internet platforms for broad survey visibility and access.
