The paper discusses a tracking system implemented on embedded smart cameras developed by the authors, aimed at enabling long-term, multi-camera tracking of targets. The system calculates overlapping views between cameras and uses homography for target handover. To address the significant computational demands, the authors propose a novel hierarchical optimization strategy which dramatically reduces complexity by 98.84%. This makes the system suitable for real-time operations and additional biometric tasks like recognition. The paper is structured into sections covering the multi-camera tracking system, hierarchical optimization method, experiments and results, and conclusions.

For single-camera tracking, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) are used for background subtraction and blob extraction to track moving objects. MeanShift and Kalman filter algorithms are applied to analyse motion history and trajectory. To optimize real-time performance on the embedded system, which features the TI dual-core TMS320DM6446 (ARM+DSP), the video feed is downsampled to reduce computational load. The processing enhancements were validated through profiling using Code Composer Studio.

The entire system demonstrates robust real-time tracking across multiple cameras on the embedded platform. Implementation and optimization tailored for the TI TMS320DM6446 have confirmed the system's effectiveness in dynamic, real-world environments.
