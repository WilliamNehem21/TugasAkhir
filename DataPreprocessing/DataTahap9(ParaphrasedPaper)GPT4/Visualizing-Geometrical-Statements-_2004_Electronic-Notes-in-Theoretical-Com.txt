This paper presents a system that integrates a dynamic geometry software with a theorem proving tool to improve the interaction between humans and machines in the context of geometrical reasoning. This system allows users to modify geometric theorem statements, deduce their proofs, and visualize them using the geometry software. A central feature of the system is an algorithm that extracts necessary information for creating geometric constructions from the formal theorem statements. The paper showcases examples from their tool, named GeoView.

The authors developed a library aligned with French high-school geometry curriculum, focusing on two-dimensional Euclidean geometry and three-dimensional geometric concepts such as parallelism and orthogonality. They excluded analytic geometry to emphasize on geometric reasoning over calculation.

Describing their algorithm, they mention constructing a matrix that meets certain criteria, which is iteratively adjusted by shifting its positive entries to satisfy two additional conditions or the process fails.

The authors acknowledge a limitation of their approach, where it might not generate a construction even from resolvable geometric constraints due to the non-linear nature of these constraints. This could result in an indeterminate freedom not suited for points but rather for coordinates or more complicated structures.

They also contemplate extending their work to three-dimensional geometry, though representing three-dimensional shapes on a two-dimensional display introduces challenges. Planes in 3D space are particularly difficult to depict, as a plane represented by a parallelogram may not always show the intersection of two planes, and non-intersecting lines can mistakenly appear intersecting.
