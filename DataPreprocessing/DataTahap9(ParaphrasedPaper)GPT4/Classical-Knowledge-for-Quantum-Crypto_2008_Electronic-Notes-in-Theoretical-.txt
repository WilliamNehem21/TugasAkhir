In this paper, we demonstrate the security of quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols against multiple types of attacks by using a classical knowledge framework for quantum systems. This framework, previously established, is now utilized to define security as a logical property, where we employ meta-logical analysis on the finite state machine representing the QKD protocol. The novelty of our work lies in the application of a logic-based perspective despite previous explorations of these security concerns.

Existing definitions of protocol security often lack the higher level of abstraction needed for systematic analysis and understanding of protocol interplay, posing a challenge to assess the security in actual implementations. Formal methods, which use clearly defined protocol languages, allow for systematic representation, property definition, and support automated proof techniques, which are particularly valuable in the complex field of cryptographic protocols analysis.

Despite the quantum community's view of QKD security as effectively resolved, formal analysis remains indispensable. Theoretical security proofs do not account for the practical security involving hardware, which is crucial because hardware vulnerabilities can introduce backdoors, such as timing attacks exemplified in RSA cryptography. Formal methods can adapt to these scenarios, offering protection against a wider range of threats.

Research into formal methods for distributed quantum computation is relatively new, with limited output. Several formal languages for protocol specification have emerged, some influenced by classical process calculi or dynamic logic. A few of these incorporate logical tools for protocol analysis and assert correctness properties, though only specific frameworks include epistemic operators. The concept of knowledge in quantum distributed systems had been previously defined independently of any particular protocol specification language.

Before we can apply modal operators to either knowledge or time, we must first clarify the propositions these operators affect. We do not aim to construct an exhaustive language for primitive propositions but instead provide an abstract framework, outlining rules for standard logical combinations and discussing examples of pertinent properties later.

We then proceed to affirm within our logical framework that QKD is secure against various attacks, focusing on its foundational aspects and the innovative logical approach. We begin by establishing that eavesdroppers listening in on classical channels cannot discern the keyâ€”a crucial confirmation of the inherent value of QKD over traditional classical private symmetric secret key establishment protocols.
