In this academic paper, the authors discuss an exemplary case from the 1980s where David Chaum presented an anonymous electronic cash system capable of exposing a user's secrets if they were caught double-spending, which is an illegal act. This feature served as a method for revoking anonymity when necessary. Following Chaum's work, other similar systems were developed, but no other examples are known to the authors.

The paper proceeds to reveal a generalized attack that involves collusion between a compromised revocation authority and various verifiers. It addresses a common method of revocation present in several systems, which is further elaborated in the appendix. In these systems, there is a publicly accessible revocation list coded with secret keys; this list can be read by anyone, but only the revocation authority has the power to modify it.

The authors share in Remark 2.3 that there is a hope that future technology may enable trustless transactions without relying on a revocation authority (RA) to not link them. However, all personal anonymous credential systems they have reviewed are vulnerable to this attack. Trust in the RA not to issue permanent false revocations is deemed insufficient; additional trust is needed to prevent temporary revocation abuses.

Finally, there is a lack of clarity regarding the certification of specific attributes within these systems. The authors express uncertainty about whether this ambiguity can be exploited to deceive verifiers during the credential presentation process. They suggest that the issuer should be certain about the attributes they certify at the conclusion of the issuing protocol, both for technical and legal reasons.
