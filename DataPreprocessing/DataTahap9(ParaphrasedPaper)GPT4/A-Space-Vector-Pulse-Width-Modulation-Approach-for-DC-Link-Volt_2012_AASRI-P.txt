Researchers have developed methods for maintaining the stability of the neutral point in three-level three-phase neutral-point-clamped (NPC) voltage source inverters (VSIs) by using algorithms to control the inverter switching. Josep Pou and colleagues have utilized a feedforward space-vector pulse width modulation (SVPWM) strategy for DC-link voltage balancing, which involves complex calculations of duty cycles. Jian-Yong Zheng and others have suggested a novel modulation technique based on the use of virtual vectors, which ensures DC-link voltage balance across the entire modulation scope for any load. However, this approach was implemented using carrier-based PWM, which requires the calculations of angles and trigonometric ratios. Amit Kumar Gupta and colleagues have achieved full control over DC-link balance in a three-level NPC inverter, a process that is highly dependent on both the modulation index and the angle of the reference vector.

One of the primary challenges in maintaining DC-link balance is the impact of medium vectors, which affect phase currents. When phase currents are present, it is difficult to achieve capacitor balance. Du Toit Mouton and team have suggested that by strategically using short, zero, and large vectors, and avoiding medium vectors, proper capacitor balance can be achieved.
