This study explores a method for measuring flow rate using an inductance-based sensor system. Rather than directly measuring the flow rate, the system determines it by measuring the displacement of a float and correlating that with inductance. By using a series of circuits connected to an inductance sensor, the displacement of the float is translated into an inductance measurement, which the MSP430 processor then interprets as flow rate data. This data is then used to display the flow rate on-site and can also be transmitted remotely. This method allows for digital and intelligent flow rate measurement without requiring electrical contact with the fluid.

Additionally, the study discusses a rectifier circuit that employs components with unipolar conductivity to convert alternating sine wave AC voltage into unidirectional pulse voltage. Since the resulting pulsating voltage is not ideal due to its high ripple content, a filter comprising capacitors, inductors, and other energy storage devices is utilized to minimize the pulse components. This process smooths out the output voltage, making it more stable and useful for the system's requirements.
