The dataset collected by Matek et al. consists of 171,375 images from 945 patients with various blood diseases, treated at the MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory. The ages of patients ranged from 18.1 years to 92.2 years, with a median age of 69.3 years and a mean age of 65.6 years.

To address the problem of class imbalances in the dataset, where the number of images per class ranged from 8 to 29,000, the study used data augmentation techniques to increase the representation of underrepresented classes. Data augmentation methods included rotations, translations, zooming, adding noise, cropping, and flipping images.

Data augmentation led to improvements in the morphological classification of leukocytes, with the neural network model demonstrating accurate predictions. The study assessed the model's performance using precision and recall metrics.

This paper introduced a new model combining convolutional and attention networks (CoAtNet) for classifying cell morphology based on the comprehe
