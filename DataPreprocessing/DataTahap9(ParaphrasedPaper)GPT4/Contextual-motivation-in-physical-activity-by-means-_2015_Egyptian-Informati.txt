The rest of the paper is structured in the following manner: Section 2 provides a concise review of the literature concerning the use of association rule mining (ARM) in various fields. Section 3 discusses the theory and algorithms of ARM. Section 4 presents the research methodology employed in this study. Section 5 contains the findings and discussions, and the paper concludes with Section 6.

A novel diagnostic method is introduced, utilizing relational association rule systems (ARS) and a supervised learning algorithm, which facilitates the creation of a programming interface aimed at diagnosing serious health conditions. This interface offers an innovative diagnostic approach and aids in developing software that can estimate the likelihood of a disease. It is designed to be highly adaptable and can effortlessly integrate new symptoms of any disease, according to Gupta et al.

The paper further highlights the significant role of ARM as a data mining technique within healthcare informatics. Notably, this paper extends the relevance of ARM to address contemporary public health issues, emphasizing the role of physical activity in managing exercise routines to promote a healthy lifestyle. The relationship between physical activity and health is well-documented, and sedentary lifestyles are recognized as a significant risk factor for poor health.

This research applies ARM to comprehend and tackle the challenge of physical activity and exercise habits. In particular, it explores the connection between light exercise and regular sleeping patterns, suggesting that there is strong support and confidence that individuals who exercise are also likely to have consistent sleep. The paper advocates for incorporating mild exercise before sleep, asserting that while the type of exercise can vary, it should be gentle enough not to disrupt sleep. Following this is a section detailing the experimental assessment of the research using the principles of ARM.
