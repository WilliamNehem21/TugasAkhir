This academic paper explores the concept of bialgebras within the compact closed category of sets and binary relations, referred to as Rel. The authors delve into how this structure allows for the emergence of various monoidal categories with additional properties when considering the (co)modules of bialgebras in Rel. They highlight how, by employing the quantum double construction, they are able to produce a ribbon category comprised of crossed G-sets (associated with a group G) as the modules of a Hopf algebra within Rel. This specific category of crossed G-sets is proposed as a framework for a braided version of propositional linear logic.

The paper is organized into several sections:
- Section 2: This section outlines foundational concepts of monoidal categories and bialgebras to set the stage for the following discussions.
- Section 3: The authors consider bialgebras derived from monoids and groups and investigate their associated (co)modules categories within Rel.
- Section 4: The quantum double construction process in Rel is described here, which leads to the formulation of the category of crossed G-sets. This section also touches on the application of this category as a model for braided linear logic.

An example is provided in Section 2.3 to illustrate the classical framework of the category of vector spaces over a field K (denoted as Vect_K) and linear maps. The paper explains that Vect_K is a symmetric monoidal category with the tensor product of vector spaces serving as the monoidal product and K acting as the tensor unit. Within this context, a monoid corresponds to an algebra, and a comonoid to a coalgebra in the conventional sense. The concepts of modules, comodules, bialgebras, and Hopf algebras within Vect_K are also consistent with their traditional interpretations in the mathematical literature.
