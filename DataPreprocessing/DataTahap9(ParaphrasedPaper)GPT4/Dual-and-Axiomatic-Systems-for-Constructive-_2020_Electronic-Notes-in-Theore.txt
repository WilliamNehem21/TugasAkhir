The significance of modal logic within the realms of philosophy, mathematics, and computer science is firmly acknowledged, especially in light of its role in type theories connected to concurrent and distributed computing. As a result, verification of modal logic systems has become integral, necessitating the use of proof assistants.

In addressing modal logic, the authors note the necessitation rule, which ensures that the necessity operator is only applied to theorems, resolving debates surrounding the validity of the deduction theorem. Further, the adoption of a multiplicative style for the modus ponens rule aligns with traditional axiomatic systems and brings to light certain verification challenges previously discussed by the authors.

When considering contexts as lists within the deductive framework, the deduction theorem enables the discharge of only the last assumption. However, the authors prefer to prove a generalization which allows any hypothesis to be discharged, presenting a novel induction-based method of proving the admissibility of an inference rule.

Their system emphasizes explicit propositional reasoning and implicit judgment reasoning, with the derivability relation involving a notion of truth within a possibility context. The implementation of this aspect requires an explicit rule (TP), which transforms true judgments into possibility judgments. This rule, integral to their system, is necessary for mechanizing derivability.

The authors outline two basic rules catering to different hypothesis types, allowing inference from any formula within a context. The necessity introduction rule encapsulates the concept of validity, whereas the necessity elimination rule serves as a substitution or cut rule. Judgments relating to possibility and necessity are characterized through the defined rules.

The paper presents new admissible rules developed in collaboration with the Coq proof assistantâ€”rules believed to be original contributions with the exception of one cited instance. These rules are refined versions of those detailed in the formal framework, tailored for both valid and true contexts.

A novel aspect discussed is a transfer principle between contexts, which acknowledges valid formulas as necessary truths. It is illustrated that a formula from a valid context can be treated as a necessary truth by removing it from the valid context and adding its necessity counterpart to the true hypotheses context.

The authors highlight the efficiency gained through translating modal reasoning to pure propositional reasoning when applicable. They illustrate this through examples where complex modal logic reasoning is replaced by simpler propositional arguments.

Lastly, the paper demonstrates the conversion of natural deduction proofs into axiomatic derivations, following a structured approach that ultimately results in a context solely comprising true assumptions, becoming more manageable within the HS4 axiomatic framework. This is accomplished by systematically applying induction on NS4 derivations.
