In this study, the authors examine the convex recoloring problem, which seeks the minimum number of vertex recolorings required to generate a coloring where every group of same-colored vertices forms a connected subgraph. While this problem has its roots in the analysis of phylogenetic trees, where it is recognized as NP-hard, this paper extends the investigation beyond trees to general graphs.

The paper introduces a heuristic called GRASP (Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure) to tackle the problem on general graphs, as existing research only provides exact algorithms without reported computational results. The developed GRASP heuristic is compared against an integer linear programming model established in prior literature, showing competitive results in terms of the number of vertices recolored and marked improvements in computational time.

The study presents a set of benchmark instances designed for the problem and outlines the paper's structure, which includes basic definitions, current methods, details of the proposed algorithm, experimental reports, and a discussion followed by conclusions and suggestions for future work.

The GRASP heuristic is an iterative process consisting of a greedy component for choosing candidates, a randomized element to avoid deterministic selection from the top candidates, and an adaptive component that allows previous iterations to influence current choices.

The primary steps of the heuristic involve recoloring vertices to create large uniform-colored components, simplifying those components, and employing a selection process to iteratively improve the coloring. The authors propose two alternative criteria to guide the process, named 'ratio' and 'union'.

Following the construction phase, a local search is used to fine-tune solutions by exploring the neighborhood of the current solution. This is achieved by considering reverting changes to original colors of recolored vertices, with two types of neighborhoods, simple and extended, which differ in their methods for identifying revertible vertices.
