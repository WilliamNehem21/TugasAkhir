The structure of this paper is organized in the following way: Section 2 introduces the nonlinear model applied to Kalman filtering. Section 3 describes a new enhanced version of truncated unscented Kalman filtering, detailing the algorithm's foundational theory and specific procedures. Section 4 provides the experimental results and their analysis.

In this study, the authors propose an adaptation of the Kalman filtering method that employs a sequential linear regression (SLR) approach within the context of a truncated unscented Kalman filter (TUKF) for processing nonlinear measurements. This technique is capable of handling scenarios where the measurement mapping is not one-to-one. By doing so, the algorithm broadens the practical usability of the filtering method. Through various simulations, it is demonstrated that the refined TUKF generally outperforms both the standard unscented Kalman filter (UKF) and the quadrature Kalman filter (QKF).
