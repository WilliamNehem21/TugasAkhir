This paper discusses the need for a universal mathematical framework to unify various theories that have been motivated by different ideas and described using different mathematical formalisms. Quantum mechanics, for instance, relies on the Hilbert space, while other theories use subsets of sets or entirely different formalisms. The goal of the paper is to introduce a framework in which all these theories can be expressed, making it easier to compare them, especially to scrutinize their physical differences with respect to properties like non-locality.

To investigate non-locality, the paper extends the proposed framework to include an abstract definition of a GHZ (Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger) state and the concept of correlations. The framework allows for the analysis of observables across various theories beyond standard quantum mechanics.

The paper references previous work that initiated the development of a general approach to physical theories, which was elaborated in other studies. These works laid the groundwork for using symmetric monoidal categories, providing physicist-friendly introductions and further developments in this method.

Specifically, the paper discusses stabilizer states and the operations associated with them, known as Clifford unitaries. These operations include CNOT gates and single-qubit Clifford unitaries, which can simulate all multi-qubit Clifford operations. The paper also emphasizes that the only allowed measurements are projective measurements on the Pauli observables.

The concrete definitions of stabilizer states and Spekkens' toy model are initially in terms of vector spaces and linear maps, as well as sets and relations. This categorical perspective, however, focuses only on the algebra of morphism composition, making the internal structure of the objects irrelevant. As a result, the paper states that these models are characterized by specific generating morphisms.

The paper outlines that certain results directly follow from this categorization, specifying the number of states and the eigenstate or unbiased nature of states with respect to observables for a given object, identified as "q" within the paper.

Despite some constraints on the observables and states, the paper argues that there is significant freedom to characterize the properties of observables and states on compound systems within these universally expressed quantum theories (referred to as MUQTs). These theories can substantially differ in their morphisms on "q." The paper notes that the stabilizer states and Spekkens' toy model are just two examples of many possible MUQTs.

Lastly, the paper suggests that any MUQT will allow for an argument analogous to one employed in the proof described, as long as the category has a basis structure, unbiased states, and scalars that behave like numbers or Booleans. This would be applicable to proofs involving GHZ correlations.
