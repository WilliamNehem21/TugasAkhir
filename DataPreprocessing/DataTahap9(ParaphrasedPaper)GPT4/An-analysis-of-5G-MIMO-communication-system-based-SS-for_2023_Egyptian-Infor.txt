This academic paper critically examines the traditional energy detection (ED) algorithm utilized in wireless communication systems. It was found that the ED algorithm's ability to detect signals is highly reliable when there is a large number of antennas, a long duration of the received primary user (PU) signal, and a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) greater than 15 dB. However, several limitations accompany this approach, such as increased costs with the addition of more antennas, restrictions based on the duration of the PU signal, and poor detection performance at SNRs below 15 dB. The research cited in the paper assumed a uniform duration and power for the received PU signal. The researchers observed that the ED algorithm performs well in a 5G-MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) communication system with 2 transmitting antennas and 4 receiving antennas, particularly at SNRs exceeding 15 dB using a QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying) mapper. Nevertheless, under other conditions, the detection capability was inadequate.

Furthermore, the paper delved into the threshold effect of the ED algorithm on the MIMO communication system by considering various SNR levels and assessing how they might influence the algorithm's performance, especially concerning detection accuracy and the probability of false alarms. The researchers found that while the ED algorithm has a better detection capacity compared to other methods at certain thresholds, its performance deteriorates significantly at SNRs below 5.6 dB.

The body of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the types of 5G signals being studied, including Filtered Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (F-OFDM), Filter Bank Multi-Carrier (FBMC), and Universal Filtered Multi-Carrier (UFMC) waveforms. Section 3 explains the process for sensing F-OFDM-MIMO, FBMC-MIMO, and UFMC-MIMO signals using a proposed spectrum sensing (SS) mathematical model based on a hybrid filter. The results of this research are presented and discussed in Section 4. Finally, the paper concludes in Section 5.

The paper discusses the importance of sample count (N) during spectrum sensing to achieve expected false alarm probability while detecting the PU signal. In situations with perfect knowledge of noise power, an essential parameter is determining the minimum number of samples required for the specified detection and false alarm probabilities, an expression that is independent of the detection threshold. Challenges in optimizing the minimum number of samples are highlighted, especially concerning the trade-off between increased sensing duration and its potentially negative impact on factors like battery life in IoT (Internet of Things) devices, given predetermined sensing periods in certain systems like IEEE 802.22.

In summary, the detection performance of the proposed MIMO sensing system for centralized cooperative users is found to be superior to that of a system designed for a single user, indicating a potential benefit to cooperative sensing approaches in MIMO systems.
