This academic paper delves into the reachability problem within the context of Petri nets—a mathematical modeling tool used for describing and analyzing the flow of information in a system. The paper asserts that it is possible to determine the reachability in Petri nets that do not have inhibitor arcs, as demonstrated in previous research. However, when Petri nets include at least two inhibitor arcs, reachability becomes undecidable. An unresolved issue at the time of the referenced work was the decidability of reachability in Petri nets when only a single inhibitor arc is present.

The paper presents an algorithm aimed at assessing reachability under certain conditions. In instances where a condition isn’t met, the algorithm seeks to simplify or 'reduce' the problem. Specifically, for the second condition, Presburger arithmetic—a decision procedure for a first-order theory—is employed to convert implicit quantity limitations signified by "witness places" into explicit restrictions for transitions. The third condition ensures that all quantity controls within the Petri net have no upper limit. The fourth condition checks that there are no limits to any of the places in the net.

To decide whether the fourth condition holds, a covering graph technique is used, which involves applying the algorithm recursively, akin to what is done for the first condition. In this covering graph, the current marking of a node is taken into account to constrain the semilinear set. Places that have limitations are eliminated at the expense of creating a more complex structure. This new, larger structure could potentially lose a property that was verified in an earlier recursive call due to the new restrictions imposed. Nevertheless, the paper posits that despite the reduction in size, one can re-establish the necessary property, and the algorithm will eventually reach a conclusion.
