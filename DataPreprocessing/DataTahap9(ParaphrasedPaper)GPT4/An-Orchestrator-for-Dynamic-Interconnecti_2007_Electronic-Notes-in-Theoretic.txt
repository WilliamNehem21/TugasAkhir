This academic paper uses a standard form of mathematical notation that is common to model-driven specification techniques such as VDM, Z, or B. However, the paper differentiates itself by opting for a point-free way of specifying, which helps in creating more streamlined descriptions and enhances the capacity for calculation. The mathematical framework upon which the paper is based is the category of sets along with set-theoretic functions and their composition characteristics.

At the core of the paper's method is a specialized form of a coordination connector known as the orchestrator, which is responsible for governing how different elements within the architectural framework interact with one another. This orchestrator serves as a mediating layer, providing a connection between the components and the more typical connectors, functioning as a facilitator for the dialogue between components and these connectors.
