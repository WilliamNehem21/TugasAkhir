This paper introduces an algorithm designed to enhance the contrast and detail of medical images while maintaining their inherent brightness. This enhancement is critical since the quality of medical images directly affects the accuracy of diagnoses. Traditional image acquisition can often result in low contrast and insufficient detail, leading to challenges in interpretation.

Building on the work of Bai et al., the proposed algorithm harnesses a multiscale top-hat transform by reconstruction to achieve its enhancements. Through the use of geodesic reconstruction, the process retains certain connected features within the image, yielding images with minimal distortion and improved contrast and detail without compromising the natural brightness.

The foundational concept of mathematical morphology underpins the method, which leverages mathematical operations based on the structural characteristics of the image elements. The operations employ nonlinear morphological operators that take two data sets: the original image and a structuring element that dictates the transformation.

The new technique, a modification of Bai et al.'s Multiscale Morphology for Contrast Enhancement (MMCE) for grayscale images, utilizes the top-hat transform combined with geodesic reconstruction to extract bright and dark features. This approach ensures the output images retain quality by considering connected operators within them.

An experimental evaluation was conducted using 100 medical images from a public database, comparing the proposed algorithm (GR-MMCE) against other existing methods using metrics for contrast, brightness preservation, and image distortion. A variety of medical images, including radiographs and ultrasounds, were assessed using algorithms HE, CLAHE, MMCE, and the proposed GR-MMCE. The implementation was carried out with MATLAB and ImageJ.

The results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm outperformed the others in preserving average brightness, enhancing contrast per the spatial detail (SD) metric, and scoring well in signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), pixel level (PL), and absolute mean brightness error (AMBE) metrics. This indicates that the algorithm not only reduces distortion but also appropriately heightens contrast without altering the average brightness of medical images.
