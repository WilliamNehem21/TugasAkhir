The paper discusses the concept of evaluating general formal expressions within the context of monad algebras. For example, simple arithmetic expressions like 3 + 2 can be evaluated to obtain a concrete number, 5. In a similar vein, monad algebras provide a framework wherein generalized expressions can be resolved to their respective elements within a certain object.

The paper includes a diagram that represents the initial three levels of the bar construction technique, which is detailed in another referenced work. It suggests that the weak pullback condition specified in Proposition 2.12 corresponds to a Kan extension condition, akin to the underlying principles of nerves of categories and, more broadly, quasicategories. In essence, the bar construction relates to these concepts.

Furthermore, when examining the composition of '1-simplices' defined in Proposition 2.12's proof, it results in a '2-simplex' that serves as a Kan extension of an 'inner horn'. This extension always exists in the context of weakly Cartesian conditions and is uniquely determined when the conditions are strictly Cartesian. When these unique fillers are present, the resulting simplicial set effectively becomes the nerve of a category.

The paper also explores the structure of the Kantorovich monad algebras. These algebras are essentially complete metric spaces that have an affinity for closed convex combinations, like those found in vector spaces. Ideal candidates that exemplify these features are closed convex subsets of Banach spacesâ€”they not only constitute complete metric spaces but are also inherently convex. The study cites previous work to assert that in the category of complete metric spaces, 'p-algebras' are essentially these closed convex subsets within Banach spaces, characterized up to isomorphism, with integral operations providing the structure.

Lastly, the authors express their gratitude to the participants of the Applied Category Theory 2019 school, as well as colleagues and institutions that contributed to their discussion and research, noting that much of the paper was a product of their time spent at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences, which they acknowledge for its stimulating research environment.
