Recent research advancements lose their general applicability when dealing with matching constraints in calculations that yield multiple solutionsâ€”such scenarios with various potential substitutions pose problems, as there is currently no fully satisfactory method to rank these substitutions in any order. Consequently, it becomes necessary to represent groups of terms using sets or a structure that is both associative and commutary in nature.

In the pursuit of proving the Church-Rosser property in section 5, an upcoming definition and lemma play a pivotal role. They encapsulate the concept that if a given multiplicative relationship on simple terms adheres to the multi-diamond condition (or if its single-item extension follows the diamond condition), then this characteristic also applies to the multiplicative extension of the relationship.
