This academic paper discusses advancements in cryptography and steganography, which are techniques used to secure communications by obscuring the information being sent. Cryptography converts readable data (plaintext) into an unreadable format (ciphertext), protecting the contents during storage or transmission, particularly across vulnerable networks such as the internet. Steganography involves concealing a secret message within another, seemingly innocuous message, so that only the intended recipient knows of the hidden message's existence.

In this paper, the authors concentrate on enhancing the cryptographic component within a steganography approach that uses a secret key. Building upon their previous work that integrated text steganography with AES-HMAC cryptography, they have introduced a novel method aimed at improving cryptographic strength. Cryptographic strength is gauged by the time and effort required to revert ciphertext back to plaintext. Their approach involves modifying the ciphertext using a shifting algorithm, which rearranges the characters according to a key value, resulting in a robust cryptographic system that is challenging to decode without the correct tools.

The hybrid approach discussed in the paper builds on a strategy that the authors previously developed, relying on hybrid cryptography based on the AES-HMAC method. HMAC, or keyed-hash message authentication code, is a technique used to combine a message authentication code (MAC) with a hash function (in this case, SHA-256) using a secret cryptographic key. AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) with a 256-bit key length is also utilized. In this work, the authors propose a method that uses HMAC for encryption, which is then followed by applying the shifting algorithm to the HMAC-generated ciphertext.

Once the ciphertext is produced, it is processed through the shifting algorithm, which then rearranges the text to create a shifted cipher. This newly formed cipher is then incorporated into the steganographic component of the system.

The paper concludes by highlighting several key findings, emphasizing that the proposed method promises to enhance data security beyond what is achievable with standard encryption techniques.
