In recent research, an approach was taken to directly use raw sensor data for gesture identification by applying machine learning algorithms. This method, employing techniques such as deep learning, k-nearest neighbors, decision trees, and support vector machines, has been shown to be rapid and potentially more efficient given sufficient data quantities. Nevertheless, the challenge lies in the fact that not all sensor-derived features are pertinent, and sifting through them to identify the most informative ones is difficult. Feature selection technologies have been emphasized as a way to refine the dataset for optimized outcomes.

Metaheuristic algorithms, which have gained popularity over the past few decades, are recognized for their capacity to solve complex optimization problems by taking advantage of natural search mechanisms and adaptability. These algorithms have been notably effective in overcoming obstacles presented by intricate search spaces and non-linear objectives in various real-world situations.

The paper also introduces a metaheuristic algorithm-based strategy aimed at reducing data dimensionality. A deep neural network (DNN) incorporates this algorithm for feature selection and is later harnessed for gesture classification. Comparison between this selected algorithm and traditional ones demonstrates superior performance.

Following sections of the paper discuss related works, dataset generation and preprocessing, details of the proposed feature selection and classification techniques, and the empirical results and discussion.

The Leap Motion Controller (LMC) data, taken under consistent lighting conditions and at varying distances, was subjected to an initial variance-based preprocessing. The features were then narrowed down and normalized to aid in model performance and convergence speed. Hardware included an HP Core i3-10th generation CPU, with the LMC integrated via LeapSDK v2.0 and Python 2.7, while data analysis was conducted in Python 3.

The essence of feature selection is to refine the preliminary dataset, enhancing its quality for various machine learning tasks. It offers numerous benefits such as better performance, interpretability, reduced computational demands, and increased accuracy. The Spotted Hyena-based Chimp Optimization Algorithm (SSC) emerged as an effective metaheuristic approach in this study's context of dimensionality reduction in gesture recognition.

The DNN model consisted of an input layer, three hidden layers, and an output layer. Adequate training of the network is crucial to avoid overfitting or underfitting. Metaheuristic algorithms have proven beneficial for training over traditional methods, showcasing their capability to handle complexities in optimization problems.

The SSC algorithm displayed excellent performance in feature selection and in training the DNN model for gesture classification, achieving a remarkable accuracy rate of 98.7%. The study demonstrated SSC's dominance over previously used algorithms such as Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and the Sine-Cosine Algorithm (SCA).
