In this paper, the authors introduce a behavioral extension to the concept of interfaces for component-based systems, aiming to analyze the correctness properties of both closed (static) and open (dynamic) component-based systems uniformly. Their approach focuses on local analysis of finite interaction fragments, which models mobility and coordination, and introduces a semi-automatic technique to verify security properties of protocols by reducing them to correctness verification in these systems.

They define interaction patterns, which specify the behavior of components through the communications they can engage in and the communication channels offered to the environment. The authors stress that interaction patterns are finite. An abstraction called context, which is a multiset of connected components, is used to model the composition environment. In this model, synchronous input and output actions on channels facilitate data transfer, and component mobility is supported, reflecting dynamic system behaviors.

The system allows for finite behavioral fragments of individual components to be composed within a context, through connections, to observe the resulting system behavior. Differing scenarios of closed and open systems require distinct correctness properties formulations.

The paper introduces the concept of an open context's feasibility, dependent on the existence of an interaction pattern that, upon joining the context, results in a closed and correct system. This feasibility is a verification invariant for open systems. The authors illustrate this with an example of a feasible context and the inability of a server component that cannot handle certain events to join this context.

Security of a protocol is then discussed in terms of data integrity, with encryption and decryption being part of the communication actions. The authors provide an example protocol to clarify how security is handled in their model.

The authors also review related work on security protocol analysis and foundational models for component composition. They highlight their contribution, which provides formal mechanisms to locally and uniformly reason about both composition and security in open systems.

Finally, the paper outlines ongoing work to extend the framework to multiple sessions and authentication protocols, generalizing the notion of magical instances to express security properties as logic formulae. The authors plan to further validate their methodology through its application in additional case studies.
