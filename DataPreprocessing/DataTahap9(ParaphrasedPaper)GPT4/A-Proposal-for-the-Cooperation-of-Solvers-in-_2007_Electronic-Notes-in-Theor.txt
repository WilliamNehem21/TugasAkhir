The CLP (Constraint Logic Programming) framework, which originated from the influential work of Jaffar and Lassez, integrates constraint programming (CP) with logic programming (LP) and has demonstrated significant utility in CP tasks. Building upon this, efforts have been made since 1991 to incorporate a functional programming (FP) aspect, resulting in the creation of CFLP (Constraint Functional Logic Programming) systems. These systems seek to meld the strengths of CP, the advantages of higher-order and lazy evaluation in FP, and the declarative nature of LP into a highly expressive programming paradigm.
