This research paper presents a calibration method called Model Output Calibration (MOC) and its application to enhancing weather forecasts produced by the ETA 15km model at CPTEC/INPE. The ETA model is a regional tool used for numerical weather prediction. The paper demonstrates that statistical correction using MOC improved the accuracy of temperature and relative humidity forecasts. These results are considered beneficial for simulation models of crops and diseases which rely on weather forecast data as input.

The paper delves into the features and workings of MOC, and its successful application in correcting forecasts from the ETA model. Statistical corrections applied to temperature and relative humidity data showed favorable outcomes. The paper concludes with a discussion of the research findings and potential directions for future work based on the results achieved.

The motivation behind this study emerges from the observation that, although forecasting methods have grown increasingly sophisticated, the outputs can still be flawed due to their coarse representations of landscapes and physical processes. To mitigate these errors, in addition to using grid point mesoscale models in certain regions, statistical calibration methods have been employed.

Calibration involves identifying and correcting issues in a forecast model. It differs from validation as it is based on different parameter selections which are technical and vary by method. MOC, developed by Mao et al. in 1998, is one such method that uses multivariate linear regression with a shorter training period of forecast and observation data, compared to techniques like Model Output Statistics (MOS) and Perfect Prog Method (PPM).

The paper includes an analysis of MOC's application at various Brazilian locations involved in an energy forecasting improvement project in collaboration with PPGCA/UPF and CPTEC/INPE. The study focused on areas with significant energy demands, like agriculture and irrigation, analyzing datasets from 36 locations across Brazil.

The computing system developed for this project runs on Linux, with scripts and programs written in Linux shell and the Fortran programming language. Statistical analyses were performed using the R language.

Results showed that the ETA model's temperature forecasts were generally within 2Â°C of observations but tended to underestimate morning temperatures. Relative humidity forecasts were typically overestimated at night and underestimated during the day. The largest discrepancies in temperature were found at stations where the model's grid points were far from the observational data points. The inconsistency of averaging model grid data against specific observational measurements was noted as a source of error.
