The paper presents a study on the role of completely positive (CP) maps in the framework of first-order quantum computation. The authors provide a categorical framework to understand CP maps, advocating their natural relationship with positive maps. They explore various representations of quantum computation, including affine maps between positive elements' cones, effect algebras' morphisms, and affine mappings on convex state sets. Specifically, they turn to convex directed-complete partial orders (dcpos) to build a quantum domain theory. This theory incorporates key quantum computing aspects like tensor products and state lifting, enhancing conventional models.

Although some existing models use structures like convex sets, domains, and effect algebras to represent quantum computations, they're typically limited to positive, rather than CP maps. The authors describe a generalized approach to extend these structural representations to CP maps through the use of a functor—a mathematical concept that essentially allows for the translation of objects and morphisms (arrows) from one category to another in a way that preserves the categorical structure.

Drawing an analogy with classical domain theory, the paper references two categories of significance: the category of dcpos with Scott-continuous functions (Predom) and another of pointed dcpos (with a least element) alongside strict Scott-continuous functions (Dom!) which respect the least element. They highlight the concept of lifting—a process of adding a bottom element to a dcpo, framed as the left adjoint to a 'forgetful' functor that disregards this added structure. This abstract approach aims to provide insights into the algebraic and categorical underpinnings of quantum computation, offering a broader and more robust theoretical framework for understanding its processes.
