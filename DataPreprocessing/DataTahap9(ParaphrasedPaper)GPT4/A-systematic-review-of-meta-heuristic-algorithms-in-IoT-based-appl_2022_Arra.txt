The rapid advancement of technologies such as big data analytics, blockchain, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning has propelled the widespread adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT-based systems enable smart and automated decision-making, simplifying human tasks and improving life's efficiency. Meta-heuristic algorithms, known for their decentralized and self-organizing nature, have gained prominence in addressing complex problems through collective intelligence. This paper offers a thorough review of meta-heuristic algorithms and their application in various IoT challenges. Existing meta-heuristic algorithms are classified broadly, and their significant applications in IoT systems are highlighted. The paper poses current research questions to generate new avenues for exploration and concludes with recent IoT trends and potential future directions. The aim is to guide researchers interested in meta-heuristic algorithms and IoT systems.

Physical-based methods, which derive inspiration from physical phenomena like the heating and cooling of materials, are covered, citing specific algorithms such as simulated annealing and its ability to find optimal solutions without a predetermined starting strategy. Such methods have proven effective in real-world problem-solving.

The paper also examines the influence of new technologies on urban development, particularly in smart cities of developing countries. Ensuring reliability, security, efficiency, and scalability within these cities remains difficult, with swarm intelligence posited as a promising solution that leverages collective behavior and self-organization. Various algorithms have been proposed to aid infrastructure development, mitigating natural disasters and accelerating damage assessment and solution provision.

Meta-heuristic techniques have become indispensable for solving nonlinear and computationally demanding optimization issues prevalent across multiple domains. Swarm intelligence, when combined with IoT, can resolve the intricacies involved in IoT systems, which encompass smart objects and decentralized algorithms. Such algorithms include artificial bee colony, ant colony optimization, and social spider optimization, each having applications that streamline IoT processes.

Furthermore, the paper analyzes the integration of techniques and technologies from assorted domains to design meta-heuristic algorithms, stressing the importance of adopting design patterns in an abstract manner for algorithm creation.

Despite the potential of combining meta-heuristics with IoT, challenges persist, such as the scarcity of professional sensors, particularly in agriculture, and inadequate networking communication, especially in rural areas, leading to unreliable data transfer. These obstacles necessitate the development of viable systems to evaluate performance in diverse scenarios.

Lastly, it's noted that no single organizational structure can currently manage dynamic and high-dimensional data effectively. During data transfers, security risks like data tampering and wiretapping pose threats to system integrity. Although some optimization techniques have been devised to address these challenges, data authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality remain essential for optimal data acquisition and transfer. The paper remarks that capital investment hurdles could impede industry growth in sectors mentioned throughout the literature.
