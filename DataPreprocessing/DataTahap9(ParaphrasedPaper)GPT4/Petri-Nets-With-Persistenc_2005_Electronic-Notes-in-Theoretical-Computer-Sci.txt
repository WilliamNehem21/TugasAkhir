This paper discusses the extension of Petri nets—a conventional framework for modeling concurrent and distributed computations—to incorporate persistent conditions. Petri nets with persistent conditions are useful for simulating unreliable networks where communication follows a specific security protocol. In this enhancement, the authors describe a technique to unfold the persistent conditions into a standard Petri net and establish certain conditions under which this unfolded net reflects the same finite behaviors as the original net with persistence.

Additionally, the paper offers a specialized definition of general Petri nets for cases where conditions are either present or absent (multiplicities of 0 or 1, respectively), effectively treating markings as subsets of conditions, with each condition having a capacity of one.

The study also touches upon coloured Petri nets, a compact version of Petri nets introduced by Jensen and further developed by Winskel. In this context, it's discussed that coloured nets could be simplified by considering only the sets (multiplicities of 0 or 1) instead of multisets for the purposes of the paper.

The concept of coloured nets is articulated using the notions of places (conditions) and transitions (events), which are represented at a more abstract level. Colors help distinguish different sets of conditions and events, tying a specific color to a place (condition) or a transition (event).

The modified Petri nets that include persistent conditions consist of events and conditions interconnected by maps that define the preconditions and postconditions of an event. Among these conditions are persistent conditions, which form a distinct subset. When a net has persistent conditions, a marking is simply a subset of conditions, which may include some persistent ones.

The paper concludes that the method for unfolding nets with persistent conditions is correct if the resulting net's execution outcomes are essentially the same as the original net's. This unfolding process has limitations, as not all nets with persistent conditions can be unfolded accurately using the outlined method. Specifically, it's not suitable for nets with events that have persistent postconditions occurring more than once in a single execution sequence. Finally, the authors note the distinction between basic nets, where an event either occurs or doesn't, and nets with persistent conditions where an event can occur multiple times with different multiplicities, as demonstrated with an example net that allows an event to happen repeatedly.
