The academic paper discusses the significance of producing high-quality software and the Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) approach, in which high-quality models are essential for success. Patterns and pattern languages are highlighted as tools to assist designers in MDE by providing a common vocabulary to effectively communicate their ideas.

The paper outlines the importance of tool assistance in managing model quality, given the limitations of manual inspection. It emphasizes that choosing the wrong pattern or misapplying one could lead to a poorly designed system. The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is mentioned as a formalism for checking model syntax through well-formedness rules (WFRs) and the Object Constraint Language (OCL) but acknowledges that semantic and aesthetic validation relies on subjective domain knowledge, with Computer-Aided Software Engineering (CASE) tools aiding in the assessment.

The authors explore the Software Critique and Repair (SCR) process as a mechanism for identifying and resolving issues with pattern application within designs. They demonstrate the integration of SCR within the open-source UML tool, ArgoUML, and how the tool helps designers fix problems and improve model consistency through predefined critics for six Enterprise Architectures and Application (EAA) patterns.

The paper is structured in sections: an introduction to pattern languages and EAA patterns, a description of the SCR process for pattern verification, a case study of SCR in ArgoUML, a review of related work, and finally a conclusion and future work.

In terms of patterns, EAA focuses on a three-tiered architecture: presentation, domain, and data source layers. The SCR process, which consists of verifying the sign (indication of a pattern), criteria (quality checks), and repair steps, emphasizes the importance of automated support within integrated development environments (IDEs) to promote pattern usage accuracy.

Finally, the paper reviews other works in model quality assessment and expresses the ambition to further develop the SCR process, with goals such as creating a comprehensive pattern profile and tools that guide users in selecting appropriate patterns, enhancing model verification, and facilitating problem resolution.
