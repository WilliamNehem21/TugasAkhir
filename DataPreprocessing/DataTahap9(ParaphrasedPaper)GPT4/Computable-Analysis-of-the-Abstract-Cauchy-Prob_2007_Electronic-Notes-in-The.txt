The paper discusses the computational relationship between a semigroup \( w(t) \) and its corresponding infinitesimal generator \( A \) concerning the solution of a certain equation \( u(t)= w(t)x \). The main focus of the paper is identifying the necessary information about \( A \) required to compute \( w(t) \) and the details needed about \( w(t) \) to infer aspects of \( A \).

The structure of the paper is as follows:

1. Introduction to the problem involving the computation of semigroups \( w(t) \) and the relationship with the infinitesimal generator \( A \).
2. A brief overview of essential concepts and facts regarding \( C_0 \) semigroups of bounded linear operators in Banach spaces, providing the mathematical framework for the study.
3. Description of the computational model and relevant definitions that will be used in the investigations.
4. Demonstration of the method to compute a uniformly continuous semigroup \( w(t) \) given its bounded linear infinitesimal generator \( A \), and conversely, how to determine \( A \) from \( w(t) \).
