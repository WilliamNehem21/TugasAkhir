The paper presents a comprehensive investigation into the surge of cyber-attacks leveraging the COVID-19 pandemic as a disguise. A chronology of significant cyber-attacks associated with COVID-19 themes is documented, correlating with the spread of the virus, revealing an average occurrence of four notable cyber-attack incidents per month. The study identifies common social engineering techniques such as malicious domains, phishing schemes, scams, email forgery, and fake mobile applications. Ransomware, trojans, and bots were the primary tools used to infiltrate systems.

This research is pioneering in examining COVID-19's impact on cybersecurity issues, charting a timeline of related cyber-attacks, discussing the consequences, and recommending countermeasures to prevent future attacks. They also propose a novel detection system based on fuzzy logic and data mining to identify malicious URLs and phishing attempts related to COVID-19.

The paper is organized into seven sections, with section 2 critiquing contemporary cybersecurity methods, section 3 detailing the attack timeline and cybersecurity changes due to COVID-19, section 4 suggesting countermeasures, section 5 outlining the detection system, section 6 evaluating the system's performance, and section 7 concluding and proposing future research directions.

The pandemic's exploitation by cybercriminals is discussed, emphasizing their use of COVID-related lures. It underscores the importance of user awareness to prevent these attacks and stresses the necessity for security measures like network scanning by professionals and addressing the cybersecurity skills gap.

The detection system introduced by the authors uses fuzzy logic, chosen for its ability to handle uncertainty and imprecise information in distinguishing between legitimate and phishing URLs. They highlight the significance of minimizing false negatives to ensure users' access to credible COVID-19 information.

The proposed fuzzy logic-based system is tested against a dataset comprising both legal and malicious COVID-19 related domains, demonstrating a detection accuracy of 98.19%, a false positive rate of 1.01%, and a false negative rate of 2.76%, indicating its effectiveness in allowing access to essential information while blocking harmful content.
