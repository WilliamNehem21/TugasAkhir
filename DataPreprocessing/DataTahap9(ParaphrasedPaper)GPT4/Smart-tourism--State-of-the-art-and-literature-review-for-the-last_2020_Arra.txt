The tourism industry is recognized as a significant contributor to the global economy and the socio-economic development of various countries. With consistent growth demonstrated by an increase in tourist arrivals from 528 million in 2005 to 1.19 billion in 2015, and a projection of 1.8 billion by 2030, its influence is undeniable. The industry accounted for a direct economic impact of about $2.57 trillion in 2017 and supported millions of jobs worldwide. Recognizing the potential benefits of tourism, there is a drive to enhance the attractiveness of destinations for both less-traveled and popular locations.

In the realm of academia, developing and refining theory is vital yet challenging. Theories offer a framework to research, identifying important factors, their interrelations, and practical applications. This is true for smart tourism research as well, where scholars aim to provide theoretical clarity.

This literature review encompasses various systems with context-aware capabilities, such as the "Madrid Live" and "HotCity" recommender systems, which base their services on user context for providing relevant recommendations. It also discusses proposals for smart tourism system structures that combine data from both humans and sensors, advanced data processing platforms, and services that adjust to tourists' preferences.

Businesses in tourism are encouraged to leverage smart technologies to enhance customer experiences and gain competitive advantage. For instance, Neuhoffer et al.'s research illustrates how mobile technologies can provide personalized hospitality experiences, featuring a case study of a hotel using a dynamic personalization platform between guests and staff.

To improve user experience with augmented reality (AR), scholarly attempts have been made to address usability issues, such as data overload. One such attempt is the iterative development of an AR tourism application called "TOARIST," which employs user-centric design.

Image-based localization is a burgeoning area in AR and smart tourism, where methods are developed to determine the location and orientation from which an image was captured. These methods have wide applications and are subject to ongoing research to enhance the speed and performance of AR and real-time navigation, which in turn support smart tourism development.

Heritage, encompassing both cultural (traditions, history, language, folklore) and natural elements, is closely linked to tourism. Cultural heritage, in particular, is a catalyst for economic and social transformation, prompting numerous cultural regeneration policies.

Despite numerous research efforts in smart tourism over the past six years, there remain substantial challenges. Evaluation of these systems with actual tourists is limited. The sector's complexity lies in its multi-disciplinary nature, involving various devices for sensing, data exchange, and connectivity. Successful integration of these heterogeneous elements and adapting to rapidly changing technology and user behavior are critical for the success and sustainability of smart tourism systems.
