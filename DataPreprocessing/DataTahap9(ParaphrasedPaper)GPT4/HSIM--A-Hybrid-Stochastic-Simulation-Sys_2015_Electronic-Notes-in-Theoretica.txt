The lac operon repressor in E. coli demonstrates the significance of local concentration, as its small number in cells, about ten copies, still has a noticeable effect due to its high concentration near its DNA binding sites. The repressor's mechanism and the spacing of binding sites on the DNA enable cooperative effects that are self-reinforcing.

By observing a particle undergoing Brownian motion for a time interval, its average displacement vector is zero, indicating no directional preference in its movement due to random forces. Diffusion is a result of many molecules' independent motions and is captured by the diffusion constant, which depends on particle size, shape, and fluid properties.

Unimolecular reactions involve a single molecule transitioning among states, such as protein conformations or complex dissociations. Entity-centered stochastic simulators model these with specific triggering probabilities. Bimolecular reactions require collision and sufficient energy between reacting molecules, with collision frequency proportional to reactant concentrations according to the mass action law.

Large aggregates can hinder diffusion and create abnormal local concentrations that influence system behavior. Simulators considering individual entities can capture these effects, unlike homogeneous methods that assume uniform mixing.

HSim is a simulation tool for bacterial and small eukaryotic cells' modeling, featuring compartments and subcompartments customizable to various shapes, useful for studying organisms like bacteria or yeast.

Biomolecules are represented in nanometer scales, with HSim maintaining real-time information on molecule type, position, size, and links to other molecules by applying iteration-based rules which mimic chemical reactions.

Reaction probabilities account for collision energy and correspond to reaction kinetics. To calculate average collisions, one multiplies the number of non-entity molecules by the volume ratio displaced by an entity.

In a simulation model, species A and B diffuse in a micrometer-cubed compartment, transforming into short-lived species C with set probabilities, demonstrating a reaction degrading A and B pairs.

Synechococcus elongatus, a gram-negative, photosynthetic cyanobacterium, has a circadian clock regulated by proteins whose phosphorylation oscillates with a 24-hour cycle, influenced by allosteric transitions and interplay between its constituent proteins.

The simulation of actin polymerization considers the reversible nature of polymer formation from actin monomers, dependent on kinetics and not accounting for ATP to ADP energy conversion in a simplified model.

HSim's hybrid simulation integrates an entity-centered system and an approximate stochastic simulation algorithm, highlighting the benefits of spatial localization consideration and an efficient method for evolving system reactions based on rules.
