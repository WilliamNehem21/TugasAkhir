Wireless sensor nodes, which are typically comprised of computational and communication modules, a power source, and a sensing system, offer an advantage in that they do not require cumbersome and extensive cabling. Both wired and wireless methods are widely adopted for the purposes of monitoring and control. In the future, it is projected that wireless sensor networks and mobile communications will become an essential aspect of daily life, largely due to their ease of deployment, versatility, and affordability.
