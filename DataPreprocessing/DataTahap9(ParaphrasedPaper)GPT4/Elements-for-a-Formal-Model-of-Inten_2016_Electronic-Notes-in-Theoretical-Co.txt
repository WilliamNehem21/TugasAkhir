This paper outlines a proposition for a computational model aimed at formalizing intentionally driven actions and systems. Commencing with an overview of intentionality, it sets the context for the proposed theoretical framework. The paper navigates through the core types of intentional activities, establishes the concepts of intentional processes and systems, and proposes the basics of the formal structure for such systems.

In the structure of the paper, Section 2 revisits foundational theories of intentional acts and processes. Section 3 introduces the formal notion of an intentional system as the groundwork for modeling intentional processes. Section 4 showcases a straightforward case study, demonstrating the practical application of the theory. The concluding section (Section 5) contemplates on other related works and broader matters.

The discussion in the paper is distilled by considering intentional processes as singular intentional acts within discrete, sequentially ordered time. It omits the intricate details of how to precisely determine if a statement accurately describes an object or if an object (or a statement) satisfies a specific type criterion. These finer aspects are reserved for further debate in Section 5.

In comparing the semantic breadth tackled by the new perspective offered by the paper with that of traditional formal language systems, both logical and computational, the paper reflects on different semantic approaches. While logical semantics simplify the range of meaning compared to Husserl's comprehensive semantics by focusing on language-related eidetic elements through connotations and denotations, empiricist semantics aims to pair language strictly with its object relations, a view Husserl critiqued. The paper ultimately discusses the nexus between the newly introduced formal model for intentional systems and the conventional semantic models used for formal languages.
