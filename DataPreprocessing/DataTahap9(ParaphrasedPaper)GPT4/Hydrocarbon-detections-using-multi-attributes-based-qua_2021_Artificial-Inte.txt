This study explores a new approach for detecting hydrocarbon using a combination of multiple seismic data attributes and advanced quantum neural network techniques. In areas with tight sandstone gas reservoirs, such as the Sichuan Basin in China, traditional detection methods often struggle due to the reservoir's characteristics like strong heterogeneity, low porosity and permeability, and the small physical property differences between sandstone and mudstone. Additionally, some sand deposits are not only thin but also hard to identify, making the seismic responses weak and difficult to interpret.

To tackle these challenges, the researchers propose a multi-attributes based quantum neural network strategy. The selected attributes include local wave decomposition-based seismic attenuation characteristics, relative wave impedance features, and data clustering results from prestack seismic data, which collectively enhance the sensitivity to the weak responses associated with gas saturation in the reservoir.

Data clustering can provide insights into sedimentary facies, lithological assemblages, bedding patterns, and sedimentary features in seismic sections. In contrast, local wave decomposition focuses on the attenuation characteristics related to hydrocarbon content, while relative wave impedance highlights changes in lithology.

The researchers employ a combination of methods, like the CEEMD-based (Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition) attenuation gradient estimation and wavelet-based cepstrum decomposition, to process the local wave decomposition-based seismic attenuation characteristics. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is then used to refine these features and combine them with a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)-assisted Quantum Gravitational Search Neural Network (QGSNN) to analyze the seismic data from the gas reservoir.

The proposed approach demonstrates superior ability in detecting weak seismic response features tied to gas saturation, outperforming traditional Back Propagation (BP) methods and conventional interpretation techniques. The findings hold promise as an aid for hydrocarbon detection in challenging reservoirs like the one studied in the Sichuan Basin.
