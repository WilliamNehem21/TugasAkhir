To annotate chemical compounds based on the stage of their clinical trials, the study utilized data from ChEMBL. This database records whether a compound has been a clinical candidate and, if so, the specific phase it's in: '0' for preclinical research, '1-3' for phases I-III clinical trials, and '4' for compounds approved by the FDA and/or EMA. The authors used ChEMBL to track compound progression from preclinical to clinical stages within the drug development process, including associated patents.

The researchers then conducted a retrospective analysis of patent data for various diseases to identify leading organizations in drug R&D. They also looked at case studies of specific targets based on biological networks and analyzed their patenting trends. Furthermore, they demonstrated how patents help in discovering drug repurposing opportunities.

They provided an overview of patent data for each disease, including the nature of patenting (pharmacological or formulation-related) and the status of patents (approved or pending). They also compared the contributions of major pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions to drug R&D, categorized patent ownership, and assessed historical patenting activities.

The study emphasized the importance of understanding the mode of action (MOA) of drugs and explored the prioritization of targets in patent literature over the years. Additionally, they examined the role of patents in revealing new uses for drugs, such as repurposing, based on successful clinical trial results or emerging scientific findings.

For instance, they discussed drugs like sotorasib, which targets specific KRAS mutations and has potential in cancer therapy, and its possible repurposing for treating other conditions with related genetic abnormalities.

The research concluded that patent analyses provide valuable insight into the landscape of small molecule drug research, complementing scientific literature and offering competitive intelligence for pharmaceutical R&D. The authors suggested that monitoring patent activities from public sources could inform target selection strategies within specific therapeutic areas. Their methodological approach highlights the role of patent data in decision-making for future drug development.
