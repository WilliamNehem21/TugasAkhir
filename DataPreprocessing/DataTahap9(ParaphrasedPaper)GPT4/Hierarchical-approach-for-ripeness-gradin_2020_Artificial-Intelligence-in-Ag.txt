Significant research has been conducted on the use of automation to grade and sort mangoes based on their external appearance, including characteristics such as shape, size, color, weight, and defects. Notable work on mango classification utilizing shape metrics and wavelet descriptors is presented by Khoje and Shrikant (2012). In subsequent studies, the same authors explored the use of feedforward neural networks and support vector machines for classification based on size (Khoje and Shrikant, 2013). Other research, such as that by Musale and Pradeep (2014) and Pauly and Deepa (2015), has examined the identification of external defects on mangoes using texture analysis.

Beyond these attributes, ripeness has been considered a crucial factor for classifying mangoes. During ripening, observable changes in the mango's skin color and texture occur regardless of the ripening method. In this research, color features were initially used to represent the different stages of ripeness. To capture the color data in a mango's segmented region, color information was extracted from multiple color spaces, including RGB, L*a*b, HSV, CMY, and YCbCr. For each color space, four features were extracted, such as the individual color channels in the RGB space and a combined feature.

The study evaluated features from all color spaces across various levels of a proposed hierarchical classification approach. For each level, the performance of classifiers was assessed to determine the best classifier and the most informative color feature from the corresponding color space. The dataset was split into training (T1%) and testing (T2%) sets at each classification level. Assume that P classifiers were used at each level. The study involved L iterations, selecting training and testing samples randomly.

Results suggest the hierarchical method is effective for grading the ripeness of mangoes, particularly highlighting the influence of features from the L*a*b color space in distinguishing four ripeness classes of the Alphonso mango variety. Compared to a one-step multiclass classification, the layered approach showed enhanced performance. Of the six classifiers studied, combinations that paired support vector machines (SVM) and simple threshold classifiers with various color features yielded the most promising outcomes. This research, focused on post-harvest management of the Alphonso mango, fortifies the case for expanding studies to include other varieties and additional factors like storage time, temperature, and moisture. The classification method proposed here could be applied in offline settings for post-harvest mango management.
