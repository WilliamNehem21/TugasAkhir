The academic paper emphasizes the need for reduced computational time in medical image denoising, focusing on methods that expedite processing. It cites Yan et al.'s contribution, which uses a clustering-based preclassification approach for speed enhancement while retaining all pixels during weight calculation. Specifically, the K-means clustering algorithm is employed, where the number of clusters (k) is determined either through visual assessment or by evaluating peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) metrics. In K-means clustering, image patches are split into distinct groups with each pixel assigned to only one cluster, unlike fuzzy clustering where pixels can belong to multiple clusters.

The paper introduces an innovative Non-Local Means (NLM) framework designed to remove speckle noise from breast ultrasound images. The enhancement of NLM performance is achieved through two key developments: an automated clustering-based preclassification using gap statistics and a new similarity metric based on rotationally invariant moment distances. Comparative results demonstrate that this new method outperforms existing NLM-based techniques in quantitative assessments. The combination of noise resilience and low processing times renders this newly proposed filter suitable for integration into ultrasound-based computer-aided breast cancer diagnosis systems.
