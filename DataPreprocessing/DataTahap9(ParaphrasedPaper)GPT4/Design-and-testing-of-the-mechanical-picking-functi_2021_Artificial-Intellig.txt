The support frame houses a gear train with a transmission ratio of 1:2. The manipulator's reciprocating mechanism is linked at one end to the manipulator itself, and at the other end to both the gear train and the transmission case's output shaft. During operation, the transmission case actuates a crank, causing the manipulator to execute a back-and-forth motion for picking up plug seedlings and placing them down.

In the transplanting experiment, 128 seedlings were transplanted in a single line, but the initial 8 were discarded, leaving 120 to be assessed. The evaluation involved counting occurrences of missed transplants, replants, seedlings that lodged, were exposed, buried, or damaged. Based on these observations, key performance metrics were determined, which included the coefficient of variation (CV) for plant spacing, rates of missed transplanting, and the percentage of plants that met standards for both upright positioning and proper planting depth.
