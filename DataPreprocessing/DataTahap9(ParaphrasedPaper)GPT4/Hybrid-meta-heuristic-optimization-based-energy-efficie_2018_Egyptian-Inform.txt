Recently, energy efficiency has emerged as a critical concern in the field of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Since these networks are reliant on battery power, their sensors inevitably reach the end of their operational life. Consequently, it has become increasingly vital to enhance the process of transmitting data in an energy-conscious manner to prolong the lifespan of the sensor devices. One proposed solution is to employ both clustering and tree-based data gathering techniques to boost the longevity of WSNs. The proposed protocol integrates Hybrid Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to achieve energy-efficient clustering. This system commences with the formation of clusters considering the remaining energy levels before implementing the combined ACO-PSO strategy to further refine inter-cluster data collection. Through comprehensive testing, this protocol has shown to significantly extend the network lifespan when compared to other methods.

Additional experiments explored using the simulated annealing technique to shape the topology by targeting maximized network coverage and lifespan of WSNs. Nayak and Vathasavai have employed type-2 fuzzy logic in WSNs to optimize cluster head (CH) selection, while Ouchitachen and colleagues have developed an Improved Multiobjective Weighted Clustering Algorithm (IMOWCA) for choosing CHs, using residual energy to select optimal nodes for communication with the base station. The base station genetic algorithm has also been applied to balance energy distribution among different clusters.

Elshrkawey and team highlighted deficiencies in the LEACH protocol such as the subpar selection of CHs, the creation of unbalanced clusters, and continuous data transmission updates. They improved CH election through threshold values, scheduled times for sensor nodes to send updated data, and modified TDMA scheduling to break the steady phase. Meanwhile, Rani and associates have introduced the E-CBCCP protocol, which caches data at the CH and relay node to prevent the transmission of duplicate data packets. Control packets are leveraged to alert sensor nodes when the data packets are identical and thus avoid redundant transmissions. Laouid and colleagues have designed a routing selection approach that considers hop count and the residual energy of each sensor node to optimize network lifespan.
