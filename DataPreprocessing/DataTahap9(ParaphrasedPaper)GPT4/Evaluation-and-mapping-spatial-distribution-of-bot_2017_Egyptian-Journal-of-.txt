Aquatic sediments are significant sinks for heavy metals and can also act as sources of contamination. These sediments accumulate heavy metals, increasingly so with heightened industrial and urban activities in coastal regions, posing a threat to ecosystems.

Lake Burullus, located to the east of the Rosetta branch of the Nile River, is fed yearly by 4.1 billion cubic meters of water from eight drains and the Brinbal canal. This drainage system serves agricultural lands covering approximately 998,000 acres, culminating in the lake through various pumping stations, with the exception of the Gharbia drain.

Copper (Cu) concentrations were inconsistent across habitats, with lows of 8.7 mg/g in lake islets and highs of 38.45 mg/g in the drains. Other areas exhibited no significant correlation. The contamination factor (CF) for lead (Pb) varied from low to moderate at numerous locations but was notably high at El-Kome El-Akhdr islet. Cobalt (Co) levels ranged from low to moderate with significant highs at El-Mahgra and Brinbal canal. Cadmium (Cd) generally presented moderate CF levels but posed significant concerns at several sites.

The geo-accumulation index (Igeo) indicated moderate pollution levels for cadmium and zinc at certain sites, whereas copper pollution was moderate only at drain 7. Fine sediments dominated some areas of the lake, which contrasted with coarser textures in the middle and northern regions, which also had higher carbonate and lower organic carbon contents. The heavy metal concentration in Lake Burullus sediments followed the order: Fe > Zn > Cr > Cu > Pb > Co > Cd.

Iron, crucial in biological processes and deriving from organic waste and plant debris in sediments, had its maximum level in the southern and western lake areas, likely influenced by agricultural and sewage waste and sediment composition. In contrast, the lowest iron concentrations were found in remote lake islets.

The highest recorded concentration of copper (74 mg/g) was at drain no. 7, affected by agricultural runoff. The values observed for copper and zinc varied but remained under certain regulatory limits, although the zinc levels exceeded the maximum values recorded in previous studies.

Cadmium was notably enriched due to anthropogenic activities, likely stemming from phosphate fertilizers and untreated waste from industrial and agricultural drains. This element's prevalence in sediments raises concerns over its potential harm to living organisms. Metals in sediments fall into two categories: those naturally part of the sediment's mineral structure, like Al, Fe, Mn, and Li, and those from human activities like Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, and Zn, which can become hazardous in high concentrations.
