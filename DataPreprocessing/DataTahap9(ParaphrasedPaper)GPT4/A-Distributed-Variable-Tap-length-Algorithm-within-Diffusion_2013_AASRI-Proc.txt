In this study, the authors present a new algorithm for distributed diffusion networks that can adapt the tap-length used for filtering purposes. Unlike centralized systems with a fusion center, the nodes in these networks communicate within their local groups and use local observations to estimate individual parameters. The novel algorithm adapts not just the weights of the filter taps but also their lengths, helping to reduce the consumption of communication energy and network resources. Results from simulations suggest that the algorithm achieves the expected convergence.

In many scenarios, the length of the adaptive filter taps is presumed to be constant, creating challenges when this value changes or is unknown. Previous algorithms address this issue through incremental learning, but these methods rely on a fixed network structure created by a Hamiltonian cycle arrangement. The authors introduce a new approach that incorporates a fractional tap-length solution suitable for networks with a fully distributed topology, thus enabling the nodes to cope with varying tap-length as well as weight estimation problems. They provide an analysis of this algorithm's performance and verify its convergence through simulations.

The document is divided into five sections. Section 2 outlines the estimation problem, inspiring the development of the new algorithm. Section 3 delves into the steady-state performance analysis. Section 4 provides simulation results supporting the analysis, while Section 5 summarizes the conclusions.

The paper describes a network of \( n \) nodes spread across an area where nodes communicate directly when connected, with each node forming part of a neighborhood network that includes all nodes that can communicate directly with it. Based on the fractional tap-length concept, estimation theory, and distributed LMS (Least Mean Squares) adaptive algorithm principles, the proposed methodology shows promising results, both in theoretical analysis and in practical simulation outcomes.
