The study advances a grammar of Danish that integrates general principles of dependency relations with rules governing sentence structure and phrase extraction, defining a layered system of construction types with extensive applicability. By using hierarchical categories of constituent order that differentiate between types of clauses—main versus subordinate, and declarative versus interrogative—it reinterprets established patterns from Scandinavian languages. This framework also categorizes various extracted elements, providing insights into constructions with topicalization and different types of relative clauses. Importantly, the system can handle sentences with multiple "gaps" or elided elements.

Field schemata, traditionally applied to Germanic languages other than English to describe their distinct sentence topology, need not assume a separate space for precedence relations. Instead, a hierarchy informed by headedness (which conveys word order information in some phrase types) and clausality (which determines clause types) is proposed. These axes enable direct connections between topological features (like subject-verb inversion and adverb placement) and various clause types (declaratives, questions, main or subordinate clauses, and topicalized phrases).

In this grammar, markings within the "nexus field" denote clause types, with inverted subjects and adverbs indicating marked constructions. These markings are not retained at higher construction levels, necessitating the introduction of a "basic constituent order" (BCO) feature that tracks the fundamental sequence of elements in a sentence.

The system models how construction elements like heads, complements, and subjects interact with features such as BCO and markings to define the boundaries of the nexus field and the resulting sentence structure. For instance, attaching a subject marks the end of the nexus field and influences the final word order.

Concerning extraction processes, the grammar builds on existing ideas. Using a slash feature, the model accounts for complement, subject, and adjunct extractions by establishing a continuity between extracted constituents and relevant slots in the sentence structure. It also includes distinct types of relative constructions, such as clauses with a pronoun ("som" relatives), those without a pronoun ("bare" relatives), and clauses with a resumptive subject ("der" clauses).

The grammar successfully addresses the intricacies of Danish word order and extraction within a construction-oriented framework. While comprehensive for many construction types, the ambition is to continually expand the grammar to include other Danish structures, such as imperatives, conditionals, and yes/no questions. Plans for future work also involve adding light objects, negative elements, cleft constructions, and investigating presentational relative clauses to develop a clear typology for Danish.
