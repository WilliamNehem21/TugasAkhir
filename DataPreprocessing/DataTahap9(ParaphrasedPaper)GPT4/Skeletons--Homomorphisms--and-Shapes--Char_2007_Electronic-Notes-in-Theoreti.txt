This paper introduces a systematic framework for analyzing cryptographic protocols and describing the potential behaviors during their execution, using an approach rooted in a concept called strand spaces. The authors define key constructs including skeletons, homomorphisms, and shapes to model and reason about protocols:

- Skeletons represent partial knowledge of the expected (honest) behaviors during a cryptographic protocol's execution.
- A homomorphism is a type of function between skeletons that preserves the information structure, allowing for the mapping of one set of partial information to another.
- Protocol analysis is conceptualized as examining the properties of a category or class of skeletons and their homomorphisms.
- Shapes are defined as a unique minimal set of skeletons that collectively characterize all possible executions of a protocol.

Focusing primarily on authentication properties rather than secrecy (which they plan to address separately), the authors describe how starting from initial assumptions or knowledge about a protocol (an initial skeleton), one can infer a complete set of possible protocol runs, with the minimal complete set being termed 'shapes'. This term refers to the most fundamentally different ways a protocol can be executed.

The paper continues by specifying how individual runs of the protocol, and their associated send and receive events (referred to as regular strands and regular nodes, respectively) are structured, as well as how this information is ordered causally. It explains how messages are constructed and encrypted within this framework.

Through case studies, for example, the ISO Reject protocol and the Needham-Schroeder-Lowe protocol, the authors illustrate the practical application of their framework. They show that some protocols can have multiple shapes, including unintended executions (attacks), while others like Needham-Schroeder-Lowe have a single shape representing the intended execution.

The authors also explore how to manage the infinite set of homomorphisms for any given initial assumptions (preskeleton) by identifying a minimal subset that characterizes all runs, also known as a minimal characterization. By seeking the smallest such characterization based on various criteria (such as the number of nodes or the total size of messages), they aim for an optimal representation.

The paper identifies that for certain protocols, shapes offer a concise representation of all compatible protocol runs, and seeks to define a class of protocols that always result in a finite set of shapes. An algorithm that reasons about secrecy by examining shapes suggests that further properties will be explored in future work.
