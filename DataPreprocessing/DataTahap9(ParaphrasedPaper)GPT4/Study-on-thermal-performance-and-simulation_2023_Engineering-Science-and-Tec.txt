This academic paper primarily explores the thermal behavior of oil medium steel-bonded metal composite (BMC) mechanical joints. Past research has largely centered on the performance of metallic mechanical joints in traditional machinery. Shoukry, for example, looked at the contact stiffness in such joints and formulated a related mathematical model, determining a consistent ratio between tangential and normal contact stiffness. Archenti identified mechanical joint errors as a significant contributor to overall machine tool inaccuracies. Zhao applied fractal contact theory to derive mechanical joint material moduli, while Chen's work incorporated frictionâ€™s impact on joint contact stiffness into a model.

Unlike previous studies, the current paper advances an understanding of steel-BMC mechanical joints immersed in an oil medium. A novel analytical method was created to quantify the real contact area in such joints, taking into account factors like applied weight. This method explored how this contact area changes with varying preload and surface roughness. Additionally, a model representing the joints' thermal parameters was developed, and a virtual material simulation analytical approach was theoretically established to study these joints.

Further explaining the effects of oil medium use, the study shows that contact area increases with greater preload or decreased roughness. As the contact area grows, the thermal attributes of the joint begin to mirror those of its solid counterparts (steel and BMC), which have notably higher thermal conductivity and density compared to lubricating oils. With a focus on a specific BMC bed foundation, the investigation underlines the significant impact of oil medium steel-BMC mechanical joints on both the thermal behavior and the thermal-mechanical interaction characteristics of the foundation.

The analysis then delves into how these thermal performance variations occur. As the actual solid contact percentage rises, the thermal properties progressively reflect the physical characteristics of the solid materials involved. It notes the distinct differences in the thermal properties of steel, BMC, and lubricating oil, and includes technical details such as the elastic modulus of the lubricating oil being 1.5 GPa. The paper also mentions the volume dynamics and resulting pressure changes in the oil due to mechanical joint compression, ultimately affecting the thermal performance of the system.
