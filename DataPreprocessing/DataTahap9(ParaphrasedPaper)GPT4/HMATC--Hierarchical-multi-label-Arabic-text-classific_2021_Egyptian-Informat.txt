Multi-label classification (MLC) is categorized into flat and hierarchical types. In a flat MLC scenario, a set of labels are assigned independently, disregarding any label relationships. Hierarchical multi-label classification (HMC), on the other hand, assigns multiple related labels in a structured hierarchy, presenting a more intricate classification task due to the consideration of label relationships.

Flat classification approaches involve either problem transformation (PT) methods, which convert MLC to single-label classification problems for traditional algorithms, or algorithm adaptation techniques that modify single-label algorithms to handle MLC tasks directly. Algorithm adaptations include multi-label k-nearest neighbor (ML-kNN) and multi-label decision trees (ML-DT).

PT methods typically split the MLC problem into binary classifications (e.g., Binary Relevance (BR), Classifier Chains (CC), Ranking by Pairwise Comparison (RPC)) or multi-class classifications (e.g., Label Powersets (LP), Pruned Sets (PS), Random k-Labelsets (RAkEL)).

HMC, an MLC variant, uses structured label sets, often organized as trees or directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), and needs algorithms capable of handling large label sets.

The paper discusses research by Ahmed et al. on Arabic text classification, using tools like MEKA2 and standard algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) to study the impact of transformation methods on MLC. SVM combined with LP was found to be highly effective. Others, like Shehab et al., adapted classifiers like Random Forest (RF) and Decision Trees (DT) for Arabic news article classification, with DT showing superior performance.

Research by Al-Salemi et al. compared common MLC algorithms and found that RFBoost and LP with SVM were particularly successful, while Elnagar et al. introduced new Arabic datasets and used deep learning models for classification, achieving impressive results with Hierarchical Attention Network-Gated Recurrent Unit (HAN-GRU).

The paper notes that most research has focused on flat MLC, with limited studies on HMC in Arabic texts, typically using the HOMER algorithm and lacking an investigation into feature selection impacts.

The researchers emphasize the scarcity of publicly available hierarchical multi-label Arabic datasets, thus utilizing one from a study by Zayed et al. They detail preprocessing techniques like stemming, feature selection, and the use of HOMER in the Islamic domain. A significant finding was that balanced clustering algorithms like Balanced k-Means performed well with HOMER when handling large label sets.

The paper concludes with a discussion on the evaluation metrics for MLC models, the objectives of the presented work incorporating preprocessing and feature selection with HOMER, and the public availability of the datasets used. Future plans include exploring more classifiers, structured methods for selecting cluster numbers, PCA methods for feature selection, word embedding techniques, and improved preprocessing methods.
