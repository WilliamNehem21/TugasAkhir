The cloud environment offers a range of services at different levels that help organizations manage their processes cost-effectively. Organizations can store their data at minimal costs without the need for expensive in-house servers. Cloud providers deliver these services across presentation, network, and data layers, facilitating inexpensive data management and enabling user access through various services.

An algorithm for preprocessing identifies relevant features and cleanses the dataset of any noise for access trace data. It also appends a list of routes for navigating between the source and destination. The cleaned and feature-enriched trace data is then utilized for estimating latency measures.

Cloud computing, which uses the internet and remote servers for storage and data access, has become a significantly popular solution. Clients rent resources from external providers instead of managing their own. User and key management are vital in cloud computing and involve processes like setting up users, creating and terminating keys. Ensuring data security is essential, and the proposed method encompasses service selection and encryption before data transmission, enhancing various quality of service factors, including lowered latency. Future improvements could involve implementing multi-key homomorphic encryption to bolster secrecy and tackle security challenges in the cloud.
