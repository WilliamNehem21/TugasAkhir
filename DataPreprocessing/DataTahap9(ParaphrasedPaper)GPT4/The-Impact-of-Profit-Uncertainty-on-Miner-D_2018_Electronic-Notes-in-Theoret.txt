The research reveals that miners' knowledge regarding the cost of processing transactions plays a critical role in their profitability from block rewards. When miners have precise information about these costs, their profits from blocks can increase fourfold. Conversely, the research indicates that having precise information about the potential revenue from transactions does not significantly enhance miners' block profits.

Blockchain networks are decentralized ledgers that record and duplicate all transactions across their participants. The strength of blockchain technology lies in its ability to enable secure, trustless transactions without intermediaries. Each block in the blockchain contains a group of transactions and is cryptographically linked to the previous block, forming a chain.

Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, operate on this system, facilitating digital transactions without the need for a third party like a bank. Ethereum introduced smart contracts, expanding blockchain applicability beyond just currency exchange.

Blockchain transactions can be categorized into three types: transfers of digital currency, creation and deployment of smart contracts, and execution of existing contracts. Each transaction requires specific information to be included.

Most contemporary blockchain research focuses on security and privacy issues or performance metrics like throughput and latency. Few utilize modeling and simulation to explore additional aspects of blockchain technology.

Concerning miner profits in systems like Ethereum, miners lack complete information regarding the precise revenue and cost involved in processing a transaction. This uncertainty hinders their ability to choose transactions optimally to maximize profit.

The transaction selection process involves sorting pending transactions, checking block capacity, executing transactions, and repeating until the block is full.

The study involved simulating scenarios related to this uncertainty. Findings showed that certain knowledge of costs dramatically increases profit potential, whereas certainty of income does not produce a similar effect. This suggests that understanding the costs associated with transaction execution significantly influences a miner's block profit.
