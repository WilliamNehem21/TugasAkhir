This academic paper explains that the authors have provided a simple characterization of history-preserving (HP) bisimilarity for higher-dimensional automata (HDA) by exploring the structure of higher-dimensional transitions. The characterization suggests that HP bisimilarity can be determined (decidable) for finite HDA. To develop this understanding, the authors utilized the open-maps framework established by Joyal, Nielsen, and Winskel in relation to the category of unfoldings of precubical sets.

The paper highlights the limitation of traditional bisimulation methods that equate concurrent events with nondeterministic interleaving, as seen with CCS notation where a|b is understood as either a.b or b.a. For many applications, distinguishing between genuine concurrency and interleaving is necessary, prompting the creation of non-interleaving, or truly concurrent, models like Petri nets, event structures, and asynchronous transition systems.

HP bisimilarity for HDA is given a geometric interpretation through the open-maps approach, which the authors apply to demonstrate that HP bisimilarity can be described in terms of the automata's transitions, in contrast to how, for example, Petri nets, focus on runs.

The paper also discusses labeled and unlabeled HDA, indicating that one-dimensional HDA can be viewed as transition systems while asynchronous transition systems correlate to two-dimensional HDA. The authors additionally revisit their previously introduced notion of bisimilarity and demonstrate that this definition aligns with the HP bisimilarity described in their current work.

Finally, the paper ponders whether hereditary HP bisimilarity might be accommodated within the framework. Given the complexity added by backtracking behavior in such systems, the authors imply that a different method might be needed, perhaps involving some form of complex unfoldings of these automata. Considering existing undecidability results, the authors are skeptical about finding a characterization for hereditary HP bisimilarity as straightforward as the one achieved for HP bisimilarity.
