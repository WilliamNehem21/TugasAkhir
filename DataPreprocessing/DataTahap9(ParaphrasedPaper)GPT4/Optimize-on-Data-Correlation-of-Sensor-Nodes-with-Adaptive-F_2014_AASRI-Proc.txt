This paper presents an Adaptive Fault-Tolerant Algorithm (AFTA) that enhances the existing Sensor-MAC (SMAC) protocol by dynamically adjusting the listening and sleep times of sensor nodes based on traffic data. The algorithm takes into account the error decisions made by the sensor nodes and adjusts the SMAC protocol accordingly. It aims to align data judgment with node dynamic listening for improved performance.

The improved SMAC protocol proposed utilizes network traffic size, measured by node throughput, and sets parameters to keep track of the number and size of packets sent and received in each cycle. The protocol incorporates a two-threshold system, denoted as 's' and 'm', to categorize nodes into three different states depending on network conditions.

AFTA suggests increasing data packets transmission time when environmental changes are detected. This is established by the protocol after sending three consecutive decision signals, thereby allowing for an increased data traffic flow. The SMAC duty cycle, as well as the listening time, would be adjusted to ensure prompt decision-making information is relayed, minimizing decision delay data.

For testing, 90 nodes were randomly distributed within a test area, where pairs of nodes formed Constant Bit Rate (CBR) stream transmission links. An adaptive incident detection algorithm using a sliding window restart method was employed. This algorithm required establishing the length 'l' of the sliding window, a binary decision threshold 'th', and a threshold area parameter.

Simulation results indicate that the proposed approach not only significantly reduces unnecessary data transmissions but also leads to lower energy consumption compared to the traditional SMAC protocol. It is also shown that AFTA enhances the efficiency of ruling data transmissions, leading to greater system real-time performance and better reliability. The paper suggests that in the future, the AFTA technique could be further developed for application in larger network environments.
