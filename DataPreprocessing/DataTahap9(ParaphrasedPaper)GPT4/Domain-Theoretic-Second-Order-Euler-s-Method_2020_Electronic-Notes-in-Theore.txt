This paper discusses the common practice of using floating-point arithmetic in computational methods for solving specific problem types, recognizing the inherent inaccuracies such as round-off and truncation errors that come with these implementations. While in some cases these errors are tolerable or can be controlled through error analysis, the paper suggests validated numerics and interval arithmetic as a more reliable alternative, ensuring absolute correctness of results.

Validated numerical methods that use interval arithmetic, particularly those leveraging high-order Taylor-based techniques, provide efficient solutions for the considered problem type when the associated field is analytic. Interestingly, with this assumption, solving these problems can be polynomial time, unlike the more complex nature of these problems without the analyticity assumption.

The paper also outlines how certain operators can offer piecewise affine or quadratic enclosures of a solution, and in specific cases, an exact solution can even be calculated if the solution is a polynomial of degree two or less.

Another key point mentioned is the adoption of a domain-theoretic framework which ensures soundness and completeness in the results, alongside providing convergence rate bounds. This approach contrasts with methods that rely on traditional interval libraries with fixed-precision floating-point numbers, which can only ensure soundness and not completeness due to hardware precision limitations.

The focus of this paper is on a domain-theoretic framework applied to the second-order Euler method for solving initial value problems (IVPs) and how it retains accuracy based on available computational resources. This framework's adaptability is highlighted, as it can extend to any n-th order method, and the paper details soundness, completeness, and bounds on the computational complexity related to this approach.
