The referenced papers [7,8] have investigated the unique challenges posed by the Verification of Concurrently Nondeterministic Algorithms (CNA), which differ significantly from traditional Concurrent CCS processes due to their multiparty and open nature, resulting in a drastic increase in complexity. Where CCS processes have quadratically many successor states, CNA processes face an exponential growth in potential outcomes. Through CNA, one can represent a network of agents as a process that allows for the identification of a Hamiltonian path in the network based on the unique immediate successor of a given process, with details and examples provided in section 4.2 of the paper. The authors explored symbolic methods to manage CNA's complex transition systems.

Emerging challenges in synchronizing multiparty computations were tackled using a novel mechanism (rule com) that blends two variable CCS processes by forming more extended and flexible links between chains. Unlike the classic Dining Philosophers Problem which prescribes a canonical solution to avoid deadlock through constraints, the paper describes a different approach to reach deadlock-free and fair solutions, extending constraints usage to model various other systems like network transportation and service level agreements.

For the Dining Philosophers Problem, the multiparty synchronization calculus proposed in papers [7,8] allowed for an elegant deadlock-free solution. In their tailor-made solution, a philosopher would simultaneously pick up both forks to avoid deadlock. They acknowledge that while this solution avoids deadlock, it doesn't necessarily guarantee fairness as some philosophers might monopolize eating or thinking.

The paper then focuses on a fair solution for the problem, using constraints akin to a ticketing system to ensure philosophers equally share fork usage. Fairness is achieved by ensuring that each computation where a philosopher eats is infinite and that each participant gets to eat indefinitely.

In an initial attempt to solve the problem, a deadlock-free specification was achieved. However, fairness was lacking as philosophers were not prevented from potentially dominating fork access. The solution involved making philosophers wait for their neighbors to eat a certain number of times before they could eat again.

The researchers improved upon this by also regulating the "thinking" actions to alternate between thinking and eating states. They proposed that philosophers must eat after a period of thinking, enabling a more balanced cycle of activities. They delve deeper into a scenario where philosophers choose when to think and eat, emphasizing that those in the thinking state should not hinder others.

Finally, the paper addresses the issue of a truly distributed and deterministic implementation. Despite the conceptually distributed nature of their solution for the philosophers' problem and the one presented in multi-CCS, creating a completely distributed deterministic system for such multiparty synchronization mechanisms remains an unattainable goal with current methods.
