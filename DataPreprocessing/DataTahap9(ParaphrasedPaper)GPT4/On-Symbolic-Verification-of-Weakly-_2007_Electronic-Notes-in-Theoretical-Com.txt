This paper addresses the challenge of verifying a specific type of infinite-state systems known as WPAD systems. These systems are useful for modeling computer programs that include features such as recursive procedure calls and the dynamic creation of parallel processes. WPAD systems are an extension of PAD systems, which combine features of prefix rewrite systems (similar to pushdown systems) and multiset rewrite systems (akin to synchronization-free Petri nets) with an acyclic finite-state control unit.

The authors previously introduced symbolic reachability techniques for PAD systems utilizing unranked tree automata. Their current paper expands on this by applying similar techniques to WPAD systems, thus answering an open question regarding the decidability of model checking for WPAD when using EF logic.

The paper also explores other methods to increase the expressiveness of PRS and PAD systems. One such method includes adding synchronized communications, which results in Turing powerful models. In contrast, adding global control states to the systems results in new models known as SEPRS. Although these models allow for communication between recursive parallel processes and are Turing powerful, when the control automaton's structure is weak with only self-looping loops, the model (WPRS) retains a decidable reachability problem.

The authors tackle the computation of reachability sets for both PRS and WPAD systems. While reachability sets are difficult to compute for general PRS systems due to the complex nature of Petri nets' reachability sets, they demonstrate that if the underlying multiset rewrite system is effectively semilinear, then reachability sets can be effectively computed, as is the case with canonical PAD systems.

The findings suggest that while exact reachability sets are hard to achieve for general PRS systems, one can use an approximate algorithm to obtain overapproximations for reachability for more complex models like WPRS systems. This approximation maintains precision when computing 1-step reachability sets for WPRS systems.

Overall, the paper provides algorithms and theoretical underpinnings needed to effectively manage the complexity of reachability questions in WPAD systems, showing that certain cases allow for decidable solutions while recognizing the power and limitations of the proposed models.
