The paper discusses fingerprint matching by using two main types of features: local and global. Local features, particularly minutiae like ridge endings and bifurcations, are the focus of most fingerprint recognition systems. The global features include pattern types such as core and delta. Recent progress has shown that a large amount of fingerprint information can be recovered from minutiae alone. Fingerprint matching typically involves a two-step process: initial coarse classification followed by detailed minutiae comparison.

In the paper, the researchers begin by reviewing current research on face recognition. They then introduce their own system for organizing fingerprint images using an Adaptive Genetic Neural Network (AGNN). They discuss the results of their novel technique and conclude its effectiveness.

They highlight the range of studies conducted over the past decade on fingerprint cataloging, indexing, and retrieval. They note a common challenge faced by researchers due to the limited number of fingerprint sections available in public databases which hinders the use of advanced statistical methods for recognition. C. Leung and C. H. Leung addressed this by artificially increasing the training samples. Si et al. tackled skin distortion in fingerprints by using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier and a reference database for distortion correction.

Raid Al-Nima et al. introduced a human authentication method based on finger texture patterns, using a robust finger extraction method and an Enhanced Local Line Binary Pattern (ELLBP) to extract features. They suggested a method to recover missing features and employed a Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) for classification.

Wang et al. focused on enhancing fingerprint image quality using a two-phase algorithm that employs two-dimensional discrete wavelet transform and compensates subbands based on a Gaussian template to improve ridge clarity.

The paper also details an effective method for managing and enhancing the quality of fingerprint images. This process involves a denoising step using wave atom transform, morphological operations like dilation and area opening, and finally, classification using AGNN. The adaptive genetic neural network is trained on feature values extracted from images and optimized using a genetic algorithm to improve classification performance during the testing phase.

The proposed method involves dynamically altering the mutation points based on fitness levels in the genetic algorithm and using a crossover operation to create offspring chromosomes. Selection among the chromosomes is based on fitness and execution time.

The proposed technique's performance for accurately organizing images is evaluated and compared to existing neural network methods, with the results showing its effectiveness.
