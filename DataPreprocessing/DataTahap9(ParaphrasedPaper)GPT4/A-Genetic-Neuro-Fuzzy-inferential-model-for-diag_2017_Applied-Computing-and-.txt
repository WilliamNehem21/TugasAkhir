Tuberculosis (TB) is a major public health issue that significantly affects global health. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the leading cause of death among all infectious diseases, particularly among adults. Nigeria has improved access to the TB treatment strategy referred to as Directly Observed Therapy Short-Course (DOTS), with coverage increasing from 45% in 1999 to 75% by 2005, and treatment success for cases in 2005 also standing at 75%. Despite TB incidence in Nigeria being below the average for Sub-Saharan Africa, it is still high with 311 cases per 100,000 population.

Conventional TB diagnostics rely on physical exams and lab tests, which can present challenges such as inadequate medical facilities, especially in developing countries.

This paper highlights the potential of integrating information technology (IT) into TB diagnostics. It proposes an intelligent decision support model that uses a genetic-neuro-fuzzy inferential technique to assist healthcare professionals in providing accurate and cost-effective TB diagnoses in resource-limited settings.

Expert systems (ES) in artificial intelligence (AI) have been developed to enhance healthcare delivery and include notable systems like INTERNIST, MYCIN, CASNET, and EXPERT. These systems have shown to be effective over traditional medical practices.

Neural networks (NNs) consist of interconnected artificial neurons which simulate the biological neurons' properties. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are designed to replicate human brain functions and have been used in various medical applications, such as disease diagnosis.

The study introduces a combined approach of neural networks, fuzzy logic (FL), and case-based reasoning (CBR) for modeling decision support systems (DSS) for the diagnosis of health conditions, including TB.

Databases containing structured quantitative data on TB symptoms and heuristic knowledge from experience are utilized. Genes in this context represent the weighting of diagnostic variables, with chromosomes as vectors encoding solutions for diagnosis. A fitness function optimizes these representations.

The model's simulation tested on ten patients at a Nigerian hospital demonstrated the efficacy of using triangular fuzzy logic membership functions and neural networks for adapting to new situations, complemented by genetic algorithms for optimizing input selection.

While initial validation using TB records was promising, the authors recommend further real-world validation with comprehensive patient data to improve the rule base and training datasets.
