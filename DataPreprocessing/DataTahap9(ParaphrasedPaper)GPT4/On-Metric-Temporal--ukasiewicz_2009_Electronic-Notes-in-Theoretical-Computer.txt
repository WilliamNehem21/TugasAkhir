The argument can be further supported by recognizing the pivotal importance of time progression in physical systems. This is underscored by the observation that breaking a constraint can lead to negative consequences that impact the surrounding environment of the system. Consequently, the research into real-time systems—systems that operate according to time-sensitive constraints—has grown significantly. Such systems require both qualitative and quantitative descriptions of these temporal limitations.
