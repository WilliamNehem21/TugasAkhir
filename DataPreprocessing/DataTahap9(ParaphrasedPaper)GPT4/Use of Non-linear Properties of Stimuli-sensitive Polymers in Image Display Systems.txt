The research presented in this paper reveals that the complexities of designing image display systems can be significantly reduced using the nonlinear characteristics of stimuli-responsive polymers. The suggested approach relies on the combined effect of two heating elements within each pixel. Early experimental evidence supports the viability of this method.

The paper argues that the use of nonlinear properties of stimuli-responsive, especially temperature-responsive polymers, can overcome certain disadvantages. These polymers have been extensively studied by researchers like Dergunov et al., Okano, Barker et al., and Tanaka. Many polymers have been created whose solutions exhibit phase transitions when heated. Prior studies by Dergunov et al., Okano, Barker et al., and Tanaka show a clear connection between the properties of a solution and the stimuli around the phase transition, which is further reviewed in works by Ergozhin et al.

To generate visible light, the researchers utilized LEDs. Light-dependent resistors, serving as sensors for the light emissions, were positioned across from the light source at a distance of 15 mm. The team used a tailor-made electronic system designed to accurately record resistance values from the light-dependent resistor. These recordings were stored in a text file, with the system able to measure changes at a temporal resolution between 1 to 100 microseconds.
