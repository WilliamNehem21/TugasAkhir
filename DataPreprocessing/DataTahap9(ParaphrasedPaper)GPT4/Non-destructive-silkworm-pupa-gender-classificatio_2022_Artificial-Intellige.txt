This academic paper discusses various methods for classifying pupae without damaging the cocoon. Traditional classification methods are limited in that they focus only on the characteristics of the cocoon, not the pupae inside. The paper highlights the use of X-ray technology as a promising alternative that allows for the non-invasive examination of pupa shape characteristics.

The rest of the paper is set up as follows:

- Section 2: Explains the materials and methods, such as sample collection, image pre-processing, feature extraction, and the classification approach.
- Section 3: Presents the results of the classification.
- Section 4: Discusses these results in detail.
- Section 5: Summarizes the paper's major conclusions.

The paper describes how dimension measurement methods like ellipse fitting and minimum rectangular fitting, which help estimate the width and height of regularly shaped objects, can sometimes be inadequate. This led to the proposal of a novel method in this study.

Various dimensionality reduction techniques are discussed, including principal component analysis, linear discriminant analysis, truncated singular value decomposition, t-SNE, and MDS, with results compared across methods.

The study outlines ensemble learning, where multiple learners tackle a single problem, merging their hypotheses to form a unified solution. This approach employs base learners, with the objective of enhancing their performance. Various base learning algorithms are explored, such as decision trees and logistic regression.

A new model is proposed for pupa classification by gender, using LDA in conjunction with AdaBoost and logistic regression as a weak learner. The paper details model specifications, such as hyperparameter tuning with grid search, choice of loss function, and the number of estimators. The model's validity is affirmed through external validation on a test set of images, yielding accuracy rates of 95.3% for FC1 and 95.1% for FC2.

Furthermore, the paper compares the newly proposed width calculation method with traditional methods like ellipse and rectangle fitting methods. Feature extraction is emphasized as critical for classifier performance.

Previous research by Cai et al. with an LDA classification model is cited, which achieved a 93.31% accuracy using shape-describing features from a sample of 1071 cocoons. In contrast, this study improved the understanding of pupa characteristics through a larger sample of 1156 FC1 and 1226 FC2 samples. The research also mentions other gender classification methods for pupae, such as NIR spectroscopy and hyper spectral imaging.

The application of LDA as a dimensionality reduction method is shown to improve the effectiveness of the classifier. With 10-fold cross-validation, the proposed model achieved a mean accuracy of 96.3% for both varieties of pupae. The paper concludes with the stated accuracies achieved during external validation.
