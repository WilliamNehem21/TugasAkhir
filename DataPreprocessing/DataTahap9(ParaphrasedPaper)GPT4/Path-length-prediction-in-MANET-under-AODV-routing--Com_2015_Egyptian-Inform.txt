The paper presents a study on predicting path lengths in mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs), which are networks with no fixed infrastructure, where mobile nodes communicate either directly or through multiple hops. Path length, or the number of hops a message must take to travel from a source to a destination, is critical for understanding the network's performance regarding packet delivery, routing load, and communication delay.

This research applies two predictive models—the AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), a type of neural network—to forecast path lengths in MANETs. The investigators collected data using three different mobility models: Manhattan Grid (MHG), Random Waypoint (RWP), and Reference Point Group Mobility (RPGM). These mimicked various scenarios such as city grids, random movement, and groups moving together under a leader, respectively.

The study found that neural networks (MLP) outperform the statistical ARIMA model in predicting path lengths. Specifically, the MLP is more accurate in its forecasts. The authors point out that group mobility models like RPGM are practical for situations like soldiers moving in formation, with each member's movement heavily influenced by the group leader.

The paper details the methodology used to build the predictive models with the ARIMA process terms (p, d, q) based on time series analysis and the architecture of MLP networks varying hidden layer neuron count. The effects of learning rate on MLP predictive accuracy were also examined.

Performance of the models was assessed by measuring the accuracy of predicting path lengths using data sets from different mobility patterns in the simulation software NS-2 and observed through variations in learning rate and neuron count in the MLP network.

This study indicates that machine learning approaches, specifically MLP neural networks, can effectively improve the forecasting of path lengths in MANETs, which has practical implications in the design and management of such networks.
