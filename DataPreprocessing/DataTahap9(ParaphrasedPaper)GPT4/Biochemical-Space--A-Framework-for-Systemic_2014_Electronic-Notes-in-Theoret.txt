In this paper, the authors address the challenge of specifically annotating organism-based computational models within a public database. They introduce "Biochemical Space" (BCS), a new annotation method supported by tools that help create, manage, and update the content of BCS. The core concept is to build a clear, annotated network of chemical reactions and entities, which serves as a foundation onto which mathematical models can be mapped. This approach facilitates the interpretation of biological processes for a specific organism and has three main advantages: (1) systematic mapping of models onto an organized biological framework, (2) a streamlined annotation process, and (3) solutions for issues like lumped variables in models, the complexity of chemical modifications, and the hierarchical structuring of entities' locations. These advantages extend beyond those of current standards such as the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML).

The paper also discusses the "E-cyanobacterium" initiative, which aims to address domain-specific issues and capitalize on the synergy between repositories and databases, allowing for the creation of complex relationships between models and ontological knowledge bases. BCS organizes reaction networks with respect to existing ontologies and uses a process-based hierarchy for navigation. This hierarchy is accompanied by visual diagrams to simplify the understanding of complex biological mechanisms.

The BCS methodology avoids problems associated with dynamic models and includes features not covered by SBML, such as a more generalized hierarchical compartmentalization, state representation of entities, and approaches to managing combinatorial complexity. A user-friendly textual syntax used to describe BCS can be edited in a specialized editor and visualized on a web platform. BCS consists of a set of entities and the reactions that occur between them, structured to enable easy editing and classification.

The authors developed software tools that support the maintenance of the BCS database and demonstrated its application through the annotation of cyanobacteria processes. BCS provides comprehensive background knowledge for mathematical models and connections between ontologies and the models via well-defined annotations. For visualization and interconnection, an online tool transforms the textual BCS files into structured visualizations that display the interconnectedness of different elements.

In the case study, BCS was used for cyanobacterial processes, showing environmental processes, respiration, photosynthesis, and metabolism within a bioreactor context. The paper outlines how the BCS is essential for providing the biological mechanisms behind these processes, which are sometimes simplified in mathematical models. The authors also mention their current and future work on kinetic models that describe small segments of the metabolic network and their plans to develop a flux-balance analysis model.

In summary, the BCS offers a fresh perspective on annotating biological processes, supporting systematic organization and addressing issues that previous formalisms did not handle, thereby providing a clear link between mathematical modeling and existing annotation databases.
