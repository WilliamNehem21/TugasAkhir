We examine complexity issues related to three types of combinatorial structures: cyclic orders, order varieties, and cycles. It is already established that determining if a cyclic order can be extended to a cycle is NP-complete. Our study finds that addressing the equivalent problem for order varieties, a specific subset of cyclic orders, belongs to the complexity class L. We explore this finding by linking entropy relations within partial orders to the concept of forcing in graph theory.

The paper investigates complexity classes involving three kinds of combinatorial configurations: cyclic orders, order varieties, and cycles. Cyclic orders are ternary relations that, upon fixing a point, become binary partial orders. Order varieties are a particular type of cyclic order where this fixation process is reversible, and no information is lost when any point is fixed. These have significance in proof theory, motivated by concurrency theory and linguistics. Cycles are a subcategory of order varieties resulting in linear orders when a point is fixed. Background information is recapitulated in Section 2.

A cyclic order is defined as an anti-reflexive, cyclic, and transitive ternary relation on a set. An order variety is described as a spreading cyclic order, and a cycle is a total cyclic order. There is an inherent understanding that cycles are spreading. Since the concept of cycles is more comprehensive than cyclic orders, cyclic orders fall within the NP complexity class. However, by converting a set of triples into a cyclic transitive relation, checking if this forms a cyclic order, and then applying the algorithm for cyclic orders, the issue reduces, proving that solving for cyclic orders is NP-complete.
