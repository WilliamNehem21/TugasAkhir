The paper discusses advancements in model checking for a modal fixpoint logic known as FLC, which can describe nonregular properties. The authors introduce an improved symbolic model checker and detail the process of parallelizing the algorithm. They also report on a preliminary version implemented in Glasgow Parallel Haskell (GPH) and its performance on a cluster of workstations.

The state space explosion issue, a significant challenge in model checking, is addressed by using symbolic methods. These methods operate directly on process descriptions and typically result in superior performance.

In GPH, a virtual shared heap makes all program variables accessible as though they are on a single processor. The runtime system handles necessary data transfers between processors, enabling the development of scalable programs that can utilize numerous processors without being limited by the hardware constraints of physical shared memory systems.

Haskell's FFI interface allows the use of optimized C code for basic Binary Decision Diagram (BDD) operations. BDDs in Haskell are represented as foreign objects, which are data structures created outside the Haskell heap and managed by a C heap, with pointers and finalizer routines for garbage collection.

The paper highlights the use of producer-consumer (or pipeline) parallelism where both work simultaneously on the same data structure. This form of parallelism, in conjunction with divide-and-conquer strategies, leads to efficient test set generation. Additionally, computing the test set in parallel is feasible, further enhancing performance.

A key objective in designing the parallel algorithm is scalability, allowing for future expansion with more processors without needing code changes. However, scalability can lead to unnecessary data transfers between heaps. By incorporating laziness, where operations are delayed until parallelism is certain, the single processor performance could be improved, although this makes implementation more complex. This complexity is being addressed by adding marshalling functions to foreign objects, which are automatically triggered during graph packing, ensuring data transfers are only conducted when necessary for parallel execution, thus simplifying the parallel code in GPH.

This summary has condensed the main points and technical aspects of the paper, emphasizing the methods employed to enhance the model checking process through parallelism and symbolic techniques in a Haskell environment.
