We study the aspect of opacity pertaining to the confidential segments of a system, in view of the public segment's state observation and actions. Our research introduces a Petri net approach designed for defining diverse information flow attributes by specifying particular system behavior observations. We also explore the capabilities and limitations of our framework and address the solvability of verification tasks related to it.

The concept of secrecy is multifaceted in computer security research. A prominent theory is 'non-interference', ascribed to Goguen and Meseguer, although its roots precede their work. This theory aims to establish the total lack of, or specifically, the lack of causation in data transmission between processes. Petri nets have been used as a recent method for representing this theory structurally, thanks to work by Busi and Gorrieri.

The goal is to ensure that observations made by unauthorized users do not narrow down the potential range of sensitive inputs. In essence, those unauthorized users shouldn't be able to infer any confidential interactions. Although the original theory has some recognized issues, various adaptations have been suggested, with an extensive review available in the literature.

Additionally, we apply the concept of 'initial-opacity' through the 'dining cryptographers' scenario, which indicates its effectiveness in scenarios requiring the secrecy of information like cryptographic keys at the initiation phase. Meanwhile, 'always-opacity' seems better suited for ongoing confidentiality needs.

We have implicitly assumed the observability of each transition step within the system. However, one might also want to contemplate entirely undetectable transitions and steps. We propose a method to incorporate this aspect into our current framework.

For instance, in the dining cryptographers' scenario, Anne and Bob, two cryptographers, enjoy a meal knowing the bill is paid but are uncertain if the NSA or one of them covered the charge. They desire to ascertain this without tipping off an eavesdropper about who paid. Our model, which represents the different states of coins and their visibility to Anne and Bob, helps to understand which initial conditions could maintain secrecy about who paid the bill.
