Traditional logic gates like AND gates are not suitable for constructing reversible computers, and a different design strategy is required. The paper outlines both basic elements and more intricate circuits created using MOS technology, which are currently relevant for low-power digital circuits and could potentially be important for future quantum computing applications.

Hardware configurations using dual lines enable a straightforward way to create inverters by simply swapping the two lines, essentially hardwiring a NOT gate. Controlled NOT gates are NOT gates that operate based on the state of switches. An instance provided is the controlled NOT gate.

However, the paper emphasizes that reversible MOS circuits have practical applications today. As they are a reversible variant of pass-transistor logic, they are well-suited for adiabatic computing, where signals are slowly transitioned from an intermediate level to their final value. This method can lead to a significant reduction in power consumption, approximately by a factor of ten.
