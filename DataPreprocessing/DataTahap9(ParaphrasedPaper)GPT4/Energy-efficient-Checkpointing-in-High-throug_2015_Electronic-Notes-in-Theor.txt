The paper's structure is organized as follows: related literature is reviewed in Section 2, Section 3 outlines the experimental setup and simulation methodology based on real-world datasets for checkpointing in high-throughput computing (HTC) environments. Section 4 discusses various established checkpointing algorithms and introduces new strategies that take into account energy usage and failure rates. The negative impact of these checkpointing methods on energy consumption is demonstrated in Section 5, highlighting the importance of understanding checkpointing strategies' effects in HTC clusters. Section 6 presents key considerations for implementing checkpointing in such environments, and the paper concludes in Section 7.

Unsal et al.'s work evaluates the energy efficiency of application-level fault tolerance mechanisms, and suggests a task scheduling approach that can reduce energy usage by up to 40%. Unlike their focus on real-time systems with budgetary limitations, this paper deals with the context of HTC environments, where maximizing overall throughput is the priority over individual task completion times, often disregarding strict deadlines in resource allocation.

Existing simulation tools for grids and clusters, such as SimGrid, GridSim, and OptorSim, emphasize resource selection and do not accurately model energy usage. Newer cloud simulators like CloudSim, GreenCloud, and MDCSim address the balance between cost, quality of service, and energy consumption, but fall short in simulating multi-use clusters with interactive workloads and don't incorporate checkpointing.

The paper improves upon the simulation environment by incorporating the checkpoint model introduced in Section 3.3 and assesses various checkpointing strategies discussed in Section 4, considering not just energy consumption and average task duration, but also other performance metrics to gauge the overall impact on the system.

Checkpointing policies are delved into, categorized by their approach to determining checkpoint intervals and evaluating if and when to perform checkpointing. Additionally, a set of proactive migration policies are proposed to anticipate failures and migrate tasks to more reliable resources.
