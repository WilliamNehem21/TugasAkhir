The current implementation of aerobic composting projects for domestic sludge treatment is limited. As of late October 2002, a new facility for sludge disposal was established in the Panggezhuang area of Daxing District, in the southern outskirts of Beijing, handling sludge from the Gaobeidian sewage treatment plant with a capacity of 160,000 tons per day. Research indicates that aerobic composting can diminish nitrogen losses, thus mitigating environmental pollution during the composting process and enhancing the quality of the resulting compost. Through the degradation of organic matter into humic substances, the composting process is capable of binding heavy metals, reducing their bioavailability in the resulting sludge. However, the capacity of the composting process to immobilize heavy metals is relatively restricted, and therefore not very efficient, particularly when sludge contains high heavy metal content. Moreover, though composting can break down many organic pollutants present in sludge, there are often persistent organic substances that remain in the compost due to limitations related to the duration and conditions of the composting process. Consequently, to improve the effectiveness of composting technology in sludge treatment, there is a need for enhanced measures to conserve nitrogen, curtail nitrogen loss, and increase the immobilization of heavy metals along with the degradation rate of organic pollutants.

This summary is based on the findings from literature sources including Goldstein et al. (1993) in BioCycle, which discusses the advancements in biosolids composting; Goldstein et al.'s (1994) survey in BioCycle regarding biosolids; and Augenstein et al.'s (1996) study published in Resources, Conservation and Recycling on the potential of composting municipal solid waste and sewage sludge for fuel gas production in a developing country.
