The paper discusses the use of model-based testing as a method to ensure that a system meets its specification by automatically generating test cases. The main strategy involves leveraging model-checking tools to identify a suite of test cases that address various aspects of the system's functionality, which is framed as a problem of reachability. This process is informed by coverage criteria, which define specific elements or 'coverage items' within a system that the tests should assess.

The authors propose a new on-the-fly algorithm for generating test suites that cover all pertinent coverage items without unnecessary duplication of tests. The algorithm selectively explores system states that have the potential to increase coverage and makes decisions based on a holistic view of the entire state space rather than isolated branches, ensuring that model states are not repeatedly explored unnecessarily.

The paper further outlines the framework used to automatically generate test cases based on reachability analysis, introducing an advanced algorithm that leverages global state-space information to optimize the test generation process. The authors compare their algorithm with previous methods through experimental studies, highlighting its efficiency in terms of both the state space generated and execution time, particularly when complex coverage criteria are in play.

Moreover, they explain how their work connects to prior research on flow-based coverage criteria, subsumption of coverage items, and directed model-checking techniques. Their algorithm is applicable to various automata-based models, including finite state machines and timed automata.

The authors conclude by summarizing their contributions to test suite generation for automata models and emphasize that their algorithms, which incorporate techniques used in model checking, are capable of creating optimal test suites based on chosen coverage criteria.
