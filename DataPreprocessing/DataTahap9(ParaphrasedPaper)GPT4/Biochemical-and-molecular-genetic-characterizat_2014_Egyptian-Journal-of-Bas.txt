The study utilized a Bio-Rad video documentation system (model Gel Doc 2000) to photograph and analyze gels. The presence or absence of bands in the gels was encoded as binary data (1 for presence, 0 for absence) within a matrix for analytical purposes. Analysis was conducted using SYSTAT software, version 7.0.

Results indicated that the primer in question generated 12 bands across the studied taxa. Key findings included:

- Bands of 830 bp and 370 bp size were universally present.
- Unique 600 bp and 680 bp bands in Lavatera cretica suggested they could serve as specific molecular markers for this species.
- A consistent 700 bp band was observed in all taxa.
- Specific bands of other molecular sizes, such as 1500 bp and 590 bp, were identified in certain taxa or accessions, allowing them to function as unique markers for specific populations.
- Common bands across various taxa were seen at 680 bp and 420 bp, with other specific-sized bands absent or present in certain taxa or accessions, providing potential negative or positive molecular markers.
- Across different primers, varying ranges of molecular sizes were detected, from 200 bp to 2900 bp, with a mixture of polymorphic and common bands that helped to distinguish between taxa.
- A total of 18 bands were observed with protein electrophoresis, exhibiting different levels of presence among the taxa, ranging from 11 to 15 bands with molecular weights from 11.3 to 115.3 kDa.

The paper concludes by emphasizing the utility of biochemical and molecular techniques, such as seed storage protein electrophoresis, isozyme polymorphisms, and DNA-based genetic markers, for evaluating genetic diversity independent of plant developmental stages. Despite the limitations of protein and isozyme markers in detecting polymorphisms among closely related cultivars, DNA-based markers are highlighted as crucial tools in molecular genetics and plant breeding due to their heightened ability to distinguish genetic differences.
