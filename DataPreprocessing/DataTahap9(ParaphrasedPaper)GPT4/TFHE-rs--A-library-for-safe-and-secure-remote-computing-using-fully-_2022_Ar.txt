As organizations and applications process sensitive data, they must implement robust measures to maintain strict privacy and integrity standards, particularly in the context of cloud computing. Two complementary security technologies for protecting data are homomorphic encryption (HE) and hardware-based trusted execution environments (TEEs). 

HE allows computations to be performed directly on encrypted data, concealing its true content. Research in HE saw a significant advancement in 2009 when Craig Gentry presented the first fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) scheme. This breakthrough opened the door for outsourcing computations involving sensitive data, such as medical records, financial information, and genomic data, which were previously restricted to internal processing due to confidentiality issues.

However, HE on its own faces challenges, such as threats to data integrity. This is where TEEs come in, offering hardware-based isolation for secure computation, which boosts data integrity. A prominent TEE example is Intel's Software Guard Extensions (SGX), which faces criticism due to potential vulnerabilities to side-channel attacks and the requirement of trust in the TEE's manufacturer and their software.

To mitigate these issues and enhance security, a hybrid approach is suggested utilizing FHE for data confidentiality and TEEs for data integrity, implemented using the memory-safe programming language Rust. Rust helps to avoid many common and severe security bugs, providing a safer computing environment.

The paper introduces the TFHE-RS library, which integrates FHE with computation inside a TEE, specifically combining TFHE and Intel SGX. This hybrid system minimizes the risk of data malleability and enhances overall security compared to using FHE or SGX independently. While encryption schemes typically secure against standard attacks, the hybrid approach shows promise in safeguarding against more advanced threats, including those that exploit encryption systems' integrity vulnerabilities.

Additionally, the authors highlight potential hardware attacks on TEEs, recognizing the need to consider both hardware and software threats. Overall, the article provides a novel viewpoint on combining FHE with TEEs, using Rust to reinforce security, and conducting experiments to validate the performance and security advantages of the proposed approach.
