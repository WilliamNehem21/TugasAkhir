In recent years, adaptivity has become a major aspect of developing modern information and communication systems which incorporate concepts such as intelligent systems, cyber-physical systems, the Internet of Things, and self-aware computing. These systems are essentially a network of distributed, autonomous subsystems that dynamically integrate and adjust their actions in response to changes in their environment. The paper refers to these as self-adaptive and self-organizing (SASO) systems.

The paper presents a foundational system model for SASO systems, constructing the basis on which these systems are understood, including the assumptions made by the authors. It also reviews literature related to SASO systems. Following that, the paper proposes a method to assess the stability of an SASO system's adaptive behavior and provides experimental analysis to evaluate this approach. The conclusion offers a summary and suggests directions for future research.

SASO systems are composed of autonomous subsystems that can independently adjust their actions by being self-aware of internal and external conditions. These subsystems interact with the environment, which includes other systems, hardware, software, humans, and natural phenomena. The boundary of each system separates the system itself from its environment.

The paper notes that only a small number of studies have focused on general metrics for quantifying the effort and benefits of adaptation in distributed autonomous systems. It cites references for an overview and mentions traditional metrics used for system performance and how they are applied or modified for SASO systems. A key area that has been understudied is the degree of adaptation, the stability of these adaptations over time, and how to balance the performance improvements for individual components against potential negative effects on the overall system behavior.

As an example, the work by Kinoshita is mentioned, who proposed a measure to detect unusual activity in a distributed multi-agent system. This measure involves computing an 'activity factor' based on the status of each agent (active or inactive) and analyzing the variance in the activity factor over time. This helps in identifying significant events or disturbances within the system, albeit its effectiveness varies depending on the level of background 'noise' present in the environment.

This summary highlights the main focus of the paper without delving into the specific experimental details or precise findings from section 4. For a more exhaustive understanding, reading the full paper would be necessary, as this paraphrase aims only to provide a general overview of the topics and themes addressed in the original document.
