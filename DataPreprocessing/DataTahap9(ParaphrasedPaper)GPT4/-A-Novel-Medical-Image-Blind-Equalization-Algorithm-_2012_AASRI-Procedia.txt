A CT (computed tomography) image provides insight into how different organs and tissues within the body absorb X-rays, which is useful for detecting tiny, in vivo lesions in the microstructure. CT imaging is a crucial tool in medical image diagnostics. However, during the imaging and transmission processes, image quality can deteriorate due to the influence of a two-dimensional effect called the point spread function, leading to blurring of the images. This degradation can negatively affect both the image's clarity and the accuracy of medical diagnoses.

In many cases, the exact cause of a CT image's degradation is not known, which is where blind image restoration comes into play. This technique aims to remove interference and noise from images when the degradation process is unknown, attempting to recover the original image quality as closely as possible and restoring the image for proper display and diagnostic use.
