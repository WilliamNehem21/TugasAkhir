This academic paper discusses the advancements in the H.264 video coding standard and its application to the challenge of watermark robustness, which is the struggle between watermark embedding and watermark removal or corruption by attackers. The main goal is to ensure that watermarks can survive various types of attacks without overly damaging the quality of the original video.

The authors expand upon their previous work by addressing watermark desynchronization issues. They provide detailed models for both watermark embedding and detection, as well as models for desynchronization attacks that could be performed by attackers. A modified embedding and detection algorithm is introduced to counteract these attacks, and the impact of each type of attack on video quality and watermark robustness is analyzed through experimentation. Additionally, the paper investigates the benefits of combining the Longest Common Substring (LCS) technique with a probabilistic model to enhance watermark detection.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 reviews related works, Section 3 presents the problem formulation and the developed models, Section 4 explains the details of the modified algorithm, and Section 5 discusses the experimental results. The paper concludes with Section 6.

The study emphasizes the importance of the LCS computation for the modified watermarking algorithm, which is independent of the watermark's actual content but rather focuses on the lengths of contiguous common substrings between the extracted and reference watermarks.

Different attack scenarios are considered, examining their potential to corrupt the watermark and the resulting video distortion. These scenarios range from negating the watermark to manipulating the watermarked blocks to disrupt synchronization between the extracted watermark and the reference.

One key idea presented is that the detection algorithm can identify watermarks even if up to 95% of them have been tampered with or altered from ones to zeros, utilizing a probabilistic embedding algorithm. This resilience is achieved by not relying solely on exact watermark values but on contiguous parts of the watermarks.

The paper concludes that the proposed algorithm is effective in mitigating desynchronization problems for various digital media types. It also addresses attacks that alter watermark lengths, which previous algorithms using correlation cannot handle. The authors recommend a specific embedding threshold to optimize watermark robustness and offer simulation results supporting their claims. Overall, the research contributes to the development of more robust watermarking techniques in the face of potential attacks, aiming to ensure watermark persistence while maintaining video quality.
