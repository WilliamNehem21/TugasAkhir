The academic paper discusses the incorporation of Arabic into the Gender Identification (GI) dataset by the PAN community, beginning in 2017, noting that the methods explored were not specific to Arabic and resulted in low GI accuracies. It highlights the lack of research on GI for the Egyptian dialect.

Hussein et al. used classical machine learning to address GI in Egyptian dialect, creating a model that combined a feature vector of embeddings and semantic features with a Random Forest classifier, alongside an n-gram vector with a Logistic Regression classifier, achieving an 87.6% accuracy on a dataset of Egyptian dialect tweets from Twitter.

Kodiyan et al. worked on gender detection across various languages and dialects, finding that Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) were more effective than Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), with accuracies of 79.03%, 72.57%, 79.5%, and 71.58% for English, Spanish, Portuguese, and Arabic, respectively.

Miura et al. developed a model using RNNs for word embedding and CNNs for character embedding with multiple attention layers, pre-trained on a Twitter dataset to achieve an average accuracy of 79.17% for GI in dialectical Arabic.

The authors of the paper propose neural network (NN)-based models to solve the GI problem, employing various architectures such as CNNs, Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), and more. They begin with simple NN models and gradually introduce complexity by combining elements from different NN models to enhance GI accuracy. They explore a range of NN architectures, fine-tuning their parameters.

The GRU, modified from LSTM and featuring two gates—the reset and update gates—is described. A simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN) consisting of an embedding layer and fully connected layers is outlined, with dropout and activation functions specified to achieve the highest GI accuracy after multiple experiments.

The paper concludes by noting the opportunity for future research to consider posted images and include language-specific features, such as the use of gender-specific suffixes and prefixes, in the NN models to improve GI accuracy. It also reports high GI accuracy, up to 91.37%, when employing a multichannel CNN with Bidirectional GRU on Egyptian Dialect Gender Arabic Dataset (EDGAD).
