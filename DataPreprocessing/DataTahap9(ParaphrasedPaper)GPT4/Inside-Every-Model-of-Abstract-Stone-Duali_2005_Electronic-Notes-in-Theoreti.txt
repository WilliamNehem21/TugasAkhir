The academic paper asserts that the creation of subtypes, denoted {x| e}, requires that they are formed without any free variables, despite variable "e" being part of the definition. It emphasizes that the syntax of dependent type theories is inherently complex.

It acknowledges that while a specific result about open subspaces may seem theoretically significant, it is practically of little value; the broader implications of this result will become evident in the form of an induction principle stated in Corollary 10.12. This principle can be summarized as follows: any subset containing the element nil and closed under a certain operation, denoted as "::," must constitute the entire space. This concept is set to be a foundational argument in Section 6.

A limitation in the current framework is noted concerning the operation "+". While the operation itself appears straightforward, proving that the sum of subtypes l1 and l2 (denoted l1+ l2) is valid within the system is complicated. The issue arises when trying to confirm that if l1 belongs to the subtype x(n) and l2 to x(m), their combination l1+ l2 should naturally belong to x(n+m). The paper suggests that their method of inductive reasoning is insufficient because it is only able to progress from n to n+1. The definition and correct usage of the "+" operation are projected to be clarified in Lemma 10.9, where a recursion scheme involving nil and "::" will be employed. However, the authors note that substantial work remains before reaching that point.
