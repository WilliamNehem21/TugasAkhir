This academic paper presents a method for verifying the soundness of concurrent separation logic by introducing the concept of semantic proofs that annotate points in a thread's code with descriptions of its local state. Unlike traditional Hoare triple interpretations which abstract away the internal syntax of commands, the paper's approach retains this syntax intentionally, as it is seen to be essential in understanding issues related to state partitioning, which can cause unsoundness when dealing with imprecise resource invariants.

The paper establishes a connection between thread-local semantic proofs and the operational semantics of the program through the separation property, which ensures that the program state can be divided into parts owned by each thread and each free lock. This connection helps to prove the soundness of the rules of concurrent separation logic.

Semantic proofs are shown to be beneficial for the soundness verification of program logics, borrowing ideas from abstract interpretation in program analysis. The strategy has been applied beyond the simple language discussed, to more complex languages and to prove the soundness of logics for preemptive operating system kernels. The paper suggests that the semantic proof-based approach is efficient for proving the soundness of intricate concurrency logics.
