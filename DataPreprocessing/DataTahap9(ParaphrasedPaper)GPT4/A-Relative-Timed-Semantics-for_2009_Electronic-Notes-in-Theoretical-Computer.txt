This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN), while an introduction to the formal methods CSP and Z is provided in the appendix. Section 3 presents a syntactic description of BPMN. Section 4 outlines a timing semantics associated with BPMN elements. Section 5 discusses properties that relate timed and untimed models using CSP refinements and returns to an example to demonstrate the incorporation of time constraints in modeling transition behaviors in BPMN, stating that each atomic task must have a positive duration, and defines a BPMN state in terms of subprocess states.

The paper describes the implementation of the semantics as a tool developed in Haskell, which is available on the authors' website. This tool converts BPMN diagrams in XML format, accompanied by timing information, to ASCII files containing machine-readable CSP processes.

The paper also distinguishes between timed and untimed diagrams, emphasizing that a timed diagram is an enhanced version of an untimed one with added timing information. It introduces a property illustrating the concept of "timed variation."

Furthermore, it defines the notion of a "characteristic participant" within a timed collaboration, which aligns with W3C standards but differs from other definitions that may not be directly applicable to business process developers. The semantic model proposed is designed to facilitate analysis of multiple diagrams and preserves timed-independent behavioral properties in comparison to previous untimed models.
