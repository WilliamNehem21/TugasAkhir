The betweenness centrality is a key metric in network analysis that is connected to the structure of communities within a graph. It quantifies the importance of a vertex (node) in terms of being a bridge along the shortest paths between other pairs of nodes: specifically, the betweenness centrality of a vertex 'v' is calculated by tallying, for each distinct pair of nodes 's' and 't' that are not 'v', the proportion of the shortest paths from 's' to 't' that pass through 'v' relative to all shortest paths from 's' to 't'. Despite extensive prior research, there is no algorithm known to compute betweenness centrality faster than subquadratic time, even for a single vertex. The paper suggests that the difficulty of computing the subset graph's properties is an intrinsic issue of the problem itself, not merely due to the size of the output, therefore negating the possibility of faster algorithms for correctness verification or handling of instances with sparse outputs.

The article is organized as follows:

Section 2: Introduction of problem statements and the concept of quasilinear reducibility.

Section 3: Presentation of new hardness results (further proof details are in the extended version of the paper).

Section 4: Positive findings concerning the identification of transitive and comparability graphs.

Section 5: Conclusion and presentation of some unresolved questions.

Proofs provided in the paper link the difficulty of the betweenness centrality problem to the challenge of solving the k-SAT problem and determining the diameter of graphs specifically for split graphs (which extend to chordal graphs as well), illustrating that computing graph diameter in these scenarios is as hard as a core problem named graphdiameter2or3. Additional proof of the hardship of hyperbolicity problems, which are tougher than graphdiameter2or3, is also presented through the statement of two lemmas.
