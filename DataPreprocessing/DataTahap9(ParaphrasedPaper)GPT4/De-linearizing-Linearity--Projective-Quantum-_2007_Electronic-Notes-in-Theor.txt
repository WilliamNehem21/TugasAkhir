This academic paper discusses the structural qualities of additive types in the context of categorical quantum mechanics. It establishes that these types can be distributed over a tensor structure, facilitating the creation of measurements and the validity of related protocol correctness proofs in a less stringent environment. A comprehensive probabilistic framework emerges when the trace operation is both linear and obeys the diagonal axiom. One of the paper's principal findings is identifying the essential additive properties for a categorical quantum formalism that is both qualitatively and quantitatively effective, without the unnecessary complexity of global phases.

The paper also demonstrates that within a category where an additive monoidal tensor distributes over a strongly compact closed tensor (SCCC), that category will inherently contain commutative monoids. It is shown that the ortho-structure, which ensures compatibility of the pseudo-projections with the SCCC structure, is the only necessary aspect of the biproduct structure for qualitative applications. As a result, additional product structures that don't inherently interact with the existing SCCC structure can be introduced freely.

In conclusion, the paper breaks down the concept of additives into two primary components: the ortho-structure, which is fundamental to the system, and an external classical branching structure that can be added independently. Although the paper employs a simple version of this classical branching structure, it suggests that more complex versions could be used to capture other phenomena like classical mixing. The key takeaway is that this additional structure can sit atop the foundational ortho-SCCC structure without being a necessary part of it.
