The paper discusses the importance of interactive debuggers in programming environments and introduces TIDE, a universal debugging framework associated with the ASF+SDF Meta-Environment. TIDE is adaptable for use in varying stages of language development, such as debugging during the process of language design.

Creating comprehensive programming tools for small or domain-specific languages is often not practical due to the considerable effort in development and upkeep. The ASF+SDF Meta-Environment aids in language prototyping by allowing for the creation of language specifications, which can then generate tools such as parsers, interpreters, and pretty printers.

The ASF+SDF Meta-Environment serves as a tool for defining languages and generating other tools from these definitions. A language defined in ASF+SDF will typically include syntax, pretty-printing, type-checking, and program execution capabilities.

The paper focuses on ASF, a declarative formalism that uses rewrite rules and is a strongly typed, first-order language that facilitates list matching and tree traversal, and is closely integrated with SDF through syntax reuse.

TIDE offers debugging features like stepping through programs, setting breakpoints, and inspecting variables and stack frames. The extent of TIDE's functionality depends on the language it is applied to. Breakpoints require information such as source location and possibly stack depth and a serialized variable environment.

The ASF interpreter includes 21 logical breakpoints that are marshalled to TIDE, providing full ASF debugging capabilities with an implementation of 350 lines of C code.

For languages already defined in ASF+SDF, it is relatively simple to leverage TIDE for debugging. A specialized ASF+SDF module encapsulates the TIDE adapter API, allowing language specifications to be instrumented easily with debugging calls, like in the case of the Pico language.

While using this approach doesn't offer the same level of detail as manually writing a TIDE adapter, it balances automation (requiring less effort from the user) with expressivity (allowing more detailed manual coding for increased functionality).
