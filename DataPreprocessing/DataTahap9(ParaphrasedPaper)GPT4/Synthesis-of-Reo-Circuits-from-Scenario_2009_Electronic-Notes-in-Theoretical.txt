The paper discusses the complexity involved in constructing service-oriented applications that operate on large-scale distributed systems. These applications feature services that must collaborate, necessitating intricate coordination. A key challenge is formulating an effective coordination model to define the interactions and dependencies among the services accurately. For instance, in an online banking application, the system must ensure that a user logs in only after their account credentials are properly authenticated.

A central concept introduced in the paper is Reo, a coordination model based on the idea of channel-based exogenous coordination. In Reo, complex coordinators, termed "connectors," are built by composing simpler ones. However, the paper only offers a summary of the main concepts of Reo, with further details available in referenced works.

The paper also explains synchronous and asynchronous drains, which are channels that can accept data but do not emit it, meaning that data entering a drain is effectively lost. Synchronous drains require simultaneous data presence at both of their source ends to accept an item, while asynchronous drains do not. Conversely, (a)synchronous spouts, which have two sink ends, are the direct counterparts to drains.

When discussing timing constraints in UML Sequence Diagrams (SDs), the paper describes how messages are constrained by time, possibly leading to ambiguity in interpretation. For instance, if a receiver cannot process a message within a specified interval, it is unclear whether the message is to be dropped or queued. The paper assumes that messages successfully reach the receiver and await processing. This assumption allows the researchers to continue development by connecting designated nodes in a circuit they are constructing.

The authors aim to automate their described synthesis approach in the future and have already developed a suite of integrated visual tools to aid in the coordination of components and services; these include graphical editors, animators, simulators, and model checkers. They plan for their tools to assist in the model-based development of service-oriented applications, particularly geared towards designers working on complex coordination tasks.
