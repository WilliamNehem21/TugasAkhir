This academic paper discusses the application of indexed and fibred categorical concepts to the field of computer science, specifically for modeling logical systems and type theories. It concentrates on Hoare logic, proposing that a complete categorical analysis of its axiomatic semantics requires the integration of both indexed and fibred category theory.

The paper points out that the structural elements of Hoare logic are best represented within an indexed setting. On the other hand, the logical aspects of deduction are suitably modeled within a fibred category. Specifically, it highlights how Hoare triples, which are key components of Hoare logic, emerge as special kinds of morphisms (arrows) in a fibred category built over a syntactic category of programs. The process of deduction in the Hoare calculus is categorically characterized by a combination of generating certain types of arrows, known as cartesian arrows, and composing these arrows.

The authors mention that while functors preserve structure, they donâ€™t necessarily maintain logical properties. To ensure that logical properties are preserved, a notion of universality is needed, and cartesian arrows are instrumental in providing this. Even though cartesian arrows are part of the definition of fibred categories, indexed categories also supply cartesian arrows, with the added benefit of delivering more structural detail.

The paper addresses the various ways in which Hoare logic has been presented in the literature, including different approaches to defining the weakest liberal precondition and semantically defining the behavior of programs. The main contribution of the paper is a systematic and unified approach to describing Hoare logic by employing both indexed and fibred category languages. The analysis reveals that the most suitable approach to handling axiomatic semantics, at least within the confines of Hoare logic, is to utilize the structural features provided by indexed categories and the logical deduction aspects provided by fibred categories.

Finally, the paper argues that understanding the relationship between indexed and fibred concepts can be very beneficial for presenting, analyzing, and effectively using logical systems. It concludes with the observation that the structural characteristics of Hoare logic, traditionally presented in an indexed manner, can be elevated to a broader and more abstract level by utilizing indexed categories. This more general approach points to the possibility of extending Hoare logic from simple single-program settings to more complex environments involving multiple programs or compound systems.
