The essence of Theorem 1.1 presented in the paper is that the problem of identifying the largest topological grid minors within planar graphs with a maximum degree of 6 is NP-hard. The proof for this theorem is based on a creative reduction, which is briefly outlined in Section 1.4, from the well-known NP-complete problem, planar monotone 3-SAT.

The paper then provides a method for constructing certain configurations within a graph. A cycle is described with four coordinates, forming a square. To insert a "left arrow" on the face denoted as f, one must substitute the edge that connects (i, j) and (i, j+1) with a path that introduces two new vertices, s1 and s2, and creates a detour through these vertices, while also adding connecting edges from (i+1, j) to s1 and from (i+1, j+1) to s2. Analogous procedures are specified for inserting "right arrow," "up arrow," and "down arrow" configurations into the graph.

Additionally, the paper describes certain specialized structures called bifurcation faces and mentions the creation of a specific edge between s2 and s3, as well as a new edge that links s1 to a vertex that is adjacent to the bottom-right edges of a specified face, f1. Here, two particular faces, f1 and f0, are identified as bifurcation faces with f0 additionally labeled as the right connection face of what is termed the positive bifurcation gadget. The description of the positive bifurcation gadget is completed with these details, and the paper signals the addition of further components to this construction, though the description of these additional components is not provided in the excerpt you have shared. 

In summary, the paper discusses complex procedures for manipulating graphs to prove the intractability of finding large grid minors, connecting this to the theory of computational hardness.
