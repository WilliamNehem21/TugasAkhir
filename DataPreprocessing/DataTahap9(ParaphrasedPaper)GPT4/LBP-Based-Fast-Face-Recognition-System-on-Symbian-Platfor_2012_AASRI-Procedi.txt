This paper discusses the development of a fast face recognition system for the Symbian mobile operating system using Local Binary Patterns (LBP). The process begins with face detection using the AdaBoost algorithm on images captured by the device's camera. Following detection, the faces undergo preprocessing, which includes finding the eyes, standardizing the geometry, and normalizing lighting conditions. A new, quick method for locating eyes, called Eyeball Search (ER), is introduced in this phase. The system then employs an enhanced version of LBP for the recognition task. Despite the limited computational resources of the Symbian platform, the system demonstrates commendable accuracy and processing speed, achieving recognition rates of about 87.78% while maintaining the ability to process approximately 2.5 images per second.

Face recognition technology is increasingly sought-after across a variety of sectors and its implementation on smartphones has generated considerable interest due to the ubiquity of digital cameras on these devices. The LBP method, initially devised for texture analysis, has been adapted to facial recognition. In this approach, the face image is partitioned into multiple blocks, and histograms of LBP codes for each are computed and concatenated to form a global description. Recognition is performed using a nearest-neighbor classifier based on the chi-square distance.

The paper also outlines a hierarchical multiscale approach with LBP, where the image is similarly divided into equal-sized blocks, and multiscale LBP features are extracted and assembled into a single histogram for the recognition phase. The classifier then uses the chi-square distance to determine the identity.

In summary, the paper presents a system that employs an effective combination of face detection algorithms, preprocessing techniques including eye detection, and LBP-based recognition to create a fast and reasonably accurate face recognition system for Symbian devices.
