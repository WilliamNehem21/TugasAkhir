In the context of the academic paper, the authors are discussing the conditions necessary for a particular inference rule to be considered valid, which is part of proving the soundness of a set of inference rules.

Paraphrased, the passage might read:

For an argument to be considered valid, a certain intermediate condition involving either the variable ‘x’ or ‘a’ would be necessary. Rule A1 should therefore include ‘x’ or ‘a’. However, because Rule C2 changes both variables, any condition applied to the parallel rule based on these would not be met.

Generally, the reliability of inference rules is established by confirming that the rules maintain truth across their applications. This means that as long as the premises are true and the supplementary conditions are met, the derived conclusion will also be true. Verifying the soundness involves a detailed analysis of each rule, extending previous methods by incorporating and adjusting the sets that depend on certain variables. The key steps in ensuring that the parallel rule and the rule that handles local resources are sound are briefly outlined, demonstrating the process of preserving validity.
