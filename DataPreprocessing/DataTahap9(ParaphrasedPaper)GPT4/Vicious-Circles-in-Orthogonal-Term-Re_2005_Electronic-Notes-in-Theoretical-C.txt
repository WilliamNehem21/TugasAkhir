In the paper, the authors dive into the distinctions between weak normalization (WN) and strong normalization (SN) within the context of first-order orthogonal rewriting systems. By leveraging the Erasure Lemma, they present a Pumping Lemma that sheds light on the nature of exceptional termsâ€”those that are weakly normalizing but not strongly normalizing. A significant outcome of their analysis is the conclusion that if an orthogonal term rewriting system (TRS) is weakly normalizing, then its finite reduction graphs do not contain any cyclic reductions. This serves as a foundational concept leading to the understanding that orthogonal TRSs with the WN property inherently do not permit cyclic reductions.

The authors focus on sub-TRSs, which are TRSs in their own right, particularly the reduction graph G(t) of a term t and the family F(t) of t. G(t) includes the term t and all its reducts, while F(t) encompasses t and all subterms of its reducts. Both G(t) and F(t) are subject to regular TRS notions and theorems such as confluence in orthogonal TRSs.

The proof section investigates what happens under the assumption that an orthogonal TRS named R contains a term t with infinite reductions but not expansions, and the sub-TRS family F(t) maintains the WN property. The proof aims to demonstrate the impossibility that t can avoid terms without normal forms within its family by showing that t must have an infinite ladder of reductions, indicating that F(t) does not, in fact, satisfy WN.

A separate proof then addresses the circumstances of a cyclic term t within R. Assuming that t's family F(t) lacks terms without normal forms and that F(t) is an orthogonal TRS with the WN property, a contradiction arises because, according to the paper's findings, F(t) should be acyclic. Therefore, the existence of a cyclic term under these conditions is contradictory.
