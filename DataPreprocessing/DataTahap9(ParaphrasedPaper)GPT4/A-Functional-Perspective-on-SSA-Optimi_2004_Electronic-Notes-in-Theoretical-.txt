This academic paper discusses the importance of Static Single Assignment (SSA) form in compiler optimization algorithms, which rely on data flow information to ensure the correctness of compilers. It is acknowledged that the SSA form is similar to lambda terms used in functional programming. Given the extensive research on formal reasoning frameworks for the lambda calculus, the authors propose that this connection can be utilized to enhance reasoning about compiler optimizations.

The authors introduce a new way to formalize the relationship between SSA form programs and a version of lambda terms known as Administrative Normal Form (ANF). They suggest that understanding this connection could improve our ability to analyze SSA-based optimization algorithms. To support this, they present an ANF-based version of a well-known SSA-based optimization algorithm for constant propagation under conditional statements.

Kelsey and Appel previously recognized a link between SSA form programs and lambda terms. The authors argue that exploiting this relationship could simplify the process of verifying the correctness of compiler optimizations, which traditionally depend on SSA form. They see their study as moving toward the advantages of using typed, functional languages at the intermediate stages of compiling traditional languages, which can help with ensuring the correctness of compiler optimizations, validating optimized code during compilation, and supporting certified binary generation.

The authors describe how they translate SSA form programs into ANF, where an entire program in SSA form is translated into an enclosing 'letrec,' a recursive binding construct in functional languages. Within this structure, each SSA block is converted into an ANF function, with the hierarchy represented by the dominator tree in the SSA being reflected in nested 'letrec' constructs in the ANF. This nesting allows for variable definitions to be visible according to the usual scope rules and creates new dynamic scopes with each translation of an SSA block. The variables retain their proper dominance relationships due to the scoping rules of ANF. If necessary, optimizations can further flatten the nested 'letrec' structure using lambda lifting techniques. The authors do not specify the exact constants used in the translation but note that they generally include integers, floating-point numbers, and machine opcodes. They also assume unique variables and labels for simplicity. 

In summary, the paper describes how leveraging the correspondence between SSA form and lambda terms can be employed to improve the reasoning about compiler optimizations by presenting a method to translate SSA form into ANF.
