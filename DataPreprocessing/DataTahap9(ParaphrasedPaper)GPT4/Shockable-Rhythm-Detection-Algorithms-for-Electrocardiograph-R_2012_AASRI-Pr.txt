The Threshold Crossing Intervals (TCI) algorithm determines the incidence and location of a signal's crossing through a set threshold. By setting a threshold value for 8-second ECG signals, a binary signal is generated based on whether the signal lies above or below this threshold. Each 3-second segment of the binary signal is then analyzed to calculate the TCI index, which helps differentiate between sinus rhythm (SR), ventricular tachycardia (VT), and ventricular fibrillation (VF).

The goal is to automate the detection of VF in cardiac devices; the method includes evaluating parameters such as triangular waveform components that represent heart function, the area under the waveform, and their ratio. These measures are used to ascertain the likelihood of VF based on cardiac waveform characteristics, thus improving detection sensitivity and specificity for arrhythmias in even complex heart function waveforms.

Building on the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) algorithm, Arafat et al. introduced a VF detection technique. This method extracts the first three Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) from ECG signals corresponding to normal sinus rhythm (NSR) and VF. It was observed that VF-IMFs are mutually orthogonal, unlike NSR-IMFs. Using the orthogonality measures, the EMD method effectively identifies VF within 3-second windows of digitized ECG data from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database.

Efficient algorithms capable of detecting life-threatening rhythms quickly are crucial for improving the success rate of emergency response. To this end, fast-performing algorithms like EMD that achieve high accuracy within 3-second intervals are valuable. Additionally, combining different algorithms could further enhance detection robustness. For instance, although primarily focused on rhythm detection in ICDs, incorporating multiple discriminators to classify cardiac rhythms, as suggested by the invention, may offer benefits in Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) as well.
