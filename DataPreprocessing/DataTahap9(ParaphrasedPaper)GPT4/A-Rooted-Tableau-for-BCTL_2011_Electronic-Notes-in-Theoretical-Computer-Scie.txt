The number of elements in the closure set is directly proportional to the length of the input formula. The quantity of hues increases at an exponential rate based on the size of the closure set, while the number of colors also rises exponentially with the quantity of hues. Rules are exclusively enforced on rule nodes, with each color corresponding to a maximum of one rule node. The computational complexity of each procedural step is polynomial in relation to the number of colors, which translates to an exponential relationship when considering the number of hues. Consequently, the BCTL*RTAB process is guaranteed to terminate in a time frame that is at most two exponential orders of magnitude greater than the formula's length.
