The academic paper discusses the impact of urbanization on land development and the associated challenges in managing urban floods. Due to people relocating for job opportunities and better services, urban areas are experiencing growing population densities, with the proportion of the global population living in urban areas having risen from 43% in 1990 to 55% in 2018, and an expected increase to 60% by 2030, as reported by the UN's World Urbanization Prospects 2018.

The densification of cities places stress on drainage systems and reduces the capacity of floodplains to manage surface runoff, leading to more frequent and extensive flood inundation. The accelerated flow of runoff into drainage systems can also intensify flooding. Economic damages from urban floods are projected to increase substantially, emphasizing the need for sustainable urban development.

The paper also examines the varied global interest in urban land and the complexities it creates for urban planners, with specific references to the business-driven demand for urban land and the Russian preference for rural properties over urban land. This diverse stakeholder interest complicates urban land development and flood management efforts, with floodwaters disregarding administrative boundaries.

Recognizing gaps in existing research, the authors conducted a systematic literature review to assess how stakeholder concerns are identified and incorporated into HydroGIS tools, which are used for water management in urban settings. They developed and refined an approval-granting use case through stakeholder engagement to classify concerns and determine how to integrate them into the GIS tool's development process.

The development process involved iterative prototyping and the combination of predictive and adaptive methodologies to align both hydrological models and user interface development. This was done with an emphasis on satisfying user needs through a process-centric approach.

The HydroGIS tool was applied to a case study in Colombo, Sri Lanka, and went through multiple rounds of stakeholder evaluations using structured questionnaires for feedback, enhancing its features with each iteration. One of the main developmental challenges was the tool's security feature, which initially received a 0% satisfaction rating from stakeholders and required several revisions.

The significant contribution of this study is the demonstration of methods for identifying, evaluating, incorporating, and verifying stakeholder concerns in the creation of HydroGIS tools. This paper highlights the need for the automation of input, process, and output requirements in decision-making tools, as it successfully implemented interactive features that allow both technical and non-technical users to evaluate, modify, and visualize hydrological and GIS data for better urban planning and flood management.
