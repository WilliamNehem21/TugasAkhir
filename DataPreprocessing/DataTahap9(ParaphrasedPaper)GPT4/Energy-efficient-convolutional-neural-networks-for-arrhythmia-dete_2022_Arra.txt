This academic paper discusses the development of energy-efficient hardware-implementable architectures for bandpass filters and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for arrhythmia detection in electrocardiogram (ECG) signals.

The paper describes a method to configure the parameters of seven biquad blocks in a second-order stage (SOS) architecture to achieve the desired bandpass filter transfer function. This high-order filter is particularly effective at suppressing baseline errors and noise. In preparation for hardware implementation, it's mentioned that the arrangement of the SOS must be adjusted to maintain reasonable amplitude levels throughout the filtering process.

For the CNN analysis side, the paper addresses the inadequacy of linear convolution in fully capturing the complexities of input signals. Activation functions are introduced as a means to provide non-linear mapping from one layer to the next. The use of multiple filters can significantly inflate the feature map dimensions, so pooling is employed to reduce this complexity by downsampling the information. These feature maps are processed through densely interconnected fully connected layers. Significant hyperparameters, such as the number of layers, kernel size, pooling size, and number of nodes in fully connected layers, are critical for optimizing network performance and learning capacity.

Regarding continuous arrhythmia classification, the paper states that using CNNs non-stop (like over 12 hours on a smartwatch) would be very energy-consuming. Instead, they recommend brief, periodic analysis (in this case, 7-second intervals) to efficiently determine the presence or absence of arrhythmia without having to analyze the entire 2-minute duration.

The paper also compares its proposed models to one by Chaur et al., which designed a 1D CNN with ten convolutional and pooling layers, followed by two fully connected layers and a softmax output. Their CNN had over 3.9 million parameters, which is 34,505 times more than the proposed model in this study.

The authors suggest energy-efficient recurrent CNN architectures for extended time series, aiming to detect atrial fibrillation in ECG signals with significantly fewer model parameters and energy consumption. Prioritizing energy usage as an evaluation metric facilitates the creation of models deployable on compact hardware devices.

The lightweight model presented comprises convolutional layers with 1, 2, and 2 filters, and one fully connected layer, totaling only 114 parameters. Following energy optimization, the model achieved 95.3% accuracy on a test set of 4,800 ECGs. By using this optimized classifier, energy consumption for 2-minute signal classification was cut by 81%. On average, only around 21 seconds (3.09 segments of 7 seconds each) of signal were needed to classify the full 112 seconds effectively. The study avoided errors stemming from segment-wise decisions by recurrently incorporating information from previous segments.
