Our findings indicate that a q-backbone coloring using 2q + 2 colors can be achieved in a linear timeframe. The optimality of our bound remains uncertain for triangle-free graphs G. When G contains triangles, the bound is obviously optimal; for example, a K4 (complete graph on four vertices) containing a K1,3 (star graph with four vertices and three edges) as a backbone demonstrates this. Consequently, we pose the following question regarding the tightness of our bound.

We have demonstrated that the coloring of graph G is indeed a circular backbone coloring. To confirm this, we need to show that a central vertex V and all of its neighbors on the backbone are properly colored. It is noted that vertex V is colored with either color 1, q + 3, or q + 2. In the situation where V is colored with 1, the allowable colors for its neighbors on the backbone are q + 1 or q + 2. If V is colored with q + 3, its neighbors must have the colors 1 or 2. Lastly, if V receives the color q + 2, its neighbors on the backbone are assigned colors 1 or 2q + 2. Therefore, it is concluded that we have a legitimate circular q-backbone coloring of (G, F).
