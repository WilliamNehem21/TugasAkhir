Distribution middleware, commonly provided as commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) solutions, plays a critical role in the infrastructure for essential, embedded, or large systems, yet these products often lack a thorough analysis of their behavior. In our study, we tackle the challenge by applying formal modeling to our middleware framework, PolyORB. We describe the effective use of various tools and methods like Petri nets, temporal logic, and innovative algorithms that curtail the problem of expansive state spaces to affirm the middleware's behavioral traits.

In the academic arena, formal modeling and middleware development are typically viewed as distinct specialties, often handled by different teams or at different stages in a project. Our goal is to blend these two fields, drawing from the wealth of experience at ENST in middleware development (with projects like GLADE and AdaBroker) and LIP6's expertise in applying formal methods, notably with the CPN-AMI tool-suite for Petri net analysis.

We combine proof-based techniques, adept at analyzing systems of an unbounded natureâ€”albeit demanding and challenging to automate, with model checking, which is suited for finite systems and lends itself to more automated and graphical approaches.

Investigating state classes under representative symmetries is remarkably efficient, as it's a structural Petri net feature and not tied to the state space size. Our symmetry-conscious synchronization method for products is conceived during runtime, dynamically adjusting relations based on the automaton arcs of the temporal logic formula.

In practice, we've managed to analyze properties even on a machine with just 512MB of memory, avoiding swapping, and observed a decrease in quotient graph growth. For example, with each additional thread, the growth rate declines, eventually plateauing when more threads no longer influence the system.

The verification success hinges on the arsenal of tools employed: CPN-AMI for initial modeling, GreatSPN for handling data type symmetries and reducing state space, and the SPOT library in tandem with GreatSPN for checking linear temporal logic (LTL) models. The seamless integration of these tools through CPN-AMI simplifies the complex interaction between them.

Our research marks a significant step in verifying and understanding middleware behavioral attributes, setting the stage for the development of a middleware that is both functionally distributed and verifiable through proof-based approaches. This necessitated enhancements to the middleware's architectural design to harmonize distribution functionality with the demands of behavioral verification.
