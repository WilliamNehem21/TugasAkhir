This paper discusses the challenges in determining whether partial models can be verified precisely, efficiently, and compositionally. The paper shows that this problem is as computationally hard as checking the validity of formulas in specific logics, as evidenced by matching complexity results. However, they can only establish that the decision problem lies within a complexity class that is exponentially higher, indicating a significant computational effort without pinpointing the precise difficulty level.

The study further examines the impact of the inherent precision loss when working with partial models and the properties of temporal logic formulas, acknowledging that while these formulas are usually short and might accommodate exponential size increases in practice, this does not resolve the question regarding exact computational complexity.

In Section 2, the paper gives background on the verification of partial systems. In Section 3, it presents technical results including the upper and lower bounds of complexity for decision problems regarding semantic minimizations in temporal logics.

The paper also touches upon related work, discussing the satisfaction semantics between pointed Kripke structures and formulas of propositional modal Âµ-calculus, refinement, generalized model checking, and validation. The paper clarifies that its results and proofs apply only to sentences, using notation that reflects these specific subsets of logical sentences.

Additionally, the authors refer to previous studies that have looked at partial-valued logics. Specifically, they cite work by Blamey on semantic minimizations and Van Fraassen's concept of supervaluational meaning, which underpins the generalized model checking approach in temporal logics. The paper also acknowledges that while some decision problems related to self-minimization in logic exhibit computational hardness, others do not show this property for any of the logics considered.

Furthermore, the paper identifies that certain problems related to propositional logic are confirmed to be NP-complete, implying that these problems are difficult but can be verified efficiently if a solution is provided.

Finally, the paper points out that for some logics, decision problems concerning optimistic and pessimistic self-minimization are as hard as their respective validity problems. It concludes that for propositional logic, the complexity of deciding optimistic and pessimistic self-minimization aligns with the complexity of validity, and the complexity class for formulas that are not self-minimizing corresponds to the satisfiability complexity.

The paper ends with a call for more research to determine the specific computational complexity of decision problems associated with semantic minimizations and highlights potential connections with recent work on the complexity of decisions for modal and mixed specifications.
