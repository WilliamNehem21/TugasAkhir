The field of convex polyhedra holds a pivotal role in numerical domains used for program analysis and verification. While it is often the most accurate choice for many applications, its tendency towards exponential complexity in worst-case scenarios has led researchers to seek simpler, more computationally efficient alternatives despite a trade-off in precision. Even so, advancements in implementation have made it possible to consider convex polyhedra a feasible option in certain cases.

The paper reviews existing strategies aimed at reducing computational resources while working with convex polyhedra and introduces new techniques aimed at improving their efficiency without compromising accuracy. These innovations are part of collaborative work in progress, with initial experiments showing promise in enhanced efficiency, as implemented within the Parma Polyhedra Library.

The paper proceeds by establishing foundational notation and concepts before discussing the double description method by Motzkin et al., which uses duality to relate the constraints and generator representations of polyhedra. The authors suggest optimizations, like domain wrappers and novel representation schemes, particularly for non-convex (NNC) polyhedra, to bypass common efficiency issues.

Initial experimental evaluations indicate significant efficiency improvements in benchmarks, including unexpected gains in certain tests. The paper concludes by underscoring the potential benefits of the new techniques and acknowledges the ongoing joint research efforts from various collaborators contributing to the ideas and content of the paper.
