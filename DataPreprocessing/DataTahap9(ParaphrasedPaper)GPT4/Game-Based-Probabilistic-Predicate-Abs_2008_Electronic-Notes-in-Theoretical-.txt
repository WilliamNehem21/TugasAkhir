The provided academic paper discusses the challenges and advances in abstracting Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), a mathematical framework used for modeling systems with both probabilistic and non-deterministic characteristics, such as communication and security protocols. Traditional approaches to manage the complexity of large MDPs involve generating lower and upper bounds on reachability probabilities by creating an abstraction at the model level, which can be limited by scalability issues.

This paper introduces a novel abstraction technique that operates at the language level, specifically utilizing the PRISM modeling language. It uses predicate abstraction and SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) solvers to construct game-based abstractions directly from high-level descriptions, which can handle complex systems more efficiently. The authors have advanced this method by creating a compositional framework that works with controlled Markov decision processes (CMDPs)â€”variants of MDPs that represent system components.

Instead of constructing full concrete CMDPs and then reducing them, the authors' approach detects valuations that lead to identical commands to increase efficiency. They compare their method to existing practical approaches and highlight its ability to verify larger systems and the advantages of a compositional strategy.

The authors present an implementation of their techniques using the SMT solver Yices and demonstrate the method's effectiveness through various case studies, showing that their work facilitates game-based abstractions for more extensive models than previously possible. They also aim to enhance their abstraction framework by incorporating symbolic decision procedures and developing an abstraction-refinement loop for MDP verification. Future work also includes extending their method to work with imperative programming languages.
