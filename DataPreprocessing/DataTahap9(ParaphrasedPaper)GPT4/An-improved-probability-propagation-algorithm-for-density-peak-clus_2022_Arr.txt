This paper discusses the development of an enhanced density peak clustering algorithm, known as DPC-PPNNN, which incorporates the concepts of natural nearest neighborhood and probability propagation. The new algorithm addresses the limitations of the original density peak clustering (DPC) by allowing for a nonparametric clustering process that is adaptable to more complex datasets. The performance of DPC-PPNNN is tested on various datasets and demonstrates superior results when compared to the original DPC, as well as other frequently used clustering methods such as k-means and DBSCAN.

Clustering is a method used to group data samples into clusters based on similarity measures. These clusters consist of data samples that are closely related within the same subset and distinctly separate from samples in other subsets. Clustering is vital in fields such as social sciences, biology, pattern recognition, and information retrieval, and has attracted significant research interest over time. A variety of clustering algorithms have been developed, each suited for different applications.

The paper also addresses the issue of accurately determining the number of clusters and their centers without overlooking the local structure of data, which can lead to missing clusters or the propagation of errors, especially with certain hierarchical clustering approaches. The automatic clustering algorithm proposed by Li, Ge, and Su is designed to determine cluster density by propagating through potential centers and recognizing all connected points as a cluster after multiple propagation rounds.

To evaluate the performance of different clustering algorithms, synthetic datasets with varying distributions, data point quantities, and cluster numbers are used. These synthetic datasets enable comparisons across different scenarios. It was noted that certain algorithms like k-means and DBSCAN struggle with specific datasets, such as the Cassini dataset, where they fail to identify uniform clusters or correctly allocate data points, while the DPC algorithm can locate cluster centers but not necessarily assign all points accurately.
