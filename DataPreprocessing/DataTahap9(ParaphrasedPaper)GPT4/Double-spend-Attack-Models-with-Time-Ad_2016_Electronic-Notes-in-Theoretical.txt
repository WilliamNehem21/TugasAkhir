The paper examines the risk of double-spend attacks in the Bitcoin network, where an attacker could manipulate the system to spend the same digital funds more than once. It challenges previous models by Satoshi Nakamoto and Meni Rosenfeld, which are based only on an attacker's hashing power. The paper presents new attack models that consider the time advantage an attacker might have from secretly mining fraudulent blocks or controlling the network.

Initially, the paper provides a technical background of the Bitcoin network, describing how users can conduct transactions using a distributed ledger known as the blockchain without the need for a trusted third party. It explains the process of "mining" where transactions are verified and new blocks are added to the chain, along with how Bitcoin balances are determined by tracing past transactions.

The main contribution of this paper is two new attack models: the Generalized Model and the Time-Based Model. The Generalized Model expands on Rosenfeld's hashrate-based attack model by incorporating a time advantage parameter for the attacker. The Time-Based Model, on the other hand, calculates the success probability of a double-spend attack by considering the timing of the last mined block by both honest and dishonest miners and their progress in mining.

Experimental results show that the new models can capture scenarios where an attacker's time advantage can lead to significant risks that were undetectable using the older models. This suggests that the inclusion of time into attack modeling is essential for accurately assessing the security of Bitcoin against double-spend attacks.

The paper indicates potential future work, such as proving the equivalence between the Generalized and Time-Based models, formally specifying these models in a mathematical language, and exploring their effectiveness compared to other attack types in the Bitcoin network.
