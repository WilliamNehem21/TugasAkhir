This academic paper discusses an approach to addressing the Ordered Decision Diagram (ODT) problem by representing it as a D-DNNF (deterministic Decomposable Negation Normal Form) graph labeled G'. The authors focus on the practical implications of the graph's size as it relates to the efficiency of the ODT computation. They propose a method to reduce the size of this graph, G', by considering that the primary interest lies in the model counts of the test vectors, rather than the actual observations themselves. They demonstrate that the graph G' can be effectively simplified by projecting it onto its input variables, computing the model counts at an earlier stage before they are lost in the projection process.

The paper further examines a subgraph, termed GS, which consists of several s-subgraphs. A significant point of analysis is determining which of these s-subgraphs should be included in GS, effectively asking which children of an OR node should be included in the graph structure. To guide these decisions, the authors define the concept of the "distinguishing ratio" for a node with multiple children in the graph.

Additionally, the authors provide an evaluation of their DNNF-based testing methodology through its application to a practical model - an automotive engine test-bed. The system under study includes three major components: an engine, a pipe, and a throttle. The purpose of using the methodology on this setup is to detect potential leaks in the pipe. This is achieved by manipulating three to four controllable variables and monitoring the outcomes through three to four measurable variables. To deal with the model's intrinsic complexity, the test-bed system has been discretized into varied instance sizes, with these discrete models being generated from the original mixed discrete-continuous model through different levels of abstraction, and by utilizing a conversion from Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP) to SAT (satisfiability) problems.
