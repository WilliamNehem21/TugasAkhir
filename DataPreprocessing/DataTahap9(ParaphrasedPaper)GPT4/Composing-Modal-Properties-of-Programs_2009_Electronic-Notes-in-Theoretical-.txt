This academic paper discusses the development and application of compositional verification techniques which are crucial when individual components of a system can interact with each other. These techniques are particularly relevant for mobile code, where new applications can be added to an existing system after its initial release.

The paper is divided into several sections:

Section 2 provides a summary of previous findings related to program architecture and behavior, logic, and the concept of a maximal model, while also introducing important terminology and symbols.

Section 3 focuses on explaining how to translate formulas from behavioral modal simulation logic to structural formulas, and it validates the accuracy of this method.

Section 4 demonstrates the reliability (soundness) and adequacy (completeness) of a compositional verification principle that applies to behavioral attributes that lack disjunctions, as long as local assumptions are described by behavioral modal simulation logic.

Section 5 discusses conclusions and future directions for this line of research.

The authors employ a subset of modal logic as their specification language, which they refer to as simulation logic due to its characteristic that formulas can be described through simulation. Specifically, they work with modal simulation logic, defined with labels and atomic propositions.

The paper abstracts from data, defining applet structure by its call graphs. Method specifications, which can include return points with outgoing edges, are considered a part of the general specification concept. The structural formula characterization of behavioral properties, however, is accurate only for "clean" appletsâ€”those without outgoing edges from return points. The paper discusses a "cleaning" operation that yields a clean applet preserving behavioral properties.

The concept of reachability is vital for the correctness proof of the structural formula characterization, which aligns with the fulfillment of box formulas in clean applets.

This research can only demonstrate soundness within their modal simulation logic subset. To achieve completeness in the full simulation logic, they utilize characteristic formulas and the necessity of greatest fixed-points for models containing loops.

The paper describes the process of converting behavioral properties to structural properties for modal simulation logic, which only allows for box modalities. The authors build upon prior work establishing a compositional verification principle based on structural local properties. They discuss the method's efficacy through an industrial case study and note that the translation from behavioral properties extends the applicability of their compositional verification principle.

This translation is done through symbolic execution, where each modality in a behavioral formula produces a constraint on the structures that fulfill it. This procedure has been implemented in OCaml and incorporated into their toolkit.

In summary, the paper contributes to the field of compositional verification by offering a method to verify behavioral properties of systems that can be dynamically extended with new applications, ensuring that such systems maintain desired functionality and security.
