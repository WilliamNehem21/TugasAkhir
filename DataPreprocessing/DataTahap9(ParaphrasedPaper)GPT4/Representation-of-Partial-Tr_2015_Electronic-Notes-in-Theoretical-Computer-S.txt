The concept of trace in the context of monoidal categories is utilized to offer a unified categorical perspective on phenomena found across diverse disciplines, including linear algebra, topology, knot theory, and proof theory. In this general setting, the trace operation is interpreted as a kind of feedback mechanism.

To accommodate scenarios where the trace cannot always be computed, the notion of partially traced categories was introduced. Research has indicated that any partially traced category can, in fact, be viewed as a subset within a fully traced category. The paper presents an alternative proof of this embedding theorem, employing a novel approach that differs from the original proof. Despite the different methodology, both constructions fulfill the same universal property, leading to their natural isomorphism.

The paper's Section 3.2 and Section 4.1 detail how the original partially traced category can be faithfully incorporated into a new, proposed quotient category. This incorporation is such that the partial trace structure is preserved in the embedding. Then, in Section 4.2, it is proved that this new construction possesses the anticipated universal property.
