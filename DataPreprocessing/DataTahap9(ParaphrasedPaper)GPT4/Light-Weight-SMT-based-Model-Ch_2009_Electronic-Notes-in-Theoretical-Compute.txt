The first element of (i) could be replaced with the concept of local finiteness, though the second element generally holds true in scenarios where the structures being modeled are concrete entities such as various kinds of finite mathematical structures (e.g. sets, linear orders, graphs, or forests). The original text assumed quantifier elimination for TE to establish that the system is closed under the operation of taking pre-images, but in our approach, such an assumption is unnecessary because we are working with a narrower definition of what constitutes a T-formula.

Further, it is of note when we discuss our framework for characterizing parameterized systems within the stopping failures model, as introduced in section 2. Specifically, we consider the particular state qcrash, which serves as a halt state where no further transitions are enabled. This provides the basis for an intuitive method to define conditions of activity in such systems by asserting that the activity condition holds as long as the system state is different from qcrash.
