Advancements in agricultural management have significantly improved with the integration of technology, yielding more efficient practices, as outlined by Rao and Sridhar (2018). These innovations include advanced simulation models, precision field monitoring, and data analytics.

Furthermore, Deep Learning (DL) models, which involve complex structures with multiple layers, have proven more effective than traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) in predicting watershed biochemical oxygen demand and total phosphorus, following a comparative study. Khaki and Wang (2019) further demonstrated that Deep Neural Networks (DNN), when compared to Shallow Neural Networks (SNN), offer superior performance in forecasting crop yields.

A forecasting model was developed using the Angstr√∂m-Prescott equation for weekly solar radiation prediction, and a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm was applied to model long-term precipitation patterns.

This research considered environmental variables such as precipitation, irrigation, maximum and minimum temperatures, and solar radiation over a 200-day growth period, introducing 800 variables for modeling. With 100 climate scenarios and 100,000 irrigation scenarios, a yield-generating crop model was created, producing 10 million records of maize yields. Climate variability data were generated using weather generators.

Accurate crop modeling relies heavily on daily environmental data, with a year's worth of field data providing the foundation for weather scenario generation. Adjusting for daily variations, average monthly temperature, solar radiation, and precipitation data, collected from local weather stations, were disaggregated using a stochastic tool to closely simulate the study area's climate using a 30-year historical dataset.

The DSSAT (Decision Support System for Agro-Technology Transfer) model simulates crop growth, development, and yield influenced by soil, weather, and plant dynamics and is widely employed by a range of stakeholders across the globe. In the current study, a maize irrigation experiment was calibrated in DSSAT using historical data from an irrigation research park.

The DNN model trained on this data featured a range of hidden layers with different configurations of neurons, using the tanh activation function in hidden layers and the softmax function in the output layer. Principle component analysis (PCA) was employed to reduce the data complexity using feature extraction, implemented through a Python library.

The study explored simpler yet accurate DL models by comparing variable reduction methods, including Bayesian variable selection, Spearman rank correlation, and PCA. Bayesian selection emerged as the most robust technique, although time-intensive, while Spearman correlation provided similar accuracy. Models based on PCA showed high accuracy in training but less during testing.

In conclusion, these advanced modeling techniques, coupled with comprehensive weather and agricultural data, offer a sophisticated approach for optimizing crop yield predictions, aiding decision-making at various scales in agriculture.
