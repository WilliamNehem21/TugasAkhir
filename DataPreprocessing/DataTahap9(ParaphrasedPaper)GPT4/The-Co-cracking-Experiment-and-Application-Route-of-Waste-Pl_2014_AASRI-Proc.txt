The prevalence of waste plastics has become a serious environmental hazard, prompting countries worldwide to create legislation aimed at mitigating this threat to the survival of human beings and the planet. These legislations focus on various methods to manage waste plastics, including landfilling, incinerating, and recycling. Recycling itself is categorized into mechanical and chemical processes. Mechanically recycled plastics are repurposed into new or lower-grade plastic products, while chemically recycled plastics undergo cracking reactions to be converted into chemical raw materials or fuels.

The process of chemically converting waste plastics into liquid fuels involves a series of steps beginning with heating and stirring the materials while ensuring appropriate cooling measures. As the temperature rises, the cracking reaction intensifies and pressure increases. At a certain pressure, the needle valve is opened to vent the oil gas, which passes through air and water cooling, followed by measuring the resulting non-condensable gases and purifying through alkali washing. The reaction is maintained at target temperatures for one hour before ceasing heating. Stirring continues until the temperature drops to 200째C, then the power is disconnected. Once the temperature falls to 50째C, the resultant oil and residual carbon from the coking reaction are extracted and weighed. Throughout the experiment, temperature and pressure changes are recorded, and the reaction conditions are observed at different temperatures. The liquid product is collected, weighed, and distilled into light oil (fraction below 200째C) and heavy oil (fraction above 200째C) for additional analysis and property studies.
