In this study, the authors present an advanced image denoising technique that employs a nonlinear thresholding function, along with an adaptive Bayesian threshold, in the Nonsubsampled Contourlet Transform (NSCT) domain. This approach is designed to address the limitations associated with using a uniform threshold across all sub-bands. By estimating the noise levels for the various sub-bands based on the NSCT coefficients of different directions and scales, the method can adaptively determine individual thresholds for each sub-band using Bayesian inference. Upon establishing these thresholds, a specially selected nonlinear thresholding function is applied to mitigate the problems inherent to both soft and hard thresholding approaches. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method more efficiently removes Gaussian white noise and achieves higher peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) values. Furthermore, it preserves the texture and detail of the images more effectively, leading to an improved visual quality.
