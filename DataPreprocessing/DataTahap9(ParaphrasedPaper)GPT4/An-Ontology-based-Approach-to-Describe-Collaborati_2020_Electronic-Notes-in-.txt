The academic paper is structured as follows:

- *Introduction*: Section 2 introduces the various types of users and the competency questions (CQs) that they may have.
- *Ontology Components*: Section 3 discusses the key components of the ontology.
- *CQ Responses*: Section 4 provides the responses to the CQs.
- *Implicit Information*: Section 5 outlines the implicit information that can be inferred from the ontology.
- *Conclusion*: Section 6 wraps up the paper with a summary and looks forward to potential areas for future research.

To model the second level of the ontology's class hierarchy, data properties such as a user's name, surname, or gender, as well as the title and date of a poster, are utilized. The ontology incorporates data properties to handle interoperability issues related to implementing the OAI-PMH protocol and the Dublin Core (DC) metadata elements, mapping them to XML schema datatypes or RDF literals.

The ontology is straightforward because it simply adds semantic layers to a specific dataset from an information repository (IR), enabling the representation of CQs and their answers using the ontology's own terms. Before the final release, all inconsistencies have been addressed. To ensure logical consistency, reasoning tools like HermiT and Pellet have been employed. The ontology is also capable of being expressed in various semantic web languages such as RDF or OWL (Web Ontology Language).

Ontologies like the one presented in this paper can reveal data inconsistencies, for instance, by enforcing cardinality constraints that determine the allowed number of authors per poster. This type of ontology can be adapted to represent collaborative efforts for various types of documents based on the needs of different users.

The paper leverages a set of CQs, which are addressed using the ontology's vocabulary, both in natural language and formal formats. Natural language answers are saved as definitions in RDF, while formal responses are derived from dialogues within the Protégé ontology editor. Using ontology information, reasoning tools can deduce new knowledge and spot potential inconsistencies in data from IRs, adding value to the data.
