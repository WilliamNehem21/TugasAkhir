To expand the utilization of distillers' hops and preserve their inherent nutrients and properties, a study investigated the effects of varying inlet and outlet temperatures, along with sample concentration, on product yield and rehydration rate. These variables were analyzed using an orthogonal design, quadratic polynomial stepwise regression, and response surface methodology. The study found that optimal spray drying conditions were achieved with an inlet temperature of 162°C, outlet temperature of 84°C, and sample concentration of 3.4g/200ml. Additionally, setting the feed temperature to 70-80°C, fan power to 95%, and fluid flow rate to 0.25l/h resulted in a product yield of 56.432% and a rehydration rate of 183.647%.

China, known as a leading beer producer, generates over 20 million tons of distillers' hops annually, which are by-products high in nutrients but prone to rapid spoilage due to their moisture content. Spray drying presents an efficient method for processing these by-products, offering benefits like rapid drying, large surface area, high product quality, and minimal loss of active ingredients.

The study's experimentation involved conditioning the distillers' hops in a Buchi B-290 laboratory spray dryer, following the single factor experiment. Post drying, the sample's rehydration rate was assessed using centrifuge tubes, emphasizing the yield and rehydration properties as key concerns.

Data was meticulously analyzed with DPS software, leading to the development of mathematical models to optimize the process conditions by predicting yields and rehydration rates. The models were confirmed to be accurate and reliable. Furthermore, the examination of response surfaces revealed that the main factors studied did not interact significantly. These findings demonstrated that under the optimal conditions mentioned, the experimental results could be reliably replicated.

The research received funding from the Sichuan Provincial Department of Education and the Science & Technology Project of Sichuan University of Science & Engineering. China Resources Snow Breweries (Zigong) Co., Ltd. was acknowledged for providing the distillers' hops used in the study.
