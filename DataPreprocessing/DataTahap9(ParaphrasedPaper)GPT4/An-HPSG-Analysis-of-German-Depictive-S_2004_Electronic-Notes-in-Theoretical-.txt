The German data demonstrates that depictive secondary predicates have the ability to relate to a variety of grammatical roles, such as subjects, direct objects, indirect objects, and even oblique complements. This correlation shows a certain degree of markedness that aligns with the obliqueness hierarchy previously outlined by Keenan, Comrie, and others.

I propose that depictive secondary predicates should be analyzed similarly to control constructions rather than raising constructions. This is because depictives can reference arguments that may not be overtly expressed, thus necessitating an analysis that considers the deeper argument-structure representation.

Within coherent constructions, we observe references to both the subject of an embedded verb (such as "schlafen") and to the subject and object of the main verb (such as "raten"). In contrast, incoherent constructions allow references only to elements associated with their respective coherence fields. There are instances where a depictive predicate can refer to an element without it being overtly mentioned in the sentence.

German data, as noted by Haider, suggests that a depictive element cannot refer to a dative noun phrase (NP) because the dative is deemed a lexical case, while NP subjects in German have structural case.

Sentences exhibit better references to dative NPs when there is no confounding nominative candidate present, and this is further supported when world knowledge negates the possibility of reference to a nominative NP.

Passive sentences also show this pattern. For example, if the subject "police officer" cannot be the referent due to world knowledge, then the only logical antecedent for a depictive predicate is the NP within a prepositional phrase.
 
Winkler's assumption that depictive predicates are adjuncts is supported by evidence from the ways depictive predicates can be ordered within a sentence and the flexibility in the number of depictive predicates allowed per clause. These predicates can independently serialize from their antecedents, showing no restrictions in their distribution within a clause.

Depictive predicates cannot refer to an expletive nominal complement, as this would break the condition on referentiality. Nonetheless, sentences with expletive subjects can have depictives, provided they do not refer to the expletive element itself.

The standard HPSG approach to coordination (which requires identical 'cat' values for coordinated elements) struggles to accommodate sentences with arguments of differing lengths within their argument-structure lists. Thus, coordination may fail in such cases.

An alternative approach is considering adjuncts as complements, incorporating them into the subcategorization list of the head they modify. This would allow for depictive predicates and the verbs they modify to combine before the completion of arguments. However, there is a debate around this approach and rejection in some discussions regarding depictives.
