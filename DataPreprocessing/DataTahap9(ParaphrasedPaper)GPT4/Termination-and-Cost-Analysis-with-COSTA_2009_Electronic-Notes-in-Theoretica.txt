The paper introduces COSTA, a static analyzer for assessing the cost and termination properties of Java bytecode programs. Cost analysis aims to estimate the potential resource consumption of a program statically, with a focus on a specific resource. Termination analysis strives to demonstrate that a program will eventually complete its execution for any given input.

COSTA is accessible via a command-line interface, allowing users to interact with the analyzer through various switches to configure its options. This design also supports the creation of additional user interfaces.

The web interface of COSTA provides an interactive platform for users to evaluate the system using predefined examples or to analyze their own Java source code or bytecode, which they can upload as .class or .jar files. The web interface caters to users with two distinct operational modes to tailor the behavior of the analyzer with its extensive set of options.

The paper exemplifies a cost model within COSTA that focuses on the number of method calls, specifically analyzing an upper limit of calls to the send(message tmsg) method within the commandAction method in a mobile device case. COSTA computes that the send method is called at most once during execution, as expected.

Although the exact cost of calls to a factorial function cannot be statically determined due to the indeterminate value of x.elem, the paper notes that COSTA can still certify the termination of the two associated methods. This is achieved by identifying an appropriate ranking function. Detailed explanations of COSTA's handling of termination issues are available in the technical sections of the paper.
