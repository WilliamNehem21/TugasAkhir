The selection of an equivalence ratio (ER) is critical during the oxygen-enriched pyrolysis process as it influences the composition and energy content of the resulting gas products. A suitable ER can also enhance gas quality due to a rise in oxygen concentration within a specific range.

Solid waste can be categorized as either general or hazardous. General solid waste includes municipal solid waste (MSW), which is produced from urban living activities and associated services, and can be in solid, semi-solid, or liquid form. Current practices for handling MSW are primarily landfilling, partial recovery, fermentation, and thermal processing. Thermal processing of MSW is favored in many developed countries because it is highly efficient, significantly reduces waste volume, provides energy recovery, and requires less land compared to other methods. Thermal processing technologies include incineration and pyrolysis; incineration is the older and more established method, while pyrolysis is a newer technology.

During the pyrolysis of MSW, organic components are distilled into gases such as methane (CH4) within the dry distillation layer. The water-gas shift reaction and CO2 reduction primarily occur at the carbon materials layer, while waste carbon oxidation happens in the oxide layer, resulting in gases mainly composed of CO, H2, and various hydrocarbons. The high temperatures in the pyrolysis device dry and dehydrate the MSW to prepare it for further decomposition.

The theoretical temperature for oxygen-enriched pyrolysis of MSW can be calculated by considering the heat released from combustion products during gasification, but actual furnace temperatures will be lower than the theoretical calculations. Using air as the oxidant reduces the furnace temperature due to the introduction of excess cold air and inert nitrogen, resulting in heat loss and excessive smoke emissions. Additionally, unreacted O2 and inert N2 remain in the produced gases.

As oxygen concentration increases, there is a substantial increase in the heat value of the gas product due to higher combustible gas production and reduced nitrogen levels. However, the energy content of gasification products decreases with an increase in ER, particularly when the ER surpasses 0.30, because of higher CO2 levels and lower CO and CH4 concentrations. When the ER exceeds a certain threshold (ER=0.25), the H2 content starts to drop sharply, leading to a rapid decline in the heat value of the gas products.
