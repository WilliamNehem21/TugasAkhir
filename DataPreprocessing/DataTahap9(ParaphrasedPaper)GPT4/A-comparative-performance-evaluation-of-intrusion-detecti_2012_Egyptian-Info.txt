This paper examines the rapid growth of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and their widespread applications in areas such as military, environment monitoring, healthcare, and home automation. Given the security vulnerabilities inherent in WSNs, especially due to their remote and often unsupervised deployment, the paper focuses on intrusion detection systems (IDS) as a key defensive strategy. It specifically explores anomaly-based IDS solutions for hierarchical WSNs.

By reviewing and contrasting various anomaly-based IDS systems, the paper highlights their respective strengths and weaknesses. The evaluation is based on two sets of critical metrics: performance-related metrics and security-related metrics. The performance metrics include computational and communication overhead, as well as workload distribution across the network. Security metrics assess the IDS's ability to safeguard the network.

Several techniques are explored in the paper. One involves using fuzzy C-means clustering to detect routing attacks based on abnormal data flow patterns. Another utilizes a combination of discrete wavelet transform and Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) neural networks for anomaly detection, leveraging the SOM's feature extraction capabilities with reduced data input. Furthermore, the paper discusses a technique employing Support Vector Machines (SVM) trained locally at each IDS node, with support vectors combined and redistributed among neighboring nodes for a global detection strategy.

The paper concludes that due to the nature of WSNs and their irregular traffic patterns, it is challenging to distinguish between normal and anomalous behavior. Therefore, data mining and artificial intelligence techniques are recommended for their dynamic pattern recognition and clustering abilities. Feature selection and clustering parameter optimization are also identified as critical factors influencing IDS performance.

Future research directions include the design of new anomaly-based IDS systems that balance performance and security, the exploration of advanced feature selection methods, and the use of innovative data mining technologies instead of traditional neural network classifiers to improve clustering parameter selection and the decision-making process in IDS.
