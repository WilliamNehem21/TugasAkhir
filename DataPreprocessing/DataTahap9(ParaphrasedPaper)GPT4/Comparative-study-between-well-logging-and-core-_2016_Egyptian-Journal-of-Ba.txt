This study builds upon previous research to examine the petrophysical properties of the Hawaz Formation in the H Oil Field, with a particular focus on the quick look assessment of log curves and establishing crossplots to correlate various petrophysical parameters, all of which are then validated against core sample data. The investigation incorporated several types of data:

- Geological data: Illustrated by composite logs.
- Well log data: Included measurements of resistivity, sonic, neutron, density, spontaneous potential, caliper, gamma ray, and natural gamma ray spectrometry, sourced from Repsol Oil.

H Oil Field's petroleum system features the structural Hawaz paleo-high, which emerged from post-Hawaz erosional processes. The primary regional cap for this system is the Silurian Tanezzuft shale formation, with the basal Tanezzuft hot shale member serving as the principal source rock in the study area. The Middle Ordovician Hawaz Formation is identified as the main reservoir rock. Informally, the formation is divided into eight horizons, labeled H1 through H8, with further subdivision into sub-units as needed. These horizons each display distinct petrophysical characteristics.
