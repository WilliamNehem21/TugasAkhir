In this academic paper, the authors investigate various indexes for achieving high accuracy in MRI segmentation when applied with Kernel Fuzzy C-Means (KFCM) and Spatial Kernel Fuzzy C-Means (SKFCM) algorithms. The focus is not to enhance the segmentation accuracy through kernel function modifications but to identify the best indexes for effective segmentation using KFCM and SKFCM.

The authors replace the standard Euclidean distance in the traditional FCM algorithm with a Gaussian Radial Basis Function (GRBF) induced kernel, enhancing robustness and generalizing FCM methods. They derive KFCM and SKFCM algorithms based on the Gaussian RBF kernel and apply them to images, testing eighteen different indexes to estimate the optimal number of clusters for the best image structure representation. These indexes range from classical to recent ones, assessing their performance in clustering validity within image segmentation, particularly in medical imaging.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses kernel methods, Section 3 reviews criteria for determining cluster numbers, Section 4 presents experimental comparisons, and Section 5 concludes the findings.

In their experiments, they test popular indexes like I, FHV (Fuzzy Hypervolume), and AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) on synthetic images and apply standard FCM and SKFCM methods to T1-weighted MR phantom images with different noise levels.

Their findings suggest that, on synthetic images, AIC, I, and FHV indexes are able to identify the true number of clusters, but FHV performs better with KFCM than SKFCM. AIC emerges as the most robust index and is particularly recommended for determining the correct number of clusters using KFCM and SKFCM in MRI images.

The tests show that the recent SKFCM method coupled with the AIC index can achieve good segmentation performance: up to 90% on synthetic images and up to 80% on MRI images.

The authors suggest further research, including additional tests on various real datasets across different domains, consideration of systematic and random noise levels, and the employment of a wider range of validity indexes to improve automatic clustering algorithms, in collaboration with specialists in the respective application fields.
