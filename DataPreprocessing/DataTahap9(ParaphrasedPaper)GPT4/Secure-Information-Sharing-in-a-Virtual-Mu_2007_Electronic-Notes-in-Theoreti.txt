The academic paper you provided outlines the importance of coordination, collaboration, and information sharing among various government, state, and local agencies for effective homeland security. It emphasizes that due to the sensitive nature of information involved, sharing must be secure and relevant. The agencies mainly use web technologies, often choosing XML to format shared data.

To manage crises, ad-hoc virtual response teams (VMART) are set up with members from different agencies and sectors, whose composition can change depending on the crisis's nature and location. As situations evolve, these teams must adapt by modifying their makeup, sometimes across state lines, such as from New York to New Jersey.

A system of role creation is necessary for effective inter-agency collaboration within a VMART. For instance, if the New York Fire Department (NYFD) needs the help of the New Jersey Fire Department (NJFD), it might create a new role for NJFD within the existing VMART setup, in accordance with specific role creation policies.

Different agencies need access to different parts of a shared XML document based on their functions - for example, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) might need to access the injury data while the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) requires information on the explosion profile. The paper discusses a document encryption scheme and key generation to facilitate such selective access.

The Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model is proposed as a suitable framework, where permissions are connected with roles and users are given roles that match their responsibilities. A two-tier RBAC system is suggestedâ€”one for inter-agency level collaborations across the VMART and another for intra-agency level access.

The paper outlines modifications to the traditional RBAC to suit the dynamic nature of VMART, allowing for the creation of new roles via a coordinator web service. At the inter-agency level, an agency's coordinator web service manages role permissions and the creation of new roles. At the intra-agency level, it oversees role permission assignments within the agency. Access to information is through "read" access for assigned roles, while the ability to create roles is provided through "create" access to agency coordinators.

Role permissions and creation operate under targeted constraints, called Role Permission Assignment Constraints (RPACs), which are pairs specifying the link between roles and the permissions they have to read certain XML schema objects.

Future work suggested in the paper includes integrating RBAC policies from different agencies into a unified control policy and developing a semantic interface for policy description to mitigate the issues stemming from heterogeneity and semantic differences between organizations. This includes pursuing ontology mapping and linking techniques to address the semantic variances in organizational structures and the documents they generate, thereby improving inter-agency resource sharing and policy enforcement.
