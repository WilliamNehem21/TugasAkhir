The academic paper discusses advanced topics in the field of category theory. Specifically, it explores the relationship between simulations and oplax transformations, a connection previously noted by the mathematician Hermida. In the fourth section, the paper delves into the main focus, presenting an innovative model structure for the category of 2-categories ('2-Cat'). Here, a simulation is defined in terms of a right homotopy. The paper suggests that readers who are not yet familiar with model category theory might benefit from reviewing foundational materials, such as the initial chapters of a recommended text, to better understand the terminology used. Further on, in the fifth section, the discussion is extended to cover cubical sets and cubical 2-categories. The sixth section offers concluding thoughts on the subject matter and outlines the implications of the research findings.
