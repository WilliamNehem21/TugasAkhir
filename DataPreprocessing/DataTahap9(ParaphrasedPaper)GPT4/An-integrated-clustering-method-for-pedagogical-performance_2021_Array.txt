The pursuit of high-quality education is a common goal shared by learners, educational institutions, and countries around the globe, according to Pumilia and Meusburger. The United Nations underscores the significance of quality education as a cornerstone for achieving sustainable development, which in turn leads to better standards of living, as well as fostering innovation and creativity. In today’s data-rich era, the abundance and complexity of data present both obstacles and opportunities. Academic settings, characterized by diverse student populations studying a variety of subjects across different levels, generate vast and intricately interlinked sets of data. Researchers are continuously faced with determining the nature, volume, and velocity of this big data.

A key aim of this academic paper is to forge collaborative efforts among educators and researchers to identify and understand various factors within interdisciplinary studies. The intention is that this effort will be beneficial to the Center for Higher Education Data and Statistics (CHEDS), an organization that gathers crucial educational data for the Ministry of Education (MOE). CHEDS uses this information to inform evidence-based decision-making, which influences policies and strategic planning in higher education, both at institutional and national levels. The outcome is to bolster the position and performance of the educational sector in a highly competitive global environment for higher education. Analytical reports stemming from this research are expected to enhance student learning experiences and inform curriculum development.

The paper highlights the use of "merged clusters as exemplars," which maximize average similarities within data. Through repeated sampling and validation processes, the research aims to deepen the understanding of what factors drive the formation of these data clusters. The next section of the paper is set to explain the details of “propagated clustering” and the mechanics of its implementation through "Algorithm 1."

The paper focuses on the potential for Big Data modelling to align with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.
