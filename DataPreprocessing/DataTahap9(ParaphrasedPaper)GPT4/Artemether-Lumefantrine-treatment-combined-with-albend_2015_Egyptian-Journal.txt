The paper discusses the significant global health burden caused by parasitic infections affecting over 200 million people, which can lead to chronic inflammation, cancer, and death. In particular, protozoan and helminthic infections like malaria, schistosomiasis, lymphatic filariasis, and others are prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions and contribute to substantial human and wildlife morbidity and mortality, with millions of deaths occurring annually, especially among children.

The study emphasizes concerns over the widespread use of mass drug administration (MDA) to eliminate these infections and the potential harmful side effects of such interventions, including liver damage, bone marrow toxicity, carcinogenesis, and developmental anomalies. The paper examines drugs commonly used in MDA, such as artemether-lumefantrine (A-L), ivermectin (IVR), and albendazole (ABZ), noting that while they are considered safe at therapeutic doses, they can cause significant toxicity in cases of overdose or interaction.

The toxicity of these drugs is investigated in the liver and bone marrow of mammalian systems, as these organs are critical for drug detoxification and blood cell proliferation, respectively. The study finds that administering combinations of these drugs can lead to oxidative stress, liver dysfunction, and bone marrow toxicity due to the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS).

Using a bone marrow micronucleus test, the paper reports increased DNA damage in rats treated with these drug combinations, linking the toxicity to an imbalance between ROS and antioxidant systems, resulting in increased lipid peroxidation and cell membrane damage.

The liver, central to drug detoxification, was found to be particularly susceptible to damage, with increased levels of liver enzymes indicating hepatocellular injury. Histological analyses confirmed the occurrence of hepatic necrosis and inflammation in rats treated with drug combinations.

Finally, the paper suggests that oxidative stress plays a crucial role in inducing abnormal cellular functions and diseases, as shown by the elevated levels of ROS and the co-occurrence of necrosis, inflammation, and other pathological changes in the liver, as well as DNA damage in the bone marrow cells. The findings underscore the importance of considering the potential negative effects of MDA strategies and highlight the need for further research on drug-induced toxicity and its mechanisms.
