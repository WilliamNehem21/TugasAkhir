In this research, the authors investigate a variety of techniques for detecting safety errors within systems, arguing that a combination of complementary methods is more beneficial than seeking the best singular technique. They examine a spectrum of error detection techniques, from explicit model checking to state space sampling.

Key contributions include:

- Implementation and assessment of nine different error detection techniques applied to a large benchmark set, marking the first comparison of such a number of diverse methods.
- Evaluation of the techniques based on their error detection capability, length of counterexamples provided, and the degree of model coverage achieved, with a focus on how these techniques complement each other.

The study detailed:

- The underlying principles of various error detection techniques and the specifics of those employed in the experiments.
- The presentation of an artificial example illustrating the complementary nature of these techniques.
- The provision of a web resource containing implementation details, models, properties verified, and all experimental results, using the DIVINE verification environment.

Experimental findings highlighted the complementary aspect of the techniques in terms of performance across different models and metrics such as state visits, counterexample lengths, and model coverage.

Notably:
- The DIRG and UPOR techniques (both BFS-based) generally produced shorter counterexamples without a trade-off between performance and the counterexample length.
- No single technique dominated; each shined in different scenarios and failed in others. Success varied depending on the coverage metrics and differed from their performance in error detection.

The authors conclude that:
- No single technique is universally superior, and many can run in parallel without communication overhead due to computing resources like multi-core processors and clusters, utilizing the strengths of each.
- It's more beneficial to employ multiple complementary techniques rather than perfecting a single one.
- The performance of certain techniques on specific verification problems greatly outpaced others, suggesting some problems are less sensitive to the choice of technique, while others are significantly impacted.

Future work aims to explore the potential benefits of sharing information between techniques during parallel runs and to implement globally controlled parallel runs using the discussed methods.
