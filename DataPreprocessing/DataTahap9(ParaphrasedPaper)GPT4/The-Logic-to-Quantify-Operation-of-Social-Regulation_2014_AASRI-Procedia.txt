The paper discusses the necessity of focusing on social regulatory fields to enhance regulatory efficiency through cost-benefit analysis. As cited by Robert W. Hahn (2006), the first cost-benefit report from the U.S. Office of Management and Budget showed that in 1997, regulations cost $198 billion but generated $298 billion, leading to a net benefit of $100 billion. The analysis reveals that evaluating the social costs and benefits of regulation is a complex task which must account for social justice and sustainable development, not merely a comparison of costs and benefits.

Moreover, accurate assessment of coal reserves is vital for determining the reasonable sale price of state-owned mineral deposits and preventing state property loss. China lacks data on water pollution from coal mining, complicating tax rule development regarding the external damage caused by mining activities.

Protection of property rights depends on both private and collective efforts, including state power. In some places, consumer interests are repeatedly compromised, despite existing consumer protection laws.

Opportunity costs, as described by Samuelson, are inherent in social regulation. They represent the value of the best alternative when choosing between scarce resources.

The paper suggests that regulatory benefits should exceed costs within a certain range (denoted as k1 to k2). This provides economic actors with surplus benefits beyond mere compliance, offering additional rewards for accepting regulation. If the benefits of non-compliance surpass this range, laws should enforce penalties.

The information environment is critical as transaction costs, while unavoidable, can be mitigated by transparent information. However, the complexity of reality renders media information regulation imperfect, requiring complementary approaches like case law. For instance, the U.S. Times-Sullivan rule has been debated on the grounds that it may promote irresponsible media behavior.
