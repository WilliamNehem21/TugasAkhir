Neoplasms, or abnormal tissue growths, can be either benign—which means noncancerous and typified by slow growth, distinct boundaries, and no invasion—or malignant, signifying cancerous growths that are fast-growing with unclear borders and the capability to invade nearby tissues and potentially spread to other body parts.

The study's dataset categorized patients into four groups based on their last known status: alive without cancer, alive with cancer, death due to cancer, and death with unspecified causes. Researchers focused on those who died of cancer 12-24 months post-diagnosis. They identified patients without cancer or with cancer 12-36 months post-diagnosis as a comparison group. They excluded those with unspecified death causes.

Researchers standardized continuous data with z-score normalization, distinguishing training and testing, and converted categorical variables into binary features using one-hot encoding. They created a new category for patients with missing diagnosis information and excluded 75 patients lacking data in two key fields: cancer stage and the gap between initial appointment and diagnosis.

The study tested six different machine learning algorithms: CatBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM, gradient boosting, random forest, and logistic regression, using various Python packages and Scikit-learn. Hyperparameter selection was performed with 10-fold cross-validation, employing Hyperopt and random search optimization strategies. The Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) and Boruta variable selection method were used to address class imbalance and feature choice, respectively.

Model performance was measured by metrics like area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC) and precision-recall curve (AUC-PR). The top 20% at-risk patients were analyzed separately, and models were assessed on multiple metrics including precision and recall. SHAP values helped understand variable impact on predictions. These approaches adhered to TRIPOD guidelines for transparency in reporting multivariable prediction models.

All models displayed strong predictive ability, with AUC-ROC scores of at least 0.871, and a general model including all types of cancer had superior performance. The study highlighted the potential of using routinely collected data to forecast cancer mortality without the need for more complex data such as genomics or imaging, which is of particular benefit for resource-limited settings.

In summary, the research produced nine models with high predictive accuracy for cancer mortality. The models serve as valuable tools to aid in treatment prioritization and resource allocation in the healthcare setting, offering significant support in areas with financial constraints. Future research should extend the methodology to diverse data and settings for broader analysis.
