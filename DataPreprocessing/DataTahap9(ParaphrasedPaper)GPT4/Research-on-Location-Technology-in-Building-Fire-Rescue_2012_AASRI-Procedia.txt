The study presents a system for accurately locating firefighters during rescue operations in buildings. This system incorporates a wireless data gateway that gathers unprocessed data from support terminals aimed at positioning, analyzes this information, calculates the location of mobile positioning devices, and relays these results to a data center. The data processing employs Different Time of Arrival (DTOA) measurements and trilateration. For precise location determination, the gateway needs to receive signals from at least four support terminals, each with simultaneous timestamps from the mobile device.

The data center, connected via wired cable, stores the location information and supports various databases, such as Oracle, SQL Server, and DB2. It also provides web service interfaces tailored to different monitoring terminals, utilizing a standard three-tier architecture for development.

Monitoring terminals present building layouts and track firefighters' positions in real time. These terminals facilitate the planning of rescue operations by exploiting location technologies, graphical technologies, database systems, and software applications. They offer functions like real-time localization, emergency alarms, and history moving trace services.

In emergencies, firefighters can send SOS signals from their mobile positioning devices, which are picked up by the data gateway and escalated to the data center. Upon receiving an alarm, the center promptly notifies all connected monitoring terminals, allowing the fire command center or headquarters to respond swiftly. The system also triggers alarms if a mobile device remains stationary for too long.

This location system, which can quickly and effectively assist in the rescue of firefighters in danger, is a reliable scenario for building fire rescue. It comprises five principal components: the mobile positioning device, the positioning-assistant terminal, the wireless data gateway, the data center, and the monitoring terminal. Together, these parts create a wireless network using short waveforms, conforming to the IEEE standard for data transmission, while the data center and monitoring terminal can function on the same computer server.
