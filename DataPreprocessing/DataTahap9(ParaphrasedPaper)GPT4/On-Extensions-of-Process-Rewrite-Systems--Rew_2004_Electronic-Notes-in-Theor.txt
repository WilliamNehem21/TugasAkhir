The academic paper provides a structured exploration of priority rewrite systems (PRS) and related systems. Here's a paraphrased summary of the mentioned sections:

In sections 2 and 3, the paper reviews fundamental concepts and characteristics of PRS and FCPRS (a variant of PRS), respectively. Section 4 introduces the concept of Priority Rewrite Systems with Weak Unit (WPRS) and also discusses State-Extended PRS, which is an extension to the standard PRS. Section 5 examines the connections between these newly introduced classes and those already existing. Additionally, it presents a hierarchy that includes both PRS and the pertinent categories of extended PRS.

The proof section provided argues that applying a pad rewrite rule affects only a single ready parallel component. Consequently, it is impossible to create a deadlock in more than one active ready parallel component with just one application of a pad rewrite rule.
