A hereditarily finite set, s, can be uniquely represented by a finite directed graph, g, where each node corresponds to an element within the transitive closure of {s}, and the graph's edges reflect the element membership relationship. Bisimulation, a concept applicable to graphs, ensures that there are no two distinct but bisimilar nodes within this canonical representation. Graphs without cycles represent well-founded sets, whereas those with cycles denote non-well-founded sets.

Addressing a broader question, can well-founded and non-well-founded hereditarily finite sets represented as graphs be handled inductively? Specifically, is it possible to construct or deconstruct such graphs in a stepwise manner? Previous work has formalized this query, wondering whether, given a set's canonical graph, one could always remove a node to yield another set's canonical graph without inducing a bisimulation collapse. While that work did not conclusively answer the question, our current paper delves deeper, demonstrating that node removal can lead to collapses. However, we present encouraging findings that it's always possible to remove an edge safely. We introduce a concept known as the n-well-founded part of a non-well-founded graph and employ Ackermann's coding method on it to support our results.

We provide proofs for two claims: first, if node v cannot be discarded without consequence, then there is a weakly connected component of the graph with v removed, which is not hyper-extensional, and a bisimulation exists that is not merely the identity bisimulation. Second, a graph under our hypothesis must have a single root, since if it had more, it would be cyclic, contradicting the assumption of acyclicity.

The paper outlines a method for computing the n-well-founded portion of a given graph, starting from a node v, considering non-well-founded nodes reachable from v, and appending well-founded trees to the ends. If there's at least one well-founded element in a set h, then it forms the root of the graph, and it becomes straightforward to identify a removable edge. In scenarios where all elements of h are non-well-founded, the situation is more complex.

Our work utilized an implementation called Sage to show that node-only removal from a set does not necessarily preserve the unique graph representation when looking to prevent bisimulation collapse. However, removing an edge is possible under certain conditions, typically when comparing nodes within the same connected component.

The research relies on a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm designed originally for establishing acyclic digraphs. This algorithm relies on essentials properties like irreducibility, aperiodicity, and symmetry for demonstrating that it converges to a uniform distribution. The study aimed to prove that elementary graph operations could transform any graph into another within the same family, aspiring to extend these results to non-well-founded sets and achieve a random generator for such sets.
