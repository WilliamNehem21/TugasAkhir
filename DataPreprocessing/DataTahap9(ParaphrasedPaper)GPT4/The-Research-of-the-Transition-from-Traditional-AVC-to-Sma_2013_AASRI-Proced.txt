The paper discusses the rising global focus on intelligent grids, identifying them as a key component of national energy strategies in Europe, the United States, and China. China's State Grid Corporation has introduced the concept of a "strong intelligent grid," with a strategic plan to have it fully implemented by 2020. Intelligent grids represent a new paradigm for energy transmission and distribution.

The current automated voltage control (AVC) and energy management systems (EMS) utilize a plug-AVC model that requires frequent interfaces between the two, leading to increased workload and inefficiency as maintenance staff must manage both systems. Traditional methods of embedding AVC within EMS have two major disadvantages: reliance on EMS manufacturer APIs for data access, and the potential security risks associated with high-level database permissions.

The paper outlines the objective function of voltage offsetâ€”to minimize the deviation of node voltages from an ideal range, with the aim of improving load node voltage levels.

It also notes the importance of the inference engine in expert systems, where it applies knowledge and reasoning methods to derive outcomes based on expert input and logical reasoning processes.

Finally, the paper anticipates future improvements in intelligent AVC system embedding and functionality, critiquing traditional AVC's shortcomings. It proposes a new approach using standard Common Information Model (CIM) for embedding intelligent AVC. This new approach brings novel features to AVC and provides fresh perspectives on how smart AVC could be developed and refined going forward.
