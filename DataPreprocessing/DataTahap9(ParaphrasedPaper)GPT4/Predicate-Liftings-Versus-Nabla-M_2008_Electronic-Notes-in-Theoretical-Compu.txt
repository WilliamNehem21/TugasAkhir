The paper discusses inductive presentations for products and coproducts, noting the importance of singleton liftings in generating predicate liftings, as demonstrated in subsequent results.

It highlights that logical translators are versatile tools that can be used to construct translators for more complex functors. These translators are shown to be extendable through products, coproducts, and composition with the covariant power set functor, a summary supported by the stated results.

The paper then refers to examples within the text to prove theorems related to coproducts, products, and the power set functor.

An induction-based proof demonstrates that for singleton liftings of base cases such as the identity and constant functors, corresponding logical translators exist. These translators can be inductively extended to any singleton lifting for a specified kpf t, thus completing the proof.

Finally, the paper presents a novel technique for comparing coalgebraic modal languages using logical translators as a means of defining translations. The critical feature of logical translators—their status as natural transformations—was crucial in proving several key theorems.
