The robust industrial development over the past century has led to significant environmental degradation, including water pollution. Effluents from various industries such as textile, paper, plastic, leather, food production, and dye manufacturing have introduced contaminants into natural water bodies, substantially deteriorating water quality. Among these pollutants, heavy metals, particularly lead (Pb) and zinc (Zn), pose severe environmental and health risks due to their toxicity and non-biodegradability. These metals are common in industrial processes like metallurgy, tannery, paper and pulp production, batteries, and paints, and they can accumulate in human tissues, leading to serious health issues such as anemia, nervous system disorders, decreased fertility, and kidney failure.

To tackle this problem, this study explores the development of an affordable manganese oxide-coated sand adsorbent to effectively remove Pb(II) and Zn(II) ions from water. Previous research in this area featured limitations such as high treatment times, excessive material doses, low adsorption capacities, and ineffectiveness under natural water conditions, often without a detailed removal mechanism. 

The study conducted batch experiments, using duplicate tests in Erlenmeyer flasks to measure average removal efficacy. Variables like metal concentration, adsorbent amount, temperature, duration of contact, and pH level were individually altered to determine their impact on adsorption. The manganese oxide-coated sand was characterized and compared with standard sand, confirming the presence of quartz alongside impurities. Adsorption was found to increase with higher amounts of the adsorbent due to more available binding sites and was also influenced by the size and electronegativity differences between Pb(II) and Zn(II) ions.

The optimal pH to avoid metal hydroxide precipitation and solely assess adsorption efficiency was identified as 6.0 for both metal ions. Adsorption capacities, better described by both Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms, indicated that the adsorbent was suitable for both Pb(II) and Zn(II) removal in varying temperatures. Kinetic studies, considering pseudo-first order, pseudo-second order, and Elovich models, suggested that film diffusion might be the rate-limiting step in the metal ion adsorption process.

In conclusion, manganese oxide-coated sand (MOCS) proved effective for removing hazardous Pb(II) and Zn(II) from industrial wastewater. It exhibited high adsorption potential under different conditions and could be regenerated with sodium hydroxide, positioning it as a cost-effective and recyclable option for mitigating water pollution caused by heavy metals.
