The paper discusses a method of representing single procedures and their applications within a restricted form called Administrative Normal Form (ANF), where function calls are exclusively tail calls. The sets of constants (including 'true' and 'false') and variables used are separate and distinct.

Recent literature has introduced type-based frameworks for register allocation rooted in ANF-like languages. The current study narrows its scope to first-order languages employing tail recursion. There is an acknowledgment that extending this to higher-order functions would be beneficial, and previous work by other researchers has included effect systems to manage the implications of function calls on register use.

Agat's model introduces a type system for low-level languages annotated with explicit register information suitable for architectures having finite registers and theoretically infinite stacks. The model uses two operational semantics: one with functional interpretation ignoring register annotations, and another with imperative semantics on register files. Unlike our representation, variables in this model do not correspond directly to registers, and additional instructions are needed for moving values between locations. The soundness of Agat's type system—ensuring functional and imperative semantics align for well-typed programs—is established with a third operational semantics. The type system incorporates effect annotations to guarantee proper register usage and avoid overlap with live locations.

Our type system functions similarly as a method for designating register allocations, dictating where and how variables are stored. However, the paper doesn't delve into the inferencing of these type judgments necessary to create the allocations. While the current representation uses a non-specific set of registers, it has the potential to be tailored to various kinds of registers (like double precision) or memory spaces by integrating a kinding system, which would help differentiate the behaviors of distinct storage areas through specialized typing or transformation rules. This framework could replicate effects such as memory spilling, though determining the optimal spilling strategy remains a matter for type inference to resolve.
