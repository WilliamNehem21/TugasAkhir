The paper discusses the CODA (Complex Organic Distributed Architecture) framework, which is inspired by cybernetic principles from the Viable System Model (VSM). VSM suggests that living systems are comprised of autonomous sub-systems that self-organize and self-regulate, allowing them to adapt to environmental changes and manage relevant complexities.

CODA involves components and connectors that must register with local management components on their host machines, empowering these local managers to supervise and control the execution life cycle of said components/connectors. Monitoring of non-functional requirements (NFRs) for components is achieved through an event-handling system within the runtime management framework's general-purpose layer. A global repository, named the GlobalManager, centralizes information about these components and connectors, aiding in component location within the system and supporting traceability.

Roles within CODA are designed to be autonomous and rely on critical success factors (CSFs) for proper operation. If a role encounters a CSF failure, it seeks assistance from higher-level roles, which can adjust operational parameters to cope with the cause of the failure. This hierarchical intervention continues up the system layers as needed.

CODA applies an advanced feedback loop concept that incorporates systemic learning â€” beyond simply adjusting parameters in response to environmental changes, CODA uses historical data to identify successful operational parameters, facilitating intelligent adaptation not common in traditional control systems.

Predictive techniques from business intelligence are essential in CODA for predicting resource usage and service success, enabling proactive adjustments to CSFs and operational parameters. The framework can even model emergent behaviors, such as new user patterns or service usages not previously known.

A monitoring layer within CODA analyzes multidimensional data to observe business operation trends in relation to external factors. By looking at historical data at different levels of aggregation, the system can react more effectively to trends.

The concept of "Survival CSFs" defines the system's capacity thresholds, based on resource limits correlated to the number of running services. Adjustments to these assumptions are made as ongoing research introduces new findings.
