The paper discusses the environmental concern that increased industrial activities have led to higher discharges of industrial effluents, which are often contaminated with heavy metals such as copper(II) and zinc(II). These metals are toxic to human health even at low concentrations; copper(II) can cause illnesses like liver damage and Wilson's disease if levels exceed 0.25 mg/L, and zinc(II) can lead to neurological issues and lethargy when concentrations surpass the 0.80 mg/L limit. Therefore, itâ€™s critical to treat wastewater containing these metals before it enters water bodies.

Recently, biochar, created from agricultural waste, has been recognized as an effective, efficient, and cost-friendly solution for eliminating heavy metals and organic pollutants from water and soil, due to its porous structure, large surface area, and abundance of functional groups and mineral content. Biochar is not only useful for water treatment but also for soil fertility, crop productivity, greenhouse gas emission reduction, waste management, and energy production. Biochars are generally produced by pyrolyzing carbon-rich agricultural waste, examples of which include corn straw, rice straw, peanut, soybean and canola straws, sugar beet tailing, oak wood, oak bark, rice husks, olive pomace, orange waste, and compost.

The study evaluates the potential of biochar made from muskmelon (Cucumis melo L.) peel to remove copper and zinc from water. By analyzing experimental data, the paper examines the sorption capacity, the rate of adsorption, and the energetics and spontaneity of the removal process. Furthermore, the surface properties of the biochar are characterized using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) to determine the functional groups present and the morphology of the biochar, which play a role in its ability to adsorb pollutants.
