This study utilized Wistar rats to mimic Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) by feeding them a high-fat diet followed by a low dose of streptozotocin (STZ). The primary focus was to investigate the effect of the compound 2-hydroxychalcone, a type of flavonoid, when administered orally. The researchers measured levels of PPAR-γ in sub-abdominal adipose tissue, as well as serum levels of adiponectin, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and insulin to assess the compound's impact on these metabolic parameters.

The research highlights the need for novel T2DM treatments due to side effects such as obesity and hypoglycemia associated with existing antidiabetic drugs. The study points out adiponectin as a key hormone produced by fat cells that has an inverse relationship with the risk of developing insulin resistance and T2DM. Chalcones, which are naturally found in plants and can be synthesized in the lab, have potential biological benefits, including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Specifically, 2-hydroxychalcone has been noted for its ability to enhance glucose uptake and simulate insulin effects.

The study methodology involved inducing T2DM in rats using a high-fat diet and then treating them with 2-hydroxychalcone. The effects of the treatment were measured by examining body weight changes, which were improved after treatment, and lipid profiles, which showed amelioration in treated rats compared to untreated diabetic controls. The compound also significantly decreased levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), a marker of oxidative stress associated with diabetes-related cell damage. Additionally, the treatment increased levels of glutathione (GSH), a key antioxidant whose depletion is notable in diabetic conditions.

In summary, the findings indicate that 2-hydroxychalcone has a beneficial effect on various metabolic disturbances associated with T2DM, such as dyslipidemia, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Correlations between adiponectin levels, antioxidant markers, and MDA were observed, corroborating the compound's potential as a therapeutic agent for managing T2DM.
