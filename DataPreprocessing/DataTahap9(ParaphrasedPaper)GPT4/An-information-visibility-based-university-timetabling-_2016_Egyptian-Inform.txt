The paper discusses the prevalent inefficiencies in the use of teaching spaces within academic institutions, noting that rooms are often either underutilized or only partially filled. This is not necessarily due to a lack of resources, but rather a lack of information regarding the usage of these spaces caused by a deficit in effective management systems.

The study highlights the challenges encountered by Egyptian public universities that are exacerbated by increasing student numbers and fluctuating attendance patterns. These dynamics result in both underuse and crowding of spaces due to irregular attendance and cross-faculty course attendance, as well as transfers between departments.

To address this issue, the authors propose a solution combining genetic algorithms and Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) technology to optimize space management. The paper is structured to first review existing literature, then outline the proposed solution, followed by a testing and results section, and concluding with the main findings and suggestions for future research.

The paper also refers to a case study at the University of North Carolina, where effective space utilization was found to be crucial for cost savings and informed future space acquisitions. However, the study lacked technological support for monitoring and was not connected with timetabling.

Moreover, the research examines how RFID technology, previously used successfully in manufacturing for job-shop scheduling, can be applied to manage resources in academic settings. RFID provides enhanced information visibility, which can help mitigate resource wastage and improve operations during unexpected disruptions.

Additionally, the paper mentions the importance of better problem-solving algorithms in timetabling, as noted during the first international conference on the practice and theory of automated timetabling (PATAT). The subsequent international timetabling competitions (ITC) foster the development and application of such algorithms.

The authors report on the success of their suggested approach, using a genetic algorithm (UGA), which achieved significantly improved room usage and time savings compared to traditional manual scheduling.

When residual issues of underutilization or overutilization persisted, the paper suggests merging underused events sharing common elements or splitting overcrowded ones into subgroups wherever feasible, to better manage space and resources.

Finally, the paper cites a specific study on the teaching space allocation problem with splitting, illustrating the complexity of the issue and the need for innovative solutions.
