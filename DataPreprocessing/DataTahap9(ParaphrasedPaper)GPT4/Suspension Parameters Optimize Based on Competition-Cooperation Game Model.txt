While multi-objective optimization has been a long-standing area of interest, its relevance in solving engineering challenges remains undiminished. The key goal in addressing these multi-objective engineering optimization tasks is to identify Pareto-optimal solutions. However, there are occasions where Pareto-optimal solutions might not exist. Thus, finding effective methods to tackle multi-objective optimization issues is of great importance. Over the past years, various algorithms have been developed to address these problems, including ant colony optimization, genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization, artificial fish swarm optimization, and their enhanced variants.

Multi-objective optimization aims to discover the optimal values considering multiple goals simultaneously. This objective shares common ground with game theory, which seeks to maximize the individual gains of each participant within a game. The commonality between the two lies in the pursuit of Pareto solutions. Game theory, with its strategies based on the behavior of agents categorized as cooperative, selfish, or non-cooperative, has proven useful in resolving multi-objective optimization problems, particularly within engineering contexts.
