Augmented reality (AR) in education is particularly effective for teaching abstract and intangible concepts by enabling students to see and interact with learning materials in a way that enhances understanding. Research indicates that AR can be more successful than traditional print or desktop-based learning tools for such subjects (Chen et al., 2011; Chiu et al., 2015; Radu, 2014).

Students often struggle to grasp abstract concepts in subjects like chemistry, which can be attributed to the limited ability of 2D instructional materials to represent three-dimensional molecular structures. AR technology can enhance the comprehension of molecule spatial configurations by presenting them in 3D (Maier & Klinker, 2013).

Fixed AR technology displayed on computer screens, despite lacking portability, offers a cost-effective and accessible way to introduce AR learning tools into classrooms with existing computer hardware.

Xiao et al. (2016) developed a mobile AR app to aid primary school students in learning about astronomy, which showed promising increases in student engagement and satisfaction. Singhal et al. (2012) created an AR system to help students understand 3D chemical models, which was enjoyable and educational according to exhibition observations. Cai, Wang, and Chiang (2014) also demonstrated the effectiveness of an AR learning tool in chemistry education through improved test scores and positive student attitudes.

AR applications have also been used to help university students master biochemistry concepts, leading to high success rates on assessment tests.

Wojciechowski and Cellary (2013) found that both perceived usefulness and enjoyment of an AR system influenced student attitudes toward the technology, with enjoyment being a more significant factor for intention to use. Similar results were observed in senior-level chemistry courses (Crandall et al., 2015).

Adoption of AR technology can be affected by educators' and students' willingness to embrace it, with resistance to change posing a potential challenge (Kerawalla et al., 2006).

The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), created by Davis (1989), is often used to evaluate a technological system's perceived usefulness and ease of use, which can predict user intention to adopt the technology (Marangunic & Granic, 2015; Sun & Cheng, 2009; Teo, 2009). Higher TAM scores suggest greater perceived usefulness and ease of use.

Using the Blender software, chemical bond models were designed and integrated into an AR scenario with QR codes, which let students interact with the 3D models on their smartphones via an Android-compatible APK file exported from Unity.

A quasi-experimental study involving control and experimental groups of high school students examined the efficacy of an AR app in teaching chemistry. The study followed rigorous procedures for testing and class instruction and found that acceptance of the AR app among university students was above average according to TAM questionnaire scores.

Research highlights that technology adoption by educators poses challenges, with perceived usefulness profoundly affecting usage (Fraillon et al., 2014; Straub, 2009; Davis, 1993). Providing necessary training and resources can improve technology's perceived usefulness and encourage its use.

The pedagogical implications of using AR in education include enhancing learning through physical manipulation of objects, facilitating abstract learning through the contextual presentation of information, and improving collaborative and relevant learning experiences.

Limitations of the study included the inability to randomly assign participants to groups, the novelty effect of AR technology possibly influencing student motivation, and the short duration of the intervention.
