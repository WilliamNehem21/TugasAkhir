This academic paper explores the analytical modeling of global software development teams, focusing on the structure and interactions between the central team and other team members. Section 3 of the paper outlines a practical case study to showcase the problem and presents an analytical model designed to understand it better. Section 4 compares the model's numerical analysis with actual project data. Specifically, section 4.3 investigates how variations in the central entity's availability and support level affect total project completion time. The paper concludes with a summary of future research directions and the study's significant findings.

Analytical modeling, often using state-based Markov chains and related formalisms, is leveraged across various fields, including economics, physics, engineering, and bioinformatics. Stochastic Automata Networks (SAN) are a modular and efficient Markovian formalism utilized to model complex systems as smaller, interacting components. SAN's are particularly suitable for modeling distributed software development, where each entity is modeled individually with selective synchronization events.

The paper discusses a project, referred to as "Project Alpha," which encountered various challenges due to geographical dispersion and the allocation of the central team, impacting support quality and necessitating adjustments for time-zone differences. Data for the quantitative analysis was gathered from project logs, manager interviews, and participant surveys.

An interesting finding from the paper is the difference in work patterns between senior and junior team members. While senior members worked close to a standard workday, junior members were only working effectively for a little over an hour within an eight-hour period, spending a significant portion of their time seeking solutions. The minimal interaction between juniors and the central team suggests that the limited support and availability from the central team could be a contributing factor.
