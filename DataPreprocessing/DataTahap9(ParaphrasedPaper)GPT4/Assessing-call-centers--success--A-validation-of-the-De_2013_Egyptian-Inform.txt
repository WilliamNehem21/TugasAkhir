The Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) industry is an increasingly vital sector in the 21st-century global economy, bolstered by advances in telecommunications, international trade agreements, and evolving cultural norms in developing nations. This sector encompasses technology-driven services offered by call centers, which range from handling simple phone calls to executing sales campaigns and providing advanced remote troubleshooting and technical assistance.

Research into BPO effectiveness can be approached by studying two primary outcomes: user satisfaction and the net benefits derived from call center operations. These outcomes are analyzed based on various input factors including system quality, information quality, service quality, and usage. Multiple regression analysis is utilized as a statistical method to model user satisfaction as a function of these input factors, while net benefits are also modeled taking into account the inputs and user satisfaction.

Within this model, a greater emphasis is placed on the system and service quality dimensions. Call center managers can leverage this modeling approach to adjust weightings within these dimensions to achieve the organization's strategic goals. By employing multiple linear regression analysis, a predictive formula is constructed for both user satisfaction and net benefits, allowing for future projections of these dimensions based on the performance of the other variables.
