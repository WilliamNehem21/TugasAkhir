Our primary contribution, presented in Section 3, is to provide a comprehensive and simplified axiomatic description of steady-state behavior and the process of reaching it, which broadens the traditional concept. Our generalized approach to convergence is relevant to all Markov processes, not just specific instances, and it also connects stationary behavior to the average behavior over extended periods. Section 5 contains the full explanation of these concepts.
