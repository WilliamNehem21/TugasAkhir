A reasoned approach for tracking ground targets in formation is set out, encompassing the steps of initiating, separating, merging, and updating formations, built upon the dynamics of formation movement. To efficiently update and manage multi-target tracking, the method utilizes a central tracking strategy, which optimizes the computational load and conserves system resources.

This method utilizes a Filtered-IMM using Particle Filters (FCIMM-UPF) algorithm to proficiently track targets within a formation, which has been reference in previous works (Bilik I and Tabrikian J, 2010; Ronghua G, et al., 2007).

To maintain tracking of formation targets, one could use the geometric center of the minimum bounding rectangle or circle that encompasses the formation. By adjusting the geometric center when new targets join, the method stays accurate by adapting to alterations in the formation's area. Using the minimum bounding rectangle as an example, the paper details identification and the evolutionary relationship of the spatial structure within the formation, maintaining orientation parallel to the coordinate axes.

The proposed method addresses target measurements by first determining the center of the minimum enclosing rectangle, followed by establishing a relationship between the center and all measurements within the formation.

The discovery of a new target necessitates calculating the shortest distance to the center of any current formations. Should the distance meet a predefined criterion, the target is integrated into the nearest formation; if not, it's treated as the onset of a new formation, either by expanding the current formation window or by separating the formation.

The algorithm processes the maintenance of formation states, the integration of new targets into formations, and the handling of target losses, which equates to the formations' separation. Separate methodologies are applied to a specific tracking example to understand the influence the number of targets might have on these two distinct tracking strategies. For modeling target motion, constant velocity (CV) and constant turn (CT) models are adopted (Ronghua G, et al., 2007).
