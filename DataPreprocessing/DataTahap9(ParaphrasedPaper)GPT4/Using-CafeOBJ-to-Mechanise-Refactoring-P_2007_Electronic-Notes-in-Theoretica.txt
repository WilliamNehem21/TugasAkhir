This paper illustrates how to use the rewriting system CafeOBJ to validate refactoring rules for software development, and it presents a practical case study demonstrating these refactorings. The paper enhances the formal integrity of the refactoring process, as relying on manual proofing can lead to errors. The findings suggest that rewriting systems may be employed as tools to help build refactoring tools.

The structure of the paper is as follows:

1. Introduction to ROOL, the language for formalizing refactorings.
2. Presentation of three exemplary refactoring rules.
3. Brief overview of the rewriting system CafeOBJ.
4. Mechanization of proof for the refactoring rules and implementation of two refactorings in CafeOBJ.
5. Description of a case study to validate the approach.
6. Conclusions and future work directions.

In detail, the paper:

- Provides only a selection of command and class laws essential for understanding proof mechanization.
- Describes a comprehensive set of refactoring rules through a pair of boxes indicating the transformation and conditions for their application.
- Discusses three refactoring rules: method extraction and inlining, the introduction of getter and setter methods, and moving a method between classes.
- Details CafeOBJâ€™s features and historical lineage within the OBJ family of languages and its uses in various domains.

The proof mechanization comes in two parts:

- Implementing the ROOL grammar and laws.
- Automatically deriving the rules from the implemented laws.

Additionally, the authors explain several technical operators used within refactorings and express the necessity of building efficient ways to check side conditions of refactoring rules within the CafeOBJ environment, based on ROOL's type system.

The paper advocates for rewriting systems as support for generating refactoring environments, citing the need for future work to enhance the checking of side conditions and integrating type information from programs.
