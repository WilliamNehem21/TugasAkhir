In this paper, we examine a novel category of mobile membrane systems known as enhanced mobile membranes. These systems integrate additional rules beyond traditional mobile membranes, notably contextual evolution rules that dictate the conditions under which an object within a membrane can evolve, as well as rules governing the processes of endocytosis and exocytosis. We apply enhanced mobile membrane models to simulate various processes within the immune system. 

The immune system, a frequently updated topic in immunology literature, comprises cells that collaborate with proteins to neutralize and eliminate foreign elements in the body. Activation of immune cells may take some time, but once active, they are highly effective in combatting pathogens. White blood cells, or immune cells, produced in large numbers in the bone marrow come in different types with specialized functions, including direct attack on invaders, destruction of compromised body cells, and production of antibodies by B cells to mark pathogens for elimination. Memory cells within the immune system are capable of recalling previous pathogens, allowing for faster and stronger responses upon reencounter.

The structure of the study is outlined as follows: Section 2 provides an introduction to the immune system. Section 3 describes the enhanced mobile membranes with the additional rules. Section 4 offers examples of how these membrane systems can represent immune system mechanisms, while Section 5 examines the structural properties of mobile membranes. The paper concludes with a summary and references.

Lymphocytes, a category of white blood cells, are produced in the bone marrow but migrate to components of the lymphatic system such as lymph nodes, spleen, and thymus. There are primarily two types of lymphocytes: T cells and B cells. The lymphatic system incorporates a network of vessels to transport and store lymphocytes and helps filter out dead cells and pathogens, utilizing receptors on lymphatic cells to identify foreign antigens.

A macrophage engulfs a pathogen and displays parts of its proteins, as epitopes, to alert other immune cells of the invader. Dendritic cells specialize in presenting antigens to T cells, especially potent in activating naive T cells. Mature dendritic cells in lymphoid tissues demonstrate high levels of MHC molecules that enable stable antigen presentation, leading to immune responses or tolerance induction based on different cell statuses and costimulatory signals.

T cells undergo selection to ensure they interact effectively with self peptides presented by MHC but do not react strongly enough to harm the body. Cytotoxic T cells destroy infected cells through release of lymphotoxins, while helper T cells assist other immune elements. B cells, upon encountering antigens, require signals from helper T cells to become fully operational, leading to the creation of plasma cells and memory B cells which are crucial for immune response and long-term immunity.

Regarding membrane operations, the paper discusses various rules. One such rule is that the membrane's state is unchanged while a multiset of objects can transform during an operation, controlled not by an object within but by a set of objects in an engulfing membrane. Actions follow a maximum set of rules for evolution steps.

In summary, this paper delves into the correlation between advanced mobile membrane systems and the simulation of immune system functions, highlighting the intricate processes of immune cell activation, antigen presentation, and the selective maturation of T cells, all aimed at orchestrating a protective response against pathogens.
