This academic paper discusses "HUGO," a tool that not only supports model checking but also allows for animating and generating Java code from UML state machine models. The goal is to guarantee that the Java code generated is consistent with the properties verified by the Promela model. However, the current version has limitations due to the requirement that guards and statements must be expressed in either Promela or Java, and some constructs supported by code generation are not available in the model checker.

The structure of the paper includes an introduction to the relevant UML notations in Section 2, a discussion of the translation of state machines to Promela in Section 3, and a description of the verification of collaborations in Section 4. Section 5 is not fully described in the provided text.

The paper clarifies how state machines are modeled in Promela to handle concurrency and events. Each state is represented by an individual Promela process. Two additional processes manage event dispatching and transition handling. Communication inside a state machine is done through unbuffered channels, while events are stored in a buffered channel.

State machines have an array representing their states and manage queues of ordinary and completion events. A global semaphore ensures that internal state machine operations cannot interfere with each other, which helps reduce the state space for the model checker to explore.

The concept of completion events is explained, which are triggered after a state or a state machine completes its assigned activities.

The translation structure aims to be easy to inspect for correctness and adaptable to future changes in UML semantics, also anticipating UML version 2.0 changes. The programming approach should support the full suite of UML constructs. The paper acknowledges that the HUGO tool currently does not support choice states, unlike some methods based on static pre-computation.

The paper also mentions related work by Latella, Majzik, and Massink, who provided semantics for a behavioral subset of UML state machines in Promela. However, their work omitted several features such as activities, actions, completion events, and transitions, history states, and context. Additionally, their approach was limited to single state machines and did not support collaboration verification. A comparison with their work is not possible as their model checker is no longer available.
