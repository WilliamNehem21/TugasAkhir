The paper discusses the expansion of the rewriting calculus, a computational framework for specifying term rewriting strategies. It proposes a higher-order language where rules themselves are represented as terms that can explicitly transform other terms through application. The calculus permits non-deterministic application of rules to terms, producing multiple results.

Strategies in this calculus are formulated as rules capable of manipulating other rules, resulting in a flexible system where rules serve as both first-class objects and higher-order functions. The novelty of the paper lies in its introduction of a logical foundation for the rewriting calculus, specifically through the lens of ordered linear logic. This logical framework aims to enhance the calculus by providing a basis for its analysis and by adding capabilities, such as 'higher-form rewriting', where rules can be applied to other rules in a recursive fashion.

The logical semantics proposed by the paper promises to enrich the expressiveness of the calculus, enabling complex meta-program operations like completion or termination analysis to be encoded natively within the system. This represents an advancement from traditional first-order rewriting systems.

Through the use of ordered linear logic extended with higher-order features, terms are interpreted as logical formulas, and rule applications are seen as entailment within this logic. The authors emphasize that most operational rules of the rewriting calculus are sound with respect to the new semantics, indicating compatibility between the computational model and the logical system. The paper suggests that this logical underpinning can guide further development and formal analysis of the rewriting calculus system.

The work is a collaboration among Hélène Cirstea, Claude Kirchner, Luigi Liquori, and Benjamin Wack, with their findings presented at an international workshop on strategies in rewriting and programming.
