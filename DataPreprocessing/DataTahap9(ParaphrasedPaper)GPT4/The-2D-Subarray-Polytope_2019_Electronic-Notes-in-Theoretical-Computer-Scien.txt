A broader version of the study has been explored from a polyhedral viewpoint in previous research. One study presented new lower bound estimations for the smallest possible covering by examining the fractional solutions from a linear program's relaxed version. Another work discussed two different integer programming models aimed at covering a convex polygon with rectangles.

While the algorithms provided are faster than cubic time, they may not be practical for dealing with matrices that are nearly the size of real images. In situations where column generation is employed, it's not necessary to solve the problem to perfection. A single column that can reduce costs is enough to proceed. This fact suggests that quicker heuristic methods may be beneficial, particularly those based on linear programming, such as rounding heuristics. For this reason, the paper is interested in using an integer-programming based method for the maximum subarray problem when d equals 2.

The relevant polytope can be viewed as a 2D counterpart of the polytope formed by the convex hull of binary vectors having consecutive ones, known as the full interval vectors polytope. Studies on this corresponding polytope have influenced some of the findings in the present research.
