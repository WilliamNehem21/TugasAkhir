The paper discusses how agents operate with an imperfect grasp of their surroundings and limited interaction abilities. An agent's understanding of the external environment is based on what it can sense, which varies depending on its sensing tools. The study emphasizes the agent's behavior in response to environmental perceptions, not how it acquires those perceptions. This could be through messages, downloads, or physical sensors.

For example, a robot adapts its speed based on its weather perception: moving slowly in rain, quickly in sunshine, and stopping in snow. The paper also describes how to handle uncertain environment representations by assigning probability to different perceptions. This approach allows examination of the agent's responses, assuming, for example, that snow is rare, while sun and rain are more common with specified probabilities.

The concept of "possible beliefs" determines what an agent might conclude from its perceptions when the environment's changes are unpredictable. Furthermore, an effective way to characterize these beliefs is presented, which can help engineers design agent behaviors based on probabilistic outcomes.

As for the study of multi-agent systems using computational logic, the IMPACT system is a noted example. It uses logic programming for agent beliefs and defines actions through constraints and bases. Various works have tackled representing incomplete information in multi-agent systems via abduction and dynamic knowledge updates.

The paper also contrasts its approach with other research in logic programming that focuses on static program composition, while this study concentrates on interactive programs with dynamic environments.

Abductive logic programming is another technique for handling incomplete knowledge, where agents can formulate hypotheses as long as they align with existing rules. However, this paper focuses on a bottom-up approach rather than abductive logic programmingâ€™s backward reasoning.

Lastly, the document mentions research in concurrency, which often abstracts away from computation details to focus on process interactions. In contrast, this paper looks at how computation and interaction are intertwined for agents.

In summary, the paper proposes a logic-based formalization for modeling agents' probabilistic behavior in response to environmental changes. It introduces the concepts of probabilistic beliefs and invariants to support quantitative analysis of reactive agent behavior, enabling effective, resource-bounded analysis of these systems.
