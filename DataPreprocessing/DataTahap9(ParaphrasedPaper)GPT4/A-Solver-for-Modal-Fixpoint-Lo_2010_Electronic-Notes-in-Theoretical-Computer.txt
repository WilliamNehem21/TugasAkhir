In this academic paper, we present a new software called MLSolver, which serves as a framework for determining the satisfiability and validity of several modal fixpoint logics. In addition to its primary functions, MLSolver can also function as a model checker for these logics. Despite its capabilities, MLSolver is not designed to rival the performance of specialized model checkers that are dedicated to logics such as CTL, LTL, and similar ones.

One of the core problems addressed in the context of logic games is the computation of outcomes in a parity game, where the goal is to identify the winning player for each node based on the strategies that guarantee victory for every play initiated from that node. It is established that this problem is clearly defined, meaning there is a definite winner for each node.

An additional challenge that isn't demonstrated by the benchmarks provided in the paper is the complexity of propositional reasoning. For example, formulas modeling binary counters can lead to the construction of parity games that increase exponentially in size when they are translated into disjunctive or conjunctive normal form, making the decision process for these formulas difficult solely due to the scale of the resulting games.
