The field of geosciences has seen widespread use of spatial prediction techniques for categorical target variables using auxiliary spatial data. This is evident in various realms such as land use, land cover, vegetation, landslides, rock, soil, and geological classifications. These predictive mappings aid in informed decision-making across environmental and risk management domains.

Indicator kriging with external drift (IKED) involves integrating auxiliary variables as linear determinants into the kriging system for predicting categorical occurrences, although estimating external drift and covariance parameters can be complex. Regression-kriging of indicators (RKI) combines logistic regression with kriging of residuals, incorporating variogram modeling to refine predictions. A variation, regression-kriging of memberships (RKFM), uses continuous membership values rather than binary indicators.

Spatial multinomial logistic mixed models offer an alternative approach leveraging spatial dependence through correlated latent variables, expressing the probability function as a logistic combination of spatial covariances. This method advances upon IKED in handling heterogeneous auxiliary information without the latter's issues, at the cost of increased computational demands.

A specific method involves utilizing Random Forest classifiers, which are trained ensemble methods employing bootstrapped datasets and subsets of predictors to reduce variance. Majoritarian voting among the decision trees determines category assignment. This approach has been tested using both simulated and real geochemical data, showing comparative performance against geostatistical methods and machine learning techniques like support vector machines, with parameter optimization through cross-validation.

Evaluation of these methods is done using metrics such as accuracy (the proportion of correct classifications) and the Rand index (which compares the predicted and true classifications by examining the assignments of all pairs of points).

The paper introduces a 'classification random forest-based method' for precise spatial prediction of categorical variables, guaranteeing that predictions at sampling points are identical to observed values, a concept familiar in geostatistics. This new method integrates classification random forest, signed distance functions, principal component analysis, and randomized quadratic programming for precise predictions and has shown efficacy on both simulated and real data. Easily implemented, it confidently handles multiple categories and offers realistic uncertainty estimates, avoiding issues like unstable prediction probabilities seen in regression-kriging of indicators. Additionally, it allows for swift updates to predictive maps with new observations requiring minimal recalculations.
