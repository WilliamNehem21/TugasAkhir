This study explores a model that extends monads, which are mathematical structures used to represent computations with side effects, by incorporating free operations through a method known as the cofree coalgebra construction. This leads to the conception of non-wellfounded trees that model side-effecting processes and are an extension of the infinite resumption monad. These extended types have been of interest recently because they have been shown to support guarded iteration, a way in which a computation can repeatedly apply an operation under certain conditions.

The paper presents a new result demonstrating that these extended monadic types can also support unguarded iteration. This means they qualify as complete Elgot monads, a type of monad that can handle iterative processes without the restrictive conditions previously thought necessary. For a monad to be an Elgot monad, the base effects it models must also permit unguarded iteration.

The text discusses the concept of guardedness, which is the idea that recursive calculations within these monads must occur only following a free operation. The paper references related work showing that guarded recursion is possible with these structures as well. The aim is to eliminate the need for these constraints when defining potentially infinite recursive processes.

The motivation behind these findings is to be able to write computation loops, such as "while" loops, without the need for guards at every iteration, as was previously required. An improvement over earlier frameworks, T_B (the extended type) being a complete Elgot monad, enables writing such loops with fewer restrictions. The paper expands on this concept in one of its sections and revisits a standard example of unguarded recursion from process algebra in another.

The research is grounded in the theoretical framework set forth by Moggi, where the notion of computation is formulated within the environment of a strong monad operating over a cartesian category. This study, however, is carried out within a distributive category to accommodate the necessary constructions. The distributive category is defined by its support for finite products and coproducts, as well as certain other conditions.

Lastly, the study briefly outlines the definition of the coinductive generalized resumption transformer, focusing on a simple version of this concept for clarity, and proves the main result that the class of complete Elgot monads is stable under the cofree coalgebra construction.
