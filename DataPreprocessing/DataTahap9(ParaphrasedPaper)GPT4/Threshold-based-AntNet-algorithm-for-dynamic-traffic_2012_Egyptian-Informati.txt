Research in ant routing algorithms has primarily been focused on optimizing paths in communication networks, but its application to dynamic road traffic routing remains comparatively sparse. Dynamic routing is critical for managing traffic flow and steering vehicles away from congestion. Several attempts to apply ant-based algorithms to road traffic have been made, including an Ant-Based Control (ABC) algorithm used for city traffic routing, an Ant-Based Routing for City-based Parking Routing System (CBPRS), and modified versions of ABC and the AntNet algorithm for routing vehicles with historical traffic data. Additionally, AntNet has been used to enhance travel times by rerouting traffic in congested road networks.

Central to the effectiveness of these algorithms is the ability to rapidly explore and adjust to changes in the road network. The paper proposes an improved algorithm that not only finds better routes more quickly but also maintains them. A special type of software agent, called "check ants," oversees the quality of these routes and discards any that degrade.

The paper's structure includes an introduction to the standard AntNet algorithm, a detailed explanation of the proposed enhanced version, a section on simulation experiments, and a conclusion. It introduces a method to establish benchmark travel times between nodes and employs a set of rules within the AntNet framework to significantly reduce computational overhead. This facilitates faster route discovery and adaptation to changes in traffic conditions.

Regarding performance, the traditional complexity for the proposed threshold algorithm in a network with 'n' nodes is theoretically worst-case O(n^2). Nevertheless, once a route is established, the processing time reduces to a constant that only depends on the number of nodes in that route, monitored by "check ants." This approach allows for swift adaptation to network changes, as more "forward ants" can quickly identify and establish viable routes for any adjustments needed in traffic flow. The paper asserts that even in a parallel processing environment, the new algorithm would outperform the standard AntNet due to its faster convergence on optimal routes and its efficient preservation of these routes.
