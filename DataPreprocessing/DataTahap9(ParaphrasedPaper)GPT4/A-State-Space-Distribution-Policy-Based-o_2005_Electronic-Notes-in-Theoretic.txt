Our goal is to enhance the efficiency of distributed model checking and state space reduction by introducing an innovative state distribution policy for workers. This policy aims to decrease the transitions between states across different workers, thereby reducing the communication costs associated with distributed algorithms.

The core concept involves using abstract interpretation to generate a compact state space approximation. We use this approximation to predict how the actual states are connected. States with expected connectivity are then distributed among the same worker. Trials indicate significant reductions in the number of transitions between different workers' states, with only a minor imbalance in the distribution of nodes per worker.

Reactive systems are represented by state spaces or labeled transition systems, with nodes denoting states and edges indicating state transitions. Enumerative model checking creates an LTS from the system's specifications, and a model checking algorithm verifies the desired properties. These algorithms often rely on reachability procedures, thus reducing communication costs means minimizing transitions between workers (cross transitions). Workers should have a balanced number of nodes to fully utilize parallelism.

We propose calculating a minimal state space approximation by abstractly interpreting the system's specification. The abstract state connectivity guides us in assigning concrete states to workers accordingly. Our implementation revealed fewer cross transitions and a reasonable distribution of nodes across workers when compared to a random distribution approach.

Good graph partitioning, an NP-hard problem, is crucial for these distributed algorithms. While existing heuristics and stochastic processes (e.g., simulated annealing, genetic algorithms) attempt near-optimal solutions, we've designed a heuristic specifically for behavior-representing graphs (LTSs). Our approach, while ensuring a low cross transition ratio, may slightly affect system balance.

Distributed tools work iteratively with computation and communication phases, with balanced workloads necessary for computation efficacy. Communication relies on the exchange of neighbor states information, thus reducing cross transitions is vital. Our abstract interpretations offer predictions on the state graph's structure to optimize cross transitions. However, the drawback might be an unbalanced system due to a lack of information on how many concrete states tie to each abstract state.

We distributed abstract states into classes to resolve this, ensuring minimal effects on system balance and cross transitions. The selection of the initial abstraction is crucial; our experiments hide most of the system but keep variables controlling the system flow visible, favoring accurate final graph representations.

The abstract distribution consistently outperforms random distribution in terms of internal transition percentages, except in one scenario possibly caused by an overly small initial abstraction. Despite this, gains in most cases are considerable.

Though random distributions maintain better balance, abstraction-guided distributions render higher discrepancies in worker loads but offer significant improvements in transition ratios. Abstraction computation is fast, without adding complexity to state space generation.

Future experiments aim to evaluate the performance speed-up of distributed model checking tools, with anticipated performance increases, particularly in algorithms where transition distribution is crucial. By integrating sophisticated algorithms and interfacing with software packages like Chaco, we can improve state and transition distributions, enhancing the scalability and performance of our method.
