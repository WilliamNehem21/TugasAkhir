In the academic paper, the author acknowledges the relevance of traditional clone theory, which deals with subclones of the clone of all non-nullary operations, in the broader context of the general theory of clones. Traditional clone theory is seen as a valuable and specific area within the overall theory, which now includes the consideration of nullary operations in clones. The author points out that there is an interest in understanding the relationship between the traditional clones (old clones) and the new, generalized clones that can include nullary operations.

The author advocates for a unified approach to the concepts of term operation, clone, abstract clone, and Lawvere theory, suggesting that clones should be able to contain nullary operations. This idea is not unique to the author, as other scholars and works also define and use clones that may include nullary operations. The author refers to recent works that extend clone theory to arbitrary categories, indicating a trend toward including nullary operations in the theory.

The paper describes plans to define four operators in subsection 3.1 that will be used to compare and contrast traditional clones with the new clones and to specifically identify the position of the new clones within the overall lattice structure of clones. These operators will facilitate understanding the role of traditional clones (those without nullary operations) within the new more generalized framework.

We learn that the exchange of knowledge about clones with and without nullary operations is something commonly accepted within the universal algebra community. However, some authors still show hesitance to fully embrace nullary operations, either out of a desire to maintain consistency with traditional clone theory or due to potential minor technical issues that may arise. The author intends to provide a reliable foundation for the main theorem about Galois theory for clones with nullary operations, to avoid the need for modifications and to foster greater adoption of clones with nullary operations among universal algebraists. The author suggests that this could lead to wider acceptance and integration of nullary operations in clone theory.
