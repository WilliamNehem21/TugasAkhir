To the best of our knowledge, recent research has proven some properties of the IEEE 802.11 standard, but the efforts have three primary shortcomings. First, while the standard was formally defined, its verification was carried out informally and without a mechanized process. Second, the standard's properties were evaluated without modeling time, thus only non-temporal safety and liveness properties were assessed, excluding those related to timely performance crucial for Quality of Service (QoS) and real-time applications. Third, to understand another limitation, it's necessary to describe the IEEE 802.11 standard's coordination functions.

IEEE 802.11 incorporates two coordination strategies: Point Coordination Function (PCF) and Distributed Coordination Function (DCF). PCF relies on an arbitrating station to coordinate access to the communication medium, thereby preventing access conflicts. DCF relies on a distributed approach, offering only best-effort message delivery. Analysis of the protocol must consider both functions due to the potential for alternating between PCF and DCF in operation, but past verification did not account for their combined impact or any resulting interference.

The IEEE 802.11 standard also has another version, IEEE 802.11e, which includes mechanisms for message prioritization. The coordination functions in this version, Hybrid Coordination Function (HCF) and Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCF), function similarly to PCF and DCF but with capabilities for handling traffic categories.

Moving forward, the paper describes the MAC layer of IEEE 802.11 and UPPAAL, a model checker for verifying timed automata. It also discusses the specification and verification processes and concludes with comments and future research directions.

The DCF and PCF are two MAC schemes in IEEE 802.11, where PCF is an arbitration-based access control system, and DCF allows stations to compete for medium access, leading to potential collisions. DCF operates using Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA); it involves checking for a clear medium and a backoff procedure when the medium is busy, iterating until an acknowledgment is received or a threshold of attempts is reached.

PCF is optional in IEEE 802.11 and alternates with DCF when in use. Under PCF, the network enters a contention-free period and communication is coordinated via polling by the point coordinator.

In UPPAAL, a timed automaton comprises states, transitions, clocks, and other variables for expressing conditions and synchronizations. The MAC sublayer was modeled with six automata, encompassing the station's behavior under DCF and PCF, the point coordinator, the carrier sense function, and the medium itself.

Verification involved testing the MAC protocol under various automata networks and scenario configurations. Despite state explosion issues with larger scenarios, results were compatible whether modes operated independently or concurrently. Properties were checked using UPPAAL, with the longest verification taking about 2 hours.

Ultimately, the research provided a formal verification and specification integrating both DCF and PCF. It also suggested that future work should consider the IEEE 802.11 standard's application in mobile systems to account for potential temporary failures due to station mobility.
