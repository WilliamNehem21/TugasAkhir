To address the challenges in remote thesis supervision, researchers have explored the use of Virtual Reality (VR) to enhance the experience in higher education settings. VR's potential role in this context has been supported by studies like Li et al. (2022) on distance learning calligraphy, Chen et al. (2021) on a VR-based remote education platform, and Ying et al. (2017) with their VR educational platform, VREX. VR provides an innovative way for teachers to convey information and interact with students. However, past research has often focused on individual learning or remote collaborative learning, overlooking the teacher-student collaborative experience during supervision. The present study seeks to fill this gap by tailoring a VR application to thesis supervision meetings and exploring how VR can support collaborative supervision.

Before COVID-19, remote supervision was mainly for international students but became widespread due to the pandemic. Researchers have examined the challenges of remote supervision, revealing the importance of both asynchronous interaction, which allows for time-delayed exchange of complex information and one-way notifications, and synchronous interaction, which facilitates real-time information exchange and social presence. However, research on synchronous collaboration in VR is limited.

In this study, a case study involving 22 rounds of supervision meetings was conducted, covering various aspects of thesis development. Two teachers provided interdisciplinary supervision to each of five students, combining domain-specific guidance and academic support to enhance learning outcomes. Fieldwork included semi-structured interviews to understand previous supervision experiences and the environment, followed by detailed interviews with participants about VR-based supervision experiences.

Thematic analysis was used to interpret the data collected through interviews, observations, and audio recordings. Four key themes emerged: translating supervision work into virtual environments, hidden interests of supervision, emotional interaction and collaboration, and emphasis on supervision efficiency. Issues such as cultural differences, the struggle to match VR with established workflows, and the need for efficient communication tools were discussed. The study underscores the importance of considering cultural, educational, and technical factors when designing VR applications for specific educational domains and highlights the need for customization to meet specific user needs.

This study suggests improvements for VR technology in supervision scenarios, emphasizing the need to develop systems that support continuous interaction, customize information architecture, and cater to various user group cultural differences. The findings aim to contribute to the design of VR applications for educational supervision and encourage the sharing of insights and design implementations for similar research interests in VR-based computer and education purposes.
