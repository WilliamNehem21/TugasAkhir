The escalating adoption of biometric technologies for various applications has sparked an interest in developing monitoring solutions to identify individuals in a setting. Among the different biometric methods like fingerprint, iris, and face recognition, face recognition stands out for autonomous systems due to its non-interactive nature. A crucial aspect of reliable face recognition is the way faces are represented, which is challenging due to the variations in faces. For instance, even a simple rotation of the face can lead to a radically different 3D matrix representation, indicating the difficulty in finding rotation-invariant, translation-invariant, and illumination-invariant face descriptors.

Original fractal representation, which requires less computational effort than principal component analysis (PCA), still necessitated recalculating feature vectors with new sample inclusion. Subsequent methods focus on reducing the computational footprint by simplifying 3D matrix representations into 1D feature vectors. However, these methods assume high-resolution images and lack defense against spoofing attacks.

This paper presents a new face representation method called FASIVA (Face Signature for Identification, Verification, and Authentication), which aims to robustly address identification, image enhancement, verification, and authentication.

The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 reviews previous work highlighting significant related studies. Section 3 explains the FASIVA signature in detail. Section 4 includes various implementations and the results achieved to validate the model. Lastly, Section 5 concludes with a summary and perspectives for future research.

The face representation is based on the principle of sparsity, seeking to minimize face matrix elements to obtain an accurate features vector. Several representation approaches, such as Local Binary Patterns (LBP), Eigenfaces, and Fisherfaces, are discussed. LBP, for instance, has sensitivity to illumination and occlusion due to its dependency on establishing binary patterns for pixels.

This study introduces techniques to mitigate the risks of adversarial attacks and proposes the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to handle coordinate-independent feature extraction. CNNs' capacity to detect spatial patterns makes them suitable for dealing with coordinates during frame transitions.

The paper describes how complex algorithms are designed using a top-down approach without fixed data representation, leveraging abstract data types and algebraic specifications to ensure authentic human presence.

The training data set specialized in human faces, chosen from the "Labeled Faces in the Wild" collection, consisted of 9,924 images for training and 3,309 for testing over 20 epochs. This specialization aims to enhance the system's ability to handle low-resolution images and add resilience against spoofing through super-resolution techniques and liveness detection like eye blinking.

Finally, the paper discusses the implementation of feature matching using algorithms such as k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM), emphasizing the use of a trained softmax layer for swift and efficient vector matching.

The FASIVA method's robustness is highlighted in its capacity to not only recognize faces but also improve image quality and prevent spoofing attacks through authentication procedures. Future work will delve deeper into enhancing blinking detection and guarding against adversarial assaults to further refine and strengthen the signatureâ€™s security measures.
