In this scholarly article, the authors discuss the utilization of virtual reality (VR) in education, highlighting how VR enables learners to create and engage with educational content through a sense of immersion, which effectively disconnects them from their physical surroundings. There is an emerging trend in exploring VR applications across various levels of education, as students benefit from visualizing abstract concepts, which can make difficult topics more accessible.

The paper emphasizes the value of educational VR mini-games, which offer interactive experiences with real-life problem simulations and convey clear learning objectives. The authors note that while VR has been researched in fields such as safety, travel, history, and engineering education, less is known about its role in teaching computational thinking (CT) and problem-solving.

The study poses a research question (RQ1) about the user-centered nature of a developed VR prototype, motivated by the limited examination of VR in CT education. Another research question (RQ3) addresses whether the VR intervention succeeds in fostering CT education and problem-solving skills.

Regarding teaching programming basics, Segura et al. (2020) introduced a VR game called VR-ocks, designed to draw young learners to computer science by fostering their interest in programming concepts like loops and conditional structures. The evaluation highlighted that learners in groups had better comprehension of these programming concepts.

The concept of recursion is crucial for problem-solving in CT. Recursion involves breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable parts, which can then be addressed iteratively. Prior knowledge and motivation are noted to influence students' understanding of recursion.

The paper suggests that traditional course designs and computer-based applications may offer limited engagement and interaction compared to an immersive VR game-based approach, which could improve student comprehension in CT.

Educational games are recognized both as teaching tools and as a means of entertainment that are interactive, reflective, and challenging. Recent studies suggest an upward trend in the development of educational games for an enhanced learning experience, as they promote engagement and interactive learning.

The authors developed the "iThinkSmart" VR application using the Unity engine, C#, and Firebase cloud services. This application can be run on smartphones inserted into simple cardboard head-mounted displays (HMDs) paired with a Bluetooth hand controller, offering an affordable and accessible educational platform.

Participants in the study were bachelor's and graduate students from diverse fields, some with no background in computer science or familiarity with VR mini-games. The iThinkSmart VR application targets African early university students entering computer science without prior knowledge.

The research involved semi-structured interviews with questions adapted from previous work to gather usability and experience data. Participants commented on the VR mini-games' features that enhanced usability, such as contextual sounds that facilitated interaction with game elements and challenges.

Feedback from pilot testing of the VR expedition mini-games indicated areas for improvement, such as sounds, graphics, game elements, challenges, navigation, and game pace. Despite unfamiliarity with some challenges, participants were motivated to engage and solve them. This finding echoes previous research that a well-designed VR learning environment can motivate learners to overcome difficulties, as exemplified by Google's educational VR applications that allow virtual field trips.

In summary, the paper outlines the potential benefits of VR in education, particularly in enhancing the engagement and understanding of CT and problem-solving concepts, and presents findings from a study on a specific VR educational game aimed at early university students in computer science.
