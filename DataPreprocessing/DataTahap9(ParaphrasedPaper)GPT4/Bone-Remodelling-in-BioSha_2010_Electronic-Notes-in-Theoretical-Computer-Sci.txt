The academic paper discusses bone tissue, an exceptional structural material forming the skeleton, divided into two primary types: cortical or compact bone, which is dense with blood vessels penetrating through canaliculi and commonly found in long bone shafts, and trabecular or cancellous bone, which is porous and located near joint surfaces, at the ends of long bones, and within vertebrae.

The paper emphasizes that bone can enhance its structural capacity without adding mass through mechanical stress, which influences the alignment of collagen fibers during the formation of new bone. This alignment varies depending on the type of mechanical stress appliedâ€”tensile or compressive.

On the cellular scale, bone remodeling is carried out by osteoclasts (OCs) and osteoblasts (OBs), which work together within a basic multicellular unit (BMU). The organization of BMUs varies between the two bone types but is more a morphological difference rather than a biological one. After OCs resorb bone, OBs begin to deposit a new bone matrix called osteoid and subsequently mineralize it. Some OBs become entrapped as osteocytes (OYs), while others continue synthesizing bone before becoming quiescent lining cells (LCs) that cover the new bone and connect with OYs via canaliculi.

The paper notes that bone remodeling has been extensively studied, often in isolation of components to understand their behavior, neglecting the role of how mechanical forces contribute to the adaptation of internal cellular architecture.

The challenge in bone mechanobiology is understanding how mechanical forces influence OB and OC activity. Current theories suggest that local regulatory mechanisms, involving local regulators and hormones (e.g., IGFs, cytokines IL-1, IL-6, and RANKL), control bone architecture but do not fully explain the cellular mechanisms of the remodeling process.

The authors propose to improve the predictiveness of cellular and tissue models by validating them with experimental and existing continuum-based descriptions of bone remodeling. They also intend to use their particle-based cellular model to validate continuum-based tissue models.

The paper describes the bioshape software, designed for running complex simulations requiring significant computational power through cluster and distributed computational methods, currently being ported to a MIMD architecture with message passing. It illustrates how a multiscale model can be defined using the primitives within the bioshape simulator.

The paper discusses the incorporation of shape density in simulations and how tensor fields applied to the tissue modify this density over time, influenced by mechanical stimuli and systemic factors like osteoblastic/osteoclastic activity and growth factor values.

Different from other frameworks and similar to bioshape, the paper highlights particle-based and single-scale approaches in Meredys that allow the inclusion of particle geometric information, representing biological entities as basic particles or compound objects. These particles diffuse through the simulation space and form bonds based on user-defined rules, with a collision detection algorithm determining the possibility of bond formation.

In conclusion, the paper discusses the complexity of bone remodeling from both the mechanical and cellular perspectives, highlighting the need for comprehensive models that can account for the multifaceted nature of these processes.
