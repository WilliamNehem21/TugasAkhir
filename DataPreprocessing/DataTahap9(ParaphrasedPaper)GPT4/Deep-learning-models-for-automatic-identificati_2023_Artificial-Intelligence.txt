The study adapted convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using transfer learning to classify diseases in multi-crop leaf images, achieving 98.40% accuracy for grape and 95.71% for tomato leaf diseases. They also extended the VGG-16 model for mango pest detection in Indonesia, achieving 73% and 76% accuracy on validation and test datasets, respectively. Additionally, they developed an enhanced CNN for real-time apple leaf disease detection, obtaining a mean average precision (mAP) of 78.80% with a specialized SSD incorporating the Inception module and rainbow concatenation. The study further examined the impact of various optimization techniques on CNN performance for olive disease classification without data augmentation, reaching up to 92.59% accuracy.

The research also covered a comprehensive evaluation of deep learning models for classifying plant-parasitic nematodes commonly found in Indonesian soil. The team compared four advanced models: ResNet101V2, CoAtNet-0, EfficientNetV2B0, and EfficientNetV2M. The models were assessed for their accuracy, and the influence of data augmentation and optimization functions on their performance was also analyzed. 

The paper details materials and methods in Section 2, results and comparisons of the four models in Section 3, and concludes in Section 4 with insights and potential directions for future research. The study used a dataset of 957 nematode samples (766 for training, 96 for validation, 95 for testing) and implemented augmentation techniques exclusively on the training set.

The EfficientNetV2 models achieved the best test accuracy of 97.94% with RMSprop optimizer and brightness augmented data. CoAtNet scores indicated higher data augmentation generalization capabilities than other model families. However, contrast augmentation decreased accuracy in most cases, suggesting it made the nematodes images unrealistic and potentially emphasized non-discriminatory features. Gaussian blurring seemed to help some model combinations by emphasizing general morphological features.

SGD optimizer performance varied; it performed well without augmentation but often declined with augmented data, suggesting a need for fine-tuning for augmented datasets. Conversely, adaptive optimizers like Adam generally matched or outperformed SGD under proper settings.

The paper concluded that not all augmentation types universally improve model performance, highlighting that augmentation might help simulate different data collection conditions but might not enhance morphological variance for improved class generalization.

Using the proposed methods, plant-parasitic nematodes can be identified quickly and reliably, with identification results delivered in as little as five seconds and accuracy reaching up to 97.94%. The current system limitation is that it recognizes only undamaged nematodes, reflecting the condition of the dataset, but future research aims to address broader conditions.
