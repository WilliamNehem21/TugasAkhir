In this research paper, the authors demonstrate how categorical logic tools can be applied to develop a comprehensive framework for modeling higher-order separation logic, which incorporates a subset of persistent predicates conforming to conventional higher-order logic principles. The foundation of separation logic models is the concept of a resource represented as a partial commutative monoid, and persistent predicates are identified via a particular modality. The paper categorizes consistent sublogics of persistent predicates by leveraging interior operators on this resource monoid. Additionally, the authors illustrate the application of this general framework to recreate the model used in Iris, a sophisticated higher-order separation logic, which includes guarded recursive predicates.

The paper refrains from delving into specific separation logics, like Hoare triples, invariants, and certain unique rules, focusing rather on the primary features of the logic. It utilizes complete Heyting algebras to represent standard higher-order logic and complete bi-algebras for higher-order separation logic, constructing these structures from a partial commutative monoid model and identifying idempotent elements.

Sections 3 and 4 examine conditions needed to develop a logic of persistent predicates, providing two distinct frameworks. The first is based on idempotent resources, creating a sublogic partially closed under some logical connectives but potentially lacking closure under the universal quantification of the overall logic. The second approach introduces a sublogic fully closed under the ambient logic's standard logical connectives, employing an interior operator on resources.

In Section 5, the authors argue that any sublogic focused solely on duplicable predicates and closed under all standard connectives must align with their second construction in Section 4. They also compare the expressiveness of the two types of sublogics studied and outline the necessary and sufficient conditions for the idempotent-based logic to be closed under universal quantification, a structure specified by the idempotents within the resource monoid.

The paper acknowledges that their described models do not inherently support guarded recursive predicates, as employed in Iris and other logics. To include these predicates, Iris's logic constructs are modeled within a subset of the topos of trees. This approach uses a step-indexed resource model known as a complete metric resource algebra (CMRA). Section 6 demonstrates that a CMRA, although appearing ad-hoc, can be canonically understood as a partial commutative monoid within a different ambient category. It asserts that modeling in the topos of trees allows for a faithful reconstruction of Iris predicate models using the frameworks from Sections 3 and 4.

The authors mention that for modalities in the logic to work well, such as preserving unions, they should also maintain the behaviors necessary to commute with existential quantification in logic. However, practical cases often show that this preservation is not guaranteed.

The paper suggests a solution to the issues caused by duplicable elements being approximated entirely by non-duplicable ones: focusing on predicates generated by duplicable principal ideals. This approach corresponds with the notion of a core in Iris, which is essential for a well-behaved modality and establishing a large, well-defined sublogic of persistent, duplicable predicates.

Finally, the authors aim to apply this categorical logic perspective to explore other model variations that integrate linear logic with separation logic and guarded recursive predicates. These integrations promise more accurate resource usage tracking, highlighted by recent research.
