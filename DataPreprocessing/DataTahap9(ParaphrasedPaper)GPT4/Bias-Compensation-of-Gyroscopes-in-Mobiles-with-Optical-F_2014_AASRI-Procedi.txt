This academic paper presents a novel method for correcting bias in gyroscopes, particularly for use in mobile phones. Gyroscopes in these devices suffer from drift due to bias in raw angular rate measurements which, when integrated, causes errors in estimating orientation. To mitigate this problem, the authors propose a solution that employs sensor fusion, combining gyroscope data with optical flow information from the device's camera.

An error model was created to analyze the bias and its impact on inertial sensing. The proposed bias compensation technique utilizes complementary filters together with an adaptive reliability filter for processing optical flow features. The final process involves fusing gyroscope data with feedback from the optical flow analysis to adjust for gyroscope bias.

Experimental results, which include real-world tests and simulations, have proven the effectiveness of the new fusion method, confirming its robustness and meeting the researchers' expectations. The technique was benchmarked using the Middlebury optical flow data, and the study also investigated the factors contributing to the accuracy of optical flow algorithms, finding that median filtering, while beneficial to performance, results in higher energy solutions.

For absolute orientation, the authors suggest using magnetometers to capture the third angle, but acknowledge that magnetic field distortions can often occur in certain environments, like near electronic devices or within buildings, which can mislead orientation estimates based on long-term trust in magnetometer readings.

The filtering algorithm employed by the authors consists of three main components, with a focus on the reliability of features and their integration with the bias-corrected gyroscope data. The complementary filter strikes a balance between the precision of optical flow results and the immediate changes detected by the gyroscope. Given that the ultimate angular rate output is intended for advanced orientation estimators, further complex filters are not applied within this solution.

Looking ahead, the paper outlines plans to explore additional methods for correlating gyroscope angular rates with optical flow feature displacements. This includes testing Kalman filters and RANSAC algorithms for optical flow processing, as well as experimenting with more refined techniques for aggregating reliable features, such as weighted median filters.
