The academic paper discusses the integration of axioms within the new concept construct of the upcoming C++0x standard (now known as C++11). Concepts in C++0x are intended to allow programmers to define constraints on template parameters, thereby enabling the specification of requirements like, for instance, a sort function demanding its argument to be an indexable collection with elements that can be compared using a less-than relationship.

The paper is structured to cover various aspects of axioms and their applications. It begins by explaining axioms, followed by their roles in the rewriting process and in testing. Implementation considerations are then addressed, and the paper concludes with a broader discussion and final thoughts.

One key proposal is that axioms should be flexible, permitting the usage of any statement within the axiom body, especially for testing purposes, and should be marked with the 'assert' keyword for clarity. Moreover, axioms could be declared outside of concepts, allowing them to be directly associated with classes without the need for separate concept and concept map declarations.

The paper further examines the application of rules to expressions within a program. To apply rules to an entire program, a rewriting strategy is necessary. Whether a rule succeeds or fails depends on whether the conditions match and are true. If a rule succeeds, the associated rewrite occurs. If it fails, other rules may be attempted. The paper also recognizes that a rewriting system based on C++ axioms is likely to be non-confluent and non-terminating, and suggests using rewrite strategies and axiom groups to manage rule application.

The potential for optimization through user-defined rewriting strategies is emphasized, as shown by Boyle's work with the TAMPR system. Strategies provide exact control over the application of rewrites to achieve optimization goals.

The process involves extracting axioms and strategy definitions from a program's syntax tree, converting axioms into rules that function at the concept level, and later at the class/user level following the application of concept maps. Testing procedures are initiated after these mappings.

The incorporation of optimization rules into programming is not novel. The paper references CodeBoost and its ability to handle conditions and multiple strategies. It also mentions rewrite rules from the Glasgow Haskell Compiler, and recognizes the influence of transformation languages like Stratego and Elan, as well as term rewriting systems, all of which support the use of strategies in various forms.
