The article discusses a proposed method for exploiting the data in IFC files to assist with indoor navigation. This approach includes enhancing the IFCOWL ontology to link user actions with different room types and accomplishing these goals efficiently. 

HTML, the core of the Web, is geared towards display instructions rather than organized data, placing the onus on users to manage information navigation and overload. The Semantic Web aims to make data more understandable to both humans and machines, fostering semantic interoperability through increasingly sophisticated knowledge representation. 

Challenges in converting IFC to OWL, which handles information differently, have been documented. Various custom conversions exist, and a standard is needed for optimal ontology use. Early IFC to OWL conversions were rudimentary, but subsequent studies have proposed improved methodologies, with IFCOWL being significant. Enhancements like additional classes to explain existing relationships and alternative geometric data representations, such as WKT serialization, have also been suggested. 

The method involves using IFCOWL in conjunction with indoor navigation technologies, sensory data, and algorithms. It improves upon existing IFC search strategies by creating semantic maps that enrich navigation with high-level information and environmental object relationships. Novel ontological properties have been introduced to manage geometric data and determine the global positions of elements.

Knowing different room types, like kitchens or bedrooms, is crucial for navigation but isn't explicit in IFC files. The scheme can infer probable locations of rooms by their contents. Room types can be expanded and differentiated within the ontology, with properties linking rooms to their typical elements.

Integrating with existing ontologies, like IndoorGML from the Open Geospatial Consortium, can enhance the model's topological aspects. Cross-referencing IFC entities like spaces and walls with IndoorGML can optimize the data subset for navigation.

The paper proposes leveraging the IFCOWL ontology and BIM files, enriched with sensor data, to advance indoor navigation. By introducing new items, deduction rules, and queries, this methodology allows deducing room types and navigating to specific destinations within a building.
