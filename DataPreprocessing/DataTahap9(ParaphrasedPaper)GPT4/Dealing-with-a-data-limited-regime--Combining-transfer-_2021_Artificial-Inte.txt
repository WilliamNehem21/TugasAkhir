The ability of water to dissolve substances, known as aqueous solubility, is crucial in both chemical and biological contexts. Predicting solubility through computational methods is a tough task that has captivated researchers for many years. Recent investigations have utilized a variety of techniques, including models based on fingerprints, features, and graphs, and employed both machine learning and deep learning. Although numerous traditional prediction methods exist, they often depend on expertly crafted features, which can limit their effectiveness.

Another challenge in this field is the poor-quality dataset for aqueous solubility, which can hinder the training of sophisticated deep learning models. In response to these challenges, this study introduces an advanced, structure-based predictive method by creating a novel deep learning network architecture. This new model leveraged transfer learning to enhance its performance. Remarkably, the developed model achieved a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.587, demonstrating its accuracy in both cross-validation and external tests using data from the online chemical database and modeling environment (OCHEM).

Further exemplifying the model's capabilities, the system was successful at detecting patterns linked to aqueous solubility within chemical structures, such as a particular combination of atoms and functional groups, indicating the model's ability to learn meaningful molecular representations.

Despite the inherent difficulties of scaffold splitting—a scenario where the training and test sets are structurally diverse—the proposed model, referred to as TunedM2M, showed competence. Whereas randomly splitting data for training and testing tends to give better performance, TunedM2M was still able to extract generalizable features from molecular structures to offer solid predictions, as evidenced by an MSE (mean square error) of 0.48.

Beyond its success in predicting solubility, this research's method could be beneficial in modeling other chemical or biological properties, particularly when limited data is available for training models.
