Information and communication technology (ICT) systems play a pivotal role in modern power systems, once limited mainly to office tasks but now increasingly integrated with automation, control, and protection operations. These smart grids offer superior adaptability and functionality, facilitating both regular operations and contingencies in the grid, aligning with strategic goals and fulfilling future demands.

The focus of this study is to explore the interconnectedness of power and ICT systems and their impact on reliability, using research from the past five years found in prominent journals. The paper categorizes types of interdependencies and assesses methodologies used in analyzing them, emphasizing risk analysis and critical infrastructure modeling methods.

The study involved a structured literature review from three major journals published since 2010, revealing diverse approaches and scope. The research, still in the initial stages, tests hypotheses but lacks real-world evaluations. 

Interdependencies consist of various failure types: common cause, where one reason triggers failures in both systems; cascading, a failure in one system sparks a downfall in another; and escalating, where an existing failure exacerbates another failure. Analyzed papers range in focus, including ones that evaluate specific ICT component failures on power system reliability.

The paper underscores the need for combined expertise in power systems, ICT, and analytical methods to understand interdependencies. Simplicity in modeling facilitates interdisciplinary cooperation, yet there's a tension between a model's ease of use and its comprehensive detail. Empirical data is scarce in the reviewed research, possibly due to confidentiality issues, yet analyzing past failures and incidents remains a valuable learning tool.

Interdependencies already affect power system reliability, a trend set to intensify with the smart grid evolution. Current methods fall short in addressing the variety and complexity of threats and interdependency types. The paper recommends future research improve on existing methodologies, including interdependency identification, to support transmission system operators (TSOs) and distribution system operators (DSOs) in recognizing and managing their impact.
