The significance of the food supply chain became increasingly evident following the World Health Organization's announcement of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. Global food supply chains faced disruptions due to lockdowns and restrictions by governments. In the US, the CDC reported substantial COVID-19 cases and deaths among meat processing workers, highlighting the vulnerability of these essential industries. Similarly, China found the virus on imported beef from countries such as Australia, Brazil, New Zealand, and Bolivia, leading to import bans and adverse impacts on trade and tariffs.

This academic paper focuses on the future of food safety, particularly through traceability-based solutions, an area previously unexplored in global bibliometric analysis. The paper presents a comprehensive review of developments in food safety and traceability, using the Scopus database for bibliometric analysis of publications. Key findings include trends in publications over time, contributions by various nations and organizations, author collaborations, and highly cited documents. The study outlines the dynamics of scientific research and international cooperation in this field, largely showing an increase from 2014, with significant contributions from China, the US, and European Union countries.

VOSviewer software is highlighted for its superiority in visualizing bibliometric maps when a large dataset is present, and the bibliometrix R-package is noted for its comprehensive science mapping capabilities. The analysis found that certain institutions and researchers, including those from Jiangsu University and China Agricultural University, are notably impactful in the field.

The paper notes a trend of growing international collaboration between the US and China and underscores the advancing science in China and its collaboration with G7 countries. Limitations of the study include reliance on the Scopus database, which is subject to change, suggesting the potential utility of combining multiple databases for a more accurate reflective research landscape.
