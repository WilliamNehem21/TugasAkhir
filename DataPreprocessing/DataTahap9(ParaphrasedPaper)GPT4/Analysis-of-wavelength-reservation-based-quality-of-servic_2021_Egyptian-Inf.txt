The paper discusses techniques for reserving wavelength channels and algorithms for scheduling wavelengths in Optical Burst Switching (OBS) networks, as well as proposing a model for Quality of Service (QoS) differentiation via wavelength reservation.

In OBS networks, signaling methods for reserving wavelengths can be divided into immediate and delayed reservation types. Immediate reservation, exemplified by JIT (Just-In-Time) protocol, locks a wavelength channel as soon as the burst control packet is processed. In contrast, delayed reservation, used by the JET (Just-Enough-Time) protocol, only secures the channel for the precise duration of the data burst, leading to improved bandwidth utilization and lower burst loss probability (BLP) compared to JIT, despite its higher computational demand at core nodes.

Wavelength scheduling in OBS is either non-void filling or void filling. Non-void filling algorithms like FFUC (First Fit Unscheduled Channel) and LAUC (Latest Available Unscheduled Channel) prioritize reducing the gap or 'void' between data bursts on a wavelength. Void filling algorithms weren't specified but typically aim to pack bursts into available gaps to optimize channel usage.

Burst loss from contention is a major issue in OBS, as the technology does not use buffers. The paper recognizes the significance of QoS differentiation mechanisms to mitigate the impact of contention. In these networks, higher priority traffic can be given more resources, meaning greater wavelength reservation, thus reducing burst loss but potentially increasing it for lower priority traffic.

An analytical model is put forward in the paper for wavelength reservation-based QoS differentiation in OBS networks. It is first tested for a single class system and then extended for a multi-class setup. Simulations assess the effect of prioritizing traffic classes on BLP, finding that traffic classes with more assigned wavelengths have fewer burst losses. Conversely, classes with fewer wavelengths encounter more severe burst losses.

In summary, the paper addresses OBS network challenges related to channel reservation, scheduling, and burst loss, proposing and validating a QoS differentiation method based on wavelength reservation to alleviate these problems.
