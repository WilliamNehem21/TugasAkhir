In an academic paper, the authors discuss a method of constructing c.e. sets that are non-repeating by borrowing a concept originally introduced by Friedberg. Friedberg's approach involved the idea of arranging c.e. sets in a sequence, where one set follows another. This leads to the eventual formation of a c.e. set that is the "followed set." The authors adopt similar terminology in their discussion, although they apply this concept to trees following one another rather than sets.

They describe a process where at each even-numbered level of a tree (labeled "2i"), the elements or nodes are unique and different from one another. During a particular stage denoted as "i," some elements (referred to as "si") may be tagged as "marked" (denoted "ki= m"). If an element is marked, it will indefinitely follow a designated tree specified as "t(si,m)." If an element is not marked (indicated by "ki= n"), it is then assessed to determine whether it should be marked. If it's decided that an element "si" requires marking, the element will be assigned to a tree "t(si,m)" to follow from that point on. If an element does not need marking, it continues following its preset tree "t(si,n)." Once these decisions are made and paths are designated for all "si," the stage is complete.
