The academic paper discusses a trilinear system for image security that employs logistic and cubic maps to generate six entirely random bijections: t1(x), t2(x), t2(y), t3(x), t3(y), and t3(z). These maps are utilized to perform various functions in image encryption: t1(x) rearranges the pixels in the image, t2(x) and t2(y) alter the pixel positions, while the remaining three maps change the pixel values. By doing this, the correlations between the RGB components of the image are diminished.

The paper explains that a color image comprises numerous pixels arranged in lines and segments, each with a specific value that contributes to the image's overall diversity. To protect the image, it is represented as three numerical matrixes, corresponding to its small areas and colors. Image encryption is critical for safeguarding sensitive images from potential attacks.

Chaos theory is applied to image encryption due to its high security and sensitivity to initial parameters, which results in unpredictable outcomes. The first chaotic system was introduced by Matthews in 1989, and since then, many scientific algorithms have been developed for image encryption, typically using one or two-dimensional chaotic systems with few secret parameters. However, this paper claims to improve upon those techniques by offering a completely irregular multi-layered framework with multiple secret parameters, which effectively encrypts RGB images and their components simultaneously.

Furthermore, the paper presents an encryption method that is highly sensitive to changes in the input image; even a single-bit difference in two input images will result in substantially different output images.
