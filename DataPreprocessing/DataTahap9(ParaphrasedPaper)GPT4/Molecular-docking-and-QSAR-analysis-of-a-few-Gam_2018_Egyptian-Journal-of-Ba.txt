Epilepsy is a widely recognized neurological disorder affecting an estimated 65 to 75 million people globally, including 10.5 million children. The prevalence of epilepsy worldwide ranges from 2.8 to 19.5 cases per 1,000 individuals and is typified by the chronic nature of recurring disruptions in the nervous system. These disruptions arise from the sudden and disorganized firing of neurons, leading to immediate sensory disturbances and potentially a loss of consciousness. Seizures, often prompted by epilepsy, can present diverse symptoms depending on the affected brain regions, such as full or partial loss of consciousness, impaired speech, and uncontrollable body movements.

The study further examines the interaction of protein-ligand complexes formed by certain quinoxaline and thiadiazoles derivatives, which have been shown to inhibit the gamma-aminobutyric acid-transaminase (GABAAT) enzyme associated with epilepsy. Using discovery studio visualizer 4.1, LigPlot, and PyMOL software, the team analyzed these interactions, including hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic engagement, selecting the conformation with the highest binding score for further examination.

According to the statistical model presented in the paper, an increase in certain physiochemical parameters, such as MinHBInt4 (minimum hydrogen bonding potential at path length 4), Eta_alpha (sum of alpha values for all non-hydrogen atoms), and Grav-5 (gravitational index), corresponds positively to heightened anticonvulsant activity (PED50 values) of these chemical derivatives. On the other hand, the negative correlation of descriptors like DPSA-1 (difference in total polar surface area) and WT.ENeg (electron negativity weighted by atomic positions) implies that a decrease in these factors could enhance the inhibitory potential of the compounds.

The paper further discusses the impact of descriptors on the efficacy of the inhibitors. The DPSA-1 descriptor indicates a molecule's global and local electrophilicity characteristics especially relevant in non-covalent molecular interactions and can also reflect a compound's binding affinity for the estrogen receptor. Reduction in DPSA-1 values leads to heightened inhibitory activity against GABAAT. The analysis suggests that appropriate consideration of binding affinity and atomic electronegativity, as reflected by the descriptors, is crucial for effectively impeding GABAAT enzyme activity, which is implicated in epilepsy.

The investigation demonstrates that physiochemical properties like MinHBInt4, Eta_alpha, DPSA-1, Grav-5, and WT.ENeg are pivotal factors driving the inhibitory action of quinoxaline and thiadiazoles derivatives against the GABAAT enzyme. Docking analysis exhibited that compound 5a, in particular, showed a higher docking score indicating strong binding affinity. The research concludes that the robustness and practical application of the QSAR (Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship) models used are validated through internal and external methods, establishing the fundamental structural features responsible for the inhibition of GABAAT by the studied compounds.
