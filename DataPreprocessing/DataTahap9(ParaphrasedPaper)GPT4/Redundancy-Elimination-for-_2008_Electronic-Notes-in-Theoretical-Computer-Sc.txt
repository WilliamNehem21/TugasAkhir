The academic paper describes a process where an entity "p" is systematically transferred into "p'", until "p" becomes empty, leaving only "p'" and another entity "q". According to the established rule or condition (the invariant), the empty state of "p" indicates that there are no variables left to consider. Consequently, both "p'" and "q" are complete or self-contained, enabling direct verification. The paper notes a challenge, however: verification involves recursively applying the type-checking algorithm to "q". However, it is observed that the algorithm is designed to ensure that each recursive call to type-check on "q" deals with a type-checking problem that is smaller than the previous one.
