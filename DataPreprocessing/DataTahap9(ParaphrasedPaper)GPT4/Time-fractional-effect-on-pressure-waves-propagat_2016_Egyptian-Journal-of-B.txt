The pliability of red blood cells primarily contributes to the characteristic of blood acting as a Newtonian fluid. Studies have noted that blood exhibits Newtonian fluid properties under conditions of elevated shear rates. It has been observed that the viscosity of blood is sufficiently low that it can often be overlooked in comparison to its nonlinear characteristics. Based on these findings, it is reasonable to approximate blood as a fluid that is both incompressible and without viscosity.
