The referenced academic paper indicates that all internal components of a certain structure exhibit commutativity. For the left-hand segment, refer to section 3.4, and for part (i), refer to section 3.1. The bottom segment of the structure is obviously commutative, as determined through individual examination of its two elements. Similarly, the central triangular section is also commutative. It is necessary to confirm the commutativity of the top segment; this is accomplished by applying the principles from sections 3.1 and 3.5, leading to the conclusion that the specified diagram commutes.
