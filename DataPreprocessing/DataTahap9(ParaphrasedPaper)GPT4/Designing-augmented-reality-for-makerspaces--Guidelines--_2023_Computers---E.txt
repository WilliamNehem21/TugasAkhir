Augmented reality (AR) technology, which fuses physical objects with virtual information, is increasingly being leveraged in education to improve learning and collaboration in spaces designed for creative and hands-on activities, known as makerspaces. The integration of AR in makerspaces is anticipated to grow because it aligns well with the interactive and innovation-focused nature of these environments.

Literature indicates that AR has the potential to make educational tasks more efficient, simplify cognitive processing, and foster better comprehension and teamwork. Nevertheless, one significant hurdle in employing AR for educational purposes is the lack of design guidelines for its effective application in complex settings such as makerspaces. Developing AR applications is costly, ranging from $50,000 to $250,000, which can inhibit the widespread adoption of AR due to financial constraints.

To optimize the use of AR in these contexts, certain best practices are recommended, including:

1. Augmenting tangible objects to take advantage of users' pre-existing physical world knowledge.
2. Creating AR visuals that fit seamlessly with physical objects, possibly utilizing sensors for interactive visuals.
3. Assessing when AR is unnecessary, as it may not add value to certain tasks.
4. Offering various visualization types to cater to learners with different levels of understanding.
5. Anchoring AR content to physical objects to capitalize on learners' prior knowledge and encourage interaction with learning content.
6. Aiming for visual minimalism to prevent information overload. 
7. Clearly explaining visual representations to users, especially when educational facilitators are absent.
8. Leveraging users' existing knowledge from other technologies to ease the transition to AR experiences.

Researchers recommend soliciting feedback from those unfamiliar with AR technology to stimulate fresh ideas that can guide development. This feedback can help identify what works well and what doesn't, contributing to a more user-friendly AR experience.

This body of research presents 14 design guidelines derived from various AR experiences in makerspace settings, informing designers about supporting social collaboration, merging virtual and physical content, promoting conceptual understanding, and enhancing usability. The hope is that these guidelines will assist designers in making informed choices when incorporating AR in different open-ended learning environments such as factories, laboratories, workshops, and engineering settings.

Challenges addressed in the research also involve determining the appropriate amount of AR visualization to provide a balance between visibility of vital information and avoiding unnecessary clutter. Another important aspect is user agency, where designers need to find the right balance between guidance and freedom for optimal user engagement.

The research acknowledges that these guidelines are based on studies with specific demographics and controlled settings, suggesting a need for further validation in diverse contexts. It is also recognized that AR technology and makerspace environments will evolve, necessitating continuous updates to the guidelines.

Confidentiality and ethical considerations were strictly adhered to in the studies, with approval from the institution's review board and anonymization of participant data.

The findings sit within a broader context of open-ended learning environments, which prioritize designs that are adaptable to learners' varying backgrounds and interests, and can facilitate a diversity of social interactions and engagement levels.
