The paper discusses blending model checking with deductive reasoning to address limitations of each method individually. The authors aim to integrate Multiway Decision Graphs (MDGs) within an LCF-style theorem prover, by representing MDG operations—conjunction, disjunction, relational product, and prune-by-subsumption—as inference rules. They implement reachability analysis within the HOL theorem prover using these rules, and present experiments that showcase the performance of this approach, demonstrating automation benefits without significantly increasing computation time or memory.

Model checking often encounters a state explosion problem when verifying complex systems. The paper emphasizes the practice of applying model checking to software, despite challenges such as the state explosion problem and the semantic gap between software development and verification tools.

The authors propose embedding an alternate representation for MDGs within the theorem prover, which enhances security by utilizing the theorem prover's infrastructure. Experimental results show that while this approach entails considerable initial effort, the automated platform can deliver efficient verification without sacrificing theorem prover security.

The paper is structured to review related work, provide preliminaries on MDGs and the HOL system, elaborate on well-formedness conditions, present basic MDG operations as inference rules, describe the reachability analysis tactic in HOL, and finally, discuss the results and future research directions.

Different verification techniques, either standalone or combined, help tackle technological challenges in software and hardware verification. The authors' research is motivated by the potential benefits of merging different techniques. They extend HOL with MDG-specific operations and show that although this extension may slightly reduce efficiency, it maintains the system's soundness.

The paper then details how MDGs, which include abstract data types and uninterpreted functions, offer a higher level of abstraction and a more compact representation than Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs). The authors' work differs from previous efforts by embedding MDG operations as inference rules within the theorem prover, rather than linking an external MDG library. This could lead to a more seamlessly integrated system for future tool platforms.

The authors explain the formalization of MDG operations within HOL and present experimental results to support the effectiveness of their platform, highlighting better performance in comparison to existing model checking tools, despite requiring significant human effort. They suggest that the formalism laid out in the paper can serve as a foundation for a HOL-based model checker and potentially provide a formal proof of the MDG model checking approach.
