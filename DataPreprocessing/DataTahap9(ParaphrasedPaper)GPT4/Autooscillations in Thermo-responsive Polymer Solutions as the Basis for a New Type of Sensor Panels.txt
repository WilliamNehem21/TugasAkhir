Experimental research has demonstrated that stable self-oscillating patterns can form in thermo-responsive polymer solutions subjected to thermal gradients. The paper provides a theoretical explanation for the phenomena observed and suggests their application in creating novel sensory interfaces.

The fascination with self-organization in responsive polymer solutions is partly due to their potential to unlock secrets of prebiotic evolution, shedding light on the origins of life on Earth.

The focus of this study is a 2% solution of a copolymer composed of N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAm) and acrylic acid (AA) in a 90:10 molar ratio at a pH of 7.6, with investigations conducted between temperatures of 26°C and 40°C. This particular solution undergoes a sharp phase transition at approximately 32°C, marked by a significant increase in turbidity, indicating a change in macromolecule solubility. Turbidimetry, which measures the intensity of light passing through a solution, is utilized to monitor the soluble and insoluble states of the macromolecules.

The paper explains that these conditions set the stage for a previously unknown type of wave phenomenon within the liquid. It is highlighted that these responsive environments can be converted to a solid film through crosslinking agents, facilitating the formation of a gel-like polymer network. Notably, these oscillatory waves can be detected via both optical and electrical means, owing to a marked change in the solution's specific resistance that accompanies the loss of solubility and consequent decrease in macromolecule ionization.
