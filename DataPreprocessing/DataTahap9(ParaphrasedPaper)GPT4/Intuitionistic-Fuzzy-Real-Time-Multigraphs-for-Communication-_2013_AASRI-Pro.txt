Multigraphs, which come in two variants—undirected and directed—have distinct characteristics. In undirected multigraphs, the connections between any two nodes i and j are considered the same regardless of their direction, whereas in directed multigraphs, the direction substantially differentiates the edges (i, j) and (j, i). For recent advancements in multigraph algebra, sources [4, 11, 13] offer essential insights into this area of study.

Considering a particular node u, it is deemed communicable at a certain moment if it has a non-empty set of incident edges (denoted as iu), with at least one being non-zero. If node u lacks neighboring nodes, its set iu is empty, indicating that no communication can proceed henceforth. Alternatively, when iu exists but consists solely of null vectors at a certain time, this condition reflects a temporary cessation of possible communications.
