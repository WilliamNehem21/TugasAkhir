Our research focuses on orthomodular structures derived from the states of finite automata, referred to as regions, which represent local states within a distributed, concurrent system potentially modelable by a Petri net. The key finding is that these structures possess sufficient elements to capture the intersection (meet) of select subsets of elements.

We examine a specific type of orthomodular structures associated with finite automata state subsets. These regions provide a local perspective distinct from the global states of an automata and relate to the field of Petri nets, which was developed by Carl Adam Petri to incorporate system theory principles drawn from physics, including special relativity.

Considering a net N = (B, E, F), we define K = IP(B) as the power set of B, with its elements termed cases of N. These cases represent possible global states the system modeled by N can achieve. System state changes are driven by the transition occurrences governed by the defined firing rule.

Regions, subsets of the global states where a specific condition holds true, represent local states within a system described by its transition system. Each region corresponds to true or false conditions within a global state.

We explore two mappings: 'h' which connects a coherent, prime orthomodular poset to a transition system, and 'j', which facilitates the reverse. It has been previously established that 'j(p)' is a member of the class of CE (condition/event) transition systems and that a given CE transition system 'a' is embeddable in 'jh(a)' with a comparable association for 'p' in 'hj(p)', where embedding is based on an accepted form of morphism.
