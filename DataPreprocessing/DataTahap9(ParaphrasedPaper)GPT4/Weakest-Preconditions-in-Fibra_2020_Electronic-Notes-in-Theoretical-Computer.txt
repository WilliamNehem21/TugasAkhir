This academic paper discusses the relationship between algebraic structures used in the study of computational effects and certain category-theoretic concepts. It highlights how the connection between categories of algebraic structures over a slicing object and fibered functors simplifies understanding how monads can be transferred across fibrations. The paper also connects predicate transformers, particularly the strongest postcondition predicate transformers, with their counterparts in domain fibrations and outlines the conditions for their existence.

Additionally, the paper extends previous work to include the cartesian lifting of composite monads and pairs of Eilenberg-Moore monotone algebras. An extra coherence law is necessary for this extension, which provides a systematic approach to determining cartesian liftings of complex monads.

Furthermore, the study leads to a way to lift monads and weakest precondition predicate transformers (wppts) from their respective algebras. It also sets out a way to create transformers for combined monads by merging individual algebras.

The paper applies these concepts by examining predicate transformers for various well-known monads, such as the maybe monad, the non-empty powerset monad, the counting monad, the distribution monad, and the indexed distribution monad. By combining different transformers, the paper shows how to reconstruct known predicate transformers from the literature, specifically citing the work of Kaminski et al. on the expected runtime transformer and Kura et al. on the higher-order moment transformer.
