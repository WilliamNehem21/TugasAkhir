The academic paper discusses the evolution of data models over recent years. Initially, semantic data models emerged as tools for design, making it easier to capture the application semantics. With time, certain models such as the nested relational, object-oriented, and object-relational models gained prominence as standalone data models. Subsequent research has adapted dependency and normalization theories to these sophisticated data models. More current research focuses on semi-structured data and XML, with particular attention to XML integrity constraints. A significant research challenge is the creation of dependency theories, or ideally, a comprehensive theory, for these advanced data models.

In the context of a practical example, the paper might describe a database with a 'product' relation that records items and corresponding customer names for each purchase. It could also include 'total' for the total sales price, 'nord' for the number of orders, 'nprod' for the number of products, and 'nship' for the number of shipments. The database designer may outline specific constraints to ensure the database's integrity and accurate representation of the real-world application it models.
