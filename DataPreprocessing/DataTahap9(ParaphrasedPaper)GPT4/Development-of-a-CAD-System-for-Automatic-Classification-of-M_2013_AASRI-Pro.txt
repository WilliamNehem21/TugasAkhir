The study revealed that the implemented system was effective in identifying microcalcifications from various categories. Throughout the evaluation phase, the system did not register any false positives. Additionally, it successfully detected all microcalcifications in every single test image, even when noise was introduced to the images. The average time for processing an image was approximately 2.7 seconds. Execution of the system on the Altera DE2-115 board did not present any issues, suggesting it as a viable platform for developing a Computer-Aided Detection (CAD) system that is more cost-effective, compact, and energy-efficient compared to those running on conventional computers.
