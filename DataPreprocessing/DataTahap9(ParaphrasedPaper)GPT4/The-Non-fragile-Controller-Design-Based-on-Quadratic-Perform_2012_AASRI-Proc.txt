The paper discusses a method for designing control systems that are robust to certain types of uncertainties, particularly in the context of changing controller gains. The authors present a method to design state feedback controllers that are non-fragileâ€”meaning they maintain performance despite small changes in controller parameters. They provide the necessary and sufficient conditions for such controllers to exist and demonstrate how to find them by solving Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) problems, which makes the process of obtaining non-fragile controllers more systematic. The effectiveness of the method is supported by flight control simulation results.

Recognizing that no system model can perfectly represent a real-life engineering system, the paper references previous studies that have focused on optimal control problems in the presence of system and external uncertainties. These problems extend the concept of linear quadratic optimization by including system uncertainties. Control methods that address both the uncertainty in the system being controlled and the resulting performance of the closed-loop system are known as guaranteed cost control.

This body of work on robust control deals with the stability of the control system, considering that the system includes both the plant being controlled and the controller itself. The research suggests that there is an interplay between robustness, which is the ability to handle uncertainties in the system, and non-fragility, which is the resistance to the controller's own uncertainties. A key insight from Keel et al. (1997) is that higher-order controllers tend to be more fragile, highlighting the significance of accounting for controller uncertainty in the design process. These findings support the need for non-fragile control approaches that can handle these uncertainties effectively during the design and synthesis of controllers.
