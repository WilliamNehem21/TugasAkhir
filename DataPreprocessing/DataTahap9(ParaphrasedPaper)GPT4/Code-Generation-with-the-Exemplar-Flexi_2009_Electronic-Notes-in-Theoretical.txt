The paper discusses an increasingly favored approach to developing software product lines, which involves using code generation. This method produces executable code from higher-level, domain-specific language (DSL) specifications. However, while DSLs are designed to be as abstract as possible for ease of use by domain experts, this abstraction creates a challenge for compiler developers who need to translate these specifications into code. To remedy this, the paper introduces a novel approach that uses analogies, generating new software by modifying existing products within the same domain instead of building from scratch or translating DSL specifications.

The proposed Exemplar Flexibilization Language (EFL) offers new operators to address the constraints of regular expressions and aids in integrating parsers for handling complex exemplar modifications. EFL allows the creation of crosscutting generators (which deal with variability across the exemplar) and supports both decomposition and combination of generators.

The paper is organized as follows: a summary of EFL, its capabilities in surpassing regular expression limitations, applications of EFL in generative programming, and a conclusion of the presented work.

A rapid method for building DSL interpreters involves embedding the DSL into a dynamic general-purpose language like Ruby. This allows DSLs to leverage the host language's features but requires DSL syntax to conform to the host language's syntax. EFL capitalizes on Ruby's extensibility to create reasonably user-friendly syntax.

Regular expressions engines are classified into deterministic finite automaton (DFA) and nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA) types. Although the way regular expressions are written doesn't affect DFA engines, NFA engines' behavior is contingent on the structure of these expressions. Most programming languages implement NFA engines because they allow more programmer control and offer advanced features like capture groups and lazy quantifiers.

Crafting complex and efficient regular expressions for NFA engines is tricky. EFL simplifies this with the "zoom operator" (>) that aids in step-by-step construction of regular expressions. Furthermore, EFL leverages Ruby's metaprogramming to automate repetitive tasks, like generating regular expressions for balanced parentheses.

The capabilities and limitations of various tools and languages that create generators are assessed, and EFL is presented as a solution that overcomes some critical limitations. EFL is posited not as a replacement for these tools but as complementary to them and can be easily integrated with various existing tools and languages.
