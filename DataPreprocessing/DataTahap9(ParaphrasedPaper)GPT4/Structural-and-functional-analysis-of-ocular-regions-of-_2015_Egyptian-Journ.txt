The paper discusses the adaptation of fish vision to their aquatic environments, particularly for species living at varying depths of the ocean where light absorption alters visibility. Fish have specialized eyes with oval-shaped lenses and retinas comprising rod and/or cone photoreceptors, depending on their need for scotopic (low-light) or photopic (bright-light) vision. In deep-sea environments, fish eyes are adapted to the darkness, and at around 50 meters deep, the light spectrum shifts primarily to blue.

The study examines differences in fish vision through various assessments. Proteins in fish lenses, particularly gammacrystallins, which are associated with refractive index gradients, were studied through SDS-PAGE profiles. The paper highlights the importance of lens protein content and its relationship to vision quality in marine teleost fishes occupying different depths.

Retinal structure and thickness were measured, and fish were classified as nocturnal or diurnal based on the ratio of certain retinal layers (outer and inner nuclear, ganglion layers). Fish lenses were examined using electron microscopy after being processed with glutaraldehyde, ethyl alcohol, and coated with gold.

Protein analyses were conducted using a Lowry method and electrophoresis. Isoenzyme patterns were distinguished by mobility rates, with varying band presence serving as differentiators.

The retina of marine fishes consists of ten identifiable layers, with significant variations observed among species regarding retinal thickness and layer architecture. The study describes how these variations appear to correspond to differences in diurnal and nocturnal habits and visual acuity.

Specific species display adaptations suitable to their preferred habitats—some are adapted to deeper sea levels, while others like the hippocampus species are found in coastal regions or on soft bottoms among rocks and algae, showing nocturnal feeding behaviour.

Photoreceptor adaptations are also noted, with some species showing different arrangements of cones and rods, indicating various visual systems and acuity levels.

The study observes retinomotor movements in response to light changes, documented changes in eye and retina size between nocturnal and diurnal fish forms, and the effects on retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and photoreceptors.

Protein analyses of fish lenses and retinas revealed structural diversity, which reflected in the lens fibers’ arrangement and supported retinal structure variations. Increased acid phosphatase isoenzyme levels associated with intense melanosome activity suggest functional significance in light absorption and free radical scavenging.

In conclusion, the paper outlines significant findings about the structural and functional variations in fish vision systems, highlighting how they are intricately adapted to their specific marine environments and the implications for their respective visual capabilities.
