India has one of the world's highest rates of oral cancer, which is the most common cancer in Indian men and the third most common in women. The disease often goes undetected until later stages, leading to a low five-year survival rate for advanced oral cancer, which presents a significant public health issue.

The role of bidi smoking and smokeless tobacco (SLT) is well-documented in India. Studies have shown that the risk associated with bidi smoking is greater than that of cigarette smoking. The harmful effects are heightened by the fact that bidi smoke promotes the expression of enzymes that break down collagen, such as MMP2 and MMP-9, increasing the likelihood of cancer metastasis. The risk is even greater for individuals who regularly use both bidi and cigarettes.

Although data is scarce for India, age and cultural background play critical roles in oral health, which affects the quality of life. Poor oral hygiene is a key factor in cancer development, alongside tobacco and betel quid consumption. While younger individuals show fewer caries and restorations, poor oral health, including tooth loss, cavities, gum disease, dry mouth, and oral precancer/cancer, is prevalent in older populations. Improved oral health awareness is necessary in India, where a positive correlation exists between dental health awareness, attitudes, oral hygiene practices, and socio-economic status. Poor oral health is also identified as an independent risk factor for oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). The study underlines the influence of educational levels on oral health, indicating the need to consider education when assessing risk and designing preventive strategies, as health literacy impacts oral health. Thus, oral health literacy and hygiene are important factors when assessing the risk for oral precancer and cancer.

Fuzzy logic is an approach that handles uncertainty in systems by incorporating human assessments into problems that are not suitably addressed by traditional computing methods. By utilizing natural language predicates to represent incomplete information flexibly, fuzzy logic allows for the modelling of complex systems with imprecision tolerance.

In this study, fuzzy numbers are defined to convert qualitative linguistic terms into quantifiable data, promoting a more abstract system modelling based on knowledge and experience.

The study focused on the diverse population in the Terai and Dooars regions of Northern West Bengal, which, despite their cultural variety, including ethnic groups like Nepali, Bhutia, Mech, Rajbanshi, Lepcha, Rava, Drupka, and Sherpa, have not been extensively studied regarding their oral health.
