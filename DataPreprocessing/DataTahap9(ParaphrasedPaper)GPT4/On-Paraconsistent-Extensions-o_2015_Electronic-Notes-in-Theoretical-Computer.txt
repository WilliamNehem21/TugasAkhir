This paper examines the extension of logic C1 into a larger paraconsistent logic while retaining certain desired properties and the substitution theorem. Researchers highlight that C1, a paraconsistent logic, cannot be expanded into a paraconsistent logic where the substitution theorem holds true. However, by introducing specific axioms, C1 can evolve into more extensive paraconsistent logics. The paper discusses how three-valued logics are utilized to substantiate these assertions.

Choosing axioms for a logical system typically aims for their independence -- no axiom should be derivable from others. Although multi-valued logics can aid in this process, limitations exist. The paper notes the practical implications of paraconsistent logics, particularly in managing inconsistencies within systems and in non-monotonic reasoning, two areas that have yet to be fully explored.

Paraconsistent logics are characterized by their ability to handle non-trivial inconsistent theories while preserving as much of classical logic as possible. They should not endorse inferences that classical logic would reject and should operate within the bounds of classical logic.

Classical logic's role in artificial intelligence applications is well established. This research delves into various paraconsistent logics to determine their resemblance to classical logic. While the desirable substitution theorem is not fulfilled by any paraconsistent extension of C1, some extensions do validate certain De Morgan laws, which are upheld in classical logic.

A diagram illustrating diverse methods for expanding C1 into other paraconsistent logics is presented. Also discussed is the pursuit of identifying new paraconsistent logics, as well as the challenge of determining which logic is maximally paraconsistent. The authors consider investigating different paraconsistent logics and tackling the issue of maximality as part of their future research endeavors.
