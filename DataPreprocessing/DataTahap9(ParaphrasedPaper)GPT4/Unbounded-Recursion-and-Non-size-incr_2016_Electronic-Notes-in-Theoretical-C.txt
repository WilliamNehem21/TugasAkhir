Type systems designed to characterize polynomial-time functions that don't increase in size have undergone thorough examination. These systems serve as an alternative to predicative recursion, strictly avoiding not just recursive definitions that lead to exponential growth but also standard algorithms for computing functions that maintain or reduce the size of their inputs.

In these systems, the inclusion of type classes is asymmetrical since some subrecursive classes such as sbs0 and sbs1 do not encompass regressive functions. Leveraging the method for regressive machines as outlined in a referenced paper, it's demonstrable that the class of regressive functions R and the class of functions characterized by the system S are equivalent when it comes to polynomial time. However, applying the same method to compare the classes of regressive (R) and system-characterized (S) functions specifically for sbs0 and sbs1 seems infeasible.

Future research could explore these issues further, possibly seeking out function algebras that can represent the regressive and non-size-increasing functions within commonly recognized complexity classes.
