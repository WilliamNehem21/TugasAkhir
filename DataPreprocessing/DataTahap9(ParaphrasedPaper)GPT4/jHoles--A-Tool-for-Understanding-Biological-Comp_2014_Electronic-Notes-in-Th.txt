Weighted complex networks are increasingly utilized for analyzing the relationships and intensity of connections within groups of nodes in complex systems. Topological Data Analysis (TDA), a branch of computational topology, uses topological methods to conduct robust analyses of scientific data and is particularly focused on studying shapes and classifying objects.

TDA has shown valuable applications in biological systems. Nicolau et al. developed a method using topological techniques to extract information from high-throughput microarray data that reveals qualitative insights into biological processes, such as identifying subgroups in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancers based on gene expression. Similarly, Chan et al. have employed topological methods to enhance our understanding of viral evolution beyond traditional phylogenetic tree approaches.

Despite TDA's strengths in analyzing weighted networks, computational challenges remain. Empirical studies indicate that the majority of processing time for analyzing networks through TDA involves loading the graph and the filtration process, with a minor portion devoted to computing persistent homology. The bottleneck often lies in identifying cliques, which are complete subgraphs where each node is connected to all others. Since finding cliques is an NP-complete problem, repeated computation of maximal cliques (which include all smaller cliques) at each step can be time-consuming and resource-intensive, particularly for large networks or those with numerous different edge weights.

To address computational inefficiencies, an alternative method proposes using the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm to find all maximal cliques just once for the entire graph and subsequently identify the remaining cliques by evaluating these maximal cliques.

The latest version of the software JHoles provides users with the ability to calculate key network statistics fundamental to network analysis, such as size, volume, average degree, maximum degree, clustering coefficients, negativity, and network weight, aiding in tasks like comparison, classification, and anomaly detection.

The paper also addresses practical applications of TDA, describing the analysis of a transportation network based on data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics from the year 2000, where flights between airports are aggregated by city routes and weighted by yearly passenger traffic. Additionally, a gene interaction network, built from a sample of the full human genome dataset, demonstrates TDA's applicability to biological data.

Benchmark results, including processing times for the datasets by JHoles and the original Holes software with a cutoff at 25 minutes if incomplete, are provided to evaluate performance improvements.

To ensure accessibility, the paper includes a section with mathematical definitions related to graph theory, algebraic, and computational topology, recommending additional comprehensive references for those interested in a more thorough examination of these subjects.
