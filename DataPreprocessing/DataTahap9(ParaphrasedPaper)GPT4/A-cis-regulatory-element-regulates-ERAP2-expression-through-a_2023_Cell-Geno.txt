Variations in the ERAP2 gene are linked to autoimmune diseases and severe infections, yet their role in these conditions is unclear. A study by Venema et al. utilizes genome editing and functional genomics methods to demonstrate that these variants affect ERAP2 gene activity through various independent pathways, including converting a gene promoter downstream of ERAP2 into an enhancer specific to the ERAP2 gene.

The team conducted experiments to determine the importance of a specific genetic variation (rs2248374) on ERAP2 expression. Using CRISPR technology, they employed a sophisticated technique called homology-directed repair (HDR) to switch the G allele of rs2248374 to the A allele in certain cell lines and then assessed the outcomes. The introduction of a silent restriction site allowed for the identification of successfully edited cells.

By replacing the allele of another variant (rs2548224), they investigated its influence on the expression of ERAP2 and related genes. Their findings showed significant changes in expression, suggesting that this variant plays an important role in gene regulation.

Importantly, the intricate association (linkage disequilibrium) among variants around the ERAP2 gene implies that the effects of rs2248374 on gene splicing and other regulatory mechanisms, like the positioning of chromosomes within the cell nucleus, tend to be interconnected. Despite this, each variant's independent contribution to the overall expression of ERAP2 necessitates functional differentiation due to its relevance for understanding diseases linked to this gene.

The study delves into the mechanics behind higher ERAP2 levels found in autoimmune conditions. The implications are significant; the gene might not be contributing to illness due to its mere presence but because it is expressed at heightened levelsâ€”something influenced by pro-inflammatory and regulatory cytokines.

This research also involved lab work to explore genomic alterations, using SNP-array for copy number profiling and regions of homozygosity analysis, which contribute to understanding genomic stability in edited cell cultures.

Overall, Venema et al. offer new insights into the genetic regulation of ERAP2 that might eventually lead to improved treatments for autoimmune diseases and infections linked to these genetic variants.
