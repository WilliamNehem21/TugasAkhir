Here is a paraphrased version of the academic paper excerpts:

The structure of this paper is outlined as follows: An introductory overview of interaction nets is provided in the subsequent section. In Section 3, we illustrate the significance of our research with an example. The enhancements we suggest are detailed in Section 4, with the corresponding compilation methodologies presented in Section 5. Section 6 is dedicated to a discourse on various practical aspects of our implementation. We wrap up the discussion in Section 7.

Our paper introduces a new framework called INP that enhances the traditional interaction net system (ORN) by enabling rewrites among nested agents. The primary distinction between INP and ORN lies in INP's capacity to have interaction rules with more than two agents on their left-hand side. Despite this difference, the definitions for agents and nets continue to follow the traditional ORN guidelines.

We examine practical considerations for implementing our proposed framework, INP. There are two potential approaches: one involves converting INP into existing ORN rules to utilize current interaction net evaluators, and the other entails a direct implementation of INP. We focus on the latter, demonstrating that INP can be implemented straightforwardly. A simple method of direct implementation is discussed to facilitate computational processes within this framework.

BÃ©chet introduced the concept of computation for nets via interaction rules that function as shorthand notations, where whole nets are encapsulated as an agent with rules depicting the net's computation. To demonstrate how this approach applies to nested pattern matching, we explore the example function lastelt. One could define the lastelt agent using other pre-existing agents, but finding an effective agent combination is challenging. Alternatively, we propose using shorthand notations for list structures.

We demonstrate a way to enhance interaction nets to support nested pattern matching while avoiding the need for supplementary rules. This development offers a more straightforward and natural approach for writing interaction net programs and positions interaction nets closer to becoming a viable practical programming language.
