In the realm of software engineering, a service is a self-contained software unit that operates on one or more servers, delivering specific functions to client applications, which may also be service-based systems requiring these functions to achieve their objectives. These services interact within a system, such as exchanging information or cooperating on tasks. This interaction, however, is complex due to the limited understanding of each service's capabilities.

Building a connector that facilitates a particular behavioral protocol between services is far from straightforward. Several tools exist to assist in identifying potential flaws in connector designs, including animation engines that visualize connectors dynamically. For more intricate connectors, formal verification is attainable using tools like simulation and model checking in the Extensible Coordination Tools (ECT) framework, which supports the design and analysis of Reo models. Prior research established a mapping from timed Reo to the process algebra mCRL2, with features to model time constraints, but currently, mCRL2's verification capabilities regarding time properties are limited, lacking a real-time model checker, time-aware simulation, and a property specification language with time support.

This paper addresses the shortfall by integrating ECT with UPPAAL, a robust toolset for modeling, validating, and verifying real-time systems. UPPAAL utilizes networks of communicating timed automata, where a systematic approach to modeling concurrent and distributed system behavior can reveal design errors. UPPAAL automata synchronize through channels and may include local, global, or parameterized variables.

The paper is structured into six sections: introducing Reo (section 2), detailing UPPAAL's automata (section 3), explaining how Reo channels are modeled with UPPAAL (section 4), demonstrating UPPAAL's analysis on a Reo workflow model (section 5), and concluding with outlining future work (section 6). In UPPAAL, some special channel types are necessary to replicate the behavior of Reo's constructs, such as Replicator nodes, which use broadcast channels for multi-party communication.

In conclusion, the paper presents a way to map Reo to timed automata for analysis by the UPPAAL model checker. Although Reo and UPPAAL have conceptual differences, the behaviors of Reo dataflow models can be preserved through this mapping. This method contrasts with other approaches, such as SAT-based verification or compositional models that merge synchronous and asynchronous communications. Future research aims to formally define the relationship between Timed Constraint Automata (TCA) and the UPPAAL-timed automata network semantics. Previous studies have explored constraint automata to timed automata translations but under different assumptions, such as non-distributed Reo connectors or zero-time coordination, treating communication delay as an independent factor.
