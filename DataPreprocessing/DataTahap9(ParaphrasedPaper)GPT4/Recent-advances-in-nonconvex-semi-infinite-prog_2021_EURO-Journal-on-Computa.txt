This review paper synthesizes the progress made in the field of semi-infinite programming (SIPs) over the past two decades. It provides a comprehensive look at the various solution methods and algorithms for SIPs, particularly emphasizing deterministic approaches that do not assume convexity. Special attention is given to situations where the constraint functions are non-concave with respect to parameters, discussing the pros and cons of different algorithms, and shining light on recent applications of SIPs.

In this context, the review touches on mathematical programs with complementarity constraints (MPCCs), highlighting the possibility of recasting SIPs with certain assumptions as MPCCs. It critiques approaches for solving SIPs through joint upper and lower-level KKT conditions and homotopy methods, noting the challenges associated with nonconvex lower-level problems.

The review is organized into four sections. Section 2 surveys algorithmic strategies for nonconvex semi-infinite optimization. Section 3 demonstrates how these methods are applicable to contemporary SIP applications. The review concludes with Section 4, which offers final thoughts on the subject matter.

While the review acknowledges linear and convex SIPs, its main focus is the emerging strategies for general SIPs rather than their special cases. It evaluates recent advancements like the oracle approach and its applications to various SIP generalizations, including stochastic methods and convergence considerations.

In an exploration of new algorithms, the paper describes a branch-and-bound technique developed by Marendet et al. for SIPs with boxed constraints at the lower level, which amalgamates interval-based global optimization with semi-infinite constraints management. The paper also suggests that these SIP methods have implications for bilevel programming without convexity assumptions and discusses examples of such applications.

An area of application in chemical engineering is parameter estimation within mixture thermodynamics, specifically excess Gibbs free energy models, and the paper details a few approaches to handling the relevant SIPs in this context.

The paper calls for a more systematic framework for benchmark problems and algorithm comparisons, as well as a broader range of SIP solvers, both open-source and commercial. It also notes the infancy of theory and methodology development for SIPs that involve nonsmooth or mixed-integer variables, suggesting this as a direction for future research given the difficulty of global subproblem solutions in such cases.
