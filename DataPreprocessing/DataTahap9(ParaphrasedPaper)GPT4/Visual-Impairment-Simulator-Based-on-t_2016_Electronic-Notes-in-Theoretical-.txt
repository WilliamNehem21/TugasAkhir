The academic paper discusses how individuals with normal vision often overlook the struggles faced by those who are blind or visually impaired because they take their sight for granted. Many daily tasks that are considered simple for the sighted can be significant obstacles for people with visual impairments. The paper suggests that exposing sighted individuals to the experience of visual disabilities could lead to greater empathy and understanding.

A study was conducted with five sighted undergraduate volunteers (three men and two women) from Panamericana University. Aged 19 to 24 with an average age of 21.2, these participants had good vision and did not require glasses, which was important to avoid interference with the virtual reality (VR) headset used in the experiment. The experiment involved reading aloud a text of 180 words under normal conditions and while simulating various visual impairments such as diabetic retinopathy, hemianopsia, central scotoma, and tunnel vision, using different texts to avoid memorization effects.

The system developed for this simulation includes a video camera, a computer, and a VR headset. It uses real-time image processing to project altered video through the headset, mimicking various common visual impairments using the Hadamard product and a set of masks.

The volunteers' reading times were recorded to assess the impact of these visual impairments on the reading task. The results confirmed that reading speed is affected by peripheral vision.

The paper outlines two primary goals for this VR simulation system. Firstly, to provide education and awareness for normally sighted people about the daily challenges faced by those with low vision. This is aimed at professionals in fields such as special education, psychology, and vision rehabilitation. Secondly, to establish a wearable technology platform that can simulate low vision for the sighted, which could prove useful in designing and evaluating new assistive technologies.
