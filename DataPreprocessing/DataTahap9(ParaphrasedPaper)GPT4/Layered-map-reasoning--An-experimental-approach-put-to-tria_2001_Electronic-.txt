The original text emphasizes the importance of advancing the field of set theory in the realm of automated reasoning. This includes identifying decidable portions of set theory, developing general inference rules, discovering effective proof strategies grounded in domain knowledge, and more. As this specialized domain of automated reasoning evolves, numerous experiments with set theory have been conducted using standard theorem-proving systems. These experiments still challenge state-of-the-art provers or require significant user input, making them ideal benchmarks. To advance the field, it is crucial to evaluate the capabilities of general proof methods and to identify specific challenges within set theory.

The reported experiments were entirely dependent on Otter's autonomous mode, using default settings to maintain independence from any particular theorem-proving system. The chosen approach was suitable due to the relatively low syntactic complexity of the theorems under consideration.

The paper also discusses extensions to the signature, including laws on map inclusion and left-absoluteness, as a precursor to studying map totality and functionality. These concepts are significant for subsequent proofs of set-theoretical propositions.

The proofs of some laws are facilitated by pre-provided lemmas; hence, the decision was made to categorize the laws related to map constructs into several groups.

Finally, the goal is to prove a general law related to the totality of expressions like "total(f(r))", which will be instrumental in defining various set constructs. The paper starts this process by introducing two helpful lemmas.

Paraphrased version:

Given its widespread application in the sciences, it is critical to continuously seek and identify decidable parts of set theory, as well as to establish general rules for deduction, and to formulate effective proof strategies informed by its intrinsic knowledge. While experts in automated reasoning make headway and achieve independent results, trials involving set theories executed with standard theorem-provers remain challenging, making them excellent benchmarks. These trials prove valuable even for researchers creating tailored approaches for the complex field of set theories, to evaluate the effectiveness of non-specialist proof methods and to pinpoint the specific challenges within set theory.

The experimental work described relied solely on the autonomous capabilities of the theorem-proving software Otter, without any adjustment to default configurations. This method allowed for an approach less dependent on the quirks of the software, especially since the theorems in question were not overly complex syntactically.

Subsequent sections of the text address laws related to map inclusion and left-absoluteness, setting the stage for deeper investigation into maps' totality and functionality, which are pivotal for validating set-theoretical claims later discussed.

The paper notes that some laws are more easily proven with the addition of supplementary lemmas, which justifies organizing laws pertaining to map constructs into distinct groups for clearer analysis.

The next objective is to prove a general law about the totality of expressions formatted as "total(f(r))". This law is a key step towards defining a range of set constructs, and the discussion begins with an introduction of two beneficial lemmas.
