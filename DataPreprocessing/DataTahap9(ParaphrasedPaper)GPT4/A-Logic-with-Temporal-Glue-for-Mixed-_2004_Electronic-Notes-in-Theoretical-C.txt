The academic paper discusses the importance of separating various aspects in software engineering both for programming and design. Many mixed specification languages have common features, but additional study is needed for certain theoretical frameworks, like symbolic transition systems. The paper proposes a logic with a temporal mechanism for abstractly defining semantics for mixed specification languages, which allows for high-level reasoning without being tied to a specific model or language. A common refinement theory for these languages is also presented.

The paper separates system specification approaches into homogeneous (single formalism) and heterogeneous (multiple formalisms). The authors favor the heterogeneous approach as it better suits mixed specifications by allowing the most appropriate formalism for each aspect.

Semantic concerns center on symbolic representation to circumvent the state explosion problem, which is significant in systems with value-passing events or components with infinite state spaces. Symbolic transition graphs and symbolic bisimulation have been developed to address this in value-passing process algebras.

The paper presents its logic for mixed languages with powerful gluing options and offers a refinement theory. It covers theoretical aspects, with applications and examples found in further documentation on the specification language Korrigan. The logic allows reasoning about dynamic properties and provides denotational semantics. Properties of composite specifications are expressed through projected formulas, enabling constraints on model sets for composed mixed signatures.

The logic is established as an institution, providing a framework for a refinement theory and ensuring standard results on refinements apply to composed mixed specifications.

Future work will explore symbolic bisimulation and symbolic temporal logics to see if they can be generalized to a broader class of mixed languages. Work on categorizing aspect notions and combination operators is also planned, as commonalities between static and dynamic aspects within the logic suggest potential research avenues.
