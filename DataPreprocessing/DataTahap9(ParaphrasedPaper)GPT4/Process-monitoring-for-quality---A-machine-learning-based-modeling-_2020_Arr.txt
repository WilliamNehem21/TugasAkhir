Process monitoring for quality utilizes a big data methodology to identify defects in manufacturing using binary classification and data analysis. At its core are "big models," frameworks that employ machine learning, statistical analysis, and optimization to handle process data and develop a functional model reflective of manufacturing operations. These functional models are designed to be both efficient (parsimonious) and effective, earning the trust of engineers to oversee production processes reliably.

The article suggests a modeling technique specifically for detecting rare quality events. This method encourages parsimony through careful feature and model selection. Its effectiveness in handling unbalanced data and its compatibility with various machine learning algorithms like SVM, logistic regression, naive Bayes, and k-nearest neighbors is demonstrated in four different case studies. Experimentally, this new learning scheme surpasses traditional approaches, like the L1-regularized logistic regression and random undersampling boosting, in terms of both simplicity and predictive performance.

Previous scholarly works have addressed this issue by proposing frameworks and fault detection/removal methodologies, with an extensive review of significant literature in the field. Some current practices, like over/under-sampling and cost-sensitive learning, are criticized for lacking theoretical grounding and fail to generalize efficiently. The paper encourages further research in developing algorithms that can learn directly from highly unbalanced data without any ad hoc manipulation.

The proposed method merges two feature selection techniques—the hybrid correlation and ranking-based (HCR) and the ReliefF algorithms—to identify important features. To enhance parsimony, a collection of potential models is considered, and then a penalized maximum probability of correct decision (PMPDC) criterion is used to choose the best model. This selection principle is applicable to any machine learning algorithm where complexity is tied to feature count.

The paper is structured to first review the theoretical background, then describe the PMQ-L framework, followed by empirical binary classification studies and a comparative analysis. It concludes by summarizing the research.

Preprocessing methods, or filters, eliminate irrelevant features independently from the learning algorithm by using various metrics to score feature relevance. Hybrid approaches that combine these filters with other methods aim to solve scalability issues and optimize learning outcomes. The process involves ranking features, performing correlation-based feature elimination, and optimizing prediction performance.

Only classifiers that primarily rely on the number of features for complexity, such as SVM, LR, NB, KNN, and FLD, are compatible with the proposed learning scheme. Therefore, algorithms like neural networks and random forests are not considered.

The study analyzes four highly unevenly distributed datasets using the mentioned algorithms, showcasing the approach's effectiveness in identifying key system features, even with limited data and complex learning tasks. The authors conclude that while the PMQ-L method may not guarantee the best possible solution, it effectively identifies high-quality solutions promptly and can deal with various learning algorithms and unbalanced data structures.
