In this paper, the authors discuss the process of generalization from specific examples to a broader framework in the context of modal logic. They extend the basic modal system to what they refer to as the polymodal neighbourhood logic (PNL) and illustrate that this more general system can encompass multiple existing systems as particular cases.

The authors emphasize that by considering a set of individuals and defining certain families of subsets within that set, they establish the foundation for PNL and demonstrate how it can reconstruct results from previous work in a straightforward manner. They point out that their primary contributions to the field are conceptual, noting that PNL naturally incorporates multi-modal and poly-modal scenarios, which indicates the inherent suitability of this approach for unifying diverse logical systems.

Moreover, the paper showcases an example with a sentence that was originally formalized using a unary modal operator and later revisited using a binary modal operator. This demonstrates the flexibility of the PNL framework.

The authors mention that modal logic systems with neighbourhood semantics, which their work generalizes, are simply extensions of the basic modal logic. The paper serves as an introduction to these systems, offering a complete account for the fundamental polymodal neighbourhood system and elucidates how various influential systems that rely on neighbourhood-like semantics can be represented within their generalized framework.

Lastly, the authors acknowledge that while they have laid the groundwork for studying polymodal neighbourhood languages, there remains substantial work to be explored and developed in this area.
