The flow characteristics of the top dross layer in a tundish play a crucial role in determining the oxidation of molten steel, as well as the removal and entrainment of inclusions which can cause surface defects in steel products. This study employs the Volume of Fluid (VOF) method to simulate the charging and continuous casting processes in two different tundish structural designs. The findings reveal that flow control measures have a considerable impact on the stability of the dross layer and the likelihood of dross entrainment. An improved tundish design results in a more stable dross layer and a reduced risk of entrainment, which is beneficial for eliminating inclusions and enhancing the cleanliness of molten steel.

Recent findings show that defects found on steel sheets often have the same composition as the protective dross used in tundishes, indicating that dross entrainment during casting is a significant cause of these imperfections in ultra-low carbon steel. Therefore, understanding the flow behavior of the molten steel and protective dross is essential to advance the purity of steel and optimize the inclusion removal process.

Several researchers have explored various aspects of tundish behavior using numerical simulations. In this particular study, the VOF method was used to simulate the dynamics of the top dross layer and molten steel flow during the charging and continuous casting processes, considering two different tundish designs. The aim was to examine the distribution and flow state at the interface between the molten steel and the dross, which can inform tundish construction for high purity steel production.

The VOF method, developed by Hirt & Nichols, is a grid-based approach that tracks the volume fraction of immiscible fluids within computational cells, assuming the dross layer is always in a flow state and neglecting its cooling and solidification.

For the simulations, the tundish was modeled in Fluent software, using Gambit for the design and meshing at a 1:1 scale. With specific dimensions and conditions set for the teeming and submerged nozzles, the simulations were performed on half of the tundish model to save computational resources. The wall boundary was treated as no-slip, using standard wall functions, with velocities determined by casting speed and slab dimensions.

The simulation results indicated that in the first model, which is common in two-strand slab continuous casting tundishes, the flow control designs such as retaining walls and dams create turbulence that can disrupt the dross layer and hinder the absorption of inclusions. In the improved model, the flow was altered to generate a horizontal rotational motion that aligns with the separation principles of mechanics, enhancing the stability of the dross layer and facilitating the absorption of inclusions without disruption. This new model design is particularly effective for the production of high purity steel.
