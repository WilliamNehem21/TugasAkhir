The study by Lei Zhang et al. focused on examining the depth of the hardness layer formed on alloy steel during grinding. Concurrently, Fu X.L. and team researched the surface hardening of aluminum alloys when subject to high-speed milling. Against this background, the turning of stainless steel, specifically JIS SUS 303, gained attention. It was essential to understand the various factors that could influence the quality of turning results. The research aimed to investigate how these factors impacted the roundness and hardness of the turned stainless steel.

The experiments were conducted with two sets of trials, wherein the roundness was gauged using an average value method, and hardness was evaluated using the Rockwell Scale B. Measurements were taken at three different points on the machined surface. Statistical analysis was then utilized to determine the effect of various factors on roundness and hardness.

Before conducting the experiments, initial levels for each experimental factor were established. These were later verified with a normality test, which confirmed the experimental conditions were appropriately chosen, as the results were significantly normal. The primary focus of the investigation was to determine the main factors and their interactions that influenced both roundness and hardness of the turned material.

The findings of the study indicated that cooling significantly affected the roundness during turning, with non-cooled, or dry-cutting, leading to lower quality in roundness, suggesting that cooling improves roundness quality. However, hardness of the turned stainless steel SUS 303 surface did not show any significant alterations due to variations in cutting speed, feed rate, or the presence or absence of cooling; the hardness of the stainless steel was consistent before and after machining.
