The academic paper discusses the relationship between grammar and programming language semantics, with a focus on compiler grammar development. Specifically, it addresses the complexities of defining grammars for language parsing. A grammar serves both syntactic and semantic definition purposes, but the grammar facilitating semantic definition might not typically be LR(1), which is optimal for parser generation. This was exemplified during the development of the Java standard. The original Java language specification had to adjust its grammar for semantics to make it suitable for compiler generation, shifting to LALR(1). By the third edition, the grammar for the compiler was expressed using EBNF and included ambiguities.

Additionally, the paper outlines an algorithm for converting a recognizer into a parser, acknowledging that this approach may lead to both spurious and correct derivations. It notes that while the discussed recognizer isn't suited for grammars with hidden left recursion, the related RIGLR algorithm is more versatile, with cubic worst-case complexity. A parser variant can build Shared Packed Parse Forests (SPPFs), but since these are Tomita-style, the parser's complexity is unbounded polynomial.

For constructing a binarized SPPF, additional nodes are needed for rules longer than two symbols, leading to a more complex final algorithm. In a binarized SPPF, each non-packed node can have O(n) packed node children, with a total of O(n^3) packed nodes. Since non-packed nodes can create O(n) edges and packed nodes can create two edges, binarized SPPFs may contain up to O(n^3) edges.
