We utilize the diffusion approximation method to analyze a classical queueing system categorized as G/G/N/N, referencing Erlang's established Markovian and steady-state formulations. The diffusion approximation enables consideration of generalized interarrival and service times, and provides solutions for the model in both steady-state and transient conditions. This technique is subsequently utilized to simulate a sliding window protocol and assess the performance of a call center.

The study extends the method to account for diffusion processes with piecewise-constant parameters, varying based on the diffusion's value. The key innovation is the introduction of hypothetical barriers that delineate subintervals of the process where diffusion parameters are uniform. Previous research applied this concept to model probability flows affected by diffusion jumps, as seen in sending optical packets of variable sizes within an electronic-optical node and representing spatially irregular failures in sensor network transmissions. Within the context of the G/G/N/N model, these barriers create unit subintervals corresponding to the number of occupied service channelsâ€”the interval (0, 1] indicates one busy channel, the interval (1, 2] signals two busy channels, and so on. For the extended G/G/N/N+M model, the final interval's length corresponds to M+1 units, accounting for an expanded capacity in the system.
