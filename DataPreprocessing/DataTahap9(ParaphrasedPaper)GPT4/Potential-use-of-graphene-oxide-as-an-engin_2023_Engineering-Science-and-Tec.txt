After investigating the impact of graphene oxide (GO) nanosheet additives on engine oil, researchers found a reduction in motored torque, which is indicative of diminished engine friction, by as much as 6%, and an increase in mechanical efficiency by up to 2.8% at specific engine revolutions. Furthermore, on average, the introduction of GO nanosheets into the oil correlated with a 2.6% enhancement in brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC) and a 2.7% increase in brake thermal efficiency (BTE) across various engine speeds. These promising outcomes suggest that GO nanosheets can potentially improve the performance and efficiency of internal combustion engines, which could result in notable energy and fuel conservation and a consequential decline in CO2 emissions.

As engine technologies evolve with the introduction of features like super or turbocharging and start-stop systems, there is a growing demand for engine oils that can withstand higher pressures and temperatures. Typically, such additives face environmental scrutiny due to potential toxicity in exhaust emissions. Accordingly, nanoparticles have emerged as candidates for inclusion in lubricants given their exceptional thermal properties and small size, which help reduce friction and wear. Various types of nanoparticles have been studied, including metals, metal oxides, carbon-based materials, and boron-based compounds.

Most research on nanoparticle additives has highlighted their ability to improve friction and wear attributes of base oils. The friction reduction and anti-wear mechanisms of nanoparticles could include several operations, such as sliding between layers, tribofilm deposition, and self-repairing effects. Nevertheless, these investigations have been primarily limited to test benches, with few examining the impact on actual internal combustion engines under realistic conditions.

The study, thus, focused on exploring the use of GO nanosheets as an additive in synthetic SAE 10W-40 oil at varying concentrations. The results indicated that the nanoparticles effectively decrease coefficient of friction (COF) in all lubrication regimes, consequently providing improved wear resistance. The findings show that the optimal concentration for the balanced tribological performance was 1.5 mg/ml. Overall, GO nanosheets have proven to be a promising multi-functional additive, potentially leading to better engine mechanical efficiency and fuel savings, ultimately aiding in the reduction of CO2 emissions. However, further extensive studies are required to thoroughly understand the long-term impacts of GO nanosheets on engine durability, warm-up phases, and the longevity of commercial engine oils.
