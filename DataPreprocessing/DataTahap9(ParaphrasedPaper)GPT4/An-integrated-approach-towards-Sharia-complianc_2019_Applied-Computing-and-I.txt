The rapid growth in e-commerce adoption is driven by its benefits for traditional businesses expanding online and internet-born companies. Despite this growth, consumer trust issues persist as a significant barrier to e-commerce's broader acceptance. Addressing these concerns from an Islamic standpoint, in accordance with Sharia law, has garnered increased focus within the scholarly domain, aiming to instill confidence among the global Muslim population of over 1.8 billion.

In Islamic e-commerce transactions, the offer is viewed as the initial proposal from either party, and acceptance is the other party's agreement to the offer's terms. While traditionally conducted verbally, Islamic scholars also recognize electronic methods as valid for contracts. The transaction process must be transparent and consistent. In an Islamic context, Riba, the practice of lending money with interest, is strictly prohibited and thus using any form of interest-bearing payment, such as Riba credit cards, is unacceptable in both physical and online transactions.

To boost e-commerce trust, there's advocacy for third-party assurances that can validate an e-commerce vendor's adherence to Sharia principles. This endorses the vendor's reliability by validating Sharia compliance, privacy, security, and overall trust in an e-commerce context.

The trust in e-commerce systems is predicated on the integrity, competence, benevolence, and quality of a vendor's website. McKnight and colleagues have established these factors as critical in influencing e-commerce trust. Trust involves the trustee—the one in whom trust is placed—the expectancy of trust maintenance, and the willingness to base actions on this premise. E-commerce trust is influenced by both the consumer's religious commitment, propensity to trust, and external assurances of a site's credibility. Specifically, adherence to Sharia principles enhances trust, alongside the perceived integrity, competence, benevolence, and quality of the e-commerce website.

Benevolence, or the act of extending goodwill, is particularly noteworthy as it reflects a vendor's genuine motivation to prioritize the customer's interest. The perception of vendor benevolence therefore directly correlates to the degree of trust consumers place in them, bolstering the overall trust in Sharia-compliant e-commerce trust (SCE-C trust).
