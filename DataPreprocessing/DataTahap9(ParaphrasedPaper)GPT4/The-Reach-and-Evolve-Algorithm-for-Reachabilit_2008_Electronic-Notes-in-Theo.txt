This scholarly article introduces a sophisticated algorithm for conducting precise reachability analysis on nonlinear dynamical systems. Known as the Reach and Evolve (R&E) algorithm in the continuous time setting, the approach is founded on interval analysis principles along with detailed discretization of both space and time. Initially focused on discrete time systems, the algorithm is further adapted to deal with continuous time systems dictated by ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Promising results from initial numerical tests are shared.

The paper outlines the R&E algorithm, which operates by calculating reachability and evolution steps for dynamic systems described by arbitrarily nonlinear continuous equations. Section 2 of the paper delves into interval analysis, setting the stage for the R&E algorithm and its characteristics discussed in Section 3. The promising outcomes of experimental tests are then detailed in Section 4.

A secondary discussion highlights the use of outer rounding in numerical calculations to ensure precision, given the limitations of finite precision number representation. The paper notes how most interval libraries implement this feature to validate results, like demonstrating that the operation [1, 2]/[3, 7] might yield [0.142, 0.667] when rounded to three-decimal accuracy.

An elementary interval integrator based on a rigorous remainder-bounded first-order Taylor expansion is presented in an appendix. Although higher-order expansions are more efficient, the appendix's method is simpler to introduce and leads to intriguing results.

The discussion also acknowledges the intricate balance between the granularity of spatial discretization, essential for accurate calculations, and computational efficiency. The reachability algorithm utilizes a finite set of small boxes, which collectively represent the discretization of space, contributing to the 'universe' in which the system operates.

Modifications to the basic reachability algorithm for discrete-time systems are suggested to reduce error. This involves limiting over-approximation on a grid to every 'm' steps rather than at each step, at the cost of increasing computational resource demands. The paper anticipates a complexity roughly proportional to 'm' and acknowledges the exponential rise in computations with decreases in the grid size, particularly in higher dimensions.

The paper then compares the R&E algorithm with HSolver, a tool designed for safety analysis in nonlinear hybrid systems, illustrating how the R&E algorithm may possess advantages in efficiency for reachability analysis in ODE-driven systems.

Lastly, the article addresses the challenge of infinite time horizons in precise numerical algorithms, introducing the 'bounded reachable set' concept to manage this within the R&E algorithm. Future work will likely involve incorporating higher-order Taylor expansions for improved performance, refining algorithm parameters, and extending the R&E algorithm to address hybrid systems. The preliminary version of the algorithm has been implemented in the Ariadne software package. It is noted that, during the experiments, when the initial rough enclosures fail, the typical response is to decrease the step size, h, although this adjustment was not necessary in their tests due to an adequately small initial h chosen.
