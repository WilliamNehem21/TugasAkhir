The academic paper describes Safeguard, a system designed to improve the reliability and robustness of critical infrastructures. This system employs distributed autonomous agents to monitor and safeguard these infrastructures. One of the agents in the system integrates a workflow management system to facilitate real-time processing of information gathered from different monitoring tools such as anomaly detectors and intrusion detection systems. Workflows are represented as augmented Petri nets, which simulate generic attack or failure scenarios. Automated responses are initiated based on the results from Bayesian network analyses connected to the workflow transitions. The paper provides an example involving the management of an electricity distribution network.

The safeguard system utilizes a layered approach with agents that include hybrid detector agents, which monitor system operations and components, as well as system malfunctions, to evaluate the system's status and detect any erroneous data or attacks. These agents can communicate issues directly to operators or take measures to counteract unwanted behavior. Important agent types are discussed in detail.

Wrapper agents link Safeguard to existing intrusion detection systems, allowing the system to incorporate information from these existing tools. The data from wrapper agents is forwarded to Correlation Agents. An example of a wrapper agent is one that checks file integrity, looking for unauthorized changes to crucial system files.

The Workflow Correlation Agents (WCAs) have an embedded workflow management system and are responsible for analyzing information from various sources. They utilize predefined workflow models related to the managed network and Bayesian networks tied to these workflow transitions. These agents help in determining the network's condition and operators' actions, initiating quick, automated responses to rectify issues. For example, they might adjust firewall policies to stop the spread of a computer worm.

The BOSSA workflow management system was selected for Safeguard because it provides certain advantages over other available systems. Workflows modeled in BOSSA are based on basic elements of Petri nets, which include places, transitions, and arcs.

Bayesian networks are represented in XML and use software like JavaBayes to update the beliefs of nodes in the Bayesian networks that are linked to workflow transitions. Incoming messages from anomaly detectors are linked to propositions in Bayesian networks, which inform the likelihood of transitions firing in the associated workflows.

A case study with the emulation of the Code Red and Slammer worms helped evaluate Safeguard's effectiveness. These emulations showed that Safeguard could detect known and unknown worms and take actions to reduce their impact on the network.

The paper concludes with information on the ongoing construction and evaluation of Safeguard on critical infrastructures like electricity distribution and telecommunications. The discussion primarily focuses on the aspect of correlation, which involves synthesizing information from different types of anomaly detection and IDS and establishing patterns of attacks over time.

Lastly, the paper mentions that building various anomaly detectors that recognize deviations from normal behavior is a key part of the system, allowing it to detect new types of attacks initially. Additionally, workflows aid in confirming and responding to analyzed patterns of attack, intertwining action and information synthesis.
