To demonstrate that the satisfiability problem is NEXPTIME-hard, we will employ the technique of reduction, specifically from a NEXPTIME-complete tiling problem. To start, let us consider a natural number k and define a tile type t as a quartet of colors, represented by the notation t=(left(t), right(t), up(t), down(t)). The specific tiling problem we are addressing can be defined in the following manner.
