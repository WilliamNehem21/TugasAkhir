The paper discusses how product design effectively conveys meaning through form characteristics, which are essential in the transmission of product semantics. Users perceive products through their shapes, which creates a short-term memory that interacts with their long-term memory and experiences, leading to a personalized perception of the product. This perception can be vague and is not easily quantifiable. To address this, the paper suggests using linguistic descriptors based on fuzzy logic to translate this ambiguous perceptual intent into numerical values for quantitative analysis.

An experiment was conducted, and the results are presented in Chart 2. This chart shows initial common degree values (all starting at 1) and the common degrees after factor extraction, indicating the proportion of information captured by each factor, with all variables exceeding 0.5 and most above 0.7.

The paper explains that in the factor component matrix, high load values (>0.5) suggest a strong correlation with the original variables, helping identify which ones are best represented by the principal components. Based on this, a two-dimensional space is created with axes labeled to reflect various product attributes. One axis ranges from fine, soft, simple, and user-friendly to rough, complex, and mechanical, while the other axis spans from public, friendly, and traditional to personal, apathetic, and luxurious.

Examining the placement of products like cars on these axes, the paper notes that the Volkswagen Beetle falls on the end representing delicate and user-friendly attributes, reflecting its public recognition as a personalized vehicle. Conversely, the General Motors Cadillac CTS is associated with rough and mechanical features, indicative of its design.

The paper asserts that in China, more attention is now being paid to the visual appeal of automobile designs. However, problems persist where designers rely on intuition rather than scientific analysis of user needs, leading to potential misalignment with consumer preferences. To combat this, the paper proposes a data-driven method to capture and analyze user perceptions, forming perceptual image profiles based on car morphology, using a combination of statistics, psychology, and social science. This approach aims to contribute to more informed and systematic automobile design processes in the future.
