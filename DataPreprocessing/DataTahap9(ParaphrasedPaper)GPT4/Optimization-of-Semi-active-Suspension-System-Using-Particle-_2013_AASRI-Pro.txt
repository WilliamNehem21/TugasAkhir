This paper discusses the development and assessment of quarter car models for passive and various semi-active suspension systems, highlighting that semi-active suspensions, when optimized, can outperform passive and active systems in terms of weight and operational cost efficiency. To enhance the semi-active models, fuzzy logic controllers are integrated, adept at managing system non-linearities via heuristic rules. The study employs particle swarm optimization to refine the scaling factors of the fuzzy logic controller inputs and output, ensuring they stay within normalized ranges. The performance of this optimized system is then evaluated against counterparts that utilize different control algorithms, including the passive system, with the criteria being road handling and ride comfort. The results indicate the clear superiority of the particle swarm optimized semi-active suspension system that uses fuzzy logic.

Zadeh is recognized as a pioneer in fuzzy set theory, and his work set the groundwork for the field. Mamdani built upon Zadeh's ideas and demonstrated fuzzy logic control on a steam engine model. Since manually tuning scaling factors of fuzzy logic control systems is challenging, particle swarm optimization—a method known for its fast convergence and low computational demands—is used for this purpose, and it is beneficial for various engineering applications. 

This paper details the modeling of quarter car passive and semi-active suspension systems in Simulink, with a focus on an optimized fuzzy logic controller whose inputs and output are normalized, and gain factors are determined using an offline tuning method via particle swarm optimization. Section 2 of the paper elaborates on the modeling and optimization techniques, while Section 3 analyzes the simulation outcomes, and Section 4 concludes the findings.

The semi-active suspension model in this research requires variable damping coefficients, achieved through a fuzzy logic controller. This controller consists of essential elements like the fuzzification interface, fuzzy rule base, decision-making logic, and defuzzification interface. It takes relative displacement and relative velocity as inputs and outputs the desired damping coefficient. Using Mamdani inference with centroid defuzzification, the paper establishes a set of rules based on normalized membership functions for the inputs and outputs.

Optimization is conducted using particle swarm optimization, where each particle individually adjusts three scaling factors to discover optimal positions (best known positions are indicated as 'lbest' for individuals and 'gbest' for the swarm). Updated particle positions are determined by equation-defined velocity in iterative steps.

Simulation results reveal that the optimized fuzzy system excels at minimizing suspension displacement overshoot and stabilizing quickly, offering the best ride comfort among tested systems. Passive systems, by contrast, show no stabilization for suspension displacement. The optimized fuzzy logic system also demonstrates comparable tire displacement stabilization times with minimal overshoot against the groundhook system, a notable alternative in vehicle handling.

In summary, the paper presents a novel approach employing hybrid artificial intelligence techniques to craft a more effective semi-active suspension system, substantiated by modeling and analysis in Simulink. The refined fuzzy logic system, thanks to normalized input and output functions and particle swarm optimization, provides significant improvements over passive and other control systems in terms of road handling and ride comfort.
