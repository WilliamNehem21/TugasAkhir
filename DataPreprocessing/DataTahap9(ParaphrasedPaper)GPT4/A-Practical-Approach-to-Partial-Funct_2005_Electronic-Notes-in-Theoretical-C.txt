This paper discusses the challenge of using theorem provers that are based on classical two-valued logic to handle systems with partial functions, which are better described by logics accommodating 'undefined' values. The authors are interested in supporting partial functions without altering the theorem prover itself. They suggest adopting a method that utilizes both over- and under-approximations of formulae to work around partiality, a concept previously applied in three-valued model checking.

The core contribution of the paper is a new technique that checks the validity of a three-valued logic formula through the use of traditional two-valued logic. This approach involves creating a special type correctness condition (TCC) formula, which, when valid, ensures that the original three-valued formula is well-defined. The validity of both the TCC and the original formula can be verified using standard two-valued logic theorem provers.

The paper is structured to first provide the necessary background on the proposed three-valued logic, followed by two fundamental theorems that support the reduction of the problem to two-valued logic. It then presents empirical results showing the application of these concepts using the theorem prover CVC Lite. The conclusion summarizes the findings.

From an implementation standpoint, the method was straightforward, requiring only a few hours to code and debug. Additionally, they note that checking TCCs has a negligible impact on performance when dealing with classical examples that do not involve subtypes or partial functions, as the TCCs for these cases simplify to true. The impact on performance in larger, more complex cases involving partial functions is yet to be assessed.

In summary, the authors offer a three-valued logic based on Kleene's approach tailored to systems with partial functions. They demonstrate how validating formulas in this logic can be efficiently carried out using standard two-valued theorem provers by also checking an associated TCC, the size of which is linear relative to the original formula.
