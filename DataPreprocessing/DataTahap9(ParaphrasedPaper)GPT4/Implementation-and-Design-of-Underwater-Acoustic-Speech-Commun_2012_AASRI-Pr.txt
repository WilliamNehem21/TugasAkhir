The TMS320VC5509A features three high-speed, full-duplex, multi-channel buffered serial ports (McBSPs). Each interface can manage up to 128 channels and operate at speeds of up to 100 MB/s. The McBSPs offer a straightforward serial connection option within the TMS320VC5509A DSP or between the DSP and other system devices. They allow for seamless interfacing with other C55xx DSPs, industry-standard port codecs, and other serial devices like ADCs and DACs within the system. It's notable that different DSP McBSPs may have varying numbers and configurations of pins.

The study details the development of a low-power, half-duplex underwater acoustic communication system utilizing Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) technology. The fundamental principles and critical technologies underlying OFDM are explored. To achieve low power consumption in the hardware design, the system incorporates power-efficient operational amplifiers and A/D and D/A converters. The AMBE-2000 Speech Codec is employed to compress the original speech signal, while the TMS320VC5509A DSP is utilized to handle the modulation and demodulation of the speech signal. The practicality of this OFDM-based underwater acoustic communication system was confirmed through testing within a pool environment.
