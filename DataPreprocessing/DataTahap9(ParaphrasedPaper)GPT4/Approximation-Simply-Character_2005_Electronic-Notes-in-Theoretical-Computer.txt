Our work is grounded in the fundamental principles of domain theory, presuming that the reader possesses a foundational understanding of it. (In this context, a domain refers to a partially ordered set that is equipped with a basis as previously defined.) For a detailed conceptual framework, we refer to a principal source whose notation and terminology we consistently apply throughout our discourse.
