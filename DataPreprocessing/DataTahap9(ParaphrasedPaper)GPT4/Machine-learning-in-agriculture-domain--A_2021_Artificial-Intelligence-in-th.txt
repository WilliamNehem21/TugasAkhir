This academic paper offers a detailed exploration of the application of machine learning (ML) techniques to different stages of farming. The paper is structured into several sections:

Section 2 examines the deployment of ML during the pre-harvesting phase, describing how ML algorithms can measure crucial parameters including soil quality, seed characteristics, fertilizer use, pruning practices, genetic and environmental factors, and irrigation, to diminish losses in crop and fruit production.

Section 3 delves into the utilization of ML during the actual harvesting phase, while Section 4 addresses the application of ML in the post-harvesting stage.

Sections 5 and 6 delve into discussions and identify challenges associated with employing artificial intelligence (AI), ML, and deep learning (DL) in agriculture.

Key focus points in the pre-harvesting section include the classification of soil parameters such as phosphorus (P), potassium (K), organic carbon (OC) into low, medium, and high categories, boron (B) into a six-level scale from very low to very high, and soil pH into four classes ranging from strongly acidic to slightly acidic.

The paper references research by Liakos et al. and Sharma et al., who conducted surveys on soil management using ML for predicting soil properties. The goal of these studies is to save on fertilizer costs, reduce the need for soil experts, and enhance soil health. In contrast, Suchithra and Pai focused on pH values and soil fertility indices.

Alagumariappan et al. designed a real-time decision support system equipped with camera sensors for plant disease identification, testing three ML algorithms and finding the extreme learning machine (ELM) superior to the others. Savary et al. explored the impact of plant diseases on crop losses and the broader implications for global food security, arguing the importance of crop loss research in plant science.

Hua et al. provided an extensive survey of automated fruit harvesting systems for various fruits, highlighting the advancements in robotic harvesting systems in horticulture. Such automation enhances productivity, reduces harvesting time, and subsequently increases farmer profits. Kushtrim et al. described the development of a CNN model based on the single-shot detector (YOLO) algorithm for detecting fruits on trees, using a dataset of over 5000 real and synthetic images and achieving high accuracy in detection. Bauer et al. detailed an ML-based platform, AirSurf, engineered to estimate yield-related phenotypes from large-scale aerial imagery to enhance yield and crop marketability prior to harvest.

The study concludes that adhering to standard ML pipelines with experimental methods is necessary. It recommends researchers to create and share their datasets for the benefit of the community, facilitating testing and validation of new models. The survey of ML algorithms across agricultural stages aims to aid other researchers in the field.

The paper cites an example research by Doh et al., who examined automatic citrus fruit disease detection through phenotyping using ML, contributing to the broader topic of ML in agricultural applications as presented at the 25th International Conference on Automation & Computing.
