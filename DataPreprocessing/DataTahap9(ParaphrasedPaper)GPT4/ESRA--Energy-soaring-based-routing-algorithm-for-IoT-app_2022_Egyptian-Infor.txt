Software-defined wireless sensor networks (SD-WSNs) are expected to be pivotal in the evolution of the Internet of Things. In such networks, energy is a precious resource, which has led to the development of various energy-efficient routing strategies to prolong the network's lifespan. Despite this progress, existing algorithms often fall short when it comes to network stability and dependability, particularly in the occurrence of non-functional ('dead') nodes.

This academic paper introduces the Energy Soaring-based Routing Algorithm (ESRA) for IoT applications within SD-WSNs, emphasizing environmental monitoring applications. ESRA aims to enhance the reliability, stability, and longevity of the network by effectively selecting cluster heads that also serve to mitigate the controller placement problem. The algorithm treats the selection of cluster heads as a problem with NP-hard characteristics, considering factors such as the residual energy of the heads, their distance to the data collection point (sink), and their respective network loads.

To address this complex optimization problem, the paper employs a genetic algorithm to improve various network metrics including network lifetime, data throughput, latency, and reliability even in scenarios where a certain percentage of nodes are inoperative. The simulation results suggest that ESRA outperforms three contemporary algorithms in several key performance areas: improving network lifetime and throughput by 15%, 20%, and 25%; achieving energy savings of 10%, 20%, and 25%; and reducing network delay by 10%, 15%, and 20%.

For comparative analysis, the study benchmarks ESRA against recent energy-aware models found in existing literature, such as: the Energy-Efficient Fault-Tolerant Clustering Algorithm (EEFCA), Gateway Clustering Energy-Efficient Centroid (GCEEC) for wireless sensor networks in agriculture precision, and the Yellow Saddle Goatfish Algorithm (YSGA)-based energy-efficient clustering routing protocol.

The study also critiques previous solutions to the controller placement problem (CPP) by Killi and Rao, Qureshi et al., Luo et al., and Cui et al., examining their respective strategies for handling dead nodes and energy conservation in large-scale networks. The paper identifies strengths and weaknesses in these prior approaches, such as the inadequacy of heuristics like simulated annealing for node failure detection and the need for better load balancing techniques when a controller node is overwhelmed.

In conclusion, ESRA demonstrates superiority over YSGA, GCEEC, and EEFCA by effectively managing the distribution of loads, particularly in cases when there are dead nodes, and positively impacts the overall network throughput. The paper argues that by not considering the load distribution of dead nodes, the other algorithms experience a rapid decrease in the percentage of packets received as the number of dead nodes increases, which is why ESRA shows significant performance improvements in comparison.

Additionally, the paper draws inspiration from the dynamic soaring technique of the albatross, as studied by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). This technique highlights an energy-efficient way of traveling extreme distances, which could be mirrored in designing wind-propelled drones and gliders for monitoring purposes.
