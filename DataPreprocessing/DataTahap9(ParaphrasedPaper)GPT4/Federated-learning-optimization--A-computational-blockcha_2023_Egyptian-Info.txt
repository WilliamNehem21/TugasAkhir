This academic paper discusses the challenges and solutions for securing and processing data in IoT platforms, with a focus on blockchain technology and federated learning as a means to enhance data security, consistency, and efficient data transmission.

The paper highlights the limitations of current IoT models, which often lack proper predefined patterns for data security and processing. The authors propose a federated learning approach to improve real-time data analysis and security, which allows for local data processing and avoids data leakage to external parties.

Key points from the paper include:

- Real-time IoT systems require secure and efficient data processing methods.
- Many existing methods fail to bridge the security gap in data transactions.
- A new model suggests using federated learning integrated with blockchain technology for secure and energy-efficient transmission of IoT data.
- The proposed system minimizes the number of computational nodes and optimizes offloading tasks to conserve energy.
- Real-time experimental verifications are used to validate the system's security.
- The proposed method uses R3 Corda, a distributed ledger technology, to maintain consistency among different blocks and ensure secure data transmission.
- Federated learning adjusts training and testing ratios to improve outcomes.
- The suggested strategy needs to manage data storage space and avoid unnecessary data blocks to optimize system performance.
- The paper concludes by suggesting that deep convolutional neural networks and collaborative functionalities may further improve system performance in future research.

The structure of the paper is as follows:

- Section 2 provides the background and related work.
- Section 3 presents the analytical system model for designing block transactions.
- Section 4 introduces the integration of federated learning and blockchain in IoT.
- Section 5 analyzes the integrated process's results.
- Section 6 concludes the paper with directions for future research.

In essence, the authors advocate for a more secure and efficient way of handling IoT data by leveraging the strengths of federated learning and blockchain technology, recognizing that improvements can still be made to further reduce losses and enhance detection accuracy.
