The performance of photovoltaic (PV) panels is highly dependent on their operating temperature, as higher temperatures generally reduce the electrical output. Recognizing the importance of accurately predicting a PV panel's operating temperature, the authors introduce a new correlation which considers not only typical weather variables but also the panel's performance relative to its maximum power point.

The research involved using an experimental setup with two different types of PV panels, one polycrystalline and one monocrystalline, to collect temperature data using thermocouples placed on the panels. Data were logged every 10 minutes. This data allowed the authors to develop a new implicit correlation based on the ratio of the panel's operating voltage to its voltage at maximum power under varying irradiance and temperature conditions.

The least squares method was employed to determine the parameters for this new correlation. When compared to other established correlations from the literature, the authors' method showed superior accuracy, as demonstrated by a lower mean absolute error when predicting operating temperatures for the panels. The paper thus concludes that the panel's operating regime is closely linked to its operating temperature and that their proposed correlation is generally very effective in predicting this critical parameter for PV system performance.
