The academic paper discusses the challenges and advancements in the field of hybrid systems (HS), which combine discrete and continuous dynamics, and have applications across various disciplines. Conventional analysis of HS often requires detailed low-level descriptions of system states, which can be cumbersome. High-level modeling approaches like fluid stochastic Petri nets have been introduced to alleviate these complexities. However, there is still a need for simpler processes to define domain-specific languages for HS to aid in analysis.

The paper introduces a stochastic HS language derived from piecewise deterministic Markov processes, and details how SimThesys—a metamodeling framework that describes and extends formalisms—can be used to translate various high-level HS description languages into this new paradigm. This approach simplifies the investigation of HS.

The authors provide a practical example by applying their technique to a model of energy consumption in a data center, demonstrating how the method can resolve such models with the help of queuing network and hybrid Petri nets.

A literature review on three decades of HS studies is mentioned, highlighting resources for both introductory and advanced understanding of the field, and mentioning software tools like Ptolemy, Hytech, UPPAAL, and PRISM, which have influenced the authors' approach.

The paper also describes the framework's preliminary work on HS, which was previously limited to modeling aging in components. The current proposal expands this capability to more general HS classes.

The core of a formalism is an element, which includes atomic primitives needed for a model, characterized by properties and behaviors—properties associate typed values to elements, and behaviors define element actions. The formalism allows interfacing with different elements to share common behaviors and enables automatic generation of multiformalism behavior. A "formalism family" concept enables different formalisms to be solved using the same solving engines and shared characteristics.

Finally, the paper suggests extending Extended Entity-Relationship Formalisms (EEFs) to support HS via a new "Hybrid Formalism Family" (HFF) that accounts for states composed of discrete and continuous parts. This new family must consider the interaction between these parts, such as how event rates depend on continuous states and how mode changes (discrete state changes) affect continuous variables.
