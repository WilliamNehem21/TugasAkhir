The academic paper is structured into six sections, focusing on directed bigraphs and their algebraic properties. Below is a paraphrased version of the provided text:

Section 2 provides a quick review of key concepts related to directed bigraphs and their more theoretical counterparts, abstract directed bigraphs. Section 3 investigates the algebraic framework underlying directed bigraphs. This exploration is extended to the context of abstract directed bigraphs in Section 4. In Section 5, directed bigraphs are practically applied to represent the fusion calculus, demonstrating their utility in modeling. The final conclusions of the study are presented in Section 6.

The paper introduces several alternative forms of the tensor product to facilitate the sharing of names between processes. This concept is comparable to the parallel product found in process calculi, denoted as p | q, where two processes, p and q, can share names. The specific mechanisms for sharing in directed bigraphs involve either inner names directed downwards or outer names directed upwards, as elaborated in the ensuing definitions.
