Here is a paraphrased version of the provided text:

Firstly, we derive the intrinsic mode function (IMF) components and high-frequency details of a panchromatic (PAN) image by employing curvelet transform (CT), which is adept at capturing directional image features. We then determine which high-frequency details from the PAN image to infuse into the multispectral (MS) image coefficients based on linear relationships. The final high-resolution MS image is reconstructed by reversing the steps of curvelet transform and applying the inverse of the Bi-dimensional Empirical Mode Decomposition (BEMD) process.

Our experimentation with satellite data from Ikonos, QuickBird, and GeoEye demonstrates the efficacy and spectral accuracy of our proposed enhancement strategy. To substantiate our results, we employed various quality metrics such as Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM), Relative Average Spectral Error (RASE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Correlation Coefficient (CC), Erreur Relative Globale Adimensionnelle de Synthèse (ERGAS), and Quality with No Reference (QNR). Our method not only improves both subjective and objective outcomes but also outperforms state-of-the-art pan-sharpening techniques when compared against them.

The primary aim of pan-sharpening is to amalgamate the spatial details from a high-resolution image, such as a PAN or Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image, into a low-resolution MS image without compromising the spectral attributes of the latter. Prior to this process, accurate image alignment is essential to avoid distortions in the resulting image, and also, the MS image should be resampled to match the spatial reference of the high-resolution image.

Colorspace-based (CS-based) pan-sharpening methods like intensity hue saturation (IHS) are popular due to their sharpening efficacy. Other CS-based methods such as Principle Component Analysis (PCA), Brovey transform, and Gram-Schmidt (GS) produce visually impressive high-resolution MS images; however, they often fall short in preserving high-quality spectral information. Although several enhancements to these methods have been suggested, they still do not fully overcome the inherent limitations of CS-based methods.

The paper's structure is outlined as follows: Section 2 gives an overview of BEMD and curvelet transform. Section 3 describes our proposed pan-sharpening method in detail. Section 4 explains the quantitative quality assessment metrics employed in the evaluation. Comparison of our results with other methods is presented in Section 5, while Section 6 concludes the paper.

We scrutinize the downfalls of other pan-sharpening methods, emphasizing the importance of how high-frequency PAN coefficients are incorporated into the low-frequency MS sub-band. Traditional methods suggest a direct insertion, but this often leads to suboptimal results. Alternative approaches that rely on the 'à trous' wavelet transform injection standard (ARSIS) adapt the coefficients based on specific algorithms that consider local correlations between PAN and MS images, yielding superior outcomes compared to straightforward insertion techniques.

In our comparisons, we demonstrate that the proposed method not only effectively maintains spectral integrity but also offers flexibility in the information injection process. While the GS method preserves colors, it inadequately transfers spatial details from the PAN image to the pan-sharpened product. Conversely, the curvelet methodology provides an enhanced spatial quality, capturing exquisite details from the PAN image, though it may alter the spectral qualities of the MS image to some degree. However, our proposed technique exhibits commendable spatial quality and color preservation, attributable to the proficient use of curvelet for spatial enhancement and the unique spatial congruence of IMFs to limit redundancies.

We validate our method by comparing it with prominent pan-sharpening techniques, including GS spectral sharpening, adaptive IHS, Brovey, PCA, and conventional curvelet methods. We selected these for comparison due to their reputations for producing excellent results, with adaptive IHS recognized for its rapid processing.

By merging detail coefficients from a high-resolution PAN image with IMF components of a low-resolution MS image, guided by a linear dependency criterion, we achieve a high-resolution MS output.

The proposed method was assessed against other methods through both synthetic and real image datasets. Our experiments on very high-resolution QuickBird, Ikonos, and GeoEye imagery have shown that our method is quantitatively and qualitatively on par with other advanced pan-sharpening techniques. However, the performance ranking may vary across datasets, with our scheme particularly excelling on the QuickBird dataset, surpassing the GS spectral sharpening method implemented in the ENVI software suite, as well as other methods like PCA, adaptive IHS, curvelet, and Brovey.
