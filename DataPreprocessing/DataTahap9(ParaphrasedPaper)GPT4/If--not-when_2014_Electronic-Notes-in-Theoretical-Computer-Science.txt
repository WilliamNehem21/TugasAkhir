The paper proposes redefining "meaning" within language as the capacity to alter states of information rather than as hinging on the veracity of a statement. Meaning should consider information dynamics over time, which necessitates a two-tier approach to temporal referencing. The first layer involves articulating changes in the world over time, while the second layer concerns the evolution of our knowledge about these changes.

States of information and their sequential arrangements are fundamentally timeless, offering a 'God's-eye' view that is detached from temporal constraints. However, English sentences are not so timeless; tenses in the language anchor the temporal fluidity of sentences to the static nature of information states. To align these two aspects, the paper explores how sentence tenses convert the time-sensitive potentiality of meaning into time-independent relationships in information states.

Information states are composed of assertions, which at any given time, can be divided into two categories: verified and unverified. Over time, as events unfold, unverified assertions may become verified, but once an assertion is verified, it cannot revert to being unverified.

Verification is an important concept and is differentiated from speculation by the existence of a causal relationship. Our understanding of the past is built upon causal chains from past events to our present knowledge. In contrast, future knowledge is speculative, drawn from historical and current insights. Verified knowledge typically implies the existence of a causal link to the event it describes; therefore, verification cannot occur before the event itself happens.

Exceptions exist, particularly when dealing with plans or predetermined events. Discussing plans involves addressing what is stipulated to happen as per the plan, which allows for 'standing outside of time' and affirming future events, according to the plan, prior to their actual occurrence. The paper illustrates this with an example, using 'a' as the assertion time and 'v' as the verification time, and demonstrates how an assertion 'p(tp)' is verified in a state 's' at time 'v' if it belongs to the set of verified assertions within 's' at 'v'. States, therefore, are depicted as divided between verified and unverified assertions at any point in time.
