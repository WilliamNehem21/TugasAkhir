The academic paper describes the advancement of software, system, and enterprise architecture as established fields within both industry and academia, focusing on how architecture models facilitate communication among stakeholders and enhance understanding of complex systems. These models allow for inference and analysis of systems, such as identifying potential interoperability issues among enterprise services.

The paper extends previous research on architecture analysis by using Bayesian statistics. This method assesses system properties like interoperability, security, and availability. With enterprise service interoperability as an example, the paper discusses how to specify joint distributions and define conditional probabilities using matrices, allowing for probabilistic inquiries within a Bayesian network.

The authors define "abstract models" as frameworks for identifying necessary information for variable analysis and "concrete models" as the specific applications of abstract models with collected data.

Services are discussed as autonomous entities responsible for specific business functions, highlighting the importance of service quality, which is influenced by the correctness and availability of a service. Service descriptions, detailing capabilities and quality, play a crucial role in determining service quality and have attributes such as understandability and correctness.

Services utilize an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) for communication and orchestrate interactions through descriptions written in languages like BPEL (Business Process Execution Language), which must be compatible for high-quality service orchestration.

The paper discusses the interoperability assessment within service clusters at various abstraction levels, measuring service quality, protocol compatibility, service bus compatibility, and service orchestration language compatibility.

Concrete model objects have multiple attributes relevant to interoperability assessment. Evidence for these attributes can be gathered from interviews, manual testing, or document analysis, with the paper providing an example involving three evidence sources.

With a large number of attributes and potential evidence, the paper highlights the cost of evidence collection and the impracticality of obtaining all evidence. The authors propose prioritizing evidence collection based on its impact on assessment results relative to collection costs. An algorithm is presented to optimize this process.

The paper concludes with a case study implemented in GENIE, which demonstrated the diagnosis algorithm's effectiveness in reducing data collection costs significantly, emphasizing its potential in lowering the costs of system quality analyses. The diagnosis tasks involve identifying causes for symptoms and strategically collecting additional data to verify the diagnosis while minimizing costs.
