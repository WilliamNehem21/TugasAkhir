This academic paper suggests that a physical-based approach can be utilized to predict short-term power output from an individual wind farm. This involves forecasting the wind speed using numerical weather prediction (NWP) data while considering factors like surface roughness, landscape, and the impact of turbine wakes on wind power production.

The paper refers to the integration of 41 wind farms into the electrical grid with a total capacity of 4187 MW as of June 2012. These wind farms are primarily located in two areas, identified as ZJK and CD regions, boasting capacities of 2935 MW and 1088 MW respectively. Moreover, 26 of these wind farms, with a combined capacity of 2652 MW, have been using a wind power forecasting system for over six months. The study validates a method for forecasting at the scale of the entire grid based on this data. Numerical weather prediction data is provided at 5-minute intervals, and wind power data, recorded every second by SCADA systems, is also processed into 5-minute intervals to align with NWP data.

The research calculates the relative growth factor (RGF) and root mean square error (RMSE) for selected representative farms using actual measured and forecasted wind power data from January to March 2011, which then helps determine the weight coefficients using a specific equation (formula (1)).

Taking into account both single farm data and grid-scale data within the same timeframe, weight coefficients were calculated. The study also fixed the maximum wind output for the entire grid at 2687 MW. The forecast for the grid scale is obtained using a different equation (formula (2)).

The experimental results highlight the reliability and efficacy of the proposed forecasting method. It is noted that predictions at the grid scale are more accurate than those for individual farms due to regional smoothing effects. The grid-scale forecasting accuracy not only satisfies project application requirements but also significantly exceeds the demands of the industry standard.
