Pointers are powerful and versatile programming constructs that enable efficient algorithm implementations, but they are notorious for being difficult to handle, making pointer-based programs challenging to write and maintain. The use of formal techniques to manage pointer manipulation can improve software quality, especially as data structures made with pointers essentially form graphs where edges represent the pointers themselves.

The paper presents a new method for redefining or "rewriting" pointer-based data structures, using what's known as the double pushout approach to graph transformation. This method specifically targets the manipulation of cyclic data structures like circular or doubly-linked lists, focusing on adding new elements and redirecting existing pointers, but it does not address record deallocation for garbage collection.

The graph rewriting systems proposed here carefully define the redirection of pointers as either local or global. A local redirection changes the target of a specific pointer based on a pattern, akin to what happens in imperative programming languages. Global redirection, on the other hand, redirects all pointers pointing at a node to a different node, a concept often found implicitly in declarative languages.

The paper distinguishes its methodology from prior research by highlighting its interest in cyclic graphs and the ability to redirect pointers, both locally and globally. The approach differs from previous works by focusing not on the implementation of declarative programming languages but rather on understanding the basic transformation rules that apply to data structures in conventional algorithms.

The remainder of the paper provides an in-depth examination of the category of graphs they're using, technical aspects required to define rewrite steps, and a more detailed look into data structure rewriting. The authors conclude with remarks in the last section and offer proofs in the appendix, assuming that the reader has some background in category theory.

In summary, the paper introduces a new class of graph rewrite systems to manipulate cyclic data structures that include pointers. It emphasizes the importance of handling pointers directly and provides a formal framework for doing so, which has implications for analyzing characteristics like confluence or termination in graph rewriting systems.
