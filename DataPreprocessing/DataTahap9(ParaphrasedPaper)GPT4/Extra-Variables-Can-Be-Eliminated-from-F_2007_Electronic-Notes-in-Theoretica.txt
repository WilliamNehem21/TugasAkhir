The paper is structured as follows: introductory concepts and preliminary discussion are provided in the subsequent section; Section 3 forms the central part of the paper where the authors detail their methodology alongside the theorems of soundness and completeness within the CRWL framework, a recognized semantic structure for functional logic programming (FLP); Section 4 then shifts to examine practical applications and shares preliminary experimental outcomes; the last section, Section 5, recaps the findings, examines limitations, and suggests areas for future exploration. More information, especially on practical aspects, is available in the appendix.

The authors introduce a technique for transforming FLPs by replacing extraneous variables with a non-deterministic constant, gennat, which spans all natural numbers, thereby simplifying programs by eliminating these variables. This approach easily integrates with existing FLP programs.

Shifting to a more applied perspective, Section 4 discusses the implementation of grounding generators and offers experimental evidence, presented informally and exemplified through the use of the programming language TOY. The insights are generally applicable to other languages like Curry.

The paper introduces a method by which iterative deepening can ensure that generators are complete even under depth-first search, ensuring that the entire data value universe of a given type is comprehensively covered by incrementally expanding complexity levels.

In essence, the paper presents a technique for removing superfluous variables from functional logic programs, which are theoretically unnecessary. Programming in FLP languages like Curry is simplified due to the permission of non-confluent programs that these languages offer.

The authors acknowledge concurrent similar research on transforming functional logic programs to eliminate extra variables. However, they note key differences, such as the absence of practical results in that concurrent work and different formal frameworks, with the other research focusing on ordinary rewriting and using explicit substitutions to address call-time choice, an approach found unsatisfactory by the authors. In contrast, this paper utilizes the CRWL framework for a simpler and more coherent proof in the context of call-time choice.
