The concepts outlined in these statements suggest that each capsule contains multiple bisimilar states representing various computations, each of which retains different unnecessary details. Similarly, for each irreducible capsule, there exist multiple bisimilar outcomes that retain superfluous information. As a result, capsules provide a more streamlined representation of the computational state.
