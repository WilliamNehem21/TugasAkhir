The paper introduces priced timed game automata, which are an extension of timed game automata with costs associated with both their locations and transitions. It has been proven that the problem of synthesizing an optimal winning strategy for a priced timed game under certain assumptions is decidable. In this study, an algorithm for determining the optimal cost and synthesizing an optimal strategy, if one exists, is presented. The implementation of this algorithm using the tool HyTech is described, along with an illustrative example.

In recent years, the application of model-checking techniques to scheduling problems has become a well-established area of research. Many static scheduling problems with timing constraints can be formulated as reachability problems on timed automata. Real-time model-checking tools such as Kronos and Uppaal have been used in various industrial and benchmark scheduling problems.

Priced extensions of timed automata have been introduced, allowing for the consideration of general performance measures. These extensions associate a cost with each location, enabling the measurement of performance and the establishment of optimality criteria for reaching a given set of states.

It is noted that a winning strategy for a priced timed game may depend on the cost value. However, the paper aims to develop cost-independent strategies, which do not rely on specific cost values.

The study presents an algorithm for extracting an optimal, state-based, realizable, and winning strategy for a given priced timed game automaton. The authors plan to extend the class of systems for which the provided algorithm terminates and investigate the synthesis of sub-optimal strategies in cases where no optimal strategy exists. Additionally, they aim to extend the work to encompass more general winning conditions, such as safety conditions, and to consider other performance criteria.
