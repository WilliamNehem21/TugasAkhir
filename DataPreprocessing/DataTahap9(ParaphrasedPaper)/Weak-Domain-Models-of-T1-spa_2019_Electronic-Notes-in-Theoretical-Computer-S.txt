A poset model of a topological space X is defined as a poset P such that its set of maximal elements, denoted as max(P), with the relative Scott topology, is homeomorphic to X. It is known that every space with a poset model must be T1. Martin demonstrated that if a space is homeomorphic to the maximal point space of a continuous dcpo, then the space is choquet complete, implying that not every T1 space has a domain model.

Furthermore, it was shown that every T1 space X has a local quasicontinuous domain model, labeled as Zh(X). One important property is that X is sober if and only if Zh(X) is sober. Thus, if X is not sober, then Zh(X) cannot be quasicontinuous, leading to the conclusion that there exists a local quasicontinuous domain which is not quasicontinuous.
