We introduced propositional hybrid logics as improvements on propositional temporal logics, allowing for the naming and re-binding of specific states. We also introduced a sound relational abstraction method for hybrid Kripke structures and a hybrid version of computation tree logic. Additionally, we proposed a definition of hybrid labelled Markov chains and discussed the syntax and semantics of probabilistic computation tree logic in a hybrid setting. Our abstraction techniques for hybrid Kripke structures should be applicable to other settings as well.
