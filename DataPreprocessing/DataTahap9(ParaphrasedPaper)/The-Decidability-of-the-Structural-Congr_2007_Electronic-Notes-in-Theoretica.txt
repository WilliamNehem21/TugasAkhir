The beta-binders process algebra, which is a new development for representing and simulating biological systems, follows the typical approach of process calculi in its reliance on structural congruence for semantic definition. The handling of structural congruence is crucial in the context of implementation. This paper presents the initial step towards implementation by providing a proof of the decidability of the congruence.
