The analysis typically does not include certain aspects, and the upcoming sections will introduce variations in the concepts of stream derivative and multiplication operator, which possess more common properties. Nonetheless, it should be noted that within stream calculus, both the stream derivative and convolution product operations, with their atypical properties, hold significant importance.

Subsequently, coinduction proves the rest. The derivation of identity(15) can be clearly inferred from (14) and the commutativity of convolution product(9). It is also possible to present a direct coinductive proof without utilizing the latter, which is intriguing in its own right, as it will also be applicable to the inverse operator in the multivariate scenario in section 15, where the product will not be commutative. Therefore, we denote the stream(0!, 1!, 2!,...) as the archetypal example of a divergent stream, given that if one were to define a function f(x)= 0!+ 1!x+ 2!x+..., it would satisfy f(0)= 0 and remain undefined elsewhere. Consequently, the aforementioned recurrence cannot be solved using generating functions (as in traditional mathematical approaches). The problem can be resolved with the aid of formal power series, although computing the solution leads to rather intricate calculations involving hypergeometric series (cf. [11, pp.346-348]).

A multivariate r-weighted stream automaton, also known as a multivariate weighted automaton, comprises a pair q=(q, o, t) composed of a set q of states, an output function o: q → r, and a transition function t: q × (q → r)a. Here, (q → r)a contains solely functions with finite support. The output function o assigns a real number o(q) in r to each state q in q, while the transition function t assigns a function t(q): (q → r)a to a state q in q, dictating the real number t(q)(x)(q') in r for any variable x, state q', and state q. This number can be interpreted as the weight (cost, multiplicity, duration, etc.) of the transition from q to q'. The following notation will be utilized.

The definition of bisimulation-up-to represents a modification of a similar concept by Milner. Various coinductive proof methods and their coalgebraic generalizations are presented in and can be easily extended to a version that permits derivatives to be bisimilar within arbitrary contexts (including product, inverse, and other operators) following the lines of. The proofs of identities (15) and (26), for instance, could be simplified if bisimulation-up-to product were used.

The current paper expands on its foundational definitions and outcomes pertaining to streams, and introduces several new operators, along with numerous new identities (including those on exponentiation and shuffle elimination). Additionally, all the applications are novel. This is evidenced by the way such automata are constructed using splitting derivatives (as illustrated in the proof of theorem 13.3) and our utilization of infinite weighted automata (as demonstrated in the example of (tan)). Some of these concepts are already outlined in, while the use of continued fractions and their application in section 17 to coinductive counting are original relative to the aforementioned work. Theorem 17.1 represents a slightly more generalized version of a classical result by Flajolet (cf. [10, theorem 1]), expressed here in terms of weighted automata and featuring a somewhat simpler coinductive proof. Weighted automata appear to offer an intriguing alternative to the existing structures.

Additionally, another approach to counting is the categorical theory of species, which presents a framework that is more encompassing than the current calculus of streams; however, there are numerous connections between the two. Exploring the potential role of coinduction in the realm of species warrants detailed investigation.
