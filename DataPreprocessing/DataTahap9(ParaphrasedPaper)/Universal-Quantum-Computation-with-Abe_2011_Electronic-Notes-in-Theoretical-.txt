The focus of our study is on the topological quantum memories for a broad category of abelian anyon models that are defined on spin lattices. We explore the limitations of these models for conducting quantum computation using only topological operations such as braiding and fusion, and we investigate the effects of additional non-topological operations, particularly spin measurements, on the computational power of these models. Our findings show that incorporating spin measurements enables universal quantum computation while still taking advantage of the topological protection offered by these models. This research offers valuable insights into the relationship between abelian and non-abelian models and sheds light on the potential computational capabilities of abelian anyons when compared to their non-abelian counterparts.

Anyons, which are quasiparticles existing in two-dimensional systems, exhibit non-local behavior that is of interest for foundational studies in quantum physics. They have been identified as potential candidates for fault-tolerant quantum computation, with non-abelian anyon models attracting significant attention due to their ability to store, protect, and manipulate quantum information effectively. Despite this, there have been proposals to achieve universal quantum computation using an abelian model, specifically the toric code, and our study extends this proposal to a wider class of abelian models, demonstrating their universality and fault-tolerance. This analysis provides fresh insights into the capabilities of abelian anyons relative to their non-abelian counterparts and highlights the experimental potential of implementing abelian anyons for quantum computation.

Furthermore, we examine the impact of holes, caused by the absence of enforced stabilizers on the vertices and plaquettes where the qudits are stored, on the logical states and the associated Hamiltonian. We show that logical operations, such as braiding and fusion, alone do not constitute a powerful gate set, and we demonstrate how additional logical operations can be achieved through spin measurements, allowing for the implementation of various single qudit gates.

Additionally, we investigate potential errors in the model, including perturbations in the Hamiltonian and thermal errors, and analyze the effect of these errors on the encoded information.

Our study also explores the possibility of utilizing our methods in non-abelian quantum double models, highlighting the potential for increased computational power through spin measurements and the creation of ancillary states.

In sum, our research provides a comprehensive analysis of the computational capabilities and fault-tolerance of abelian anyon models, and it offers valuable insights into their potential for universal quantum computation. Moreover, we highlight the experimental relevance of our findings and their alignment with current proposals and experiments, particularly in the context of Josephson-junctions and polar molecules as potential platforms for implementing these models. Further details and elaborations on these points can be found in subsequent works by the authors.
