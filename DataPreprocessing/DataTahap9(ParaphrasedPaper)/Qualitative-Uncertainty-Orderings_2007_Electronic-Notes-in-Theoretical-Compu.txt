The difficulty of fully expressing an evaluation in the context of qualitative models, and potentially in the numerical case as well, stems from the uncertainty regarding whether a set of preferences articulated by a person forms a complete order of the discernment domain. There are several reasons why the subject may not be able or willing to provide such comprehensive information, such as challenges in comparing every conceivable event in complex contexts, or a focus on reasoning about only a restricted portion of the domain. To address this issue in qualitative frameworks, an approach similar to de Finetti's pioneering method for probability measures can be employed, involving the introduction of partial models, which are qualitative assessments defined only for some situations and intended to be restrictions of a complete model. This approach enables the analyst to concentrate the evaluation on the relevant situations for the problem at hand, while also allowing for the possibility of expanding the model to accommodate additional scenarios in the future. The subsequent section formally introduces these concepts and presents an axiomatic perspective on the most studied uncertainty orders.

Further distinctions among uncertainty notions can be made by considering the specific manner in which distinct pieces of information are combined, leading to a taxonomy of numerical measures within the numerical context, based on different approaches such as additivity for probabilities. Qualitative preference orders can be introduced based on their alignment with numerical models, resulting in a representability result that establishes the correspondence between a qualitative uncertainty notion and a numerical measure.

Similar properties can be articulated for other preference orders. Proposition 2.7 establishes the connection between qualitative notions and corresponding quantitative measures. For each uncertainty notion, the proof follows a similar approach to Proposition 2.6 but utilizes different characterizations of total preference orders instead of condition (b).

The task of qualitative framework detection becomes a classification problem: given a (partial) assessment (domain of discernment, constraints, and preferences), the objective is to determine the most stringent among all compatible uncertainty frameworks. It is worth noting that this approach deviates from the typical approach to qualitative management of uncertainty, in which specific axioms are predefined to admit only relations that satisfy them. Here, conversely, the aim is to identify the reasonable rules to work with based on a fixed preference relation.

To conclude, this appendix provides a brief overview of the various generalizations of probability measures discussed in the paper. The material presented here is not exhaustive or comprehensive but serves as an informal introduction to the subject. Interested readers may refer to the widely available literature for a more detailed treatment of the relationships between probability measures, belief functions, and possibility measures, with introductory resources including [29], [33], and [45].
