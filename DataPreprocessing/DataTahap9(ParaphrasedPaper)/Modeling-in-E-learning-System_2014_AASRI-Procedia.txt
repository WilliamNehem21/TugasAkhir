In the field of educational material design, there are typically three or four main approaches: behaviorism, cognitivism, socio-constructivism, and humanism. The strategies associated with behaviorism focus on presenting factual information and demonstrating mathematical methods, such as the natural spline method, used in the course. Cognitivist strategies aim to teach processes and procedures involved in applying numerical methods, while constructivist strategies aim to promote higher-level thinking skills.

To prepare students for online lessons and demonstrate the benefits of online learning, various pre-learning activities can be employed. Furthermore, a range of learning activities can be offered to help students achieve the intended learning outcomes. Interacting with online materials and engaging with peers and instructors are essential for students to access and internalize the knowledge necessary for building a solid understanding. The course should also allow for opportunities for students to apply what they've learned to real-life situations.

The role of online course designers and educators is to select, adapt, and refine educational activities that leverage the potential of online platforms, and to continually improve these activities through reflection, feedback, and evaluation. Developing a model is typically the initial step in formulating a theory, as the model serves to illustrate the key variables that interact to shape the online learning context and experiences.
