The utilization of event-based data transfer for tele-monitoring through wireless body sensor networks (WBSN) offers an advanced method of real-time data transmission, presenting a significant advantage for the medical field and the elderly. However, the transmission of reliable and real-time data in this tele-monitoring technique is still under investigation due to challenges posed by data interference between sensors, data loss, and the transmission of redundant data. Research efforts are currently underway to address these issues.

This study focuses on the transmission of data during the tele-monitoring of the elderly using WBSN. Various data transmission techniques and models are examined for delivering sensor data with minimal latency, low energy consumption, and high reliability. The research identifies problems in WBSN during tele-monitoring and analyzes algorithms, techniques, and frameworks from related research. The best current solution for data transmission in WBSN is then scrutinized and enhanced to overcome its limitations, with mathematical and theoretical justifications provided for the proposed modifications. Subsequently, the proposed solution is simulated to evaluate the transmitted health data within WBSN as part of an event-based scheme, and the simulation processes are analyzed in terms of reliability, latency, and energy consumption.

After the simulation, the overall system results in a 0.056-second delay during transmission, an improvement over the previous figure of 0.059 seconds. This enhancement overlooks hidden terminals like WiFi and Zigbee but does not furnish an alternative backup path for packets that were interfered with or collided. The paper aims to improve end-to-end delay in WBSN, thereby potentially benefiting the current project. Similarly, an approach by Alfa et al. tackled the issue of delay during data transmission in WBSN, achieving a 0.03-second delay for sensitive medical packets, an improvement over the previous 0.06 seconds. However, it failed to decrease the complexity of the network during network recoveries. While these studies offer significant benefits to the proposed solution, they also introduce complexity in the WBSN.

Another technique focusing on improving the quality of links and congestion during data transmission in wireless sensor networks (WSN) is discussed. This technique provides an effective method of channel allocation for faulty links and offers an estimated link quality for all links, resulting in a 20% improvement in the data delivery ratio when compared with the RTCS technique. However, the movement of body sensor nodes was not considered, potentially impacting the entire network and link quality. This solution is valuable for the current project, as it emphasizes link quality and the transmission of reliable data in WSN.

Continuous data transmission in WBSN consumes significant amounts of energy by sensors and causes data interference, leading to delays in the overall system. These issues can be mitigated by minimizing redundant data bits during transmission over WBSN. The state-of-the-art solution of event-based data transfer minimizes end-to-end delay and provides reliable data transfer, though it still experiences data loss during transmission due to sensor interference and the transfer of unused or redundant bits. Addressing this problem could lead to improvements in reliability, interference, and latency in WBSN. Therefore, the current solution, while offering benefits, has limitations in terms of power consumption, processing time, and reliability, which have been addressed in the proposed solution.

Tele-monitoring using wireless body sensor networks (WBSN) through event-based data transfer is crucial for monitoring the health of the elderly by allowing remote monitoring by doctors. However, issues related to network reliability, end-to-end delay, power consumption, and sensor interference have been persistent challenges. Traditional methods, such as periodic and priority-based data transfer, have proven effective for small WBSN but have shown limitations when applied to large networks. New strategies have been proposed to minimize problems caused by the state-of-the-art solution, such as reducing the transmission of redundant bits to the cloud and addressing interference due to multiple sensors in large networks. The proposed solution has shown to be efficient in energy saving and has improved the latency and reliability of transmitted data bits. Future research should focus on localizing and remotely tracking the elderly using tele-monitoring processes, which could be important for continuously monitoring behaviors and activities in emergency situations. Finally, it is important to note that the proposed solution only deals with body sensors worn on the body and does not consider sensors implanted in the brain or elsewhere, which could provide more accurate health results.
