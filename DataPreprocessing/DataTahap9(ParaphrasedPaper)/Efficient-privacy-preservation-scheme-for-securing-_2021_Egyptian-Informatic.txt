In order to address the performance and security challenges faced by users with similar interests in the urban peer-to-peer vehicular ad-hoc network (up2pvanet), a confidentiality and security scheme known as CSP2P has been introduced. This scheme aims to establish a robust certification framework and includes an intelligent cooperative detection system that leverages homomorphic encryption for detecting routing attacks. The proposed CSP2P scheme has been integrated into the implementation of the AODV routing protocol, and simulation results have demonstrated its efficacy in detecting black hole attacks and reducing transmission delays in the up2pvanet environment, leading to an overall system performance enhancement of nearly 10% under varied load conditions.

Due to the mobility of vehicle users, communication can occur within a vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) or with peer-to-peer (P2P) nodes. In the urban peer-to-peer vehicular ad-hoc networks (up2pvanet), multiple vehicle users (VUs) sharing similar interests, such as multimedia data or e-books, can exchange resources among themselves using P2P or VANET networks. To facilitate these interactions, an effective certification scheme has been proposed, wherein mobile proxies (MPs) send certificates and private keys to VU nodes, enabling the nodes to re-sign and verify the certificates using proxy re-signature cryptography technology.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 reviews existing literature on video streaming over P2P and VANET networks, as well as privacy-preservation and security schemes for VANETs. Section 3 discusses the application of the CSP2P scheme to a video data replication model and presents a replication algorithm. Section 4 presents a security analysis of the proposed CSP2P scheme, while Section 5 evaluates the solution based on simulation results. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper and provides recommendations for future research.

Moreover, a method for selecting a group of strategically re-broadcasted (REViV) nodes for video streaming in VANETs has been proposed in this context. This method introduces a new metric called diffusion capacity (DC) to classify vehicle nodes and has been shown to outperform other video streaming mechanisms in terms of end-to-end transmission delay, frame loss rate, and video transmission rate, particularly in environments with fully or intermittently connected networks.

The use of homomorphic encryption in VANETs has been relatively low, with limited research in this area. Techniques such as fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) secured with two multi-key identities, threshold FHEs with monotonic Boolean formulas, algebraic FHEs with multivariate polynomials, and FHEs with sorting on encrypted data have been proposed. Researchers have also explored the application of FHE with reduced time for encryption, decryption, and re-encryption, as well as challenges on integers and error-based FHE for practical applications. Various cryptographic operations, such as bit shift, arithmetic, comparison, and logic, have been performed using cryptosystems based on the Brakerski-Gentry-Vaikuntanathan (BGV) scheme.

The confidentiality and security scheme (CSP2P) discussed in this paper is applied to the urban P2P VANET network and is particularly relevant to the components of the up2pvanet network, specifically the vehicle nodes. The application of the CSP2P scheme varies based on attack types, authentication of vehicle nodes, and the integrity and confidentiality of video data. A key aspect of the proposed scheme is the use of proxy re-signature cryptography technology to facilitate an efficient recovery strategy when certificates expire or are revoked.

In summary, the paper focuses on addressing performance and security challenges in the urban peer-to-peer VANET environment through the introduction of the CSP2P scheme, which integrates certification and detection mechanisms to enhance system performance and security. The paper also reviews existing literature on video streaming over P2P and VANET networks, and privacy-preservation and security schemes for VANETs, and presents a thorough evaluation of the proposed scheme through simulation results.
