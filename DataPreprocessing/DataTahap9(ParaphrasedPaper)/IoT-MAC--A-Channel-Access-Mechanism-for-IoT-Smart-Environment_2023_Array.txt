The development of machine-to-machine (M2M) communication has facilitated the exchange of instructions and information between machines without human involvement. M2M networks, comprising a large number of interconnected devices, are anticipated to be widely utilized in smart spaces such as homes, workplaces, healthcare settings, smart cities, industrial automation, and smart parking. To efficiently manage extensive Internet of Things (IoT) applications, a wireless network technology for M2M communication is deemed essential.

The IEEE 802.11ah standard, also known as Wi-Fi HaLow, is expected to be a viable solution for M2M communications in the future. It offers several promising features, including a transmission range of up to 1 km in outdoor areas, a data rate of at least 100 kbps, and the capability to accommodate up to 8191 devices with an access point. This standard employs a hierarchical identifier structure, known as an association identifier (AID), to handle a large number of stations effectively. The paper is organized into four sections, encompassing discussions on related works of IEEE 802.11ah, the proposed model for bidirectional traffic optimization, performance evaluation of the proposed scheme, and concluding remarks.

The article introduces a mechanism for raw formation in an IEEE 802.11ah network with both uplink and downlink traffic (i.e., bidirectional traffic). The proposed scheme addresses the challenges associated with determining the optimal raw size for event-driven downlink and periodic uplink traffic. It accurately predicts traffic patterns and schedules them with minimal contention, thereby improving throughput, latency, packet delivery ratio, and energy consumption. The experimental analysis underscores the significance of the proposed scheme for extensive and latency-aware saturated networks.

In future work, the authors aim to optimize the raw size by taking historical data into account across heterogeneous application scenarios, particularly in the context of decision-making for actuation in smart environments.
