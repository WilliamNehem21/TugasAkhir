The property of multiscaleness in biochemical networks is closely linked to the mathematical concept of dominance, as described in the framework of tropical analysis [1, 21]. Recently, a set of semi-formal methods has been developed to reduce and hybridize models of biochemical networks, drawing on ideas from tropical analysis [26, 27, 28, 29]. These methods leverage the multiscaleness of biochemical networks to derive dominance relationships among parameters and/or reaction rates, which can be used to derive a system of truncated ordinary differential equations (ODEs) by eliminating the dominated terms. One advantage of using dominance relationships in multiscale networks is their ability to handle parameter uncertainty: instead of specific parameter values, the orders of magnitude are used, which are easier to determine. However, providing assurances about how the solution of the reduced model relates to the original model remains a challenge. This is also the case in our proposed reduction framework for rule-based models, which is based on time-scale separation. While this technique is justified by asymptotic convergence results, there is no information on the accuracy of the trajectories obtained from executing the reduced model for specific parameter values.

The Michaelis-Menten system serves as a specific and simple case study: the choice of reaction rate constants determines the dominance region in which the system evolves. In general, the state of a biochemical network can traverse multiple such regions, as the dominant monomials can change from one concentration domain to another. Therefore, we introduce a case study in which the dominant monomials are concentration-dependent, meaning that the dominance region is not fixed. Our method is designed to address this more general situation: after computing the most accurate bounds for each region of the state space partitioning, and lacking information about the region in which the original system evolves at a given time t, our approach selects the least accurate local bound to ensure global soundness.

The occurrence of a variable xj in fk,l(xi) with one of its expressions eb(xj) (or with its appropriate bound derived from eb(xj)) results in another safe upper bound for f(xi). By selecting the minimum such candidate bound, the most accurate, locally safe upper bound is obtained. The same rationale applies to the computation of lower bounds, but the min operation is replaced with max.

Finally, the interpretation of the variables is extended to the hyper-faces. Instances of xi are replaced with their corresponding analogues aligned with the desired hyper-face we want to bound, while others are replaced with their analogues based on the polarity of their occurrences, as explained in note 2.5.

The conservation law y1(t) + y2(t) + y3(t) + y4(t) = 1 applies, where the value 1 denotes the total initial concentration of kinase cdc2 (i.e., y1(0) + y2(0) + y3(0) + y4(0)), chosen for convenience. The values of the reaction rate constants are fixed to make the model display oscillatory behavior: k1 = 0.015, k3 = 200, k4 = 180, kj = 0.018, k6 = 1, k8 = 103, k9 = 106.
