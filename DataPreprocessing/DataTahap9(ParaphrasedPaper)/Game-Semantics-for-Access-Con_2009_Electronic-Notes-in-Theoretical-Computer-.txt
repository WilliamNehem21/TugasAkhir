This academic paper presents a semantic approach to the study of logics for access control and dependency analysis using game semantics. The authors introduce a variant of AJM games with explicit justification but without pointers, and use this to provide a simple and intuitive model of the information flow constraints underlying access control. The paper includes a detailed discussion of various sections including the development of the variant of AJM games, the games model for access control, a semantic treatment of non-interference theorems, a brief discussion of the relation to syntax, and a conclusion with a discussion of future directions for work.

The paper also compares the new definition to that of standard AJM games, highlighting the new component of the justification function ja, which leads to a simpler statement of the well-bracketing condition and introduces new conditions on plays. The authors demonstrate several transformations of plays and discuss the correspondence of erasing tags in the definition of composition for higher-order games.

The authors state that the main focus of the paper is on a semantic approach to access control, and they have provided semantic versions of a number of non-interference results. While the paper does not extensively delve into how these relate to results obtained through syntactic and proof-theoretic means for calculi such as dcc, it does provide an illustrative example of how semantic non-interference results can be utilized to obtain results about syntactic calculi.
