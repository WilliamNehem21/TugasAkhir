The utilization of extended reality (XR) in education is increasingly popular as a means to revolutionize traditional classrooms with immersive learning environments. There is a growing interest in leveraging immersive learning as an innovative method for teaching science and engineering subjects, due to advancements in XR interaction techniques and artificial intelligence. This paper introduces a novel approach that employs machine learning agents to facilitate interactive kinesthetic learning in science and engineering education through real-time hand interaction in the virtual world. A case study related to chemistry is used to implement this approach, and a usability evaluation involving 15 expert reviewers and 2 subject experts is presented. This evaluation employs the NASA Task Load Index to measure cognitive workload and the Technology Acceptance Model to assess perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness. The findings suggest that self-directed learning using trained agents can aid in technical topic learning, and controller-free hand interaction can enhance hands-on learning motivation in virtual laboratories. This success signifies a new research area where agents implemented in immersive environments using machine learning techniques can serve as both educators and assessors.

The integration of XR, commonly referred to as immersive learning, is seen as a promising technology for creating interactive learning content and providing practical experiences for understanding complex technical concepts. There has been rapid growth in the adoption of head-mounted displays and smart glasses, leading to enhanced immersion capabilities and accessibility. Immersive learning environments (ILE) are viewed as revolutionary interactive platforms that hold potential for personalized learning experiences. However, the use of real-time hand interaction for kinesthetic learning and agent-oriented approaches to support self-guided learning in immersive environments are not extensively explored. This research proposes increased user interaction using real-time hand-interaction technologies and incorporating intelligent agents to make immersive learning more user-centered and self-guided.

Various studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of immersive technology in enhancing learning experiences, particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. These studies have highlighted the unique opportunities for learners to engage with real-world phenomena in controlled environments. Despite the substantial research in XR, there is still a need to explore its future use in resource-constrained and remote environments, as well as the untapped potential of intelligent agents in immersive learning.

It is crucial to evaluate and assess immersive learning applications to ensure their effectiveness and value in the learning process. This study aims to assess the impact, interactiveness, and value creation of immersive learning with machine learning agents. The evaluation study focuses on the learning goals of basic chemical reactions at the secondary school level, as well as the factors of learning gain, cognitive load, and user confidence.

The findings suggest that machine learning can facilitate self-directed learning in immersive environments, with participants indicating positive interactions with the application and minimal cognitive workload. Additionally, the integration of AI or machine learning agents in immersive learning environments has the potential to create personalized and engaging learning experiences, although ethical and privacy considerations need to be addressed.

Despite its contributions, the study has limitations, including the need for further end-user experiments and control group assessments. Nevertheless, it offers valuable insights into the potential of XR and machine learning in immersive learning environments, particularly in STEM education.
