In this paper, we examine a category of extended automata that are described by guarded commands over Presburger arithmetic with uninterpreted functions. The study demonstrates the decidability of the bounded reachability problem within this model. Furthermore, the practical application of this model is showcased by its utility in modeling programs with unbounded data structures, with the reachability procedure being applicable for activities such as symbolic simulation, testing, and verification.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces the theory of Presburger arithmetic with uninterpreted function symbols. Section 3 defines a class of extended automata, referred to as "pf-automata," with guards and assignments within a decidable fragment of this theory. The initial condition of the automata may restrict an unbounded number of function values, and assignments may modify an unbounded number of such values. In Section 4, a decision procedure for the bounded reachability problem in pf-automata is presented, based on symbolic analysis techniques and implemented using the ICS decision procedure package from SRI International. Finally, Section 5 includes conclusions, related work, and future work.

Additionally, the paper explores the existential fragment of pf (i.e., allowing only existential quantifiers and an even number of negations within their scope), demonstrating its decidability. The paper also leverages and extends the results in Section 4 to discuss valuations, states, transitions, and assignments in the context of pf-automata.

Furthermore, the paper delves into the modifiability of valuations by assignments, including variable assignments and function assignments. The inductive step of the pf-automaton is discussed, assuming the existence of a single function symbol f, and the formulation of the predicate post is presented. The paper concludes with a discussion of the semi-universal formulas and the reachability checking process, along with preliminary results from a symbolic analysis prototype.

It is also highlighted that an extension of pf-automata with universal guards leads to increased expressiveness, making reachability highly undecidable even in one step, which hinders its applicability for symbolic simulation.
