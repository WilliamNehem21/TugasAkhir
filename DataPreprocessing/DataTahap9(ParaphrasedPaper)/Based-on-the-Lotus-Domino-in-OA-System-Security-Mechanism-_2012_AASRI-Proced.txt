This study focuses on the implementation of office automation systems, which has yielded positive outcomes. The system encompasses features such as email, process management, information dissemination, project management, remote office functionality, and others. These functions have significantly enhanced internal management and office efficiency, presenting extensive potential applications. The system's notable position in commercial office settings is attributed to its comprehensive workflow control, robust database replication technology, and advanced and reliable security mechanisms. The paper explores various security technologies used in Lotus Domino/Notes.

The "Lotus Domino/Notes Office Management Information System" is an application utilized in college office management information systems. It operates on a three-tier architecture (B/A/S), with the front-end leveraging browser technology (e.g., IE 6.0), the application layer based on Lotus Domino/Notes R5.0.8 incorporating LotusScript, Java, SQL, and JavaScript, and the database service layer using SQL Server 2000. The system's business logic encompasses data management, application control, and user interface layers.

Authorization roles dictate specific permissions for system users. For instance, the secretary of the general administration office is authorized to modify documents, edit document numbers, handle confidentiality, determine degree of urgency, manage principal receivers, carbon copies, reports, subject terms, and more. Similarly, staff in the print room have authorization for tasks such as typesetting documents and managing document details.

A two-way design is employed in the system at four steps, allowing for reversible procedures and providing the flexibility to repeat operations and make improvements or adapt to unexpected changes. The secretary of the general administration office holds a central role in document issuing management within this workflow. The two-way design enables the secretary to address emerging document issuance issues in response to work demands.
