The paper discusses various models of membrane systems that incorporate objects attached to the membranes, inspired by symport/antiport rules governing cellular transport processes. Models bridging brane calculus and membrane systems have also been proposed, including a more general approach that considers both free-floating objects and objects attached to the membranes. These models aim to show that membrane operations are influenced by the presence of proteins attached to the membranes, which is crucial in biological processes such as receptor-mediated endocytosis, exocytosis, and budding in eukaryotic cells.

Eukaryotic cells utilize these processes to uptake macromolecules and transport them to lysosomes for processing. The paper introduces the concept of pure matrix grammars and discusses the language generated by them. It also defines the marking of membranes and introduces attachment and evolution rules to model cellular processes and biochemical reactions occurring within cell compartments.

Furthermore, the paper presents a simulator that implements a stochastic variant of the introduced model. The simulator is designed to model biological processes where the transport of objects across membranes is coupled with the processing and decay of substances within regions. As an example, the simulation of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae heterotrimeric G-protein cycle is provided. The paper concludes with a note about the use of symbols to represent the internal, external, and integral markings of the membrane, as well as a discussion on the evolution step and time unit conventions used in simulations.
