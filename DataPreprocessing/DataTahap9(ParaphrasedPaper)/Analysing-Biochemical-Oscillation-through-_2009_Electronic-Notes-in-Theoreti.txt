When dealing with complex biological systems that display intricate patterns of behavior, it may be challenging to ascertain whether the system dynamics satisfy certain interesting properties. One such property, often vaguely defined, is the oscillatory behavior characteristic of many biological systems. While it is relatively easy to visually infer the presence of oscillations in simulated time courses, it is more difficult to precisely determine whether the oscillations will persist indefinitely or eventually cease, either by gradually damping down or abruptly halting. In this regard, the abstraction employed by ordinary differential equation (ODE) models offers certain advantages, as the deterministic approach ensures that any periodic evolution will repeat indefinitely. However, as we will explore in this paper, such properties may seem to hold true only due to the continuous approximation. On the other hand, results obtained from discrete stochastic models can still provide indications of the existence of oscillatory behaviors, but the noise introduced by stochastic fluctuations may make them appear less pronounced. Furthermore, in cases where oscillations exist but their phase, period, and amplitude also vary stochastically, analyzing multiple simulation traces over time does not aid in characterizing the long-term behavior of the system.

In this paper, we present two examples of biochemical system models from existing literature as case studies to illustrate the benefits of a formal approach to defining and verifying properties of biological systems, including oscillatory behaviors. The primary contribution of this paper is the introduction of a formal approach to specifying properties based on probabilistic computation tree logic (PCTL) and continuous stochastic logic (CSL). PCTL/CSL formulas can precisely define properties of system dynamics, such as converging to a fixed value, bounded oscillation around a fixed value, perpetual alternation of growth and decrease phases, and relationships among multiple variables. These formulas define a query language in which a user can encode a property of the systems they intend to verify. Probabilistic model checkers that accept PCTL formulas defined over the variables of a discrete stochastic model can then be used to verify whether the property holds for the system. In this paper, we demonstrate how the Prism model checker can be utilized for this purpose. We apply our formal approach to the example models to illustrate how system properties can be characterized and to showcase the insights that can be gained into system dynamics through verification with Prism. We highlight the clear advantages provided by the exact quantitative solutions returned by a model-checking tool, whereas simulation of stochastic models can only provide statistically approximate solutions. Our proposed approach is applicable to general models of biological systems, with the current limitation being that only models with a bounded state space are amenable to analysis.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the basics of biochemical oscillators and illustrates a specific system that will be used as the ongoing example throughout the paper. Section 3 examines the use of temporal logic as a means to encode relevant features of oscillating systems. Section 4 briefly describes probabilistic model checking. Section 5 analyzes the structural properties of the Markovian model of our ongoing example, and the verification using the Prism model checker is illustrated in Section 6. We summarize our contribution in the final section of the paper.

We note that, while continuous deterministic modeling is a useful method for gaining insights into system behavior, it has some drawbacks. For example, as we will demonstrate, the oscillation in system (2.1) is transient, but this fundamental characteristic cannot be revealed through ODE analysis. Furthermore, the system of ODEs (2.2) allows for some trivial fixed points, such as a0 = b0 = c0 (given that ka = kb = kc). The solution of (2.2) for an initial condition corresponding to any such fixed point will indicate that the system does not evolve at all, whereas in reality, the system will certainly evolve for any initial condition such that a0 > 0, b0 > 0, and c0 > 0.

Alternative approaches to simulating discrete stochastic models are provided by Markovian analysis techniques and/or probabilistic/stochastic model checking. In the following section, we introduce the basics of temporal logic and model checking and demonstrate how relevant properties of systems of biochemical reactions can be stated as (probabilistic) temporal logic queries, which can be automatically verified against a discrete stochastic model. First, we introduce a permanent oscillation variant of our ongoing example.
