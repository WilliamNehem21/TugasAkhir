In recent times, several approaches have focused on defining non-syntactic models of spatial logics. For example, spatial logics have been applied to specific types of graph rewriting systems rather than to the terminologies of a particular process calculus. In this context, a non-syntactic interpretation of parallel decomposition has been introduced by integrating spatial information into the language semantics through a coalgebraic model named spatial transition systems (STS). This model has been utilized as a semantic model for a process calculus similar to CCS, demonstrating that the STS semantics support full concurrency (e.g., the processes a.b+b.a and a|b have distinct meanings). Unlike other interpretations, the STS semantics are based on reaction rules, rendering behavioral observations of isolated subsystems impossible.

In contrast to previous interpretations, this new approach allows for the observation of the parallel decomposition of a process only when the involved subprocesses are reactive, meaning that they can synchronize with other processes at some point (similarly to the location semantics of CCS). The resulting spatial logic transition systems (SLTS) bisimulation inherently contains the ordinary CCS bisimulation and is coarser than structural congruence. This concept measures the minimum available quantity of a specific type of resource (represented by a process that can perform action a) after the occurrence of event b. In the realm of multi-valued logics, this type of formula can be compared to the challenges associated with history-dependent access control policies. In this scenario, the measurement of resource usage policies depends on the past history of execution, analogous to the validity of policies in history-dependent access control.
