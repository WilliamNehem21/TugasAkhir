The free ports of the linear combination itself can be regarded as connectors for general nets, not just simple nets. By utilizing these free ports, it is possible to link together general nets by applying multi-linearity. This results in a reduction to a two-parameter function h, expressed as h(y', z') = f(y' + z', y' + z'). It is evident that the function represented by the net is preserved when the variables y' and z' are duplicated before addition, as opposed to duplicating them after addition as in the previous net. 

Now, let's consider a version of the resource lambda-calculus where the application is genuinely linear, rather than affine. The syntax we introduce comprises two kinds of terms: simple terms and simple poly-terms, both of which are defined by mutual induction. As usual, we assume a countable supply of variables.
