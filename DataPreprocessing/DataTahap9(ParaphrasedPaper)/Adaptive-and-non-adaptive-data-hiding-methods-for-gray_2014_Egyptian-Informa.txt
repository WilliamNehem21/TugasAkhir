Currently, the transmission of messages on the internet is confronted with issues such as data security and copyright control. Consequently, there is a need for confidential communication schemes to facilitate message transmission on the internet. Encryption offers a secure method by transforming data into ciphertext using cipher algorithms. However, while encryption renders the message unreadable, it also renders the message suspicious enough to attract attention.

The paper introduces five secret keys, namely r1, r2, v1, v2, t, where 1 ≤ v1, 1 ≤ v2, and (v1 + v2) < 6. The average different values of a four-pixel block are employed to categorize the block as either a smooth area or an edge area. The range of average different values is divided into two levels: smooth level and edge level. A q-bit of secret data is embedded in pixels within the block, with q being determined by the level to which the average different values belong. During the data embedding process, the smooth level uses the lower value v1, while the edge level uses the greater value v1 + v2. The paper provides details of the data embedding process in section 3.1.1 and describes the extraction phase in section 3.1.2.

In step 5, for each pixel yi in the block, a certain number of bits of secret data sq, based on the level of the block, are divided. For edge blocks, sq is divided into two pieces, sq1 and sq2, where sq1 contains v1 bits and sq2 contains v2 bits. For smooth blocks, sq is divided into one piece, sq1, containing the same v1 bits.

For example, the paper discusses an embedding example in a nonadaptive algorithm. The stego-pixels are identified as 17 and 237. The values of kr, kc are {0011, 0001, 0000, 0010, 1111, 1101, 1100,..., 0101, 0100, 0110}, with q = v1 + v2 = 2 + 2 = 4, and n = 7.8.0.347 (r2009a) program on the Windows XP platform. The authors utilized a series of pseudo-random numbers as the secret data to be embedded into the cover images, and also employed the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) value to assess the quality of the stego-images. The PSNR is defined as follows.
