The conventional least squares data fitting method is inadequate for fitting vector data with a random independent variable. This paper introduces a new criterion for data fitting, which minimizes the sum of geometric distances, and presents a new scattered data fitting method based on this criterion. Additionally, the paper presents an optimization algorithm for solving the data fitting parameters. Simulation experiments demonstrate that the new method achieves higher fitting precision than the least squares method for vector data with a random independent variable.

Previous research has extensively explored the least squares fitting method and developed various approaches such as principal component regression (PCR), partial least squares (PLS), various non-linear principal component regression (NLPCR), various non-linear partial least squares (NLPLS), neural network methods, and the synthesis of these methods, which are widely used in current projects. However, this article does not utilize the methods mentioned above for scatterpoint fitting. Instead, it proposes a new data fitting method based on the minimum sum of geometric distances as the new fitting standard. The method includes model transformation, which converts the fitting parameter solution into a "constrained optimization problem," and provides an algorithm for solving the fitting parameters. The simulation experiment confirms the feasibility and effectiveness of the fitting parameter solution algorithm; it shows that the new data fitting method achieves higher fitting precision for vector data with a random independent variable compared to the least squares method.
