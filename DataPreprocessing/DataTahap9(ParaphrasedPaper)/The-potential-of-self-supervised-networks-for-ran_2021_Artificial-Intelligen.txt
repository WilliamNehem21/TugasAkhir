In this study, we explore the adaptation of the n2v workflow to address the highly oscillatory nature of seismic signal and pseudorandom noise. We conduct a thorough analysis of hyper-parameters to determine the most effective settings for seismic denoising, considering both immediate improvements in the image domain and downstream tasks such as seismic inversion. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential of n2v through its application to a field dataset.

We also present a mathematical formulation in Appendix 1 to clarify the circumstances under which mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) should be utilized. Additionally, we note that there is no theoretical guarantee for correlated noise, and as a result, we experiment with both loss functions in numerical examples.

Our findings show that the optimal hyper-parameter combination is determined by evaluating each combination across all three scoring criteria. We observe a moderate increase in the acoustic impedance domain, while the batch size has limited influence in comparison to other hyper-parameters.

We acknowledge the contributions of A. Krull, T.-O. Buchholz, and F. Jug for open-sourcing their TensorFlow implementation of noise2void. Furthermore, we express our gratitude for the use of the resources of the supercomputing laboratory at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) in Thuwal, Saudi Arabia.
