To comprehensively evaluate a local area, three sets of experiments were carried out using a dual-manipulator system with 12 degrees of freedom. The experimental results demonstrate that adaptive region boosting (ARB) effectively enhances the success rate and surpasses all other related methods across various dynamic scenarios.

Path planning, a core area of research in robotics, has found applications in fields such as aviation, industrial manufacturing, and games/virtual reality. The generalized motion planning problem has been proven to be PSPACE-hard, leading to the proposal of sampling-based methods to reduce computational complexity. The Probabilistic Roadmap Method (PRM) and Rapidly Exploring Random Tree (RRT) are among the most successful methods, offering probabilistic completeness. Over the past two decades, various PRM variants have achieved significant success in solving path planning problems, even in complex environments.

By capturing both spatial and temporal information to assess the degree of change in local regions during the updating phase, our approach entails two steps. In the preprocessing phase, a hierarchical sampling strategy is utilized to construct a roadmap with two layers of samples. In the updating phase, additional samples are adaptively activated in challenging regions to enhance sampling density within those areas.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 outlines related works, Section 3 provides details of our method, Section 4 reports on the analysis of three groups of experiments, and finally, Section 5 presents the conclusions.

Several bridge builder planners have been developed to address challenging regions in dynamic environments, such as the Dynamic Bridge Builder (DBB). In the preprocessing phase, DBB generates sample points and constructs a new roadmap similar to DRAM. It then calculates midpoints of edges in the roadmap and generates incremental points around those midpoints. Subsequently, it computes the workspace-cell (W-C) mapping of sampling points to ensure their validity. In the updating phase, DBB dynamically rebuilds new bridges by traversing all the edges.

When challenging regions are identified by DBB in the updating phase, two strategies are employed to enhance these regions. The first strategy is to activate incremental points around the bridges, which involves consuming more time to compute the W-C mapping for these incremental points during the preprocessing phase. The second strategy involves predicting the validity of incremental points using the Parzen-Window estimation during the updating phase and postponing collision detections to the query phase.

Various machine learning algorithms have been used to estimate the probability density of valid sampling points in a local area. This paper employs active learning algorithms, utilizing the Parzen-Window estimation method for density estimation.

Estimating the difficulty level of a region in real-time poses a crucial challenge. In this paper, the difficult degree of a region can be roughly estimated using the information from a few sampling points. Biased entropy of a valid point represents the difficulty level of the local region around that point. The difference in biased entropy between two adjacent frames can evaluate the degree of change in a region over time. Building upon this difference, an Adaptive Region Boosting (ARB) method is proposed to enhance challenging regions and effectively find a clear path.

Given that obstacles move in workspace (W-space), corresponding changes occur in configuration space (C-space). When these changes take place between frames, the difference in biased entropy can effectively represent the degree of change in the region.

In ARB, the parameter value of k significantly impacts the planner's performance, as it influences the entropy value calculated using the k-nearest neighbors method. A series of experiments with different k values was conducted to determine the optimal k for various scenarios.

Notably, the Adaptive Region Boosting (ARB) method demonstrates superior performance compared to other related methods in various environments. It effectively accounts for the changing degree of environments and exhibits excellent universality. Future work may involve excavating information on regions in the DRAM method, tracking obstacle movements, and forecasting the changing of difficult regions. Additionally, developing predictive models to capture the motion of regions is a prospective avenue for research.
