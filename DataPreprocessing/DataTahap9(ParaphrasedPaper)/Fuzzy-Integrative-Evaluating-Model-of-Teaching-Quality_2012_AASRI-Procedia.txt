The selection of an appropriate estimation method is crucial for various types of educational processes. To address the limitations of conventional teaching estimation methods, this paper introduces an integrative evaluation model based on fuzzy logic for handling the assessment of multiple variables. The paper provides a detailed discussion on the design process involved in constructing the fuzzy logic-based model. Empirical data analysis demonstrates the successful application of the proposed model, indicating its effectiveness in addressing multi-variable teaching evaluation processes.

Fuzzy logic, initially proposed by Prof. L. A. Zadeh from the University of California at Berkeley in 1965, saw its first implementation in a steam engine by Mamdani in 1974. Since then, fuzzy logic has been widely utilized in various successful applications, yielding significant accomplishments.

Evaluation of teaching quality is a critical aspect for educators and typically involves a multivariable process with numerous evaluation methods employed in practical settings. This paper introduces a fuzzy integrative estimation model to overcome the limitations of standard estimation methods and generate reliable evaluation results. By utilizing the sum-product method to calculate the eigenvector of each evaluation index, the fuzzy estimating model yields satisfactory results, supported by standardization procedures and practical application data. Overall, the findings indicate that the fuzzy estimating model is highly effective for multivariable processes.
