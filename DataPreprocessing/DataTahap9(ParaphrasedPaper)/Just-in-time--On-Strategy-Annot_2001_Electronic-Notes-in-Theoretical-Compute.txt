The research paper explores simple strategy annotations and their impacts on strategy classes, such as leftmost-innermost. It demonstrates that, with specific restrictions on annotations, an interpreter can be developed to compute the normal form of a term in a bottom-up manner. The paper's primary contribution is a proof of the correctness of this interpreter. Additionally, it introduces a default strategy annotation known as just-in-time, which meets the interpreter's criteria and exhibits better termination behavior than innermost rewriting for various examples.

The paper asserts the significance of strategy languages in enabling users to specify program transformations. However, it notes that these strategies may not always be complete, as a strategy might terminate in a term that still contains redexes. Currently, there is no analysis available to determine whether certain subclasses of these strategies are complete, which is an important consideration for finding normal forms.

The authors make comparisons with strategy annotations present in the obj-family and CafeOBJ, highlighting similarities and differences and noting the necessity of certain conditions to achieve completeness.

The paper also delves into the de nitions and implementation of term rewriting systems, strategies, and associated strategies. It explains that the correctness proof of the interpreter ensures that the interpreter operates using a memory-less strategy, even in cases of divergence.

To facilitate understanding, the paper provides some examples illustrating how specific annotations impact the normalization process and stresses the significance of adherence to necessary conditions.

The authors introduce and describe the just-in-time strategy, highlighting its specific characteristics and implementation considerations.

Ultimately, the paper discusses implementing an interpreter for a term rewriting system annotated with a strategy, along with related implementation considerations and issues, and concludes with acknowledgments and references.
