The levels of VCO were found to increase when fish were infected with Streptococcus iniae, while plasma metabolite indicators among the treatments remained unchanged. Using VCO at a 3% inclusion level in the diet resulted in excellent performance, suggesting that it could completely replace fish oil and thus serve as a preferable alternative lipid source for feeding Nile tilapia.

Fish oil and fish meal are key protein components in aquaculture feed, and their demand significantly impacts production costs. An increased demand for these components may elevate feed production costs, potentially affecting production rates and the industry's ability to sustain growth. Moreover, the heightened demand for fish oil has led to the overexploitation of certain fish species, which are of low economic value and less utilized for human consumption. This situation poses concerns for the sustainability of fish populations and the aquaculture industry.

The fish were fed one of five experimental diets twice daily, and their feed intake was recorded. The growth, feed utilization, and survival of the fish were monitored, while tanks were regularly cleaned.

The inclusion of VCO caused a significant decrease in the n-3 series, particularly in the 22:6(n-3) fatty acid. The fatty acid profile of the fish was affected by the inclusion of VCO, resulting in lower levels of n-3 fatty acids. Additionally, the profile of saturated fatty acids in the fish was impacted by the dietary intake of these fatty acids. Despite an increase in dietary EPA, the fish fatty acid profiles did not reflect this change. However, DHA levels in the tissue fatty acid profiles increased, indicating the fish's ability to convert EPA and most saturated fatty acids to maintain long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids.

The study showed that fish have a limited ability to effectively incorporate long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids into muscle lipids, leading to a disproportionate increase in other less desirable unsaturated fatty acids, competing with more desirable fatty acids and impacting tissue nutritional value.

Conflicting information exists regarding the impact of dietary essential fatty acids on immune response and disease in fish. The study observed abnormalities in Nile tilapia red and white blood cell counts attributed to excessively high levels of preformed long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids in the diet. However, no significant effects were observed for red and white blood cell counts when fish were fed various other oils. The study also found that excessive levels of n-3 fatty acids decreased antibody titers and increased fish mortality. Notably, fish fed 3% VCO had the lowest mortality when challenged with Streptococcus iniae.

The fatty acid composition of virgin coconut oil was found to possess antibacterial, antiprotozoal, and antiviral properties, suggesting its potential to bolster the immune system of fish without compromising growth performance. These active fatty acid components were shown to have the ability to destroy pathogenic bacteria, lending support to the notion that monolaurin is an additional property of VCO fatty acids, which enhances the destruction of gram-negative bacteria. As such, VCO exhibits medicinal and therapeutic capabilities beneficial for fish immunity when included in their diet.
