The objective of this study is to utilize operator algebra theory to analyze the similarities and differences between probabilistic and quantum computations, with a focus on revealing their domain-theoretic and topological structure. This research seeks to bridge the gap between two distinct communities: theoretical computer scientists employing domain theory for program language semantics and logic, and the mathematicians and theoretical physicists utilizing w*-algebras. We also introduce a theorem that generalizes the concept of effects of a w*-algebra, demonstrating its directed-complete poset. Additionally, we establish a connection between monotone completeness in c*-algebras and directed completeness, an association not previously explicitly elucidated. Furthermore, we provide an order-theoretic characterization of w*-algebras by combining known facts about monotone completeness and proposition a.2. This paper presents a detailed exploration of the relationship between operator theory and order theory in the context of c*-algebras and w*-algebras.
