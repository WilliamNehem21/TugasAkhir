This paper introduces a timed extension for the rpoo, which is a petri-net based object-oriented modeling language. The proposed extension, called rpoot, is based on the timing strategy from the timed coloured petri nets formalism. The paper demonstrates the application of rpoot through the development of a simple stop-and-wait protocol rpoo model and presents performance measures for the model. The research shows that rpoot can be seamlessly integrated with timed coloured petri nets, enabling the modeling of time-consuming activities within objects and interactions between objects.

Additionally, the paper discusses the successful application of rpoo in modeling various systems, including academic and real-world applications such as the modeling and analysis of the mobile IP protocol. It highlights the challenges in explicitly expressing timing aspects in rpoo models and emphasizes the need for a timed extension to address time-constrained functionalities and performance analysis.

Furthermore, the paper outlines the integration of rpoo with timed coloured petri nets, incorporating a global clock and timestamped messages in rpoo models to support time-constrained functionality modeling and performance analysis. The proposed extension aims to provide rpoo with a timing strategy that inherits temporization aspects from petri nets, while also enabling the modeling of real-time systems.

The paper provides a detailed overview of rpoo and rpoot, presents a case study, and discusses the simulation and formal validation of the modeled network protocol. The research also highlights the unique characteristics of rpoot, such as its formal definition, support for model checking, and capability to model time delays using various statistical distributions. Additionally, it emphasizes rpoot's independence from the petri net model adopted to describe classes, demonstrating its integration with both timed and untimed net models.

Overall, this paper addresses the need for incorporating timing aspects into object-oriented modeling languages and presents rpoot as a viable solution for modeling real-time systems and conducting performance evaluations within the rpoo framework.
