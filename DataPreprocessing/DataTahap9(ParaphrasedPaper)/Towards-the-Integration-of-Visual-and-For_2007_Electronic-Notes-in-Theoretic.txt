In earlier research, the authors enhanced the model-based testing environment Spec Explorer to facilitate its use for GUI testing and to tackle certain challenges. This involved developing methods and libraries for modeling GUIs within Spec, creating a tool to automate the mapping between the GUI model and its implementation, and designing a tool to address the issue of test case proliferation by considering the hierarchical structure of GUIs. More comprehensive information can be found in the referenced source. The achieved outcomes have attracted considerable attention from both modelers and testers.
