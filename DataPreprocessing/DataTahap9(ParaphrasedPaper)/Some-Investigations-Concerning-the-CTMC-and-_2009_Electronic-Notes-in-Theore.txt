The language bio-pepa, which has been recently developed, is used for modeling and analyzing biochemical networks. It employs an abstract modeling style that considers discrete levels of concentration within a species rather than individual molecules. This modeling approach is conducive to various analysis techniques, including numerical analysis based on continuous-time Markov chains (CTMC) with states reflecting concentration levels.

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides a brief introduction to bio-pepa and describes the definition of discrete levels and transition rates in the language. Section 3 defines the CTMC with levels. Section 4 describes the mappings from bio-pepa to ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and CTMCs with levels, and Section 5 discusses the relationship between these models. In Section 6, the repressilator model, a genetic network exhibiting oscillating behavior, is used to illustrate and test the approach. Finally, Section 7 presents some conclusions and directions for future work.

The paper's focus is on the application of these concepts to biochemical networks, which are comprised of n species interacting through m reactions in o compartments. The dynamics of a reaction j is described by a kinetic law fj, and the stoichiometric coefficients of the reactions are assumed to be integer and bounded.

Under certain assumptions, it is necessary to impose a maximum level for species that grow infinitely to ensure a finite CTMC when considering creation reactions. Although this introduces an approximation, it is important to consider the implications of this when analyzing the model. In many cases, unbounded networks may have a pragmatic (average) bound value due to the quantitative relations between the molecules and reactions composing the network.

The results in Section 5 demonstrate that, in the limit, the agreement between ODEs and CTMCs with levels derived from a bio-pepa system is complete. However, the relationship between the two models for a given finite h is not explicitly addressed. The paper investigates this relationship between the step size h of the CTMC and the agreement with ODEs. Previous estimates for the probability of convergence between the two models are considered, but they are found to be complex and not useful for choosing h. The paper proposes a measure of distance between the two models and discusses the trade-off between accuracy and tractability with respect to the step size h.

The paper also describes the reactions involved in the transcription, translation, and degradation processes in the biological network. Specifically, it discusses the reactions related to the transcription of three mRNAs with inhibition by one of the proteins (reactions tr1, tr2, tr3), translation of mRNAs into proteins (trl1, trl2, trl3), and degradation of both mRNAs and proteins (di with i= 1,..., 6).
