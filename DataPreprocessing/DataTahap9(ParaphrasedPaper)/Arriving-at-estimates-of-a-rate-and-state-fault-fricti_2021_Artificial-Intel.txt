The critical slip distance in the rate and state model for fault friction, which is crucial for studying potential earthquakes, can vary significantly based on the scale of the critically stressed fault. Therefore, it is important to develop an inversion framework that can accurately estimate the critical slip distance based solely on observed seismogram accelerations. To achieve this, we present a framework that utilizes Bayesian inference and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, and evaluate its performance using synthetic data generated by adding noise to acceleration output from a spring-slider-damper idealization of the rate and state model.

Understanding the factors governing the critical slip distance is fundamental to both seismology and laboratory research, as it can vary from micrometers in observational estimates to several meters in high-velocity laboratory experiments. Addressing the gap between observational and experimental findings is a critical challenge in these communities. To quantify the uncertainty in critical slip distance, we use synthetic earthquake data and focus on the impact of a standard trigonometric perturbation with exponentially decreasing amplitude.

The rate and state model plays a crucial role in forward simulations to assess the seismic impact of fault slip on earthquake activity. However, translating the acceleration field around fault slip activity to seismic recordings on the surface and then back to the fault slip source is a challenging inverse modeling problem. Utilizing a Bayesian framework coupled with MCMC allows us to address this challenge by estimating the acceleration field based on surface measurements.

While subsurface data is not readily available, forward simulations are used to generate data based on computational physics in lieu of real-time measurements. This generated data is then used to inversely estimate the acceleration field from surface observations. Although generating data through forward simulations is not feasible in real-time scenarios, the robustness of the framework lends itself to potential real-time applications. In this work, we focus on estimating critical slip distance using a simplified forward model, but plan to transition to a more complex coupled flow and geomechanics simulator in subsequent studies.
