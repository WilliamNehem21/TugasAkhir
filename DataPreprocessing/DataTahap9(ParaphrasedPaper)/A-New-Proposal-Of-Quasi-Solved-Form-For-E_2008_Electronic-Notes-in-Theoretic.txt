The paper begins with an overview of its structure. It proceeds to introduce notations and preliminary results in the following section. Section 3 presents the concept of quasi-solved form (qsnf), along with its fundamental operations. Section 4 delves into an efficient method for testing satisfiability on qsnfs. Finally, in Section 5, the paper concludes and discusses potential future research directions.

The conjunction of uqcds with a linear characteristic term is analyzed, where linearity ensures that the set uncover returns either an empty or non-empty explicit representation (as per Proposition 4.2). If the explicit representation for a specific auxiliary variable is empty, the test concludes that the given qsnf is unsatisfiable, as there is no feasible assignment for that variable. Otherwise, a non-empty representation is obtained.

In an effort to eliminate more variables, stronger conditions beyond those outlined in Definition 4.7 could be defined. However, analyzing more complex conditions would become as resource-intensive as the call to uncover with all the remaining uqcds. Therefore, the condition in Definition 4.7 is chosen because it is easy to verify and, in most cases, the set of discarded variables is optimal.
