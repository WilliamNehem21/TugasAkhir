Traditional logic gates such as AND gates are not suitable for constructing a reversible computer without an appropriate design approach. This paper presents small building blocks and a more intricate circuit in MOS technology, which are currently beneficial in low-power digital electronics and have potential applications in future quantum computers.

In dual-line hardware, a straightforward implementation of the inverter is achieved by interchanging its two physical lines. Conditional NOT gates, controlled by switches, serve as examples of this concept, with the controlled NOT gate being a primary instance.

Nevertheless, reversible MOS circuits have current utility. They represent a reversible form of pass-transistor topology and are well-suited for adiabatic addressing, where all signals are gradually set to intermediate levels before reaching their final values. This approach has been found to reduce power consumption by approximately a factor of 10 in practical applications.
