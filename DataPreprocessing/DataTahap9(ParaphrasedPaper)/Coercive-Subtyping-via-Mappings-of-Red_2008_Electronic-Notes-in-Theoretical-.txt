This paper presents a new approach to coercion, focusing on the relationship between source and target types without requiring the conversion of values. The approach involves creating a mapping between the computation behaviors of the two types using elimination operators, which allows for the transformation of operations on the target type into operations on the source type. The paper suggests that this approach has several benefits, including making the connections between source and target types explicit, simplifying proofs, and providing a framework for discussing and characterizing different proposed coercions.

The paper introduces the concept of using a two-stage process for coercion, where a coerced term is initially marked and then a mapping process is used to compute on the source value in terms of the target type without converting the source value. The paper also discusses the implications of this approach on inductive families and presents examples of how the new approach can be applied to improve the efficiency of coercion execution.

Furthermore, the paper outlines the potential for further research in terms of the formal metatheory relating to canonicity and convertibility, and discusses the potential implications of subtyping on the notion of canonicity. The paper concludes by highlighting the promising early results and potential extensions of this work, including simpler proofs on functorial coercions and new proofs for coercion combinations involving several distinct types.
