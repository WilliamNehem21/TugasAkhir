This research paper introduces a new nonlinear correlation filter for the localization of facial landmarks. The study demonstrates that support vector machines (SVM) can be employed as a classifier for localization. Additionally, the paper presents the Soft Constrained Minimum Average Correlation Energy filter (SC-MACE), which exhibits greater resistance to overfitting than other variants of correlation filters. To address the performance for multi-mode targets, the paper introduces the Fourier Locally Linear Soft Constraint MACE (FL2 SC-MACE) by incorporating a locally linear framework into the model. The study also outlines a fast implementation and demonstrates that the time taken for testing is not dependent on the number of training samples. The proposed method offers accurate localization performance, generalization capability to object variations, fast testing speed, and robustness to parameter settings. The study includes cross-set eye localization experiments conducted on challenging datasets, such as FRGC, FERET, and BioID, with the proposed method surpassing the state-of-the-art in terms of pixelwise accuracy.

The paper categorizes feature localization approaches into shape-based and statistics-based methods. Shape-based methods perform well for front-facing subjects but may fail for subjects with multiple head poses or distorted features. The paper also discusses the coding of samples and the use of stochastic gradient descent for decision functions. The study highlights that its method is conducted in the spatial domain and offers testing speed independent of the quantity of training samples. Results from validation experiments for eye localization are presented to demonstrate the generalization performance, with the FL2 SC-MACE method outperforming existing approaches by a considerable margin.

In conclusion, the paper introduces the FL2 SC-MACE correlation filter with a soft constraint to mitigate overfitting and a Fourier local linear model to handle multi-mode situations. The study presents cross-set eye localization experiments to confirm the superior performance and efficiency of the proposed method. Furthermore, the authors intend to explore the development of an accurate and fast face alignment algorithm based on FL2 SC-MACE in future work.
