Phylogenetic trees are widely used across various scientific fields to depict the presumed relationships among a set of objects resulting from an evolutionary process, such as biological species, proteins, nucleic acids, languages, chain letters, or medieval manuscripts. In these trees, the objects are denoted as leaves and common ancestors as internal nodes, reflecting the assumed evolutionary connections. However, certain evolutionary events like horizontal gene transfer or hybridization can complicate this representation.

Recently, several algorithms have been proposed for constructing and comparing phylogenetic networks. This paper addresses a scenario where multiple phylogenetic networks are generated to describe the potential evolution of a fixed set of objects using different construction methods or clustering criteria, giving rise to networks that do not fully align due to inherent methodological assumptions or measurement errors. The objective is to identify a subnetwork common to all input networks with as many labeled leaves as feasible, which is likely to represent the genuine evolutionary structure in the data. This can help establish resolved ancestral relationships and highlight objects requiring further investigation.

The paper introduces the concept of a level-f phylogenetic network and presents an algorithm for computing a maximum agreement subnetwork between two level-1 phylogenetic networks in polynomial time. Additionally, it demonstrates that the general case of the maximum agreement phylogenetic subnetwork problem is NP-hard, even when restricted to only three networks. The paper concludes by outlining some open problems for consideration.
