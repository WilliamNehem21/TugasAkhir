India has a high prevalence of oral cancer compared to the rest of the world. It is the most common type of cancer in men and the third most common in women. Unfortunately, oral cancer is often diagnosed at advanced stages in India, leading to low five-year survival rates and presenting a significant public health challenge. Therefore, early detection of oral cancer is crucial.

In the Indian population, the use of bidi and SLT (smokeless tobacco) is well established as contributing factors to oral cancer. Research has shown that bidi smoking poses a higher risk of oral cancer compared to cigarette smoking. Additionally, exposure to both bidi and cigarette smoke on a daily basis increases susceptibility to cancer due to their synergistic effects. Moreover, the condensate from cigarette smoke has been found to promote the expression of certain proteins that contribute to the degradation of collagen, increasing the likelihood of cancer metastasis.

Besides tobacco and betel quid/areca consumption, poor oral health also plays a significant role in the development of oral cancer. Cultural background and age are important factors influencing oral health-related quality of life in the Indian context. It has been observed that younger age groups exhibit a higher proportion of individuals with good dental health, while older people often suffer from tooth loss, dental caries, and periodontal diseases. Moreover, oral health literacy and hygiene practices are linked to socioeconomic status in the Indian population and have an impact on the susceptibility to oral precancers and cancer.

Fuzzy logic, which accommodates uncertain and vague information, is increasingly used to analyze complex systems where conventional computing methods fall short. It allows for the inclusion of imprecise human assessments and linguistic expressions, providing a more accurate representation of complex real-world situations.

In the study conducted in the terrain and Duars region of West Bengal, India, the population consisted of a diverse mix of social communities, including Nepali, Bhutia, Mech, Rajbanshi, Lepcha, Rava, Drupka, and Sherpa. However, the oral health of these cultural groups has not been extensively studied. This multi-ethnic dataset illustrates the unique cultural diversity in this region.
