The paper discusses the financial impact of software failures on users and highlights the lack of insight provided by existing software reliability prediction models in terms of this impact. The authors propose an approach that integrates reliability prediction from the IT perspective with the business perspective, emphasizing the need to consider failure impact during the design stage of software development. The method involves modeling cost-relevant business processes and their associated IT layer, connecting them to failure probabilities, and conducting reliability and cost estimation. The authors illustrate the method with a case study.

The applicability of the proposed method is demonstrated through a case study modeling an industrial maintenance management system. The authors use the Palladio Component Model (PCM) to support their case study, emphasizing its unique consideration of software failures, hardware unavailability, and service usage propagation. The method involves creating a model of the business processes and their links to the IT layer, adding reliability and cost information to determine various forms of cost information.

The authors use the PCM to model the IT layer and calculate the reliability of an IT service invoked from the business layer. The PCM is specifically designed to model component-based software architectures and evaluate their non-functional properties, such as performance and reliability. The method includes utilizing Markov models to determine the probabilities of failure scenarios and calculating the expected costs associated with these scenarios.

The authors emphasize the importance of integrating reliability predictions with financial impact calculations and the need to consider different failure modes and their impact on costs. They also highlight the limitations of their approach and the need for further research to address aspects such as representation of different impact scenarios, consideration of user profiles, and classification of software failure impact.

In summary, the authors present a novel approach that integrates reliability prediction with financial impact calculations, offering insights into the cost implications of software failures for users. They highlight the potential benefits of their approach for comparing design alternatives and optimizing business process steps based on the reliability values of the underlying IT layer. The paper concludes by outlining future work, including the exploration of automated generation of failure scenarios and the incorporation of more sophisticated financial measures into the model.
