This paper explores the probabilistic powerdomain of a stably compact space Xs, which can be considered as arising from a compact ordered space X by modifying its topology to open upper sets. The investigation utilizes the compact ordered space X and traditional tools from measure theory and functional analysis to present both existing and new results in a unified and elegant manner, as summarized in Theorem 5.4.

In the context of denotational semantics, Jones and Plotkin have introduced valuations and the probabilistic powerdomain as replacements for probabilities and the space of probability measures to model probabilistic phenomena in programming. The probabilistic powerdomain has gained increasing attention recently, with most foundational material found in dissertations that are not readily accessible, apart from a basic properties exposition.

To address measures and probabilities for semantics, there is a need to adapt classical concepts of measure, probability, and integration to domains. A domain is defined as a continuous, directed complete, partially ordered set and carries an intrinsic topology known as the Scott topology, which is T0 but not Hausdorff. Valuations, which associate a form of measure with each Scott-open set in a continuous manner, replace measures. The valuations on a domain themselves form a domain referred to as the extended probabilistic powerdomain.

In order to make the paper accessible to readers unfamiliar with domain theory, the exposition is limited to the framework of compact ordered spaces. Classical functional analysis is employed to establish the strong relationship between valuations on the stably compact space (X, G) and the properties of the probabilistic powerdomain over such a space, as well as regular Borel measures and the compact convex set of probability measures on (X, O) in the weak*-topology. These results are particularly applicable to domains that are lawson compact.

While some of the findings in this paper are not novel, credit is given to M. Alvarez Manilla for investigating the close connections between valuations and classical measure theory. The paperâ€™s contribution lies in its straightforward presentation of the results with simple proofs based on standard functional analysis. Acknowledgment is also made to A. Jung for his valuable comments and criticism.
