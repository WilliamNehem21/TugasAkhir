This paper introduces a scheme for optimizing the placement of sink nodes in wireless sensor network (WSN) applications that use backbone-assisted communications. The proposed scheme aims to control energy scavenging and delay constraints by strategically placing the sink nodes. Unlike conventional methods that place base stations at the geographical center or randomly at the edge of the region of interest, the proposed scheme places the base station at the graph theoretical center or centroid of the backbone connecting nodes in the region of interest. This strategy is shown to significantly reduce the number of hops required for packets to reach the sink, leading to improved network performance in terms of delay, load, and energy consumption.

Wireless sensor networks are characterized by low data rates, energy constraints, and a many-to-one communication pattern. Previous research has focused on analyzing network performance using various tree-based topologies such as Steiner trees, shortest path trees, and greedy heuristic-based trees, along with routing protocols and data aggregation methods to optimize energy efficiency, load balancing, and network longevity. The choice of a tree-based backbone for the study is based on existing literature on performance optimality, and various protocols have been examined for energy efficiency and network lifetime improvement. However, previous research has not fully explored the impact of sink placement on network statistics such as delay, load, and energy consumption.

Sink location strategies have been categorized as deterministic or random deployments, with previous studies evaluating the placement of sinks at different positions within the region of interest. The focus has been primarily on reducing the load on the sink without considering delay, or on observing delay using genetic algorithm-based approaches without addressing energy optimization. This paper addresses both energy conservation and reduction in delay by strategically placing sinks in an already connected network.

The study also examines the impact of sink placement on hop counts, network lifespan, and network performance, and compares topology-aware algorithms with geo-aware algorithms and naive center placement strategies. The authors argue that the performance of tree-based communication is improved when the sink is placed at the centroid or graph theoretic center of the tree.

The paper does not propose a specific tree construction algorithm for optimality, but rather focuses on identifying the minimum energy consuming node to serve as the sink in a backbone-assisted network, based on eccentricity and node degrees of the graphs. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their sink placement scheme through theoretical proofs and simulations, and suggest that future work could explore incorporating mobility into the proposed framework.

In conclusion, the proposed sink placement scheme offers improvements in network performance by strategically locating sink nodes in tree-based wireless sensor networks, and it provides a foundation for further research into optimizing sink placement in larger, denser network environments.
