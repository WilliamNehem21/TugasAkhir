The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides a succinct overview of the literature on the various applications of association rule mining (ARM). Section 3 delves into the concept and algorithm linked with ARM. Section 4 outlines the methodological approach employed in this investigation. Section 5 presents the results and discussion, and Section 6 concludes the paper.

An approach that may enhance the ability to diagnose critical medical conditions more effectively is discussed in this paper. Additionally, a programming interface has been introduced for this purpose. The interface offers a novel diagnostic technique founded on association rules and a supervised learning algorithm, aiding in the development of software to provide an approximate prognosis of an illness. The interface is adaptable and can easily accommodate new types of disease symptoms with minimal effort. Gupta et al.

ARM has emerged as a significant mining technique in a variety of health informatics applications. Notably, this paper endeavors to broaden the focus of ARM to recent public health concerns and the impact of physical activity in regulating exercise patterns as part of a strategy for healthy living. The well-documented strong connection between physical activity and health benefits is already widely reported in the literature, with low levels of physical activity being identified as a major contributor to increased health risks.

In this paper, we employ the concept of ARM to elucidate and address the issue of physical activity and exercise patterns. Specifically, we link mild exercise with regular sleeping patterns, expressing confidence that individuals are likely to engage in exercise before bedtime. Our proposal suggests incorporating mild exercise just before sleep, with the specific type of exercise left to individual choice. To ensure that it does not disrupt the sleep routine, we recommend engaging in light exercise. The subsequent section outlines the experimental evaluation of this study, utilizing the ARM concept.
