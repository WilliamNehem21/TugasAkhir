This paper investigates the decidability of reachability, normalisation, and neededness in n-growing and n-shallow term rewriting systems (TRSs). In an n-growing TRS, a variable must be at depth n on the left-hand side and at a depth greater than n on the right-hand side if it occurs on both sides of a rewrite rule. In an n-shallow TRS, a variable must be at depth n on both sides if it occurs on both sides of a rewrite rule.

We introduce n-growing and n-shallow TRSs to explore the decidability of reachability, normalisation, and neededness. These TRSs are extensions of the growing and shallow TRSs introduced by Jacquemard and Comon. While reachability, normalisation, and (in the orthogonal case) neededness are decidable for growing and shallow TRSs, we demonstrate that this is not the case for our generalisations.

We demonstrate that neededness is decidable for orthogonal growing TRSs. Since every 1-growing TRS is growing, we also establish the decidability of reachability, normalisation, and (in the orthogonal case) neededness for 1-growing TRSs. However, we show that these results do not extend to n-growing TRSs with n > 1.

Furthermore, we prove that neededness is decidable for orthogonal shallow TRSs. Since every 1-shallow TRS is shallow, we also establish the decidability of reachability, normalisation, and (in the orthogonal case) neededness for 1-shallow TRSs. However, we show that these results do not generalize to n-shallow TRSs with n > 1.
