In a typical process for synthesizing graphite oxide, a combination of 96 ml concentrated H2SO4 and 10.7 ml concentrated H3PO4 at a 9:1 volume ratio was prepared. This acid mixture was then slowly added to a beaker containing 0.6 g of graphite powder and 4.8 g of potassium permanganate (mixed at a 1:8 ratio) while stirring with a glass rod.

The epoxy groups in graphite oxide (GO) are susceptible to attack by nucleophilic reagents, leading to a nucleophilic substitution reaction that opens the epoxy rings. It is hypothesized that ascorbic acid serves as a proton and electron donor to graphene oxide, facilitating the opening of the epoxide rings and their conversion into easily removable leaving groups (OH), which subsequently dehydrate, leaving behind a graphene sheet. To eliminate the OH groups, it is suggested that ascorbic acid donates a proton to the OH group, leading to its final dehydration.

The degree of oxidation in GO was evaluated, and it was observed that the intensity at around 300 nm for GO4 is relatively lower compared to GO3, implying that an excess of potassium permanganate can lead to over-oxidation of graphite. To investigate the impact of reaction temperature on the degree of oxidation, two samples (GO4 and GO5) were studied, with a fixed graphite powder to KMnO4 ratio of 1:8.
