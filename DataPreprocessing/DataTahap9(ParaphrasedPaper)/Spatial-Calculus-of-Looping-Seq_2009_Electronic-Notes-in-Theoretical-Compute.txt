The primary objective of spatial calculus (SC) is to provide a more precise representation of biological processes that are influenced by the specific positioning of elements. This level of accuracy is particularly beneficial for cell biology, where there is often significant spatial organization and non-uniform distribution of molecular species. These detailed descriptions can then be used to simulate the system, allowing for a faithful representation of its evolution. As examples of applications of this calculus, we present a model of cell proliferation and a model of the quorum sensing process in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The results of the simulation of the former model are demonstrated using a specially designed simulator.

SC incorporates the capability to model stochastic motions, such as brownian motion, and it can be extended to incorporate pseudo-random motion (which is still deterministic) by introducing an additional parameter for movement functions. This parameter serves as a seed to initialize the pseudo-random behavior, analogous to the initialization of a pseudo-random number generator. Although the extension of the calculus cannot be fully presented in this space, we assume its availability in the provided examples.

The function "spacecheck" takes the radius "r" of the looping sequence, and spatial descriptions of the elements inside it (i2) and on the brane (i1) as parameters. It utilizes this information to approximately determine if there is sufficient space for all the elements. While the simplest definition of the function is a constant function that always returns "tt", more accurate definitions can be utilized if necessary.

Rearrangement is achieved using the "arrange" algorithm (detailed in section 3.2), which may fail to produce a well-formed term. In cases where the rearrangement fails after the phase of movement, the elements are not moved for the current step. Before defining the semantics, several auxiliary definitions need to be introduced.

The approach described in the paper is one way to resolve space conflicts among the elements of a system. However, other methods could also be employed, such as representing the elements as points if they do not occupy any space, or allowing the application of a rule only if it does not create a conflict. Nonetheless, these alternative methods may limit the modeling capacity of the calculus in certain scenarios.

In the context of quorum sensing, the spatial SC model provides a more accurate representation compared to other stochastic models, as it accounts for the non-homogeneous distribution of autoinducer proteins outside the bacteria. This is particularly significant when the speed of reactions is significantly faster than diffusion rates.
