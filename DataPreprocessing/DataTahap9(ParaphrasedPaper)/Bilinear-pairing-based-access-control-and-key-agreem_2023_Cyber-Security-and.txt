In this research paper, the primary focus is on the development of an access control mechanism within an in-vehicle network environment. The access control scheme is designed to ensure a secure environment for providing uninterrupted services within the dynamic network of in-vehicle communication. Due to the constantly changing location of vehicles and increasing population leading to a higher number of registered vehicles, there is a need for an access control scheme that can authenticate and authorize members joining the network, while also safeguarding against potential malicious activities from adversaries. The success of the access control mechanism is essential for regulating the flow of false, invalid, illegal, and unauthorized information within the network, managing access permissions, overseeing the scalable in-vehicle communication architecture, handling large data streams, and monitoring resource allocation and utilization in the network.

The paper also introduces an authentication-based secure data dissemination protocol and framework for 5G-enabled vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs). The proposed scheme involves mutual authentication between vehicles, followed by computation of a session key using cryptographic techniques and pre-loaded information for secure communication. Additionally, the scheme features a password update phase, allowing vehicles to change passwords in the event of theft or breach. The security of the scheme is evaluated informally and formally using the Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool to demonstrate its resilience against various well-known attacks. Furthermore, a comprehensive performance analysis compares the proposed scheme with existing ones in terms of computation and communication costs, highlighting its superiority in security and functionality features.
