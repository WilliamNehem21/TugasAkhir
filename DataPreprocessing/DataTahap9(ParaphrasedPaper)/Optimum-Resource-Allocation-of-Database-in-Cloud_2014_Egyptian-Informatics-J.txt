The calibration procedure within the virtual design advisor (VDA) was previously carried out manually, and this manual process was considered complex and time-consuming due to the need for repetition when the database management system (DBMS) ran on a different server infrastructure or was replaced on the same server. This paper introduces an automatic calibration tool (ACT) to automate the calibration process.

Cloud computing represents a new era of computing, where users can access computational resources and data center services over the network for deploying and developing applications. The key aspect of cloud computing is its self-service provision.

The paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 presents related works, Section 3 describes the calibration problem within the VDA, Section 4 discusses the proposed automatic calibration tool for DBMS query optimizer, Section 5 addresses the optimization problem within the VDA, Section 6 discusses the proposed GPSO algorithm, Section 7 introduces the evaluation results of ACT and the GPSO algorithm, and Section 8 concludes the paper and provides a brief outlook on future work.

The VDA utilizes a white-box approach to model the DBMS performance, while a black-box approach is used in an adaptive resource control system for dynamically adjusting resource shares of multi-tier applications within a virtualized data center.

An example is provided to illustrate resource allocation for virtual machines (VMs), and various particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms are discussed for addressing dynamic environments.

The paper also details the functionalities of the worker module in the ACT, the experimental setup using PostgreSQL and Xen-based para-virtualization, and the potential applications of the GPSO algorithm in resource allocation for incoming workloads within a cloud computing environment.

In summary, the paper presents the implementation of an automatic calibration tool to streamline the calibration process for DBMS, as well as the utilization of the GPSO algorithm for dynamic resource allocation in cloud computing environments.
