The dynamic clustering sensor approach presented in this study aims to create clusters that adapt to the movement of the target. Unlike static clustering, where a node remains within a single cluster, dynamic clustering allows nodes to be members of different clusters at different times. By forming clusters based on the movement of the target, only one cluster is active at each time, reducing energy consumption. This dynamic approach is more reliable than static clustering and also reduces the sensing and forwarding of redundant information by sensor nodes. The authors assert that dynamic cluster-based approaches offer improved bandwidth utilization and higher scalability compared to other methods for target tracking.

Hybrid solutions, which integrate various approaches, are also explored in the literature. For example, one study proposes a predictive mechanism, such as a Markov chain, implemented within a clustered network to address the tradeoff between tracking performance and energy consumption. Additionally, other researchers have proposed a dynamic clustering algorithm combined with the Kalman filter to predict the position of a single moving target.

Virtual force algorithms (VFA) have gained popularity for addressing node coverage and deployment issues. In one study, a virtual force-directed co-evolutionary particle swarm optimization (VFCPSO) algorithm is proposed to maximize sensing coverage while minimizing energy consumption in a hybrid wireless sensor network comprising static and mobile sensors.

Furthermore, a genetic algorithm is presented to address coverage holes in the network by determining the minimum number and optimal locations of additional mobile nodes required after the initial deployment of fixed nodes. The performance of the genetic algorithm is evaluated using several indicators, demonstrating its effectiveness in optimizing network coverage.

The concept of percolation theory, which deals with random variations in the degree of connectivity within disordered media, is also discussed. The theory is used to define a percolation threshold, which indicates the point at which a system becomes interconnected. The authors emphasize the contrast between percolation as a probabilistic value in relation to time and tracking accuracy as a measure related to tracking space. Additionally, the article proposes a dynamic clustering algorithm for target tracking and introduces the concept of target percolation as a key performance criterion, aiming to balance target percolation, tracking precision, and energy consumption.

In terms of future work, the authors plan to adapt the proposed algorithm to accommodate environments with multiple targets and evaluate the performance of monitoring algorithms using the recently introduced percolation metric in collaboration with other researchers.
