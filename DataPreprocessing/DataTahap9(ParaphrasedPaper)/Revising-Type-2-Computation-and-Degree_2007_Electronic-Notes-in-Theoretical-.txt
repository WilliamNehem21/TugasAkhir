A critical but often overlooked aspect of the definition of a type-2 machine is the requirement that its output tape operate in a one-way manner, as noted in [21, top of p.15]. This characteristic enables the early termination of a real number computation once the desired level of precision is achieved, as there is assurance that the initial approximation will not be reversed. Additionally, this condition is essential for the validity of the main theorem.
