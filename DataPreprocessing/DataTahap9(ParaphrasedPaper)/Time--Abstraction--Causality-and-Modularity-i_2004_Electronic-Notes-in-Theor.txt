The concept of causality is closely associated with a time model, and there are essentially two distinct time models: discrete (digital) time and continuous (analog) time. The critical question for system models revolves around the nature of time.

For input/output information processing devices, the notion of causality is crucial as certain outputs are causally dependent on certain inputs. Causality signifies the interdependence between the actions involved in information exchange within a system. Interface behaviors represent relationships through set-valued functions. This paper introduces and discusses the concept of causality for interface behaviors.

Interface behaviors produce output and consume input within a specific time frame, characterizing the causal relationship between input and output. Output dependent on specific input cannot be generated before receiving the input. However, proper timing allows for instantaneous reaction, wherein the output at time t may depend on the input at time t. This can lead to causality issues when considering delay-free feedback loops. Strengthening the concept of proper time flow to the notion of causality helps avoid these issues.

Without the full notion of causality in the interface abstraction of a component, it becomes challenging to determine which events will definitely happen, which events will occur in response to others, and which events will not happen due to causality properties. This may make it impossible to exclude behaviors that represent so-called causal loops and are hence operationally impossible. Additionally, deadlock properties cannot be accurately deduced from the interface abstraction of system components.

Coarsening the time scale for a component by a factor of n is a form of abstraction, which may introduce nondeterminism and underspecification due to the coarser time scale. Loss of causality information due to time coarsening is a particular concern.

A special case is eliminating all time information. If a component's output depends on the timing of the input, behavior generated by full time abstraction exhibits a high level of nondeterminism. However, if the output produced is only dependent on the values and order of arrival of the input messages, the behavior generated by full time abstraction is more deterministic, albeit at the cost of potentially losing causality information.

Strong causality offers several advantages as it makes reasoning about systems more concrete and straightforward. It is particularly easy to handle feedback loops using fixpoints for strongly causal behaviors, as time guardedness guarantees unique fixpoints for deterministic functions. In essence, all fixpoints are causal under strong causality.
