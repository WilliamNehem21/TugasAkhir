This academic paper introduces a visual specification language called Visual Coordination Diagrams (VCD) for the high-level design of concurrent systems with heterogeneous coordination models. This language focuses on separating behavioral aspects from coordination aspects and allows for the incorporation of different coordination models and formalisms. The paper provides an overview of VCD, its formal definition, and an example of its usage.

VCD employs a coordination model that separates coordination and behavioral aspects, which is referred to as an "exogenous model". It can also be viewed as static architecture diagrams specifying connections among components. VCD possesses two levels of heterogeneity, allowing for the combination of different coordination models and the incorporation of various formalisms for specifying behavioral aspects.

The paper compares VCD with other similar languages, such as Graphical Calculus of Communicating Systems (GCCS), Synchronous GCCS, and Architectural Interaction Diagrams (AID), highlighting the differences in their underlying semantic models and support for heterogeneity at both coordination and behavioral layers.

Additionally, the paper discusses the semantics of VCD, which is based on a state transition model, as well as the key construct of the coordination layer, which is a bus representing coordination mechanisms. It outlines how VCD enables the specification of coordination of components in a network and defines the semantics of VCD networks.

Overall, the paper presents VCD as a visual formalism for the higher-level design of concurrent systems, emphasizing its capability to support heterogeneity in coordination and behavioral aspects.
