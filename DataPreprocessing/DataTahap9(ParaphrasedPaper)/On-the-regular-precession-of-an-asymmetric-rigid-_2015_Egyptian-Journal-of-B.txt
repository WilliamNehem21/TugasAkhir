The dynamical condition indicates that the motion is only integrable when the body's angular momentum remains permanently in a horizontal plane. Furthermore, in such cases, the conditional complementary integral is represented by a cubic polynomial in the angular velocities, and its explicit solution is expressed in terms of ultra-elliptic functions of time.

A significant generalization of the aforementioned problem pertains to the motion of a rigid body influenced by a combination of two uniform fields, characterized by constant vectors representing gravity and magnetic fields in space, as well as vectors for the body's center of mass and magnetic moment. The potential for this problem is a linear function of the direction cosines for both fields with respect to the body frame.

Despite its practical significance, the problem of a rigid body in motion under the influence of multiple uniform fields has long been overlooked. Integrable instances of this problem are still uncommon despite its structural richness. To date, none of the previously established results concerning the properties of solutions in the complex plane of time or the existence of algebraic integrals can be extended to encompass this particular problem. The research on this problem lacks systematic exploration, and only isolated results exist.

Motion of this nature commonly occurs for an axi-symmetric heavy body in a single uniform gravity field (Lagrange's top), with the precession axis positioned vertically. However, as first observed by Grioli in 1947, such motion is also feasible for an asymmetric (triaxial) body in a single uniform gravity field, where the precession axis is inclined to the vertical at an angle dependent on the moments of inertia.

In an effort to clarify the body's motion with respect to the space axes, the gravity field is aligned in the negative direction of the x-axis, with the positive half of the x-axis pointing vertically upwards. The y-axis is horizontal and aligned with the direction of the magnetic field, while the z-axis is orthogonal to it in the horizontal plane.
