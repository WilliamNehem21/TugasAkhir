The initial example in our definition corresponds precisely to the analogous one outlined in the referenced work, and it plays a vital role in our demonstrations when working with 'bf.' Additionally, the subsequent example extends the related case in the same publication, but now considers the specificities introduced in the new fuzzy context by comparable terms. This latter example will be utilized when examining 'bv' and 'bc' scenarios, as will be demonstrated in the subsequent proof of our inaugural theorem.
