The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives an overview of related work, highlighting various Bluetooth routing protocols. Section 3 provides a detailed presentation of the proposed Bluetooth scatternet route optimization protocol, while Section 4 discusses the simulation results. Finally, the conclusion is presented in Section 5.

Although numerous routing protocols for mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) have been developed, they are not directly applicable to Bluetooth networks due to differences in bandwidth and MAC layer features. Ad hoc routing protocols need to be combined with scatternet formation functionalities. When applying ad hoc network protocols to scatternets, it is essential to consider ad hoc routing algorithms for establishing a new scatternet. Routing schemes need to be utilized by the scatternet to find routing paths.

Traditional ad hoc routing protocols can be employed for Bluetooth networks. The initial attempt at routing in a Bluetooth network was introduced by Bhagwat, who proposed the routing vector method. The enhanced AODV routing protocol for a Bluetooth network serves as a fundamental protocol for scatternet communication, improving the main route discovery process of AODV. This protocol employs two types of routing throughout the simulation.

In the simulation, fifty Bluetooth devices were distributed in a 70m x 70m area. Constant bit rate (CBR) traffic was utilized for representing the application. A total of fifty devices were used, with numbers varying from fifteen to fifty. Eighteen pairs of source and destination were employed, and the round robin (RR) scheduling algorithm was utilized. The data packet types DH3 and DH5 were used, and the entire simulation execution lasted for 200 seconds.
