While this is a pervasive characteristic in the formation of computably enumerable (c.e.) degrees, and seems inevitable in the cone avoidance strategy, we managed to demonstrate, through a combination of this construction and established techniques from the theory of promptly simple degrees (specifically, utilizing the recursion theorem to initiate prompt diagonalizations), that there exists an almost everywhere (a.e.) dominating c.e. degree outside any upper cone of promptly simple degrees. This is the main theorem of our paper.

The construction involves a tree argument in which level 3e is associated with the backing strategy me, levels 3n+1 are assigned alternately to domination and minimal pair strategies (for example, 3(2e)+1 is linked with de and 3(2e+1)+1 is linked with qe), and level 3e+2 is linked with pe.
