The concept of high-level replacement (HLR) systems involves establishing a collection of rewrite rules, each comprised of a pattern that must be matched and a corresponding template that outlines the modifications to be carried out within the system. Additional application conditions may further restrict the transformation. An important advantage of this rewriting approach is the ability to abstractly specify the circumstances under which a system should be altered, as well as any potential dependencies that require updating. Furthermore, these rules can be applied not only at a local level but also globally, with a brief introduction to their dynamic aspects.

The reo coordination language involves the use of connectors to coordinate components from an external perspective, where the components are not aware that they are being coordinated. The more complex connectors are constructed from primitive ones, referred to as channels, which possess well-defined behavior as defined by users. To create larger connectors, these channels can be aggregated into nodes and arranged in a circuit. Each channel type imposes specific constraints on the potential flow of data at its endpoints, such as synchrony or mutual exclusion. The endpoints can either be source ends, accepting data into the channel, or sink ends, producing data out of the channel. While the behavior of channels is user-defined, the nodes are fixed in their routing constraints. At a node, data flow occurs only if the sink end is ready to accept data. Other types of channels such as lossysync and fifo1 exhibit unique behaviors as well.

The reo system also provides various operations for altering the topology of a connector at runtime, enabling dynamic creation of channels, splitting and joining of nodes, and the ability to hide internal nodes, thereby freezing the connector's topology. This allows it to be utilized solely from an external standpoint with its published interface, without any further changes to its internal structure.

In order to define complex transformations within this context, the theory of High-Level Replacement (HLR) systems, which is an extension of the theory of graph transformation to other high-level structures, serves as the basis for our approach. This theory is applied to the field of coordination to conveniently define transformations for reo connectors.

The paper also discusses the interpretation of productions as rewrite rules, each consisting of a left-hand side (LHS) and a right-hand side (RHS) along with the gluing object. The process of applying a rewrite rule involves determining which parts of the matched pattern should be deleted and which new parts should be added, as well as utilizing a categorical construction known as double-pushout (DPO) derivations.

In addition, the paper highlights the importance of high-level replacement categories in defining a set of axioms, referred to as HLR-conditions, to facilitate DPO-rewriting while ensuring various useful properties and theorems. The glueing condition and the preservation of information by morphisms and typed rewrite rules are also discussed.

The examples presented in the paper emphasize the significance of robust tool support for applications in the field of coordination. The Eclipse Coordination Tools (ECT) project aims to consolidate existing reo-related tools into an integrated environment, thereby facilitating coordination tasks. The paper also discusses the use of the Tiger EMF Model Transformation Framework (EMT) as an implementation of the graph-based HLR transformation approach, and describes future work involving the integration of the transformation framework with the reo implementation to facilitate runtime libraries.
