The objective of this study is to extend the findings on parallelism and concurrency in adhesive high-level replacement (HLR) systems to adhesive HLR systems with negative application conditions (NACs). These conditions specify that a particular structure must not be present before or after the application of a rule to a given context. The presence of NACs significantly impacts the properties of the replacement system and influences each rule application or transformation. The study describes the impact of NACs on parallelism and concurrency in the replacement system by generalizing results that were previously formulated for adhesive HLR systems without negative application conditions, including the local Church-Rosser theorem, parallelism theorem, and concurrency theorem. These generalized results are important for the development of formal analysis techniques for adhesive HLR systems with NACs.

The paper introduces adhesive HLR systems with NACs, which are crucial for modeling transformation systems and enhance the expressiveness of the transformations by expressing the absence of certain structures during the transformation. To provide a comprehensive theory for such transformations with NACs, they are integrated into the framework of adhesive HLR systems, necessitating the definition of new morphism classes for successful adaptation of the theory.

The study emphasizes that adhesive HLR systems are based on either adhesive HLR or weak adhesive HLR categories, with the latter differing only slightly in the van Kampen square property. For the purposes of the paper, adhesive HLR categories are considered, with the integration of NACs. It is noted, however, that all results formulated in the paper are also applicable to weak adhesive HLR categories with NACs, such as those for Petri net transformations.

In an adhesive HLR category with NACs, additional properties on the special morphism classes in the category are required to generalize all results. Three classes of morphisms (m, m', and q), and a class of pairs of morphisms (e') are distinguished. These classes should have specific properties described in the paper.

The study presents results on parallelism and concurrency in the context of algebraic graph transformation to extend these concepts to transformations with negative application conditions. Specifically, it establishes the local Church-Rosser theorem, parallelism theorem, and concurrency theorem for transformations with NACs. These results, which are formulated in the context of the adhesive high-level replacement framework with an additional necessary morphism class (q), are applicable to all transformation systems with NACs that fit into the adhesive HLR framework. Furthermore, these results provide a basis for the extension of other notions, such as embedding and local confluence, for adhesive HLR systems with NACs. The paper also highlights the need for future work to refine and assess the applicability of the new results and to develop efficient analysis algorithms for transformations with NACs.
