Recently, a new game called the maker-breaker domination game was introduced, which is played on a graph G by two players called dominator and staller. These names were chosen to highlight the nature of domination in the game and to align with the standard terminology used for domination games. In this game, the players take turns selecting a vertex of G that has not yet been chosen. Dominator wins if the vertices he has chosen at some point form a dominating set, while staller wins if dominator is unable to form a dominating set. Notably, the maker-breaker domination game is a maker-breaker game, and it can be shown that dominator wins the game on G if and only if maker wins the corresponding game on a hypergraph derived from G. 

The residual graph, denoted as r(G), of a graph G is defined as the graph obtained from G by iteratively removing pendant paths P2 until no such path is present. A pendant P2 is a path attached to G with an edge, and when removed, it entails the removal of two vertices and two edges. Additionally, if G = P2, it can also be removed to obtain an empty graph.

Using Lemma 3.2(i), it can be shown that a graph H has a perfect matching and is a forest. Playing the s-game on G, staller employs a strategy in which she plays on each tree of H and plays last on the vertex of this tree adjacent to r(G), forcing dominator to respond on the matching. As a result, dominator makes at least n(H) moves on H. Furthermore, staller plays on vertices adjacent to r(G), ensuring that no vertex in r(G) will be dominated by the time staller makes her first move in r(G).

In conclusion, the maker-breaker domination number of cycles is determined, which is found to be less complex than initially expected based on prior research on the total domination game.

It can be easily demonstrated using Lemma 1.1 and Fact 1.2 that dominator has a winning strategy on even cycles. Notably, dominator cannot achieve better results than these strategies.
