"Formal concept analysis" was pioneered by Rudolf Wille, Bernard Ganter, and their colleagues at Darmstadt. Their approach focuses on constructing and visually representing concept lattices, which are partially ordered sets of concepts. The nodes of the concept lattice correspond to abstract concepts of the phenomenon being modeled, and the relationships within the lattice reflect relationships in the external world. Their work has been documented in a book with numerous examples, and their method has been applied in industrial contexts (as reported by Ganter and Wille) as well as in code re-engineering [8, 14].

In the case where the universe of attributes is denoted as A = {a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h} and is the lattice supremum, the lattice is oriented with respect to A, and the singleton set {f, a, g}, which is an attribute of every object, serves as the lattice infimum. The lattice is partially ordered with respect to set inclusion.

An operator is considered a closure operator if it satisfies certain properties, such as closure under self, monotonicity, and idempotence. The Galois closure on binary relations is a type of discrete closure operator. A more comprehensive treatment of closure spaces has been presented in previous work. A key concept in this area is that of the generators of a closed set, denoted as z:, referring to a minimal set y such that y:' = z. For instance, in the case of a convex hull closure operator, the generators of a convex n-gon are its n vertices (or extreme points). An n-gon is uniquely determined by its generators, leading to the notion of a closure operator being uniquely generated and resulting in a closure space called an antimatroid. While much of the closure literature assumes antimatroid closure, the closure spaces derived from concept analysis do not necessarily follow this pattern, yet they retain many structural properties of antimatroid closure spaces.

Using concepts from closure spaces, it is possible to generate the concept lattice while simultaneously determining the generators of these closed concepts. The addition of a new object and its attributes to the lattice prompts a transformation in the lattice structure, reflecting the essence of discrete, empirical induction. This transformation is inherently graceful and local in nature due to the property of closed sets, in which the intersection of closed sets must also be closed. This leads to an intriguing interplay between closed sets and their generators.

Whenever a new row of observations is added, at least one new closed set is introduced to the lattice structure, as the attributes of a single row form a closed set. If the new row object is already part of an existing closed set, the lattice remains unchanged; otherwise, the generation structure of the lattice is altered. This modification also impacts the interaction between the new object and the existing elements in the lattice.

This process of observing new data and its impact on the lattice structure is further illustrated through specific examples, emphasizing the dynamics of adding new elements and their subsequent influence on the lattice structure.

In conclusion, the observed phenomena and the addition of new data showcase the dynamic nature of concept lattices and the interplay between closed sets and their generators within the lattice structure. Also, conjectures regarding the behavior of deletion within concept lattices are discussed, but have yet to be proven.
