The paper presents a method for generating a binary-tree topology and placing routers based on the communication profile of system-on-chip (SoC) designs. By using an elastic-flow approach, the need for large router buffers is eliminated, leading to significant power and space savings compared to traditional network-on-chip (NoC) architectures. The resulting network is deadlock-free, and communication latencies are bounded. As system-on-chip designs become more complex, with multiple clock domains and integrated intellectual property components, NoCs offer a solution to the increasing communication complexity. The paper introduces an asynchronous NoC using an elastic channel protocol and outlines a workflow for automatic network topology generation and router placement. The use of heuristic algorithms and communication characterization drives the topology generation, router placement, and link bandwidth matching. The paper is organized into sections describing novel network components, an elastic-channel protocol, analysis for synthesizing an efficient network, algorithms for determining routing topology and network component placement, and a conclusion. The network fabric is based on latency insensitive protocols, and the physical placement of network routers is deemed crucial for minimizing latency on critical communication paths. A force-directed method modified for router placement is utilized to determine router locations. The input to this algorithm includes a communication-traffic graph (CTG), network topology, and IP block layout. Overall, the paper contributes to the advancement of elastic network-on-chip design and provides insights into automatic network synthesis for complex system-on-chip designs.
