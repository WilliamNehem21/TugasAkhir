The skin is considered healthy when it is smooth, elastic, and has well-arranged hair, along with normal sebum. It exhibits a range of colors from pink to light brown, while the eyes are clear and secretion-free. The oral mucosa shows a normal color and saliva, and the nose is moist without any discharge. Limbs are strong, and joints do not display redness, swelling, or inflammation.

In this research, a modular assembly device was developed, and a short-distance star communication network was constructed. It is controlled by a central control module, with each submodule having an independent control unit responsible for circuit control within the module. Physical combination of submodules forms a sorting module consisting of at least one inlet, one detection, and several outlet modules. Moreover, soft material connectors are utilized to construct pig passages with acoustic and optical devices to repel pigs and minimize human intervention. Pigs can automatically undergo the sorting process when guided by sound and light devices through designated passages.

The sorting process involves two parts. Firstly, health detection is performed using collected images of pigs. Weight and visual information are combined with a pre-trained binary classification model for decision-level fusion to determine whether pigs are abnormal or sick. Sick pigs are sorted into isolation pens for workers to assess and treat. A fusion of image neural network and weight-based classification results is used to enhance experiment accuracy. The identification of pigs and their weight measurement is utilized for sorting, in which historical data is combined with new data to assess the pig's growth and health status. Furthermore, image recognition is employed to detect possible diseases in pig phenotypes, sorting them into a designated pen if a disease or abnormal weight is detected.

Simulation tests were conducted to analyze and evaluate the experiments, wherein typical waveform graphs representing irregular motion were collected. The study utilized different sets of data points between 20 and 100 kg to compare average and Kalman filtering errors.

Deeper CNNs are employed post application of the Visual Geometry Group (VGG) model. However, an increase in network depth can lead to issues such as exploding or vanishing gradients, resulting in convergence problems. To address this, the ResNet model is proposed, allowing for deeper network architectures. ResNet retains original information by feeding a portion of input data directly to the output without passing through the entire convolutional network. This structure facilitates the addition of deeper convolutional layers to enhance model performance.

In the experiment, pig identification was performed using a pre-trained ResNet-50-based model on the ImageNet dataset. The model's convolutional layer was frozen after pre-training on the ImageNet dataset, and the parameters of the fully connected layer were retrained to enhance network accuracy. The captured images were classified and saved for filtering and cropping, with 6000 images used as the training set, 2000 images as the validation set, and 2000 images as the test dataset.

Kappa, a statistical coefficient, was used for the evaluation of results, indicating the consistency of predicted values with actual values. This study designed a low-cost livestock-sorting system based on deep learning. The proposed system accomplishes functions such as livestock ID recognition, automated livestock sorting, disease detection, and data tracking and prediction, solely using weights and images as inputs.

However, the generalizability of the model to different livestock requires further investigation due to data collection and tagging costs, as well as the need for a more robust and transferable model. Collaboration with the veterinary field is necessary for the classification and detection of diseases, and future research should focus on diseases related to livestock pathology and multi-information fusion detection. Furthermore, collaboration with animal husbandry and veterinary institutes for research on livestock pathogenesis is anticipated, along with data collection on other livestock breeds to enhance sorting information management systems.
