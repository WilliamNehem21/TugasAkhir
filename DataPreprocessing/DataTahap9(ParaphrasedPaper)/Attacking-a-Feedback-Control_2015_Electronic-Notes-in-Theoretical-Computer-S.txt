A control system comprises sensors, controllers, and actuators. Sensors collect information about the system's condition, which controllers utilize to compute an appropriate control action. Actuators execute the control action, inducing a change in system state that is then detected by the sensors in the subsequent cycle. In a feedback system, controllers depend on sensors to provide high-quality data, ensuring correct and safe system operation, even in uncertain environments.

The expanding attack surface makes it increasingly feasible to counterfeit sensors and introduce false data into the system. Instances of GPS spoofing attacks on unmanned aerial vehicles and vulnerabilities in modern automobiles demonstrate the various avenues attackers can exploit. Given the growing interconnectedness of systems and extensive communication with other devices, eliminating attack vectors presents a considerable challenge.

As interest in studying control systems and cyberphysical systems under adversarial attack grows, significant work has focused on attack-resilient state estimation. If the correct state can be determined despite an attack, the rest of the system can continue to function as usual. For linear systems, solving the state estimation problem in the presence of attacks can be framed as an optimization problem. Researchers have investigated the potential impacts of stealth attacks and have outlined methods for safety runtime monitoring and noise tolerance to mitigate the effects of attacks.

It is essential to consider the potential effects of various stealth and attack time settings and analyze system behavior under different conditions. Additionally, the experimental data in Section 3 was generated using a two-step verification process supported by hybridsal. This process involves abstracting the model to an infinite-state discrete state transition system and subsequently model-checking the abstract model.

The choice of the sensor under attack is determined to be insignificant for the obtained results, with the outcomes being essentially the same regardless of which sensor is compromised. Furthermore, the study can be extended to encompass more general hybrid dynamical systems beyond the scope of the current investigation.
