Similarly, a single axiom is used to define the static or non-deterministic aspect of the semantics, resulting in a greater number of constraint choices and thereby yielding multiple semantics within the same simulation part. The unifying framework is achieved by utilizing two conveniently parametrized basic axioms to encompass all classic semantics within the spectrum, as well as others.

The reduction of non-determinism, as demonstrated in the initial portion of our study focused on observational semantics, has clarified the categorization into branching and linear semantics. Additionally, the commonalities shared by all semantics have been uncovered, allowing for a comprehensive study without the necessity of employing case analysis proofs.
