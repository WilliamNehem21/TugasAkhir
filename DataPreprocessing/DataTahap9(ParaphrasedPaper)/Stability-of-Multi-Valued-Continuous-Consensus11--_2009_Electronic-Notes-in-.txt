The formalization presented in Section 2 of the academic paper details a continuous consensus system and its stability measures, independent of any specific model of computation. The study considers memoryless systems with independent one-shot consensus executions and compares their stability to systems that retain memory of previous executions. Additionally, the paper investigates the stability of symmetric systems, where decisions are made based solely on the distribution of input values rather than the specific source of those values. The characterization of system stability takes into account memory and symmetry properties, establishing both upper and lower bounds for various scenarios.

The remaining sections of the paper are organized as follows: Section 3 addresses systems with memory, while Section 4 discusses memoryless systems.

In Section 3.1, the paper explores the instability of a system with the minimum number of processors, n, and demonstrates that for sufficiently large n, the instability equals 1. Section 3.2 considers the case of a general n. Subsequently, in Section 4, the paper investigates a system that lacks the ability to retain memory from previous input vectors and decisions.

When n is at its minimum (i.e., n = vt + 1 for ev systems as demonstrated in Lemma 2.4 and 2t + 1 for rv systems as demonstrated in Lemma 2.5), it is proven that the system's instability in this scenario is n, which implies that any system can be compelled to change its decision with each input change.

The paper observes that when n is minimal, specifically when n = vt + 1, the number of decision changes cannot be reduced; it is feasible to force any ev system D to alter its decision with each input change. Conversely, when n is large, the paper shows in Lemma 3.4 that a system can be constructed to change its decision only once.
