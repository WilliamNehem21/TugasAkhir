However, even though the definition of subtype{x| e} includes the term e, we insist (as per the current formulation of the theory) that it be constructed in the empty (global) context, i.e., without any free variables. The syntax of dependent type theories is highly complex, which further complicates the matter.

While the form of this result is quite familiar, its practical utility is rather limited, as it only pertains to open subspaces. Ultimately, Corollary 10.12 will establish an induction scheme stating that any subspace that contains nil and is closed under:: constitutes the entire space. The principle that we shall repeatedly employ in Section 6 is as follows.

Regrettably, there is a crucial omission: we are not yet able to demonstrate the admissibility of l1+ l2 when l1 and l2 are admissible. This is due to the fact that if l1: x(n) and l2: x(m), we would expect l1+ l2: x(n+m), whereas our current method of induction only takes us from n to n+1. We will demonstrate that+ is well-defined in Lemma 10.9 by utilizing the recursion scheme for nil and::, but that lies ahead in our progress.
