In a threshold public key encryption scheme, a message is encrypted and sent to a group of recipients in such a way that at least a specified number of them (referred to as the threshold) must cooperate in order to decrypt the original message. This type of scheme is commonly used in scenarios where it is desired to prevent any single party from having complete control or responsibility over sensitive information. The standard strategy for implementing this concept involves an interactive setup protocol in which the group of recipients establishes a threshold and generates a public key and shares of a corresponding secret key.

These schemes are particularly useful for ensuring security in mobile ad-hoc networks, which are decentralized networks formed by self-organized and mobile nodes without a fixed infrastructure. The topology of a mobile ad-hoc network changes rapidly and unpredictably, creating challenges for traditional threshold public key encryption schemes. In such dynamic scenarios, where new nodes constantly join and leave the network, standard encryption techniques that require a predefined set of recipients and a fixed threshold may not be suitable. Only a few previous works have addressed the extension of the concept of broadcast encryption to accommodate the challenges of mobile ad-hoc networks.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides background on tools such as secret sharing and public key encryption. Section 3 presents the general definitions of protocols for a threshold broadcast encryption scheme and describes a formal security model for such schemes. Our proposed scheme is introduced in Section 4, and its security is proven by reducing it to the security of the ElGamal encryption scheme. The paper concludes with a summary in Section 5.

The ElGamal cryptosystem is known to be indistinguishable under chosen-plaintext attack (CPA) assuming the hardness of the Decisional Diffie-Hellman (DDH) problem. However, it is not indistinguishable under chosen-ciphertext attack (CCA2) due to its homomorphic properties. Little has been proven about the indistinguishability of the ElGamal encryption scheme under chosen-ciphertext attack (CCA1).

In this paper, we demonstrate that our threshold broadcast encryption scheme provides security comparable to the ElGamal public key encryption scheme. Similar to ElGamal, our scheme is not secure under CCA2 attacks. With regard to CPA and CCA1 attacks, we show that a successful attack against our scheme implies a successful attack against ElGamal.

We assume a simplified scenario in which only one type of corruption is considered, rather than scenarios where the attacker requests the secret key of a previously registered public key. If the second type of corruption is taken into account, the proof is still possible (albeit with a slightly reduced reduction factor) but becomes more complex. We provide a formal proof, focusing specifically on the CCA1 case, while noting that the CPA case can be proved in a similar (though simpler) manner. We assume the existence of a CCA1 attacker against our threshold broadcast encryption scheme, and then construct a CCA1 attacker against the ElGamal scheme.
