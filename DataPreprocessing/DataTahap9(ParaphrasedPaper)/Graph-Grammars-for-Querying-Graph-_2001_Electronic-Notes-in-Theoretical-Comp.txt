The paper presents a method for defining queries that search for subgraphs within a graph, based on a specified graph grammar. Unlike other query languages, this method aims to find entire sub-structures in a graph rather than just individual nodes with particular properties. The paper introduces the concept of graph grammars and parsing graph grammars, and explains how these can be used to identify subgraphs within the original graph.

The method involves using connection instructions to define the substitution of nodes in a graph with embedded graphs, allowing for the identification of substructures within the original graph. The paper also discusses the concept of mapping pairs, which are derived from graph grammars and used to identify subgraphs within a given data graph.

Furthermore, the paper explains how checking properties and extended graph queries can be used to identify and extract subgraphs from a data graph based on a specified graph grammar and formula. Overall, the paper proposes a novel approach for querying and extracting subgraphs from graphs based on specified graph grammars.
