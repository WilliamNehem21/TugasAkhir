In order to mitigate the risks to human safety associated with clearing water surfaces and to enhance the efficiency of the cleaning process, it is proposed that traditional methods be replaced by autonomous cleaning robots. These robots can access hazardous areas inaccessible to humans and are capable of thoroughly cleaning plastic debris. Moreover, a high degree of automation allows the robots to transport, contain, remove, and maneuver materials with minimal human intervention, thereby significantly increasing cleaning efficiency. To ensure comprehensive removal of plastics and other debris from the entire waterbody, it is essential for the cleaning robot to completely cover the water surface. Consequently, the development of a coverage cleaning path is crucial for guiding the robot. In this study, advanced coverage area planning techniques such as boustrophedon cellular and linesweep-based decomposition algorithms have been utilized in the current system to create coverage paths that can adapt to irregular boundaries and obstacles. Motion parameters including low turning speed and acceleration play a critical role in achieving greater coverage area and cleaning efficiency. 

This study introduces an innovative prototype of an autonomous water surface waste cleaning robot capable of effectively cleaning water surfaces without human assistance. The proposed robot can be used in a variety of water bodies, including lakes, oceans, coastal areas, and inland streams. A novel path planning technique is recommended to enhance the robot's cleaning effectiveness, particularly in waterways with irregular boundaries and obstructions. Additionally, the design incorporates the use of single shot detection (SSD) for increased accuracy. 

The paper's composition consists of the following sections: 
1. Section 2: Discussion of related work on plastic waste removal robots in water bodies and coverage path planning.
2. Section 3: Explanation of the proposed robot prototype and coverage area algorithm.
3. Section 4: Presentation of investigational findings and discussions. 
4. Section 5: Conclusion.

Robots designed to collect water garbage waste are commonly referred to as unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), which have diverse applications including transportation, surveillance, and research. Researchers have developed various types of USVs for specific purposes, such as hydrographic surveying, oil spill management, and structural health monitoring. However, existing water surface cleaning robots face limitations in terms of level of automation and ability to adapt to complex real-world environments.

Previous evaluations have been predominantly focused on small water bodies, such as swimming pools, which limits their practical use. Additionally, existing water surface cleaning robots lack advanced path planning capabilities and struggle to adapt to complex real-world environments.
