Mice were administered with doses ranging from 1.82 mg/kg to 3.23 mg/kg body weight, and a safe dose of 1.34 mg/kg was established for each compound. While all compounds inhibited mycobacterial enzymes, their inhibitory effects were lower than that of streptomycin sulphate, which served as the positive control. Compound 19 demonstrated the highest antitubercular activity among the synthesized benzimidazole derivatives, exhibiting inhibitions of 67.56%, 53.45%, and 47.56% against isocitrate lyase, pantothenate synthetase, and chorismate mutase, respectively.

For the enzymatic assay, 1 ml volumes were used, with 39 ml of the test sample diluted in buffer to initiate the reaction. The final concentrations in the reaction mixture included 0.4 mm NADH, 5 mm pantoic acid, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm Î²-alanine, 10 mm ATP, 1 mm potassium phosphoenolpyruvate, and 18 units/ml of each buffer (pH 7.8), 1% DMSO, and 5 mg/ml of the test sample in a total volume of 100 ml. The absorbance at 340 nm was measured using a microplate reader, with readings taken every 12 seconds for 120 seconds. Percent inhibition was calculated using a specific formula. 

In another experimental procedure, cultured cells were stained with sulforhodamine-b, an aminoxanthene dye, in acetic acid for 15 minutes and then washed with 1% acetic acid to remove excess stain. The remaining stain was recovered using tris base solution, and the color intensity was measured using a spectrophotometer. Each assay was performed in triplicate or more.
