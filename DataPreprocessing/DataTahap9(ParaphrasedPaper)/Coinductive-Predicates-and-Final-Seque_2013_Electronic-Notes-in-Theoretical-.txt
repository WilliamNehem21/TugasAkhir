The concept of coinductive predicates involves asserting properties of state-based dynamic systems that persist after a sequence of transitions. Safety properties of nonterminating, reactive systems in computer science are particularly significant, leading to extensive research on specification languages, including fixed point logics and model-checking algorithms.

Coalgebras have been effectively utilized as a categorical abstraction of transition systems, providing general results that apply to a variety of systems simultaneously. Additionally, fixed point logics, particularly coalgebraic modal logic, have been actively studied. The combination of induction and coinduction has been explored in a fibration setting, although primarily over mixed inductive and coinductive data types, rather than over a coalgebra.

Efforts to identify and develop useful coinduction proof principles are ongoing, with a focus on determining their soundness in a general fibrational setting and discovering potential novel proof principles stemming from a fibrational perspective. The introduction of coalgebraic modal logic based on stone-like duality is becoming more common, and there is interest in exploring the fibrational presentation of such dualities and its implications.

Drawing on previous work, this section characterizes coinductive predicates in various settings, using the language of fibration to account for different behavior types and underlying logics. The study focuses primarily on poset fibrations, though applicability to general fibrations is also considered. Inspired by previous research, the paper also explores coinductive predicates for processes modeled in the subobject fibration of a presheaf category, highlighting the distinction in the subobject fibrations of different set categories.
