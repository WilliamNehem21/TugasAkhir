The paper discusses a multi-camera tracking system using a hierarchical optimization methodology to achieve real-time efficiency in dynamic real-life environments. This system utilizes Gaussian mixture models for background reconstruction and blob extraction for object tracking. To optimize the computational complexity, a hierarchical optimization method is proposed, focusing on project-level, algorithm-level, and code-level optimizations. Additionally, the input video signal is down-sampled before undergoing the tracking procedures to reduce computational costs. The multi-camera tracking algorithm is implemented on an embedded platform, and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and stability of the proposed algorithm and the embedded platform. The paper is organized as follows: section 2 presents the proposed multi-camera tracking system, section 3 discusses the proposed hierarchical optimization methodology, section 4 presents the experiments and results, and section 5 provides the conclusions.
