The RFID tag is placed within the reader's communication range, which prompts the tag to transmit its stored data. Once the reader retrieves the data from the tag, it is then transferred to the RFID controller via a network connection such as Ethernet or mobile IP. The controller processes the information based on its type, and may store it in a database or incorporate it into inventory management.
