The paper is organized as follows: it begins with a brief introduction to the restart method at the application level, followed by a discussion of the evaluation of restart strategies in service-oriented systems. Sections 4 and 5 introduce the SFERA framework, and its application is illustrated in Section 6. Section 7 concludes the paper.

The restart method is designed to address faults that affect the completion-time behavior of tasks. In service-oriented systems, common faults such as system failures, network faults, or system overload can lead to increased completion times, including infinite completion times in the case of a failure. The evaluation of restart in service-oriented architecture (SOA) systems therefore focuses on completion times. Restart algorithms can be evaluated using various approaches, including measurements in test-beds, simulation, and analytical methods.

In the measurement-based approach, a testbed is set up with clients, servers, and restart algorithms, and completion times are measured with and without restart. Tools such as Puppet and Genesis can be used to automatically generate testbeds, allowing for the collection of realistic system completion times and timeouts. However, experiments using this approach are limited by available hardware and long runtimes.

A simulation framework for modeling service-oriented architectures was presented, combining an extended version of process chains and quantitative specifications to describe SOA components and the network connecting independent services in detail. While the framework allows for the evaluation of restart, its scalability to large numbers of clients is limited due to its highly detailed approach.

Completion times are collected either as raw data files or as statistics using the objects provided by OMNeT++. These data are written to output files, enabling further investigation using external scripts. For performance reasons, the SFERA framework does not utilize the built-in data storage and analysis facilities of OMNeT++.

A testbed composed of four web services with real functionality was used to conduct experiments, with and without injected packet-loss between the client and the testbed service. Completion times were approximated with acyclic phase-type distributions using the PHFit phase-type fitting tool, providing an accurate model of the distribution of collected completion times.

Simulations were run using the fixed intervals, Jacobson-Karn, and QEST restart algorithms with appropriate parameters estimated based on the completion times from the testbed. Statistical properties of the experiments with restart were then evaluated, including the empirical mean of completion times as an indicator for the impact of restart algorithms on other statistical measures.
