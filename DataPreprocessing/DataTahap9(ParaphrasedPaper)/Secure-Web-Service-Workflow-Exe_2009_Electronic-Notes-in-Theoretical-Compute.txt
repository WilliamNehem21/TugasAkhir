In the following sections, we outline our concept of the "process slip." Section 2 provides the technological underpinning for our concept and briefly covers related concepts. Section 3 explores the concept of distributed workflows and their specific security issues. The structure of our container is presented in Section 4. Furthermore, Section 5 describes the integration of the process slip in a decentralized workflow and demonstrates how the security properties mentioned in Section 3 are achieved through the integration of our container. This section also includes a brief description of the concept of a security stub and provides a detailed explanation of our workflow execution mechanism. Finally, in the conclusion, we discuss potential avenues for further research in this area.

There is a lack of literature on process security for distributed workflows. The TransiDoc project proposed a scheme for extending the concept of paper document transformations to their digital counterparts as a means of achieving non-repudiation of processes.

Web services built on WSDL, SOAP, and UDDI have become standard for machine-to-machine communication. The WS-* family of protocols covers various middleware-related topics, including messaging, transactions, and security. Best practice patterns and tools for applying security and trust mechanisms already exist for these protocols.

In scenarios with a central authority of a dedicated workflow management system, existing WS-* protocols can provide a certain level of security at the link level. Strategies for adding encryption and integrity measures, such as using a structured container format to support data addressing and implementing access control through tickets or public key infrastructure, are discussed as means for achieving the desired security level.

The integration of the process slip container in a decentralized workflow and the realization of the described security properties is explained in this section. The notation used to present the structure and functionality of the workflow execution concept is specified, and the concept of a security stub used to handle the process slip container is briefly explained. Additionally, a detailed description of the proposed workflow execution is given.

To ensure that our framework meets the security properties outlined in Section 3, a public key infrastructure (PKI) can be utilized, involving the generation of public and private keys and public key certificates for each service deployed during the workflow. The assumption is made that a trusted certificate authority (CA) exists to generate and distribute keys and certificates for workflow participants and to securely distribute them among partners.

This section describes the key steps involved in our custom workflow execution. It is assumed that public/private key pairs and identity certificates have been generated and securely distributed among all potential partners, and that the workflow definition and participating partners are already established.
