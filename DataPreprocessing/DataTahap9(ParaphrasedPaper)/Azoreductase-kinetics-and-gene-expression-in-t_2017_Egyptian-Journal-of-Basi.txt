Microorganisms possess the ability to enzymatically degrade synthetic dyes, which can contribute to the pollution of aquatic environments. In this study, two bacterial isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ASU3 and ASU6) were found to enzymatically degrade disperse blue 64 (DB64) and acid yellow 17 (AY17), two synthetic dyes that are known to contribute to environmental pollution. The expression of the azor1 gene was detected in these bacterial strains, with strain ASU6 showing a higher degradation percentage of DB64 and AY17 compared to ASU3. This difference in degradation capability was attributed to variation in the expression levels of azor1, as confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Furthermore, the specific activity of azoreductase in ASU6 was found to be higher than ASU3 when using methyl red (MR), DB64, and AY17 as substrates. The kinetics of azoreductase were studied to determine the optimal conditions for enzyme stability, and the degraded products were found to be non-toxic to two crop plants.

The toxicity of the dyes and their metabolic products was assessed using an acute toxicity test on two popular crop plants in Egypt, Triticum aestivum (monocot) and Vicia faba (dicot). The study also evaluated the capacity of Pseudomonas strains to decolorize various dyes, with the azo dyes (acid violet 7, acid red 151, and reactive black 5) showing higher degradation (>90%) compared to other dyes such as indigo carmine, acid red 183 (chromium complex), and various anthraquinones. Additionally, the decolorization of wastewater containing reactive azo dyes was achieved using a culture of the bacteria P. luteola.

The study also investigated the effects of different substrates on the transcription of the azoreductase gene, and found that the expression of azor1 was influenced by the type and chemistry of the dye. The results of gene expression were mostly consistent with the results of azoreductase specific activity and degradation percentages, except in the case of DB64 degradation. Notably, the expression of the azor1 gene in strain ASU6 was lower than in ASU3 when DB64 was used as a substrate, despite the higher enzyme specific activity and degradation percentage in ASU6. The discrepancy was attributed to the potential presence of other co-enzymes or cofactors enhancing the activity of azoreductase and the degradation of DB64 in strain ASU6.

The study also examined the enzyme kinetics in the two isolated strains and found that the velocity (Vmax) and substrate affinity (Km) of the enzyme in ASU6 were higher than in ASU3. Despite having a lower Km value, ASU3's azoreductase was more effective as a catalyst than ASU6's.

The investigation found that the percentage of dye degradation varied between the two isolated strains, with ASU3 and ASU6 demonstrating higher efficiency in degrading the anthraquinone dye DB64 compared to AY17. This difference could be due to the relatively easier degradation of anthraquinone dyes, as well as the potentially complex structure of AY17 hindering its degradation. The study also expressed gratitude to the Assiut University Mycological Center for their assistance in sample identification and preservation, as well as to Prof. Dr. Mostafa Fouad and Dr. Usama Ramadan from the Faculty of Pharmacy at El Minia University for their help in the HPLC/MS analysis and identifications.
