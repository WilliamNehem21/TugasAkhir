Modeling and simulating changes in land use and land cover (LULC) provides important foundational information for predicting future development scenarios. These models can aid in land use planning by identifying issues such as degradation and deforestation. Given the crucial role of land use changes in urban planning, extensive research efforts have been dedicated to understanding the key drivers influencing these changes. Verburg et al.'s (2004) study advocates for innovative techniques to accurately measure the effects of neighboring areas in light of the complex nature of land use systems. Furthermore, the study emphasizes the importance of integrating temporal dynamics to achieve a higher level of coherence across models investigating land use changes, encompassing various factors such as transportation, demographics, erosion, and groundwater.

Efforts to understand and predict LULC changes in Southeast Asian countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia are driven by rapid urban expansion, agricultural land loss, deforestation, and other alterations resulting from population growth and economic development. For instance, large-scale deforestation for palm oil plantation expansion in response to international market demands has been particularly significant. Additionally, rapid urbanization, alongside small-scale deforestation due to poverty-related indigenous agriculture, is prevalent in developing countries within the region. The variations in drivers of LULC changes across Southeast Asia highlight the importance of continual monitoring of land use patterns, which has been achieved through various methods such as remote sensing, geographic information systems (GIS) applications, and artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms.

Studies such as Handayani et al. (2018) and Sharma et al. (2018) have utilized geospatial analysis and GIS-based integrated modeling approaches to assess LULC changes, demonstrating the value of these methods in understanding spatial patterns and transitions in land use. The Multilayer Perception Artificial Neural Network (MLP-ANN) has been particularly notable for its efficacy in pattern recognition and classification tasks. Utilizing MLP-ANN models, researchers have been able to effectively associate input features with specific LULC classes, facilitating accurate classification and analysis of LULC patterns. The application of MLP-ANN models has allowed for the management of large datasets and projections of land use changes, offering valuable insights for land use planning and management decisions.

Transition matrices have been utilized to visually represent changes in LULC classifications over time, enabling decision-makers to plan and implement effective and sustainable land use management and conservation strategies. By analyzing these transition matrices, it becomes possible to gain insights into the patterns and trends of LULC changes, which can inform various purposes including urban planning, environmental management, and natural resource management. Furthermore, the use of MLP-ANN models has enabled the prediction of future LULC changes, acknowledging the influence of human activities on the landscape and the potential impact of industrialization and urbanization on land use patterns.

In the context of Davao City, Philippines, MLP-ANN models have been applied to predict changes in LULC. These models have been trained using exploratory maps derived from geographic information such as elevation and distance to the road network. The accuracy of the predicted maps for 2021 demonstrates the reliability of the MLP-ANN model in simulating LULC changes. Forecasts for 2030 and 2050 show a projected increase in built area and changes in the distribution of tree cover and agricultural land, signaling the influence of human activities on LULC changes.

While the MLP-ANN model has proven to be a valuable tool for predicting future LULC changes, there are opportunities to enhance its results by incorporating the impact of climate change and other meteorological and hydrological parameters. Addressing these limitations would contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of how land use patterns evolve in Davao City and inform sustainable development strategies for the future.
