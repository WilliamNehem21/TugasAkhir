This academic paper introduces a novel approach to using an abstract symbolic representation of Kripke structures in the context of bounded model checking (BMC). Unlike most formal presentations of BMC, which conflate the BMC translation from LTL syntax to propositional logic syntax with its semantics, this approach separates the translation and semantics. Although the approach is more detailed, the authors argue that it is easier to understand, particularly when dealing with the auxiliary variables introduced by the translation.

The following sections of the paper are structured as follows: Section 2 presents the foundations of the denotational approach, closely following the logic of the original BMC translation. Section 3 provides a high-level overview of the new translation, which is split into two phases: the normalization phase covered in Section 4 and the translation to propositional logic phase in Section 5. Related work is discussed in Section 6, and conclusions are drawn in Section 7.

The original BMC translation consists of step 2 without steps 1 and 3, and even with careful optimizations, the size of the original translation is claimed to be cubic in the worst case. However, the normalization in step 1 enables factoring for linear size in step 3.

The BMC journal paper presents a translation that exploits fixpoint characterizations, but the encoding size is not linear in the bound. The authors point out that the translation is not sound as it appears to be using a greatest fixpoint characterization for all the LTL operators, which is clearly unsound for 'f' and 'u'. They suggest that this mistake could have been avoided if the translation had been derived within a formal framework such as the one presented in their paper.
