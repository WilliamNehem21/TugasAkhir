Software patches are released to address security vulnerabilities, improve performance, and enhance usability. Prior research has mainly focused on assessing the impact of patches on benchmark runtimes. This study employed a top-down microarchitecture analysis approach to examine how pipeline bottlenecks were influenced by the spectre and meltdown security patches. Bottleneck analysis enables a better understanding of how various hardware resources are utilized and helps identify areas of the pipeline where potential improvements can be made. In addition to the top-down analysis method, the study utilized a normalization technique from economics, known as purchasing power parity (PPP), to gain insights into the relative differences between runs with and without patches. The study demonstrated that security patches had an impact on the top-down metrics and indicated that recent compilers were not as negatively affected as previously believed. Among the benchmarks in the spec omp2012 suite, three showed noticeable slowdowns after the patches were applied. Furthermore, the study highlighted substantial relative differences in top-down metrics that were not evident based on standard absolute, non-normalized metrics.

In January 2018, two significant vulnerabilities, spectre and meltdown, were disclosed, allowing attackers to access data stored in memory or caches by exploiting CPU features that enable speculative execution. Concerns were raised that the security fixes might substantially impair performance by restricting the speculative capabilities of CPUs.

The study employed several Cray supercomputers to analyze the impact of patches on runtime performance across multiple benchmarks and found that the overall effect of the security patches was minimal. Another study investigated the effects of different patches on two computationally intensive workflows, pmatlab and keras with tensorflow, on an Intel-based cluster, revealing substantial negative effects, with performance decreases of up to 21% for pmatlab and 16% for tensorflow after the CPU microcode update was applied.

The study focused on analyzing the effects of patches on pipeline bottlenecks specifically related to the spectre and meltdown vulnerabilities. Different variant security patches provided by the OS vendor were applied to the system, and various top-down metrics were used to track and analyze the bottlenecks. The study also examined the state of the security patches using a verification script and utilized the PPP technique to highlight and quantify relative differences in bottleneck profiles between patched and unpatched runs.

The study revealed that enabling the patches led to a decrease in the DSB metric and an increase in the backend bound metric. Rates for L2 bound, bad speculation, and branch mispredicts metrics were also impacted when the security patches were enabled. Additionally, the study compared its findings with previous research that focused on the effects of patches on performance across different clusters and workflows, indicating varying degrees of performance impact.

The study showcased that top-down classification metrics varied when security patches were applied and demonstrated the value of utilizing PPP normalized rates to contextualize large percentage changes in relative differences between metrics. The study expressed intentions to further investigate the effects of these relative changes on power efficiency and to explore the relationship between PPP rates and power efficiency.
