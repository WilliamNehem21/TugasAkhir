The academic paper introduces parametric synchronized hyperedge replacement (PSHR) as a graph transformation formalism in which productions specifying the behavior of individual components can be synchronized to yield complete transitions. PSHR offers a user-definable synchronization model, enhancing its applicability. The paper proposes a simplified and more intuitive semantics for PSHR while maintaining its expressive power. Additionally, the authors demonstrate how common synchronization models can be formalized and utilized within PSHR, simplifying the modeling process for the airport case study in the FET-GC project agile.

The authors discuss various existing approaches to the problem in the literature, ranging from UML to different architectural description languages. They opt for the synchronized hyperedge replacement (SHR) framework, which models the system as a (hyper)graph with components connected through common nodes, providing a strong mathematical foundation and a visual representation. In SHR, component behavior is specified by synchronized productions.

While PSHR is shown to be highly expressive, its formal semantics is complex and challenging to comprehend, a common issue with other SHR variants. This complexity is exacerbated in PSHR due to the management of different synchronization models. The paper proposes a more intuitive semantics, characterized by the direct characterization of allowed synchronizations on a node by a specific Synchronization Action Model (SAM). The semantics are set-theoretic and not algebraic, addressing the challenges of the original formal semantics.

The paper also illustrates how a synchronization model can be formalized as a SAM and utilized in PSHR to model system evolution. The authors apply this approach to the airport case study within the FET-GC project agile, demonstrating how parametric synchronization leads to a simpler model than previous approaches. The authors discuss the differences between the proposed semantics and the older one, highlighting the refinement achieved in the new approach.

The paper concludes by acknowledging that the newly proposed semantics formalize a more refined approach to PSHR compared to the older one. While the two approaches allow slightly different classes of SAMs, a formal theorem is not presented to relate the two semantics. Finally, the authors demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach to the airport case study in the FET-GC project agile, acknowledging the simplifications made for illustrative purposes and referring readers to a more comprehensive study for a complete modeling approach.
