The current definition of 'generality' in this paper is specific to simple graphs. However, the underlying concept is applicable to a broader range of graphical structures such as multigraphs, directed graphs (bi-rank-width), hypergraphs, and Petri nets. This implies that the foundational theory should be developed in a more general context.

Let's take a ring R (e.g., the integers) as the source for the entries of our matrices, which we will not specifically denote in order to simplify notation. We will use the variables r and s to range over R.

Furthermore, if [k] = [l], then k + kt = l + lt. Since k and l are upper triangular, they agree in all non-diagonal entries. The ith diagonal entry of k + kt = l + lt is 2k_ii = 2l_ii. Given the additional assumption on R, k_ii = l_ii.2
