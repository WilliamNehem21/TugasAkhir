Hayward et al. focused on developing, implementing, and assessing an electronic integrated care pathway (EICP) in a mother and baby unit. The EICP was created using the Microsoft Access program, and the authors measured its effectiveness through surveys and discussion groups during the initial stages of its development.

In the first step of their process, the researchers determined categories of variance by analyzing the content and keywords of each instance of variance. These variance categories included patient condition, hospital system issues, caregiver-related problems, and family placement challenges.

In the second step, keywords related to the actual causes of the variances were extracted from user input and decomposed into subject, object, and predicate factors. This process was guided by the case structure of the sentence and the specific contents of the causes of the variances.

The researchers mentioned the construction of a system that combined a published thesaurus and a small psychiatry thesaurus to process unknown words that were not registered in the variance database. They proposed evaluating this method for variance analysis by comparing it to the existing manual sorting method. They also described the development of the psychiatric patient and suggested an automatic variance analysis based on VAKB (variance analysis knowledge base). This method aimed to complement the analysis process that was traditionally reliant on the experience of the analyst.

The authors acknowledged the importance of collecting a large volume of variance data in order to establish this analysis method. They highlighted the need for the development of a thesaurus based on accumulated variance data, as the classification method relied on utilizing the thesaurus. They expressed plans to collect system error, bug, and variance data for system improvement in the future.
