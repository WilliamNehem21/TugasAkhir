Inference Rules:

1. For a set of inference rules to form a sound and complete deduction calculus for the logic, it must ensure termination if the logic is decidable.

2. Hyperresolution on range-restricted clauses ensures that all positive parent clauses are ground clauses and all conclusions are ground clauses, allowing the negative, non-ground parent clause of a hyperresolution inference step to be interpreted as an inference rule i of the ground calculus. The positive, ground parent clauses of a hyperresolution inference step represent the premises of the rule i, and the conclusions represent the conclusions of the rule.

3. Redundancy elimination is an important notion in first-order resolution and carries over to other calculi, leading to three forms of redundancy: redundant formulae, redundant rule applications, and notably redundant inference rules. Reasoning modulo redundancy can be formalized for modal deduction calculi leading to stronger results and better systems.

4. Empirical studies undertaken with (m)spass following essentially this approach allow more meaningful comparisons of different calculi or different styles of deduction than experiments based on the comparisons of independently implemented provers.
