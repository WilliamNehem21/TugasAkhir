This academic paper describes the use of the L-BFGS-B algorithm to update the Gaussian process model in the context of a multi-agent model with complex dynamical behaviors. The paper also showcases the application of sample-efficient Bayesian optimization with Gaussian process surrogate models to explore and visualize the parameter space, as well as to predict reward-capture performance for a spatial cooperative foraging task in neuroswarms simulations. Additionally, the paper demonstrates the visualization of parameter points and the identification of high-performing clusters of parameters using UMAP embeddings, and it discusses the potential for future work in developing new controller models and exploring the capabilities of multi-agent objective functions in diverse environments. The research was funded by the National Science Foundation, the NIH National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke, and the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, with additional support from the Johns Hopkins University Kavli Neuroscience Discovery Institute and the JHUAPL Innovation and Collaboration Janney Program. The paper also provides information about Mr. Armin Hadzic, a computer vision researcher at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, including his educational background and research interests.
