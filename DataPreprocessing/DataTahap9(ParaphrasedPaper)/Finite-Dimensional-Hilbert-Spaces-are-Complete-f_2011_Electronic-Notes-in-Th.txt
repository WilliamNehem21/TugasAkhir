Before attempting to prove theorem 2.2, we simplify the statement by following a similar line of reasoning as Hasegawa, Hofmann, and Plotkin. It is sufficient, without loss of generality, to consider terms m and n that meet certain additional conditions, namely {a1, a2, a4}. We define [a]m to be a 2-dimensional Hilbert space with an orthonormal basis {b3, b5}. It is worth noting that the naming of the basis vectors is intended to suggest a relationship between the basis vectors of [a]m and the wires labeled a in the diagram m, and likewise for [b]m.
