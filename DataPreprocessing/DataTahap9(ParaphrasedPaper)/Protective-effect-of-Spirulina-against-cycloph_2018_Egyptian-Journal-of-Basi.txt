The drug cyclophosphamide (CP) has been utilized in the treatment of specific types of cancer, such as lymphoma, leukemia, and multiple myeloma, as well as non-malignant conditions like rheumatoid arthritis. However, CP is associated with numerous adverse effects, including a significant one which is hemorrhagic cystitis (HC), stemming from acute inflammation of the urinary bladder. The metabolic product of CP, acrolein, reacts rapidly at various cellular sites, leading to the depletion of cellular antioxidants and interaction with specific protein residues and nucleophilic sites of DNA.

Biological systems have various biomolecular agents to protect themselves from damage caused by free radicals. Glutathione (GSH) is the most abundant intracellular thiol-based antioxidant and plays a critical role in the cellular defense system against oxidative injury. GSH, functioning as a cofactor for glutathione peroxidase, aids in the reduction of hydrogen peroxide to oxygen and water, thereby limiting the formation of highly toxic hydroxyl radicals.

CP, acquired from Baxter Oncology Chemical Co. (Egypt) and dissolved in 0.9% NaCl solution to form a stock solution, was injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) into mice. On the other hand, Spirulina platensis (SP) was administrated orally to mice via intragastric gavage after being provided as a fine dark blue-green powder by the Botany Department Faculty of Science Zagazig University (Zagazig, Egypt) and dissolved in sterile distilled water to prepare a stock solution.

At the end of the 9-day period, all mice were euthanized, and blood samples were collected for analysis. The study has shown that CP belongs to a class of alkylating agents, known as nitrogen mustard derivatives, and is commonly used as an immunosuppressive and chemotherapeutic agent in the treatment of various autoimmune diseases and neoplasms. CP is known to induce oxidative stress by overproducing reactive oxygen species (ROS), affecting the DNA of replicating and rapidly multiplying cells, resulting in miscoding, crosslinking, and breakage.

SP, a widely used herbal medicine, has demonstrated various pharmacological properties, including anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, anti-diabetic, anti-microbial, anti-histaminic, anti-infertility, and hypotensive effects. Clinical trials have reported its efficacy as a supplementary treatment for numerous diseases and in improving immunological function.

The study revealed that SP pretreatment prevented CP-induced oxidative damage in the urinary bladders of mice, as indicated by reduced levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), a marker of oxidative stress. SP's protective effects against CP-induced acute urotoxicity are attributed to its antioxidant properties, and the increase in zinc and selenium concentration in the blood of mice after SP ingestion suggests a role in alleviating CP-associated toxicity.

Additionally, SP treatment alleviated hematological disturbances caused by CP in mice, including anemia and thrombocytopenia. These findings indicate that SP may also protect against toxicity induced by other chemotherapeutic agents with similar mechanisms of action as CP.

In conclusion, SP has shown promise in mitigating the side effects of CP and other drugs, potentially making it a beneficial food supplement for individuals undergoing drug therapy.
