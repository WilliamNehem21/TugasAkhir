The use of a linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) controller in large antenna servo control systems is advantageous over a proportional integral (PI) controller in terms of stability, speed, and disturbance suppression. However, determining the appropriate weight matrices for the LQG controller to achieve optimal performance remains a challenge. To address this issue, this paper proposes a method that utilizes the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm to optimize the transient response performance of the closed-loop system. By integrating global and local searching processes within each iteration, the ABC algorithm enhances the efficiency of the search for optimal solutions. When applied to the optimization of weight matrices for an LQG controller in a large antenna servo system, the algorithm demonstrates satisfactory simulation results and outperforms traditional trial-and-error methods in terms of control effectiveness.

The ABC algorithm, inspired by the foraging behavior of bee colonies, was introduced by Karaboga et al. in 2007 and has since gained attention from researchers due to its simplicity and minimal parameter adjustments. In comparison to genetic algorithms and particle swarm optimization, the ABC algorithm's combined global and local search approach increases the likelihood of identifying global optimal solutions while avoiding local optima. Previous studies have successfully applied the ABC algorithm to a range of optimization problems, including unconstrained numerical optimization, constrained numerical optimization, and neural network training, yielding favorable simulation and experimental outcomes.

This paper outlines an optimization approach that utilizes the ABC algorithm to determine the weight matrices for an LQG controller. By establishing a reference model that defines the desired closed-loop performance, the ABC algorithm automatically selects and optimizes the weight matrices, thereby streamlining the design process and improving the efficiency of the LQG controller. Simulations conducted on a large antenna servo system validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the algorithm, highlighting its ability to enhance the rapidity, stability, and overshoot of the system when the optimized weight matrices are implemented.
