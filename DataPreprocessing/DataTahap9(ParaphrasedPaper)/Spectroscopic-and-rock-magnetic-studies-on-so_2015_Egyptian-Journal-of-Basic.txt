The study aimed to investigate the magnetic properties of ancient ceramics under low magnetic fields and establish a correlation between these properties and the percentage of fe2+/fe3+ and iron oxides. The obtained information would contribute to a better understanding of the technological advancements in the ancient past and the suitability of the samples for determining reliable ancient geomagnetic field intensity values.

Ceramics are considered one of the earliest and most significant human innovations and played a crucial role in the rapid technological developments that characterized early human societies. Pottery, in particular, holds great archaeological importance, providing valuable insights into past cultures and societies due to its distinct features and widespread distribution across different regions and time periods.

The absence of well-ordered iron oxides and the presence of superparamagnetic behavior indicated that the ceramics were not fired at high temperatures or contained iron oxide particles that were less than 100 nm in size. This is supported by the absence of well-ordered sextets in the magnetic spectra, as well as findings from rock magnetic studies. Furthermore, the color variations in the ceramics suggested different firing conditions, such as oxidizing or reducing atmospheres, as well as the presence of specific minerals responsible for these colors.

The chemical and magnetic analyses revealed the presence of iron oxides, predominantly hematite and magnetite, as the primary colorants in the ceramics. The specific magnetic susceptibility and thermal stability of the magnetic minerals indicated the possibility of alteration to magnetite curie phase during laboratory heating, which aligned with the observed irreversibility behavior in the samples.

Overall, the study provided valuable insights into the magnetic properties of ancient ceramics, shedding light on their manufacturing processes, firing conditions, and the presence of specific magnetic minerals, which have implications for understanding ancient technological developments and the reliability of using ceramics for archaeointensity measurements.
