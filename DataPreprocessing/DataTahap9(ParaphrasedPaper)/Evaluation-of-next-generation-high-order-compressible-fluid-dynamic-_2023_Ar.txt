The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the spatial and temporal algorithms implemented in ssdc, while Section 3 provides an overview of the software implementation and infrastructure. Section 4 describes the computing environments of the on-premise ibex cluster and Amazon EC2 cloud computing environment. In Section 5, performance results of the ssdc solver on ibex and Amazon EC2 clusters for test case studies are presented. Finally, the conclusion and future work are outlined in Section 6.

This study aims to assess the performance of the ssdc solver on ibex and Amazon EC2 clusters for complex flow problems and provide the current cost per core hour. The default number of CPU cores for an EC2 instance depends on its type, and hyperthreading was disabled to utilize the available physical CPU cores. The arithmetic average of the wall-clock time (WCT) in seconds from three independent runs and the associated estimated cost in US dollars (USD) are reported in the following sections.

In all runs, transitioning from the c5a.4xlarge to the c5a.8xlarge instances led to a reduction in the wall-clock time by approximately 35% to 40%. Additionally, the smallest wall-clock time was achieved using the EC2 ARM c6g instances for all orders of accuracy, with nearly perfect scaling observed.
