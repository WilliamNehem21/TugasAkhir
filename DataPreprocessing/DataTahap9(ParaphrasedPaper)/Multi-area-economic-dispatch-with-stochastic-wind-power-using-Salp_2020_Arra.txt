Swarm intelligence (SI) based algorithms are widely used for optimization and are known for their effectiveness. These algorithms demonstrate key features such as self-organization and division of labor to accomplish a given task. Notably, various SI-based algorithms, such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) Optimization, Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA), Spider Monkey Optimization (SMO), Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), and Teaching-Learning Based Optimization (TLBO), mimic the behaviors of different animals to achieve optimization.

Additionally, the paper introduces the Weibull probability density function model for wind power calculation. To assess the performance of the Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA) for the Multi-Area Economic Dispatch (MAED) problem, the paper presents evaluations of four cases with varying dimensions and complexity levels, which involve non-linear, multimodal, non-convex, discontinuous, and probabilistic behaviors due to wind integration. Results obtained using SSA are compared with those reported in recent studies.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the problem formulation, combining the concepts of MAED, wind power modeling, and related constraints. Section 3 presents the concept behind SSA, its foraging behavior using an analytical model, and the implementation procedure for solving the MAED problem. Section 4 covers the description of test cases, the effect of control parameters, simulation results, and their discussion. Finally, Section 5 draws conclusions.

The primary objective of the MAED problem is to minimize the total operating cost across all areas while satisfying various operational constraints, including power balance, minimum and maximum power generation limits, reserve requirements, and area-wise capacity constraints.

SSA is a bio-inspired optimization technique based on the navigation and foraging behavior of salp chains found in deep oceans. In its mathematical model, the salp population is split into leader and follower groups, with the best salp considered the food source to be followed. After each iteration, the leader salp changes its position relative to the food sources and explores the search space around the best solution.

SSA's performance is evaluated and validated across four standard test cases of MAED problems with different dimensions and complexity levels. The algorithm is implemented in the MATLAB environment and executed on a specific hardware setup, producing simulation results for the test cases.

For instance, Test Case IV involves a two-area network with a combined wind-thermal system and forty generating units. The wind-thermal system includes three wind generators and parameters such as Weibull scale and shape factor. The results show that SSA obtained a total cost solution of 120857.2447, demonstrating its effectiveness in solving MAED problems.

In conclusion, SSA shows promising results, achieving the lowest cost compared to other metaheuristics for MAED problems, thereby indicating its global search capability and effectiveness.
