This academic paper explores the potential application of two-dimensional linear algebra to concurrency, drawing inspiration from the structure of categories of wirings, particularly in action calculi and other models of concurrency. The authors investigate the concept of symmetric monoidal sketch as a way to provide an abstract representation of the category of wirings, noting that each symmetric monoidal sketch generates a generic model. In the case of a single-sorted sketch, the generic model can be characterized as a free structure on 1, with its structure defined in a coalgebraic manner. The authors also discuss the generalization of these findings in relation to existing results on categories of wirings by Milner and others, and consider potential extensions of the constructs to model controls and dynamics.

In a specific section, the paper delves into categories of wirings and their structure, referencing the work on action calculi and their semantic models as a primary example. The definition of an action calculus is found to rely on the underlying wiring category, where the composition in the category of actions is used to represent data-flow, and the tensor product is employed for parallel composition. The authors suggest that, in action calculus, parallel composition embodies symmetries, diagonals, and discards due to its nature of being symmetric, and note that this understanding was recognized in the action calculus work.

The paper further characterizes the category of wirings, utilizing concepts from category theory such as strict monoidal categories and commutative monoids in a symmetric strict monoidal category. The authors introduce the notion of models and maps of models in the context of a strict symmetric monoidal category, and establish a category of models and maps of models. Additionally, they discuss the concept of freeness and cofreeness in their constructions, noting that the presence of cofreeness goes beyond mere freeness and represents a distinctive feature of linear algebra compared to universal algebra. The paper then explores this aspect in more detail.
