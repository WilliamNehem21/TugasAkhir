The optimization of the secondary steel refining (SSR) and electric arc furnace (EAF) ratio can result in carbon emissions reduction (CER), but only if the compound annual growth rate of continuous casting and rolling (CSP) remains below 2.2%. In such a scenario, the SSR and EAF ratios would need to be adjusted to 50.0%, 14.8%, and 84.0%, respectively, in order to maintain carbon emissions at 2021 levels by 2030. Conversely, emissions of particulate matter (PM) are expected to increase by 8% due to the rise in steel scrap recycling rates. This emphasizes the significance of limiting CSP growth in order to effectively reduce carbon and pollution emissions. It is also important to implement measures related to raw material composition and technological adjustments to achieve these limiting targets.

The findings indicate that a 2% annual growth rate for CSP will only enable carbon emissions in 2030 to be comparable to those in 2021 through increased utilization of steel scrap and EAF facilities. However, this growth will result in a continual rise in the emission of various pollutants such as particulate matter, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PHPs), and sulfur dioxide. The need for stricter enforcement to control CSP is emphasized, particularly in light of the fact that production exceeded the 2021 control target by 35 million tons and reached 81% of the annual control target in the first three quarters of 2022.

The results also highlight the variability in the relationship between carbon emission reduction (CER) and pollution emission reduction (PER) when employing different low-carbon emission measures, due to differences in carbon emission intensity (CEI) and pollution emission intensity (PEI) across different processes. Additionally, the emissions of particulate matter may exhibit contrary trends compared to other pollutants such as chemical oxygen demand (COD), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen oxides (NOx). Therefore, it is essential to integrate the development path of the industry with this variability in mind and focus on multiple objectives, taking into account regional differences in environmental capacity.
