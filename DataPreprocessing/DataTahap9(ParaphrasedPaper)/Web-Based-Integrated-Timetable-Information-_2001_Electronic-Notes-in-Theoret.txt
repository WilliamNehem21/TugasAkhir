Definition 2.2 specifies that a free arc in a directed multigraph is an arc with no specified time limit. The weight of a free arc is a continuous function of the time, denoted as 't', at which the arc leaves the starting node. This function depends on the mode of transportation being used.

When finding connections from a source to a destination, an algorithm such as Dijkstra's algorithm or one of its variants can be utilized. At each node, two values are assessed: the current time of entering the node and the current weight of the connection. Based on the presented model, the path weights are compared at the visited nodes. Additionally, factors such as time of arrival, number of changes, and time of departure (preferably as late as possible) can be included in the path weights.

To find the optimal connection, which is defined as the connection with the earliest arrival time (given the departure time) or the latest departure time (given the arrival time), the optimality criterion considers the weight or cost associated with a single change (referred to as the 'p' parameter).
