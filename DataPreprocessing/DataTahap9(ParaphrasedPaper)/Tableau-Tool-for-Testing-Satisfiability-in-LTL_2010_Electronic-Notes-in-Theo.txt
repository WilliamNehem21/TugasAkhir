Research in the field of description logics has demonstrated that algorithms designed for theoretically computationally challenging problems can effectively solve many practically significant problems, especially when combined with optimization techniques. This observation suggests that the practical utility of algorithms may not always align with their theoretical worst-case complexity, a phenomenon which also appears to be applicable to linear temporal logic (LTL).

During testing, memory usage for both tools was closely monitored to prevent the system from running out of memory, as this would lead to the use of virtual memory and significantly increase processing times. It's important to note that virtual memory was not utilized in any of the reported tests.

To ensure the correctness of the implementation, large sets of formulae that were known to be satisfiable, as well as those known to be unsatisfiable, were generated and tested. In particular, sets of formulae created by M. Montali were used, and one of these sets revealed a bug in an earlier version of the program.
