The paper discusses the application of blockchain technology in education systems and proposes a secure learning system using blockchain-enabled node authentication. It highlights the benefits of blockchain technology such as decentralization, security, transparency, and immutability. The paper presents different solutions used in the proposed system, discusses the architecture of the secure learning system, and illustrates an experiment with results.

Islam et al. propose a project for distributing test questions securely using blockchain technology, while Guo et al. create a public and private blockchain-based infrastructure for sharing multimedia material in online education. The use of blockchain technology and smart contracts supports the interaction between students and professors, as well as the management and sharing of educational multimedia resources.

Mondal et al. introduce an electronic health record (EHR) management method by combining blockchain multisignature stamps and a private channel structure to address data ownership and authority issues. The paper also explores the use of chaotic systems and DNA computing in cryptography, emphasizing their security and resilience to cryptanalysis. Additionally, the paper presents a new group theory-based binary spring search technique and discusses the security and privacy implications of using blockchain techniques for privacy preservation.

The paper also explains the implementation of a 256-bit cryptosystem for security, along with the use of chaotic maps and DNA grouping for information storage. It also delves into the evaluation of statistical features of the presented function and future plans to test the proposed techniques using smart contracts and the Ethereum network for verification and authentication of marks. Finally, the paper highlights the need for a professional platform to deploy, schedule, and manage smart contracts.
