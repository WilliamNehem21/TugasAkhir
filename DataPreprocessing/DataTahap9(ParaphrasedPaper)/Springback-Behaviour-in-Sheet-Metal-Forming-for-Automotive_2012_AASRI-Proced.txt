This study investigates the springback behavior in sheet metal forming processes by using numerical simulations to explore the impact of different parameters. Nonlinear finite element analysis is performed using the Abaqus/CAE software to simulate the process. The study focuses on two key parameters: the material type of the sheet metal and the sheet thickness. The material types investigated include boron steel (AISI 15B48H) and composite materials such as carbon fiber reinforced plastics. The computational results indicate that carbon fiber reinforced plastic exhibits less springback than boron steel, and thicker sheets show reduced springback compared to thinner sheets. These findings are validated by existing literature data. The paper also briefly examines current and future trends in automotive door design and offers recommendations for future developments in simulation techniques.

The study highlights the challenge of springback, where the material partially returns to its original shape upon release of the forming force due to elastic recovery. This issue is particularly critical in industries such as automotive and aircraft manufacturing, where precise dimensional control is crucial for component assembly. Minimizing springback is essential for achieving better process control and reducing rejected parts.

To determine the influential factors and parameters affecting the results, three simulation frameworks are employed, each varying the material type and thickness. The models include three rigid parts (die, punch, and binder) and one deformable part (sheet metal blank), with data collected from the deformable sheet metal blank. The finite element analysis provides data on von Mises stress, strain, displacement, section thickness, and energy.

A comparison of the section thickness distribution between AISI 15B48H steel and CFRP indicates that the latter exhibits more consistent thickness distribution, which is crucial for product quality.

The findings from the springback simulation support the conclusion that a higher springback value is associated with a thinner part (1mm), higher friction coefficient (0.25), and stiffer material (AISI 15B48H steel), consistent with previous research. This underscores the influence of factors such as material hardness, friction coefficient, and sheet thickness on springback behavior.
