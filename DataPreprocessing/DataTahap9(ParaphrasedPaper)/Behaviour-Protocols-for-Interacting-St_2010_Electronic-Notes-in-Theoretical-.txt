The challenge in system development lies in the combination of control flow and data flow aspects, particularly in concurrent environments, which is not well understood. While pre/postcondition style specifications are known to be ineffective for concurrent systems, it is necessary to explore the potential of integrating both aspects in such environments. This includes studying the impact on specifications, implementations, formal correctness, compatibility notions, composition, and independent implementability.

The paper is structured as follows: it initially provides technical preliminaries, introduces the main structural elements of the component model, defines behavior protocols, considers their compatibility, and presents a formal, model-theoretic semantics for behavior protocols in terms of component implementations and assembly implementations, along with the central compositionality result.

Behavior protocols serve to specify component and assembly behaviors. A formal semantics of the specification is desirable to understand its meaning unambiguously and to serve as a basis for analysis and further reasoning. Unlike other approaches, communication between components is not treated as invisible actions and must conform to the protocol for assembly implementations.

Although there are related approaches based on symbolic transition systems (STS), none of them focus specifically on formal correctness notions for implementations and contractual interpretation of pre- and postconditions. The paper proposes an examination of how model checking techniques used in existing approaches could be adapted to check compatibility of components.

The paper also discusses behavior protocols as contract-oriented descriptions of assumptions and guarantees regarding the implementor and user of a component. It aims to contribute to developing concurrent, component-oriented systems that consider data states of components. The approach is independent at the specification level from a particular assertion language for pre- and postconditions and at the implementation level from a specific programming language notation, although future research may explore instantiation to concrete languages such as OCL for assertions, UML for protocols, and concurrent Java for implementations.
