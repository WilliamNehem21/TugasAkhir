This academic paper discusses the use of iterative processes based on fractal geometry to generate complex objects such as terrains, clouds, trees, and textures, typically utilizing stochastic parameters for modeling natural objects with non-strict repetition. While such algorithms are widely used in computer graphics, their application in computer aided geometric design (CAGD) is limited, despite the interesting properties of the resulting shapes, such as rough surfaces for heat exchange improvement, porous volumes requiring less material, and aesthetic appeal. The study aims to develop a generic iterative geometric modeler for industrial applications linked to additive manufacturing, with a specific focus on creating lighter objects with high mechanical properties to address the industry's energy-saving needs.

The paper explores the representation of Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) tensor-surfaces as Cellular Iterated Function Systems (CIFS) automata to enable their integration into the iterative modeler. It introduces mathematical notations and background information in two distinct research fields - IFS and CIFS, and NURBS and their representation. The research aligns at the intersection of these two fields.

The paper presents a method for modeling free-form shapes with CIFS, achieved by constructing attractors in barycentric space and then projecting them into the modeling space based on a set of control points. The final modeled shape is expressed as a function of the attractor and control points.

Moreover, it demonstrates the representation of NURBS of any degree as a CIFS automaton and examines the relationships between the number of states and the degree of the NURBS. The paper also discusses the properties of tensor automata generated from curves-automata of different degrees, highlighting the number of stationary states and their implications for the generation of uniform B-spline shapes.

The challenges and solutions for integrating NURBS of higher degree into the framework are discussed, particularly addressing the complexities arising from the neighborhood of vertices needed to compute surfaces.

The paper proposes an approach for handling the complexities associated with higher degree NURBS based on the prior work of Cashman et al., and discusses the generation of subwords to establish and validate the approach.

Overall, the paper serves to demonstrate the integration of NURBS into a CIFS-based CAGD-modeler, expanding the potential applications of CIFS algorithms in computer-aided geometric design.
