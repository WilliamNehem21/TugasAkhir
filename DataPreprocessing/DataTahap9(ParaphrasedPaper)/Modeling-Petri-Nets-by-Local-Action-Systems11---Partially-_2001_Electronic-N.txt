With this encoding, two operations can run simultaneously only if they do not modify the same element, i.e., only if the locations of the processes they represent do not coincide. Therefore, the locations of the marked network can be regarded as assets that can be accessed by only one process at a time. This scenario also applies to elementary networks, and thus contact-free elementary networks can be represented using this approach.
