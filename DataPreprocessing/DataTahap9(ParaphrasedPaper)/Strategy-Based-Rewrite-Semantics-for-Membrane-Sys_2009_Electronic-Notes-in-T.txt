The field of membrane computing investigates distributed and parallel computing models inspired by the structure and functioning of living cells and their organization. These models process collections of symbol-objects in a localized manner, with evolution rules and objects encapsulated into compartments delimited by membranes. Communication between compartments and potentially with the environment plays a crucial role in these systems. The paper discusses the challenges of defining the behavior of these systems and proposes an alternative approach based on rewrite strategies and strategy controllers. It demonstrates that the strategy-based rewrite semantics can effectively capture the maximal parallel rewriting of membrane systems and compares the concurrency degrees of different formalisms using a common modal logic language. The paper outlines a modal logic for membrane systems, introduces strategy-based rewrite semantics, and presents results comparing the concurrency degree of evolution steps in membrane systems with that of strategic rewrite semantics. It also discusses an extension of the strategy language for cooperation rules and concludes by highlighting the preservation of true concurrency by the strategy-based rewrite semantics. The paper provides a partial answer to the question of defining a rewrite semantics for membrane systems and suggests further investigation into the concurrency degree of cooperation actions in more general system structures. The work references related literature on models and logics for true concurrency to place its findings in context.
