The Animalscript algorithm animation language, although highly expressive and versatile, is challenging to edit without support from an editor. To address this issue, we have developed an Eclipse plugin that includes a text editor, an outline, and code assist for editing Animalscript. This plugin is expected to significantly improve the editing process, making it easier and faster. This paper discusses the technical aspects of the development and the resulting plugin.

Animalscript, with its human-readable notation and ease of generation and manual editing, is gradually replacing the built-in ASCII notation as the preferred representation of animal AV content. Since 2008, Animal also includes an integrated display of the BNF-based definition of Animalscript notation and a small text editor for directly entering or modifying Animalscript input. The main target audience for Animal and Animalscript is students and teachers of computer science.

The paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 provides a brief overview of the features offered by the Eclipse IDE. Section 3 outlines the plugin for editing Animalscript code using Eclipse IDE features. Section 4 presents usage examples to illustrate the support for Animalscript provided by the Animalipse plugin. Finally, Section 5 evaluates the plugin and presents areas for further research.

Eclipse, introduced by IBM in 2001 and made open source in 2004, offers a wide range of plugins and extensions for various needs, including different programming languages, version control system front-ends, and workflow and design components. The Eclipse IDE is widely used in computer science courses, making it familiar to our target users.

The Animalipse plugin enforces a waiting interval of at least 2.5 seconds between parsing iterations to prevent unnecessary continuous parsing of the editor contents. The content assist feature creates a list of recommendations based on the internal representation of the script to assist the user in completing the current selection.

Users can generate new Animalscript files inside Animalipse using the built-in creation wizard. The plugin also supports the folding and unfolding of steps to show more details.

In conclusion, the Animalipse Eclipse plugin aims to facilitate the creation, editing, and debugging of Animalscript-based AV content. Its integration into Eclipse is straightforward, and it is designed to be user-friendly, similar to other established Eclipse plugins. This should help users to become more proficient with Animalscript.
