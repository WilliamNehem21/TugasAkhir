This research explores the concept of zero-shot learning, which involves learning to identify a new class that was not seen during the training phase, but for which the attribute values are known. It also discusses the ability to infer the characteristics of an unfamiliar class for which attribute ground truths are not known. The paper proposes a new approach to address the limitations of supervision caused by human factors and the lack of connections in attribute-based class modeling. This approach is based on the incremental visual recognition using relative attributes and involves learning the relative attributes in an unsupervised manner and updating both the attribute space and class models iteratively. The paper outlines three main contributions, including simultaneous learning of attribute space and class models, a bilateral learning paradigm, and the virtual expansion of the training set. Furthermore, it provides an overview of related work, details the proposed approach, and presents experimental evaluations and comparative results. The paper concludes with clear inferences based on the findings.

In addition, the paper discusses the importance of attributes for recognition purposes and presents a relevant image/category-attribute co-occurrence matrix. It also reviews existing literature on relative attributes and their use in supervised and unsupervised settings. The paper discusses various approaches to attribute-based classification and recognition, including the use of deep learning techniques, web data utilization, and the embedding of object recognition problems into attribute learning. Furthermore, it introduces a student-centered learning method that involves interactions between two entities - a student and a teacher - to update attribute space and class models iteratively.

The proposed method is evaluated based on various criteria such as mean accuracy vs. iteration step/number of attributes, and the paper concludes that the unsupervised attributes contribute significantly to recognition performance when learned incrementally and simultaneously with class models, even when achieved using random class orderings without human intervention. Overall, the proposed method outperforms other approaches significantly.
