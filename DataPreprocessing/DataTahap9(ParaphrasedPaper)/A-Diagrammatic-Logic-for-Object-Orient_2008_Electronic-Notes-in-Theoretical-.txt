The paper introduces formal generalized sketches as a graph-based specification format derived from categorical and ordinary first-order logic, tailored to meet the needs of software engineering. Referred to as a modeling language design pattern, it combines mathematical rigor with an aesthetically pleasing graphical representation. The authors discuss the motivation and justification for employing generalized sketches to formalize practical modeling notations, extending the formalism to include dependencies between predicate symbols and introducing new semantic notions based on the idea of instances as typed structures. They demonstrate that this framework aligns with institution theory and is amenable to algebraic manipulations.

When creating software system designs, people often use diagrams or diagrammatic models, which are representations of a modeling language. While the syntax of diagrams is precisely specified in the metamodel, their intended meaning or semantics are often left as intuitive and approximate. The paper aims to address the lack of formal semantics in diagrammatic models used in software modeling by introducing the dp-logic pattern and showing how generalized sketches can naturally fit into this context.

The contents of the paper are structured as follows: Section 2 provides a detailed discussion of the motivation for using classical categorical sketches, the need for modifying them to generalized sketches, and the advantages of introducing dependencies between predicate symbols. Additionally, the authors argue for instances as typed structures (IATS) semantics over indexed semantics. In Section 3, the paper presents two simple examples of modeling with sketches, followed by a discussion on how to specify systems of models/sketches in the institution framework. These sections primarily aim to achieve specific goals.

The authors view the present paper as the starting point for further work in two distinct areas: first, adapting the sketch formalism to formalize modeling languages commonly used in software engineering, particularly in accordance with industrial standards, and exploring its application to behavior modeling. Secondly, they plan to investigate the natural applicability of sketches for addressing practical problems in software engineering.
