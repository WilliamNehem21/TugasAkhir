Due to the current challenges posed by climate change, bicycles are gaining popularity as a mode of transportation for reducing emissions. There is a growing body of research on bicycles, including comparisons of costs with cars and the role of bicycles in urban traffic. One area of interest is the comparison of different gear systems, such as derailleur and internal shifting hub systems. Derailleur systems require more maintenance than internal shifting hubs, which were first introduced in the early 20th century by Archer. These hubs offer advantages such as protection from external factors and easier maintenance, making them particularly suitable for city and tourism bikes. However, for race bikes, derailleur systems are preferred due to their lightweight nature.

While both derailleur and internal shifting hub systems are widely available, single-speed road bicycles are popular in cities for their simplicity and low maintenance. Nevertheless, their limitations become apparent on gradients or empty streets. To address this, automatic internal shifting hubs have been developed, allowing for different transmission ratios while still maintaining ease of use.

Automatic multi-speed internal shifting hubs come in electric and mechanical forms. The electric version uses a controller to compare sensed speed to stored speed ranges and actuates gear shifts accordingly, while the mechanical version utilizes control devices such as centrifugal clutches and sprag clutches to automatically actuate shifts based on the rotation of the hub components.

Although automatic shifting hub solutions are not yet commonplace, efforts are being made to develop them further. One such example is the SRAM Automatix, which offers two gear ratios. In this paper, the authors propose a new shifting hub, the Three-Speed Automatic Internal Shifting Hub (TSAISH), with three available gears as a refinement of the SRAM Automatix. The paper outlines the design and sizing considerations for the TSAISH and compares its performance with that of the SRAM Automatix over a driving cycle.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses the design of the TSAISH, Section 3 addresses the preliminary sizing of the gearing components, Section 4 presents the performance comparison of the TSAISH and SRAM Automatix, and the conclusion summarizes the key findings and characteristics of the TSAISH. The design aims to increase riding flexibility and achieve the same top velocities as the SRAM Automatix. The study also considers the torque and pedaling cadence required for different gear ratios and explores the impact on power transmission.

Overall, the validation demonstrates that the TSAISH offers advantages in terms of riding ease and torque requirements compared to the SRAM Automatix, and highlights the potential benefits of the TSAISH in practical applications.
