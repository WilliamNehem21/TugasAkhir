The process of drug design is both time-consuming and expensive, and often results in high attrition rates. To mitigate these challenges, in silico methods can support drug design by guiding the design process, optimizing compounds, and discarding those with undesired properties at an early stage of development. Computer-aided drug design (CADD) has therefore become integral in the drug discovery pipeline, and is widely utilized in both academic and pharmaceutical research and development.

In CADD, encoding molecular compounds in both human- and computer-readable formats is a crucial step. A common encoding method is the simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES), which provides a linear notation of a molecule based on atom and bond enumeration, as well as branch, ring closure, and disconnection specification. Using SMILES for molecular encoding offers several advantages due to its compact representation.

However, it is important to note that multiple valid SMILES representations can exist for a single molecule, as the choice of starting atom for enumeration and the path followed along the molecular graph can lead to different SMILES notations. While having a unique correspondence between a molecule and its SMILES notation may be desired in certain instances, such as when determining overlapping molecules from different data sets, most cheminformatics tools have their own algorithms for generating canonical SMILES that remain consistent for a given molecular graph.

Augmentation of SMILES data has been shown to improve the performance of deep learning models in various applications, such as quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling. However, existing studies often decide on the augmentation approach and the number of augmentations a priori, without a systematic analysis. This study aims to address this gap by presenting a systematic approach to SMILES data augmentation, considering different augmentation strategies and determining the optimal level of data augmentation.

The study focuses on comparing the performance of deep learning models in the context of SMILES data augmentation. It specifically examines three types of models â€“ 1D and 2D convolutional neural networks (Conv1D, Conv2D), and a recurrent neural network (RNN) with an LSTM layer followed by fully connected layers. The models are trained for 250 epochs with mini-batches of size 16 using stochastic gradient descent and a learning rate of 0.001. The study also explores the use of ensemble learning for molecular prediction based on aggregated SMILES representations.

Furthermore, the study investigates the influence of data augmentation on the performance of deep learning models. Each augmentation strategy is analyzed in relation to the size of the molecules in the data set, and potential biases arising from the under-representation of small molecules in the augmented data set are considered. Additionally, the study explores the application of ensemble learning for molecular prediction, emphasizing the value of aggregating predictions from different SMILES representations to obtain more informative and reliable predictions for compounds.

The study also delves into the potential advantages of retaining duplicate SMILES representations, particularly in capturing inherent symmetry in a compound. Furthermore, the study examines the relationship between high confidence and reduced mean prediction error, as well as the potential significance of the standard deviation associated with SMILES predictions in quantifying the uncertainty of the model's predictions for a given compound.
