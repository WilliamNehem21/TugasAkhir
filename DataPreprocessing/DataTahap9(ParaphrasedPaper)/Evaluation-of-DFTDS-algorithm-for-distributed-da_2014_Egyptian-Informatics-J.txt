The distributed data warehouse is primarily concerned with how data is processed and distinguishes between dynamic and physically distributed systems. Retrieving relevant information from a large database is a laborious and time-consuming process. This challenge is addressed by employing a compact query scheduling process in the distributed data warehouse to expedite these tasks within a few seconds. This paper introduces the dynamic fault-tolerant dependency scheduling (DFTDS) algorithm, which schedules queries based on their dependencies and automatically allocates resources by monitoring the status of virtual machines. The DFTDS algorithm significantly reduces query processing time and memory utilization compared to existing algorithms.

The existing scheduling algorithms are inadequate for retrieving precise information from single repositories, necessitating the development of a new grid scheduling algorithm to access exact data from a distributed data warehouse and facilitate sharing data from various repositories.

The paper combines principles from three existing grid-based algorithms, namely Research on Novel Dynamic Resource Management (RNDRM), New Resource Mechanism with Negotiate Solution (NRMNS), and Virtual Computing Grid using Resource Pooling (VCGRP), to enhance resource management efficiency.

Furthermore, the paper outlines the comparison and analysis of existing grid-based scheduling algorithms in addressing the challenge posed by increasing data fetching operations in distributed data warehouses. The proposed task scheduling algorithm aims to allocate queries to appropriate resources based on query dependency, while the resource scheduling algorithm focuses on status checking and management. The performance of the proposed DFTDS method is evaluated using processing time and memory utilization metrics, as well as scalability, replication metric, error-free execution, and query cost metrics.

The DFTDS algorithm demonstrates lower processing times by automatically creating new virtual machines in case of failure, enabling error rectification within 5 to 10 seconds depending on the size of the retrieved information.

The paper presents an online and non-preemptive DFTDS algorithm for distributed data warehouse environments, which schedules queries based on their dependency and resource status, and recycles virtual machines to avoid failures. The proposed DFTDS algorithm is compared with three scheduling algorithms (WINE, DTDS, and VMFTRS) under various parameters using different sizes of query sets and resource groups. The results show that the proposed DFTDS algorithm outperforms WINE by 20.58% in processing time, 1.25% in memory utilization, 13% in scalability, 3% in error-free execution, 3% in replication metric, and 28% in query cost metrics. Finally, the paper outlines plans to develop an online and preemptive scheduling algorithm for task prediction and resource classification in the future.
