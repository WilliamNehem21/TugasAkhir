We propose the use of an approximate noninterference method for evaluating the security of probabilistic protocols. Our approach involves formalizing the protocol within a probabilistic process algebra framework and defining process similarity based on weak probabilistic bisimulation. We demonstrate this approach with an analysis of a probabilistic nonrepudiation protocol, allowing for a quantitative estimation of its fairness degree.

We introduce probabilities by incorporating probabilistic information into algebraic operators, using a mixed generative-reactive model to represent both probabilistic and nondeterministic behaviors. We define a set of finite state, guarded, and closed terms denoted as processes. The semantics of the calculus are briefly introduced, and we outline the formalization of noninterference where a high-level entity is considered an adversary aiming to maximize information leakage.

In terms of security guarantees, each message conveyed by the protocol includes a timestamp for determining message freshness and protecting against replication attacks. Nonrepudiation of origin is ensured by specific messages, while nonrepudiation of receipt is guaranteed by the final message. We discuss the conditions for preserving fairness within the protocol and address potential vulnerabilities, such as the possibility of a malicious party attempting to manipulate the protocol.

We aim to estimate the probability of violating the nonrepudiation of recipient in the protocol, and model the behavior of the originator to evaluate the effectiveness of the most powerful adversary strategy. Finally, we consider the recipient as a potential adversary and analyze their behavior.
