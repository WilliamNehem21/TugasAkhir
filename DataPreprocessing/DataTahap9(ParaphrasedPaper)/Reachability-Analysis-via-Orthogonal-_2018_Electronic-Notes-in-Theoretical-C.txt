We have developed tools based on abstract interpretation to infer information about the biochemical structure of biomolecular species that may be present in a given model. Previous research has focused on examining the connections between the states of the sites belonging to the same instance of a protein, with a focus on identifying which specific patterns may be reachable during model execution.

Our approach to checking model consistency typically involves combining static analysis and causality analysis. Static analysis provides an approximation of the model's potential behavior without requiring its execution, while causality analysis is used to verify the validity of any unexpected behaviors flagged by static analysis and understand their origins. This allows modelers to make appropriate updates to the model as needed.

In earlier work, we utilized abstract interpretation to formalize static analyses capturing relationships between potential states of sites within the same instance of a protein. In this paper, we extend this approach to a broader family of abstract domains called orthogonal sets of patterns. These sets can be obtained by recursively refining information about a given pattern to partition the occurrences of a specific protein in any mixture. We demonstrate that orthogonal sets of patterns are a convenient choice for designing scalable and accurate static analyses. For example, we use them to derive properties in models involving molecule transport (specifically showing that connected pairs of proteins always belong to the same compartment) and models featuring double binding (demonstrating that a protein of type 'a' bound twice to proteins of type 'b' is necessarily bound twice to the same instance of protein 'b').

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we provide case studies to illustrate the purpose of our analysis. In Section 3, we review the semantics of kappa. In Section 4, we describe a generalized abstraction of bio-molecular mixtures using sets of patterns and introduce the concept of orthogonal sets of patterns. In Section 5, we utilize orthogonal sets of patterns to abstract the set of reachable mixtures in kappa models.

We also describe the graphical representation of instances of these proteins, providing visual depictions of different protein types and their associated sites and states within the model. We illustrate how specific properties of interest, such as protein binding and phosphorylation, can be captured and analyzed using our framework.

In conclusion, our abstract interpretation static analysis framework not only builds on previous work in examining local views but also extends to the detection of properties related to molecule transport and the formation of double bonds between proteins. We have demonstrated the scalability and effectiveness of our approach through its application to two developing models.
