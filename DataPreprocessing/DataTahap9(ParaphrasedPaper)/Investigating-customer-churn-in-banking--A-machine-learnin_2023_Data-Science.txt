Bank customer attrition occurs when customers stop using the bank's services and terminate their relationship with the bank, making customer retention crucial in the highly competitive banking market. Retaining a strong customer base is important not only for maintaining current customers but also for attracting new ones through customer confidence and referrals. Therefore, reducing customer attrition is a critical goal for banks. This study aims to analyze bank data to forecast which users are likely to discontinue using the bank's services and become paying customers using various machine learning algorithms. The research also presents a comparative analysis of different evaluation metrics and develops a data visualization RShiny app to aid in customer churn analysis and management.

The success of any business depends on having a large and loyal customer base, which involves acquiring new customers and retaining existing ones. Retaining customers is particularly crucial for the sustainability of a business model, as lost customers are unlikely to return. This study addresses the importance of maintaining customers and predicting their behaviors to solve the issue of customer attrition. In previous studies, customer relationship management (CRM) systems and various approaches for customer retention have been discussed, providing a foundation for understanding customer dissatisfaction and addressing attrition.

This study contributes to the understanding of customer churn analysis and machine learning in the banking sector in several ways. It presents a comprehensive preprocessing method for ensuring data correctness and consistency in customer churn analysis, evaluates the effectiveness of different machine learning methods in anticipating customer attrition, and offers practical implications and recommendations for banks to improve client retention. Additionally, it introduces different machine learning techniques and applies them to the dataset, focusing on approaches such as logistic regression, support vector machine (SVM), random forest, and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). The development of a data visualization RShiny app further enhances the practical application of churn analysis by providing a user-friendly tool for displaying churn-related insights.

The key findings of this research indicate that the random forest model performed best in terms of accuracy (78.3%) and sensitivity (69.3%), followed by XGBoost with an accuracy of 83.9%. Critical factors influencing customer churn, such as nationality, gender, number of products owned, and account balance, were identified. Moreover, the study emphasizes the importance of understanding customer attrition and provides practical recommendations to improve client retention.

The data visualization RShiny app developed in this study enables stakeholders to make informed decisions by providing comprehensive visualizations of churn trends and customer behavior. The insights derived from this research empower banks to make data-driven decisions and effectively allocate resources to improve customer retention. Furthermore, the implications of this study extend beyond the banking sector and can be applied to a variety of industries, including insurance, telecommunications, subscription-based services, and e-commerce, by using thorough preparation strategies, combining various data, and employing machine learning algorithms to forecast customer churn or other important business outcomes.

In conclusion, the research findings have practical implications for a range of sectors, guiding data-driven decision-making and improving client retention strategies. This study highlights the potential for data-driven decision-making and the optimization of proactive client retention and marketing strategies across various industries.
