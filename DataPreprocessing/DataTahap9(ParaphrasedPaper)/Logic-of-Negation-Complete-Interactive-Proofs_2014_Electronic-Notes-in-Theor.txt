This paper explores a new modal logic of negation-complete and disjunctive interactive proofs (ldiip) within the context of classical normal modal logic of non-monotonic interactive proofs. Additionally, it compares ldiip with an existing modal logic of non-disjunctive and negation-incomplete interactive proofs (liip). The immediate motivation for ldiip stems from the theoretical concept and practical application of a negation-complete variant of interactive proofs, while the broader motivation is to establish a foundation for interactive computation within an intuitionistic framework. This work is also motivated by a programmatic perspective.
