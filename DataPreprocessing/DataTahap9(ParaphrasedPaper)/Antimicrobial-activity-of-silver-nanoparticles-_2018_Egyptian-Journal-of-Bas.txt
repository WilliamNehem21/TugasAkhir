The yeast species Rhodotorula sp. is a unicellular organism with a high growth rate and is identifiable by its yellow, orange, or red color, and is commonly referred to as carotenogenic yeast or pink yeast due to its production of carotenoids. It is widely found in various environments such as soil, fresh water, flowers, sea water, and food.

Numerous studies have emphasized the significance of the Rhodotorula genus in biotechnology and its potential applications in various industries, contradicting the previous notion that Rhodotorula was merely a saprophytic organism. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have unique chemical, optical, electronic, and magnetic properties that differ from those of bulk metals, and their biological synthesis is a high-yield, low-cost, non-toxic, and eco-friendly process that utilizes various biological resources such as plants, bacteria, fungi, yeast, algae, and viruses. Recent research has confirmed the capability of certain Rhodotorula species, such as Rhodotorula minuta and Rhodotorula glutinis, to synthesize metal nanoparticles.

One of the most significant applications of metal nanoparticles, particularly silver nanoparticles, in the field of medicine is their use as antimicrobial agents. The lethal activity of nanoparticles against a broad spectrum of bacteria and fungi has been well documented. This study aimed to explore a new biological source for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles and to assess the microbial biochemical changes and antimicrobial activity of differentially centrifuged silver nanoparticles.

SDS-PAGE was used to investigate the impact of AgNPs collected at different centrifugation speeds (4000 and 14,000 rpm) on selected pathogens, including E. coli, Candida sp., and Bacillus sp. The growth of all pathogens, including both gram-positive bacteria (Streptococcus sp., Bacillus sp., and Staphylococcus sp.) and gram-negative bacteria (Shigella sp., Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella sp.), as well as the fungus Candida sp., was completely inhibited after treatment with all collected AgNPs.

Nanobiotechnology, which involves manipulating materials at the nanoscale for various applications, holds great promise for benefiting humanity. In this study, a strain of Rhodotorula sp. (ATL72), a carotenoid-producing yeast, was isolated from salt marshes near the Mediterranean Sea in Egypt. Morphological and molecular tools were employed for strain identification, and the analysis of its 18S rRNA gene revealed a 40% similarity with Rhodotorula bloemfonteinensis EU075187, suggesting that the isolated strain ATL72 might be a new strain.

The biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles from the isolated strain Rhodotorula sp. ATL72 was achieved using a cell-free water extract approach. The dark brown color of the supernatant indicated the bio-reduction of AgNO3 by the reducing proteins in the water extract of the yeast and other microorganisms. A novel technique based on differential freezing and thawing of samples was utilized to separate metallic nanoparticles from a culture of yeast MKY3. Yeast strains offer several advantages over bacteria in the mass production of nanoparticles due to their ease of manipulation in laboratory conditions and their ability to synthesize numerous enzymes with rapid growth using simple nutrients.

TEM analysis of silver nanoparticles revealed irregular oval or rounded shapes with sizes ranging from 8.8 to 21.4 nm. These nanoparticles exhibited antimicrobial activity against a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria as well as yeast, and their effectiveness was further confirmed by previous extensive studies. The shape of the nanoparticles was found to affect their antimicrobial properties, with triangular-shaped nanoparticles being the most effective.

SDS-PAGE analysis showed qualitative and quantitative changes in the protein profile of Candida sp. and Bacillus sp. after treatment with AgNPs, including the appearance of new bands and increased band intensity, which may be linked to the ability of AgNPs to induce new proteins as a stress response. In the case of E. coli treated with AgNPs, the protein profile remained unchanged, but with reduced band intensities, suggesting that AgNPs may interact with the thiol groups of proteins, causing protein unfolding and potential degradation. Previous studies have reported that AgNPs may also inhibit protein synthesis by impeding translation factors.
