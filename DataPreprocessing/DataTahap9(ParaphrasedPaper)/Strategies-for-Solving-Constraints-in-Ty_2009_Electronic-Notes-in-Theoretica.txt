The authors of this research paper propose a method for declaratively specifying the rules of a type system using constraints. They introduce special combinators in the type rules to specify the order in which constraints may be solved, allowing for flexibility in selecting a solving strategy. This approach bridges the gap between the declarative specification and the deterministic implementation of a type system, resulting in a simpler and more reusable constraint solver. The authors demonstrate the use of these combinators in the development of a real-life compiler.

Furthermore, the paper discusses the challenges of providing sensible feedback for validating program analysis, particularly in the context of security analysis. To address this issue, the authors suggest investigating the common mistakes made by programmers and using that information to construct heuristics that can aid in identifying the most likely source of a mistake. This feedback generation process needs to be tailored to the specific programming language and analysis domain, making it a complex and language-specific task. The authors propose a generic solution for generating feedback that can be easily reused for different analyses or programming languages, with the option of adding domain-specific heuristics later as a refinement.

The paper also presents a framework that enables compiler builders to incorporate the proposed approach. The authors illustrate the use of this framework with an example related to type inferencing in the polymorphic lambda calculus. They emphasize the framework's language and analysis agnostic nature and its implementation as part of the top framework, used in the construction of a real-life compiler â€“ the helium compiler for Haskell.

In addition, the paper outlines the main components and operations of the proposed approach, emphasizing the separation of the type and effect system into declarative specification and solver components. It also discusses the impact of different solving strategies on the constraint solving process and the flexibility provided by the framework to experiment with various constraint solving orders.

The paper concludes by discussing the implications of the proposed approach for soundness proofs in program analysis and its comparison with existing constraint-solving algorithms, highlighting the advantages of the constraint-based approach over previous methods. The authors also mention the potential for developing new combinators to further enhance the flexibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach.
