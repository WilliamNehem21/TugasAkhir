SNPs were selected based on their position in the 5' regulatory region, which often includes the promoter. The SNP g.49520870G>A (rs17483548) in the IRP-2 gene was examined using the restriction fragment length polymorphism-polymerase chain reaction (RFLP-PCR) method as described in previous studies [24,25].
