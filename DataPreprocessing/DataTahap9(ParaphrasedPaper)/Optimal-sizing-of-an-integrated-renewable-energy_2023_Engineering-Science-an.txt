Many people around the world still do not have access to basic energy services, particularly in developing countries. Distributed renewable energy systems have proven to be successful in meeting the electricity demand in these areas, especially in remote rural communities where grid electrification is difficult and expensive. These systems, which rely on renewable energy sources, are undergoing transformation and are becoming more effective and cost-efficient. One challenge with these systems is that excess energy generated during off-peak hours is often wasted, but recent research has suggested that electric vehicles (EVs) could be used to consume this surplus energy. This study aims to develop an optimal model for an integrated renewable energy system (IRES) to electrify a specific area, and to effectively utilize surplus energy in standalone IRES by deploying EVs as a means of consuming excess energy and reducing energy costs.

Several studies have investigated the optimal sizing of IRES from various perspectives. For example, researchers have examined the use of solar photovoltaic (PV) and battery-based systems to meet electricity needs in grid-connected and off-grid settings, and have found that significant amounts of surplus energy can be transferred to the grid or used as a dump load. Additionally, the integration of EVs in power systems has received attention in recent literature, with studies examining the impacts of EVs on system performance and their potential role in consuming surplus energy.

The cost of storage, particularly batteries, is a significant concern in IRES due to the mismatch between renewable generation and demand, and surplus renewable generation often needs to be discarded to maintain system stability. Furthermore, there is a lack of research on the charging of EVs in 100% renewable energy-based standalone IRES.

The study also considers the annual maintenance cost (AMC) of IRES components and explores the optimization of the system using the novel chimp optimization algorithm (CHOA). The findings of the study highlight the potential of EVs as a means of consuming surplus energy and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in microgrid systems, and suggest that intelligent charging strategies can be effective in maximizing surplus energy utilization and enhancing EV penetration while minimizing the cost of energy.
