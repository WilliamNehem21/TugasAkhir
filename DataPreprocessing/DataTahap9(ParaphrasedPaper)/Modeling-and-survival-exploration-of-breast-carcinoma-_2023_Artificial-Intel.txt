The primary aim of this study is to characterize the behavior of the distribution by using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) to estimate its parameters and to identify the optimal artificial neural network (ANN) method by comparing it with MLE, applied to real data on breast cancer patients to assess survival, risk, and other survival study functions of the log-logistic distribution. The parameters were defined in the input layer of the ANN developed for the purpose of survival analysis, and various survival study functions were obtained in the output layer. The results indicate that the risk function increases with the duration of infection before decreasing for the group of breast cancer patients under study, aligning with the theoretical properties of the log-logistic distribution. Furthermore, the practical conclusions of the survival analysis correspond to the theoretical properties of the log-logistic distribution. The study also highlights the effectiveness of ANN in predicting vital parameters, particularly the survival of cancer patients, due to its high predictive capabilities.

In the domain of survival analysis, researchers have focused on analyzing hazard functions of survival data using statistical methods and mathematical tools. To address the complexity of the survival data, multilayer perceptron models and maximum likelihood estimation have been employed in various studies. These methodologies have been utilized to estimate mortality rates in diverse contexts, such as breast cancer and COVID-19, and to predict survival in bladder cancer patients. The research aims to bridge a significant gap in the existing literature by investigating and optimizing the reliability of lifetime models using the ANN model and MLE.

Survival analysis has become increasingly significant in fields such as medicine, biology, social sciences, econometrics, and engineering, particularly in investigating events occurring over extended periods. The survival time, defined as the period between a specific starting point and a terminal event, is crucial information in these studies. The study uses the log-logistic distribution to model survival data and aims to investigate the metric analysis of the probability survival model through MLE and ANN, contributing to the advancement of survival evaluation methods.
