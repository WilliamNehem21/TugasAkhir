There has been a recent surge in interest in the categorical axiomatization of differential structures. For instance, there has been work on forward differentiation, reverse differentiation, and tangent structures. A fundamental question in this area is whether the chosen axioms are appropriate. The authors have demonstrated that these axioms hold in natural structures, such as Cartesian differential categories, where they are applicable to the category of finite powers of the reals and smooth functions. Thus, in this sense, the axioms are correct. However, a further question arises as to whether they are complete, i.e., whether there are any missing axioms.

To address completeness, we make use of an interpolation theorem, specifically Severi's well-known theorem on the solvability of Hermite interpolation problems. Hermite interpolation is an extension of Lagrange interpolation, where in addition to seeking a real polynomial that takes prescribed values at prescribed points, multivariate Hermite interpolation involves prescribing values of (possibly higher-order) partial derivatives.

In our treatment of the theory of partial differentiation, we utilize a specific notion of function, namely smooth functions over the reals. However, for the general theory of second-order logic, a more abstract and thus more general notion of function is required. This can be formulated in various ways, such as in terms of abstract clones, Lawvere theories, or more conceptually, in terms of monoids in a presheaf category of contexts (see [8,6,7]).
