The ieee 802.11 standard offers fair access to the transmission medium, but this shared channel exposes networks to vulnerabilities such as jamming, black holes, and mac layer misbehavior. Our paper is structured as follows: the second section presents the architecture of ieee 802.11, while the third section provides an overview of research on mac layer misbehavior. In the fourth section, we propose a detection scheme for mac layer misbehavior, specifically targeting greedy node behaviors. The fifth section evaluates the performance of our approach using the ns2 simulator, and the concluding section offers perspectives on the findings.

The ieee 802.11 mac layer employs the carrier sense multiple access/collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) access method, wherein a node listens to the medium before transmitting to avoid collisions. Other research has suggested extending the 802.11 standard to incorporate a random backoff protocol using a coin flipping technique. However, this approach does not address collisions between the sender and receiver.

Our work introduces a model of an 802.11 network with mac layer misbehavior attacks, specifically targeting greedy nodes that modify the backoff timer. The proposed detection scheme aims to identify these misbehaving nodes by monitoring average reception throughput and mean inter-packet time using control charts. The detection thresholds and tolerance intervals are adjusted based on the number of nodes, and statistically-based process control is employed to distinguish between ordinary and extraordinary situations.

Our study tested the detection scheme in an idealized environment with constant bit rate traffic, demonstrating the efficacy of statistical process control for detecting deviations in any environment, whether theoretical or realistic.
