This study conducts a factorial analysis on the tensile strength of a composite material made from coir fibers. Three key parameters under investigation are the volume fraction of fibers, curing time, and the amount of compression load applied during the fabrication process. The experimental design follows a full-factorial approach, resulting in a total of 18 tensile test cases. The analysis of variance on the test data indicates that the volume fraction of coir fibers and the interaction between curing time and fiber volume are the primary factors affecting the tensile strength of the composite. Conversely, the influence of compression loading during fabrication appears to be negligible.

The abundance of coconuts in tropical countries such as Malaysia makes them a sustainable source of natural fibers for composites. Various parts of the coconut fruit, including the shell and husk fibers (coir fiber), have been utilized in composite materials for applications such as building materials and household appliances. Coir fiber composites have also been investigated for potential use in aerospace applications.

Similar to other materials, the selection and use of coir fiber-reinforced epoxy composites depend on their mechanical properties, which are influenced by factors such as fiber and matrix behavior, volume fraction, fiber distribution, orientation, and fabrication process parameters. This research aims to evaluate the impact of these factors on the tensile properties of a coir fiber composite produced using the compression molding method.

The coir fibers used in the study are commercially available and come in the form of custom-made sheets with random fiber orientation. No treatment is applied to the fibers during the fabrication of test specimens. It is noted that the industrial processing of these fibers, such as the partial retting process used in producing mattresses, may alter their physical properties, potentially leading to deviations from established properties of natural coir fibers.

The factorial effects of coir fiber volume, curing time, and compression load on the tensile strength of the composite material are analyzed. The results from the analysis of variance suggest that the volume fraction of coir fibers has the greatest influence on the tensile strength of the composite. Moreover, the effects of curing time, particularly in combination with fiber volume, are also significant and must be considered in the fabrication process. In contrast, the effects of compression load appear to be relatively insignificant, although further investigation may be needed to quantify the extent to which compression loading affects the tensile strength.
