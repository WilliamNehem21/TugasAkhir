This paper presents a novel method for accurately determining the optimal size of fine grinding media. Comparative grinding tests were conducted using both cast iron segments and steel balls, with the results indicating that the mill capacity and grinding efficiency of cast iron segments were significantly superior to those of steel balls. Furthermore, the use of optimized fine grinding media resulted in noticeable improvements in grinding and flotation indexes during industrial experiments.

The size of the steel balls used in fine grinding is a critical factor, as oversizing can lead to excessive crushing force and penetrability crushing, while undersizing can result in reduced fineness of the ore. To address this, it is essential to precisely determine the fine grinding medium in order to apply an accurate crushing force to improve grinding efficiency. However, in practice, many concentrators tend to use oversized fine grinding media, which has become an increasingly serious issue.

Following industrial testing, the yield of P2O5 concentrate increased by 2.29 percent, and the recovery of P2O5 concentrate increased by 2.39 percent. These improvements were largely attributed to the optimization of the grinding product size composition and the enhancement of mineral liberation degree achieved through the use of fine grinding media. The application of a selective grinding process has led to overall improvements in the grinding and flotation indexes.

While steel balls have traditionally been the preferred fine grinding medium, they are not necessarily the most effective option. The cast iron segment, for example, offers a larger grinding area and better turning capabilities, resulting in superior fine grinding effects compared to steel balls. Moreover, the fine grinding process relies mainly on grinding and is supported by minimal impact, making cast iron an ideal material for fine grinding media due to its wear resistance and cost-efficiency.
