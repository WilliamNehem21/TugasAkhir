This illustration presents type-preserving transformations of object-language programs through syntax-to-syntax conversions. Substitution, a transformation we will focus on in the following sections, is an example of such a process. Additionally, an accurate substitution implementation can be leveraged to create additional syntax-to-syntax transformations. To demonstrate this, we will outline an implementation of big-step semantics based on substitution.
