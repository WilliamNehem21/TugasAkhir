The effectiveness of mobile applications for delivering asthma self-management programs has been gaining support from both patients and healthcare professionals in recent years. Big data analytics using machine learning methods have enabled the implementation of early predictors for the risk of developing exacerbations. However, existing prediction approaches often focus on identifying who is at risk of developing an exacerbation, rather than when it might occur, and do not provide short-term personalized predictions of asthma control status to guide personalized patient care and reduce exacerbation risk.

This paper presents the design aspects and initial implementation of a personalized decision support system for the MyAirCoach platform. The system proposes a novel multi-model approach for short-term prediction of asthma control status, offering flexibility in considering various clinical parameters for rule-based decision support and personalized patient guidance. The paper is organized into sections that provide an overview of the MyAirCoach decision support system, details on the proposed short-term prediction approach, the machine learning algorithms used, the dataset and experimental setup, as well as annotation and pre-processing steps. The results section presents findings related to the short-term prediction of asthma control based on the Asthma Control Diary (ACD) and a multi-parameter personalized short-term prediction. The paper concludes with a discussion of the study's limitations, future work, and the study's implications.

The focus of the decision support system implemented in the MyAirCoach platform is to optimize and personalize short-term prediction of asthma control, taking into account established home monitoring procedures and measurements in order to increase daily asthma control through well-targeted self-management and personalized interventions. The system aims to extract important information for patients and medical professionals, employing machine learning algorithms to train personalized classification models for short-term prediction of asthma control level and long-term prediction of exacerbation risks. Daily and real-time personalized patient advices and notifications are generated by rule-based decision support modules, and communicated through the patient mobile application and alerts for medical personnel.

The ACD is a widely used tool for monitoring asthma control and is sensitive to changes in symptom control. An additional annotation approach is explored to account for clinical significance and patient variability, beyond the standard ACD-based approach. For the current study, four classification algorithms - support vector machines (SVM), random forests, Adaboost, and Bayesian network - were selected for evaluation. These algorithms were chosen based on their demonstrated performance in various application domains and specific performance in predicting asthma exacerbations.

The study used a dataset of 76 patients, involving daily assessments of asthma control using various tools such as the ACD, spirometry, and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) measurements. Despite consistency issues in the data collection process, the statistical analysis was conducted using the R language and implemented functions for the evaluation of the classification results of each algorithm through 10-fold cross validation.

The classifiers were extensively tested using only ACD measurements, and the random forests algorithm demonstrated the highest accuracy of 80.41%, particularly when using consistent data collection and the modified ACD annotation rule for establishing output asthma control classes. Overall, SVM and random forests algorithms outperformed Adaboost and Bayesian network algorithms for the ACD-based short-term prediction task. However, the accuracy of all algorithms decreased slightly when inconsistent data collection was included in the training data.

In conclusion, the personalized decision support system presented in this paper aims to improve the short-term prediction of asthma control status and provide personalized guidance for optimal self-management of asthma. The study's findings highlight the potential of the multi-model approach in enhancing personalized predictions and decision support for asthma management.
