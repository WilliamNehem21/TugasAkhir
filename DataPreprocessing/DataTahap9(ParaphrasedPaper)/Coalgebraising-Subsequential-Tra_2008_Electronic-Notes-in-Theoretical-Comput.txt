The result in theorem 4.19 indicates that it is possible to obtain a minimal coalg(d)-representation of a step-by-step t by taking the quotient of dif(t) with d-bisimilarity. This approach could offer an interesting alternative to the process of determining the minimal realization of [t] through normalization and then taking the quotient of n(t) with s-bisimilarity. It is important to note that an actual implementation of a step-by-step t should be based on the minimal realization of [t], as the output generated by dif(t) would need to be reduced in the free group to capture the behavior. An example is provided to illustrate the distinction between the two types of minimal realizations.
