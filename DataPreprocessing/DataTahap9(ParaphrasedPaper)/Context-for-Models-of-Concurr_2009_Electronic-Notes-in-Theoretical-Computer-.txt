Several topological models are utilized to analyze concurrency, including precubical complexes, d-spaces, local po-spaces, and flow. Each of these categories offers a model that captures the relevant computer-scientific properties of a given concurrent system.

On a local level, advancements have been made in reducing the path space of a given model through directed homotopies of paths and the fundamental category. On a global scale, one approach is to transition to the component category. This paper introduces another global approach, which aligns with the model categorical approach and may be more geometric in nature.

The category pospace encompasses all small limits and colimits, but it is too restrictive for modeling many concurrent systems (e.g., pospaces cannot contain loops). While all provided examples are in pospace, a more suitable framework for concurrency is the category lopospc of local pospaces. A local pospace is a topological space in which each point has a neighborhood that is a pospace, and these local orders are compatible.

However, lopospc does not contain all small colimits, unlike pospace. Nevertheless, there exists a formal method of expanding a category to one with all small limits and colimits. Furthermore, this larger category has a canonical model structure. For details on the application of this theory to lopospc, refer to the appendix, which provides a more precise version of the relevant theorem (theorem b.4).

Example 5.5 involves the specification of marked points a, b, c, b', and c' with conditions similar to the previous example. Additionally, d' is defined as the space resulting from attaching c along its bottom edge to the top edge of b.
