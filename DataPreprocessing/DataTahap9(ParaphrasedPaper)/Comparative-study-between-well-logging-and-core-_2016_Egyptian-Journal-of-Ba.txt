This study serves as an extension of prior research efforts and aims to examine the petrophysical properties of the Hawaz formation in the H oil field. The primary focus of this study entails a rapid assessment of log curves and the generation of crossplots correlating petrophysical parameters, as well as a comparison of the findings with core data. The data utilized in this research includes geological information presented in composite logs, as well as well logging data encompassing resistivity, sonic, neutron, density, spontaneous potential, caliper, gamma ray, and natural gamma ray spectrometry logs, all of which were obtained from Repsol Oil.

The petroleum system within the H field is characterized by a structural Hawaz paleo-high that formed subsequent to the Hawaz erosional event. The principal regional seal is attributed to the Silurian Tanezzuft shale formation, with the basal Tanezzuft hot shale member serving as the primary source rock in the study area. The Hawaz formation, of Middle Ordovician age, is identified as the primary reservoir, and it is informally segmented into eight horizons designated as H1 to H8, some of which have been further divided into sub-units. Each horizon is distinguished by its unique petrophysical properties.
