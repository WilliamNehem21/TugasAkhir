This portion of the paper explores the scenario that arises from a monoidal v-category equipped with finite biproducts. Building on the findings of the previous two sections, we establish that such a category can be viewed as both a cmon(v)-category and an act(v)-category. By appropriately applying distributivity, we demonstrate that it can also be regarded as a category enriched over semimodules.

The argument presented here is credited to Hilton and Eckmann, but it is also referenced in [15, exercise ii.5.5], where it was proven for the case when c = set. It asserts that when an object possesses two monoid structures and the multiplication map of one is a monoid homomorphism with regard to the other, the two monoid structures coincide and are indeed commutative.
