The identity functions in the category CRPos are immediately seen to be r-continuous (r-monotone), and the composition of r-continuous (r-monotone) functions yields an r-continuous (r-monotone) function. The category CRPos has r-complete r-posets as its objects and r-continuous functions as its morphisms. Meanwhile, the category CRPosr consists of r-complete r-posets that preserve pre-orders in r as objects and r-continuous functions as morphisms.
