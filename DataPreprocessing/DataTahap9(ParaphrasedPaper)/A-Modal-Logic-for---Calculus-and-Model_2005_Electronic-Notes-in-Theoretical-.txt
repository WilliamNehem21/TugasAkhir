Now, we aim to establish significant findings regarding the properties of logical formulas, which are crucial for the model checking algorithm. Subsequently, we employ transposition as a valuable tool to present succinct proofs of properties related to fresh names. Due to space constraints, most of the detailed proofs have been omitted. For further elaboration, we direct the reader to the complete version of this paper. The subsequent definition expands the concept of transposition to predicates.

(including both free and bound names) present in the nodes of g, and na represents the count of names and name variables found in a. It is worth noting that the names in the tag set of the formula are not included, as they solely serve as a form of record-keeping. The following lemma is noteworthy, as it allows us to conclude that, provided each term only appears once in each tag set (as is the case in our algorithm), the size of the tag set is limited since the STG under consideration is finite.
