The community Pan, which focused on text-based tasks, began incorporating Arabic into their dataset for gender identification (GI) tasks in 2017. However, the approaches studied in Pan's GI tasks were not tailored specifically for the Arabic language, and the proposed solutions yielded low accuracy rates for GI. Furthermore, there is a lack of research targeting GI for the Egyptian dialect. Previous work on GI has explored various approaches.

Hussein et al. introduced a classical machine learning approach to the GI problem with a focus on the Egyptian dialect. The authors extracted gender features from text as semantic features and developed a model that used a mixed feature vector combining embedding vector representation and semantic features with a random forest classifier, as well as an n-gram feature vector with a logistic regression classifier. This model achieved an accuracy of 87.6% for the GI problem using a labeled dataset obtained from Egyptian dialect tweets on Twitter.

Kodiyan et al. investigated gender detection for multiple languages with different dialects, including English, Spanish, Portuguese, and Arabic. They explored the effectiveness of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and bidirectional recurrent neural networks (RNN) with GRU, finding that RNN with GRU outperformed CNN in terms of accuracy. As a result, they achieved GI accuracies of 79.03%, 72.57%, 79.5%, and 71.58% for English, Spanish, Portuguese, and Arabic, respectively.

Miura et al. proposed a model for word and character embedding, utilizing RNN for word embedding and CNN for character embedding, along with multiple attention layers. They initialized the embedding layer using a model trained on a Twitter dataset and achieved an average accuracy of 79.17% for dialectical Arabic in the GI task.

Additionally, deep learning has demonstrated success in various natural language processing (NLP) problems with different models and architectures. The authors proposed neural network (NN)-based models to address the GI problem, starting with simple NN models and gradually incorporating more complex architectures to improve GI accuracy. They fine-tuned the parameters for each NN architecture to optimize GI accuracy.

The authors also introduced a modified version of the LSTM layer called GRU, which consists of two gates—reset gate and update gate—using sigmoid as the recurrent activation for the gates and scaled exponential linear unit (SELU) as the activation function for the states.

Furthermore, the authors presented a model of a simple artificial neural network (ANN) architecture with fully connected layers, an embedding layer, and bidirectional GRU layers. They optimized the architecture through experiments to achieve the highest GI accuracy. The results showed that the model achieved a GI accuracy in the range of 70.1%+/-0.3%.

Finally, the authors extended the potential directions of research in this field, suggesting the exploration of images posted by each account and the inclusion of language-specific features, such as the usage of female suffixes and prefixes, in the input vectors for NN models targeting GI.
