In the first example, there is only communication, but in the next two examples, both mobility and communication occur. A detailed examination shows that example (2) and example (4) involve distinct types of mobility, which we label as one-dimensional mobility and two-dimensional mobility, respectively. In example (2), all locations are consistently on the same level, with no nesting of locations permitted. In contrast, in example (4), ambient n becomes a subambient of m after moving.
