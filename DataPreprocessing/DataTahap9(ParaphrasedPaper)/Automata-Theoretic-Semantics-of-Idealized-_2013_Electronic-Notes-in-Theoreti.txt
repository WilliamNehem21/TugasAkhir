This paper's main contribution is to present a denotational model for an idealized version of Algol that effectively represents passivity while being extensional, meaning that passive expressions do not produce any side effects, even temporarily. The paper accomplishes this for a language without divergence and demonstrates that the approach can be extended to handle divergence as well. Previous models of passivity relied on the presence of divergence, but the paper's treatment successfully separates the issues of passivity and divergence.

The paper establishes a reflexive graph of categories with four components: store shapes, morphisms between store shapes, logical relations between store shapes, and squares between them. These components satisfy additional axioms to form a parametricity graph, and the formal definitions describing this structure can be found in the appendix.

In recent work, Ahmed, Dreyer, and their colleagues have explored ideas related to possible worlds and automata-theoretic reasoning in the context of operational reasoning. While these ideas appear similar in intuition, making a formal comparison is challenging due to the differing starting points of denotational and operational approaches. These researchers have not yet addressed the issues of passivity in their approaches.

This paper may also pave the way for a semantic understanding of passivity in various specification and verification frameworks, such as program specification systems, ownership type systems, and fractional permission-based methods. Additionally, the successful modeling of passivity brings us closer to modeling program logics like syntactic control of interference, specification logic, and separation logic. The model presented in this paper is expected to facilitate the semantic treatment of such programming logics.
