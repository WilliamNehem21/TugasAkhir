This paper presents a novel approach, called galois power-of-two (gpow2) real-time embedding scheme, that is designed to enhance the performance and accuracy of downstream natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The gpow2 method computes embeddings on the fly in real time within the context of target NLP tasks, eliminating the need for precomputed embeddings. Notably, it is capable of capturing multi-level embeddings in a single pass, simultaneously computing character, word, and sentence embeddings. The paper illustrates how integrating gpow2 into the SWAM Arabic morphological engine, a pattern-oriented algorithm that supports various NLP tasks, has led to improvements in the accuracy of part-of-speech (POS) tagging and pattern matching, resulting in enhanced overall engine performance.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces the main problem, while Section 3 provides a literature review. Section 4 introduces the gpow2 reversible text transformation and explains its operation, and Section 5 details how gpow2 embeddings are directly integrated into neural models for predicting NLP targets. The results of experimentation and findings are discussed in Section 6, followed by a detailed example illustrating the model's operation in Section 7. Section 8 demonstrates how the proposed neural model significantly enhances the performance of traditional SWAM, and the conclusions and recommendations are presented in the final section.

The paper also provides an overview of the evolution of word embeddings, tracing the development of distributional semantics and word embedding techniques, including the milestone contributions of Bengio, Collobert and Weston, and Mikolov. Furthermore, it discusses how gpow2 has been successfully applied to address a real-life problem in Arabic morphology, significantly improving the time performance of SWAM while maintaining high accuracy.

Overall, the gpow2 approach shows promise for enhancing NLP tasks, particularly in the context of Arabic morphological analysis. The paper concludes by highlighting the need for further research and development to fully realize the potential of the gpow2 model across a broader range of applications.
