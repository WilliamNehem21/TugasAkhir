In summary, the use of wireless networks presents numerous quantitative challenges that need to be addressed in computational modeling. Current approaches tend to examine these challenges independently within mathematical frameworks that reflect the physical characteristics of devices and the external environment, particularly with regards to routing algorithms. However, there is currently a lack of a unified formal framework to express and address these issues.

Graph-based techniques, such as graph rewriting with edge replacement and synchronization, have been proposed as a means to model inter-networking systems. These techniques use edges to represent system components and nodes to represent synchronization ports, with the aim of establishing synchronization between interconnected components and exploiting operational semantics to modify graphs.

Furthermore, the application of graph-based techniques, particularly synchronised hyperedge replacement (SHR), has been suggested to model computations in wireless networks and account for the physical environment. Although not addressing wireless protocol design, this approach may also provide insights for designers in specifying protocols accurately.

The structure of the paper involves a discussion of difficulties faced by traditional models of distributed computations in the context of wireless communications, as well as the formal definition of SHR and its operational interpretation. The paper also introduces productions for wireless devices and addresses the challenge of modeling wireless communication in a formalized manner.

To address the challenge of modeling wireless communication formally, SHR is based on graph rewriting combined with constraint solving, which involves the coordinated application of productions to propagate synchronization throughout the graph. Additionally, the paper discusses the propagation of signals and the characteristics of devices, and presents formal representations for these elements in the context of wireless networks.

The paper also highlights the limitations of traditional addressing mechanisms in wireless communication systems, particularly in terms of the implicit assumption that addresses contain information on the position of remote resources. This assumption poses a significant challenge for formal modeling of wireless communication systems.

Overall, the paper presents an approach to address the challenges associated with wireless networks through the use of graph-based techniques and formal computational modeling, while also acknowledging the existing limitations in this area.
