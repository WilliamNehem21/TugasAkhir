This academic paper advocates for the use of complete examples to demonstrate the functionality of a new language. The paper focuses on introducing the mobile maude language, an extension of maude that facilitates mobile computation. The authors showcase the language's capabilities through the implementation of a conference reviewing system, a challenging wide area application according to Cardelli. The paper emphasizes the increasing significance of the network as a platform for developing cost-effective, mission-critical applications in the era of the internet. It discusses the potential of emerging technologies such as mobile code and mobile agents in simplifying the design, implementation, and maintenance of distributed systems, aiming to reduce network traffic and latency while enhancing system robustness and fault tolerance.

Section 2 details the mobile maude language, while Section 3 provides an in-depth description of the conference reviewing system and its implementation using mobile maude. The paper also explores related work in Section 4 and offers conclusions and future directions in Section 5.

The mobile maude language employs various communication mechanisms between objects, including synchronous and asynchronous communication within the same mobile object and communication between objects in different mobile objects. The paper presents the mobile maude primitives used in the conference reviewing system, such as the "go" and "go-find" messages, which enable mobile objects to move between processes and locate specific objects within the system. The system's architecture includes program chair objects responsible for managing submissions and assigning them to committee members, while review forms facilitate the review process by tracking reviewers and handling disagreement resolution. Additionally, the paper describes encryption and the management of submission and reviewing information, and outlines the transformation of report forms into final submission forms.

Moreover, the paper discusses the similarities between the proposed solution and another approach based on active (mobile) documents and the pagespace architecture. This architecture employs a coordination language with mobility capabilities and draws inspiration from the multi-user dungeon (MUD) metaphor, reflecting similar concepts of processes and mobile objects within the conference reviewing system.

In summary, the paper presents an in-depth exploration of the mobile maude language and its application in the development of a conference reviewing system, addressing the challenges of distributed systems and mobile computation while drawing parallels with related architectural concepts.
