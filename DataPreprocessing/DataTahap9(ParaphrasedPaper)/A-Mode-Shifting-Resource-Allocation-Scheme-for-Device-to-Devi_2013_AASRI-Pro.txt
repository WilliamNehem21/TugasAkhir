The use of device-to-device (D2D) communication alongside a cellular network is a promising method recently suggested for supporting localized services, with the potential to enhance system capacity by enabling cellular users and D2D pairs to share the same resource blocks simultaneously. However, the mutual interference resulting from improper resource reuse can lead to performance degradation of the entire system. This paper introduces a mode shifting resource allocation approach that does not rely on channel state information (CSI) of the D2D link or the link between D2D users and cellular users. The proposed scheme aims to mitigate interference and enhance system capacity. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme over a reference scheme in terms of system capacity and cellular link outage probability, without introducing additional complexity.

This paper does not seek to alter power allocation or other relevant protocols within the original LTE network. Instead, the focus is on leveraging differences in CSI when D2D transmitters occupy different resource blocks, and proposing a resource allocation scheme that separately enhances signal quality or reduces interference. Based on the CSI of cellular users and the CSI of D2D transmitters to the base station, the system selects the resource allocation mode with greater capacity. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 outlines the basic model of D2D communication within LTE networks, Section 3 presents the detailed proposed resource allocation mechanism, Section 4 provides numerical results, and the final section presents the conclusion.

The proposed scheme in this paper selects the best several resource blocks of cellular users and assigns them to D2D pairs in descending order, taking into account the channel gain from the cellular user to the base station. Cellular users with higher channel coefficients are capable of sharing resource blocks with D2D pairs. For each selected resource block, the D2D pair with the lowest channel gain between its transmitter and the base station will reuse it, aiming to maximize the given expression.

The proposed scheme not only allocates the best resource blocks for cellular users, but also focuses on the worst resource block for D2D users in the links between D2D transmitters and the base station to manage interference. This complements the reference scheme without introducing additional complexity. The scheme is structured in three steps.
