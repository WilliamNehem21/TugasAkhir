Demonstration. Assuming Alice is the first to make a move and assigns the color 1 to vertex r in the greedy game, then Bob can subsequently color vertex t2 with the color 1. This prevents vertices s and t from being colored 1, allowing Bob to then obligate either t1 or t3 to be colored with 4 by coloring one of the two black vertices with color 1 on his next turn.

Now, if Alice is the first to play and colors vertex s with color 1, then none of the vertices in the set {r1, r2, r3, t1, t2, t3} can be colored with 1. Consequently, all black vertices will be assigned the color 1 in the greedy game coloring strategy. As a result, all vertices in the set {r1, r2, r3, t1, t2, t3} can be colored with either 2 or 3 during the game. Additionally, Alice can utilize the colors 2 and 3 to color r and t on her second and third turns, thereby securing a victory in the game.
