A novel software tool utilizing Taguchi methods has been developed and assessed. The tool involves two distinct trials: the first trial focuses on identifying critical control factors and their optimal ranges, while the second trial aims to determine the best combination of these factors through a more detailed investigation using only the significant control factors. The experimental evaluation specifically examines the optimal cooling system conditions for cutting. The findings indicate that (1) the innovative tool based on Taguchi methods proves to be effective for prompt and cost-efficient development, and (2) it enables swift and accurate determination of the optimal cooling conditions.

In the second trial, the control factors are assessed to identify significant and insignificant ones, with detailed comments provided. During this stage, the maximum, intermediate, and minimum values for each lever of the control factors are explored to encompass all potential scenarios. Subsequently, the second trial focuses on determining the optimal combination of control factors through a thorough investigation using only the significant factors. The ultimate goal is to identify the best combination utilizing the optimal levels of each control factor, with a specific emphasis on assessing the best cooling system conditions for cutting in the experimental setup.
