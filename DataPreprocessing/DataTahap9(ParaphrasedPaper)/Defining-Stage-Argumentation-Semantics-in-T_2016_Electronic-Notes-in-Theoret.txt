We introduce a novel logic programming semantics using abducible atoms, which serves to describe the stage extensions of an argumentation framework (AF) through an associated normal program (PAF). Additionally, we establish the stage semantics for a specific type of normal program and provide a similar characterization. In this section, we provide an overview of the theoretical concepts surrounding logic programming and argumentation semantics. Following previous work [4,8], we establish the connection between a particular argumentation semantics of an argumentation framework and a semantics defined on the normal logic program associated with the framework. We begin by presenting the essential definitions and key points concerning logic programming semantics and argumentation semantics. Furthermore, we demonstrate that {d(a), d(c)} is the unique stage model of PAF, as m={d(a), d(c)} is minimal with respect to set inclusion in terms of facts((PAF)m). Consequently, based on Theorem 2.10, {b, d} is the sole stage extension of AF, which aligns with the outcome demonstrated in Example 2.6.
