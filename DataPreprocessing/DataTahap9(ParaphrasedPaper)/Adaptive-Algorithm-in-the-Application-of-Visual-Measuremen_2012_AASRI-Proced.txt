The issue addressed in this research is the presence of noise in both input and output signals of visual measurement systems, which leads to larger errors when using classic least mean square or recursive least square algorithms for calculation. Direct calculations are also complex and time-consuming. To address this, the proposed solution focuses on deriving a weight vector that serves as an optimal approximation of the Rayleigh quotient of the input vector's self-correlation matrix. This involves iteration estimation and establishing a functional relationship between step factor and error. Simulation analysis experiments demonstrate that the proposed adaptive total least squares algorithm achieves a standard tolerance of 0.0375mm, surpassing the 0.0598mm tolerance of the normal total least squares algorithm in terms of precision and computational efficiency.

When the error exists in both vectors, the least squares estimation may not be optimal, prompting the use of the total least squares algorithm (TLS). However, traditional TLS algorithms are typically batch-based and computationally complex, especially when dealing with large datasets. To address this, numerous researchers have explored alternative approaches, such as least squares support vector machine classifiers, robustization of learning methods for RBF networks, and robust partial least squares regression. In this context, the proposed method focuses on developing a recursive formula for the step length in the TLS algorithm based on the gradient of the cost function.

The experiments involved the measurement of the coordinates of optical characteristic points by coordinate measuring machines (CMMs) and the calculation of the attitude of these points using both normal and adaptive total least squares algorithms. The results indicated that the adaptive total least squares algorithm achieved a standard tolerance of 0.0375mm, outperforming the 0.0598mm tolerance of the normal total least squares algorithm.
