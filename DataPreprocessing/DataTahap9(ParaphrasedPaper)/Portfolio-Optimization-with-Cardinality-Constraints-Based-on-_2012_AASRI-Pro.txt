The paper investigates a model for optimal portfolio selection with constraints on the number of assets, using the minimization of value-at-risk as the objective function. The authors propose a hybrid differential evolution algorithm to solve the model and conduct a case study using sixteen alternative stocks from the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets. The numerical results demonstrate the reasonableness of the model and the effectiveness of the algorithm.

The increasing financial risks since the 1970s, attributed to economic globalization, rapid developments in modern information technology, and financial system innovation, have led to a growing emphasis on effective risk management within the financial industry. Consequently, the measurement of risks has become a key area of research.

To ensure the practicality of the solution, we employed a differential evolution algorithm to solve the problem and obtain reasonable results. The numerical findings confirm the reasonableness of the model and the effectiveness of the hybrid algorithm. Therefore, this paper presents an efficient method for optimizing portfolios with constraints on the number of assets.

In Step 8, if the number of non-zero elements in the trial solution falls outside the range specified by k1 and k2, a new trial is generated based on the algorithm's earlier steps. The process also involves checking if the elements of the trial solution fall within the boundaries of l and u.

For return thresholds ranging from 0.018 to 0.026, an increase in the threshold leads to higher levels of risk, consistent with the high-risk, high-reward principle. When investment becomes concentrated in a few stocks, it deviates from the strategy of diversifying risk, resulting in higher potential losses.
