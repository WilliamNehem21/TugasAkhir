The paper discusses the process of topic detection, which involves identifying topics from a collection of textual data. One of the methods for topic detection is clustering-based, which assumes that the centroids obtained from clustering represent the topics. This method is advantageous in that it can handle data with negative representations and can be combined with broader representation learning methods. The paper introduces a topic detection approach called deep autoencoder-based fuzzy c-means (DFCM), which utilizes deep learning to improve the performance of topic detection. The DFCM method uses deep autoencoder (DAE) for representation learning, and the simulation results show that it improves the coherence score compared to the eigenspace-based fuzzy c-means (EFCM) and is comparable to standard methods such as nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA).

The paper also discusses the challenges of dealing with high-dimensional data in fuzzy c-means (FCM) and explores different approaches to address this challenge, including the use of deep neural networks. It describes the process of DFCM, which involves applying the encoder of DAE for lower-dimensional representation learning, performing FCM on the lower-dimensional representation, and then using the decoder of DAE to transform the centroids back into the original representation to obtain the topics. The paper outlines the iterative two-step optimization used in the DFCM algorithm and discusses the parameters used in the representation learning process.

Simulation results are presented to compare the performance of DFCM with EFCM, NMF, and LDA on different datasets. The results show that DFCM consistently achieves better mean coherence scores compared to EFCM, NMF, and LDA, especially for larger datasets. The paper concludes that deep learning, particularly DAE, can be effectively integrated with unsupervised learning methods such as topic detection to improve the representation of textual data and enhance the accuracy of topic extraction.
