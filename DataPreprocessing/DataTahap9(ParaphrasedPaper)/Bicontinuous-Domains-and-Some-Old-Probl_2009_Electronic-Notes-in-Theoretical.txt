K. Martin and P. Panangaden noted an interesting connection between the causal order in general relativity theory and domain theoretical notions. They introduced the concept of strongly hyperbolic posets based on the causal structure of models of space-time known as strongly hyperbolic. This paper aims to present a range of examples of strongly hyperbolic posets, demonstrate their relevance to open problems in domain theory, and suggest potential research directions.

In Section 4, the authors examine vector space orderings on \(\mathbb{R}^n\), which correspond to (convex, pointed) cones \(C\) in \(\mathbb{R}^n\). They show that when these cones are closed and have inner points, \(\mathbb{R}^n\) becomes a strongly hyperbolic poset. Although this terminology may be misleading, the authors propose investigating these orders on \(\mathbb{R}^n\) from the perspective of domain theory, as it may shed light on old unsolved problems in domain theory.

Furthermore, the paper discusses the embedding of continuous posets in continuous dcpos via the round ideal completion, as well as the relationship between the geometry of the positive cone and the round ideals of vector space orderings on \(\mathbb{R}^n\). The authors propose a procedure extending a construction by Martin and Panangaden to combine the round ideal completion and round filter completion, with the goal of compactifying \(\mathbb{R}^n\). This procedure may also be applicable to strongly hyperbolic models of space-time.

The paper also covers the properties of the Lawson topology on continuous posets, particularly in the context of bicontinuous posets, and discusses the implications of interval-compact jointly bicontinuous posets, which are termed strongly hyperbolic posets by Martin and Panangaden. The authors suggest that such posets not only have relevance in models of space-time in general relativity theory, but also link to the less restricted notion of bicontinuity.

Additionally, the authors consider the Kegelspitz \(S\) and its properties, especially in relation to the way-above relation and the problem raised by Jung regarding the class of \(FS\)-domains and the class of retracts of bifinite domains.

The paper concludes with a summary of the authors' findings and the correspondence between the bi-Scott topology on a certain set and the Scott topology on another set.
