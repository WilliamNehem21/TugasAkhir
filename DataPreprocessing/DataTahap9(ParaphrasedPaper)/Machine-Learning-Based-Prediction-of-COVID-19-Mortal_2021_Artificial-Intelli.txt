A significant number of individuals worldwide have been infected with COVID-19, and effective treatments for severe cases are still limited. Remdesivir, initially developed for the treatment of Ebola, is the only approved drug for COVID-19 in the European Union, but evidence suggests it has minimal impact on overall patient survival. Several studies have identified common risk factors for poor outcomes, such as age, male gender, and low platelet count. Machine learning models have been developed to predict mortality risk in individual patients based on data from intensive care units and electronic health records, primarily from the US and the UK, as well as a few other countries. Notably, the 4C mortality score, developed by Ali et al., is one such model.

The final model was examined to understand the influence of the most important predictors using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP). The model included 160 features, and a comprehensive list can be found in supplementary file 1.

One mechanism identified by the model involves three proteins related to the innate immune system (i.e., DDX58, MAVS, and IFIH1), which play a role in detecting and responding to viruses. Another shared mechanism involves the activation of the inflammasome, leading to cytokine secretion and subsequent caspase activation, which has been associated with both Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and COVID-19. Additionally, interleukins IL-6 and IL-10, secreted after inflammasome activation, have been shown to predict COVID-19 severity. Furthermore, the interaction between two other proteins involved in the regulation of apoptosis, Ddit3 and Bcl2l11, is suggested as a common mechanism across these conditions.

The study also developed a highly predictive machine learning model for predicting COVID-19 mortality in individual patients using data primarily from inpatient settings in Germany. This model demonstrates similar prediction performance to the 4C mortality score, although a direct comparison is challenging due to differences in the models’ formulation and patient populations. The researchers acknowledge potential biases in the data and caution regarding the model’s generalizability to patients in other countries.

The study utilized deep observational data to construct an accelerated failure time (AFT) model, which allows for the estimation of expected failure times directly. This approach is used when the proportional hazards assumption of the Cox model is not met. The researchers also discussed the potential of regorafenib and sorafenib as treatment options for COVID-19, pointing to the need for further testing in different cell systems.
