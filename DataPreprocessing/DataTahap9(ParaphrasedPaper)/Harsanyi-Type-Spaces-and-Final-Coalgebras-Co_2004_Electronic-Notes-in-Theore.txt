This paper establishes a connection between coalgebra and the foundational discussions in game theory on the representation of type spaces. The argument put forth is that type spaces can be viewed as coalgebras, with universal type spaces being final coalgebras. It is contended that the modal logics proposed in economic theory are closely linked to those in recent coalgebraic modal logic literature. The specific categories of interest in this study are typically measurable spaces or compact (Hausdorff) topological spaces. A generalized coalgebraic version of the construction of the universal type space originally presented by Heifetz and Samet is provided for certain functors in these categories. The paper introduces new results, demonstrating that every functor on the category of measurable spaces, formed from constant functors, products, coproducts, and the probability measure space functor, possesses a final coalgebra. Furthermore, the final coalgebra is constructed from the relevant version of coalgebraic modal logic. The set of theories of points in all coalgebras is considered and endowed with a measurable and coalgebra structure.

The formulas are treated as sets, which are then interpreted by singletons, resulting in a more expressive language. The aim is to have a set representing a subinterval or a measurable subset of the space [0, 1]. A technical advantage of this approach is that it ensures that the set of interpretations of formulas coincides with the measurable subsets. To achieve this, the starting point is the measurable subsets of the constants. However, the outcome is different from previous works, as the final coalgebra is based on satisfied theories rather than maximal consistent ones in a logical system. Consequently, the result is weaker as completeness is not attained. Nonetheless, this approach is deemed to be more straightforward in obtaining the final coalgebra. This method is applicable even in the absence of a logic, as evidenced in the work on measurable spaces.

The distinct aspect of this section's work, in contrast to the earlier work in section 3, is that the paper establishes the surjectivity of certain functions before proving the truth lemma. This approach is simpler but necessitates additional effort to achieve completeness results. From a coalgebra perspective, the novelty lies in using a language for sets in addition to the typical language for points, indicating potential value in studying the interaction between the two languages.
