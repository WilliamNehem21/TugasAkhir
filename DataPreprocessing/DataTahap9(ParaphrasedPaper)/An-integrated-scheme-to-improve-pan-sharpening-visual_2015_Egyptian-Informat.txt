First, the paper introduces the use of curvelet transform (CT) to decompose the intrinsic mode function (IMF) component and detail coefficient of a panchromatic (pan) image, which are directional. The paper presents a method for deciding which detail coefficient of the pan image should be injected into the multispectral (MS) coefficient based on linear dependency. Finally, the paper employs the inverse curvelet transform and inverse bidimensional empirical mode decomposition (BEMD) to obtain a high-resolution MS image.

The paper then discusses experiments conducted using IKONOS, QuickBird, and GeoEye satellite data to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in terms of spectral quality and efficiency. Various metrics, including spectral angle mapper (SAM), relative average spectral error (RASE), root mean square error (RMSE), correlation coefficient (CC), error-weighted root mean square (EGRAS), and quality with no reference (QNR), are used to evaluate the spectral and spatial quality. The results of the proposed scheme are compared with state-of-the-art pan-sharpening techniques, showing improvement in both quantitative and qualitative outcomes.

The main objective of pan-sharpening is to incorporate spatial information from a high-resolution image (e.g., pan or synthetic aperture radar [SAR] image) into a low-resolution image (e.g., MS image) while preserving the spectral characteristics of the MS image. The paper emphasizes the importance of performing registration before pan-sharpening and resampling the MS image to a similar spatial reference to avoid artifacts in the output image.

The paper describes several conventional pan-sharpening methods, such as Intensity Hue Saturation (IHS), Principle Component Analysis (PCA), Brovey transform, and Gram-Schmidt (GS), and their limitations in preserving high-quality spectral information. It also outlines the structure of the paper, which includes a brief description of BEMD and curvelet transform in Section 2, a detailed explanation of the proposed pan-sharpening scheme in Section 3, quantitative quality assessment in Section 4, presentation of different results and comparisons with other methods in Section 5, and the conclusion in Section 6.

The paper highlights the flexibility of the proposed scheme in injecting high-pass coefficients of the pan image into the low-pass sub-band of the MS image. It discusses techniques that bend the coefficients based on specified algorithms, emphasizing the improvement achieved by modifying the injection of information based on local correlation between the pan and MS images.

The proposed scheme is compared with various state-of-the-art pan-sharpening methods, including GS spectral sharpening, adaptive IHS, Brovey, PCA, and curvelet pan-sharpening methods for validation. The paper justifies the selection of these methods based on their widely recognized performance and efficiency.

Additionally, the paper details the process of using BEMD to decompose the low-resolution MS image into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and residue components, and CT to decompose the IMFs into coarse and detail coefficients. The detail coefficients of the pan image and IMFs are then fused using a linear dependency rule to obtain a high-resolution MS output image.

The proposed scheme is evaluated using synthetic and real images, demonstrating its performance both numerically and visually. The results show that the proposed scheme compares favorably with existing pan-sharpening techniques, particularly outperforming the Gram-Schmidt spectral sharpening method on the QuickBird dataset.
