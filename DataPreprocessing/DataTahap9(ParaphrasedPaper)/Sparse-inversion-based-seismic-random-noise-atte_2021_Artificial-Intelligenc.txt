The Loess Plateau in the Ordos Basin of Northwest China is a key area for oil and gas exploration, particularly regarding shale oil in China. The complex topography and thick layer of Quaternary loess on the plateau's surface produce significant random noise in the collected 3D field data, negatively impacting subsequent seismic signal processing and interpretation. As a result, enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the collected field data is a primary research focus for the region.

This study is structured as follows: first, we provide a brief overview of sparse theory. Subsequently, we introduce a model for random noise reduction, known as SRNA-SPL-MN, and employ an effective optimization algorithm based on the Split Bregman method to produce accurate filtered results. We then utilize synthetic and post-stacked field data examples within our proposed workflow. Finally, we present our conclusions.

The above discussion provides a clear understanding of the selective partial labeling (SPL). Condition 2 illustrates the SPL's ability to prioritize straightforward samples, while condition 3 suggests that as the age parameter increases, the SPL may include more intricate samples in training. In comparison to conventional labeling (CL), the SPL can automatically discern between easy and complex samples.

Given the inclusion of three regularization terms in the proposed model, experimental effort is necessary for setting the regularization parameters. Although the proposed method enhances the performance of seismic data denoising, refining the parameter selection scheme remains a significant challenge. Furthermore, while the proposed model specifically addresses seismic random noise reduction in this paper, it could be expanded to address simultaneous seismic data reconstruction and random noise reduction. A potential area for future research could involve the removal of seismic coherent noise.
