The traditional approach to program visualization and animation focuses on the programming language and computer implementation, which may not effectively assist novices in learning programming concepts. Metaphor, on the other hand, presents new ideas in terms of familiar concepts and can aid active learning. This paper explores the application of metaphor to object-oriented programming, introducing new metaphors for fundamental concepts such as class, object, object instantiation, method invocation, parameter passing, object reference, and garbage collection, with the aim of facilitating the learning process for beginners. The paper also discusses the visualization and animation of these metaphors in a program animator, compares them with existing visualizations in program animation systems, and explores their potential applications in introductory programming education. Finally, the paper concludes with an examination of the benefits of utilizing metaphors in programming education.
