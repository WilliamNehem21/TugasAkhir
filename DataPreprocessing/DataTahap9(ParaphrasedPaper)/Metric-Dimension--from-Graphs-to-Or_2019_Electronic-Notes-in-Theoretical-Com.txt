To this day, the research into the metric dimension of directed graphs has largely relied on the definitions initially proposed by Chartrand, Rains, and Zhang. Initially, they provided a characterization of directed graphs with a metric dimension of 1, and subsequently, complexity aspects were explored where it was demonstrated that determining the metric dimension of a strong digraph is NP-complete.

For clarity, an orientation "d" of an undirected graph "g" is created when every edge "uv" of "g" is directed from "u" to "v" (resulting in the arc "(u, v)"), or in the reverse direction (resulting in the arc "(v, u)"). An oriented graph "d" acts as a directed graph, which is an orientation of a simple graph. When "g" is simple, "d" cannot have two vertices "u" and "v" such that "(u, v)" and "(v, u)" are arcs. However, such symmetric arcs are allowed in digraphs, which distinguishes oriented graphs from digraphs. Throughout this paper, a reference to a graph implies an undirected graph.

Given that "v1 â‰  v2" and "p1", "p2" are shortest paths, it should be noted that all vertices of "p1" and "p2" cannot be the same. Let "x1" denote the first vertex of "p1" that does not belong to "p2", and similarly, let "x2" denote the first vertex of "p2" that does not belong to "p1". In other words, the initial vertices of "p1" and "p2" coincide up to some vertex "x", but the subsequent vertices "x1" (in "p1") and "x2" (in "p2") differ. Therefore, "daux" contains the edge "x1x2", and at least one of "x1" or "x2" belongs to "s". Additionally, "x1" and "x2" are closer to "v1" and "v2" than "w" is, which contradicts the original choice of "w".

We denote the grid Gn,m as the Cartesian product Pn x Pm of two paths Pn and Pm. A torus Tn,m is the Cartesian product Cn x Cm of two cycles Cn and Cm. In the undirected context, it is straightforward to observe that md(Gn,m) = 2, while md(Tn,m) = 3. However, the situation becomes more intricate in the directed context.

A key outcome in this section is the determination of the maximum metric dimension of a strong Eulerian oriented torus. Specifically, we examine slight modifications of the parameter WOMD. For a connected graph "g", we denote by weomd(g) the maximum value of md(d) over all strong Eulerian orientations d of g. For a family of 2-edge-connected graphs "g", we set weomd(g) = max weomd(g).

In this section, we investigate the maximum metric dimension of a strong oriented grid. For each such grid, we use the same nomenclature as introduced in Section 4.1 for tori (i.e., the vertices of the topmost row have a first coordinate of 0, and the vertices of the leftmost column have a second coordinate of 0). The main result to be demonstrated in this section is as follows.

In this study, we have examined, for a few families of graphs, the most unfavorable strong orientations in terms of metric dimension. In specific scenarios, such as when considering strong Eulerian orientations of tori, we have been able to identify the most unfavorable orientations (Theorem 4.1). For other families (graphs with bounded maximum degree and grids), we have presented both lower and upper bounds on WOMD that are more or less disparate. As future work in this area, it would be of interest to narrow the gap between our lower and upper bounds, or consider strong orientations of other graph families.
