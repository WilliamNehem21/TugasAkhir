The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is widely used as a decision support system for addressing multi-criteria decision making problems. This study reviews the various theories related to prioritization, consistency evaluation, and consistency improvement within AHP before delving into its core contribution. Consistency evaluation is a crucial aspect of AHP usage, and this paper introduces a method for enhancing the consistency of the judgment matrix through the application of the cosine consistency index (CCI). The proposed approach employs a cosine maximization method to iteratively modify the entries in the judgment matrix until an improved CCI is achieved. The method suggests that any judgment matrix can be adjusted to attain a desired level of CCI. The algorithm is tested with numerical examples, and the enhanced CCI values are validated through paired sample t-tests, which demonstrate that the algorithm significantly improves CCI values.

In addition, this study compares the performance of different methods using additive normalization, weighted least squares, and logarithmic least squares, finding that the cosine maximization method outperforms the latter two approaches. Specifically, in terms of error measures based on Euclidean distance, the cosine maximization method exhibits the lowest error compared to other methods such as eigen vector based methods, additive normalization methods, weighted least square methods, and logarithmic least square methods. As a result, this study concentrates on the cosine maximization method and aims to address some of its existing limitations in the subsequent sections.
