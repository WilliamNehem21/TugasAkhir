This academic paper concerns the development of an algorithm for the automatic reconstruction of three-dimensional objects from drawn views, utilizing a boundary representation of the models. The algorithm comprises several steps, including the automatic separation of drawings by views, determination of three-dimensional vertex coordinates, identification and marking of wire model primitives, and reconstruction of model faces and elements. The algorithm's core concept involves identifying the structural elements of three-dimensional models using predefined patterns, which are expressed as matrices. The matching algorithm employs invariants such as vertex count and edge type.

The paper notes that existing approaches are generally designed for objects with simple geometry and often do not support the reconstruction of polygonal surfaces, fillets, slots, or holes. To address this limitation, the paper presents an algorithm that can recognize these structural elements based on predetermined patterns.

The algorithm is developed based on a boundary representation, offering significant capabilities for describing complex shape geometries. The core concept of the algorithm remains identifying structural elements in three-dimensional models using predefined patterns, which are represented as matrices. These patterns are utilized to describe elements such as holes, slots, and chamfers.

The algorithm's steps include automatic separation of drawings into different views, with an emphasis on front, top, and left views. The reconstruction of model faces is based on closed loops of primitives belonging to the same plane, with a focus on minimizing the number of primitives in the loop. Additionally, the construction of structural components is based on predefined patterns, leveraging the adjacency of three-dimensional primitives extracted from the drawing, with a common vertex being crucial in this process.
