This academic paper discusses the centrality measure of betweenness in a network and investigates the problem of increasing a node's betweenness centrality by adding a limited number of new edges incident to it. The paper highlights that in the case of directed graphs, the problem does not have a polynomial-time approximation scheme unless a certain complexity theory condition is met. However, for undirected graphs, the problem similarly does not admit a polynomial-time approximation scheme. Furthermore, the paper demonstrates that, unlike the directed case, the greedy algorithm's approximation ratio is unbounded in the undirected case. Experimental evaluations of the greedy algorithm compared to another algorithm show that the greedy algorithm only requires a few edges to increase a node's betweenness and improve its ranking, outperforming the alternative approach.

The paper also explores the implications of high betweenness centrality on a node in a network, suggesting that it positively impacts the node by increasing the probability of receiving a high number of messages passing through it. The paper indicates that increasing a node's centrality has been studied for various centrality measures apart from betweenness, such as page-rank, eccentricity, and measures related to the number of paths passing through a node.

The paper structures the subsequent sections to formally define the problem, discuss the hardness of approximation, describe the two algorithms and their approximation ratios, present experimental findings, and finally, conclude and highlight potential future research directions.

The paper outlines how adding new edges increases the betweenness centrality of a node and provides examples of the impact on the value of betweenness centrality through these additions. Additionally, the paper presents findings related to the minimum number of edges needed to improve a node's ranking, distinguishing between the edges added by the greedy algorithm and those added by an alternative algorithm.
