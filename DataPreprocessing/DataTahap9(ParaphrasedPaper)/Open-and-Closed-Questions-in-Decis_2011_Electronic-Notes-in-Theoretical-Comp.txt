An academic paper describes a scenario in which three friends need to choose a designated driver for the evening. Initially, Andrew is assumed to drive but he suggests Barry instead. The group agrees that Andrew will drive unless the majority prefers Barry. When they vote, the majority chooses Barry to drive. Barry then objects, pointing out that Charles has not been considered. They decide that Barry should drive unless the majority prefers Charles, in which case Charles will be the driver. The majority ultimately prefers Charles, even though it contradicts the original choice of Andrew as the designated driver.

The paper also discusses the formal properties of decision-making models and how different assumptions can lead to different outcomes when presented with an open question. It suggests that the extension to compound formulas is easier for closed questions. Furthermore, it proposes an alternative approach of focusing on the changing awareness of the decision-making agent as a result of obtaining answers to their questions. It notes existing work on logics of awareness but highlights a lack of direct technical relationship with the proposed approach.
