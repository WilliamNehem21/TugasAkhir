The paper discusses the potential security risks and challenges faced by healthcare systems in the context of data privacy, integrity, and confidentiality. It proposes the use of attribute-based encryption for access control on electronic healthcare records to enhance security. Additionally, it examines the implementation of adaptive classifier models in edge-cloud-based healthcare systems for disease prediction and patient data preservation. The paper also explores various encryption schemes and classifier models to improve the security, efficiency, and prediction accuracy of the healthcare system. Furthermore, it discusses the use of search encryption schemes, homomorphic encryption, and classifier models for disease prediction in the cloud. The proposed research aims to address the security and performance limitations of existing healthcare systems and emphasizes the importance of privacy preservation in healthcare data management.

In addition, the paper presents a comparative analysis of different classifier models for disease prediction over edge and cloud computing platforms, highlighting the efficacy of kernel-based support vector machine classifiers. It also discusses the development of adaptive weighted probabilistic classifier models for robust disease prediction and rehabilitation of remote patients at reduced costs.

The research proposes the Secure Edge-Cloud-based Healthcare System (SECHS) architecture and evaluates its performance through experimental trials, including edge-level filtering, offloading mechanisms, and real-time patient data capturing and processing. The proposed SECHS model is compared with existing research to demonstrate improvements in network capacity utilization and response time for disease severity predictions.

The paper concludes by emphasizing the need for semantic-based healthcare interoperability frameworks and highlights the advantages of the proposed Secure Edge-Cloud-based Healthcare System in terms of security, interoperability, and performance attributes.
