This article discusses our experiences with the use of event-b, focusing on the verification of iterative quicksort as an example. We also offer criticisms and observations regarding our experiences and suggest potential improvements for the evolution of event-b in the future. While the article addresses methodical issues specific to event-b, we believe that the discussion and techniques explored are broadly relevant. Similar challenges are encountered in other methodologies such as VDM or CIRCUS and their associated tools. For instance, the technique of decomposing proof obligations using witnesses could also be applied effectively in CIRCUS.

Event-B models are comprised of contexts and machines, with contexts representing the static part of a model and machines representing the dynamic part. In this article, we assume the existence of a context without explicitly mentioning it. Machines and proof obligations are detailed in specific sections of the article.

We discuss the concept of refinement between abstract and concrete machines, where a concrete machine refines at most one abstract machine. The relationship between the states of these machines is characterized by a gluing invariant associated with the concrete machine. We also examine the refinement of concrete events by abstract events and the use of witnesses to establish the relationship between abstract parameters and concrete parameters.

The article also delves into the concept of convergence and anticipated events in the context of event-B models. We explore strategies for proving convergence and discuss the introduction of auxiliary variables in the refinement process. Additionally, we touch upon the importance of postponing termination proofs and their impact on the sensitivity of the model to modifications.

The iterative and recursive versions of algorithms are compared, highlighting the challenges and differences in verifying these approaches. The use of global variables and the absence of local variables are discussed, with suggestions for potential improvements in structuring to reduce the number of proof obligations and provide more clarity.

Overall, the article provides insights into the practical challenges and considerations involved in using event-B, and offers suggestions for potential improvements in the methodology.
