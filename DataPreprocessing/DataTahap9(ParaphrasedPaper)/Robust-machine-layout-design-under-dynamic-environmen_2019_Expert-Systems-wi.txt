Experimental findings are presented in section 4, and section 5 offers a discussion of the results, conclusions drawn from the study, and identifies opportunities for future research.

Various methods for solving Facility Layout Problems (FLPs), such as genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, tabu search, ant colony optimization, particle swarm optimization, and biogeography-based optimization, have been utilized (Sooncharoen, Vitayasak, & Pongcharoen, 2015). Genetic algorithms have been particularly popular for solving facility layout design issues, as evidenced by studies reporting their efficacy in finding near-optimal solutions in shorter computational timeframes compared to other approaches (Kia, Khaksar-Haghani, Javadian, & Tavakkolimoghaddam, 2014). Additionally, genetic algorithms outperformed other methods in specific layout design scenarios (Lenin, Siva Kumar, Islam, & Ravindran, 2013; Dapa, Loreungthup, Vitayasak, & Pongcharoen, 2013).

The impact of breakdown maintenance on facility layout design has been studied extensively, with researchers investigating its effects on material flow distances in different scenarios (Vitayasak & Pongcharoen, 2016). The integration of maintenance planning with machine layout design, particularly considering non-identical machines and dynamic demand, has been identified as a gap in the current research landscape.

The genetic algorithm functions as a population-based, nature-inspired algorithm (Goldberg, 1989; Holland, 1962), using probabilistic transition rules to guide an exploitative search and maintaining a diverse population of potential solutions. The algorithm's evolutionary search process integrates crossover and mutation operators to maneuver towards local optima and increase diversity, respectively (Hicks, 2006; Islier, 1998).

The study presented in this paper focuses on the development of an approach that integrates maintenance planning with the design of non-identical machine layouts to minimize total material flow distance, addressing a gap in the literature. Computational experiments were conducted using eleven datasets with different demand distributions, considering various maintenance scenarios (e.g., ppm/qpm ratios and levels of corrective maintenance). The results suggest that designing robust machine layouts considering machine maintenance can lead to significant reductions in material flow distances, depending on the maintenance scenarios and machine maintenance levels considered.

In conclusion, the study contributes to the existing body of knowledge by presenting an integrated approach that incorporates maintenance planning into facility layout design, highlighting the importance of considering maintenance in layout optimization. The findings also point to potential areas for future research in this domain.
