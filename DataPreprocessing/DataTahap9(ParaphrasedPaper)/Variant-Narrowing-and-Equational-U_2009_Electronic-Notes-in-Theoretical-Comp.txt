One notable technical aspect of this approach hinges on the utilization of order-sorted theories. Order-sorted theories ensure the termination of narrowing, thereby providing a finite unification algorithm in many scenarios where unsorted narrowing would not. Additionally, even in cases where both approaches terminate, it is observed that order-sorted narrowing frequently yields a smaller search space. Two notable instances showcasing the use of order-sorted theories to achieve finite unification algorithms are the theory for approximate associativity and the theory for Diffie-Hellman exponentiation. In both scenarios, narrowing with the corresponding unsorted theories results in non-termination, whereas narrowing with the order-sorted theories terminates.

We have introduced the concept of variant narrowing as a "narrowing modulo b" procedure, which ensures efficiency by potentially producing a significantly smaller search space compared to full narrowing, while maintaining completeness. We have also demonstrated that when a theory e satisfies the finite variant property, variant narrowing can be specialized to algorithms for computing both the finite variant and a complete and minimal set of e-unifiers. Furthermore, we have elucidated how, under the finite variant assumption, variant narrowing can serve as a pivotal component of a symbolic reachability analysis method for concurrent systems specified as rewrite theories, particularly for cryptographic protocols specified in this manner.
