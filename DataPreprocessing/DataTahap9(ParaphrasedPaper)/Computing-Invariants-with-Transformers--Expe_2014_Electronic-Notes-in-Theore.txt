The aims of this paper are: 1) to assess the advantages and disadvantages of the modular approach in terms of execution time and accuracy using parametric examples and a newly developed benchmark suite for loop invariant analysis called "alice", 2) to introduce a new technique, named control path transformers, which is designed to mitigate the loss of accuracy when computing loop invariants, 3) to evaluate the accuracy gains of this new technique and older ones, 4) to compare the execution times and accuracies of different tools using either precondition propagation or transformer computation (specifically comparing "aspic," "pagai," "isl," and "pips").

The paper is structured as follows: it briefly introduces the unusual transformer-based approach in section 2, presents experimental results in section 3, discusses techniques to address accuracy issues in sections 4 and 5, evaluates the impact of these improvements with the "alice" benchmark in section 6, and concludes.

The paper also discusses algorithms used in "pips" and emphasizes the need to examine the modularity provided by transformers to assess its impact on speed and accuracy. Furthermore, it addresses the accuracy of various invariant generating tools, particularly focusing on the accuracy loss observed when dealing with small transition systems.

Additionally, the paper describes the process of building control path sets for loop bodies and explains how preconditions are computed and propagated through the program. It highlights the challenges related to accuracy caused by operations like convex hulls and integer overflows, and outlines techniques used to address these challenges.

Moreover, the paper discusses the impact of various improvements, implemented in "pips," on the accuracy of loop invariant computation and presents experimental results showing the positive effect of these improvements. Lastly, it points out the need for a general benchmark for research about loop invariants and suggests revisiting the choices made for the "alice" benchmark to support larger test cases.
