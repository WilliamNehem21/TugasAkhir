Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, restrictions on physical movement and face-to-face interactions have led to significant changes in daily life. In response, technologies such as video conferencing, virtual reality (VR), and the metaverse have seen increased adoption. The global VR market, for example, was estimated at $15.81 billion in 2020, with an expected annual growth rate of 18% from 2021 to 2028. As technologies evolve rapidly, ethical considerations have become more complex, necessitating a discussion on educational methods for fostering morality.

In South Korea, the approach to public education for moral development differs from that of the United States, with a focus on separate subjects related to morals in elementary schools. The current moral curriculum in South Korea primarily involves learning ethical theories and moral judgment through storytelling. However, this approach may hinder the development of moral sensitivity.

Utilizing VR in moral development programs offers several advantages. VR technology allows for immersive, interactive, and imaginative experiences, which have been shown to positively impact motivation and interest in learning while reducing anxiety. Although research on educational programs incorporating technologies like VR has been actively conducted in various subjects, its application to moral education has been relatively limited.

Moral education should be closely linked to children's daily experiences, as moral education related to specific experiences has been found to be effective in promoting moral development. Incorporating various technologies in moral education, such as using electronic devices for activities and watching videos related to moral situations, can enhance student engagement.

The study focuses on Rest's four-component model of morality, particularly moral sensitivity and moral judgment, to assess the effectiveness of VR-based programs for moral development. The study found that promoting moral judgment is crucial for enabling moral behavior, and VR education, with its strengths in creating presence, was expected to enhance moral sensitivity.

The study involved using VR in educational settings, where VR-based learning environments provided practical contexts and safe spaces for learners to engage in specific activities and interact using multiple senses. The three main characteristics of VR—interaction, immersion, and imagination—supported meaningful learning and stimulated learners' creativity.

The study implemented a VR activity followed by classroom discussions to encourage deeper reflection and critical thinking about moral issues. Results showed that moral sensitivity measurements were significantly higher for the scenario experienced in the VR activity compared to other scenarios. However, no significant differences were observed in moral judgment between different scenarios and VR experiences.

The limitations of the study include the need for validation of the test tool considering changes in educational media and target age. Additionally, the study was limited to data collected from only one class, and future research should explore the effects of VR-based moral education over a longer period.
