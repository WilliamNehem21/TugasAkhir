The broad spectrum of dynamic functionalities provided by web scripting languages like PHP and JavaScript contributes to their flexibility and susceptibility to errors. Thus, there is a pressing need for robust static analysis tools to preempt bugs in web applications. This study delves into the potential of abstract interpretation to facilitate a meticulous value analysis capable of furnishing comprehensive typing information, which can be instrumental in the development of such tools.

The popularity of web scripting languages, PHP and JavaScript is attributed to their extensive dynamic feature set, which renders them highly flexible but unfortunately prone to errors. Notably, one of the key features is the allowance of operands of any type, entailing implicit type conversions when a specific type is required. In the case of PHP, this is referred to as "type juggling."

The concept of type juggling entails that most of our domains already encompass sufficient information to accommodate it. For instance, the definition of "tobool" relies on the set num0={0,0.0}. To define a precise abstract "tobool," it is imperative to evade loss of precision when determining whether an abstract value, such as p`, 0, kq, at certain points in our lattice, is redundant (zero has no sign). Optimizing the domains to eliminate such points has the potential to marginally enhance the efficiency of the analysis, although the precision remains unaltered. This aspect warrants further exploration in future research.
