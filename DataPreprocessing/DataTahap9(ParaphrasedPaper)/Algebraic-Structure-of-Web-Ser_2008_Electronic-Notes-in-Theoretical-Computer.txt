This academic paper discusses the potential of web services and service-oriented architecture to address challenges such as heterogeneity and scalability. The authors present an algebraic structure for web services that aids in their composition and formal description. They explore various approaches to web service composition, including agent-based and logic-based methods, and delve into the semantic web community's use of planning techniques for automated composition of semantic web services.

The authors propose an algebraic characterization of web services and define web service composition. They emphasize that a web service consists of an interface and implementation, and they discuss how types of input and output data are known beforehand. They also acknowledge that the binding and port information of web services are currently neglected for simplicity.

The paper highlights the challenge of executing web methods in a specific order due to varying input and output requirements. The authors address this issue by defining a web service as a collection of web methods based on a simple web service with additional information. They also introduce modal operators for modeling termination and an abstract version of the WLP operator, demonstrating how to determine necessary information when a specific goal is given.

The authors also discuss the implementation of relations, web service composition, tests, and modal operators in Haskell, providing a small case study to illustrate the practical application of the theory. They propose an algebraic representation of web services and show how to take advantage of the resulting structures, embedding web services into relations and forming an I-semiring with operations for composition and choice. The paper concludes with a discussion of the potential to replace the relational model by another model based on I-semirings and introduces the algebra of traces as another useful tool for web service composition.
