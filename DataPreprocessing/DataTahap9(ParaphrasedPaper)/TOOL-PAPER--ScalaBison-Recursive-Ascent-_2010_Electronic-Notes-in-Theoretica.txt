Modern LL parser generators have addressed some of the limitations of LL parsing by allowing the inclusion of code by the grammar writer to resolve ambiguities. This is feasible due to the intuitive nature of the top-down parsing technique. However, a drawback is that the grammar may become convoluted with implementation details, which may hinder its clarity. On the other hand, Bison, particularly with its precedence extensions, enables grammars to be written in a clear and declarative manner.

In left-corner parsing, a key technique involves identifying the recognition points for each production in the grammar, which are the points where ambiguity is resolved. Horspool introduces the concept of free positions, which are points where a semantic action can be inserted, as a generalization of recognition points. While the recognition point is always a free position, the reverse is not always true, as non-free positions may occur after an earlier free position in some exceptional cases. This paper selects the earliest free position with no subsequent non-free positions as the recognition point.
