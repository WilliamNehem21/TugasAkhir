Therefore, we can conclude that the set of values produced by a random continuous function is flawless and consists of an infinite number of elements. There are a number of natural inquiries about the set f[2n] of a random continuous function f. Is the set of values produced by f a random closed set? What is the extent of the set of values? Can the function cover the entire range of its codomain? In the subsequent discussion, we will provide some incomplete responses to these questions.
