Fixed-point theorems assert that certain maps have points that remain unchanged under specific conditions. These theorems are commonly utilized in denotational semantics, particularly for interpreting recursive programs. Indeed, the broad applicability and significance of fixed-point theorems in the field of mathematics cannot be overstated.
