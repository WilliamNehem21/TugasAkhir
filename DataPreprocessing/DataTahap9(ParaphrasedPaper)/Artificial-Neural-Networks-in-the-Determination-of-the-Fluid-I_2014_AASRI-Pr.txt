Ensuring proper hydration is crucial for endurance exercise, as excessive dehydration can hinder performance, while overhydration and hyponatremia can be life-threatening. The study obtained raw data from four field studies and three laboratory studies following approval from the institutional research ethics committee. The data was analyzed using SPSS version 19 software, and bivariate correlation analyses were used to examine the relationship between physiological and environmental factors and post-exercise hydration status. Statistical significance was considered at the 0.05 level.

The classification and prediction model datasets were randomized, and MATLAB was used for designing, validation, and testing of the artificial neural network (ANN) models. Classification and prediction models were developed using feedforward multilayer perceptron (MLP) and radial basis function (RBF) ANNs with single hidden layers. The performance of the models was assessed using test datasets.

The study found that MLP networks outperformed RBF networks in 87% of the classification models, producing lower mean squared error (MSE), higher correlations, sensitivities, specificities, and area under the curve (AUC). The best performing model was an MLP network that had the lowest MSE and highest AUC and correlation, with fluid intake, environmental stress index, exercise intensity, gender, and body mass as input variables. In 80% of the cases, MLP estimation models also outperformed RBF networks, with the best performing model having environmental stress index, exercise intensity, gender, and body mass as input variables.

The study noted that athletes typically replace no more than 75% of their total water losses when drinking ad libitum. Existing hydration models for athletes provide an exaggerated estimate of fluid intake, as they are based on complete replacement of sweat output. The study used a comprehensive set of physical, performance, training, and environmental variables to classify hydration status and predict fluid intake using the ANN.

The study supported body mass, exercise intensity, and ambient temperature as primary factors governing fluid loss during exercise, and also identified gender as a significant determinant of fluid intake needs in endurance athletes. This was attributed to the fact that women typically have lower sweating rates and electrolyte losses due to their smaller stature and lower metabolic rates compared to men.
