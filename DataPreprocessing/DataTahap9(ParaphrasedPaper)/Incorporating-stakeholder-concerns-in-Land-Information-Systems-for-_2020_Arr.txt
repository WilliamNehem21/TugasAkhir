Urbanization, primarily driven by people migrating in pursuit of job opportunities and improved services, leads to high population densities due to land restrictions in designated areas. According to the 2018 UN report on world urbanization prospects, only 43% of the global population resided in urban areas in 1990. This figure increased to 55% by 2018 and is projected to reach 60% by 2030. This trend is expected to place additional strain on urban land development.

The rising demand for land development puts pressure on surface runoff drainage systems and available water storage in floodplains. Studies have shown a correlation between urban growth and flood inundation areas with existing drainage systems. The reduction of lag time for collecting runoff into drainage is cited as a factor contributing to flooding. The negative impact of urban floods and the variation in flood damage from region to region has been highlighted. Projections indicate a substantial increase in global flood loss by 2050 compared to 2005, underscoring the importance of pursuing sustainable development in urban areas.

Furthermore, the economic impact on international supply chains and commodity trade adds to the pressure on urban lands. While businesses show a strong interest in urban lands, there are varied stakeholder interests. The behavior of stakeholders with regards to urban land use differs, and it is essential to acknowledge the relentless nature of floodwater without regard for administrative boundaries.

Recognizing gaps in existing research, a systematic literature review was undertaken to identify and assess tools, procedures, guidelines, and frameworks for flood and water management. The review aimed to address two key research questions: how stakeholder concerns are identified in the literature, and how these concerns are integrated into hydroGIS tools.

The current research developed and analyzed a use case to classify stakeholders and conducted a comprehensive literature survey to identify various concerns in GIS automation. The tool's development incorporated stakeholder feedback and followed state-of-the-art and novel methods. The tool underwent evaluations and iterative modifications to ensure stakeholder satisfaction.

Developers highlighted the challenge of creating a user-friendly GIS map-based hydro model without structured guidelines, emphasizing the need for improved GIS-GUI development guidelines. Time constraints for modeler-developer interactions and the need for intensified stakeholder interactions were also identified as key concerns.

The tool development focused on accurate automation of hydrology models with GIS and incorporated user concerns. A predictive development method was used for tool development, while an adaptive development methodology was utilized for user interface development. The tool was tested with stakeholders and gradually improved based on their feedback, ultimately leading to its acceptance for practical application.

Furthermore, a structured questionnaire was developed to facilitate the testing of the tool, and stakeholder satisfaction levels were measured after performing land approval tasks using the hydroGIS. The tool was refined based on stakeholder feedback and gradually improved in subsequent evaluations.

The present work represents a demonstration of the identification, evaluation, incorporation, and verification of stakeholder concerns in the hydroGIS tool, addressing a current lack of documentation in this area. The tool provides interfaces for both technical and non-technical stakeholders to assess, adjust, redo/undo, and visualize hydro and GIS inputs, processes, and outputs, thereby facilitating easy decision-making.
