This academic paper discusses the incorporation of persistent conditions into Petri nets, a traditional model for concurrent and distributed computations. The authors propose a construction to unfold a net with persistent conditions into a basic net, and establish conditions under which the unfolded net exhibits the same finite behaviors as the original net with persistence. They also instantiate the definition of general Petri nets to a specific case where the multiplicities are either 0 or 1, and introduce colored nets as a useful abbreviation of Petri nets. The paper presents examples to illustrate the implications of applying the construction to nets with persistence and discusses the limitations of this approach. It also highlights the distinction between basic nets, where events can only happen or not happen, and nets with persistent conditions, where events may occur with multiple instances.
