Further advancements in comprehending search behavior require a model of a feasible biological mechanism that enables animals and humans to produce various statistically different movement patterns without requiring complex computations and to seamlessly switch between these patterns in different environments. In our paper, we put forward such a model and analytically solve it in section 4.

Virtual environments (VE) offer a simplified means to perceive and interact with the real world, fostering a sense of spatial presence through virtual locomotion, facilitating clear navigation, and enabling interaction with objects via a user interface. Notably, VEs have gained widespread usage as a tool for studying human behavior, as they allow for the creation of unique experimental scenarios under controlled stimulus conditions. A significant challenge for VE users is maintaining awareness of their location and orientation while moving through space, particularly when the entire path is not visible at once due to occlusions. Many of the spatial abilities inherent to humans, such as navigating large-scale spaces and identifying locations, have evolved over time in natural environments, utilizing natural cues for spatial orientation and wayfinding. However, VEs lack many of the natural body-based self-motion cues, leading to systematic spatial orientation difficulties in users and necessitating the rapid development of new adaptive strategies to navigate VEs under reduced multisensory conditions. Analyzing the adaptive strategies that arise in VEs can shed light on the fundamental biological mechanisms of search behavior more vividly than studying empirical data recorded in situ. Additionally, VEs enable the study of human mobility patterns with extremely high resolution, down to scales of millimeters and milliseconds.

Gender is often identified as a determining factor in spatial cognition research. While our paper does not delve into the observed gender mobility differences in our experiments, a detailed report on this topic is intended for a future publication. Based on the results of statistical data analysis, we discuss the role of scanning and reorientations in compensating for information deficiencies while navigating VEs (section 3.1), as well as the experimentally observed super-diffusive spread of searching activity on large spatial and temporal scales (section 3.2).

In section 4, we have developed a mathematical model of decision-making in the absence of precise information on potential rewards. This model can be analytically solved for important cases (see section 4.3) and aids in generating biologically relevant hypotheses about the fundamental processes of decision-making. We conclude in the final section.

Participants, predominantly university students with a mean age of 24.2 years and a standard deviation of 3.7 years, were recruited personally and through university advertisements at the University of Bielefeld. None of the participants were familiar with the actual building represented in the virtual models A and B. Prior to testing, all adult participants and parents of children under 16 years of age provided informed written consent for participation in the study. Participation was voluntary, and participants could withdraw their consent and leave the study at any time and for any reason. All test results were kept confidential in accordance with standard data protection provisions, and individual data were managed and processed anonymously to ensure participant anonymity.

Self-motion in VEs is hindered by the absence of many natural body-based cues, and natural methods of visual exploration are limited in VEs, offering only a restricted field of view and suffering from sensory cue degradation due to device latencies and occlusion of surrounding visual input. Various experiments have suggested that optic flow without proprioception, particularly within the limited field of view of virtual display systems, may not be effective for updating heading direction, and even when physical motion cues from free walking are included, they may not be sufficient for enabling good spatial orientation in VEs.

Several studies on small animals suggested that the transition between scanning and reorientation behaviors in their movement patterns during search is influenced by complex mechanosensory responses to the local environment and may be a result of limited perception and/or patchy environmental structure. Animals exploring patchy resources can adapt turning angle distributions, selecting preferred values that allow them to remain within a patch for an optimal amount of time and maximize energetic gain. For example, the zigzag motion of daphnia appears to be an optimal strategy for patch exploitation. Thus, understanding the statistical patterns of search necessitates distinguishing between quick scanning turns and longer reorientation behaviors.

There is mounting evidence indicating that the neuromodulatory system involved in assessing reward and uncertainty in humans plays a central role in the exploration-exploitation trade-off decision. This issue can be framed as a distinction between expected uncertainty, stemming from the known unreliability of predictive cues and encoded in the brain by a neuromodulatory system with acetylcholine signals, and unexpected uncertainty, triggered by highly unexpected observations that promote exploration and encoded in the brain with norepinephrine signals. It has been proposed that an individual's decision to stay or go is influenced by the current levels of acetylcholine and norepinephrine, encoding different types of uncertainty.
