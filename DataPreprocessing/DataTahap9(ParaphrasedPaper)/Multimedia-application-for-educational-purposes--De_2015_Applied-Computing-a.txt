The paper introduces a method to enhance students' self-preparation in subjects that develop algorithmic thinking, and it discusses the benefits of this approach. Additionally, it introduces the use of animations as a supplementary tool to lectures. The paper also highlights the advantages of utilizing a professional virtual learning environment that incorporates such study materials.

In the course, students do not use any programming language; instead, they write algorithms on paper using a Czech meta-language that consists of basic commands from the Pascal programming language. The paper emphasizes that Pascal programming language was specifically developed by Nicklaus Wirth for educational purposes.

The paper describes a teaching method where students learn and practice algorithmic structures, starting with those using single variables. After mastering these structures, students proceed to learn about one-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays, and they apply their knowledge to various tasks during lessons. Students work in small groups to solve tasks, and solutions are then presented and compared on the blackboard. This approach encourages students to find multiple solutions to the given task and allows the teacher to discuss and address any incorrect solutions with the students.

The paper discusses the benefits of using a communication tool that allows students to discuss their questions and problems related to the subject with their peers. While the tool is primarily used as a means of communication among students in the course, it is occasionally utilized by teachers in conjunction with lectures and lessons.
