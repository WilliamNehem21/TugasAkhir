Identifying a process that may not be able to perform any actions, let alone receive an action, can be challenging. Augmenting the LTS with certain rules, referred to as Honda Tokoro (HT) style rules, can result in contextually unobservable receive actions in the asynchronous world becoming unobservable in the LTS model.

In another experiment, an observer introduces an output on 'a' (a!) and notices a rise in temperature. This unconventional experiment is denoted as 'a?'. The label 'a?' reflects the observed input capability. Such experiments can be characterized inductively.

Additionally, we have processes P2 and P1 that are reduction-congruent, and P1 P2. Although a! P2 and a? P2, the reverse does not hold because of the reduction capability of P2. It is worth noting that neither a?/a! nor a!/a?.

The discrepancy between the logbook (the LTS) and the actual power of experiments has been demonstrated. This mismatch is succinctly expressed by noting that the converse of Lemma 3.3 does not hold, and no characterization of the labels by contexts is possible. This is implied by a particular result.

The introduction of 77 rules certainly increases the size of the LTS and introduces some undesirable properties such as infinite branching. Avoiding these 77 rules often leads to a more useful LTS, as bisimulations are easier to construct. To illustrate the impact of removing the rule (OUTHT) on reasoning with bisimilarity, consider a trivial example involving processes L and A. The presence of an output action on 'a' in P, which is absent in Q, immediately distinguishes these processes according to Theorem 6.2. Contrast this with the use of the ÌƒHT relation, and consider how Q could match.
