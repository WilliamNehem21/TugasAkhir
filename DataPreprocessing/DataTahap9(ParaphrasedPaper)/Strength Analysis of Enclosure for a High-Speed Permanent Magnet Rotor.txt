The primary goal in rotor design is ensuring the dependable performance of the high-speed permanent magnet (PM) rotor. As the rotor speed increases, the tightness of the fit between the PM and the enclosure diminishes. Moreover, variations in temperature expansibility between the PM and the enclosure can also alter the fit between them. To ensure the PM can withstand compressive stress, it is crucial to maintain sufficient contact pressure between the PM and the enclosure across the entire speed range.
