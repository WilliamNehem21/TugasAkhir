Approximately 70% of synthetic dyes used by dyeing industries globally are azo dyes, characterized by the presence of one or more azo groups (-N=N-) in their molecular structure, serving as chromophores. These compounds are the most prevalent synthetic dyes and are highly resistant to degradation at low concentrations due to their resilience to light, heat, chemicals, and microbial attacks. Thus, the removal of such dyes before they are released as industrial waste into the environment has become a crucial concern. Various methods, such as photocatalytic degradation, photo-Fenton reaction, biodegradation, solvent extraction, coagulation, precipitation, membrane filtration, and advanced oxidation processes, have been attempted to remove dyes from wastewater. While these techniques have shown promising results, they have drawbacks, including complex preparation of materials and challenging operation processes. Moreover, they can produce secondary pollutants that are more toxic than the original compounds. In contrast, adsorption techniques are simpler, easier to implement, and scalable. Different adsorbents have been used for the removal of dyes from aqueous solutions, such as magnetite/pectin, magnetite/silica/pectin hybrid nanocomposites, activated carbon, anionic layer double hydroxide, and NiFe2O4 magnetic nanoparticles. However, these adsorbents are costly and difficult to produce, prompting researchers to develop cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternatives.

The adsorbent material was characterized using a FEI Quanta 200 FEG SEM at an energy of 15 kV, while Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) was conducted using a Nicolet Magna-IR 750 spectrometer at room temperature. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) isotherm analysis was performed using an adsorption instrument (Tristar, Micromeritics Company, USA). The pH at which the adsorbent surface becomes neutral (pHpzc) was determined following a reported method.
