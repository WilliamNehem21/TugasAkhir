This paper introduces a clinical decision support system that utilizes artificial neural networks (ANN) and focuses on predicting the risk of developing venous thromboembolism (VTE) in hospitalized patients. The system employs a multilayer perceptron (MLP) feed forward neural network to classify the risk of VTE into five levels, ranging from low to high. The input layer of the system comprises 35 variables categorized into six groups that represent the risk factors of VTE according to the Caprini model. The output layer consists of one node indicating the level of VTE risk. The system is trained using the resilient backpropagation algorithm (Rprop) and a dataset of 150 medical records from Jordan University Hospital (JUH). The authors used stratified ten-fold cross-validation to evaluate the system's generalization performance, and the results indicated an accuracy of 81%.

The proposed system utilizes an MLP feed forward neural network in conjunction with the Rprop algorithm for training. It takes input from all 35 risk factors identified by the Caprini model, and the training dataset consists of 150 medical records collected from JUH.

To establish the system, the authors conducted an experimental study to determine the optimal neural network structure for the decision support system. They then trained, tested, and validated the network's performance using stratified ten-fold cross-validation. The results demonstrated an 81% accuracy for the system.

The paper also discusses the importance of VTE as a significant health concern for hospitalized patients and the known risk factors associated with the condition. Furthermore, it explains the backpropagation algorithm commonly employed in MLPs, as well as the advantages of the resilient backpropagation (Rprop) algorithm.

Additionally, the paper touches on the use of cross-validation to assess the performance and generalization capabilities of prediction models, such as MLPs. It includes references to the work of Ho et al. and Zecchin et al. to provide context for the use of ANN in predictive modeling in different medical scenarios.

The authors also delve into the methodology for evaluating the system's performance and discuss the confusion matrix as a tool for visualizing the modelâ€™s performance in predicting different risk classes. They highlight the high accuracy of the system for both low and high-risk classes.

Finally, the paper provides background information on Abdullah A. Awidi, the author of the paper, detailing his professional credentials and achievements in the field of hematology and oncology.

Overall, the paper's key findings suggest that the developed clinical decision support system using ANN and Rprop algorithm demonstrates promising accuracy in predicting VTE risk and could potentially have significant clinical applications.
