This academic paper is structured as follows. We first present the background information in section 2. In section 3, we outline the problem at hand and introduce the tools necessary to address it. Throughout the paper, we assume that the reader has a basic understanding of quasimetric spaces, domain theory, and category theory. We provide references for further details on quasimetric spaces and domain theory [8, 1, 6], and category theory. The following notations are used in this paper:

Later in the paper, we explore a similar concept for quasimetric spaces. We refer the reader to [2, 12, 10] for various characterizations of quasimetric spaces. We conclude this section with the Kostanek-Waszkiewicz theorem, which is crucial for obtaining our main result. It provides an alternative approach for performing a dcpo completion using the poset of formal balls, rather than directly performing a Yoneda completion within the realm of quasimetric spaces.

We address the intrinsic problem affecting the space of formal balls, namely, the inconsistency between the convergence behavior of directed sets and that of Cauchy nets. To resolve this issue, we introduce the concept of translational complete directed families in the space of formal balls.

Recently, we studied mappings between quasimetric spaces that preserve d-limits of Cauchy nets and are non-expansive, referred to as y-continuous maps. It can be verified that the quasimetric spaces (and the Yoneda complete quasimetric spaces) along with the y-continuous mappings between them form a category denoted as qmet (and yqmet, respectively). Evidently, yqmet is a full subcategory of qmet. It becomes apparent that every quasimetric space has a Yoneda completion if and only if yqmet is a reflective subcategory of qmet.

We acknowledge that the construction of the idempotent Yoneda completion is technical. Hence, we provide a proof sketch and motivation for our approach in order to facilitate the reader's understanding of the underlying principles and processes. This will hopefully simplify the reader's navigation through the ensuing technical details.

In section 3.4.3, we adopt (ZF3) to define the Yoneda closed sets. Lastly, we utilize (ZF4) to obtain the desired Yoneda completion (as per definition 3.6) by forming the Yoneda closure of the embedded image of (x, d).

We define a subset a of x as Yoneda closed if every Cauchy net in a has its d-limit (whenever it exists) in a. This is akin to the concept of a d-closed subset on a poset, where a subset d is d-closed if it is closed under directed supremum ([23, 11]). Not surprisingly, the collection of Yoneda closed subsets of a quasimetric space forms the closed subsets of a topology, which we refer to as the Yoneda topology.

In our theoretical development, we also examine a quasimetric space (x, d) in terms of a specific type of directed families, namely, the translational complete ones, which provide essential information about the existing d-limits of its corresponding Cauchy net. We are interested in exploring further properties of the quasimetric space (x, d) with respect to the d-limits of Cauchy nets that may be obtained using the G-topology and Yoneda topology introduced in this paper.
