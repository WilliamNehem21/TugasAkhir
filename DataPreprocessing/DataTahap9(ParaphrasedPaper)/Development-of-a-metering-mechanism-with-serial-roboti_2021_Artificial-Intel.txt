Shamshiri and colleagues (2018a) discussed the advancements in agricultural robotics, emphasizing the integration of sophisticated sensing systems, machine vision technology, multi-robot collaboration, and cutting-edge software tools. These advanced methods have the potential to enhance the efficiency of electronic circuits used for controlling feeding conveyors. A DC motor powered the slat type feeding conveyor, and an electronic circuit was employed to actuate the motor by continuously monitoring the output of the LED-LDR sensing unit. The circuit included a current limiting resistor and a comparator IC (LM741) to control the motor based on the voltage difference across the LDR.

Additionally, the paper covered the forward kinematic analysis of a robotic arm, using trigonometric concepts to determine the position and orientation of the end-effector. The specific coordinates of the end effector were obtained for a given set of joint angles and link lengths, and the workspace of the robotic arm was carefully considered in the analysis.

In the construction of the robotic arm, four servo motors were utilized for different joints, and a microcontroller (Arduino Uno) was employed to compute the algorithm and generate pulse width modulation signals. The voltage converter circuit, including a LM317T and other components, provided the necessary power for the servo motors and microcontroller. Overload protection was implemented using current sensors (ACS712) and a relay switch. Furthermore, the study involved a simulation of the robot arm's pick and place operation for pot seedlings, which was validated via kinematic simulation using Adams multibody simulation software.

Finally, the academic paper noted that Rahul K. is pursuing a Master of Science degree at the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, specializing in farm machinery within the Department of Agricultural and Food Engineering. His research interests encompass the implementation of robotics and automation in agricultural machinery, as well as artificial intelligence, machine vision, and mechatronic system design.
