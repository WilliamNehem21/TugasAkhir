The paper discusses how a process can make choices passively or actively, implicitly or explicitly. If a process makes an active choice, it does so based on its chosen communication steps, while a passive choice is influenced by the active choice made by its peer.

Following a communication or relevant action, the session type is updated to reflect the current state of the channel. If a choice has been made, the session type changes to correspond to the choice, and if a communication action has occurred, the type representing that action is removed from the current session type, resulting in a continuation type.

The paper introduces an inference system with two components. Firstly, it presents a set of inference rules and a methodology for deriving a session type. Secondly, it describes a graph-based implementation technique using finite automata, including the subset construction.

The paper also presents "ninja", an implementation of common component models, and details the specific implementation of "ninja-c++" for the C++ language, along with a type inference tool for it.

The paper addresses the issue of linear usage of session values and introduces a prototype tool to check for linear usage. It also imposes constraints on closing a session to ensure correct program behavior.

Furthermore, the paper discusses the process of merging nodes in the graph in order to handle overlapping subsets and the assignment of unique types to session variables. It also outlines the implementation of the algorithm in three stages, including the use of an abstract syntax tree traversal to gather information about session usages, channel invocations, and participant definitions.
