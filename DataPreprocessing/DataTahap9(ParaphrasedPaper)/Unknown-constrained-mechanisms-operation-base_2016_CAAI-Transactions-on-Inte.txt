The scope of applications for assistive robots is broadening, leading to an increasing need for interactions between these robots and their environment, such as performing tasks like opening doors, pulling drawers, or serving tea. These interactions involve various constrained mechanisms within the environment. When specific task descriptions for each constrained mechanism are not available, robotic manipulators require a method to operate these unknown constrained mechanisms.

Operating unknown constrained mechanisms is highly complex. For example, opening a door involves multiple challenges, including positioning, trajectory planning, and tracking. Traditional methods for opening doors often involve modeling the door to plan a trajectory, but these approaches do not offer a universal solution as different tasks require different task descriptions. Various models and methods have been proposed to address this issue, from detailed path planning to force-position hybrid control and model-free approaches. However, these approaches have limitations such as inaccuracies and increased complexity of the controller.

This paper presents a new dynamic interactive control method for operating unknown constrained mechanisms, specifically focusing on opening doors. Five experiments are conducted to evaluate this method, comparing it to traditional impedance control. The proposed method incorporates dynamic velocity control and considers parameters like motion speed, impedance control, and attitude impedance control for the end-effector of the robot arm.
