The paper is structured as follows. It begins by introducing the concept of a dagger kernel category in section 2, followed by the description of the main examples in section 3. Factorization and (co)images are discussed in sections 4 and 5. The paper concludes with section 6, which introduces the Sasaki hook and and-then connectives through adjunctions, and examines booleanness. An open question remains regarding whether a similar construction can be possible for orthomodular lattices instead of boolean algebras. It is noted that the straightforward extension of the above construction does not work in this case, as using the and-then connective for composition to obtain kernels requires a lattice that is boolean, given that the and-then connective is neither associative nor commutative unless the lattice is boolean.
