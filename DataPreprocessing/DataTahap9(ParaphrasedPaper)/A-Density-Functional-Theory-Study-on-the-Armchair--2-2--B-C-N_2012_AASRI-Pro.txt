The distorted cross sections of (2,2) B-C-N nanotubes were examined, with larger (dl) and smaller (ds) tube diameters denoting the longest and shortest distances between two atoms in the same cross section, respectively. Slightly distorted models had dl/ds values of 1.070 for the BC6N(ii) models, while larger values of dl/ds, at 1.212, were observed for the B4C2N2(ii) models.

The default k-point wave vector was utilized in this study, with the point being the center of the first Brillouin zone and the x-point being positioned halfway across the zone. It was observed that the B2C4N2(i), B4C2N2, B3C2N3(i), and B3C2N3(iii) models exhibit direct band gaps, where the maximum of the valence bands and the minimum of the conduction bands occur at the same k-point. In contrast, for the remaining models, the band gaps were found to be indirect, with the maximum of the valence band and the minimum of the conduction band occurring at different k-points. The majority of models exhibited direct band gaps with their maxima at the x-point, except for the B2C4N2 and C2B3N3(ii) models.

It was discovered that (2,2) carbon nanotubes exhibited semiconductor behavior, whereas BN-NTs were found to be insulators. Notably, the energy gap values of (2,2) B-C-N nanotubes ranged from 0.062 to 3.874 eV, demonstrating metal, semiconductor, or insulator conductivity. Furthermore, the band structure values and types were found to depend on both the atom ratios and the types of atom arrangement. The B4C2N2 model was identified as having the strongest metallic behavior, with a structure containing two adjacent B atoms. Models such as BC6N(i), B2C4N2(i), and B3C2N3(i), which featured alternating straight C-C-C-C and B-N-B-N strain, exhibited typical semiconductor behavior, while BC6N(ii), B2C4N2(ii), and B3C2N3(ii) were found to have larger band gaps.

Ultra-long single-walled armchair (2,2) B-C-N nanotubes with various ratios of B, C, and N atoms were examined using density functional theory with B3LYP/3-21G*. These nanotubes were found to possess serrated tubular structures, and their band gaps ranged from 0.062 to 3.874 eV, indicating metal, semiconductor, or insulator conductivity, depending on the atom ratios and types of atom arrangements.
