This study explores the use of neural networks to reconstruct images from time-series waveforms obtained from fiber optic probes. The reconstruction process is challenging due to the inverse nature of the problem, involving distortion and degradation of the collected signals. The proposed method, RecaNet, is a multi-mode fiber image restoration model based on an enhanced residual convolutional neural network (CNN). It employs weight initialization, attention mechanisms, and residual connections to enhance the restoration process and performs well across different datasets. The network architecture includes downsampling and upsampling stages, and uses techniques such as efficient channel attention and center-extended convolution to improve performance.

The paper presents detailed discussions on various components of the proposed method, including the use of cognitive attention, weight initialization, and the ECAAttention mechanism. Additionally, it outlines the training process of the model and the use of skip connections to address issues such as vanishing gradients and loss of edge features during feature extraction. The study acknowledges the need for further research to improve the accuracy of the RecaNet model in image restoration for multi-mode fiber imaging.

The proposed RecaNet model aims to address the challenges of image restoration in multi-mode fiber transmission. It integrates various techniques to enhance the restoration process and has shown promising results in benchmark tests. However, the study highlights the need for additional research to overcome the remaining challenges and further improve the functionality of the model.
