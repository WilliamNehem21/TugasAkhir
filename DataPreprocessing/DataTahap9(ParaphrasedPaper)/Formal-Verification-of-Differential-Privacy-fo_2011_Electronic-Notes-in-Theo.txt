Differential privacy is a method for preserving the privacy of individuals in statistical data sets that contain personal information, such as census or health data. It aims to release accurate statistics while preventing the disclosure of individual data. Sanitization algorithms based on differential privacy are being integrated into data management systems. These algorithms modify query results to ensure differential privacy is maintained, and systems like PINQ and Airavat are examples of such implementations.

This paper aims to reconcile formal analysis techniques with the increasing use of differential privacy in abstract frameworks and implemented systems. It focuses on proving that interactive systems employing differential privacy mechanisms maintain privacy. The study specifically looks at privacy mechanisms that operate over a finite number of values, such as the truncated geometric mechanism by Ghosh et al.

The paper proposes a technique for analyzing the global behavior of a system from its local aspects, such as states, actions, and transitions. It introduces unwinding relations to prove differential noninterference in a system, and demonstrates how this notion aligns with the probabilistic and approximate nature of differential privacy.

The research also addresses the evolving landscape of differential privacy, such as pan-privacy and computational differential privacy. The authors suggest that the probabilistic automata model used in their study could be extended to accommodate these new definitions. Furthermore, they outline future directions for their work, including developing decision procedures for their proof technique, extending the theory to reason about higher-level systems, and exploring the computational model of systems like Airavat to understand the interaction between access control mechanisms and differential privacy.
