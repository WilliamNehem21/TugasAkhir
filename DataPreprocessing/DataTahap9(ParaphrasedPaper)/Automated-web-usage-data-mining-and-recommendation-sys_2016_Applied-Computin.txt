The main issue faced by many online websites is the overwhelming number of choices presented to users, which can make it difficult and time-consuming to find the right product or information. In this study, we introduce a system for automatic web usage data mining and recommendations based on a user's click stream data on a newly developed Really Simple Syndication (RSS) reader website. Our goal is to provide relevant information to users without them needing to explicitly request it. We have trained a k-nearest neighbor (KNN) classification method to be used in real-time to identify and match a user's click stream data to a particular user group, and then recommend tailored browsing options that meet the needs of that specific user at a particular time. Our results demonstrate that the KNN classifier is transparent, consistent, straightforward, and simple to use.

Data mining systems can be classified using various criteria. Jiawei and Micheline identified these criteria as the kind of database mined, the kind of knowledge mined, the type of technique utilized, and the type of application adapted. Federico and Pier noted that in web usage data mining tasks, different techniques can be adopted, but the challenge lies in determining which technique is most appropriate for the specific problem at hand. They suggested that a comprehensive data mining system could adopt a multiple approach or an integrated technique that combines the benefits of several individual approaches. Our work adopts the KNN classification method as the chosen technique for data classification.

Decision tree: Amartya and Kundan used the Classification and Regression Tree (CART) in their work, applying both the Gini index (G) and entropy value (EI) as the splitting indexes. They experimented with different sets of values and found that the best splitting attribute in each case was the outlook, with the same order of splitting attributes for both indices.

SOM model: Xuejuu et al. explored the Self Organizing Map (SOM) or Kohonen neural network model to model customers' navigation behavior based on web log data, and found that the SOM model outperformed the k-means model.

Bayesian classifier model: Rivas et al. used decision rule and Bayesian network, support vector machine, and classification tree techniques to model accidents and incidents in two companies, and found that the Bayesian network and the other methods applied were superior to statistical techniques.

Our work is based on the need to establish a flexible, transparent, consistent, straightforward, simple to understand, and easy-to-implement approach. We have tested and proven the KNN technique to be able to overcome some of the problems associated with other available algorithms.

The key components of our approach include:

1. Data pre-processing: Cleansing, formatting, and grouping of web log files into meaningful sessions.

2. Classification problem: Using the KNN method for data mining, as it is ideal for creating a mapping or hypothesis between a given set of documents and class labels for class prediction.

In the evaluation section, we present and analyze the results of our experiment to evaluate the quality of our recommendation system based on the KNN classification model. We establish that a class with the minimum distance to the test tuple will be predicted for 1-nearest neighbor (1-NN), or in case of ties, the weighted distance will predict a class with greater weighted distance (as in 5-NN). Recommendations will be made based on this for users with unknown class.
