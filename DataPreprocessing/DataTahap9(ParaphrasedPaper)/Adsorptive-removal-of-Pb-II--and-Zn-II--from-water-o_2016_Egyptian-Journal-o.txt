The significant industrial expansion in the past century has led to environmental pollution, particularly water contamination. Discharge of industrial wastewater from sectors such as textiles, paper manufacturing, plastics, leather, food, antiseptics, and dyes has resulted in substantial deterioration of water quality. Heavy metals, which are potent non-biodegradable water pollutants, have caused significant harm to both the environment and human health. Lead and zinc, in particular, are highly toxic and are commonly used in various industrial processes such as metallurgy, tannery manufacturing, paper and pulp industries, paints and varnishes, and battery manufacturing.

An inexpensive adsorbent coated with manganese oxide was developed for the removal of lead and zinc from aqueous solutions. Batch experiments were conducted to examine the effects of metal concentration, adsorbent dosage, temperature, contact time, and pH on the adsorption process. Isotherm experiments revealed that the coated adsorbent was most effective at an optimum dosage, and XRD analysis confirmed that the test sand consisted of quartz with some impurities.

The increase in adsorption was attributed to the availability of binding sites for both lead and zinc ions. The adsorption efficiency was found to be higher for zinc compared to lead, possibly due to differences in size and electronegativity. The pH of the solutions was maintained below the critical pH of hydroxide precipitation to prevent the formation of precipitates and ensure optimal adsorption efficiency.

The adsorption process followed both Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms and depended on pH and temperature. The adsorption of lead followed a pseudo-second-order kinetic model, while zinc adsorption followed a pseudo-first-order kinetic model. The spent adsorbent was successfully regenerated using 1.0 N NaOH, demonstrating its potential as a recyclable and cost-effective solution for removing heavy metals from industrial wastewater.
