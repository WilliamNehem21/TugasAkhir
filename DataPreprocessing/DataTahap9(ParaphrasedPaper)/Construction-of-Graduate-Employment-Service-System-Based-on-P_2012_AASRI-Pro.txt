Several key stakeholders involved in the employment process of college students, including governments, universities, businesses, and media, play crucial roles in facilitating the exchange of information related to college student employment. Information barriers between government and universities primarily stem from the government's lack of familiarity with college faculty, mismatched policy implementation in academic institutions, and inadequate communication about policy conditions. Similarly, information gaps between universities and enterprises are characterized by a lack of understanding of the quality of personnel needed by businesses in universities and the absence of targeted training programs. Additionally, communication challenges between government and enterprises arise from enterprises' incomplete grasp of government policies and the differing economic needs of local enterprises.

This paper serves as the foundation for the development of an ASP.NET-based student employment information platform management system. The research focuses on two main aspects: building a system model and classification module using advanced ASP.NET technology and utilizing ADO.NET technology for database access to create a comprehensive management system for public platforms sharing college student employment information. The enhancement of ASP.NET technical security mechanisms and the evaluation of the system's overall performance, particularly in the user interface and business logic design, are critical for the system's success. The data system, which underpins the entire platform, employs SQL Server 2000 to store all system data, with ADO.NET handling data manipulation and retrieval for the business logic layer.

The database serves as the foundational component responsible for storing system data, and its operations are accessed via a dynamic link library for direct interaction with the system's application. The data access layer, built on top of the database, provides data services for the web presentation layer, allowing for seamless communication between the application and the database. This layer encompasses general database operations such as selection, addition, update, and deletion, as well as interfaces and methods for business logic access to the database. The design of the data access layer has a direct impact on the success and future development of the entire system.

The management of basic student information is achieved through the student management page, "studentmanage.aspx," along with its code-behind file, "studentmanage.aspx.cs." The interface design includes controls for displaying student information, editing, deleting, and adding functionality. The initial phase of the page involves retrieving and displaying student information by accessing the database through the student class and using the SQLDataReader object to showcase the results.

The integration of ASP and ASP.NET represents a pivotal shift in service technology, signaling a new era in application integration. Leveraging ASP.NET service technology in the integration of college students' employment service information systems offers several benefits, including the preservation and utilization of diverse legacy systems in colleges, promoting data sharing and reuse due to its open standards, and simplifying maintenance while reducing costs through modular and loosely coupled architecture. However, challenges remain, such as addressing security authentication, service charges, transaction processing, and reliability, which require further research to enhance the security and functionality of public college students' employment information platforms. Leveraging grid technology to improve these platforms and maximize their business value is an area that warrants further exploration.
