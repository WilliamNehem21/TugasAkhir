Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is an optimization technique originally inspired by the movement patterns observed in bird flocks and fish schools [1,2]. The method involves tracking a group of agents (particles) as they navigate through a search space, with each agent adjusting its movement based on its own findings as well as the findings of other agents. Over time, numerous modifications and enhancements have been proposed for PSO, reflecting the ongoing interest in further exploring its capabilities and improving its performance.

While the results presented in the paper are promising, they are somewhat inconclusive since the PFIDI-enabled LPSO was only tested against standard PSO. Therefore, a more robust assessment of the capabilities of PFIDI/LPSO would be obtained if these effects were tested on advanced PSO variants. The main contribution of this article is the evaluation of the performance of a selection of PSO variants enhanced with the LPSO inertia handling technique.

The remainder of the article is organized as follows. The second section provides an overview of prior research related to the proposed LPSO technique. The third section presents an implementation of LPSO in standard PSO, while the fourth section describes the five selected PSO variants on which the proposed technique is tested. The fifth section covers the explanation of the two-phase benchmark testing methodology and the analysis of the results obtained. Additionally, an engineering application test-case is discussed in the sixth section. Finally, the article concludes with closing remarks.

The use of inertia weight adaptation is particularly interesting in the context of PFIDI. This technique employs fitness-based inertia control, both globally and locally (i.e., per-particle). For the local version (referred to as locally adaptive inertia weight), the inertia weight of each particle is determined based on the difference between the fitness of its current personal best position and the fitness of the personal best position from the previous iteration. Although the simplicity of the technique makes it appealing, it also raises concerns about its sensitivity to fitness value magnitude, which may not be desirable for general-purpose optimization methods.

Another approach proposed in the paper involves calculating the inertia weight based on a fitness-based particle ranking, aiming to achieve a similar effect. The common idea behind these inertia weight adaptation methods is that speeding up low-performing particles and slowing down high-performing particles should enhance the overall search effectiveness of the entire swarm.

Notably, a correction of +0.05 for inertia weight is introduced in one of the methods when the inertia is not disabled, which differs from the original inertia handling technique of Languid PSO. This correction is intended to compensate for the reduction in the overall velocity of the swarm resulting from the inertia switching technique.

In order to thoroughly test the effects of LPSO inertia switching technique, a selection of PSO variants was utilized. For each variant, a sub-variant enabled with LPSO inertia switching technique was implemented and its performance was compared with the pure variant. One such variant, known as dynamic multiswarm PSO (DMS-PSO), represents a radicalization of the Lbest PSO idea by dynamically reorganizing subswarms during the optimization process to avoid premature convergence.

The CEC 2014 test was chosen as a suitable benchmark for testing the effects of LPSO inertia switching technique on PSO. The test was selected for its lack of inherent bias toward the methods and techniques being evaluated. Moreover, the extensive nature of the CEC 2014 test was expected to provide strong evidence of any benefits of LPSO for PSO accuracy.

The results obtained across 100 computational runs for both pure TVAC-PSO and CL-PSO variants, as well as their L-TAVC-PSO and LCL-PSO counterparts, indicated potential benefits of LPSO inertia switching technique for shifted multimodal functions and various hybrid or composite types of functions. The implementation of LPSO also appeared to stabilize the method's performance with regard to method parameters, making it more robust and reliable, especially for real-world optimization. However, some limitations were noted, such as facilitation of convergence, which may be detrimental for problems requiring persistent global search.

Looking ahead, future research on PFIDI may explore more efficient methods of particle-wise fitness-based inertia handling, potentially based on a more sophisticated inertia weight calculation. Generalizing PFIDI to allow for continuous dynamic inertia adaptation based on personal fitness improvement holds promise for further improving PSO efficiency. Additionally, investigations into the benefits of LPSO are expected to increase with the rising number of variables, warranting testing of PFIDI on large-scale optimization problems with more than 1000 variables.
