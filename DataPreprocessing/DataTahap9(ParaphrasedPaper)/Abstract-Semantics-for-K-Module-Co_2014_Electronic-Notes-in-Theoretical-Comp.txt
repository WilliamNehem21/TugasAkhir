A structured definition comprising multiple modules is more straightforward to write, comprehend, and troubleshoot than a single module containing the entire definition. Additionally, modularization facilitates the reuse of work across definitions that share common principles or features. Consequently, it is valuable to have a semantics for module composition operations that enables a clear understanding of the properties of the resulting modules at each step of the composition process. This paper introduces an abstract semantics for a module system proposal within the K framework. It delineates K modules and module transformations using institution-based model theory as introduced by Goguen and Burstall.

The first module system for specification languages, as described by Bergstra et al., did not rely on institutions; however, their module operations were utilized in a similar manner in most subsequent institution-based module systems. This system did not include parametrization and did not directly specify a visible sub-signature, although parts of the signature could be concealed using the hiding operation.

The initial abstract module system using institution-based model theory was proposed by Diaconescu et al. A module in this system consisted of a presentation, comprising a signature within a specific institution and a set of sentences of the signature that specify the behavior of the constructs. Operations for sum, renaming, and hiding were defined on modules, and properties such as distributive laws were analyzed.

The system proposed by Goguen et al. allows a module to define its imported modules as well as its visible part. Modules are defined using partial signatures, and the concept of an implementation module for a specification module is introduced. Operations for hiding, enriching, renaming, and aggregation are defined for specification modules, and renaming and aggregation of implementation modules are also introduced.

The module system of the CASL specification language permits the hiding and revealing of sorts from a specification, which corresponds to the hiding and a specific type of enriching in our module system. CASL also supports the free operation, which alters the semantics of a module to the initial/free model.

As previously mentioned, a hiding operation withdraws a portion of the visible signature back into the hidden signature. For instance, natural numbers can be defined on top of integers by first retracting the subtraction operation, then renaming, and subsequently adding a total order on numbers and certain properties of the numbers in relation to this order. This sequence can be expressed as a hiding followed by a renaming and an enriching.
