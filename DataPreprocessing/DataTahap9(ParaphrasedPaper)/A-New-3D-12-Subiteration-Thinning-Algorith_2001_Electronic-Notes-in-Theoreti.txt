One of the researchers has introduced the concept of p-simple point. A subset consisting entirely of p-simple points can be removed at once while preserving the topology. Additionally, a p-simple point can be characterized locally. In this paper, we introduce the concept of px-simplicity, which allows us to propose a new thinning approach based on the deletion of px-simple points. Unlike existing thinning algorithms based on p-simple points, this approach does not require a preliminary labeling step or examination of an extended neighborhood.

When x is finite, the infinite connected component of x is considered the background, and the other connected components of x are referred to as cavities. To establish a correspondence between the topologies of x and x, two different types of adjacency for x and x must be considered. In this paper, we only consider the case where the adjacencies are (26, 6). An n-hole in x is identified when there is a closed n-path in x that cannot be deformed into a single point in x. For instance, a hollow ball has one cavity and no hole, a solid torus has one hole and no cavity, and a hollow torus has one cavity and two holes.

The set comprising all n-connected components of x is denoted by Cn(x), while the set of all n-connected components of x n-adjacent to a point x is denoted by Cx(x). The cardinality of x is denoted by #x. The topological numbers relative to x and x are represented by the two numbers: t6(x, x)=...

The first strategy involves the repetition of two steps. During the first step, the points belonging to p are labeled through the access of bk(x) and of wk(x) for all points x of z3. At most, l pairs (bk(x), wk(x)) have to be checked. Subsequently, during the second step, the four conditions of p-simplicity provided in proposition 3.2 are checked for all points of p, and the checking of these four conditions may be made possible by the previous labeling step.

It can be demonstrated that a px-simple point is p-simple, with the assistance of topological numbers and under assumptions made in the previous remark. Therefore, an algorithm that deletes px-simple points is ensured to preserve the topology. In the subsequent sections, we will propose a thinning algorithm for removing px-simple points.

The point y belongs to px as y belongs to v. In this case, x is not a px-simple point because the first and third px-simplicity conditions are not verified: t26(x, rx)= 0 and there is no point of rx 26-adjacent to x and to y.

A 6-subiteration thinning algorithm that removes p-simple points has already been proposed. Here, we present a general scheme for 12-subiteration thinning algorithms for deleting px-simple points. This scheme can be described using the framework of section 5.1, with del(y, dir)= s(px), where s(px) represents the set of px-simple points for y, which are not end points according to the desired skeleton and the direction dir. From this scheme, we will propose our algorithm by defining an appropriate p (see sections 6 and 7), so that our algorithm deletes at least the points removed by pk. In the following, we use lb c (resp. lb s) to indicate our final algorithm, which produces curve skeletons (resp. surface skeletons) by deleting px-simple points.

In the first part of this study, we have introduced the concept of px-simplicity. Then, we have proposed a new thinning scheme based on the parallel deletion of px-simple points, which does not require a preliminary labeling or examination of an extended neighborhood. Thus, it allows us to compare with some other existing thinning algorithms designed in a similar manner.

Algorithm a is designed such that the final proposed algorithm deletes at least the points removed by a, while preserving the same end points. This also implies that a preserves the topology. We specify that if we define p as the subset constituted of points that a may delete from any object x, and if this subset is a p-simple set, then a is guaranteed to preserve the topology.
