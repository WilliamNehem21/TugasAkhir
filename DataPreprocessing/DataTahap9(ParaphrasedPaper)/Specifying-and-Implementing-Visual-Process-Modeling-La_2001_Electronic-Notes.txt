This paper presents a framework for specifying a diagram language using graphs, graph grammars, and transformation rules, and demonstrates the use of the diagram editor generator diagen to create a diagram editor based on such a specification. The paper highlights the applicability of diagen to various visual languages, particularly to visual process modeling languages, and provides an example of using diagen to create an editor and animator for statecharts.

The paper also discusses the challenges in implementing tools for visual languages and emphasizes the utility of graph transformation systems in defining visual languages and generating tools to implement them. It showcases the specification and implementation of a statechart editing and animation tool using diagen.

Furthermore, the paper details the features of diagen editors, including compound operations for syntax-directed editing and automatic layout. It also compares diagen to other approaches for specifying and generating graphical editors, noting the different editing modes supported by various tools.

Finally, the paper mentions related work in integrating approaches for specifying and generating visual editors with animation concepts, highlighting similarities and differences between the proposed approach and other existing tools.
