In the 1980s, Chaum demonstrated an anonymous e-cash system that addressed the issue of double spending, a criminal activity that can reveal personal information about the user and lead to revocation. This system had many followers, but no other similar examples have been found. This paper presents a generalized attack scenario involving collusion between a corrupt revocation authority and verifiers, assuming a common revocation approach observed in various existing systems. The attack is detailed in the appendix (section 4), illustrating how certain systems align with this description. A general revocation system is defined, involving a public revocation list (or its complement) that may be encoded with secret keys. The coded list is readable by all, but only the revocation authority can modify it. There is a belief in the folklore about the potential development of technology to eliminate the need to trust the revocation authority with linking transactions, but so far, all general-purpose personal anonymous credentials systems reviewed in this paper are vulnerable to this type of attack. It is evident that ordinary trust in the revocation authority's integrity is inadequate, and additional trust is required to prevent the collusion attack using temporary revocations. The paper also highlights uncertainties regarding the certified attributes and the potential exploitation of this ambiguity to deceive the verifier in a showing protocol. However, it is emphasized that both technically and legally, the issuer should have certainty about the attributes she signs at the conclusion of the issuing protocol.
