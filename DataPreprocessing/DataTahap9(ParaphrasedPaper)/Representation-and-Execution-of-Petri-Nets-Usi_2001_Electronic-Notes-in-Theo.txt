In this paper, we provide an overview of our recent research, which aims to unify various petri net models using rewriting logic as a logical and semantic framework. Our work extends previous efforts in representing place/transition nets, nets with test arcs, algebraic net specifications, and timed petri nets within rewriting logic. Furthermore, we introduce colored petri nets, a variant based on an underlying programming language, and give them a rewriting logic semantics using the abbreviation CPNL.

Additionally, we demonstrate how interval timed petri nets (ITPNs) can be given a rewriting logic semantics, similar to the interval timed colored petri nets (ITCPNs) proposed by van der Aalst. We also highlight that our approach can be extended to other petri net classes, such as colored petri nets based on higher-order programming languages, colored net specifications over higher-order logics, nets with macroplaces, nets with FIFO places, object-oriented variants of petri nets, and object nets. Our findings show that these petri net classes can be naturally expressed in rewriting logic, with their semantic models often coinciding with the natural semantic models associated with rewriting logic representations.
