The paper discusses the generation of chaotic signals using microring resonators (MRRs). The study involves inputting two 1.5 Âµm Gaussian signals with spectral profiles having powers of 600 mW into the MRR system, which then utilizes nonlinear conditions to generate and propagate chaotic signals within the ring medium. The results demonstrate the controllability and manipulability of the chaotic signals by adding an additional Gaussian input into the MRRs' add port. It is highlighted that a balance between dispersion and nonlinear lengths is crucial when the propagating pulse is a soliton. Moreover, the paper explores the conversion of chaotic output signals from the ring resonator to logic codes, which are then inserted into an optical fiber transmission link with a length of 180 km to assess transmission performance. The study reveals that the transmitted signals in the form of spatial and temporal solitons can be detected at the end of the transmission link.

The research interest in MRR systems has grown due to characteristics such as wide bandwidths and high speeds associated with the pulses generated. Notably, an advantage of a multiple soliton transmission system utilizing integrated microring resonators is its ability to facilitate high data-rate transmissions over both short and long distances. The study recommends the use of narrower soliton pulses to improve system performance, as the attenuation of such soliton signals during propagation is significantly lower compared to conventional laser pulses. Ultimately, the study suggests that clear and filtered signals of spatial and temporal solitons generated through such systems could find potential applications in optical communications. Additionally, the paper highlights the generation of spatial and temporal signals with full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) values of 1.34 pm and 100 ps, respectively.
