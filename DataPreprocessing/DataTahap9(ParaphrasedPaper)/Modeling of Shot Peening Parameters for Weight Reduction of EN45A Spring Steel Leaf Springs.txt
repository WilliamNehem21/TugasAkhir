Numerous studies have focused on enhancing the fatigue strength of materials by generating compressive residual stress fields in their surface layers through shot peening. This study investigated the variations in the relaxed residual stress field with different shot peening intensities and their impact on the weight of EN 45A spring steel leaf springs. An experimental stress approach model was developed to simulate industrial conditions and predict the reduction in weight of leaf springs used in automotive vehicles. The paper outlines a time-efficient and reliable method for anticipating the thickness and weight of leaf springs at different shot peening intensities for industrial applications, based on experimental results.

A new frontier in manufacturing engineering, as proposed by Vinkel Arora et al. in 2011, involves the creation of computer-aided models of leaf springs using CATIA software and their analysis in ANSYS. This computational analysis was conducted to explore various design parameters and loading conditions with the aim of reducing the time and cost associated with actual experimental setups by providing a CAE solution. The paper concludes that CAE tools offer a cost-effective and time-saving alternative to experimental testing, despite potential errors falling within an acceptable range.

To determine the cyclic-stress curves as per ASTM specifications, specimens were subjected to axial fatigue testing, and S/N curves were plotted using procedures outlined by Aggarwal et al. in 2005. Laboratory testing of leaf springs was carried out on a test rig, and bending stress was calculated based on a formula provided by Aggarwal et al. in 2006. Leaf springs were subjected to a static stress of 432 MPa using a hydraulic ram, with the hydraulic actuators' limits set to accommodate alternating loads and a stress ratio of 0.5. Unpeened and shot-peened materials were exposed to shots of varying intensity, and improvements in fatigue life were recorded over time.

Further tests were conducted to examine the potential variation in residual stresses induced by shot peening under cyclic loading. It was observed that the relaxation of the compressive residual stress field (CRSF) occurred after a certain number of fatigue cycles due to the opening or propagation of microcracks, and this relaxation was measured on specimens using X-ray diffraction. A direct relationship was established between the relaxation of CRSF and the fatigue life, with a greater relaxation leading to a shorter fatigue life.
