In recent years, there has been a growing interest in logical systems that account for resource usage. The concept of resources is fundamental in various fields, including computer science, and plays a central role in the design of systems and programs that handle memory and data structures. Linear logic and bunched implications logic are examples of resource logics that have been developed to capture the consumption and interaction of resources in a formal manner. These logics have led to the establishment of a connection-based characterization of provability and related proof-search methods. Future research aims to extend these results to include proof-search and verification in separation logics and spatial logics.

The formula parameters are denoted using specific syntax, and a resource graph is outlined in Section 3. The document also explains the non-validity of the formula by describing the worlds in which each subformula is verified or falsified, and the proof provided in Section 3 is reiterated.

Furthermore, there is interest in exploring the integration of theorem-proving and model-checking approaches to enhance proof-search processes for resource logics. This entails investigating the potential mutual use of tools, such as bill and checkbi, for devising efficient proof and disproof tactics, and extending them to address pointer logic and various fragments of separation logics. Additionally, there is a plan to explore the relationships between resource graphs and countermodels in new resource semantics in greater depth.
