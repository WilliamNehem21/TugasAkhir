As the need for adapting a system to a changing environment becomes increasingly important, there has been a growing focus on the development of runtime-adaptable Petri nets in recent years. These Petri nets have found applications in various domains such as computer-supported cooperative work, multi-agent systems, dynamic process mining, and mobile networks. This approach not only enhances the expressive power of Petri nets but also enables a formal representation of dynamic changes. 

For a detailed discussion of the theory of adhesive HLR systems, we refer to previous literature. In this paper, we specifically investigate the categories of low-level and high-level Petri nets that qualify as weak adhesive HLR categories. It should be noted that to fully apply the general theory of adhesive HLR systems to these nets, additional properties are required, which are not addressed in this study.

The subsequent proofs closely resemble those for establishing P/T systems as weak adhesive HLR categories in existing literature. We extend these proofs to the category of markings and demonstrate the existence and preservation of mstrict-morphisms under pushouts along mstrict-morphisms.

The objective of this study is to model a small library system in which users are granted access to the reading hall if they possess an access card and are not carrying a bag. Within the reading hall, they are allowed to read books if they hold a library card. Upon leaving the reading hall, users are required to return all borrowed books.
