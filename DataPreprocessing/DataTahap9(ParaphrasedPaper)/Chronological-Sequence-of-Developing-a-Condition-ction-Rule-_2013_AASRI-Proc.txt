The majority of the agents within a system are designed to operate according to a condition-action rule, wherein the agents act based on information gathered by sensors within the domain. This research aims to elucidate the techniques used to implement condition-action rules within the agent component of an expert healthcare support system (HEASSY). It encompasses the steps and techniques involved in knowledge search and implementation within the HEASSY unit.

During the execution of the condition-action rule, the primary objective is to reach the optimal decision (Vlassis, 2007) that is most suitable for the given domain state, as observed through sensor-perceived environment. The availability of measurements determines the domain's state (condition), which in turn triggers the corresponding response (action). Thus, the observability of the system is presumed to be constant, constituting a critical issue that requires careful consideration.

The data collected within the domain at any given time provides knowledge of the domain's state, denoted as st at that time. The set of all domain states is represented as s. For our purposes, discrete states with a finite number of states are assumed, although other types of systems may exhibit continuous states with an infinite number of possibilities. The domain is considered fully observable if all sensors are active simultaneously.

This section discusses the initial part of the antecedent or domain status, where sets of domain status formulate the conditions of the domain. The action may correspond to a single condition or a combination of conditions. If an action relies on two or more domain conditions, these conditions are considered dependent; otherwise, the condition is independent. A two-fold state is explored within this context.

Optimal action is associated with each condition, whether independent or dependent. Consequently, certain conclusions depend on the facts and principles underlying the given condition, which are derived from deductive reasoning. For example, if the physiological transducer state indicates a high temperature (e.g., 40 degrees Celsius), it can be inferred that the patient has a fever. It is important to note that a high temperature can also be a symptom of other diseases, underlining the need to consult medical experts at a higher level of health services.

While smart home health systems collaborate with higher-level health services to consult medical experts, a knowledge database can offer valuable support in a well-structured system. Regardless of its location within a network reach, a system equipped with a database should be capable of interacting with smart home health systems. Clearly defined communication protocols between the systems are essential.
