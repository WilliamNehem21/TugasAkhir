Multimedia systems are currently among the most complex and compelling applications available to users. Their complexity primarily arises from the need to handle vast amounts of data while meeting real-time deadlines. Thus, evaluating the performance of the underlying workflow is a crucial aspect of designing a new multimedia system.

In recent years, the complexity of systems has significantly increased, along with the demand for fast and efficient architectures. This paper focuses on multimedia systems, which necessitate processing large data volumes while adhering to real-time deadlines. Various approaches have been proposed in the literature, such as Telegraph, Stream, and Aurora; however, our focus is on the Aria system. Aria is a middleware developed by the Arizona State University at the Computer Science and Engineering Department. It provides a new platform enabling artists to integrate innovative sensing, interaction, content, and response mechanisms into their stage performances, thereby expanding the expressive and interactive possibilities in performative, multimedia environments.

Workflows in Aria are represented as directed graphs, where nodes denote sensors (data acquisition), filters, and fusion operators (data manipulation), while edges define connections streaming objects between components. Each path in the media workflow graph delineates the flow of objects through Aria processing components.

The fundamental information unit in Aria is a data object, which can range from a simple numeric value to an entire image, and it encompass two types of information: object payload and object header. Furthermore, programmable operators with controlled delay and quality characteristics play a pivotal role in Aria. These operators consist of input and output queues, as well as a set of behaviors, influencing their computational processes.

Each operator can possess multiple input and output queues, each with a limit on the number of objects and memory occupancy, monitored by a manager that can remove objects based on specified drop policies. Additionally, behaviors are diverse implementations with varying processing, delay, and quality characteristics, with the most appropriate behavior being chosen based on certain conditions and constraints.

This paper utilizes colored petri nets (CPN) as a modeling formalism to analyze the performance of the system, particularly focusing on the evolution of the system in a probabilistic manner. Furthermore, the paper describes the methodology for transforming an Aria model into a CPN and presents a methodology to study the individual components in isolation.

The Aria system has been implemented by the Arizona State University at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. It offers a new medium that allows artists to incorporate novel sensing, interaction, content, and response mechanisms into their stage performances. This enables digital media and art researchers to expand the expressive and interactive possibilities in performative, multimedia environments.

Workflows are modeled as directed graphs with nodes representing sensors (data acquisition), filters, and fusion operators (data manipulation), and actuators (data output), and edges are used to define connections that stream objects between components. Each path in the media workflow graph describes how objects are streamed between Aria processing components.

The basic information unit is a data object, which can range from a simple numeric value to an entire image. Each object has two types of information: object payload and object header. The object payload can be a numeric value, a string, or an image. The object header consists of two fields. Aria is capable of processing, filtering, and fusing sensory inputs and actuating corresponding reactions.

The Aria system allows for the inclusion of innovative sensing, interaction, content, and response mechanisms into stage performances. It enables digital media and art researchers to expand expressive and interactive possibilities in performative, multimedia environments.
