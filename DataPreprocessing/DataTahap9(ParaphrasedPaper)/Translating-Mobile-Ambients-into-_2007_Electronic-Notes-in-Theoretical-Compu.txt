The paper introduces a translation of mobile ambients, specifically those without communication and replication, into p systems with mobile membranes. The authors present a set of developmental rules governing membranes and delineate the correspondence between ambient behavior and the evolution of the translated membrane system. An operational correspondence result between mobile ambients and p systems is also established.

Ambient calculus is a successful formalism for capturing mobility, where ambients change location by consuming particular capabilities. This formalism is well-suited for expressing mobile computation issues such as working environment, information access, and resource usage. Membrane systems, inspired by cell compartments and molecular membranes, provide a new abstract model composed of various compartments working simultaneously to accomplish system tasks. P systems with mobile membranes exemplify mobility through membrane movement, primarily through exocytosis and endocytosis operations. Both mobile ambients and p systems are utilized for modeling various aspects of distributed systems, with distributed features of mobile ambients described elsewhere, and distributed algorithms for membrane systems presented.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents pure mobile ambients, while section 3 introduces p systems with mobile membranes and local evolution rules. Section 4 represents the core of the paper, detailing the translation of mobile ambients into p systems, including a specific set of developmental rules. The paper concludes with an operational correspondence between mobile ambients and membrane systems, along with references.

Additional information on membrane systems can be found in other sources. A membrane system comprises a hierarchy of non-intersecting membranes with a distinguishable membrane, referred to as the skin, enclosing them. The exterior of the skin membrane is termed the environment, and each membrane contains multisets of objects.

There exist numerous variants and classes of p systems, some of which are outlined elsewhere. The paper provides a brief description of p systems with mobile membranes and local evolution rules, which are utilized for the translation process.

The paper describes a relationship between pure mobile ambients and p systems, achieved through a translation of ambients into p systems. Another encoding of mobile ambients into new computational models is also presented elsewhere. To translate pure mobile ambients into a specific class of p systems, certain steps are used, such as placing an additional object, dlock, near the membrane structure to simulate deadlocks in mobile ambients within membrane systems. This prevents the consumption of capability objects in a membrane system, corresponding to deadlock structures in mobile ambients.

Notably, pure mobile ambients feature a spatial tree-like structure with nodes represented by ambients and capabilities. When translated into p systems, the same tree structure is obtained, with every node as a membrane corresponding to an ambient or a capability.

The final step involves applying rules to eliminate internal dlock objects. The computation stops when all star objects from the membranes are consumed, and after introducing all dlock objects by applying specific rules, none of the rules of the form a), d), or g) can be applied.
