Euler diagrams have been utilized in various fields for many years, including applications related to data storage and representation. Establishing an abstract syntax for Euler diagrams aids in separating essential properties of the diagrams from non-essential visual details. These distinctions are contingent on the diagram's intended purpose. By employing a suitable abstract syntax, it becomes possible to discuss properties of the diagram, such as nestedness, semantics, and inference, without the need to consider irrelevant geometric and topological specifics, such as line thickness or contour shape.

A specific Euler diagram consists of labeled simple closed curves, or contours, in the plane. The essential properties of such a diagram can be represented in different ways. One widely used abstract syntax includes information about the presence of zones (or minimal regions) within the diagram. This paper proposes alternative abstract syntaxes and deliberates on their advantages and disadvantages in relation to diagrammatic properties (such as nestedness and drawability), semantic interpretation of diagrams, and diagram layout.

From a concrete perspective, a region in a concrete Euler diagram is a collection of points in the plane. It is defined inductively, commencing with the basic region of the diagram (which is the set of points in the plane) and the basic region of each contour (the interior of each contour). Utilizing complement, union, and intersection operations allows for the generation of all the regions of the diagram.

The description of an Euler diagram in terms of zones is explicitly detailed in previous works and is an abbreviated version of the abstraction utilized in other studies. Importantly, the theory presented here is more general and does not impose conditions such as the requirement for a zone to exist inside each contour. The decision to impose these conditions can be postponed until the application domain is defined.

The zone-wise abstraction has been utilized to investigate algorithms for drawing concrete diagrams given abstract ones, with the complexities of drawing contingent upon the well-formedness conditions imposed (such as disallowing concurrent lines or triple points, for instance). The use of different abstractions may facilitate the identification of essential conditions for drawing a particular diagram.
