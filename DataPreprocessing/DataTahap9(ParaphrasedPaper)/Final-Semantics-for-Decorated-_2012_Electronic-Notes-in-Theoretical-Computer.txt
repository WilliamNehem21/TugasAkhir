A similar concept of system determinization was also utilized in a non-coalgebraic context to address testing semantics, where must testing aligns with failure semantics in the absence of divergence. Additionally, an ad hoc attempt was made to provide a coalgebraic characterization of the spectrum. There remain opportunities to explore connections with these works.

Regarding future research directions, there are two potential avenues. Firstly, it would be valuable to explore the applicability of the coalgebraic treatment of decorated trace semantics within the domain of probabilistic systems. Secondly, there is interest in investigating how our approach can be amalgamated with to establish a coinductive approach to denotational (linear-time) semantics for various types of process calculi.
