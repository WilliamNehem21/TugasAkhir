This paper presents a translation from the standard network (SN) model of quantum computation to the one-way (OW) model of quantum computation. The translation preserves the structure of computations in a compositional manner, allowing for the abstraction of concrete realizations in a monadic abstraction layer.

The study focuses on the SN model and the OW model, detailing how computations are expressed in each model and how to translate between the two models in a compositional manner while preserving the computation structure. The compositional translation reveals common structures that are abstracted using the mathematical construction of a monad. An abstract model of quantum computation is provided, which can be instantiated to either the SN model or the OW model based on a choice of two parameters. This construction offers an elegant way to translate between the two models and potentially enables optimizations expressed in one model to be easily transferred to the other. The efficiency and systematic nature of the translation process are closely considered.

The OW model drives computation by performing one-qubit measurements, mostly in parallel, on a highly entangled state. Due to the non-deterministic nature of measurements, the process often results in a temporary state encoding the desired result in a Pauli basis. Classical post-processing, involving the application of appropriate Pauli operators, is then required to uncover the result.

Furthermore, the paper explores a method to combine the preparations and measurements from sub-circuits directly. The process simplifies the computational approach and introduces an algorithm for handling non-Clifford operators. The paper also discusses improving the monadic abstraction defined for the OW model and introduces conditions for the abstraction of certain procedures, leading to new approaches for reasoning about circuits in the OW model.

Overall, the paper extends the OW model and introduces alternative approaches using graphical representations for circuit approximation. The construction and abstraction of these conditions lay the foundation for improving the abstractions in the OW model. The paper concludes with acknowledgments to those who contributed to the work.
