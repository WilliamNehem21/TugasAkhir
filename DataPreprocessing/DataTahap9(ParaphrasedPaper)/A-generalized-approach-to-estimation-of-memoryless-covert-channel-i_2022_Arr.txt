Due to advancements in computer systems and the widespread use of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, sensitive data, such as financial information and personal data, is increasingly being stored in computing systems, particularly in mobile and embedded systems. Unfortunately, this trend presents opportunities for attackers to exploit side-channel signals from these devices to steal confidential data. Consequently, extensive research has been conducted on the vulnerability of cryptographic devices to side-channel attacks, highlighting the need to consider these attacks when designing systems.

To address these challenges, recent work has proposed a program-level communication model involving signal insertions and deviations in signaling time during transmission. However, existing research has focused mainly on electromagnetic (EM) covert channels and has limitations, such as overlooking data losses due to deletions, assuming fixed pulse width, and providing capacity bounds rather than actual capacity values. Furthermore, previous studies have only considered scenarios where the signal is silent while transmitting a zero bit and have assumed zero mean and the same standard deviation of the signaling time distribution irrespective of the bit. In contrast, this paper proposes a generalized communication model for various covert channels, accounting for insertions, deletions, and asynchronous nature to calculate the actual leakage capacity.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces the model for the transmitted signal, receiver, and communication channel. Section 3 presents the derivation of effective channel noise and leakage capacity. Section 4 demonstrates how the proposed model can be applied to various types of covert channels. Section 5 provides the experimental setup and results, and Section 6 offers concluding remarks.

The proposed model for the transmitter of a covert channel considers its asynchronous nature and the variation in signaling time, followed by an explanation of modeling the receiver as a pulse-shape filter. Effective channel noise is then derived as a combination of additive and jitter noise caused by the variation in signaling time, leading to the proposal of a discrete memoryless channel model.

The connection is made between covert channels based on simple power analysis (SPA) and the proposed model, demonstrating its explanatory power for leakage in worst-case scenarios. The model also extends to address power-based covert channels, particularly those generated by exploiting power management units (PMU) and voltage regulator modules (VRM) in modern computers.

Additionally, the paper discusses backscattering side-channel attacks and the use of recall time for profiling memory access without system overhead. Experimental setups involve various devices, such as an Altera Nios-II processor, an Olinuxino board with a Cortex A8 ARM core, and a Dell Precision 7730 laptop, with recorded signals using a spectrum analyzer and several types of antennas and probes.

The paper addresses various covert channel scenarios, such as cache-based covert channels, and evaluates the transmission rates and performance of different covert channels based on experimental results.

Overall, the paper's contributions include a novel communication model for covert channels, which takes into account variations in signaling time, insertions, deletions, and asynchronous nature, providing insights into the resilience of systems against EM-based covert channels.
