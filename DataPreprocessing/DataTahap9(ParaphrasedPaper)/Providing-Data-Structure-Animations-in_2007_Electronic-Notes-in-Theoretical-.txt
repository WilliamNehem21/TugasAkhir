According to the study, the majority of students, approximately 75-80%, are visual learners and are more likely to remember and understand information when it is presented with visual aids such as pictures, diagrams, and flowcharts. This applies to programming as well, as visual learners can benefit from creating visual representations such as flowcharts to map out problem solutions before writing code. Furthermore, visual representations of data structures can aid in understanding, suggesting the need for a tool that facilitates visualization of both conceptual and implementation aspects of data structures.

The study reviewed 21 tools used for data structure visualization and found that the majority of these tools (more than 14) focused on conceptual understanding, while only 7 tools were geared towards implementation-level visualization to support students in program comprehension and debugging. None of the implementation tools examined met all the specified criteria.

The authors emphasized the significance of being able to visualize the objects created during execution of Java programs, particularly those created from both user and library classes. Visualizing these objects during program execution can be crucial for program comprehension, as it can provide tangible representations of complex objects that are more readily understandable, especially for visual learners.
