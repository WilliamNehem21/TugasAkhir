The manufacturing process is an essential factor in the development of proper inventory management strategies for agricultural equipment, leading to significant reductions in production costs and operational issues such as repair, maintenance, and fuel consumption. Furthermore, the assessment of tractor-implement system performance during plowing processes can contribute to the creation of a comprehensive information database for multivariate analysis through partitioned graphical descriptions.

Soft computing models, specifically artificial neural networks (ANN) and fuzzy inference systems (FIS), have been recognized as powerful tools for modeling dynamic, uncertain, and highly nonlinear interrelationships. ANN operates with a self-learning algorithm, while FIS is based on predetermined linguistic transparency in the form of if-then rules. Additionally, the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) combines the advantages of both ANN and FIS, making it an effective modeling tool in scenarios where the physical relationships between input and output data are not fully understood.

Recent literature has demonstrated the application of ANFIS in simulating various output parameters, illustrating its potential in overcoming the inherent drawbacks of its structure. In a specific study, two flow meters were employed to measure tractor fuel consumption, a critical aspect in evaluating the efficiency of agricultural machinery.

Field operations conducted on a predetermined date and plots provided data for assessing the performance parameters of tractor-implement systems during plowing processes. These parameters were then used to establish simulation scenarios utilizing ANN and ANFIS, which enabled the prediction of performance indicators based on various input variables and implement types.

The ANFIS scenario is structured with five layers, namely fuzzification, normalization, fuzzy rule, defuzzification, and output layers, each playing a crucial role in processing the input data and generating the desired output variables. Training of the ANFIS model involves a hybrid algorithm, combining back-propagation and least square error algorithms, to automatically adjust the fuzzy rules based on the input-output data relationships.

Furthermore, the study investigated the impact of different combinations of plowing depth, forward speed, and implement type on fuel consumption. The findings revealed specific relationships between these variables, demonstrating the potential of the ANFIS and hybrid manfis+mne simulation scenarios in detecting comprehensive and uncertain relationships between performance parameters and input variables.

These conclusions highlight the potential for utilizing advanced simulation models and related physical perceptions to inform decision-making in agricultural machinery management during the plowing process.
