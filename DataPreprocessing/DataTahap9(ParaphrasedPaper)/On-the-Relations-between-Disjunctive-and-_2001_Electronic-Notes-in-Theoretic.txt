Disjunctive logic programming (DLP) and linear logic programming (LLP) are both considered as interesting extensions of classical horn logic, which forms the basis of languages like Prolog. The motivations behind the introduction of these two paradigms appear to be quite distinct. DLP was introduced to represent uncertain beliefs, while LLP was introduced to incorporate state-based computations into pure Prolog programs. An examination of the operational semantics of the two languages reveals that DLP involves an extension of the resolution step to operate over positive clauses, with implicit contraction steps applied over the selected clause. In contrast, LLP, being a sub-structural logic in which contraction is prohibited, employs resolution in a manner equivalent to multiset rewriting applied to collections of atomic formulas.

Viewing DLP as an abstraction of LLP holds appeal for several reasons. Firstly, it enables the use of techniques developed for DLP in the analysis of LLP programs. Additionally, it indicates that the DLP paradigm could have unforeseen applications as a framework for reasoning about properties of Petri nets, a well-known formalism for concurrent computations.

This paper provides a discussion on the relations between the notions of completeness of the abstraction and the proof-theoretic notion of permutability of rules, thus establishing a connection between different sections. Furthermore, it discusses the possibility of studying weak notions of negation for LLP based on the negation of DLP, and explores potential applications of DLP operational and fixpoint semantics for Petri nets analysis. Ongoing work includes the formal study of the complexity of the transformation between generic DLP proofs and restricted DLP proofs, as well as a direct proof of completeness of the abstraction and its relationship with the indirect proof presented in this paper.

Future research efforts aim to yield new ideas for the analysis of LLP programs, including a study of weak notions of negation for LLP based on the negation of DLP. Additionally, there are ongoing investigations into the relation between DLP and LLP in the context of abstract interpretation. This includes studying the formal complexity of the transformation between generic DLP proofs and restricted DLP proofs, and quantifying the gains obtained by proving properties on the abstract domain rather than on the concrete one.
