The theory originally attributed to E. Weydert in the paper is actually believed to have been first proposed by R. Hinnion, although Weydert made significant contributions to the field through his thesis. In fact, similar theories inspired by the ideas behind Strong-Frege-3 can be found in Hinnion's own works as well as in the works of other researchers such as Brady, Gilmore, and Skolem. It appears that the papers by Weydert and Hinnion are the only ones dedicated specifically to Strong-Frege-3.

These observations indicate that Strong-Frege-3 is capable of offering a range of set theoretic constructions. However, as previously mentioned, the consistency problem for Strong-Frege-3 remains unresolved. Nevertheless, it is possible to provide models of subsets of Strong-Frege-3. In the subsequent subsections, we will explore some interesting subsets and models for them.

In 1958, Friedberg demonstrated that the class of all recursively enumerable (r.e.) sets has an injective enumeration. Here, we aim to establish the same result for the subset V01, consisting of all r.e. sets that encode partial recursive functions valued in {0, 1} using the standard encoding of pairs of integers with integers.
