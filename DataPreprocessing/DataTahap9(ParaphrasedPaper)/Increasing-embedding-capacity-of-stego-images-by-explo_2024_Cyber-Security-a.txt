Attackers may attempt to detect the presence of concealed information and modify the cover contents. These detection techniques, referred to as steganalysis, can undermine the effectiveness of steganography. Therefore, the success of steganography is assessed based on its ability to increase data hiding capacity, minimize distortion of the carrier, and withstand attacks.

To enhance the embedding capacity, the study increased the number of edge pixels using morphological operator dilation on edge images and employed hybrid edge detection methods. Additionally, the authors strengthened the security of hidden data by implementing an encryption method for the secret message. However, it was found that edge detection-based embedding schemes have limited capacity, posing a challenge as the demand for data hiding grows. To address this, the study combined the results of multiple edge detectors to increase the number of edge pixels and developed a scheme capable of concealing varying numbers of bits in edge and non-edge pixels. This approach not only enhances the embedding capacity and visual quality of steganographic images, but also demonstrates strong resistance against statistical attacks.

The manuscript discusses previous studies, presents the proposed method, showcases simulated results, tests the robustness of the scheme against attacks, and outlines the implications and limitations of the work. Two different programs were developed for each proposed method, one for data implantation and the other for retrieving the implanted data. However, the study acknowledges limitations, such as the model's reliance on edge detectors and the time-consuming nature of applying predictors. Furthermore, if a steganography approach arouses suspicion about the carrier medium, the model may be deemed unsuccessful.
