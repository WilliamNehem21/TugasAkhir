This paper explores the concept of refinement in the context of partially known systems. The idea of partiality specifically pertains to transitions, where transitions between states can be present, not present (the standard case), or unknown. To reason about this third possibility, a three-valued logic is employed. The paper defines a simulation relation for such partial transition systems and demonstrates that the simulation problem for partial transition systems can be reformulated as two simulation problems for complete transition systems, utilizing an optimistic and a pessimistic completion.

Refinement plays a crucial role in the model-based development of systems, guiding the stepwise design process across various levels of abstraction. In this context, refinement serves as a correctness criterion, ensuring that the transformation of a model preserves its overall behavior and functionality. Typically, refinement is established through simulation relations between the models or specifications before and after the transformation.

Before delving into partial specifications, the paper provides definitions for the complete case. The behavior of the specifications is represented by transition systems involving a fixed set of actions, which describe the execution of operations within the system.

The system under consideration is a parallel composition of numerous components, although only one component is known. This known component shares variables and/or communication channels with other components, implying that its behavior depends on the behavior of other components (e.g., the possibility of communication), and therefore, its transition system can only be partially determined.

The paper introduces a simulation relation for partial transition systems, where partiality pertains to transitions. Both the transition systems and the results of a simulation check are formulated using a three-valued logic. The paper discusses two approaches to simulating unknown transitions: simulating unknowns with unknowns, or simulating unknowns only with known transitions. The latter approach is adopted as the definition, deemed more realistic, and the paper demonstrates that this definition aligns simulation on partial transition systems with two simulation checks on complete transition systems, employing an optimistic and a pessimistic completion.
