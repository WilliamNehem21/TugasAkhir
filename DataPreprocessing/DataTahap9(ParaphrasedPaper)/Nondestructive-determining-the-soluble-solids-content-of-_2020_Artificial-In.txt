The characteristics of fruit quality, such as external attributes (e.g., color, size, and shape) and internal attributes (e.g., soluble solids, titratable acid, and firmness), play a fundamental role in shaping consumers' purchasing preferences. While consumers' demand for high-quality fruits has traditionally focused on external attributes, there is now a growing interest in the internal attributes of fruits. Citrus fruits, known for their nutritional value and distinct flavor, are widely cultivated around the world. Among the internal attributes, the soluble solids content (SSC) is particularly crucial in influencing consumer purchasing decisions and guiding orchard management practices.

Due to the complex nature of citrus fruits, the distribution of internal attributes such as SSC and skin thickness varies significantly within individual fruits, particularly from the proximal to distal regions and between sunlit and shaded areas. The use of diffuse reflectance spectrum collected from localized or superficial layers may result in lower prediction accuracy due to the non-uniform distribution of chemical components within the fruit. To address this, the full transmittance mode is suggested as a promising technology for accurately and robustly determining SSC in citrus, as it captures more comprehensive internal tissue information and overcomes the challenges posed by inhomogeneous conditions.

While variable selection methods have been widely utilized to predict the internal quality of thin-skin fruits like pears and apples, there has been limited application to thick-skin fruits such as citrus. The thicker skin and complex internal structure of citrus present challenges in effectively selecting variables and developing prediction models for internal quality assessment. Therefore, the specific objectives of this study were to investigate the feasibility of using the full transmittance mode for predicting SSC in thick-skin fruits, compare the performance of different spectral preprocessing methods, analyze the distribution of effective variables selected by different variable selection algorithms, and assess the accuracy of prediction models developed using various combinations of spectral preprocessing methods and variable selection algorithms.

A novel algorithm called CARS (Coefficient Assisted Robust Selection) was proposed to retain wavelength variables with significant regression coefficients in the Partial Least Squares (PLS) model. CARS employs adaptive weighted sampling and Monte Carlo sampling techniques to extract key variables closely related to the measured components, particularly in scenarios with uninformative and collinear variables. The linear PLS model, known for its robustness and effectiveness in handling collinear variables and large numbers of variables, was used to develop prediction models based on the full wavelengths spectra and the effective variables selected by different variable selection algorithms. The performance of all developed models was evaluated based on various parameters such as root mean square error, correlation coefficients, and residual predictive deviation.

Among the spectral preprocessing methods, Multiplicative Scatter Correction (MSC) and Standard Normal Variate (SNV) were found to be effective in reducing noise and balancing the distribution of variables, thereby improving the transmittance spectral quality of citrus. The number and distribution of selected variables varied depending on the variable selection algorithms used, with the Sparse PLS Algorithm (SPA) yielding a significantly lower number of variables compared to CARS and Genetic Algorithm (GA). Effective variables selected by SPA were found to be closely related to water and carbohydrate content in navel orange fruit, demonstrating the algorithm's ability to capture pertinent information for predicting fruit quality.

In conclusion, the study found that SPA was the preferred variable selection algorithm for predicting SSC in citrus, despite previous contradictions in literature. The combination of spectral preprocessing and variable selection algorithms was identified as crucial for accurate analysis of visible/near-infrared spectroscopy data. This research provides insights into the challenges and methodologies for assessing internal fruit quality, particularly in thick-skin fruits like citrus, and sets the stage for further advancements in spectral analysis techniques for fruit quality assessment.
