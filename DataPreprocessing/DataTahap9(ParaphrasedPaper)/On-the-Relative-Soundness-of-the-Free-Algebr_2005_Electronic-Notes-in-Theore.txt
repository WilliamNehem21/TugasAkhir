In many formal systems for cryptographic protocol analysis, encryption operations are often represented using a free algebra. For instance, encryption can be denoted as e(k,x), where k represents the key and x represents the plaintext. Decryption, on the other hand, is usually implied and not explicitly represented. Alternatively, some approaches explicitly represent both encryption and decryption. Using this approach, encryption is denoted as e(k,x) and decryption as d(k,x), with a cancellation rule d(k,e(k,x))= x to indicate that decryption undoes encryption.

Although the explicit representation of cancellation is more expressive, it can lead to less efficient analysis. However, practical protocols often seem to be resistant to cancellation-based attacks due to techniques such as recognizable formatting and probabilistic encryption. As a result, most formal systems for cryptographic protocol analysis opt for the free algebra model, even though little formal justification is provided for this approach.

Millen addresses this issue by providing necessary and sufficient conditions for protocols using symmetric encryption, ensuring that if the secrecy property holds for a protocol in the free algebra model, it also holds in the decrypt-extended model. The conditions are specified in protocols written in a model based on parametric strand spaces and pattern matching, with two subconditions known as purity and ev-freeness.

Purity stipulates that the decryption operator should not appear in the protocol specification, while ev-freeness requires that no encryption operator is applied to a variable in the specification. The ev-free property essentially ensures that a principal does not apply an encryption operator to a term unless it has verified the structure of that term, thereby reducing the likelihood of unknowingly applying the encryption operator to the result of applying a decryption operator.

The paper utilizes a model based on parametric strands and constraint solving and proposes two constraint systems: one based on a free algebra and the other on an algebra (decrypt-extended algebra) that includes cancellation rules describing the effects of encryption and decryption. The main theorem shows that any solvable bundle in the decrypt-extended algebra is also solvable in the free algebra under certain conditions. The paper further discusses how this result can be used for proving the soundness of the free algebra with respect to the decrypt-extended algebra for secrecy properties and how it can be extended to accommodate other cryptographic algorithms and properties.

In conclusion, the paper provides a detailed analysis of different algebraic representations for cryptographic protocols and addresses the implications of these representations on the security of the protocols. It also discusses potential extensions and further research directions for improving cryptographic protocol analysis.
