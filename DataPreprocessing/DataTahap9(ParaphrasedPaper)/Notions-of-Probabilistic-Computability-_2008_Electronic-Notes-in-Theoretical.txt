Section 3 provides specific definitions for three weakened concepts of computability corresponding to the previously mentioned items (i), (ii), and (iii). By considering mixed settings, a total of five concepts are derived. Each of these computability concepts is associated with a weakened continuity concept, and the emphasis is on exploring the connections between these weakened forms of continuity and the classical properties of the representations, spaces, measures, and mappings. The paper then examines the relationships between the five concepts, either providing strong counterexamples to show that one concept does not imply the other, demonstrating that one concept always implies the other, or showing that one concept implies the other with mild additional assumptions.
