The program carries out either a deposit or a withdrawal operation. In the case of a deposit, it takes in the ID and the amount, updates its information, provides the new balance, and then returns to its original state. For a withdrawal, it performs the operation in a similar manner.

The type system assigns an effect to a process based on a given set of type assumptions. This effect reflects the pending obligations of the process. The assertion "begin l" decreases these obligations by removing the assertion label "l" from the current effect, while "end l" adds "l" to the current effect. Therefore, effects establish lower bounds on the number of "begin" assertions that must be present. If the process has an empty effect, it signifies that no obligations are pending.
