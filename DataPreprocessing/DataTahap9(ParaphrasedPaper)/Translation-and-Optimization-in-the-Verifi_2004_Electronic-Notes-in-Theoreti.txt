The challenge of compilation and translation extends beyond just the programming level to also encompass the specification level. This discussion explores the development of real-time software for programmable logic controllers (PLCs) and addresses concerns related to the accuracy and efficiency of translations between diverse semantic models. These translations are necessary to reconcile conceptually coherent models with computationally practical models.
