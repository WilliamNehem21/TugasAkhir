This academic paper discusses the usage of different data types, including registers, memory addresses, and immediate values within a computer program. It also explores the potential reasons for the slower performance of the metasm package, speculating that its operations may involve more than just a linear scan and involve symbol resolution and control-flow analysis. Additionally, the paper notes the possibility of extraneous prefixes being added to machine code as a form of obfuscation, necessitating the ability of a decoder to handle more than what is officially documented.

The paper also mentions the various proposed approaches for defining the semantics of processor instructions and the importance of having a common framework for different intermediate representations for such instructions. It references the work of reps et al., who proposed creating abstract transformers for each processor instruction to improve analysis efficiency. Finally, the paper hints at future research aimed at exploring alternative compiler backends to implement this approach.
