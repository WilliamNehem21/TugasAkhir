In simpler terms, the paper discusses how the complete set of permutations in a given algebra can be reconstructed from a finite set of permutations that only change certain elements, when combined with permutations that only affect other elements. This idea is applied to named sets to provide a finite description of their symmetries. Named sets are found to be an efficient way to represent permutation algebras, allowing for the minimization and verification of systems represented as coalgebras. The theory of named sets is shown to be captured by two fundamental facts. The paper also introduces a new concept showing that the essential part of permutation algebras lies in the symmetry of their orbits. Additionally, the paper discusses the significance of name mappings in tracing the history of resources within a named function. It concludes by introducing a functor and discussing the representation of elements of named sets in terms of the symmetry of orbits, with the aim of employing group-theoretical algorithms for minimization and model checking.
