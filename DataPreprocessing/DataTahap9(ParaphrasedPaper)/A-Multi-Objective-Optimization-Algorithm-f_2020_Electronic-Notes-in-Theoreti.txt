Clustering is widely recognized as a fundamental problem in unsupervised learning, which involves identifying patterns and structures within unlabeled data. The primary objective of clustering algorithms is to group similar objects into distinct clusters. Due to its ubiquitous nature, clustering is applied in a broad array of research domains including data compression, image analysis, bioinformatics, and data mining.

Given its general nature, clustering lacks a precise definition and can be approached using numerous well-defined problems and algorithms. There exists a diverse range of interpretations and understandings of what constitutes a cluster and how clusters are formed, with no established convention on the types of data suitable for clustering. Consequently, this diversity has led to the development of various clustering models, among which the center-based model is particularly popular.

Various algorithms have been proposed to mitigate the adverse impact of outliers in the k-means algorithm. However, many of these algorithms do not strictly adhere to partitioning clustering and instead focus on identifying and eliminating outliers. In this paper, we introduce a robust center-based clustering algorithm called sso-c, specifically designed for strict partitioning.

Solving optimization problems in a closed form can be challenging. In this study, we address an optimization problem and require a global optimization algorithm to solve it. One such recent swarm intelligence algorithm that has exhibited promising results compared to state-of-the-art algorithms is the social spider optimization algorithm (sso). Swarm intelligence involves the collective intelligence of simple agents within swarms.

The sso algorithm simulates cooperative behavior among social spiders, wherein the entire search space is likened to a communal web, with each spider's position representing a potential solution. The transmission of information across the communal web is encoded in the form of vibrations, with the algorithm distinguishing between male and female agents. The process involves iterative emulation of three cooperative operators—female cooperative operator, male cooperative operator, and mating operator—wherein spiders adjust their positions following bio-inspired laws to explore the search space and discover optimal solutions.

A variation of the k-means algorithm known as the k-medians algorithm utilizes a different objective function. Specifically, it minimizes the within-cluster error with respect to the 1-norm distance metric, making it more robust in the presence of outliers compared to the squared 2-norm distance metric utilized in the k-means algorithm.

Furthermore, the paper introduces the emax problem and its related algorithms, with the sso-a algorithm proposed to approximate solutions for this problem. Additionally, the geometric median problem and its approximation are discussed, with computational methods proposed for finding the geometric median of a set with arbitrary precision.

To determine convergence, a criterion similar to that of the k-means algorithm is employed, where the clusters are deemed stable when they no longer change. The entire procedure for the emax problem is elucidated through Algorithm 1. Additionally, the paper explores the relationship between problems p1 and p2 and proposes a solution that minimizes an objective considering both problems, effectively transforming a multi-objective optimization problem into a single-objective one.

The paper concludes with the presentation of two algorithms: the emax algorithm, which utilizes a heuristic akin to the k-means algorithm to solve the emax problem, and the sso-c algorithm, based on the social spider optimization algorithm for tackling multi-objective problems. Experimental work with more complex datasets and the development of alternative initialization procedures for sso-c are proposed as future research directions.
