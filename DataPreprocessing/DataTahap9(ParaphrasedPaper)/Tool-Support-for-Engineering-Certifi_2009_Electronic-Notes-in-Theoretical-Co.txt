The validation of models based on ontology is an automated process that involves checking the consistency and completeness of metamodels and validating domain-specific models according to various correctness criteria such as metamodel conformance and satisfaction of additional constraints.

To evaluate the availability and safety of systems, standards require the quantified assessment of random failure integrity through probabilistic calculations. This involves constructing a dependability model, which is a mathematically precise representation of the failure behavior of system components, error propagation, and error detection and recovery mechanisms. The dependability model consists of smaller sub-models related to system components, interactions, and additional mechanisms, and while the definition of these sub-models is typically carried out by dependability experts, automated tools can assemble them based on the UML architecture of the DMI. The solution of the dependability model provides the system-level availability and the hazardous failure rate, which must not exceed the allowed value (tolerable hazard rate, THR).

Although service-oriented systems generally do not have stringent certification requirements like embedded devices, certain domains such as banking processes may have domain-specific safety criteria. Deep semantic analysis of service orchestration can be used to validate the fulfillment of such criteria, and Sensoria provides a range of model-based formal analysis features.

The Diana project represents the initial phase of implementing an enhanced avionics platform called AIDA (Architecture for Independent Distributed Avionics), which aims to provide secure distribution and execution for avionics applications on virtual machines. In addition to achieving this objective, Diana also seeks to contribute to the definition and standardization of development and certification means based on model-driven system development to support the new platform. It should be noted that the development means for the AIDA platform inherit ideas introduced by the Decos tool chain presented in Section 2.
