In this study, we introduce what we believe is the initial quantum algorithm designed for multiobjective combinatorial optimization, at least to the best of our knowledge. The algorithm is built upon the adiabatic algorithm developed by Farhi et al. and involves mapping a multiobjective combinatorial optimization problem into a Hamiltonian using a convex combination among objectives. We present the mathematical properties of the eigenspectrum of the associated Hamiltonian and demonstrate that the quantum adiabatic algorithm has the potential to identify Pareto-optimal solutions as long as certain convex combinations of objectives are utilized and the underlying multiobjective problem meets specific restrictions.

Farhi et al. presented a new quantum algorithm and computational approach geared towards optimization problems, known as quantum adiabatic computing. This approach is based on the natural phenomenon of quantum annealing, through which optimization problems are paralleled to a natural optimization process, leading to the discovery of optimal solutions.

The primary contribution of this study is to demonstrate that the quantum adiabatic algorithm developed by Farhi et al. can be utilized to identify Pareto-optimal solutions within a finite time frame given specific constraints. In Theorem 4.1, we identify two structural properties that any multiobjective optimization problem must possess in order to utilize the aforementioned adiabatic algorithm.

The structure of this paper is as follows. In Section 2, we provide a concise overview of multiobjective combinatorial optimization and introduce the notation used throughout this study, as well as present new properties of multiobjective combinatorial optimization that are independently notable. In Section 3, we elucidate the quantum adiabatic theorem, which forms the basis of the adiabatic algorithm. Section 4 delves into the explanation of the adiabatic algorithm and its application to combinatorial multiobjective optimization. Section 5 outlines a proof of our central result in Theorem 4.1, while Section 6 demonstrates the usage of the adiabatic algorithm in a specific problem. Finally, Section 7 lays out a set of challenging open problems. The complete proofs of all theorems and lemmas are provided in the paper.

A multiobjective combinatorial optimization problem (MCO) involves optimizing multiple objectives over a finite set of feasible solutions. Typically, these objectives involve trade-offs among solutions, and there is generally no singular optimal solution. In this study, we adopt the definition provided by Kung, Luccio, and Preparata.

According to Theorem 4.1, the algorithm is capable of identifying only the supported solutions. Other studies have indicated that the number of unsupported solutions can be significantly greater than the number of supported solutions. Therefore, it is intriguing to develop a quantum algorithm that can approximate all Pareto-optimal solutions.
