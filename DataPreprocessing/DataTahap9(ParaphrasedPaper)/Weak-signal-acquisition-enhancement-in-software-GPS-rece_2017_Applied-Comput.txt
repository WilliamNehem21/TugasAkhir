Higher values of m led to an undesirable decomposition and resulted in mixing of residual components, while smaller transitions in m reduced the mixing and resulted in better separation. Consequently, the Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) was repeated multiple times using varying values of m.

The SVD was performed on the noise subspace (xn) using a different window size (m2) to decompose it into (x1r) and (xn). This process was repeated with several window sizes, and the signal subspace components (xr) were then added together, resulting in effective separation of signals from noise. Through iterative experimentation, an optimal value of m was determined.
