Sharing knowledge continues to be a significant challenge in organizational settings. While there have been advancements in semantic web and human-machine interface studies that offer techniques to improve information accessibility, these methods have limitations in providing contextual access tailored to individual user needs. In the context of the semantic web, information access is guided by the user domain's ontology, which is essentially a consensual conceptual definition of the domain. However, users may have their own representations of the domain that differ from the domain ontology. Furthermore, the structure of the domain ontology is typically constructed by a knowledge engineer, introducing their own perspective in building the ontology.

The latter sections of the paper describe the structures of project memory and propose an approach to capture and represent knowledge utilized and generated during the design project. The need for contextual information retrieval in design is discussed, and the representation of project memory using conceptual graphs and RDF formalisms is detailed. Information retrieval using CORESE is based on the relationship between the constructed conceptual graph and its RDF representation.

The primary goal of content structuring is to enable intelligent access to knowledge stored in the project memory, allowing flexible access according to various viewpoints. The approach includes integrating traceability procedures into the project realization process itself, which involves a slight change in project structures and organization to capture knowledge during project realization. The structure also facilitates meetings to reformulate arguments, suggestions, and criteria, encouraging project members to contribute explicitly to enrich the contents of the memory.

The structure represents the logic of discussion, with participants expressing their views supported by arguments and providing suggestions related to the design problem. Arguments and suggestions are classified and linked to the participants, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of their contributions. The global problem discussed during design meetings is decomposed into sub-problems, and suggestions are also connected to arguments and participants. The representation of project members is important for understanding the logic and reasoning behind their opinions.

To address these challenges, the paper proposes representing project memory as a semantic network and utilizing a semantic inference engine for information retrieval. The resulting memory is a network that presents the relations between project elements and relevant documents, enabling contextual information retrieval for designers. The use of conceptual graphs as a formalism for the semantic network is advocated, given their ability to represent semantic relations between concepts and their compatibility with RDF and XML. The CORESE search engine is presented as a tool for querying corporate semantic webs, interpreting RDF metadata in the conceptual graphs model to process information.

The paper concludes by discussing the potential use of the environment to gather elements from similar design projects to build a global classification of tasks, problems, and arguments in a company, providing insights into the evolution of design strategies. It also mentions plans to validate the proposed methods on other design projects and develop a graphical interface for displaying results.
