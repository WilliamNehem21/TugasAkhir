The stress and strain distributions within a given structure can be computed using various approaches, with commonly used methods available in several commercial software packages that utilize the finite element method (FEM) or the boundary element method (BEM). Recently, new techniques, such as the extended finite element model (XFEM), which are based on meshless methods, have been gaining prominence and offer several advantages over traditional methods, particularly in addressing problems related to fracture mechanics.

The location of a defect (internal, central, or external) significantly influences the impedance. The results obtained demonstrate the high sensitivity of the differential sensor in detecting surface defects. Nonetheless, a notable drawback of this sensor type is its inability to detect defects situated between two coils.
