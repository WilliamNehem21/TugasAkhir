The majority of known mineral deposits have been discovered through costly and time-consuming methods such as stream sediment geochemical data, diamond drilling, reconnaissance geochemical and geophysical surveys, and remote sensing. However, there has been a decline in the discovery of new mineral deposits coupled with an increasing demand for critical raw materials. In response, exploration geologists are seeking more efficient and innovative ways to process different data types during mineral exploration. Remote sensing, due to its wide coverage and cost-effectiveness, has emerged as a highly sought-after tool for early-phase mineral prospecting. In this study, the researchers applied an artificial intelligence-based, unsupervised anomaly detection method using Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) satellite imagery and machine learning to identify occurrences of iron deposits. The novelty of their method includes knowledge-guided and unsupervised anomaly detection, detection of anomalies only in the variable domain, and the option to choose from a range of machine learning algorithms to balance between explainability and performance. The study successfully detected both known and previously unknown iron deposit occurrence features, demonstrating the potential usefulness of the proposed unsupervised anomaly detection method in delineating mineral exploration targets, particularly in areas lacking labeled data on the existence or specific spectral signatures of anomalies.

In the context of anomaly detection, the variable domain, which contains the majority of the encoded information, is more prevalent compared to the spatial domain. Traditional signal processing methods like spectral signature matching and spectral unmixing are effective for detecting specific anomalies where the exact signatures of the anomalies are known. In high-dimensional data space, the variable domain is particularly rich, and the detection of generalized anomalies is computationally intensive.

The study area exhibited various features such as faults, heavily brecciated rocks, minor folds, and faults, all of which were observed at the Assen iron mine. The remote sensing data obtained through Landsat-8 and its Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) offered high-quality information for prospecting and geological mapping. Pre-processing phases such as radiometric correction and creation of false color composite (FCC) images were essential for refining the spectral remote sensing data for mineral exploration and lithological classification.

The machine learning algorithms implemented in the study were used to detect anomalies across a set of bands in the variable domain that contain information related to iron ore deposits. The approach involved reconstructing bands 4, 5, and 6, where the most relevant information related to ferric and ferrous oxides was available, and then using the remainder of the bands as features to identify anomalies specific to the iron ore deposit.

The authors emphasized the value of leveraging data-driven techniques to derive insights from remote sensing data, guided by discipline-specific knowledge, for reconnaissance mineral exploration. They also highlighted the effectiveness of principal component analysis (PCA) as a post-processing step to aid targeting and interpretation in delineating mineral exploration targets.

The authors expressed their gratitude to Mr. Elekanyani Negwangwatini for providing geological details about the Assen iron ore deposit and an anonymous reviewer for their constructive comments. They also thanked Prof. Hua Wang for editorial handling.
