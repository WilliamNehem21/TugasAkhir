The importance of accuracy in robotic manipulators for industrial applications cannot be understated. Achieving superior levels of accuracy necessitates controlling or measuring all potential sources of errors affecting the pose of the robot's moving platform. Joint clearance, in particular, is a critical source of error as it introduces unnecessary degrees of freedom between connected links, significantly impacting the mechanism's performance.

While numerous methods have been proposed to calculate and quantify errors attributed to joint clearances, none have adequately addressed the reliability of the solutions, a crucial aspect for accurate error prediction. This paper focuses on ensuring the reliability of solutions by employing constraint programming and interval analysis. The approach combines a branch and bound algorithm with interval analysis to establish firm bounds on pose errors based on potential clearance ranges. Experimental results indicate that this approach generally outperforms well-known solvers such as GAMS/Baron and ECLiPSe, while delivering reliable solutions.

Furthermore, the study demonstrates that the proposed implementation is generally faster than its competitors. For smaller problems involving two or three joints, the algorithm exhibits excellent performance, notably outpacing Baron due to the reduced need for high precision in these scenarios. Notably, the focus is not solely on running times, but also on the reliability of solutions. Baron solver results are shown to be occasionally unreliable, as evidenced by instances where its computed solutions were unfeasible. In light of these findings, future work could involve the implementation of more efficient filtering techniques to accelerate solution convergence and addressing the issue of unreliable solutions in additional solvers.
