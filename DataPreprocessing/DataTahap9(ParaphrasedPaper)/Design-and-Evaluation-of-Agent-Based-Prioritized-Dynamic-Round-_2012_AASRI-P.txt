This scholarly paper discusses the utilization of grid computing for tackling intricate and large-scale scientific problems by allowing the sharing, selection, and aggregation of computing resources. It underscores the significance of grid scheduling in ensuring the efficient execution of computational jobs on grids. The paper introduces a new job scheduling algorithm called Agent-based Prioritized Dynamic Round Robin (APDRR) as a means to address the limitations of existing scheduling algorithms, which often fail to simultaneously consider user and system objectives.

The APDRR algorithm is designed to achieve fairness in scheduling from both user and system perspectives by integrating features from round robin and priority job scheduling algorithms using agent technology. The paper presents a comparative performance analysis of the proposed APDRR algorithm alongside well-known job scheduling algorithms. The evaluation is based on several performance metrics, such as average waiting time, average turnaround time, and total completion time, using real workload traces on a computational grid.

The study also delves into the challenges associated with grid scheduling, emphasizing the need for effective resource management in order to optimize grid performance. Furthermore, it outlines the characteristics of space-sharing and time-sharing scheduling policies commonly employed in grid job scheduling.

Moreover, the paper discusses various existing scheduling policies and their applications in grid computing, and highlights the performance analysis of these policies through experimental computational grid-based studies. The discussion also touches upon the challenges of dynamic job scheduling in a grid environment and the complexities associated with predicting job demands in real time.

The results of the experimental evaluation demonstrate that the APDRR algorithm outperforms existing scheduling algorithms by exhibiting optimal performance from both user and system perspectives, as evidenced by its superior efficiency, scalability, and performance in comparison to other scheduling approaches. The paper also emphasizes the potential role of agent-based approaches in facilitating efficient and effective job scheduling in experimental grid environments using real workload traces.

In summary, the paper introduces the APDRR algorithm as an effective solution to the challenges of grid scheduling, and provides a comprehensive comparative analysis of its performance against other scheduling algorithms, demonstrating its superior performance and suitability for real-world grid environments.
