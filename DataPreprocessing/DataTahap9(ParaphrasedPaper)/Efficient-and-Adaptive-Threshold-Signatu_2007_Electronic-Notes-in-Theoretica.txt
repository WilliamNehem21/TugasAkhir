Nodes within the network have the ability to both join and leave, as well as fail, over time. Their size may change significantly in a short period, and mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), like common ad hoc groups, typically have a non-hierarchical structure in which their nodes function as independent peers. MANETs are attractive for military and civilian applications due to their capacity to provide a wide range of services. They are expected to be utilized for pervasive services, playing a crucial role in various aspects of daily life and impacting the way people work, interact, and engage in activities related to business, education, entertainment, and healthcare, reflecting the concept of ubiquitous computing.

To distribute a signature service, two essential tools are required: one for generating the <sk, pk> pair and another for distributing the capability to sign messages under sk among a group of distinct individuals. In this context, we assume that the MANET is associated with an RSA key pair <sk, pk>. Current solutions for distributing the signing capability to a group of individuals are based on standard threshold schemes, wherein sk is divided into a specific number of shares that are distributed to an equivalent number of co-signers.

We propose a new secret sharing scheme that additively shares sk among all current members of the network, enabling limited subgroups with different shares to collectively issue a signature on behalf of the group. The scheme is essentially a (t,t)-threshold scheme with replicated shares, and the threshold value t can be increased to enhance the robustness of the signature scheme. Each member in the subgroup independently issues a partial signature, and these partial signatures are combined to obtain a standard signature. Furthermore, the size of the produced signature is independent of the subgroup's size, and signature correctness can be easily verified. Additionally, it is possible to detect attempts by co-signers to cheat.

In this section, we present the protocols executed by the network nodes to issue a signature and increase the threshold. We make standard assumptions: each member dx of the group has a unique non-zero identifier x, such as a MAC address; dx is connected through a broadcast communication channel to its neighbors within its transmission range; dx can fail, dynamically join or leave the network, and possesses a source of randomness. Moreover, we assume the existence of a routing layer for reliable message delivery, and messages are exchanged through secure channels.
