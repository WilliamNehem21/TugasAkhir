In recent years, the interdisciplinary field of bioinformatics and neuroscience has experienced significant growth, with an increasing number of researchers focusing on molecular and cellular-level studies, leading to a large volume of publications and discoveries. The tool of scientometrics, CiteSpace II, was utilized to identify the current research trends and evolution of this interdisciplinary field using data obtained from the Web of Science. Through co-citation analysis, five distinct research clusters were identified, and the evolution of the knowledge base from 1991 to 2012 was analyzed.

The field of neuroscience, which emerged in the 1960s, originally concentrated on the structure and functions of the nervous system. However, with advancements in information technology and molecular biotechnology, there has been a growing integration of bioinformatics knowledge, such as genetics, into neuroscience research. This interdisciplinary collaboration has brought about new developments for both bioinformatics and neuroscience.

Additionally, genome-wide expression data from DNA microarray hybridization was analyzed, and the results were visually presented to illustrate gene clustering and expression patterns, providing a user-friendly interface for biologists. The findings demonstrated that genes with similar functions tend to cluster together, suggesting that co-expression of genes with known functions alongside poorly characterized or novel genes may facilitate the understanding of the functions of the latter. Furthermore, the emergence of network databases has helped consolidate biological knowledge, as evidenced by the introduction of graphical abstracts from tools like DAVID, which enable the annotation and summarization of gene and protein identifiers.

One of the identified research clusters, C5, focuses on codon and transcription-related fields, with cited literature predominantly published between 2011 and 2012. The cluster addresses seminal works such as Grantham's codon catalog and genome hypothesis, which posits that the genome, rather than individual genes, serves as the fundamental unit for codon selection. Additionally, the research of Nakamura Yusuke on the p53aip1 gene, which has significant implications for cell apoptosis, and Castro-Chavez's comparison of common codons in humans and other animals, have contributed to our understanding of codon usage and distribution.
