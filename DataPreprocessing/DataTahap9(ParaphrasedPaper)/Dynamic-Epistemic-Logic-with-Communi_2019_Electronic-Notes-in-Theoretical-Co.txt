This paper introduces a novel approach to dynamic epistemic logic involving concurrent communication actions. In contrast to previous work on concurrent epistemic action logic by Ditmarsch, Hoek, and Kooi, which utilizes true concurrency, our approach utilizes process calculus such as CCS and CSP, as well as action model logic. By employing this approach, we are able to establish the soundness, completeness, and decidability of our logic, setting it apart from other approaches. We outline an axiomatization and demonstrate that the proof of soundness, completeness, and decidability can be achieved through a reduction method.

To exemplify our approach, we consider a scenario where two students are awaiting a message from a teacher to submit their homework, with one student unaware of whether the other has received or responded to the message. We need to model the actions of the teacher sending the message (send action), each student receiving the message (receive action), and responding to the message (response action) independently. It is imperative to ensure that the receive action cannot occur before the send action, and that the response action cannot occur before the receive action, while allowing the students' actions to occur concurrently. This calls for the use of action model logic. Although modeling this in a small-scale example may seem feasible using preconditions and nondeterministic choice to account for all possible paths, the complexity grows significantly when considering a larger group of students.

Our work addresses the concurrency and communication aspects of dynamic epistemic logic using action models and process calculus. We extend action models to handle concurrency and communication, and the proofs of soundness, completeness, and decidability are facilitated through a reduction method. In subsequent sections, we offer brief introductions to multi-agent epistemic logic, action model logic, and concurrent dynamic epistemic logic, followed by a presentation of the dynamic epistemic logic proposed in this paper. The paper concludes with a summary in the final section.

Additionally, we introduce a finite set of agents, denoted by i, j, etc., and a finite set of action models as ams={a1, a2, a3,...}. An expansion law is introduced, which is pivotal in defining the semantics and axiomatization of our logic. We present a specific case of the expansion law tailored to our requirements, while also referring to the most general case of the expansion law.
