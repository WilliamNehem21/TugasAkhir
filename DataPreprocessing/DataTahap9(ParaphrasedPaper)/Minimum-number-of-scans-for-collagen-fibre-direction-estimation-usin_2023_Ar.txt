In a related study, Seidel et al. conducted a similar investigation on a human iliotibial tract sample by performing 35 scans confined to two planes and determining the fiber directions through the analysis of intensity vector maxima compared to simulated fiber directions. The volume images obtained were initially pre-aligned using rigid body registration based on fiducial markers, followed by soft registration that accounted for any geometric distortions. This pre-alignment process involved the use of three fiducial markers attached to the specimen, which were represented by 10 mm diameter water-filled spheres (0.43 caliber clear paintballs 8000, RAP4 UK), in line with the approach outlined by De Oliveira et al.
