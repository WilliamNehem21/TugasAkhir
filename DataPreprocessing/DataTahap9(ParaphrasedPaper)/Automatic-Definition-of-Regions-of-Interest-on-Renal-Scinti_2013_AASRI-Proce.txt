The academic paper discusses a method for tracing the renal region on a medical image based on renal function. The proposed approach involves using spatial and temporal points of interest for the initialization of the renal contour, and a multiagent system is suggested to expedite the process. One technique, semi-automatic tracing, enables the creation of the renal region of interest (ROI) from an initial point, as explained by Y. Aribi et al. They utilized the region_grow algorithm for semi-automatic ROI tracing. Additionally, a different method was developed to generate the renal ROI and assess renal function in a small population.

The paper also introduces the HOG3D descriptor, a descriptor based on spatio-temporal aspects and 3D gradient orientations histograms. The integral image representation is important for gradient calculation, and regular polyhedra can be used for quantifying the orientation of spatiotemporal gradients. The shape and movement descriptors are combined in our work by applying the HOG3D descriptor to a video, which is divided into cells.

Furthermore, the paper details a method for computing the transit time of a front in a point (x, y), showing that the transit time is inversely related to the speed of the front. By advancing the front in a narrow band and freezing existing pixels while inserting new ones, the propagation of the front can be determined.
