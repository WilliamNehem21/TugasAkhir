Abstract domains that are relational do not effectively handle large-scale analysis due to their lack of scalability. To address this issue, abstract interpretation-based tools often partition the set of variables into smaller, independent subsets, occasionally sharing non-relational information. In this study, we propose a method to enhance precision by maintaining fully expressive relationships between variable subsets while still ensuring linear complexity for scalability.

This approach has been previously implemented in the analysis of large avionic and aerospace C programs using AstreÃÅe and C Global Surveyor. The variable set is divided into packs, and operators of the octagon domain are applied independently to each pack. However, only non-relational information (such as intervals) is shared between packs.

To further illustrate this concept, we can select a root node in the pack tree and direct the tree such that edges point from the root to the leaves. Assuming the root is represented as p1 and that there is an edge from pi to pj only if i < j, we define father(i) as the parent pack of pi in this directed tree (undefined for p1).
