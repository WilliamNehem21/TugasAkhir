We present a clear combinatorial method for constructing final coalgebras for a minor extension of polynomial functors on sets. In this approach, type signatures are represented as directed multigraphs instead of endofunctors. The final coalgebra for a type signature f incorporates the concept of Brzozowski derivative applied to sets of paths in f.

A type signature is defined as a directed multigraph f, which includes a designation for each node as either existential or universal. The existential and universal nodes correspond to coproduct and product constructors, respectively. The directed edges of the graph represent the corresponding destructors.
