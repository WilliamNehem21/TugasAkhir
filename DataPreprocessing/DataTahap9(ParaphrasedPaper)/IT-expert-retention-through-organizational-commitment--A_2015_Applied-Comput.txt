The concept of organizational commitment has been extensively researched worldwide, with numerous studies focusing on various factors that influence it. However, there is a gap in the literature when it comes to understanding organizational commitment among high-technology employees in the IT sector, particularly in Pakistan. This study aims to address this gap by exploring the factors that contribute to organizational commitment among Pakistani IT sector high-technology employees.

The findings of this study emphasize the significance of compensation in relation to organizational commitment. While the literature strongly supports the association between compensation and organizational commitment, it is important to ascertain whether organizational commitment among Pakistani IT professionals is solely influenced by compensation or if other factors also play a role. Consequently, this study considers compensation as one of the independent variables and examines its relationship with organizational commitment in the context of Pakistani IT professionals.

To gather data, questionnaires were distributed to the heads of human resources departments in various organizations, ensuring anonymity to ensure unbiased responses. Despite the large number of employees in these organizations, the population of IT professionals was relatively small, with a total of 85 participants included in the study. With a response rate of 90%, the sample size was deemed sufficient for the analysis of the results. The study reveals a significant relationship between compensation and organizational commitment (p<0.01), suggesting the importance of recognizing positive performance and providing feedback to IT professionals. Moreover, the findings indicate that supervisor support and training and development also play crucial roles in influencing organizational commitment among IT professionals.

In summary, this study addresses the gap in research by examining the relationship between compensation, supervisor support, training and development, and organizational commitment among Pakistani IT professionals. The results confirm the positive relationship between compensation and organizational commitment, thus supporting the first hypothesis of the study.
