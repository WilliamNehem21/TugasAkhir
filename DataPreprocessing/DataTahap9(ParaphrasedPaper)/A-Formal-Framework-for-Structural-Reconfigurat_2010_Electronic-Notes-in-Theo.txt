The process of constructing a new system by repurposing pre-existing components often encounters challenges with behavioral interfaces not aligning seamlessly. These compatibility issues, stemming from discrepancies such as differing message names or unpaired messages, contribute to potential deadlocks across multiple components. This paper proposes the use of adaptation contracts (AC) to define the interoperation between components through the use of vectors. Each vector contains actions executed by individual components and results in the synchronization of all involved components. This approach allows for the synchronization of actions across different components and their respective sub-processes, irrespective of action names or hierarchical arrangements.
