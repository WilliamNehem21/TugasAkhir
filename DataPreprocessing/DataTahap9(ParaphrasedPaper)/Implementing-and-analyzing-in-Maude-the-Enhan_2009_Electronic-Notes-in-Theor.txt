The implementation of real-time features in Maude, lacking built-in support, involved creating a Java class and establishing connections with Maude through sockets. Instances of the Java class receive wait(n) messages, denoting the duration in milliseconds to wait before responding with a tick message. Upon receiving the tick message, the class updates time-related attributes and sends another wait message.

To analyze the distributed system described previously, it is necessary to represent its state as a single term, explicitly capturing its temporal behavior. The distributed system can be represented in various ways, with the decision made to minimize abstraction and explicitly represent process boundaries and inter-process connections. The analysis incorporated code from the EIGRP module and highlighted connections among processes, managed by a link class storing information about the link's endpoints, delay, message lists, and message transmission count for simulating connection errors. Message transmission delay was simulated using message-time pairs, while mte and delta functions for message pairs were also defined.

The study explored novel uses of Maude sockets, linking each Maude process to a Java object for time tracking. This java class was designed generically to facilitate leveraging other Java features from Maude.

Despite minimizing the number and size of messages by selecting EIGRP over other protocols, performance of distributed applications was observed to be adversely impacted by the need to translate messages to strings for transmission and back again upon receipt. Furthermore, the use of Maude's reflective capabilities to avoid defining specific translation functions for each operator further exacerbated performance issues. The potential solution proposed involved a socket-level send operator in Maude to transmit general terms and alleviate this problem.
