We explore a general proto-cell model comprising a conservative chemical reaction network enclosed within a membrane. The membrane forms through the self-organization of a chemical species (referred to as membrane precursor) and selectively permits the diffusion of certain other chemical species (nutrients) from an external growth medium into the proto-cell. Inside the proto-cell, nutrients are converted into all other chemical species, including the membrane precursor, leading to an increase in the membrane area and the volume of the proto-cell.

The growth behavior of the proto-cell has been previously observed to reach a stationary regime in prior models, though the specific factors responsible for this property were not clearly elucidated. This study aims to address this question by establishing both necessary and sufficient conditions for achieving stationary growth in the proto-cell.

In this research, we propose a generic proto-cell model that incorporates any conservative chemical reaction network embedded within a membrane. The membrane is formed through the self-assembly of a chemical species involved in the reaction network (membrane precursor) and acts as a semi-permeable barrier allowing the diffusion of certain nutrients from an external growth medium into the proto-cell. We present a simple algebraic necessary condition and a topological sufficient condition for achieving stationary proto-cell growth, independent of reaction kinetics, membrane properties, or nutrient flux.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the proto-cell model, Section 3 provides the proof of the simple algebraic necessary condition and the sufficient topological condition, Section 4 includes the discussion, and Section 5 presents the conclusion.

We also present two lemmas to support our findings. Lemma 3.4 establishes an upper bound for the quantity bt a based on the nutrient flux, while Lemma 3.7 ensures that the concentrations of chemical species have strictly positive lower bounds when a moiety is present in each siphon and is being fed with nutrient flux.

Additionally, we verify the sufficient condition for stationary growth across a wide range of networks, finding that the majority of tested conservative chemical reaction networks exhibit the necessary properties for stationary growth. This suggests that a diverse array of chemical reaction networks may be compatible with the emergence of life.
