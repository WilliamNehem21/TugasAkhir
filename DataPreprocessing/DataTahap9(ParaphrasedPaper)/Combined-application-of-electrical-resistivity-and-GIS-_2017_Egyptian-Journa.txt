The electrical resistivity method is a widely utilized geophysical technique for groundwater exploration, offering valuable insights into subsurface structures and lithology. The vertical electrical sounding (VES) method, in particular, reliably provides information about shallow subsurface layers.

A depiction of the subsurface section reveals three distinct geoelectrical units. The initial unit comprises quaternary wadi deposits at the surface, with a thickness ranging from 5.9 to 27 m and resistivity values varying between 304 and 1333 ohm.m. The subsequent geoelectrical unit consists of sandstone (Moghra formation), serving as the primary aquifer, with depths ranging from 5.9 to 27 m and resistivity values between 33 and 72 ohm.m.

The structural analysis of the profile indicates the presence of two likely faults. The first fault (F1) is situated southwest of VES 10, with a downthrown side extending towards the northeast, while the second fault (F2) is located southwest of VES 4, with a downthrown side in the southwestern direction. These faults form a horst structure, signifying that the central part represents the shallower section of the Moghra formation.

Furthermore, the pseudo-section demonstrates the impact of two faults in the central part of the section. The cross-section illustrates the presence of quaternary wadi deposits at the surface, with a thickness ranging from 7.2 to 34.6 m and resistivity values between 248 and 1378 ohm.m, with an increasing thickness in the NE to SW direction. This section also exhibits the influence of two probable faults, forming a horst structure, with the first fault located to the southwest of VES 12 and the second fault to the southwest of VES 6.
