In this contemporary era, email communication has become widely accepted as an efficient and reliable method of correspondence. Email messages can be directed to individual recipients or disseminated to groups, reaching a large number of people simultaneously. The pervasive nature of email has made it an indispensable tool for communication for the majority of individuals. However, the widespread use of email has also made it a popular medium for individuals with malicious intent.

The proliferation of the internet has led to a significant increase in the number of email users, but it has also resulted in a notable rise in the incidence of spam emails. Statistical reports indicate that a substantial portion of email traffic consists of spam. As a result, there is a growing emphasis on the classification of emails into various categories, such as legitimate and illegitimate, spam and ham, suspicious and non-suspicious, fraudulent and normal, formal and informal, etc.

Research in this field addresses the detection of illicit emails, including spam, suspicious emails, and phishing emails. Another area of focus is the identification of the authors of anonymous emails. Various studies have proposed methods for detecting spam emails, such as ontology-based filtering and the use of word stemming for more efficient detection. Additionally, there is a distinct category of suspicious emails that may contain content related to illicit activities, prompting further investigation by law enforcement agencies.

Phishing emails pose a significant security and privacy concern due to their deceptive nature, often appearing as legitimate correspondence from reputable sources in an attempt to obtain sensitive information from recipients. The detection of fraudulent emails is approached as a classification problem, necessitating the use of feature sets and classification algorithms. Modules for extracting email contents, constructing features, and detecting fraudulent emails have been developed as part of this effort, with the objective of achieving accurate classification results.

In experimental studies, machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) have been employed for text classification to distinguish fraudulent emails from normal ones. Testing has been conducted using a dataset consisting of a large number of emails, half of which are fraudulent and the other half are normal. These experiments involve the preprocessing of emails and the representation of each email as a vector of features, with a focus on features commonly found in fraudulent emails intended to deceive recipients.
