Medication delivery involves multiple stages and various healthcare professionals, and errors can occur at any point in the process, with a significant portion (38%) happening during the administration phase. Nurses, who spend approximately 40% of their time administering medications, serve as the final safeguard against errors before they reach patients, and hospitals often rely on them to report medication errors, as they may witness or be responsible for such errors.

In contrast to traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), which are typically trained using backpropagation algorithms, the extreme learning machine (ELM) initializes and fixes the weights for the hidden layer without iterative tuning. Activation functions are then applied to the hidden neurons, with the only parameters learned in ELM being the weights between the hidden layer and the output layer. This independence from the training data enables ELM to approach the near-optimal generalization bound of traditional FNNs, as demonstrated in theoretical studies.

Adding additional variables yields only marginal improvements in prediction ability, as indicated in sections 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3. Comprehensive visualizations for humans should only utilize a few variables, with some studies suggesting a limit of no more than four variables. Thus, additional screening rules are employed to determine which variable sets, derived from the selected top predictors, should be visualized. The criteria for selection include a limit of no more than four variables for visualization, as well as the consideration of whether adding another variable provides significant R-squared.

In conclusion, individuals with very high or very low levels of trust are both likely to report errors, while those with moderate or moderately low levels of peer trust are uncertain about reporting errors. The length of time the subjects have been working in the unit also influences their likelihood of reporting errors.

Subjects who are relatively new to the current unit (approximately 4 to 5 years) and are more willing to report errors appear to be relatively young and have relatively weak trust in their peers, hovering around the lower levels of trust for organizational trust questions and between 1 to 2 for warm climate questions.
