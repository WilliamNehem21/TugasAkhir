In open and distributed property-based access control systems, access rights are given based on certified properties presented. However, controlling agents do not rely solely on presented certified properties when making access decisions. Key factors include the relationships between certified properties, experiences and expectations regarding other participating agents, and resulting trust dynamics. This study identifies the crucial relationships and illustrates how they can be explicitly incorporated into access decisions.

To address the initial concern, we adopt a comprehensive perspective on trust. Rather than assuming a universal property scheme, controlling agents assess the trustworthiness of certifying agents. Consistent with prior proposals, each access control policy embodies the local trust dynamics of the respective controlling agent. It is evident that local trust dynamics are influenced by various local and global aspects of the underlying system. To tackle the second issue, our model accounts for the revocation of already certified properties, explicit access prohibitions, and declarations of trust and distrust concerning other agents.

We advocate for addressing doubt and distrust as well. Consequently, we broaden the definition of bound properties, such that trust on the part of an owner results in the issuance of a bound property considered a positive access right, while distrust leads to the issuance of a bound property classified as a negative access right. Thus, distrust does not entail the removal of a granted positive access right. Whenever an owner harbors doubts about a granted bound property, it is rescinded.

The evaluation is influenced by the expectations of the corresponding participant, denoted as "a". If the participant anticipates that assigner "ai" honestly certifies or will honestly certify property "pi", then a positive evaluation maps the assigner-property pair to trust, i.e., evala(ai, pi) = trust. Similarly, a negative evaluation maps the pair to distrust, and a neutral evaluation maps the pair to doubt. It is evident that the local eval- â‹¯ [the rest is truncated].
