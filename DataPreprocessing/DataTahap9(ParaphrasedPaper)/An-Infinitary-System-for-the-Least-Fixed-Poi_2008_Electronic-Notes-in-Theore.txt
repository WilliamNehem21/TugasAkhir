The concept of the least fixed-point of an operator is widely utilized in computer science, particularly in the domain of query languages for relational databases. To address issues related to the expressivity of first-order classical logic (FOL), extensions such as the least fixed-point logic (LFP) have been proposed. LFP captures the complexity class PTIME over the class of finite ordered structures, which is significant for characterizing computational classes and establishing normalization theorems for fragments of these systems. This paper introduces an infinitary deductive system for LFP restricted to finite models (LFPFIN), aiming to provide a proof theory for a logic traditionally studied within the scope of finite model theory. It also offers an alternative means of proving existing results within finite model theory and deriving new results from a proof-theoretical perspective.

In 1950, Trakhtenbrot's theorem marked the beginning of finite model theory, demonstrating that validity over finite models is not recursively enumerable, indicating incomplete coverage over finite models. This result was based on the assumption that any deductive system is inherently finite and recursive. However, this assumption is relaxed in the context of proof theory for arithmetic.

Inspired by the need to establish the consistency of first-order arithmetic through a proof-theoretical perspective, we propose an infinitary natural deduction system for FOL and LFP restricted to finite models (FOLFNF and LFPFIN), and prove their soundness and completeness, along with a normalization theorem for fragments of these systems. We also demonstrate that with some restrictions, this deductive system can be utilized in a theorem prover to compute queries on relational databases.

Section 2 presents a natural deduction system for FOLFNF, which includes classical first-order inference rules as well as additional rules to handle finite classical first-order models. Section 3 defines LFP through its semantics, and in Section 4, new rules are introduced to address the least fixed-point operator, leading to the definition of the LFPFIN system. The paper concludes with a presentation of a normalization procedure for fragments of FOLFNF and LFPFIN. This procedure involves a rewriting process to transform a derivation into a normal form by eliminating redundancy.

In summary, this paper introduces an infinitary natural deduction system for LFP restricted to finite models (LFPFIN), which is an extension of a similar system for FOL restricted to finite models (FOLFNF). We provide proofs of soundness and completeness for these systems, as well as a normalization theorem for their fragments.
