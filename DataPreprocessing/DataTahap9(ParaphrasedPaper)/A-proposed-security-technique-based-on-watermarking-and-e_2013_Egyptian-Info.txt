The utilization of watermarking techniques can serve to ensure the integrity and privacy of medical images without altering their diagnostic value. Reversible watermarking, a form of lossless data hiding, allows for the embedding of data within a digital image in a manner that enables full restoration of the original image. Recent research has increasingly advocated for the application of reversible watermarking in the context of preserving the integrity of medical images and safeguarding patient privacy.

An adaptive reversible watermarking technique for image authentication and self-correction is proposed in this paper. The technique involves dividing the image into a region of interest (ROI) and a region of non-interest (RONI), embedding the ROI into the RONI, and enabling the detection and restoration of any modifications made to the image by extracting the ROI from the RONI. The size of the ROI is dependent on the availability of clinical findings and their features in the medical image, while the RONI represents the background or non-clinical areas. This approach offers the advantage of dual robustness levels by combining reversible watermarking with robust watermarking. The watermarking method ensures robustness during the extraction process against JPEG compression, and it involves the concatenation of a digital signature derived from the ROI along with an authenticity code to form a primary code that is embedded within the RONI using the robust watermarking method. Furthermore, an additional code is embedded into the ROI to enhance the second level of robustness.

Another proposed scheme involves an adaptive data hiding technique for medical images utilizing integer wavelet transform. This technique employs integer wavelet transform for embedding multiple watermarks by decomposing the cover image to obtain wavelet coefficients. Prior to the watermark embedding process, an adaptive threshold is determined for each block through iterative optimization, thereby avoiding histogram pre and post-processing and reducing the distortion between the watermarked and original images. However, this method exhibits limitations such as low imperceptibility values at normal embedding capacity and its applicability only to grayscale images.

Furthermore, the paper introduces a multiple block-based authentication watermarking approach for the distribution of medical images, which aims to ensure the secure distribution of images and provide authentication for fragmented blocks containing significant clinical information. Additionally, a lossless watermarking-based medical image authentication method is proposed, integrating patient information and message authentication code through lossless compression. Despite its advantages in ensuring high-level security for patient information, this method inherits the disadvantage of altering the statistical property of the cover image, making the hiding process easily detectable by computer systems.

In addition, a reversible watermarking scheme based on image classification and histogram shifting is proposed, aiming to embed high-capacity data with low distortion. Moreover, a security technique based on encryption and watermarking is presented, which combines RC4 stream ciphers with LSB and QIM watermarking methods to protect medical images and achieve a large embedded capacity in the spatial domain.

The proposed techniques are accompanied by performance evaluation results when applied to grayscale DICOM images, color medical images, and grayscale and color test images. Although not designed for copyright protection, the techniques are demonstrated to be effective in detecting modifications to watermarked images, thereby ensuring image integrity and authentication.

Potential future enhancements to the proposed techniques include their integration into medical information systems to provide image integrity, system authentication, and confidentiality. Furthermore, exploring additional reversible watermarking methods to increase embedded data capacity, as well as investigating alternative lossless compression methods, could further improve the capabilities of the proposed techniques. Lastly, the utilization of public encryption techniques in place of AES encryption is suggested to enhance source authentication.
