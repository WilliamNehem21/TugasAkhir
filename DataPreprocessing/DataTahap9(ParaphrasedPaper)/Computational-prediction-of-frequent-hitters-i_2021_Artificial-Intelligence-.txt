The use of high-throughput screening (HTS) assay technologies is crucial in modern drug discovery as they enable the rapid testing of large numbers of compounds on specific targets of interest. However, a significant challenge in high-throughput screening is the occurrence of false-positive hits due to various types of assay interference.

Several computational methods have been developed to assess small molecules for their potential to form colloidal aggregates, which can interfere with assay results. These methods, such as aggregator advisor, chemagg, and scam detective, employ different techniques such as molecular similarity analysis and machine learning models to identify molecules prone to aggregation.

Another common cause of assay interference is the chemical reactivity of compounds, particularly with regard to electrophilicity. Computational approaches based on rule sets have been used to identify reactive compounds based on specific substructures linked to chemical reactivity.

The paper also discusses the challenges in modeling different types of assay data and the need for dedicated models for different assay sets. It describes the development and testing of various machine learning models using different training sets and classification methods, and highlights the importance of model robustness and performance in accurately predicting assay outcomes.

Additionally, the paper presents the performance of different machine learning algorithms in classifying compounds based on their biological activity, and emphasizes the significance of adjusting decision thresholds in classification based on the specific requirements of different use cases.

Finally, the paper discusses interferences with luciferase reporter enzymes and provides guidance on addressing these interferences, drawing on insights from the assay guidance manual and other relevant sources.
