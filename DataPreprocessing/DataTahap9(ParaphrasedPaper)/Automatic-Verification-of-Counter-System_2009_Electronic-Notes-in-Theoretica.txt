Certainly! Here is a paraphrased version of the academic paper:

In the general case, it is impossible to determine the final termination property conclusively, and certain strong assumptions must be considered to automate its verification. The termination problem is typically resolved by presenting a ranking function, which has been actively researched over the last three years within the scope of code analysis for imperative programs containing loops with integer variables. A comprehensive method for the synthesis of linear ranking functions in the limited class of single path loops has been developed in this context. This approach has recently been expanded to (single path) nested loops and has been implemented in the terminator tool, designed for the analysis of C code in hardware device drivers. An alternative approach is presented in which a semi-algorithm based on region graphs is proposed and applied to exclusive multiple-path loops. This approach is implemented in the PONes tool, which is dedicated to the verification of Java programs. Additionally, a method for synthesizing linear ranking functions for a broader range of systems, specifically integer-variable loops with multiple paths and non-exclusive guards, has been developed. The synthesis is based on enumerating all linear functions (represented as Presburger formulas). The method is complete; if a linear function exists, the procedure will eventually identify it. However, this work does not take parameters into account.

From this result, a procedure has been derived to automatically synthesize either Presburger-definable ranking functions or LPDS-definable ranking functions. The procedure will enumerate potential ranking functions and verify them. The procedure will terminate if and only if a Presburger-definable or an LPDS-definable ranking function exists. This proposed approach has been utilized to verify the final termination property of the ZCSP protocol. The method extends the aforementioned works, as our hypotheses are as general as, and the class of ranking functions we synthesize is larger than.

The ZCSP (Zero-Copy Secure Protocol) is a communication protocol implemented in the MPC parallel computer. Essentially, the ZCSP protocol is a variant of the BRP protocol, which has previously been extensively studied. In ZCSP, several messages may be emitted before their respective acknowledgments are received, and the acknowledgments may be received out of order. The emitted messages have to be stored until their own acknowledgment, as well as those of their predecessors, are received. This storage introduces greater complexity compared to the BRP protocol.

We provide a sketch of the proof. The abstraction represents an overestimation of the set of behaviors of ZCSP: files are represented as counters, and bounds on files are relaxed. Furthermore, messages are now atomic. This coarser representation does not miss any interleavings, as, in ZCSP, packets of a given message are sent atomically.

The last result suggests the enumeration (fairly and efficiently) of all Presburger functions and testing whether each Presburger function is a ranking function. This strategy will identify a ranking function if there exists a Presburger ranking function. Otherwise, the computation will not terminate, and in particular, a non-Presburger ranking function may exist.

We denote the set of LPDS functions as F_LPDS. For instance, f(x) = ci.x + dj, with ci in Z^k[p]^c and dj in Z^k[p], is an LPDS function. It is noteworthy that every (integer) linear function with a polyhedral convex domain is an LPDS function without parameters. The converse is evidently untrue.

When n = 0, we demonstrate that a state ranked at 0 has all its successors in "final": the system is deadlock-free. Therefore, the state has at least one successor, denoted as sâ€™. Assuming s' is not in "final," it is associated with a rank given by f(s'), and by definition of the ranking function, f(s') < f(s). As the co-domain of f is n, this results in a contradiction. It follows that every successor of s is in "final," and s satisfies the property of "final."

I hope this helps! Let me know if you need further assistance.
