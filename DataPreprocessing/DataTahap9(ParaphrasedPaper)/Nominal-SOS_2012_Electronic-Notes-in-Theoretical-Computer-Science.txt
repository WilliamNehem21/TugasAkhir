Nominal terms' subscripts control the sorting process, and we often leave them out when their meaning is clear from the surrounding context or not relevant. This is referred to as an abstraction. We have not provided a method to introduce pairs of terms, as we only utilize product sorts to assign a sort to transition relations (refer to section 3 for details).

The set fa(t) denotes the atoms a in a(t) that appear in t but are not within the scope of an abstraction [a]tj for some term tj. We refer to fa(t) as the set of free atoms of t. For instance, fa(f([a]g(a, b)))={b} and fa(g(f([a]a), a))={a}.

We define a nominal term as closed if it does not contain any variables, and open if it does. For instance, a and [a]f(b) are closed terms, while x and [a]y are open terms. It's important to note that neither a nor [a]f(b) is binding-closed.

It's worth noting that this definition represents the fundamental formulation of open bisimilarity, which does not involve distinctions. In Definition 5.2, it's crucial to emphasize that the ranging over all the substitutions is performed at each step of the bisimulation game.
