This paper focuses on the optimal control of inventory-production systems with items subject to Gumbel-distributed deterioration, and its application to optimal control theory. The model was successfully framed as a linear optimal control problem, and an explicit solution was obtained using the Pontryagin maximum principle, from which the optimality conditions were derived. The application of the model was illustrated through examples.

The study specifically addresses the inventory-production control problem, where the optimal control problem involves a state variable (inventory level) and a control variable (manufacturing rate) subject to deterioration over time. In this context, the deterioration of items and the variation in demand rate over time are key factors of interest. While previous research primarily focused on models with constant deterioration rates, this paper focuses on the application of optimal control theory to production planning with Gumbel-distributed deteriorating items. The effects of deterioration and demand rate variations on logistics are analyzed using optimal control theory, and the paper presents an optimal control model for inventory-production systems with generalized Gumbel-distributed deteriorating items. The explicit solution for optimal control models under a continuous review-policy was derived using the Pontryagin maximum principle, and numerical examples were provided to illustrate the optimal control of a production-inventory system with Gumbel-distributed deteriorating items.

The study also emphasizes the use of extreme value distributions (such as the Gumbel distribution) for assessing hazards such as landslides, earthquakes, and near-surface groundwater levels, highlighting the broader applications of this modeling approach.
