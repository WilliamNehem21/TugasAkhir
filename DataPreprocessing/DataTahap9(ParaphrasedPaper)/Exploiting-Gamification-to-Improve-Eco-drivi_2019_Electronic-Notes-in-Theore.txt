The gamecar project seeks to create an innovative and engaging serious games platform to encourage users to adopt an environmentally friendly driving style. This platform will employ a multidisciplinary approach to develop a user-friendly and unobtrusive gaming environment that incorporates both mobile devices and the car itself. By using data from an OBD sensor and considering environmental and physiological factors, the gamecar system aims to create an immersive and motivating experience for eco-driving. The system will be evaluated through test campaigns involving drivers at three different sites to assess its effectiveness and potential for practical use.

The aggressiveness ecoscore calculation is based on several driving parameters, including engine RPM variance, braking intensity, and acceleration magnitude. These parameters provide insights into driver behavior, such as nervousness and improper vehicle handling, thus impacting fuel efficiency, eco-friendliness, and overall safety. The gamecar system also includes different mission categories tailored to the user's driving style, such as aggressive, balanced, or safety-oriented, and is designed to incentivize and reward improvement in driving skills through a leveling system and various driving statistics.

The gamecar experience is divided into three main phases: discovery, on-boarding, and scaffolding. Each phase introduces the user to different game elements, feedback mechanisms, and driving statistics, gradually exposing them to more advanced features and missions as they progress through the levels. Additionally, users can create their own crews and receive personalized feedback and visualizations based on their driving performance, further customizing the game experience.

Driving skill scores are provided to users to assess their specific abilities in various aspects of driving, such as fuel consumption, acceleration, braking, gear changing, and driving aggression. These scores aim to facilitate user improvement and goal pursuit within the game, offering live feedback and recognition of their achievements. Knowledge cards and missions add another layer of gamification to the experience, providing opportunities for learning and collaboration among players.

Overall, the gamecar platform is designed to engage users in eco-friendly driving behaviors through an immersive and incentivizing gaming environment, leveraging data-driven insights to promote safer and more sustainable driving habits.
