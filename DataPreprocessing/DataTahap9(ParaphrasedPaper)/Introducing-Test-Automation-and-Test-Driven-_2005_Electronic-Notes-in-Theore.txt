This academic paper presents a method for testing software components that aims to detect defects earlier in the development process in a cost-effective manner. A department at Ericsson AB introduced a test automation tool for component-level testing in conjunction with the practice of test-driven development (TDD). This approach differs from the traditional use of TDD in extreme programming, as tests are written for components exchanging XML data rather than for individual methods within classes. The paper describes the implementation of the test automation tool, the integration of TDD, and the outcomes of the implementation. Initial results suggest a significant reduction in development lead time.

To answer specific questions, the authors analyzed previous improvement attempts and conducted a thesis study to identify ways to enhance test efficiency. The study involved qualitative and quantitative inquiries, analysis of project statistics, and a literature review. Qualitative and quantitative interviews with users of the new concept provided answers to other questions.

The study identified that finding and fixing defects becomes more costly the later they are discovered in the development process. Additionally, developers tended to put minimal effort into testing isolated components. As a result, the thesis recommended focusing improvement efforts on the basic test level.

The paper also discusses the technical aspects of the test automation tool, its integration with the development process, observations, and lessons learned. It highlights the decision to use C++ as the test case language and the importance of aligning the test strategy with the external design of each component.

Challenges related to implementing the new concept on existing products and the gradual development of tests for old functionality are also addressed. The authors emphasize the need for measurement, adherence to agreed processes, and the introduction of test automation in small steps to minimize risks. They also discuss the challenges of maintaining robust test cases and the complexities of test case generators.

Furthermore, the paper stresses the importance of a mature development process and managerial commitment to successfully implement test automation efforts. It outlines the benefits of the introduced test automation tool and the potential for decreased fault rates in projects.

Overall, the paper presents an approach to software component-level testing that incorporates test automation, TDD, and a focus on basic test improvements, with the goal of detecting defects earlier in the development process and reducing lead time.
