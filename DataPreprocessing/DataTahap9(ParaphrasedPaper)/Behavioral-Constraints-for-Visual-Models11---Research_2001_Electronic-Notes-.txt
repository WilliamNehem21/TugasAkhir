This paper examines the issue of ensuring consistency of behavioral models in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) and presents methods for specifying and analyzing consistency. The authors propose a general methodology that involves transforming UML model elements into a semantic domain through meta-model rules, and then specifying and validating consistency constraints using the language and tools of the semantic domain. The paper demonstrates this methodology by applying it to the problem of protocol statechart inheritance.

The main goal of the paper is to present an approach to specifying and verifying behavioral constraints for visual models. The authors outline a four-step process, which begins with identifying the consistency problem and selecting a semantic domain that supports the desired consistency requirements. Next, they define a mapping of models into the semantic domain and use the language and tools provided by the semantic domain to formulate behavioral constraints and verify them. The paper also includes an example of applying these techniques to the statechart of a class called "TraditionalPerson."

The paper also mentions the use of rule-based mappings in related works, such as the proposal of timed Petri nets as a semantic framework for the UML. The authors emphasize that their aim is not to provide a denotational semantics for the entire UML, but rather to define a mapping locally for the specific language features of interest, while keeping the mapping flexible and extensible for future modifications.

The authors suggest that a rule-based notation, along with a supporting tool capable of generating a translator from the rule-based description, could be valuable for modifying the notion of consistency as the development process evolves or new profiles are created. They are currently exploring the use of XSL transformations for this purpose.
