A commonly used method for analyzing complex technical systems involves ensemble classification methods. These methods are effective in constructing reliable decision rules for classifying features in the presence of numerous potential states of the system. This paper presents new techniques based on decision trees to assess power system reliability. The approach proposed in this work is a hybrid model based on random forests and boosting, which can be utilized to predict the impact of increasing renewable energy sources, energy storage devices, and intelligent switching of smart loads on the grid, thereby facilitating decision-making. The ensemble classification method is tested on a modified 118-bus IEEE power system to evaluate the system's security under steady-state operating conditions.

The paper is organized into six sections. Section 1 introduces the topic, while Section 2 presents the problem statement regarding security assessment. Section 3 discusses the use of ensemble decision tree-based learning for security assessment in power systems. Section 4 describes the preparation of a database, specifically considering power systems with high penetration of wind power generation and other distributed generation sources. Section 5 demonstrates the feasibility of the ensemble decision tree-based approach using an IEEE 118 test power system, and Section 6 concludes the paper.

Numerous studies have shown that machine learning methods, such as artificial neural networks, decision trees, and ensemble models, offer effective solutions to this problem. These studies are summarized and discussed in Zhou et al. Furthermore, Valiant and Kearns were the first to question if a weak learning algorithm can be strengthened to an arbitrarily accurate learning algorithm, a process known as boosting. Schapire developed the first provable polynomial-time boosting algorithm with the intent of converting weak models into strong models by constructing an ensemble of classifiers.

A different approach to classification and regression problems using ensembles was proposed by Breiman, which is an extension of the bagging idea. Additionally, progressive bagging-based approaches such as random forest have been shown to be effective modifications of both random forests and boosting algorithms.

Several applications involving ensemble decision trees have been addressed in real-time transient stability prediction and assessment, voltage security monitoring and estimation, loss of synchronism detection, timing of controlled separation in power systems, and more. These applications demonstrate the effectiveness of ensemble decision trees in different power system scenarios.

Automated modeling techniques are key to overcoming the challenges in developing security assessment models, as they allow for searching across techniques and tuning parameters within techniques. Additionally, meaningful voltage instability information is provided during dynamic disturbances in the system using local indicators.

In conclusion, the use of ensemble methods for complex technical systems analysis offers promising potential for improving decision-making processes in the power system domain.
