Various techniques have been utilized for lithofacies prediction using well-log data since the 1980s. However, in sections with multiple lithologies, well-log data often exhibits non-linear relationships with lithofacies, leading to unreliable and relatively inaccurate predictions. Artificial neural network models, particularly multi-layer perceptrons (MLP), are commonly employed to predict lithofacies classes from well-log data due to their ability to handle complex relationships. Additionally, neural networks have been combined with probabilistic and fuzzy classifier methods, as well as with a Markov transition matrix, to form Bayesian neural networks for lithofacies classification using well-log data (Feng, 2021).

An advantage of utilizing the gamma ray (GR) log attributes is their ability to better characterize the gradual transitions between lithofacies compared to using the GR data alone. To validate the lithofacies prediction performance of each model, a 5-fold cross-validation procedure was employed, dividing a dataset of 8911 data records into five compartments, with four assigned to the training subset and one to the testing subset. This procedure was repeated three times, resulting in 15 cases being evaluated, providing meaningful statistical assessments of the facies class prediction performance.

In cases where comprehensive inputs such as mineralogy, core analysis, and various well logs are not available due to cost and technical constraints, GR log attributes could serve as a reliable alternative for lithofacies characterization with the assistance of an ensemble of machine learning models. However, the machine learning models assessed in this study lack transparency in revealing how the facies class predictions are generated for each data record, which may be disadvantageous for outlier analysis and detailed data mining. An open-box machine learning algorithm has shown potential in predicting and data mining lithofacies datasets, and future studies are planned to apply this algorithm for more detailed lithofacies predictions.

GR log attributes, particularly derivative and volatility attributes, offer valuable features for improving lithofacies predictions in boreholes with limited well-log variables recorded. These attributes extract shape characteristics from GR curves that are not captured by the recorded log values, providing distinctive complementary features related to changes in GR curve shape with depth.
