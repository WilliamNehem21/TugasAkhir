0.246 grams of isonicotinic acid (2 mmol) and 0.332 grams of cobalt acetate tetrahydrate (1 mmol) were added to an agate mortar and ground together continuously for 15 minutes. The resulting light pink powder was then washed with methanol to eliminate any residual starting material, and subsequently dried at room temperature. Quantitative analysis of the X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) patterns of compound 1 and malonic acid indicated the appearance of new peaks in compound 1 that were not present in the malonic acid ligand, implying the formation of a new phase. This suggests the complexation of malonic acid with cobalt acetate. Similarly, the XRPD patterns of compound 2 differed from those of the isonicotinic acid ligand. The peaks observed for the isonicotinic acid ligand were located at...
