Projected future access requirements somewhat resemble self-organized ad-hoc networks built upon autonomous system control. Several organizations have explored developing pathways and other forms of organic architecture within their establishment to create the most convenient design for efficient movement. This kind of architectural innovation was previously unattainable due to the substantial power, cooling, engineering, and mass associated with traditional storage area networks. 

Physical security is a constant concern for data centers, server rooms, and other locations where computational resources are deployed. When it comes to Internet of Things devices, this concern takes on an added dimension. Traditionally, a malicious actor gaining access to the compute cluster could potentially access the storage or cause catastrophic failure by destroying the systems. However, the inexpensive deployment of organic clusters, along with their capability to replicate complete data storage across hundreds of devices, can prevent catastrophic data loss in many instances. If five out of ten pods are damaged, the organization's workload is automatically redistributed to the remaining pods. Each node's storage can be encrypted using 256-bit encryption within distributed or protected key centers, accessible from almost any system, ranging from Wi-Fi-enabled modules to cloud-based solutions. In the event of a malicious attack resulting in the theft of an entire pod, the encryption keys would render the information inaccessible. The replacement cost of an entire pod would be less than $1000 USD.

This system will be analyzed against an existing storage area network that is five years old using common analysis tools available to network and system administrators. These tests will be conducted in a live production environment over the course of one year, with the next analysis scheduled at approximately 400 days. Following this, an assessment will be provided for discussion and further recommendations.

Supported by a small consumer solar panel array, such as the Bluetti SP120, which generates around 120 watts of power, the organic cluster is well within the reach of a solar-powered environmental scope. The relationship between power, production, maintenance, and cost would be considered to ensure the system falls within a sustainable realm.

Design science is the pursuit of research for intentional design methods and the scientific documentation of processes and results for the advancement of the scientific community. Similar to qualitative or quantitative spheres that scrutinize the existence of things, design science delves into pre-existing concepts and transforms them into reality through creation and innovation. The Design Science Research Methodology (DSRM) provides a framework to generate a solution based on a set of needs, referred to as an artifact. Artifacts are imperative in the design science research process, as they embody the created form of a solution. Throughout the process, the artifact undergoes a design, evaluation, revision process until a definitive outcome can be ascertained or until the research is concluded. By merging exploratory and experimental methods, design science research produces an artifact that offers the opportunity for descriptive and explanatory methods.

The initial iterations of the primary artifact were developed using the GlusterFS system on virtual machines (VMs) and physical lab computers. After verification that Gluster would function effectively in a Linux Mint VM environment, 24 physical machines were constructed and deployed in a laboratory. Several reliability tests were conducted by disabling between 1 and 10 systems in the cluster without issue. GlusterFS was able to recover without external intervention in each attempt, thus validating the creation of the low-power organically distributed artifact.

Linux Mint 20 was installed on each of the four AtomicPis using an external USB flash drive. Following installation, the storage was formatted using XFS, chosen for its reported performance with large file sizes and multi-threaded installations on lower-performance systems. SSH was enabled, and public-private key pairs were created for remote access to the devices. These keys or new keys could be used for the LUKS cryptfs file system, if desired. GlusterFS was then installed with a single brick per node.

The network load was increased to test the round-robin load balancer in DNS. After the research period, each node underwent a reboot with a five-minute interval to allow automatic discovery and synchronization with the entire cluster pod. Following the reboot, another performance test was initiated for comparison.

Once the final diagnostic was completed on the unmodified cluster, a reboot was performed to provide a fresh platform for analysis using the same method as the initial and final diagnostics. Prior to the test, an uptime command was run against the cluster to verify the uptime and overall utilization. It should be noted that only 23 systems were available to download the diagnostic image from the cluster at the time it was rebooted.

Changes in current technological capabilities and the growing need for local data control and availability may lead to a shift from cloud storage to local or hybrid storage solutions. This shift may not necessarily be due to a deliberate move away from cloud computing because of privacy, cost, or performance issues, but rather an opportunity to have secure, local access to organizational data at on-site facilities. Developing countries stand to benefit from the development of ecological systems that utilize alternative power sources. These opportunities, combined with mounting concerns over data security in the cloud for some organizations, may drive a technical migration of data back to the organizations from where it was originally stored.
