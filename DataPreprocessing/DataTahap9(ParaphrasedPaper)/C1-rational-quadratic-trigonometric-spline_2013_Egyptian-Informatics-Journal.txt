Rational trigonometric interpolating splines with tension (shape parameters) are the preferred choice because they can interpolate the same data using both straight lines and curves. These tension parameters do not impact the continuity order of the spline. Additionally, the rational structure of these splines enables them to handle singularities. In practice, the data collected, whether through physical observations or experimentation, typically exhibits at least one of the shape properties, such as positivity, monotonicity, and convexity. Examples of positive data-generating sources include measurements of rainfall, gas discharge, and exponential functions. For a given set of positive data, the paths defined by the functions rk(x), where k ranges from 0 to 3, are non-negative, and their simple summation yields a value of at least 1. This property establishes the convex hull property, ensuring that the curve always lies within the convex hull of the control points.

Proof: Assuming the given set of positive data is {(x0, f0), (x1, f1), ..., (xn, fn)}, where xi < xi+1 and fi > 0 for i = 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1, the curve produced by the interpolation of positive data with uniform knots is denoted as c1, while for non-uniform knots it is denoted as c0. In references [14, 15], it was noted that the order of continuity depended on the multiplicity of knots and shape parameters. Specifically, c1-continuity was determined by the knot vectors and the choice of derivatives, with the derivatives restricted to di for tangent continuity. However, the data encountered in most applications is non-uniform and does not restrict the derivatives, rendering these schemes inapplicable to a wide range of functions where derivative preservation is essential. In contrast, the order of continuity of the rational quadratic trigonometric spline presented in this paper is independent of knot spacing, the slope of the secant line, and the shape parameters.
