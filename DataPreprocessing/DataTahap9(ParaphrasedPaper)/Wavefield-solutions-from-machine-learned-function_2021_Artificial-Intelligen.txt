As a result, while a larger network can yield more accurate wavefields, a perfectly scattered wavefield is not essential for gradient calculation in velocity model update applications. Despite a fourfold increase in network model parameters, training a 12-layer network incurs a 50% higher cost compared to a 10-layer network. Conversely, the training cost of an 8-layer network is approximately two-thirds of that of a 10-layer network, even though the number of network parameters is only one-fourth. In summary, using this network architecture, adding two layers of double the size of the initial layer results in a 50% increase in training cost and a higher resolution wavefield.
