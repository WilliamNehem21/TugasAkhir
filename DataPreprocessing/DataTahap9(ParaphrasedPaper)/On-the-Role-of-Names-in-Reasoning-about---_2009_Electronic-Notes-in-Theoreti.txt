The permutation action on variables is considered an identity, assuming that variables always have empty support. This allows us to avoid explicitly representing permutations at the term level. The dependency of a variable on names can be encoded using a technique called raising.

The definition of open bisimulation involves quantification over substitutions. A direct encoding would explicitly formalize name substitution. However, a more concise encoding can be achieved using quantifiers of logic, which has been used in prior work. For details on the use of quantifier alternations to encode distinctions and to avoid explicit encodings of substitutions, the reader is referred to the previous work.
