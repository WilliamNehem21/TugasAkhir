The advancement of our society's digitalization is dependent on the availability of secure and dependable software systems that oversee critical ongoing processes, such as critical information infrastructures. Understanding the interdependencies of events and processes is crucial for ensuring cybersecurity and software reliability. Process mining, a set of techniques that aims to extract essential knowledge from processes, shows promise in addressing these challenges by providing additional perspectives and temporal context for interpreting data and understanding processes. However, it remains unclear how process mining can be practically utilized to aid in addressing cybersecurity and reliability concerns.

In this paper, we investigate the potential of process mining to support cybersecurity and software reliability research efforts. Specifically, we gather existing process mining applications, examine current trends, and identify promising research directions that can be utilized to address current cybersecurity and software reliability challenges. To achieve this, we conduct a systematic literature review covering 35 relevant research approaches to analyze the current utilization of process mining for these tasks, identify the research gaps, and highlight promising research directions in this area. This work builds upon our previous study, which focused solely on cybersecurity, and acknowledges the close relationship and shared goals between the two fields.

Process mining techniques have proven successful in areas such as fraud detection, robotic process automation, and learning analytics. Furthermore, process mining has found favor in governing safety-critical processes, such as in healthcare, where it supports critical hospital processes and patient treatment.

The paper proceeds with a background of process mining in Section 2, an overview of existing literature reviews on process mining in other areas in Section 3, formulation of research questions and methodology in Section 4, details on the usage of process mining to ensure cybersecurity in Section 5, the application of process mining for software reliability in Section 6, results of the review and answers to research questions in Section 7, a discussion of threats to the validity of the review in Section 8, and a conclusion in Section 9.

We identified 35 processes employing process mining in cybersecurity or software reliability that are categorized based on the research problem they address. These include security of industrial control systems, security of smartphones, web-application security, network traffic security, attack inspection, outlier user behavior, fraud detection, error detection, and quality assurance. Despite some overlaps in the research approaches for both fields, there are notable differences, such as a higher number of publications in cybersecurity compared to software reliability, as well as a greater diversity of application domains in cybersecurity.

Our review also suggests several research gaps and potential directions for further investigation. For instance, there is a dearth of process mining exploration in domains outside of industrial control systems, smartphones, web applications, and network traffic security. Additionally, there is untapped potential for the application of process mining in areas such as availability, robustness, or resilience, which are currently underexplored in the context of cybersecurity and software reliability.

Finally, while our systematic approach aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of existing research and applications of process mining in cybersecurity and software reliability, some trends, patterns, and research gaps might have been overlooked. Nevertheless, we believe that our work offers a valuable summary of the existing body of knowledge in applying process mining in these areas, providing a foundation for further research and development in the field. We encourage the research community to delve deeper into critical information infrastructures, real-time system analysis, and the use of process-oriented approaches to enhance cybersecurity and prevent cyberattacks and incidents.
