In recent years, there has been a notable increase in the implementation of traditional desktop applications as rich internet applications (RIAs), such as mail clients, office software, and photo editing tools, made accessible online. The primary advantages of online applications include their easy deployment and maintenance from the perspective of developers.

During the ITiCSE 2006 conference, a working group examined the integration of algorithm visualizations with hypertext and emphasized the significance of visualization-based hypertextbooks in promoting the adoption of algorithm animation in teaching. The group highlighted features such as seamless visualization integration, enhanced student engagement, and the provision of a richer learning environment through the integration of content management system (CMS) features and aesthetics.

One specific implementation stemming from the group's ideas is the Extensible Algorithm Animation Language (XAAL), which facilitates describing animations at various levels of abstraction, using graphical primitives and transformations or data structures and operations. The aim of XAAL and its supporting tools is to enable the easy conversion of algorithm animation systems between different formats and platforms, addressing a significant research challenge within the realm of software visualization.

From a purely technical standpoint, numerous RIA technologies have been introduced, enabling the creation of complex applications that run within web browsers. This paper primarily focuses on JavaScript, while acknowledging the existence of alternative technologies. The field of JavaScript development has seen the emergence of numerous libraries, including Dojo, MooTools, Prototype, Scriptaculous, jQuery, and Google Web Toolkit, which have gained widespread popularity.

Despite the advancements, some challenges persist. Platform-specific issues may arise, although JavaScript libraries have facilitated the development of browser-independent code. Additionally, compatibility issues with Internet Explorer and potential conflicts when using JavaScript libraries other than Prototype in HTML documents have been identified as noteworthy concerns for current learning environments. Moreover, the inherent nature of JavaScript makes all source code accessible to students, posing reliability issues for client-side assessment in educational settings.

While JavaScript is commonly used in building rich internet applications, other promising technologies are also available. The decision to utilize JavaScript is justified by its open source nature, cross-platform compatibility without requiring plugins, and flexibility in integrating with server-side components, making it a mature and well-supported technology with a growing array of useful libraries.
