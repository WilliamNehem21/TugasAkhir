Several formalisms have established translations to and from hybrid automata. An informal translation of a hybrid automaton to hypa is defined in one work, while another work presents a formal transformation of a hybrid automaton and the parallel composition of hybrid automata to acpsrt, along with a proof of correctness. Additionally, another work demonstrates that linear hybrid action systems are a strict subclass of linear hybrid automata and defines a translation of a linear hybrid action system to a linear hybrid automaton, complete with a proof of correctness.

In addition to specifying delays using delay predicates, arbitrary delays can be described using the "any delay" operator [p], where p represents a process term. This results in behavior permitting arbitrary delays; when [p] delays, it remains unchanged and the delay behavior of p is ignored, while the action behavior of p remains unchanged in [p]. When [p] performs an action, the any delay operator disappears.

To facilitate the hierarchical modeling of systems, local declarations of variables, channels, and recursion definitions are useful. To this end, the process instantiation process term lp(xk, hm, en) is introduced, allowing for the (re)use of a process definition. A process definition is specified once but can be instantiated multiple times, potentially with different parameters: external variables xk, external channels hm, and expressions en. Specifications using process instantiations lp(xk, hm, en) have a specific structure.

The process of receiving parts by the assembly process is modeled through the use of the parallel composition (a? x b? y c? z), ensuring that each part is received as soon as possible. The parallel composition terminates when all parts have been received.

The primary distinction between these semantics lies in the labeling of the action and time transitions. In timed transition systems, the labels of action transitions only consist of the events of the hybrid automaton, whereas the labels of the action transitions of a hybrid transition system also include the valuations of the model variables before and after the action. For time transitions, the labels in a timed transition system only contain the duration of the time transition, whereas time transitions in hybrid transition systems also feature the trajectory of the model variables as a label. Finally, a timed transition system can have multiple initial states, whereas a hybrid transition system only has one initial state, capturing the behavior of all initial states of the timed transition system.

This can result in HAU automata that do not contain urgent transitions, as the semantics of the HAU definition allow transitions to be urgent, while in the linear hybrid I/O-automata, they cannot. It is worth noting that a formalized relation between linear hybrid I/O-automata and HAU automata has been presented in previous work.
