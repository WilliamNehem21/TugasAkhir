In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the complexity of theories and specifications attempted in provers. For instance, provers have been used to specify the formal semantics of programming languages such as Java, resulting in proof scripts that are tens of thousands of lines long, with hundreds of strategies developed to prove thousands of theorems. 

In a military C4I context, various agents (e.g., generals, battleships, tanks) share common characteristics in their infospheres, such as position, disposition, and communication, but interact with different types of agents. 

The kind theory is employed to specify the semantics of reusable artifacts in collaborative environments, where the artifacts represent subcomponents of proof scripts and proofs. The formalization of the semantic context and user interface features is influenced by the grammar of the proof script language. 

Several theorem proving environments, including Jape and CtCoq, have been utilized as testbeds for user interface and human-computer interaction. Innovations originally introduced in specialized environments have been incorporated into general-purpose front-ends. 

Pcoq, a Java-based user interface for Coq, shares some features with the discussed work, featuring a rich graphical interface and structured editing and presentation mechanisms. However, it has not evolved as a user interface for Coq. 

Isawin is another environment with advanced interactive features, focusing on an iconic graphical representation of mathematical constructs with a drag-and-drop interactive metaphor. 

Commercial general-purpose computation environments like Mathematica, Maple, and Matlab provide user interfaces with mathematical fonts and direct editing of terms using a point-and-click, drag-and-drop approach. While not attempting to replicate such user interfaces, the visual features are inspiring for theorem provers, despite their editing features being inferior to more sophisticated environments.

Coupling an advanced user interface like Mathematica with a prover like PVS is an interesting experiment, but it proves to be awkward due to the lack of both tools being designed as reusable components. Instead, features found to be useful in commercial mathematics environments are studied, adopted, adapted, and formalized for theorem provers. 

The second-level concepts of PVS, used to define top-level concepts, include theory formals, import and export relations between theories, assumptions, declarations, judgments, and conversions. 

The underlying kind context of the integrated mathematical environment (IME) is determined by the set of all identified kinds, which is fixed for a given proof script language and IME combination.

In the IME, all documents loaded by a user are parsed to identify instances in the current semantic context. While a parser exists in the back-end prover of the IME, front-end parsers are often used in such cases where no published API exists for accessing information from the back-end parser.

Extended implicit hyperlinking, a feature new to commercial development environments, involves functionalities like automated spell-checking found in tools like Emacs or Microsoft Word, where the source document is implicitly hyperlinked to dictionaries for spelling correction and definition and synonym lookup.

The PVS LaTeX printer, driven from typechecked specifications, allows substitutions to be made based on resolution information and can distinguish operators based on arity and theory. Pretty-printing tools for embedding different logics in PVS are also available, but integrating them into common Lisp can be challenging.

The integrated environment, an extension of the Emacs code browser (ECB), displays a customizable set of windows for browsing directories, files, and file contents related to the current semantic context. It also supports shortcut menus using the Imenu facility built into recent versions of Emacs.

Currently, the Wisent parser does not work with the X-Symbol package, which limits users from having a symbolic representation of PVS proof scripts while using the integrated environment. Efforts are being made to resolve this limitation before the release of the new PVS.

Improving support for completion and summarization of parameterized theories in PVS is recognized as an important research topic, with potential to be characterized by kind theoretical composition operators.

New features for PVS, such as refactoring capabilities, aim to enhance its capabilities, enabling operations such as safe renaming of program features, function extraction and insertion, and modification of feature visibility.
