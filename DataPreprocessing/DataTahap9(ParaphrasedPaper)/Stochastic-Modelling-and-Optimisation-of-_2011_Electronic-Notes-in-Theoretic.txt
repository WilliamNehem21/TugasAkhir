This academic paper discusses the use of internet auctions as a method for exchanging goods with non-fixed prices. The paper provides a theoretical analysis of fixed-time forward auctions, comparing the economic benefits and surpluses for buyers and sellers in auctions where a single bid or multiple bids are accepted. Simulation experiments based on various operational assumptions are used to verify the theoretical models, and decision rules for optimizing surplus under different auction fee structures are also presented.

The paper also explores the impact of sniping on online auctions, as well as the use of auction terminations such as soft close to counteract sniping behavior. Empirical investigations of eBay auctions of coins are conducted, examining the influence of seller ratings and auction duration on final prices. The effects of positive and negative seller ratings on auction prices are found to be asymmetrical, with negative ratings having a greater adverse influence on prices.

Mathematical models and simulation experiments are used to analyze the economic benefits to buyers and sellers in auctions with multiple lots and multiple accepted bids. The concept of allocative efficiency is introduced to compare the performance of auctions with multiple accepted bids to those with singularly accepted bids. A simulation process implemented in C++ is used to validate the theoretical findings based on observed values.

Furthermore, the paper discusses the critical dependence of auction income on the number of competing bids, as well as the effect of parameters on bidder collusion and seller shilling behaviors. The paper suggests that sellers can optimize their surplus by adjusting the auction duration and the number of bids accepted per auction, and that the average number of bids is a key determinant of performance. Simulations closely align with the theoretical analysis throughout the paper.
