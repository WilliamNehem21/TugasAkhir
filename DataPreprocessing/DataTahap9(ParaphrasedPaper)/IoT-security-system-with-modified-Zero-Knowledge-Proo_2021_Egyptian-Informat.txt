The advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to lead to an increase in the number of connected devices, which in turn will complicate security systems. Encryption and authentication are identified as crucial aspects of security systems. Various encryption techniques have been developed to address security issues, and zero knowledge proof is one method used for data authentication, enabling the verification of a statement without revealing any knowledge about the statement itself. This paper aims to address the security of data transmission systems by integrating data encryption and authentication. The proposed approach involves utilizing advanced encryption methods and implementing zero knowledge proof for data authentication. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, experiments are conducted to compare its performance with previous methods, using 30 test data sets to measure the encryption and authentication processes. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits faster processing speeds for securing data transmission systems, with authentication taking approximately 5 milliseconds from both the client and server sides.

Ensuring the security of data transmitted over the internet is crucial for maintaining confidentiality, integrity, and availability for users. This includes safeguarding various types of data such as statistics, financial information, and privacy data. Inadequate security measures can lead to data breaches, potentially enabling unauthorized access to plaintext data. Therefore, this paper introduces an algorithm to enhance data protection by incorporating encryption techniques into the authentication process using zero knowledge proof.

Furthermore, the paper emphasizes the significance of employing strong encryption algorithms in security systems. It discusses the use of the Rijndael algorithm, which is a highly efficient and secure encryption method developed by John Daemen and Vincent Rijmen from Katholieke University Leuven. The adoption of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) as a replacement for the Data Encryption Standard (DES) is also highlighted, with AES being recognized for its efficiency and security in both hardware and software implementations.

The paper elaborates on the complex nature of solving the discrete logarithm problem and its relevance to cryptographic operations. It discusses the challenges associated with finding solutions to the discrete logarithm problem and highlights the importance of modular arithmetic in cryptography due to its effectiveness in handling calculations involving large numbers.

In summary, the paper puts forward a novel approach that integrates zero knowledge proof authentication with advanced encryption methods to enhance the security of data transmission systems. The methodology proposed in this paper has been validated through simulations, demonstrating significantly improved performance and broader range of applicability compared to existing methods.
