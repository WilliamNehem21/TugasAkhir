Glue-laminated timber (glulam) is created by bonding together thin slats of standardized thickness. By varying the number of slats and their length, it is feasible to produce beams of nearly any dimension. The width of the slats determines the width of the beams, and these slats are cut from trunks, dried, and inspected for defects. By using fingerjointing, it is possible to produce slats of nearly any length. The slats are then stacked with glue and pressed, aligning the slats and hardening the glue. Furthermore, it is possible to extend slats with filling material in order to comply with the constraints of the press, which is later removed and treated as waste due to its short length. As a result, efforts are made to minimize the use of filling material in the pressing steps.

In this paper, we introduce new algorithms for each step of the glulam production process and provide a theoretical rationale for their efficiency. We decompose the problem into smaller steps, enabling the selection of independent algorithms for each step and increasing flexibility. Although each step is NP-hard, we focus on fast heuristics that produce satisfactory results in practice. Our approach is summarized in Section 5, along with numerical results demonstrating the ability to plan multiple months of production in just a few minutes. Our solutions achieve minimal filling material and a reduced number of height changes.

We build upon the algorithm proposed by Ackermann and Dinges (2017) to develop improved algorithms for each step, along with theoretical justification for their efficiency. Our proposed algorithms are further supplemented by the theoretical analysis and extended numerical results presented in Diessel's (2018) bachelor thesis.

Leoff (2016) developed an exact algorithm based on mixed-integer programming with a specialized branch-price-and-cut scheme, specifically focusing on relaxing constraints related to the sequential appearance of items from one order. Our packing problem can be seen as a special case of the two-dimensional variable-sized bin-packing problem as analyzed by Pisinger and Sigurd (2005), although the running time of their algorithms is not suitable for our application.

In this paper, we initially address the packing of single orders and subsequently explore combinations of up to three orders in the production planning. By leveraging theoretical considerations, such as Theorem 1, we reduce the packing problem to a simpler partitioning problem, which we solve using the largest difference method. Our approach allows for the efficient packing of combinations of orders while minimizing the use of extra filling material.

Our method involves finding packings for combinations of up to three orders, with a focus on limiting the size of the orders to maintain computational feasibility. Through extensive testing, we have identified thresholds that strike a balance between running time and solution quality, taking into account the trade-offs related to filling material and height changes. Additionally, we have observed diminishing returns in reducing filling material with an increased number of customers per planning. This allows for considering different heuristics for each step, facilitating the evaluation of their impact on the final result and finding an optimal balance between running time and solution quality.

Overall, our approach offers a flexible and systematic framework for optimizing the production planning of glulam, allowing for the exploration of various heuristics and the automatic allocation of running time to different steps based on specific problem requirements.
