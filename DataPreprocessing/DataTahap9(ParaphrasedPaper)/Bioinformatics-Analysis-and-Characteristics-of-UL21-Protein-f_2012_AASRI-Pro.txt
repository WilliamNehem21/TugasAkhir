Duck virus enteritis (DVE), also known as duck plague (DP), is a highly contagious and deadly viral disease affecting all ages of anseriformes, leading to significant economic losses due to high mortality rates and reduced egg production in commercial settings. The causative agent, duck enteritis virus (DEV), belongs to the alphaherpesvirinae subfamily, but it has not been classified into any genus by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). While previous research has focused on the epidemiology, diagnosis, prevention, and structural and morphogenetic aspects of DEV, recent studies have employed molecular biology technology to investigate DEV gene expression, protein purification, protein function, and detective studies. 

Various herpesviruses share a similar structure, with the herpes simplex virion comprising a core, capsid, tegument, and envelope, the tegument being composed of approximately 20 proteins. Among these proteins, the HSV-1 ul21 gene product, a tegument protein associated with the capsid, has been shown to promote the outgrowth of long cellular processes when over-expressed in non-neural cells, with physical association with microtubules. While both HSV and PRV ul21 gene products are not essential for viral replication in cultured cells and their deletion only marginally reduces titers but clearly decreases plaque sizes, the PRV ul21 gene is a major determinant of PRV virulence, with point mutations in the live vaccine strain Bartha contributing to its attenuated phenotype. However, studies on the DEV ul21 gene product are currently limited.

Protein function is related to its secondary structure, with alpha helices having higher chemical bonding energy and maintaining protein structure, primarily playing a role in DNA binding motifs but less often serving as B cell epitopes due to their difficulty in binding antibodies and their location within the protein's interior. On the other hand, extended strands and random coils provide more flexibility and often contain B cell dominant epitopes due to their looser texture and easier exposure on the protein surface. The DEV ul21 protein consists of 44.56% alpha helix, 13.55% extended strand, and 41.89% random coil, indicating the potential presence of B cell epitopes in extended strand and random coil structures. Previous findings on herpes simplex tegument proteins being processed for antigen presentation in vivo and their potential as candidate compounds for herpes simplex vaccines, along with 20 main antigenic determinants in epitope analysis, further suggest that the ul21 protein may be a potential candidate for DEV vaccines aimed at preventing and diagnosing duck virus enteritis.
