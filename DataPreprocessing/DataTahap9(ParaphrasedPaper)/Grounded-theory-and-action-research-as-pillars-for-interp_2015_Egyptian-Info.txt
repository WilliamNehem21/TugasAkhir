In summary, action research (AR) aims to provide practical solutions to real-world problems and advance scientific knowledge, particularly in situations where precise research questions are difficult to formulate. AR is a participative research approach that empowers participants to become researchers, fostering a hands-on learning process that benefits all involved. It offers a guiding model for monitoring and enhancing the progress of research projects through iterative stages, allowing for the emergence of new theories. These characteristics justify the selection of AR for evaluating e-government systems.

Moreover, the AR process involves several steps, including the description step, where the researcher describes socially shared realities and conducts interviews to gather detailed information. Another step involves reviewing objectives, designing a process, and determining tasks, schedules, and evaluation items. Flexibility is key to adapt to unforeseen effects and constraints.

The academic paper also discusses a case study of the Universal Enrollment System (UES) in Egypt, detailing the situation before and after the service was initiated. The UES replaced a traditional paper-based process with a web-based application, and its implementation and impact were evaluated through various phases, including service surveying and description steps.

Additionally, the research delves into research paradigms, interpretive research, and compares grounded theory and action research concepts. Finally, the paper proposes and applies frameworks for evaluating e-government systems to the UES, namely the Government E-Service Framework (GEF) and the Action Research Evaluation Framework (AREF).
