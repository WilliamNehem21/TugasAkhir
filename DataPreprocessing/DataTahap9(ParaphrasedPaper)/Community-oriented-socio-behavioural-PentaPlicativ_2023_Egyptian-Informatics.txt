The protection of data as it traverses through networks is critically important. In the rapidly evolving landscape of software development, cybersecurity is increasingly prominent, as it is a perpetual concern due to ongoing threats from malicious actors. This study focuses on securing data within social networks through the introduction of a new encryption method known as the pentaplicative cipher technique, which utilizes multiple keys to ensure the secure transmission of messages. Comparisons between the triplicative and pentaplicative cipher techniques are made in terms of their space and time complexity.

When a message is transmitted, it is either delivered to the intended destination node or forwarded to the next-hop node. To enhance the security of message transmission, the proposed approach ensures that a node forwards a message only to a neighboring node with a higher delivery probability. The objective is to maintain secure message transmission between nodes and between nodes and the base station.

Real-time communication necessitates a cryptographic technique that is both fast and secure. To achieve this, the study opts for symmetric-key cryptography, which ensures promptness and security through the use of private keys for message encryption and decryption. Emphasizing the importance of privacy, the study proposes an architectural framework controlled solely by the patient, incorporating access control and mandatory access control models.

In the context of electronic health records (EHRs), the study examines existing cloud-based security and privacy models and highlights the computational challenges of attribute-based encryption variants. The authors advocate for solutions to improve efficiency and suggest that auditing could offer valuable insights for protecting the privacy of all stakeholders.

The security of data exchange remains a significant challenge. To address this, the study presents an innovative approach that combines cryptography and steganography to enhance the impenetrability of the cryptographic process. Additionally, a lightweight block cipher called Scenery is introduced, utilizing bitslice techniques for efficient hardware and software implementation.

Crypompk, another algorithm proposed in the paper, focuses on granular server application protection. It employs information flow analysis and memory protection keys to safeguard sensitive memory buffers and operations.

The pentaplicative cipher technique, an advanced version of the triplicative cipher, employs five private keys to perform mathematical operations on plaintext, ensuring secure transmission. An improved version of this technique is designed to automate the end-to-end message delivery system between nodes and the base station, simplifying the cryptosystem.

The study also discusses the encoding and decoding processes, emphasizing the need to seamlessly integrate and automate key generation and message transmission. The authors present performance analysis results for key generation operations using the enhanced Diffie-Hellman approach, demonstrating the efficiency of the cryptographic technique.
