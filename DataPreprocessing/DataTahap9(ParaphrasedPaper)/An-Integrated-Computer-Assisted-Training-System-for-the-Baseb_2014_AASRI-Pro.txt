The study developed a color-coded zone bitmap that corresponds in size to the background image of a ball field. The color of the landing spot of the ball in the appropriate zone map is used to determine which fielder should catch the ball, thereby eliminating any ambiguity among fielders. The decision-making process also takes into account factors such as the ball hit status, the presence of runners on base, the number of outs, and the result of the batting play, including single, double, triple, fly out, and bunt. The researchers provided 18 commonly encountered training examples to simplify the case selection process.

Despite the multitude of diverse and complex scenarios in baseball games, the decision-making method focuses on common cases to ensure that fielders make no mistakes. The method is contingent on the ball's landing location and movement and involves the appropriate positioning of players on the field, followed by the division of the play into intervals for evaluation and adjustment, if necessary, in accordance with the national team standard paradigm. The study integrates and applies these standard paradigms into an internal system structure.

In certain situations, the method may require selecting more than one cutoff man if there are multiple runners or other complicating factors. The communication efficiency of the strategy cases is enhanced through storage as digital files, allowing for permanent preservation, repetitive review, sharing, and easy reediting. The animation platform developed using the hierarchy design method is also easily applicable to various other sports.
