The interest in developing AI social agents with sophisticated behaviors capable of engaging in social interactions has increased. Behavior trees have been widely utilized to create complex behaviors for AI social agents, and they can be represented as cognitive scripts, allowing for further development through repeated exposure to particular behaviors. However, the main challenge lies in the costly process of retrieving contextually similar behavior trees from a collection of scripts to facilitate the learning process. To address this issue, this paper presents a novel approach utilizing the map-and-reduce technique to efficiently retrieve cognitive scripts with low computational time and memory allocation. The study focuses on designing a corpus of cognitive scripts and applying map-and-reduce with semantic information to retrieve contextually similar cognitive scripts, demonstrating a high retrieval accuracy of 92.6% and cost-effectiveness compared to other techniques.

Many research efforts have been dedicated to improving the learning process in behavior trees using machine learning and graph theory. However, existing works assume the presence of the behavior trees of interest, neglecting the need to search for similar behavior trees for learning purposes. Recent research has emphasized the retrieval of contextually similar behavior trees for cross-learning to occur, a topic that has not been thoroughly explored. Representing behavior trees as cognitive scripts facilitates this retrieval process and allows for cross-learning between behavior trees.

The study incorporates contextual information in JSON files associated with the scripts to expedite the retrieval process. Additionally, the corpus includes general contextual information for 2000 common English words stored in .txt files, which can be automatically updated as new scripts containing new words are received. This design enhances the agility of the script retrieval process.

Behavior trees have been widely used to represent complex behaviors of social intelligent agents, focusing on socially accepted behavior or predicting future behavior in specific domains or scenes. However, there has been limited consideration for learning between similar domains, hindering the enrichment of behavior trees and the emergence of new behaviors beyond pre-canned actions.
