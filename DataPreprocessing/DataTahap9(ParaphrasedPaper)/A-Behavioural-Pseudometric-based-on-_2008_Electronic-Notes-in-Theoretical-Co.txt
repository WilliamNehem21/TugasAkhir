An alternate approach is grounded in the use of distance functions applied to processes (or states). For example, Giacalone et al. and Desharnais et al. [3,4] have introduced pseudometric definitions for the states of probabilistic transition systems. Within the context of labeled transition systems (LTS), Van Breugel outlines three different approaches to defining behavioral pseudometrics, which quantify the distance between states and serve as a quantitative equivalent of bisimilarity. In the realm of quantitative transition systems (QTS), De Alfaro et al. establish a distance function between traces and extend this trace distance to encompass distances between states. Additionally, they introduce the concept of branching distance, which offers a broader interpretation of bisimilarity.
