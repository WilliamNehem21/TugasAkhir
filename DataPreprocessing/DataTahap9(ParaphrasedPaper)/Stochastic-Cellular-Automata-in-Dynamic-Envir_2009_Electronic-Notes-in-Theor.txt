The structural performance of large concrete bridges generally deteriorates over time, potentially leading to them being deemed unusable in accordance with regulations. Environmental stressors are a significant factor in diminishing performance during both the design and operational phases. Environmental loading introduces uncertainties, which can be categorized as data-based or knowledge-based. While it may not always be possible to reduce data-based uncertainty, various models can be employed to evaluate available data, thus reducing knowledge-based uncertainty.

This study focuses on the unconventional numerical representation of processes relevant to assessing environmental exposure using a cellular automata (CA) technique with stochastic modifications. Numerical models were developed based on available data and supplemented with heuristic estimation for a deteriorating bridge project in South Tyrol. Samples were collected from the bridge prior to its dismantling for further chemical analysis to determine the spatial properties of the concrete, particularly the chloride concentration at various depths.

Concrete typically protects embedded steel from corrosion, but this protective environment is compromised when the chloride concentration reaches a critical level. Explicitly quantifying environmental stressors, such as de-icing salts, is essential for tasks like performance-based design and predicting the service life of reinforced concrete structures.

To simulate natural heterogeneity and stochastic effects in the real world, several modifications of the updating mechanism were introduced in the CA simulation. Visualizing the simulation state over time provides a comparison of concentration patterns for different methods. The identification of areas with potential steel reinforcement corrosion, known as the critical concentration region, is crucial for informing decision-making.

Throughout their life cycle, constructions experience numerous events that significantly impact their structural health. This work uses an existing bridge to illustrate diffusion-based cellular automata simulation. Seasonal de-icing salt application may be a critical factor in certain areas, considering that diffusion also occurs within the concrete structure independently of external chloride feed.

Maintaining the safety of concrete bridges as they gradually degrade due to traffic and environmental factors during their service life is a costly and challenging task. Chloride ion ingress is a crucial consideration for durability design and maintenance, particularly in regions where winter salt application for traffic safety is common, such as highways.

This case study utilizes the proposed CA approach to analyze potential chloride-induced deterioration using a real highway bridge as an example. Although the presented numerical simulation is conceptual, future applications may enable engineers to focus on modeling or predicting reinforcement corrosion in vulnerable locations, aiding in decision-making for design and maintenance planning.

The proposed stochastic modifications of cellular automata can model randomness in physics, exhibiting both stochastic noise and irregular trends without explicitly defining irregularities. This methodology brings the concept of CA closer to the diffusion processes observed in reality, potentially useful for estimating service life based on time to initiation of reinforcement corrosion caused by chloride ions.
