The importance of considering the effects of fading on the performance of ad hoc routing protocols has been often overlooked in prior studies. Many proposed routing protocols have used simplistic assumptions and unrealistic propagation models that do not take fading into account. This paper aims to compare the performance of two ad hoc routing protocols under the influence of mobility and fading. A comparative analysis is conducted using non-fading models such as free space and two-ray ground, as well as fading models including shadowing, Rayleigh fading, and Rician fading. Results from simulations demonstrate that fading models significantly degrade network performance under two mobility scenarios.

In wireless ad hoc networks, the performance of routing protocols relies on radio wave propagation, which is fundamentally limited by phenomena such as reflection and scattering. In addition to the distance between sender and receiver, factors like antenna position, transmission power, and building attenuation also contribute to signal strength fading. Probabilistic propagation models, such as shadowing, Rayleigh, and Rician, can greatly impact the performance of mobile wireless ad hoc networks. This study aims to investigate the effects of mobility and different propagation models on the performance of on-demand routing protocols, with a focus on packet delivery ratio, delay, and routing overhead. The findings suggest that the use of fading propagation models significantly alters simulation results.

The study involved simulations performed on the Windows operating system using Cygwin. Fading models were not initially integrated into the NS-2 simulator, so modifications were made by incorporating different fading models using C++ code to the wireless physical layer specifications. Mobility and communication scenario files were created, and TCL (Tool Command Language) scripts were written to set up the wireless simulation component. After compiling and running the scripts, trace files were generated to record traffic and node movement. Post-processing involved parsing these files using AWK to extract information necessary for evaluating performance metrics.
