The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces the nonlinear model of Kalman filtering. Section 3 presents a new and enhanced version of the truncated unscented Kalman filter, detailing the underlying principles and specific procedural steps of the algorithm. Section 4 covers the experimental setup and analysis.

The proposed algorithm utilizes the method of linear regression for the nonlinear filtering process in a way that enables it to handle non-bijective measurements. This extension of the filter's applicability is demonstrated through simulations, which reveal that the improved truncated unscented Kalman filter generally outperforms both the unscented Kalman filter and the quadratic Kalman filter.
