Section 2.3 of the paper discusses the relationship between coalgebras and various functors. It states that coalgebras for the covariant power set functor can be interpreted as Kripke frames, also known as non-deterministic transition systems. Some variations allow for the addition of labels to transitions or states. Similarly, coalgebras for the finite multiset functor correspond to directed graphs with n-weighted edges, commonly referred to as multigraphs. Additionally, coalgebras for the finite distribution functor are represented by finitely branching discrete time Markov chains. In modal logic, qq-coalgebras are recognized as neighborhood frames.

The translations mentioned in the paper depend on specific conditions concerning the type functor "t" and the propositional logic being Boolean. Therefore, the paper consistently assumes that the logic is based on BA. If the intention is to extend the results to DL, it is suggested that the notion of predicate lifting be modified by working with endofunctors "t" over the category of ordered sets and substituting the functor "q" with the down-set functor. However, the paper does not delve further into this matter.

Remark 6.10 emphasizes the significance of identifying a monotone set of predicate liftings in coalgebraic modal logic, as it enables the inclusion of fixpoint operators. The previous proposition addresses this issue in the case of weak-pullback preserving functors. Nonetheless, the paper mentions that the general problem for non-weak pullback preserving functors is still unresolved.
