This paper examines the model checking of the RLC protocol in the UMTS system, a third-generation mobile communication system. The EASN model checker is introduced, which allows the formal specification of behavior through a language based on Promela for control structures and ASN.1 for data models. The paper discusses the verification problem for RLC and presents the results of using EASN for verification, comparing it with Spin, which serves as the foundation for EASN.

While model checking has proven to be effective in program verification, it faces challenges with the state explosion problem when dealing with real-world programs such as telecommunication protocols. To address this issue, various measures have been implemented to enhance the efficiency of model checkers. Spin is highlighted as a verification system that incorporates techniques such as deadlock detection, verifying assertions, and specifying linear temporal logic properties for model checking.

The paper also addresses the limitation of input languages, such as Promela, in model checkers due to their restricted set of data structuring constructs, and suggests that incorporating ASN.1 data modeling capabilities into a model checker could be beneficial for the standardization process of telecommunication protocols.

The article is structured into sections, with a brief description of Spin and EASN tools in section 2, followed by a description of the RLC protocol in section 3. Section 4 explains how the protocol and its user environment are modeled and discusses the verification results, concluding in section 5.

The RLC protocol, part of the UMTS system, provides various data transfer services, including RLC connection establishment and release, dynamic QoS adjustment, and error notification. The paper focuses on verifying the reliable data transfer service in acknowledged mode, outlining the assumptions made in the model.

In addition, the paper discusses the relationship between RLC and other layers in the UMTS stack, as well as the use of an oracle for control communication between RRC layers to simplify the model. It also considers the capabilities of Promela and EASN to dynamically create processes and handle channel identifiers.

The paper conveys the alterations made in the EASN system to improve memory performance, particularly in the encoding and management of the state vector. Anomalies in the Spin system related to the RLC model are also addressed, such as issues with compression mask restoration during the search.

By exploring the discrepancies between Spin and EASN when working with the RLC model, the paper contributes to understanding the underlying causes of any discrepancies, indicating potential areas for improvement in the model checking process.
