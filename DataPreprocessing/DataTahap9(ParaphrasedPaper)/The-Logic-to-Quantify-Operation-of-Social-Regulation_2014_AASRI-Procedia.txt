Shifting the regulatory focus to social regulation areas is crucial for enhancing regulatory efficiency. It is important to assess the costs and benefits associated with regulation in order to determine the necessity of regulation and to select the most effective regulatory tools. Robert W. Hahn's 2006 report highlights the significance of cost-benefit analysis for government regulation. However, accurately evaluating the social costs and benefits of regulation is challenging. Social regulation should not only consider the comparison of costs and benefits, but also take into account factors such as social justice and sustainable economic development. Therefore, while cost-benefit analysis serves as a valuable assessment standard for regulators, it is not the sole determining factor in developing and implementing regulatory policies.

Accurately estimating coal reserves is essential for ensuring a reasonable sale price of state-owned mineral deposits, which is crucial for preventing state property loss. Furthermore, China lacks statistics on the water pollution caused by underground water and coal cinder produced during coal extraction. Developing appropriate types and amounts of taxes for regulating these externalities is challenging due to the difficulty in estimating the extent of damage caused.

Property protection relies not only on private force, but also on collective strength and national power. In our country, the protection of property rights is relatively limited, and consumer interests have been repeatedly compromised despite the existence of consumer protection laws.

Social regulation comes with a price, which includes both tangible and intangible costs, such as opportunity costs. Opportunity cost refers to the value of the best alternative forgone when a decision is made. Rather than aiming for minimum or maximum outcomes, it is essential to strike a balance that reflects the reward of accepting regulation without excessive indulgence. Economic actors should receive compensation and additional rewards for complying with regulation, and these rewards should be derived from a range rather than a fixed numeric point. In cases where rejecting regulations would yield greater profits than complying with them, legal sanctions and penalties should be imposed to ensure compliance.

The information environment plays a crucial role in regulation, as transaction costs can be reduced through open information. However, the complexity of reality poses challenges in achieving comprehensive media information regulation. The use of case law can complement media regulation, as demonstrated by the U.S. Times v. Sullivan rules, although it is not without flaws. For instance, concerns have been raised that this rule might encourage irresponsible behavior by the media.
