The leading means of communication, mobile networks provided by providers, have become widely utilized. In an effort to advance in this area, we propose and create a GPS-based mobile service locator system to assist people from all walks of life in finding addresses and locating their desired services via their mobile devices. Significantly, the proposed system can calculate the proximity distances between the user and the locations of the desired service. It is adaptable and can easily integrate additional mobile service providers and new services. A key distinction from existing systems is that it relies on GPS rather than mobile-based service providers, allowing for more accurate location determination.

Location-based services for network devices, particularly WAP-enabled phones, currently hold a prominent position in the market. Research in the field of location-based systems has been ongoing for over a decade. The pager system represents one of the earliest applications to provide the traditional method for locating personnel. To locate someone, a signal is sent from a central facility to a specific receiver unit (beeper), generating an audible signal and potentially displaying a number for the recipient to call back. Some systems enable the transmission of a vocal message to the callback number, and the recipient can use the conventional telephone system to confirm the signal and provide an appropriate response.

Earlier systems, such as the active location badge system, employed infrared technology to offer products in the domain of outdoor location tracking, utilizing GSM and GPS technologies. Such location-based services are confined to mobile phones. There are also several commercially available products, including Webraska, IntelliWhere, Openwave, and ESRI, which are recognized as georeferenced mobile phone applications.

However, the calculated distance presented to the user is not a physical one, as it is GPS-based, and does not account for the actual traffic conditions in the area. Nevertheless, it provides valuable information to the user.
