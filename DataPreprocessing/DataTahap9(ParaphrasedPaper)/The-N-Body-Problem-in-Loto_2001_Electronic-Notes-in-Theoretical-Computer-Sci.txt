The upcoming descriptions of several variants incorporate standard methods, such as Lagrangian mechanics for the n-body problem and Maxwell-Boltzmann theory for gas motion. Although these methods are commonly utilized in their respective fields, they are treated as distinct theories in physics. However, LOTOS advocates for a unified approach to all of these variations.

This inclusive approach spans across diverse fields, including aviation, computer-integrated manufacturing, embedded systems, graphics standards, hardware, medical devices, neural networks, and visualization (additional references are available). As far as the author is aware, the n-body problem is significantly different from any previous application of LOTOS. The only related work is the generation of graphical animations, such as the dining philosophers scenario.

Section 2 outlines the problem framework, demonstrating how the original n-body problem can be viewed more generally. Numerous variations are exemplified, followed by an explanation of the LOTOS specification framework that encompasses these variants. Section 3 discusses tool support for simulation, while Section 4 sheds light on the variations of the general problem. These variations are illustrated in Sections 5 and 6 for the n-body and Brownian motion problems.

The system is considered closed, meaning it is free from external influences. In LOTOS terms, all communication between bodies is internal, as the ether gate is concealed. In most applications, the bodies act deterministically in accordance with their attributes and the states of other bodies. However, certain applications allow for non-deterministic behavior.

For the majority of problem variants, the number of bodies is predetermined. However, the LOTOS formulation permits bodies to become inactive or to be re-activated as the system evolves, thus ensuring generality. This feature is pertinent to the space game, where spaceships may fire missiles, thus creating new bodies.

A state is essentially a record-like structure containing the specified attributes, and an operation to update a state is defined. "Nostate" is introduced as the undefined state, and the reference to "any params" includes any specification parameters generated for the problem variant. The behavior specified by the overall process involves the synchronization of the bodies with the step control process. All bodies broadcast their state via the ether gate, and each body can also communicate individually with step control via the control gate.

Initially, a body claims a unique identifier by synchronizing with the step control process. Bodies are typically initialized with no knowledge of other body states, but if a body is dynamically created during simulation, it is supplied with this information. In such cases, the body immediately enters its updating phase, "bodyupdate"; otherwise, it enters its waiting phase, "bodywait."

When waiting, a body may learn the state of other bodies via broadcasts over the ether gate. An inactive body may be activated by broadcasting its new state, with a check for a matching identifier in the new state. In the updating phase, the body may broadcast its own state and return to waiting. It may also learn the state of another body while its state broadcast is pending.

The "stepupdate" process accepts the broadcast of an updated body state, invoking "draw state" to record this. If the new body kind is "none" (due to inactivity), the count of active bodies is decreased. Ordinarily, the number of active bodies remains the same, and "stepupdate" increments the count of bodies it has observed. If more body updates are expected, "stepupdate" continues its behavior. Once all updates have been received, the behavior reverts to the main "step" process.

The specification parameters mainly control the simulation, with predefined values that can be redefined if necessary. These parameters include "limit" (number of simulation steps), "mode" (drawing mode), "pause" (time between animation frames), "scale" (drawing scale), and "tick" (simulation time step). Other specification parameters exclusively control how bodies are drawn (e.g., the diameter of a planetary body or particle). Parameters controlling the specification itself may also be defined, such as the impulse delivered to a particle in Brownian motion. These parameters, along with other numerical constants, are accumulated in "any params" for inclusion in the final specification.

Section 2 provides an overview of the overall strategy for simulating the n-body problem and its variants. Subsequent sections give informal explanations for how the specification framework is instantiated in each case, while Sections 5 and 6 delve into details about the n-body and Brownian motion applications.

The n-body problem entails a single kind of body: the mass. Masses are initialized with values for their mass, diameter, position, and velocity. To update the state of a mass, its distance to each other mass is calculated, along with the gravitational constant. The resulting force vectors for all masses are summed and divided by the mass m, yielding the instantaneous acceleration due to gravitational attraction. The simulation time-step uses the acceleration to determine the new position and velocity of the masses, which often exhibit surprisingly complex movements.

The orrery simulation is an emulation of the solar system, essentially a configuration of the n-body problem with specific values for the inner planets as bodies, and potentially for all celestial bodies. These bodies are initialized with their respective mass, diameter, distance from the sun, and orbital velocity. The drawing labels are generated based on the body kinds.

The space game, inspired by an early computer game, resembles the n-body problem but introduces strategic changes in the velocity and heading of each spaceship to simulate user control. This model is closed, and control is simulated by the gravitational attraction of the stars. Each spaceship may also randomly launch a missile, which is given a fixed velocity relative to the spaceship's heading. If a collision occurs, the simulation stops and the remaining spaceship is declared the winner, unless it collides with the other spaceship.

The state update process for air traffic simulation involves each aircraft adjusting its velocity incrementally towards its next waypoint, subject to a maximum speed. Once the final waypoint is reached, the aircraft is removed from the simulation. Aircraft also check their positions relative to each other, and a simple rule is applied if they approach too closely. In such a scenario, the upper aircraft climbs to avoid potential conflicts and collisions.

A mark is depicted as a stationary body, while a yacht's drawing is based on its length, position, and heading. The position of its sail is automatically determined by its heading relative to the wind. In isolation, a yacht aims to complete a course under varying wind conditions, and its strategy depends on the relative bearings of the wind and the next mark.

The complete set of ISAF rules is complex, but the simulation specifies only the most basic rules for yacht interactions. For instance, a yacht adjusts its behavior when approaching another body defined by ISAF rules. If the two bodies are in close proximity, specific priority rules and conditions are applied to the yacht, determining its course of action to avoid potential conflicts.

The description uses macros in m4 to instantiate a random number of particle bodies with specified parameters. The given particle diameter and random position are defined using macros, and their expansion is implemented in the simulation.

In conclusion, the n-body problem can be generalized to encompass a diverse range of applications, some of which are variations on the original problem, while others represent more radical interpretations. Through the development of a comprehensive LOTOS simulation and specification framework, it becomes possible to represent and simulate these diverse examples. This framework is populated with the specifics of the types of bodies, their initial setups, and how interactions update their states. A pre-processor processes this information to create a specific instance of the n-body problem specification, after which standard LOTOS tools simulate the system behavior, aided by C annotations. Each step of the simulation is graphically animated by a drawing tool, either on-screen or in an animated GIF file.
