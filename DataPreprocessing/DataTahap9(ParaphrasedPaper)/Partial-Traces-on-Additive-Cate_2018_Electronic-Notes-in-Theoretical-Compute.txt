Every abelian category C possesses a largest partial trace, which is obtained by restricting the canonical total trace on the category consisting of objects in C and relations between them. It is also demonstrated that the largest partial trace serves as a natural extension of the kernel-image trace on C (Theorems 4.5 and 4.6).

The study of (partial) trace is motivated by its significance in categorical semantics for recursive computation and GoI. The focus on partial traces in additive categories and abelian categories arises from the utilization of C*-algebra in GoI. However, the results presented are solely responses to technical queries on additive categories and abelian categories, without any immediate practical application to these research areas. Exploring the practical implications of these findings is a potential future direction.

The paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, the concepts of partially traced symmetric monoidal category, additive category, and abelian category are revisited, along with examples and fundamental properties of these categories. Section 3 provides examples of partial traces on additive categories, demonstrating that the partial trace derived by Haghverdi and Scott is the largest partial trace among those satisfying strong naturality. In Section 4, it is proven that every abelian category has a largest partial trace, and in the case of a semisimple abelian category, the largest partial trace coincides with the kernel-image trace. For the proofs of certain statements, refer to the corresponding section.

A pivotal concept in this paper is the partial trace on a regular category. In a regular category C, relations between objects can be considered, leading to the definition of a category Rel(C) comprising the objects in C and the relations between them. It is well-known that Rel(C) possesses the structure of a totally traced symmetric monoidal category. Consequently, a partial trace on C can be defined by pulling back the total trace on Rel(C). The construction of this partial trace is elaborated below, preceded by a restatement of the definition of a regular category.

It is important to note that the total trace in Rel(C) can be derived from the compact closed structure of Rel(Set), and this holds true for any regular category. The total trace trz on Rel(C) is derived from a compact closed structure of Rel(C) and is referred to as the canonical trace in. This relationship between compact closed categories and total traces is discussed in further detail in [9, 14]. It can be verified, albeit laboriously, that trz is a total trace on Rel(C).

The category Ab of abelian groups and homomorphisms is an additive category. Similarly, when R is a ring, the category ModR of left R-modules and homomorphisms also forms an additive category. Notably, the category VectK of vector spaces over a field K and linear maps is also an additive category. The subcategory of VectK consisting of finite dimensional vector spaces is denoted by FdVectK, which is itself an additive category.
