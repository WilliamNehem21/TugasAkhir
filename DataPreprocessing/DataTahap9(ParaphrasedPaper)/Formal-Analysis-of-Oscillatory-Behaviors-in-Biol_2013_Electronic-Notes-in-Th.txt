Cells comprise intricate, dynamic systems featuring complex networks of interactions involving proteins, genes, and small regulatory molecules. These components work in concert in a programmed manner to carry out various functions within an organism. Genes, as the informative units of DNA, decode instructions into proteins. When a gene is activated, information flows from the genetic to proteomic level through the intricate processes of transcription and translation. Some proteins are responsible for regulating gene expression by either activating or deactivating them. This interplay between genes and protein regulatory elements forms a biological regulatory network (BRN), often characterized by feedback loops aimed at maintaining optimal protein concentrations within a cell. The complex nature of these networks makes it challenging to predict their behaviors. Understanding cellular dynamics is crucial in comprehending the inherent morphological changes that occur during the progression of a disease. For instance, in the case of the p53-mdm2 feedback loop, oscillatory behavior is considered a significant factor in cancer initiation and progression.

BRNs are commonly represented symbolically by biologists as directed graphs or logical feedback circuits. The behavior of these interactive graphs and circuits is then examined to deduce the system's dynamics. However, as the number of interconnected biological entities grows, this modeling approach becomes limited in its ability to facilitate the understanding of network dynamics thoroughly.

Recently, BRNs have been characterized as concurrent systems, opening the door to the use of formal verification techniques in the field of systems biology. Bernot et al. have applied formal methods to the realm of systems biology, including the formal representation of BRNs as asynchronous systems of interacting biological entities in the BDD-based functional model checker SMV and the specification of biological properties in computational tree logic (CTL). Finally, they applied their approach to a case study involving the analysis of mucus production in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
