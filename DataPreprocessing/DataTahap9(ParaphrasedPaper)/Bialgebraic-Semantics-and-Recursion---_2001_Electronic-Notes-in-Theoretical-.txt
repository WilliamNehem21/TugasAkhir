Bisimulation can be represented using spans of coalgebra maps, as initially demonstrated in [citation]. However, by developing a general theory for locally ordered categories (specifically cppo-enriched ones), a more comprehensive framework can be established. In this context, simulations (or ordered bisimulations) can be defined as spans of lax and oplax coalgebra maps, which encompass partial bisimulations (also known as prebisimulations). Furthermore, a new version of the general theory can be formulated, albeit with the caveat that the weak preservation condition does not hold, despite the existence of insertors and preserved weak insertors.

Regarding potential future directions, one promising avenue for further research is to integrate recursion and value-passing, as exemplified in previous works [cite specific example]. Additionally, there is a pressing need to expand the scope beyond the current focus on gsos, particularly in addressing the challenges posed by probabilistic computation and its reliance on continuous domain theory.
