This academic paper demonstrates the security of quantum key distribution (QKD) against various attacks using a formal model called classical knowledge for quantum systems. The framework treats security as a logical property and employs meta-logic reasoning on the finite state machine corresponding to the QKD protocol. While prior studies have examined security issues related to QKD, the paper introduces an original logical-based approach to addressing these concerns.

Existing definitions of security for specific protocols are often overly specific, making it challenging to systematically analyze different protocols and their properties, especially when combined. Additionally, these definitions may not fully capture the practical realities of protocol implementation. In contrast, formal methods offer well-defined protocol languages that enable systematic presentation of protocols and their properties, as well as tool support for automated proof techniques. These tools are particularly beneficial for analyzing distributed protocols, such as cryptography, where manual proofs are prone to errors and are labor-intensive.

Despite the quantum community's belief that the security analysis of QKD has been resolved, formal analysis remains crucial because theoretical proofs of QKD security do not guarantee practical security. Hardware-related issues, which can create vulnerabilities and potential backdoors, are not accounted for in theoretical proofs. Formal methods are more adaptable to these scenarios, allowing for consideration of a range of different situations.

Recent research into formal methods for distributed quantum computation has led to the development of formal languages for protocol specification, including those based on classical process calculi and dynamic logic. Some of these frameworks have integrated logical tools for protocol analysis, with a particular focus on meta-logic reasoning to assert correctness properties on a non-logical base language. The use of knowledge for quantum distributed systems, defined independently of a protocol specification language, predates these developments.

Before incorporating modal operators for knowledge and time, it is necessary to define the propositions that these operators will act upon. The paper abstractly outlines these propositions and specifies the standard rules for combining them with logical connectives, providing examples of the types of properties of interest.

The paper proceeds to prove the security of QKD against various attack scenarios within the logical framework of knowledge and time. It emphasizes the originality of its logical-based approach in addressing these security issues. The paper begins by demonstrating that eavesdroppers monitoring classical communication channels cannot determine the key, a fundamental property that underscores the value of QKD as an alternative to classical private symmetric secret key establishment protocols.
