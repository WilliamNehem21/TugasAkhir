This paper presents an approach to integrating user and system models within a unified mathematical framework, aiming to provide a comprehensive understanding of human-system interaction. It outlines the fundamental concepts of this approach through a case study, reviews the progress made in this area, and discusses potential future directions.

The work on syndetic modeling originated from the Amodeus II project, a collaborative effort involving researchers from various disciplines such as computer science and cognitive psychology, with the objective of developing methods for designing and analyzing interactive systems. The project focused on integrating the results of human-computer interaction (HCI) modeling. The syndetic modeling approach combines computer system modeling and cognitive modeling within a common framework, incorporating a specific system modeling approach (interactors) and a particular approach to describing human cognition (ICS â€“ Interacting Cognitive Subsystems). The choice of these elements was influenced by the context in which syndetic modeling was developed and the potential for their integration. The paper also discusses the selection of a mathematical framework, highlighting the potential for alternative formal notations such as LOTOS and the interval temporal logic MEXITL for describing aspects of ICS.

The paper emphasizes the formulation of ICS principles as an axiomatic model, enabling the expression of user cognitive resources within the same framework as the behavior of computer-based interfaces for direct integration. The use of the interactor framework to model devices and interfaces allows for the representation of cognitive aspects within the same structure. The paper also discusses the potential use of different formal notations and representations for modeling ICS, highlighting the flexibility in the choice of a specific technique. It also describes the model of ICS, focusing on transformation processes and mental representations as key resources.

Furthermore, the paper explores the capability of the system to handle deictic input and its potential relevance to human-computer interaction, as well as issues related to image records and memory operations within the overall system. It also discusses sophisticated models of audition and auditory scene analysis, drawing parallels between these models and those used in the broader context of signal processing. Additionally, the paper touches on the implications of group usage of computer systems and the potential need to consider the behavior of groups of users, as opposed to individual users, within the syndetic modeling framework.

In conclusion, the paper provides an overview of the principles and progress of syndetic modeling, highlighting future research directions and open questions in this field.
