Ontologies play a vital role in facilitating access to diverse databases containing relevant information across various domains. To handle heterogeneity and differing semantics, structured texts and descriptions are used in a hierarchical concept definition. This study specifically focuses on life sciences (LS) related ontologies, encompassing elements from molecular biology, bioinformatics, physics, chemistry, medicine, and related fields. The paper discusses the utilization of various tools and applications including AGBase, GOChase, GOPubMed, and other open biomedical ontologies (OBO) such as the Cell Ontology and Uberon.

The paper also provides an overview of different ontology editors such as AMIGO, NEON Toolkit, OBO-Edit, VocBench, and Fluent Editor. Furthermore, it discusses the emergence of graphical tools for ontology manipulation, such as OWLDoc, and the development of the OWL ontology browser and editor named Swoop by the American University of Maryland. The article also introduces the Ontology Renderer plugin and the Annotea framework, highlighting their roles in ontology interpretation and management.

Regarding future research directions, the paper suggests the automation of ontology creation and emphasizes the importance of evolution and mapping of existing ontologies. It recognizes the significance of developing ontologies that are cost-effective, abstract, and reusable for specific applications within the LS experimentation domain.
