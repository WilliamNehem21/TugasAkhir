This paper presents a preliminary method for validating software against eventuality properties in a synchronous context, using an automated functional testing tool that employs statistical predictions. The study focuses on testing methods for eventuality properties and presents results from a telephone feature validation benchmark for detecting feature interactions.

The paper is organized into several sections. Section 2 provides the context for the case study, while Section 3 outlines the principle of the approach to testing against eventuality properties. Section 4 discusses the testing tool, Lutess, and its adaptation for testing against eventuality properties. Section 5 briefly presents the results of the case study, and Section 6 concludes the paper.

The paper also discusses the limitations of functional black-box testing approaches for evaluating the truth value of temporal properties in programs. It highlights the need for considering realistic behaviors in complex environments, as well as the potential use of statistical input data generation and selection for testing against eventuality properties.

Furthermore, the paper discusses the potential use of classical distribution laws or a combination of such laws for determining the elapsed time distribution of certain properties. It suggests using a confidence index as a stopping criterion for testing against eventuality properties. Lastly, the paper references a previous work that utilized Esterel and formal methods to enhance confidence in the functional validation of a commercial DSP.

The paper also includes details on the events emitted by a telephone system and the system's possible outputs, highlighting the input-output behavior of the system.
