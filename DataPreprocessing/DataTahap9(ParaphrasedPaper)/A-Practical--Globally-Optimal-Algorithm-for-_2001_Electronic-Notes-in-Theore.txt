The recognition by alignment method involves iteratively selecting a small set of model features and matching them with a set of image features to determine a geometric transformation. The size of these sets is determined by the minimal number of feature correspondences needed to uniquely determine a transformation. However, the transformation computed from these correspondences may not necessarily maximize the overall number of feature correspondences due to location errors in the data. As a result, recognition by alignment is an approximation or heuristic for optimal geometric matching.

Hough transforms can be seen as performing pose clustering using simple binning methods in transformation space. While they are easy to implement and fast, they do not accurately model location error and are susceptible to false positives and false negatives due to not enforcing the constraint that a single model feature maps to a single image feature.

The algorithm takes two types of inputs: a data-independent component which computes the transformation and evaluates the match quality, and a data-dependent component which provides the actual coordinates of model and image features.

To understand the performance and complexity of the algorithm, it is necessary to consider the geometry of the transformation space. While this paper does not provide a complete complexity analysis, it offers a description of the underlying geometry and some insight into its implications for complexity. The computational complexity of the algorithm is not formally analyzed here, but practical demonstrations of its performance in experiments are provided. An informal average case analysis of a related problem suggests that the computational complexity of the algorithm is comparable to that of alignment methods.
