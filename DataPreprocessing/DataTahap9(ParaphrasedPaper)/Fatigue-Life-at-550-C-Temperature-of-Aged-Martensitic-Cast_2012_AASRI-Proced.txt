Cyclic softening was observed in the tested cast steel throughout the entire fatigue test, leading to the assumption that deformation of the hysteresis loop in the compression half cycle served as the criterion for concluding the test at each of the five strain levels. This cyclic softening demonstrates the exhaustion of fatigue life in the examined cast steel. This phenomenon has also been observed in high-chromium martensitic steels used in the power industry, with similarities in the stabilization of hysteresis loop parameters noted in the literature. A similar trend was observed in high-temperature creep-resistant martensitic steels of the p91 and p92 type in their as-received condition, with the transition point occurring after approximately 1000 cycles. Furthermore, it can be concluded that the shift of the transition point to a smaller number of cycles in the cast steel after aging, compared to the as-received condition, signifies a deterioration in the plastic properties of the gp91 cast steel.
