The pork industry in China plays a crucial role in global meat production, with about 700 million pigs slaughtered annually, accounting for around 50% of the world's total production. Traditional methods for measuring pig body temperature involve manual procedures, including the use of thermometers and stress-reducing techniques to ensure accurate measurements. Infrared imaging technology has also been explored for detecting angiogenesis of malignant tumors, with potential applications in breast cancer prognosis. Additionally, infrared cameras have been used to measure the temperature of pregnant sows and to evaluate the health status of piglets. The adoption of infrared technology in the livestock and poultry breeding industry has led to advancements in image processing methods, but challenges such as imaging noise and low contrast may hinder its widespread application.

As the agricultural industry continues to advance towards digitalization and automation through the Internet of Things (IoT), the non-contact, real-time, and long-distance capabilities of infrared temperature measurement align well with the concept of IoT agriculture. Integration of infrared technology with other information management and farming technologies has the potential to create more efficient farming models and breeding processes, presenting promising prospects for the future development of the industry.
