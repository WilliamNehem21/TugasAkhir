Even a well-designed distributed system may face challenges, particularly in critical software and sensitive applications like internet protocols and global electronic banking systems. Software engineers are interested in assessing software properties, ranging from fundamental conditions like deadlock to more complex ones, to ensure system integrity.

The field of multi-agent systems, which involves autonomous entities engaging in social activities, also encounters similar issues. Since multi-agent systems exhibit a broader range of behaviors compared to traditional distributed systems, verifying system properties is equally crucial in this context.

Software validation, which involves ensuring that software meets specific requirements, currently employs three main approaches: testing, theorem proving, and model checking. These techniques involve scrutinizing program inputs and outputs, using formal logic to represent programs, and evaluating temporal models to verify properties.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 establishes the notation for the semantics of deontic interpreted systems, Section 3 introduces the language of CTLKD, an extension of CTLK for representing agent behaviors, Section 4 presents a bounded semantics definition for satisfaction, which is utilized in Section 5 to define the bounded model checking algorithm, and Section 6 applies the formalism to a multi-agent systems scenario involving a fault in an agent's operation.

In this section, the paper applies the machinery of bounded model checking to verify a scenario in which an agent deviates from its expected behavior. The scenario involves a faulty agent, specifically examining the possibility that the agent may send acknowledgments without receiving the bit. The analysis is conducted using deontic interpreted systems. The paper also encodes the local states in binary form to employ them in the model checking technique.

The formalism is applied to an example involving the bit transmission problem with faults, focusing on a scenario where one agent fails to operate as intended, specifically considering the possibility that a particular agent, denoted as "r," may send acknowledgments without having received the bit. The paper conducts an analysis using deontic interpreted systems and proceeds to apply model checking to this example.

The paper also discusses the transition system induced by the informal description of the scenario, along with the local states and protocols defined, and provides further details for consideration.

Additionally, the paper outlines encoding the local states in binary form to facilitate the use of the model checking technique and discusses properties of the scenario for application in the model checking process.

Overall, the paper highlights the advantages of using bounded model checking, particularly in scenarios where only a portion of the model needs to be generated. It also discusses checking the validity of specific formulas, such as those related to verifying properties in the model. For the purposes of the paper, it focuses on checking the validity of formula (iii) in particular, along with considering the negated form of the formula.
