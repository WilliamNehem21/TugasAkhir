Mesembryanthemum crystallinum, a member of the Aizoaceae family, is a highly resilient halophyte that can withstand extreme stressors such as salinity, drought, and high temperatures. It exhibits a complex network of hormonal and transcriptional responses in reaction to these stressors, resulting in the induction or repression of gene expression, including the transition from C3 photosynthesis to crassulacean acid metabolism. The plant progresses through five distinct growth phases during its life cycle: germinating seedlings, juvenile, adult, flowering and fruiting, and seed formation.

The study area experiences lower relative humidity in the summer compared to the winter (65% and 81%, respectively), and evaporation rates are higher in the summer than in the winter (7.8 mm and 2.8 mm per day, respectively). The primary habitats within the study area include salt marshes, sand formations, reed swamps, and non-cultivated fertile land. The salt marshes span the entire coast and are connected to the natural lakes Idku, Burullus, and Manzala. The sand formations comprise sand dunes and sand flats, while the swamps are found in depressions where water accumulates through seepage from nearby lakes and cultivated land. The non-cultivated fertile land in the southern part of the area has slightly higher soil salinity than the cultivated land.

Soil samples were collected from each habitat, and various analyses including soil texture, water holding capacity, soil porosity, organic carbon, and sulfate content were conducted. Additionally, the soil solution from each sample was examined for electrical conductivity, pH, and chloride content. The study also measured different growth parameters of M. crystallinum within three permanent stands representing the sand dune, sand flat, and salt marsh habitats.

Vegetation classification and ordination techniques were utilized to analyze the data and examine the relationships between floristic composition and environmental variables. The findings revealed that the distribution of M. crystallinum was influenced by factors such as calcium carbonate, pH, electrical conductivity, and sodium ion concentration.

The study observed that the fresh weights of M. crystallinum increased gradually during the early growth period, peaked at 14 weeks, and then decreased significantly during the flowering stage. The root growth was found to be highest in the sand flat habitats, while it was inhibited in the salt marsh habitats due to salinity. The plant's growth parameters exhibited a progressive decrease from juvenile to seed production stages. Additionally, the study suggested that the plant's survival in salt marsh habitats is likely supported by the synthesis of osmolytes and antioxidant molecules, enabling it to thrive despite salt stress.

In conclusion, the habitats of M. crystallinum are facing threats from human and other biotic interferences, particularly the establishment of new villages. The study recommends establishing a protectorate along the Mediterranean coast of Egypt to safeguard these habitats, extending from Ashtum El Gamil Protectorate to Burullus Protectorate in the northern region of Egypt.
