In the domain of manufacturing biotechnology drug products, the viral safety control strategy plays a pivotal role as a critical framework for pharmaceutical quality management, comprising three essential elements: prevention, testing, and clearance. The prevention component entails thorough screening to detect any adventitious virus contamination in raw materials, reagents, and endogenous/adventitious virus contamination in cell banks. The testing strategy focuses on critical process intermediates, such as the end of production cell (EOPC), limit of in vitro cell age (LIVCA), and unprocessed bulk (UPB). The clearance strategy typically involves demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of the manufacturing process in inactivating or removing endogenous/adventitious viruses through viral clearance (VC) validations.

The accuracy and dependability of validation experiment results hinge on ensuring the representativeness of the samples through careful selection, control, and comprehensive analysis, which is often overlooked. The representativeness of the sample is greatly influenced by two key factors: the physicochemical characteristics of the active drug substance, including the isoelectric point, glycosylation profile, and major impurity composition; and the characteristics of process intermediates, such as the concentration of the target protein, the buffer matrix, and the total titer of retrovirus-like particles (RVLPs). Process intermediate characterization studies may be sufficient to ensure representativeness for processes with high robustness, such as low-pH incubation and nanofiltration. However, for processes with high inherent variability, such as chromatography, comprehensive comparability analyses of both factors should be conducted.

Factors such as protein concentration, pH, and conductivity of the sample, loading sample, and elution buffer need to be analyzed for various chromatography processes based on the worst-case conditions. Furthermore, in processes such as nanofiltration, considerations include factors like pressure limits for virus filters from different suppliers and the possible impact of process interruption or pause in the experimental design. For chromatography, the precise assessment of the relative residence time under different working modes is crucial and is primarily dependent on the column height and sample flow rate.

ICH Q5A (R1) has offered comprehensive guidance for selecting model viruses based on both process characteristics and virus property considerations. With an increasing number of sponsors changing the host cell substrate for commercial reasons, the potential risks of endogenous and exogenous viruses in host cells need to be considered. For example, for SF-9 cells, it is advisable to use baculovirus as a model virus, while for CHO cells, murine leukemia virus should be added.
