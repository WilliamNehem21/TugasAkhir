This study explores the significance of textual and unstructured data in evaluating the credit risk of sovereigns. The paper introduces a novel approach to comprehend and forecast sovereign ratings, utilizing information from the annual country reports issued by the European Commission. The model utilizes a neural network-based document embedding technique known as document to vector (doc2vec) to convert each country report into a numerical vector, which is then used as features in a logistic regression model. The model, trained using data from 2011 to 2019, accurately predicts 70.27% of country ratings in the test sample, showing a slight improvement over the results obtained using only macroeconomic variables.


In recent decades, concerns about the quality and understanding of ratings have stimulated research interest. It is considered important to comprehend the determinants of ratings for assigning scores to nonrated countries. The paper compares the proposed model with traditional approaches such as ordinary least squares regression or ordinal response models, which typically rely on macroeconomic variables to explain credit ratings.


The proposed model employs a shallow neural network to convert words in the reports into a multidimensional space vector, allowing the entire country reports to be vectorized. Subsequently, these vectors are used as input in a logistic regression to predict country ratings.


The paper discusses previous research on credit rating models, outlines the embedding approach for dealing with textual data, details the data and key findings from the proposed model, and compares the proposed model with other models using macroeconomic and textual information. It also outlines the process for training the proposed model, discusses the development of a new model based solely on macroeconomic variables, and presents the results obtained from combining macroeconomic variables with information extracted from country reports.


The study selects 14 macroeconomic variables, including consumer prices, GDP, international reserves, foreign direct investment, terms of trade, budget balance, public debt, GDP per capita, and six governance indicators, which are then used in the models for the period spanning from 2011 to 2019.


The proposed model demonstrates better predictive accuracy when compared to a model based solely on macroeconomic variables. It also presents interesting results highlighting the potential of incorporating unstructured textual data and opinions provided by the European Commission within the country reports.


The final model, which combines macroeconomic variables with the vectors obtained from the doc2vec model, does not result in a significant improvement in predictive accuracy. This outcome is attributed to the country reports already encompassing all the information contained in the macroeconomic variables, thus not providing substantial additional value. The study concludes by underscoring the importance of qualitative information in determining credit ratings and the potential of natural language processing in credit risk mitigation. It also suggests avenues for future research to explore the impact of different embedding models on model accuracy and the use of pre-trained models for predicting ratings.
