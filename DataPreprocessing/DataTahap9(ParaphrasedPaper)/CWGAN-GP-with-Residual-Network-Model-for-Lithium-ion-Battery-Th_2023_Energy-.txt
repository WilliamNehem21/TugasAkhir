In 2021, the cumulative installed capacity of pumped storage energy was less than 80% for the first time, with an annual growth rate of 15%. Meanwhile, lithium-ion batteries maintained their dominant position in the energy storage market, with an annual growth rate exceeding 85% and a 3.5% increase in cumulative installed capacity compared to the previous year. The advancement of lithium-ion battery technology is crucial for reshaping our energy landscape, and artificial intelligence (AI) is playing a key role in optimizing the efficiency and safety of these batteries through data processing, model building, and predictive analysis.

One significant area of focus in lithium-ion battery research is the development of thermal management systems due to the crucial impact of temperature on battery performance. A novel approach using a synthetic thermal convolutional-memory network (STCMN) that combines long and short-term memory networks (LSTM) with temporal convolution networks (TCN) has been introduced for lithium-ion battery behavior diagnosis amidst noise interruptions. Finite element simulations, as well as field experiments, have been conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of infrared thermal imaging in estimating thermal power and providing a non-invasive method for assessing lithium-ion battery thermal behavior.

In the realm of image generation, various methods such as variational autoencoders (VAE), deep belief networks (DBN), and generative adversarial networks (GAN) are being explored. GAN, in particular, has gained widespread application in generative modeling due to its robust sample learning capabilities.

Another area of study involves the utilization of Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) to enhance lithium-ion battery fault detection. This approach demonstrates notable improvements in model performance, particularly in fault detection accuracy and overall metrics, signaling its potential for practical applications.

Although progress has been made in using GAN to augment faulty samples for thermal imaging of lithium-ion batteries, there remains a disparity between the quality of generated images and real ones. Future efforts will concentrate on enhancing the quality of generated thermal fault images by refining network architecture and acquiring genuine thermal images of faulty lithium-ion batteries to validate the effectiveness of this approach in real-world scenarios.
