Wireless sensor networks are faced with the pressing challenge of energy efficiency due to their reliance on battery power, which ultimately leads to the eventual depletion of energy and device failure. Addressing this issue requires the development of data dissemination techniques that are energy efficient in order to prolong the lifespan of sensor devices. One approach to achieving this is through the implementation of clustering and tree-based data aggregation for sensor networks, which has been shown to enhance the network lifetime of wireless sensor networks. To this end, a proposed protocol utilizing a hybrid approach of ant colony optimization (ACO) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) for energy efficient clustering and tree-based routing is presented. This protocol involves the formation of clusters based on remaining energy, followed by the use of hybrid ACO-PSO for data aggregation to further improve inter-cluster data aggregation. Extensive analysis has indicated that the proposed protocol significantly enhances network lifetime when compared to other techniques.

Simulated annealing has been utilized to optimize the network coverage and lifetime of wireless sensor networks as objective functions. Nayak and Vathasavai employed type-2 fuzzy logic within WSNs to effectively determine the efficiency of cluster heads. Ouchitachen et al. implemented the improved multiobjective weighted clustering algorithm (IMOWCA) for the selection of cluster heads, using residual energy to choose the best performing node for communication with the base station. Elshrkawey et al. addressed issues with the LEACH protocol, such as improper selection of cluster heads, formation of unbalanced clusters, and continuous transmission of updating data, by using threshold values for the election of cluster heads, implementing modified TDMA scheduling to break the steady-state phase, and having sensor nodes send updated data at their designated times. Rani et al. utilized the E-CBCCP protocol to cache data at cluster heads and relay nodes in order to avoid redundant data transmission, with control packets employed to notify sensor nodes not to transmit the same data packets. Laouid et al. developed a route selection approach based on hop count and residual energy of each sensor node to maximize the network's lifespan.
