Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is characterized by a high incidence of viral persistence and progression to chronic hepatitis. The purpose of this case control study was to investigate the expression of apoptosis-related proteins Fas (CD95) and Bcl-2 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with chronic HCV and schistosomiasis, and to assess their role in the development and maintenance of these diseases. Fas and Bcl-2 expression in PBMCs was analyzed using flow cytometry in 85 subjects, including 40 patients with chronic HCV, 25 with schistosomiasis, and 20 healthy controls. The study found that increased apoptotic levels correlated with elevated Fas expression on the surface of PBMCs, whereas there was no significant difference in Bcl-2 expression. The expression of Fas was significantly higher in patients with HCV compared to those with schistosomiasis and healthy controls, while there was no significant difference in Bcl-2 expression between the three groups. It was concluded that the detection of apoptosis in PBMCs from patients with chronic HCV was associated with increased expression of apoptotic markers.

HCV is a major cause of chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide. The virus exists as an evolving quasispecies, which plays a crucial role in the selection of escape mutants. Additionally, several viral proteins interfere with cellular functions, particularly those involved in the host's immune response. Several HCV proteins also modulate cells through interaction with different effectors involved in cell proliferation, apoptosis, or the interferon-signaling pathway. Accumulating evidence suggests that apoptosis of hepatocytes and PBMCs plays a significant role in HCV infection.

The research methodology involved the use of flow cytometry to analyze the expression of apoptosis-related proteins in PBMCs. The study was conducted in compliance with ethical guidelines and all participants provided informed consent.

The results of the study indicated an association between increased apoptosis of peripheral blood T cells and heightened surface expression of Fas in patients with chronic hepatitis C. It was also found that HCV infection of PBMCs might induce Fas expression and induce apoptosis in these cells, which may contribute to the observed decrease in the number of PBMCs in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Furthermore, increased apoptosis of immune cells during HCV infection via the Fas signaling pathway may facilitate viral persistence. On the other hand, another study demonstrated that the increased susceptibility of PBMCs in patients with chronic hepatitis C to apoptosis was associated with reduced intracellular expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2.

In summary, the study findings suggest that the expression of apoptotic markers in PBMCs may serve as an indicator of disease progression and severity in patients with chronic HCV. Modulation of apoptotic processes, particularly the activation of the Fas surface receptor, may offer potential therapeutic interventions for chronic HCV patients.
