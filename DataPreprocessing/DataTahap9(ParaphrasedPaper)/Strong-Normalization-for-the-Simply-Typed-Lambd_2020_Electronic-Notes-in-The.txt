The paper discusses the formalization of strong normalization for the system of assignment of simple types to terms in constructive type theory, specifically focusing on a slick proof of strong normalization presented by Joachimski and Matthes. The proof utilizes complete induction on types and subordinate induction on a characterization of strongly normalizing terms established via one-step beta reduction. The entire formal development has been verified using the Agda system, and the paper assesses the strengths and weaknesses of this approach.

The approach presented in the paper focuses on formally proving strong normalization for the system of assignment of simple types to terms. The chosen method of proof is based on the work of Joachimski and Matthes, wherein they provide slick proofs of weak and strong normalization through simple induction on the type system. The main lemma in these proofs enables handling the challenging case of applications in the induction by employing complete induction on types and subordinate induction on a characterization of strongly normalizing terms.

The paper also presents two definitions of strongly normalizing terms, with the first definition (predicate sn) being introduced as the accessible part of one-step beta reduction, and the second definition being an alternative syntactic characterization. The subsequent sections of the paper aim to establish the soundness of the second definition with respect to the original one and present a completion of the strong normalization proof by demonstrating that all terms typable in the system of simple types assignment satisfy the second definition.

Furthermore, the paper discusses achieving soundness of one definition with respect to the other and outlines the process of proving that typable terms are strongly normalizing through a simple induction on the given type system. It also addresses the explicit handling of alpha-conversion in the formulation of main definitions and results, as well as the presentation of additional lemmas to validate closure under alpha conversion. The authors believe that their method brings them closer to a presentation in a textbook style without hiding formalization-related details. However, they acknowledge the challenge presented by explicitly handling alpha-conversion, particularly in the formulation of definitions and results.
