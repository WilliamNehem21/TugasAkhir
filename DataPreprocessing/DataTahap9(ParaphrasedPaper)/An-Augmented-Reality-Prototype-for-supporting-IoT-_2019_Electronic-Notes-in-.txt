Simultaneously, there is a growing interest in incorporating sustainability awareness and energy-related aspects into the science curriculum within the educational sector. It is widely recognized that raising awareness among young people and influencing their habits related to energy consumption is crucial for fostering sustainable energy behavior. The European Union (EU) views environmental education as a significant tool for shaping human behavior towards sustainability, and educational buildings constitute a substantial portion of non-residential building stock in the EU. Therefore, the educational community has the potential to have a substantial impact on reducing energy consumption, provided that sustainability principles and responsible consumption behaviors are effectively taught. It is also important to note that behavioral changes, in many cases, can result in energy savings comparable to those achieved through more direct approaches, such as using energy-efficient devices.

In line with this, a primary objective of energy efficiency initiatives in schools is to make students aware that energy consumption is influenced by individual behaviors. In this context, we believe that IoT technologies can support such initiatives by providing immediate feedback on the impact of individual actions and by automating the implementation of energy-saving policies. The availability of real-time measurements of environmental parameters, such as energy consumption, luminosity, temperature, and noise, can facilitate various education-related applications and scenarios. For example, teachers can utilize collected data and analytics during classes to explain basic phenomena related to the monitored parameters. The Horizon2020 EC-funded project "Green Awareness in Action (GAIA)" is developing an IoT platform that combines sensing, web-based tools, and gamification elements to increase awareness about energy consumption and sustainability in school buildings, with the aim of promoting behavior change towards energy efficiency.

In this study, we explore the rationale for using augmented reality to complement an in-class lab activity for the GAIA project. This activity utilizes IoT devices and real-time data from sensors to help students gain a deeper understanding of concepts related to energy consumption and efficiency within their school building. The augmented reality component provides a visual accompaniment to these activities and also simplifies access to sensor data in classrooms, thereby aiding in device maintenance.

In the context of energy efficiency and sustainability, there are numerous research projects and activities focusing on energy-efficient buildings. However, our work emphasizes energy awareness through the lens of behavioral change towards more sustainable practices in school buildings. While there have been past projects that have produced material related to sustainability and STEM education tied to the Internet of Things, few have attempted to integrate real-world IoT data with a curriculum aiming for long-term behavioral change, as in the case of GAIA.

Our work presents an overview of the GAIA educational lab kit and its activities, as well as insights into the cloud-based component of the GAIA software ecosystem. We used Google Earth to visualize sensor data inside a 3D building representation in a similar approach to the work presented here, with the aim of promoting sustainability awareness and helping students understand energy consumption within buildings in a STEM context.

It is important to note that the functionality presented in this work represents a prototype version of the envisioned system. As such, the implementation is in a preliminary stage, and future revisions of the system will entail a richer set of functionality tested over longer time periods and in real-world educational settings.

In addition, we are considering further enhancements to the 3D visualization, such as the manipulation of the current visualization by moving objects or changing the visualization mode. The application can communicate with both the GAIA cloud services and the Raspberry Pi devices used for the lab kit activities, thus allowing for direct manipulation of sensor values and control over visualization capabilities of the IoT device. However, since this is the first iteration of the software, we anticipate making numerous changes and additions to provide a more usable and useful system.

Overall, the main focus of our work is to explore the potential of combining real-world IoT data with augmented reality in an educational setting.
