The widespread adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) can be attributed to the advancements in internet and computer technology. This technology offers a wide range of services that were previously unavailable to modern society. IoT involves the interconnectedness of objects through the internet, providing users with diverse services. While existing detection schemes like vecure or cusum are effective in identifying individual attacks, they struggle to detect complex attacks. The inability to detect these complex attacks can lead to delays in the arrival times of autonomous vehicles at their intended destinations, as these attacks can cause vehicles to create and act upon incorrect driving plans.

A new security scheme has been proposed to address the vulnerabilities of the IoT. This scheme focuses on using trajectory information to detect complex attacks that cannot be identified by existing security systems. By reducing network overhead and collecting real-time traffic information, the scheme aims to improve security in the IoT. However, managing a large amount of security knowledge poses a challenge, and as this knowledge accumulates, the detection time for attacks may be delayed. To address these issues, future research will explore a temporal logic, rule-based security system that is applicable to the IoT. Additionally, efforts will be made to further develop the scheme to effectively detect and respond to attacks in the IoT environment.
