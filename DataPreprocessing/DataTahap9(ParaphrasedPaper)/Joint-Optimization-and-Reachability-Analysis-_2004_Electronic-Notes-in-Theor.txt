In this section, we demonstrate the application of graph transformation systems with time to model optimization problems. To exemplify this approach, we provide a modified version of a job-shop scheduling problem known as the personalization machine example. This example serves as a simplified representation of a case study conducted within the ametist project.

Matching a specific pattern with another graph involves utilizing a time attribute, which is a logical clock with non-negative integer values typically attached to nodes. This time attribute plays a key role in defining the progression of time in discrete steps in a consistent manner within graph transformation with time.

Within the guard, we verify the presence of nodes and edges with corresponding types (e.g. convcell[cc1] and mycell[p1][cc1]), as well as attribute conditions (e.g. personalized[c1]== true). The state variable updates involve the removal of the pers hold edge and the creation of a new conv hold edge, along with adjustments to the time variable based on the conditions specified within graph transformation systems with time.
