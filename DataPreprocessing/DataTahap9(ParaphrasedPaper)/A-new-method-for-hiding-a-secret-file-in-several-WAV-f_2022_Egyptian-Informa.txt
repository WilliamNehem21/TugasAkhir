Concealing information is crucial for safeguarding sensitive data, particularly when transmitted through digital communication channels. Information hiding, unlike encryption techniques, operates by embedding data within other digital media to avoid detection by prying eyes and hackers. As concealment methods advance, so do techniques for extracting hidden data, necessitating the combination of encryption and hiding approaches for enhanced efficiency. For example, a technique has been proposed to distribute secret data across multiple wav files in a random manner, utilizing a circular secret key agreed upon between the sender and receiver, thus ensuring high durability and making it difficult to detect hidden content within any specific wav file. Embedding information in audio files, known as steganography, conceals digital data in audio files such as wav, mp3, and wma formats without altering the original audio content, making it virtually imperceptible to eavesdroppers and less likely to arouse suspicion.

The primary objective of information hiding in audio files is to seamlessly integrate valuable secret information without causing any perceptible changes to the audio file. Methods of concealing data in sound files, such as least significant bit (LSB), echo, and spread spectrum hiding, leverage the properties of the human auditory system to ensure imperceptibility. Since sound files, like image files, can be modified to contain hidden information without noticeable alterations, it is essential to consider the human auditory system's ability to detect disturbances and random noise added to a sound file.

Due to their widespread use, audio files are well-suited for conveying hidden information. Therefore, researchers have explored various techniques for exploiting audio signals and properties to conceal information, including least significant bit, echo hiding, hiding in silence intervals, phase coding, amplitude coding, spread spectrum, and discrete wave transform.

The proposed method is designed for use with 16-bit uncompressed digital audio files, such as wav files. Each sample in a 16-bit wav file consists of two bytes representing the sample's amplitude. The technique hides secret data using the two least significant bits in each of these audio samples, resulting in a hiding capacity of two bits out of 16 bits, or 12.5% of the total size of the carrier audio file.
