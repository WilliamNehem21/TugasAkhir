Different theories in physics are motivated by various factors and are expressed using different mathematical formulations. Quantum mechanics, for instance, utilizes Hilbert space, while another theory has recently gained attention for using subsets of specific sets to represent states and relations between these sets to represent the operations of the theory. Other quantum-like theories employ different mathematical formalisms. It would be advantageous to have a unified mathematical framework to compare these theories, as it would enable pinpointing differences and associating them with the varying physical features of the theories.

This paper aims to introduce such a unified framework developed in previous works and use it to analyze key examples, with a focus on the property of non-locality. The framework is extended to encompass an abstract definition of the GHZ state and a corresponding concept of correlations. The framework not only applies to quantum mechanics using Hilbert space but also to other physical theories. This generalization of physical theories was initially proposed by Abramsky and others and further developed by several researchers. Physicists interested in understanding symmetric monoidal categories are referred to specific resources for introductions and tutorials.

The paper discusses stabilizer states, which are represented by Clifford unitaries forming a group. It is noted that all n-qubit Clifford operations can be simulated using the CNOT gate and single-qubit Clifford unitaries, with the latter forming a group isomorphic to the permutation group S4. The only allowed measurements in the theory are projective Pauli measurements.

The definitions of "stab" and "spek" are presented in terms of concrete vector spaces, linear maps, sets, and relations, allowing for a clear connection to the original formulations of the theories. However, from a categorical perspective, the internal structure of category objects is irrelevant, with only the algebra of morphism composition being important. Various results are derived from this definition, including implications about the states and observables of the object q.

Additionally, it is observed that "muqts" have restrictions on observables and states but still allow considerable freedom to define properties for compound systems. Different "muqts" can vary greatly in their other morphisms on q, and "stab" and "spek" are not the only types of muqts. The paper also discusses applicability of the abstract terminology and concludes that the proof utilizes a basis structure and four unbiased states. An analogous argument could be constructed in any dagger symmetric monoidal category with certain features and scalar types. Finally, it is noted that any muqt will have an analog of the proof, with the scalars representing the GHZ correlations.
