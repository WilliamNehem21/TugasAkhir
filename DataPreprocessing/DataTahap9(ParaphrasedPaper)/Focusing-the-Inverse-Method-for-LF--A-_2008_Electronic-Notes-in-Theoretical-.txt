The primary focus of this paper is the development of a forward inverse method prover for the logical framework Twelf, which facilitates the specification of deductive systems using axioms and inference rules. Twelf is based on the logical framework LF, a dependently typed lambda-calculus. The paper discusses the definition of LF types and the implementation of subtyping relations, as well as the generation of new facts through forward chaining using two different loop structures. It also presents results on the number of rules generated and explores the possibility of extending the implementation to hereditary harrop formulas and the full higher-order fragment. Challenges related to efficient higher-order unification, bounding the inverse method search, and incorporating goal-directed search into the method are also discussed.

The authors intend to extend the implementation of the inverse method to cover hereditary harrop formulas and the full higher-order fragment in the future. However, they acknowledge that doing so will require addressing several challenges, including efficient higher-order unification, bounding the inverse method search, and incorporating goal-directed search. The paper also discusses the possibility of incorporating ideas from previous work on left focusing, uniform proofs, and right focusing to improve performance. Additionally, it explores the potential to incorporate magic sets, a logic programming technique, to reduce the number of generated intermediate goals and enhance the competitiveness of the inverse method compared to backward chaining logic programming.
