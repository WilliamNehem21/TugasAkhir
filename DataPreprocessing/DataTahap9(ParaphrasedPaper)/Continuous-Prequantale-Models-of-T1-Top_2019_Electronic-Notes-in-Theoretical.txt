Dana Scott developed the domain theory to establish a mathematical basis for denotational semantics in programming languages. This theory has played a significant role in advancing the study of topological spaces, benefiting from the tools provided by topology. There is a strong interconnection between the topological theory of spaces and the order theory of partially ordered sets. Many scholars are particularly interested in the use of domain theory to address topological problems by embedding classical topological spaces into the set of maximal points of appropriate partially ordered sets.

A poset space x refers to a partially ordered set P such that the space of maximal points (max(P)) is homeomorphic to x. Several studies have presented conditions necessary or sufficient for topological spaces to have a poset model. For further information on poset models, readers are encouraged to consult references [8, 9, 10, 11].
