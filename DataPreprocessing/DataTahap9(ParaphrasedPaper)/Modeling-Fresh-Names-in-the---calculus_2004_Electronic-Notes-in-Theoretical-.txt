The syntactic level poses a challenge regarding the association of names and their scope, while the operational semantic level requires the fulfillment of freshness conditions for names. At the model-theoretic level, the emphasis is on establishing a final semantics through coalgebra. Moreover, a finite representation of finitary processes is preferred from a practical standpoint. As for the second paragraph, it states that the parameter k serves as an upper limit for the domain of reindexing functions between all descendants of p and q. As m(k, k) is finite, there is a limited number of potential relations to be indexed bisimulations. Consequently, an algorithm can be devised to determine the bisimilarity of finitary processes.
