The significance of the food supply chain became particularly evident following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. Lockdowns and government-imposed restrictions caused intermittent disruptions in food supply chains globally. For example, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported a significant number of COVID-19 cases and deaths among workers in meat processing facilities across 19 states. Similar incidents were reported in other countries, leading to import bans and trade disruptions.

Despite the impact of scholarly publications and their influence on scientific quality, a global bibliometric analysis focusing on the future of food safety using traceability-based solutions had not been conducted previously. This article explores the application of traceability solutions in food safety using various technological applications, aiming to provide a comprehensive overview of recent developments in food safety and traceability. The study utilized the Scopus database to conduct a bibliometric analysis, examining the distribution and trends of publications over time, the origin of publications, organizations and authors contributing to the field, as well as collaborative relationships between countries.

To visualize the data, the study employed software such as VOSviewer, which allows for the creation of maps representing co-authorship, keyword co-occurrence, citation, and bibliographic coupling based on bibliographic data. Additionally, bibliometric analysis was conducted using the bibliometrix R-package, which provides tools for quantitative research in the field of bibliometrics and scientometrics.

The results of the study showed an increasing trend in publications dating back to 2014, with a significant number of publications and collaborations originating from countries such as China, the United States, and European Union countries. Furthermore, the analysis revealed that organizations publishing in this area were primarily from China, Singapore, and New Zealand, with the highest level of collaboration observed between the USA and China.

Although the results shed light on the current state of research in the field, it is important to note that the study's reliance on the Scopus database may lead to variations in results over time due to the continuous growth and emergence of new technologies in this area. Therefore, future studies may benefit from combining different databases to provide a more comprehensive depiction of the research landscape. Nonetheless, the results of this study can serve as a foundation for further investigation and identification of research gaps in the field.
