The concept of big data involves a diverse range of hardware and software technologies with heterogeneous infrastructure. The Hadoop framework is essential for the storage and processing of big data, offering a fast and cost-effective solution across various sectors such as healthcare, insurance, and social media. While Hadoop's distributed computing model and flexibility are advantageous, they also give rise to vulnerabilities that can pose threats to data security. This paper discusses different types of vulnerabilities in Hadoop and provides possible solutions to mitigate these vulnerabilities. The study includes an experiment setup to simulate common attacks and analyze the impact on performance, highlighting the importance of implementing a defense-in-depth approach for data protection.

The paper emphasizes the significance of leveraging big data intelligently for informed decision-making, as well as the need to effectively store and analyze the massive amount of data generated from various sources. It discusses the fault-tolerant storage system of Hadoop's distributed file system and the parallel processing capabilities of the MapReduce framework.

Furthermore, the paper discusses the complexities of security and privacy in the context of big data, focusing on vulnerabilities in the infrastructure, data privacy, and data management. It also explores various encryption mechanisms and monitoring techniques for securing sensitive information in the Hadoop environment.

In addition to addressing security vulnerabilities, the paper delves into the types of cyber threats that can affect Hadoop, including impersonation attacks, denial of service (DoS) attacks, and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. It also underscores the need for continuous monitoring, vulnerability scanning, and patch management to detect and address potential security weaknesses before they are exploited.

The study underscores the limitations of traditional enterprise security products in addressing the unique security challenges posed by big data and emphasizes the need for tailored security solutions and comprehensive training to enhance the resilience of security infrastructure against evolving threats.
