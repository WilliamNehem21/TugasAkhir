Lately, entanglement has gained significant importance and has become necessary in various contexts such as quantum algorithms, quantum communication protocols, and quantum cryptography, among others. Consequently, the identification of whether a given quantum state is separable or entangled has become critically important, referred to as the quantum separability problem (QSP). Essentially, this problem represents an example of a combinatorial optimization problem known as the weak membership problem.

It can be demonstrated that 'm' represents the mean and 'v' denotes the correlation matrix, thereby uniquely defining the Gaussian state. For the sake of simplicity, we will specifically focus on the scenario where 'm' is equal to 0, as 'm' can be readily eliminated through local displacement, and thus does not affect the separability or inseparability of the state.

However, it is worth noting that in multipartite systems, apart from separability or inseparability, there is also the potential for partial separability or partial inseparability. For example, a subsystem may be separable with respect to other subsystems that are entangled. Consequently, the QSP becomes more intricate, and even for Gaussian states, it is not fully comprehended.
