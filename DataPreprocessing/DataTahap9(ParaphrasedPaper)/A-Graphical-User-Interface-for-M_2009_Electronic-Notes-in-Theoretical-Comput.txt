This paper introduces a graphical user interface (GUI) for Maude-NPA, a cryptographic protocol analysis tool that incorporates algebraic properties of cryptosystems not supported by other tools. These properties include the cancellation of encryption and decryption, abelian groups (including exclusive or), and modular exponentiation. Maude-NPA is based on rewriting logic, unification and narrowing, and performs backward search from a final attack state to determine its reachability from an initial state.

The GUI animates the verification process of Maude-NPA, displaying the complete search tree and allowing users to visualize graphical representations of final and intermediate nodes of the search tree. Notably, the GUI has been developed using a declarative graphical interaction framework associated with Maude, including IOP, Imaude, and Jlambda, which facilitates interaction and interoperation between formal reasoning tools.

Rather than employing a standard approach to GUI development using a conventional programming language, the GUI design is based on a declarative, rewriting-based philosophy that treats GUI interactions as another form of rewriting. The graphical objects appearing in the interface are implemented using the interoperability platform (IOP), which supports the actor model, and its associated Imaude library, extending Maude to provide a framework for building various applications and graphical interfaces.

The paper also discusses formal verification approaches for cryptographic protocols, such as model checking and the bounded-session model, as well as other tools with graphical output interfaces, including Scyther and Span. The article concludes with sections on the implementation of the Maude-NPA GUI, its features, and plans for future work.
