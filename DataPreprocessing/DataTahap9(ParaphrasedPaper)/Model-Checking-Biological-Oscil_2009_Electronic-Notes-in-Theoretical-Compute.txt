Synchronization phenomena in large populations of interacting components are widely observed in nature and have been extensively studied in various fields, including physics, biology, chemistry, and social systems. In biology, examples of synchronization include networks of pacemaker cells in the heart, the nervous system, and groups of fireflies flashing in unison. Understanding synchronized collective behavior is crucial in systems biology, particularly for developing methods to control the dynamics of systems with desired properties. The distributed synchronization of biological systems is often modeled using the theory of coupled oscillators proposed by various authors such as Art Winfree, Charles S. Peskin, and Yoshiki Kuramoto. In this theory, each member of the population is represented as a phase oscillator operating independently at its own pace.

In this paper, we introduce Kuramoto Synchronization Logic (KSL) to specify properties of synchronization during the simulation of Kuramoto-based oscillators. Additionally, we propose a model checking algorithm for this logic and demonstrate its effectiveness by verifying certain properties using a prototype simulator and model checker that we have developed.

The structure of the paper is as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of related works and the Kuramoto model. Section 3 discusses timed automata, defines oscillator timed automata, and specifies the interaction semantics. Section 4 introduces the Kuramoto synchronization logic (KSL) and its model checking algorithm. Section 5 presents an example of analysis, and Section 6 concludes by outlining potential directions for future work.

Over the past few decades, several mathematical models have been developed to study spontaneous synchronization phenomena in populations of biological coupled oscillators. These models have been inspired by real biological systems, including the mutual synchronization of cardiac and circadian pacemaker cells, the rhythmic flashing of fireflies, and wave propagation in the heart, brain, intestine, and nervous system. The mutual synchronization in these systems can occur through episodic impulses or smooth interactions.

One approach involves the communication among a population of pulse-coupled oscillators through sudden pulse-like interactions, such as when a neuron fires. This was first studied by Peskin, who proposed a model for the mutual synchronization of sinusoidal node pacemaker cells. He worked with identical oscillators and conjectured that they would all eventually fire in unison under arbitrary conditions. While Peskin also conjectured that synchronization would occur even if the oscillators were not perfectly identical, this remains an open problem.

We employ timed automata with invariants on the states, also known as timed safety automata, which are commonly used in modeling and verification tools. These automata incorporate a strong notion of fairness due to the invariants, which is beneficial for defining oscillator timed automata and interaction semantics.

A transformation ensures that each oscillator timed automaton measures the time elapsed since the last occurrence of a specific event, and the remaining time until the next occurrence. This process is described in detail.

We further discuss the measures of each oscillator timed automata involved, the perturbations detected by the global observer, and observing the synchronization process using traces.

In future work, we plan to use hybrid automata instead of timed automata to model oscillators and define the interaction semantics, fully implement a model checker and simulator for KSL, and apply the model checking of the extended logic to control fibrillation in cardiac cell networks.
