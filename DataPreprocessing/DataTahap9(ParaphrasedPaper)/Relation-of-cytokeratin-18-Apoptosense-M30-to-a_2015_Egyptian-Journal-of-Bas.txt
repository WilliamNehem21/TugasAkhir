Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a progressive illness that can lead to chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Cytokeratin 18 (CK18) is a protein found in liver cells that undergoes enzymatic cleavage during liver damage. The M30 epitope of CK18 (CK18-M30) is implicated in various apoptotic pathways. This study aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of CK18-M30 as a non-invasive method for evaluating liver fibrosis and its correlation with the Metavir score. The serum concentrations of CK18-M30 were measured using an ELISA test in 168 patients with chronic hepatitis C. The results revealed a significant increase in serum CK18 levels in a stepwise manner from fibrosis stages A0 to A3 and from F0 to F4. There was a strong positive correlation between CK18 levels and fibrosis stages, liver transaminase levels, and viral load. The study concluded that elevated serum CK18-M30 levels, indicative of enhanced hepatocyte apoptosis, were significantly increased and correlated with the severity of liver fibrosis. It was also found that CK18 levels were elevated in patients with normal liver enzyme levels, indicating an association between apoptotic CK18 and liver damage. These findings are consistent with those of previous studies, and may have clinical implications for the management of chronic hepatitis C.
