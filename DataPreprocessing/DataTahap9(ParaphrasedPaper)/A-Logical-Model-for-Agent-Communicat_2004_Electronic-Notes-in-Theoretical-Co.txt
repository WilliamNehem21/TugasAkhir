The current proposals for ACL exhibit some limitations in defining their semantics. Our paper seeks to address these shortcomings by defining an ACL semantics as a specification of the analytical impacts of agent communicative acts. We analyze agent communication using concepts from speech act theory, departing from the prevailing view in artificial agent research by defining communicative acts in relation to changes at the social relationship level between agents. We consider commitment as a fundamental concept underlying the social dimension of multiagent systems and introduce a basic artificial institution aimed at providing agents with the means to influence the commitment network that binds them to each other.

Our analysis focuses on communicative acts, which are actions performed by agents to communicate with others, and we view them as institutional acts carried out through message exchanges, specifically focusing on events that agents are authorized to perform by the basic institution.

In our treatment, both commitments and precommitments are brought about through the performance of communicative acts. Agents bring about communicative events by exchanging messages, and these events can function as commitment manipulation actions, creating new or modifying existing commitments, thereby impacting the relationships between agents and their obligations toward each other. The core ontology of the basic institution allows for five fundamental operations for commitment manipulation: making or canceling commitments, making precommitments, canceling precommitments, and accepting precommitments. These actions are defined by axioms that describe their constitutive effects, which are the state of affairs that necessarily hold after the given action is performed.

We also establish the truth conditions of a CL sentence, determining the fulfillment, violation, or pending status of the relevant commitment, based on the truth value of its content. The correspondence between message exchange events and commitment manipulation actions is formally defined, specifying the effects of exchanging messages on the network of commitments binding the sender and the receiver.

We introduce the functor cancel(e, x, y, s) to represent the event types corresponding to message exchanges that cancel commitments or precommitments, and define the conventions for these actions. We stress that a cancel message exchange can represent different commitment manipulation actions, and we address potential ambiguities in such exchanges.

In our general definition of communicative acts, we refer to the conventions of the basic institution, which establish that exchanging a message of a given type counts as a specific institutional action, given certain conditions. These conditions are categorized as ontological presuppositions, defined by the core ontology, and authorizations, which relate to the institutionalized power of agents. We provide a general definition of institutional actions to formalize these points.

Moreover, we argue that all communicative acts can be achieved through the use of a single type of message, namely declaration messages, which corresponds to the performative execution of the communicative act. This practical insight allows for the definition of a full ACL starting from one single type of message, declaration messages, with other types of messages seen as useful abbreviations that do not increase the expressive power of the ACL.
