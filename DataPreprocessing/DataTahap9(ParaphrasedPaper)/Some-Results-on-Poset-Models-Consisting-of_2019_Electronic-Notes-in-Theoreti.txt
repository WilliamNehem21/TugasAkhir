In the context of a topological space X, the collection Q(X) comprising all nonempty saturated compact subsets of X forms a partially ordered set under the reverse inclusion order. The posets of the form Q(X) are significant in various aspects of domain theory. This study delves into additional properties of such posets, particularly their connections to the dcpo models of T1 topological spaces.

While it is a known fact that every sober space is well-filtered, it is worth noting that a well-filtered T1 space can exist without being sober. Furthermore, there are directed complete partial orders (dcpos) whose Scott spaces are well-filtered but non-sober (refer to [4, example 2.6.1]). Additionally, there are coherent well-filtered spaces that are non-sober.
