We want to emphasize that our current use of an indirect proof strategy is necessary because a direct proof of, for example, proposition 2.7, is not yet available. However, this indirect approach also provides valuable insight, as our representation of quasi-Nelson residuated lattices as twist-structures allows for the straightforward construction of concrete examples of such algebras. Additionally, it is important to note that while our focus in this paper is exclusively on algebras, readers with a logical inclination should recognize that we consider algebras as the algebraic equivalent of logics. This perspective is justified by our engagement with algebraizable logics, enabling the straightforward transfer of our results between algebra and logic.
