The research on Egypt's food security is a significant topic that has been the subject of extensive studies and debates. There exists a notable gap between domestic milk production and consumption in Egypt, leading to high import costs. The current literature predominantly focuses on analyzing short-term policies to aid policy makers in making strategic decisions. Our research aims to develop an Intelligent Recommender System (IRS) to produce more accurate estimates for evaluating long-term policies. Additionally, the IRS aims to assist policy makers in reducing future uncertainty and encourages domain experts to anticipate future impacts and evaluate proposed policies. This approach intends to provide a new level of situational awareness to enhance the decision-making process. Our IRS integrates various analysis methods such as trend impact analysis, RT-Delphi, knowledge-based, explanation, and mathematical forecasting models to facilitate participatory decision-making for long-term strategic planning.

The nature of long-term strategic planning is characterized by uncertainty and complexity, stemming from future unpredictable events or wildcards. In this context, two essential activities for policy makers are exploring future scenarios and formulating and evaluating policies. While explorative future scenarios raise awareness about potential wildcard impacts, policy formulation and evaluation aim to offer justifiable recommendations for future policies based on their anticipated impacts. Due to the high uncertainty and complexity of the future, long-term policy formulation and evaluation processes are inherently unstructured.

The Delphi method is a robust and well-structured tool for knowledge acquisition, particularly due to its anonymity process. By collecting controlled opinion feedback through a series of questionnaires, the Delphi method facilitates consensus building among domain participants. Furthermore, RT-Delphi, as an online tool, enhances the efficiency of knowledge acquisition from domain experts and establishes a large participatory and anonymous online system involving all relevant participants.

Expert knowledge and experiences are leveraged to identify significant future wildcards and their potential impacts that could alter the base forecast. The real-time (RT) Delphi method is frequently utilized for knowledge acquisition in this context. Additionally, domain ontology plays a crucial role in facilitating knowledge acquisition by minimizing misunderstandings during discussions and defining a common language among domain experts.

In our study, we seek to develop an IRS to generate more justifiable estimates for evaluating long-term policies and to support policy makers in reducing future uncertainty. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we provide a case study on the impact of external wildcards on milk production in Egypt. This support aims to enhance the decision-making process by providing a new level of situational awareness. Furthermore, we propose extending our work by integrating the proposed approach with interval-based/fuzzy-based TIA and utilizing data-mining techniques for automated ontology building.
