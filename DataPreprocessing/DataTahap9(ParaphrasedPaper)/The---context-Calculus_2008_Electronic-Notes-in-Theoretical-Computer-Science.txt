In the traditional convention, x, y, z, and w are unique variables with levels 1, 2, and 3, respectively. It's noteworthy that the proof of termination for σ smoothly extends when the rules for forming a set, σnew, are incorporated. The proof of confluence for the entire system also extends smoothly. We will illustrate the application of σ in examples shortly.

The lcc is characterized by simplicity, clarity, and favorable properties. It appears to strike a technical balance, as each extension we've examined leads to significant non-local changes. In the field of computer science, a key challenge often lies in achieving a beneficial equilibrium between simplicity and expressiveness, and the lcc may fulfill that role.
