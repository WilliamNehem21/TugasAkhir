A logical framework offers a higher level of generalization, as opposed to an intuitive and non-technical expression. For example, consider a logic L with formulas and structures, where these formulas undergo semantic evaluation. In addressing each modal logic for this purpose, two key issues arise. Firstly, it is necessary to determine if the modal language has adequate expressive power to describe the desired graph property. If not, a language with greater expressive power must be sought. If the initial language is sufficient, the complexity of using the logic's inference mechanisms to test whether a given graph has the Hamiltonian property using the identified formula needs to be evaluated computationally.

The basic graph logic's language lacks sufficient expressive power to describe the desired property. Consequently, a logic with a more expressive language is needed, while ideally remaining decidable in relation to the defined problems. Prior to formulating a description for Hamiltonian graphs, it is essential to address certain graph-theoretical issues. In graph theory, there is no known result providing a necessary and sufficient condition for a graph to be Hamiltonian. The discovery of a formula that describes these graphs without directly articulating the Hamiltonian cycle would essentially establish such a condition. As a result, the formulas inspect all paths in the graph in pursuit of a Hamiltonian cycle. Notably, a formula for a graph with n vertices employs n nominals.

The most straightforward attempt to describe the Hamiltonian property is through a formula representing pure brute force, which has a factorial length based on the graph's size, rendering it impossible to be frame-checked. Nonetheless, formula length is not the sole issue, as evidenced by the introduction of an alternative formula with polynomial length based on the graph's size.
