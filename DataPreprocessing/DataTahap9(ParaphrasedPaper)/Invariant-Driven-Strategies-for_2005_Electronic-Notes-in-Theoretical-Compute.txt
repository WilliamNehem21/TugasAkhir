This academic paper introduces generic strategies that aim to control system execution by ensuring the satisfaction of specified invariants. These strategies are characterized by their adaptability to the particular system being governed, the logic used to express the invariants, and the specifics of the invariants themselves. The authors exemplify the utilization of these strategies with a focus on invariants expressed in propositional logic, while also acknowledging the potential for extending their applicability to other logics. The paper argues that current methods for managing nonterminating and nonconfluent systems display shortcomings, and describes how the proposed strategies provide a more effective and maintainable alternative. The authors also emphasize the benefits of separating invariants from the system's code to enhance clarity and maintainability, and they demonstrate the potential for expressing invariants separately from the system code. The paper further discusses the practical implementation of the proposed strategies, utilizing the formalism of maude and demonstrating their efficacy in maintaining system integrity through a case study involving invariants expressed in propositional calculus. The authors envisage that this approach could contribute to advancements in system control, and they propose future research directions in this area.
