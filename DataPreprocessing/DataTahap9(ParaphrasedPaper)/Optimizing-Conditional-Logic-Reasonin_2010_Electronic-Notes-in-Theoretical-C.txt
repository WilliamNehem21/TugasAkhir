To demonstrate the importance of the suggested improvements, we created various categories of conditional formulas, each displaying a distinct overall structure that outlines its complexity in relation to different aspects of the algorithms. This allows us to highlight the specific strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm.

The experiments were carried out on a Linux PC with a dual-core AMD Opteron 2220S processor running at 2800MHz and 16GB of RAM. It is evident that implementing the proposed optimizations can lead to a substantial enhancement in performance. Generally, the performance of the proposed algorithms in the generic reasoning system Coloss is on par with specialized conditional logic provers like CondLean. However, making a direct comparison is currently challenging due to the lack of explicit listing of the benchmarking formulas used for evaluating CondLean.
