Computer science is currently in the midst of a major transformation, moving from the perspective of computer systems as standalone programs to considering them as dynamic multi-agent societies. As evidence of this shift, there has been a significant focus on designing and implementing languages and protocols for communication and interaction between software agents. However, despite these efforts, there is currently no formal mathematical theory of agent interaction languages and protocols. In this paper, we propose the first mathematical theory that addresses the semantics of agent interactions and incorporates category-theoretic entities for the utterances made in an agent dialog and the commitments incurred by those utterances, along with maps between them.

The predominant approach to designing agent interaction protocols has been influenced by dialog games from the field of argumentation philosophy, which have structural similarities to economic game theory and two-party games in model theory. These protocols have been developed for various types of dialogues, such as those involving information-seeking, mutual inquiry, persuasion, negotiation over resource allocation, and deliberations over actions in specific circumstances.

Efforts to define language and protocol semantics have largely focused on individual languages or limited classes of protocols, and there has been no comprehensive effort to define a semantics for all agent interaction protocols. This paper aims to fill this gap by presenting a categorical semantics for a broad class of protocols, explicitly defining protocols and abstracting away from specific protocol types and interaction outcomes.

Our framework is distinct from the work on game semantics for general computational processes, as it specifically pertains to interactions between purposeful agents in a multi-agent dialogue with the intention of achieving goals. The paper presents a comprehensive categorial semantics for all protocols that can be formally defined within a specific structure. The framework leverages category theory, portraying a category as a minimalist mathematical construct consisting of two sets and a combination rule system.

The paper also discusses the nature of commitments in the context of dialog games and emphasizes the importance of defining commitments in terms of future actions or propositions external to the dialogue. While the framework may not capture all agent interaction protocols, it is general enough to represent most types commonly observed in human or agent dialogues.

In addition to presenting the categorial semantics for agent interaction protocols, the paper provides examples to illustrate the expressive power of the framework and discusses future directions for research in this area.

One major example of a formal interaction protocol discussed in the paper is the auction process, which involves buyers negotiating the price of goods with sellers. The framework represents this auction process as a tiling, defining a single tile based on the number of atomic locutions and the set of allowable parameters for each.
