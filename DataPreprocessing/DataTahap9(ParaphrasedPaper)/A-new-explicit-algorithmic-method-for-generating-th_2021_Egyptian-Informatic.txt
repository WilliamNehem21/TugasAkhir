Number theory has a growing significance in the fields of computer science and cryptography. Prime numbers, a fundamental aspect of number theory, are natural numbers greater than 1 that have only 1 and themselves as divisors, while composite numbers are natural numbers greater than 1 that are not prime.

The subsequent sections of this paper are structured as follows: Section 2 presents the algorithm for generating prime numbers. Section 3 introduces a unified framework for deriving the sieves of Eratosthenes and Sundaram based on the proposed method. Finally, Section 4 provides a summary of the conclusions.
