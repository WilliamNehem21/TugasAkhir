This study focuses on the experimental setup for studying cavity flow in a low-turbulence wind tunnel. It involves measuring wall static pressure and sound pressure using microphones to investigate the oscillation characteristics of different types of cavities at low speeds. The research also explores the impact of geometric parameters such as length-to-depth ratio and width-to-depth ratio on the flow patterns and noise characteristics of the cavities. The findings indicate that, in incompressible flow conditions, the basic flow patterns of cavities are independent of flow velocity. Moreover, a length-to-depth ratio of 1 to 12 covers the entire range of flow patterns from open to closed, and an increase in this ratio results in greater cavity radiation. Additionally, an increase in aspect ratio leads to higher sound pressure energy within the cavity.

Cavity flow is a prominent issue in practical engineering and is an active research area in aerodynamics internationally. Complex unsteady cavity flows, like those found in aircraft landing gear, weapons bays, and car sunroofs, often exhibit flow oscillation and noise radiation when the flow passes over the cavity. The study of cavity flow involves intricate interactions between flow, sound, and vortices, as well as challenges related to unsteady behavior and shear layer instability. This research has significant implications for understanding and addressing these complex phenomena.
