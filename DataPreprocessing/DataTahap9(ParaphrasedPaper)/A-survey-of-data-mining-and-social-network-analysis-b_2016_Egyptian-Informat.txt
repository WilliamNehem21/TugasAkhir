The increasing popularity of online social networks (OSNs) has made social network analysis a prominent area of research. Researchers are particularly interested in analyzing the usage and detecting abnormal activities in OSNs, as these anomalies can have significant consequences. This paper provides a comprehensive review of techniques for detecting and preventing anomalies in social networks. It discusses different types of anomalies and their categorization based on various characteristics. Additionally, the paper reviews data mining approaches used to detect anomalies, with a special focus on social network-centric anomaly detection techniques that are behavior-based, structure-based, and spectral-based. The paper also outlines potential future research directions in this area.

Since the inception of online social networks such as Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook in 1997, these platforms have become integral to various domains including entertainment, education, business, and communication. Companies have leveraged social media for promoting their brands and products, leading to increased popularity and sales. However, the presence of anomalies in social network data poses significant challenges. For instance, malicious users may create false identities to engage in fraudulent activities, posing a threat to innocent users and causing potential losses. Consequently, there is a growing need to understand the reasons behind anomalous activities and develop strategies to prevent such behaviors. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of techniques used to identify and address anomalous behavior, including their application to multiple domains.

Anomalies in social networks can manifest in various forms, including behavior-based anomalies, static labeled anomalies, dynamic anomalies, and white crow anomalies. The paper also discusses hybrid anomalies, which are a combination of multiple anomaly types. Different anomaly detection methods are outlined, such as supervised approaches, density-based methods, and cluster-based techniques. The paper also highlights the use of advanced approaches, including self-training and co-training, to identify anomalies. Additionally, it provides insights into the challenges associated with existing anomaly detection methods and presents potential solutions.

The paper categorizes anomalies based on various parameters and provides in-depth discussions of different anomaly detection methods and algorithms. It also discusses the application of anomaly detection techniques to diverse domains and real-world applications, such as opinion spam detection, telecommunication networks, and cybercrime prevention. Furthermore, the paper presents a review of structural properties and link analysis in social networks, emphasizing their significance in anomaly detection. It also addresses the challenges associated with detecting anomalies in dynamic networks and presents recent developments in this field.

In conclusion, this paper provides a comprehensive review of anomaly detection in social networks, covering a wide range of anomaly types and detection techniques. It also identifies potential areas for future research in anomaly detection and emphasizes the importance of addressing anomalies in social network data.
