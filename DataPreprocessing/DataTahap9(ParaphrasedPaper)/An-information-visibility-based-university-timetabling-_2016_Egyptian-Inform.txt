Several studies have shown that teaching spaces in many academic institutions are only partially used, with rooms being unoccupied for half of the time, and when they are in use, they are often only half full. This inefficiency in space allocation is attributed to a lack of timely and accurate information about available spaces within universities, rather than insufficient resources. The increasing number of students enrolled in Egyptian public universities, along with their varying attendance patterns, has created a need for flexible space management based on demand. Underutilization and overutilization of spaces result from students' attendance patterns and transfers between faculties or departments. This paper proposes integrating genetic algorithms with RFID technology to improve space management in response to these challenges.

A study conducted at the University of North Carolina revealed that efficiently utilizing classrooms saves costs and is closely tied to budget and funding. The study involved frequent visits to university buildings to monitor space utilization and make adjustments as needed. This study did not employ technology to assist in monitoring space utilization rates or tie it to the timetabling process. Existing space planning practices are hindered by incomplete information about future events and enrollment patterns, as well as reliance on simple methods to measure space utilization.

Past research on space allocation mostly focused on computational time and did not consider monitoring and reevaluation of allocated spaces. Additionally, there have been studies showing that RFID technology can enhance resource management in job-shop scheduling and in university space utilization. However, data captured by RFID technology needs to be processed using analytical tools to provide solutions to timetabling and space allocation problems.

The concept of information visibility for better resource management in universities through RFID technology was later proposed, although reliance solely on RFID technology may not be sufficient. The study found that the UGA algorithm was able to save up to 41% of available rooms in the faculty, compared to only 19% using the old manual approach, and 29% of total working hours available weekly were saved.

After reallocating spaces, some events may remain underutilized or overutilized. In response, the paper suggests merging underutilized events in the same room if they share the same professor and course, with no other scheduled events at the same time. Similarly, for overutilized events, splitting groups into subgroups could improve the situation if coordinated with professors.

Overall, the paper proposes a novel approach using genetic algorithms and RFID technology to address the challenges of space management in universities. These findings highlight the need for more comprehensive and efficient methods for space allocation and utilization.
