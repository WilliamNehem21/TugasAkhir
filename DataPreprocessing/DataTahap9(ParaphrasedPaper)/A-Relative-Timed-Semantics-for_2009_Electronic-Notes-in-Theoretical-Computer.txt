The remaining sections of this paper are organized as follows. Section 2 provides an introduction to BPMN, while the introduction to CSP and Z, which are referenced in this paper, can be found in the appendix. Section 3 offers an overview of our syntactic description of BPMN, and Section 4 briefly describes our relative timed semantics. Section 5 presents properties that relate the timed and untimed models based on CSP refinements, and revisits an example to demonstrate the features of the relative-timed model. Each atomic task within the timed semantic model must take a positive amount of time to complete. A BPMN state describes a subprocess state.

Furthermore, the paper describes the implementation of the semantics discussed within it, which has been realized as a prototype tool using the functional programming language Haskell. The tool takes an XML serialized representation of a BPMN diagram from the JViews BPMN modeler, enriched with timing information as custom properties, and translates it into an ASCII file containing CSP processes representing its behaviors expressed in machine-readable CSP.

The results of the timed model are presented, where it is noted that a diagram is timed if it contains timing information and untimed otherwise. Additionally, it is established that every timed diagram is a timed variant of another untimed diagram, i.e., an untimed diagram augmented with timing information.

The paper also introduces the characteristic participant within the framework of time-compatible classes and collaborations, defined by a pair of name and environment, as described by the function "chart."

In comparison to the W3C standards, which define a six-dimensional space, it is noted that the definitions presented in this paper are more relevant to business process developers. Additionally, it is underscored that our semantic model has been designed in relation to our earlier untimed model to ensure that timed-independent behavioral properties are preserved across both models. This differs from existing BPMN standards, as they are not designed for analyses of collaborations where more than one diagram is under consideration.
