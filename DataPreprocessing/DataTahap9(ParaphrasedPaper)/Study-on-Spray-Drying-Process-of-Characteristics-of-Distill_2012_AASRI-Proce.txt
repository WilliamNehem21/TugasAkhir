In an effort to maximize the utilization of distillers' hops and preserve their original nutrients and characteristics, a study was conducted to investigate the impact of inlet temperature, outlet temperature, and sample concentration on the yield and rehydration rate of spray-dried distillers' hops. This research employed an orthogonal experimental design, quadratic polynomial stepwise regression, and response surface methodology to analyze the results. The findings indicated that the optimal conditions for spray drying were an inlet temperature of 162°C, an outlet temperature of 84°C, and a sample concentration of 3.4g/200ml. Under these conditions, the product yield was 56.432%, and the rehydration rate was 183.647%.

China is a prominent beer-producing country, and distillers' hops, a byproduct of beer production, are abundantly generated each year. Given its rich nutritional content and high water content, distillers' hops are prone to spoilage, presenting challenges for their treatment and utilization. To address this issue, the study investigated the suitability of spray drying as a method to protect the original attributes of distillers' hops, and examined factors affecting their yield and rehydration properties.

The experimental setup involved the drying and labeling of centrifuge tubes, followed by the addition of sample and water, vortexing, and centrifugation to assess the rehydration rate. Subsequently, the distillers' hops were subjected to spray drying under specific conditions determined through prior experimentation.

The data collected were analyzed using quadratic polynomial stepwise regression, resulting in the establishment of mathematical models that facilitated the optimization of process conditions. The study identified the relationship between yield and rehydration rate and various influencing factors, ultimately determining the optimal combination of inlet temperature, outlet temperature, and feed concentration for the spray drying process.

The results suggested that the models developed were reasonable and reliable for predicting the yield and rehydration rate of samples. Drawing on response surfaces and considering the interactions of the studied factors, the study confirmed that the identified optimal conditions produced a yield of 56.432% and a rehydration rate of 183.647% in verification tests.

Finally, it is worth noting that this research was supported by funding from the Sichuan Provincial Department of Education and the Science & Technology Project of Sichuan University of Science & Engineering. The authors also expressed gratitude to China Resources Snow Breweries (Zigong) Co., Ltd. for providing the distillers' hops used in the study.
