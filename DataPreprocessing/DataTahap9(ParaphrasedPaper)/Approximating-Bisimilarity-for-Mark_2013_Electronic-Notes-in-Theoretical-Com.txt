Markov processes with continuous state spaces are crucial mathematical models used in various fields such as physics, biology, finance, and computer science. The behavior of these processes is determined by their current state rather than their past history. As computer technology continues to advance, it is increasingly important to develop a theory for computationally handling these significant structures. In order to compute them, it is necessary to create a framework for approximating Markov processes with continuous state spaces, while ensuring that the approximations are accurate.

Originally, Danos et al. aimed to introduce event bisimulation as a less strict form of state bisimulation. However, based on the example provided (adapted from example 4.11), it is evident that a state bisimulation r is not universally an event bisimulation, although a closely-related broader state bisimulation r(a(r)) does indeed function as an event bisimulation (as indicated in part 4 of the following proposition).
