For instance, the potential applications of reachability can be demonstrated through the context of drug delivery. In this scenario, a drug molecule contained within a specific transport molecule is administered to a patient's bloodstream. The conduct of the hosting molecule should ensure that the drug molecule is transported to muscular tissue rather than connective tissue. This system can be represented by a bioambient process.

In a separate study, Busi and Zavattaro expanded on their previous work concerning the decidability of reachability for mobile ambients in two ways. Firstly, they introduced a broader concept of reachability known as target reachability, which allows for the specification of a potentially infinite set of targets through the representation of ambient nesting structure and the indication of lower and upper bounds for the number of specific process instances hosted within each ambient. Secondly, they established the decidability of target reachability for an extended calculus that incorporates advanced communication mechanisms of boxed ambients.

The demonstrable decidability of target reachability is achieved through reduction to petri net marking reachability, which is a decidable property for petri nets. The reduction involves two steps: the definition of target marking reachability for petri nets and the demonstration that it can be reduced to marking reachability. Subsequently, the reduction of target reachability in bioambients to target marking reachability in petri nets is outlined. Due to space constraints and the similarity to the previous proof for boxed ambients, the specific details are omitted and can be found in the full version of the paper.

Proposition 3.9 states that for a p/t system n=(s, t, m0) and a target marking (inf, sup), the target marking (inf, sup) is reachable in n if one of the markings in the set tmm ark(n,(inf, sup)) is reachable in tmsys(n,(inf, sup)).

Unfortunately, this subset of p-derivatives is generally infinite, as the processes within an ambient can grow indefinitely. For instance, consider the process p=[!local n!{m}|!local n?{p}.q]. It is evident that for any k, [!local n!{m}|{enter k.q, g} is associated with the first son of the root, {accept k.0} is associated with the second son of the root, {c2p n?{p}.r} is associated with the third son of the root, and the empty multiset {} with the son of the third son of the root.

The constructed petri net consists of two parts: the first part functions as a finite state automaton, where the marked place represents the existing tree-like structure of the process, while the second part comprises identical subnets, where the marking of each subnet represents the multiset associated with a specific node of the tree. Labels are used to maintain the correspondence between the nodes of the tree and the associated multiset, with each subnet being assigned a distinct label that is utilized in the tree-like structure to label the node whose contents are represented by the subnet.
