In this paper, we expand the existing formalism to accommodate continuous systems by introducing continuous variables and their first and second-order derivatives. This enables the analysis and verification of programs that discretely control continuously physical or other external systems.

Section 2 presents the formal system and the semantics of TA, originally documented in [citation]. Section 3 introduces and analyzes a vehicle control system, using the example of a car merging with traffic at a T junction. We formulate the problem, and formally analyze and verify the conditions under which the merging car avoids collisions with other vehicles.
