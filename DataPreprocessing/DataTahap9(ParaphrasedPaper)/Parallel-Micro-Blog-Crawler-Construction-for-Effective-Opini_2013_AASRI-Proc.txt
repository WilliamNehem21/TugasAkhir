It is crucial to conduct research aimed at identifying opinion leaders in the context of the increasing number of microblog users worldwide. Governments in various countries have recognized the importance of analyzing and regulating the dissemination of messages on microblogs and other social networks, given the influential role of opinion leaders in information propagation. This article presents a tool developed for crawling and analyzing microblogs based on Sina Weibo APIs. Additionally, a novel MapReduce-based crawler and node betweenness approximation computation method are proposed to more accurately and efficiently detect core opinion leaders in microblog networks.

The subsequent sections of the article are organized as follows: Section II provides an in-depth review of related research on complex network analysis for betweenness computation, node centrality, and parallel computing, focusing on three centralities crucial for analyzing social networks and detecting important opinion leaders. Section III details the Sina Weibo APIs-based crawler, while Section IV presents the parallel design details of the parallel Sina Weibo crawler. In Section V, an effective betweenness approximation algorithm for large-scale graphs is developed and evaluated through experiments on real Sina Weibo user social network data. Finally, Section VI concludes the paper.

Furthermore, the researchers utilized MPI and Hadoop to develop a parallel program aimed at enhancing algorithm efficiency. The complex nature of programming methods and theories of MPI often presents challenges for developers, and existing methods and algorithms do not construct a node betweenness approximation algorithm for the entire social network, particularly in the context of large-scale graphs within MapReduce APIs. Therefore, it is necessary to develop such algorithms within the MapReduce API to reduce computational complexity.

The proposed approximation computation method for large-scale social graphs proves to be beneficial for emergency situations, such as during a rainstorm, as it yields better accuracy at a lower computational cost. By enabling the detection of important opinion leaders in social networks within large-scale graphs and in parallel data mining, the algorithm offers practical utility.
