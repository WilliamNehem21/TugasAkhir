In this academic paper, the authors explore and explain several sound and complete classes of models for computational calculus, discussing their definitions and motivations for studying them. The first class considered is closed categories, which are a natural extension of the concept of cartesian closed categories. They then delve into the study of closed categories based on indexed categories, which are closely linked to modern compiling technology. Finally, they examine the class of cartesian closed categories along with c-enriched monads, which boasts a well-developed abstract theory that allows for the avoidance of coherence details in the manner of Mac Lane. 

The authors emphasize that cartesian closed categories together with c-enriched monads obviate the need for strengths, which proves to be advantageous in proving abstract mathematical results. This approach aligns with the extensive body of work on enriched categories, enabling the use of the well-studied 2-category c-cat of small c-enriched categories and facilitating straightforward proofs of relationships between computational effects. For example, it allows for the consideration of partiality as part of continuations via c-enriched map of monads, without requiring meticulous consideration of the relationships between the strengths at every step. Additionally, this approach is well-suited for modeling operations associated with computational effects and facilitates the account of recursion in the models. 

The authors also introduce the concept of c-categories, which are constructed based on cartesian closed (or more generally symmetric monoidal closed) category c. Instead of having homsets as in the usual definition of category, a c-category has a homobject of c. They proceed to provide a formal definition of this concept.
