The author of the paper argues that traditional clone theory, despite focusing on subclones of the clone of all non-nullary operations, remains valuable within the broader context of new clones. The author believes that it is beneficial for the exchange of knowledge and methods that the notions of term operation, clone, abstract clone, and Lawvere theory are compatible with each other, allowing for the inclusion of nullary operations within clones. They note that recent work has also suggested the possibility of including nullary operations in clone theory.

In subsection 3.1, the author plans to define four operators on sets of finitary operations and relations in order to explore the connection between traditional clones (without nullary operations) and new, general clones. The operators will be used to locate the lattices of traditional clones within the lattices of new clones, and to identify clones that are strictly new and not part of the traditional theory. The paper also discusses the positions of traditional clones in the lattice of new general clones in subsection 3.1.3.

The author acknowledges that there has been some reluctance among authors to rely on these results for clones involving nullary operations, possibly due to the desire to be compatible with traditional clone theory and to avoid unexpected technical modifications. Therefore, the author believes it is useful to provide a reliable source for the main theorem regarding the Galois theory for clones involving nullary operations, in order to demonstrate that no modifications are necessary. Ideally, this will lead to a broader acceptance of clones with nullary operations among universal algebraists.
