3.3 to 3.5 billion years ago, cyanobacteria could be found in a wide range of habitats, including fresh and salty water, polluted lakes and ponds, soil, rocks, and tree barks. They exhibited diverse morphological forms, ranging from unicellular to filamentous or colonial forms. Some species of cyanobacteria thrived in thermal springs and exhibited thermophilic characteristics. Additionally, certain cyanobacteria displayed environmentally friendly behavior by fixing atmospheric nitrogen and solubilizing phosphate. Cyanobacteria were recognized as a valuable source of primary metabolites, such as polysaccharides, proteins, fats, oils, vitamins, pigments, and hydrocarbons. They were also known to produce a variety of secondary metabolites with biological activities, including antiviral, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, cytotoxic, and immunosuppressive properties. Research in the past few decades has focused on the production of extracellular antibiotic metabolites by marine microalgae, as well as the discovery of other pharmacologically active compounds. Furthermore, cyanobacteria were found to contain important compounds with antioxidant activity, such as ascorbic acid, reduced glutathione, phenolic compounds, and flavonoids. Traditional methods of production factor manipulation were found to be time-consuming and labor-intensive. However, statistically designed two-level factorial experiments have proven to be effective tools for optimizing microbial culture conditions. The objective of this study was to use response surface methodology (RSM) to assess the effects of medium composition on the production of bioactive compounds by the cyanobacterium Anabaena oryzae. The flavonoid content of Anabaena oryzae extract samples was measured using the aluminum chloride method described by Barku. The addition of an increased concentration of iron (from 5mm to 15mm) was shown to cause a notable decrease in antibiotic production, echoing similar findings reported by Ohta et al.
