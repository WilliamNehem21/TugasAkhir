Normandin et al. conducted a study to investigate the temporal and spatial dynamics of host-pathogen interactions in Ebola virus disease (EVD) using a natural history study in rhesus monkeys. They analyzed over 400 samples using bulk transcriptomics, which revealed significant changes in host gene expression and the emergence of viral mutations specific to individual tissues.

The study emphasizes the significance of addressing filovirus threats, including EVD and other diseases such as Marburg virus disease. EVD is a classic viral hemorrhagic fever with severe clinical manifestations, but the determinants of disease severity and the underlying molecular pathobiology remain unclear.

The researchers analyzed host transcriptional responses across tissues and observed tissue-specific changes in gene expression related to pathogenesis. They discovered novel responses associated with tissue connectivity and identified previously unknown features of the disease, such as dysregulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) genes and collagen cleaving enzymes in various tissues. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying severe EVD and may offer implications for other hemorrhagic fevers.

The study contributes new spatial and temporal granularity to our understanding of EVD and proposes potential molecular drivers of pathogenesis. Additionally, the researchers provide computational and experimental tools to facilitate further investigations of EVD infections and to guide future studies aiming to identify the molecular bases of disease progression.

The study authors also highlight the diversity of their team, with one or more authors identifying as underrepresented ethnic minorities, gender minorities, members of the LGBTQIA+ community, individuals living with disabilities, and recipients of support programs designed to increase minority representation in research.

The research was conducted following ethical guidelines for the care and use of experimental animals. Tissue homogenates and viral samples were processed following established laboratory protocols, and viral load was measured using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). In addition, the researchers conducted an assay to assess the impact of viral proteins on host cells.

Overall, the study significantly contributes to our understanding of EVD pathogenesis and provides valuable tools and insights for future research in this area.
