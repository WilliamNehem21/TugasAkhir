Various convexities in graphs have been extensively researched due to their wide range of applications, such as in distributed systems, social networks, and marketing strategies, as evidenced by several scholarly works [2,4,5]. Additionally, the helly property on graphs has received significant attention in past studies. This paper focuses on investigating the helly property on the p3-convexity of a graph, marking the first comprehensive exploration of computational aspects related to this concept. The study examines the inclusion of edges incident to specific vertices in the edge p3-convex hull, as well as the presence of middle edges, and addresses edge restrictions and contradictions within this context. Furthermore, it explores the implications of truth assignments in terms of centers of stars and their coverage of literal counterparts, as well as the non-adjacency of these centers. The paper also discusses the selection of vertices for large cliques and their relation to edge p3-helly-independent sets. Overall, the paper delves into critical aspects of graph theory and computational analysis, shedding light on previously unexplored layers of understanding within this field.
