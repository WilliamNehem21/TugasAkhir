A tree can be defined as a network structure containing a single designated free port known as the root. It can consist of a single wire with a randomly fixed root, or it can be formed by connecting the auxiliary ports of a cell with the root of smaller trees. In the latter case, the root serves as the free port that is linked to the principal port of the cell.
