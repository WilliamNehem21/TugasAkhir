The paper discusses the application of optimization techniques for reversible and quantum circuits, focusing on the synthesis process and its effects on circuit size. It also presents a case study evaluating the impact of these techniques. The work is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces the basics of reversible and quantum logic and Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs); Section 3 provides a brief review of the synthesis approach; Section 4 describes the new BDD-based synthesis approach that supports shared nodes, complement edges, and reorderings; Section 5 experimentally evaluates the effect of these optimizations on circuit sizes; and finally, Section 6 concludes the paper.

The paper points out that synthesis of reversible and quantum circuits differs from traditional design due to restrictions on fan-out and feedback, making it an area of intense research. The proposed improved BDD-based synthesis approach supports shared nodes, complement edges, and different orderings, and the effects of these optimizations on circuit sizes are experimentally evaluated in a case study, showing significant reductions in circuit size in most cases.

The paper also discusses the potential for future work in adjusting optimization techniques for synthesis purposes with respect to expected circuit size, rather than BDD size, and considering other decompositions.
