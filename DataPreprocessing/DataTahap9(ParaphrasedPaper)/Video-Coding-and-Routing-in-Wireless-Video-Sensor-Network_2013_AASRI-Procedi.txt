A new type of networks known as wireless sensor networks (WSNs), which was presented by Yick et al. in 2008, consists of multiple intelligent sensor nodes that collaborate to sense and monitor either indoor or outdoor environments. Each sensor node is equipped with one or more sensors, a processor, memory, a power source (typically a battery), a radio, and an actuator. The sensors can be of various types, such as mechanical, thermal, biological, chemical, optical, or magnetic, depending on the application. Wireless sensor nodes have constraints in terms of energy, communication range, transmission link capacity, and processing and storage capabilities. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider the application and environment when designing a WSN.

The coverage percentage in wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSNs) refers to the area of the environment being monitored. Chen et al. (to appear in IEEE Sensors Journal) proposed an algorithm for enhancing coverage, called the Overlap-Sense Ratio Coverage-Enhancing Algorithm (OSRCEA), which aims to increase coverage and prolong the lifetime of WMSNs by shutting off redundant sensors. This algorithm involves determining the rotation angle of a sensor node using the overlap-sense ratio (OSR), and the rotating direction is decided based on the centroid of overlapping regions. Additionally, Yildiz et al. (to appear in IEEE Transactions on Computers) addressed the issue of finding optimal camera placement to provide angular coverage in WMSN.

Sarisaray-Boluk (2012) compared different image quality evaluation techniques in WMSNs, considering factors such as packet size, link and node correlation effects, and loss areas on the performance of image quality assessment (IQA) metrics such as PSNR, WSNR, SSIM, and VIF. The study found that packet size and link and node correlation do not affect PSNR, and larger packets lead to a decrease in WSNR while increasing SSIM and VIF. The author also proposed and evaluated a method called Block-Based Weighted Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (WBPSNR) to evaluate image quality in real-time, and suggested combining IQA metrics using weights.

Compressed sensing, also known as compressive sampling, has been proposed as an alternative to conventional video codecs with the aim of building encoders with very low computational complexity. Pudlewski et al. (2012) introduced the C-DMRC algorithm based on compressed sensing for streaming video over wireless multimedia sensor networks. This system comprises a distributed rate controller, video encoder, and a channel encoding scheme with adaptive parity using low-complexity video sensor nodes.

Tsai and Lin (2012) proposed an approach for video sensor networks (VSNs) to increase coding efficiency and decrease coding complexity by exploiting existing redundancy related to foreground and background objects in the image. The proposed coding involves classifying macroblocks with distinguished context and compressing them.

Kandris et al. (2011) proposed a routing scheme that combines an energy-efficient routing protocol with a scheduling algorithm for video packets. The hierarchical routing protocol selects routes and manages network load based on the residual energy of sensor nodes, and it incorporates an analytical distortion prediction model in the video packet scheduling algorithm to minimize distortion. The authors also extended their work to include scalable video coding, where base video layer streams can be routed over high-transmission-quality routes, while lower-quality routes can be used to transport enhancement layers video streams.

It is possible to achieve lower energy consumption or communication cost by applying information theory using network combinatorics through network coding (NC) and distributed source coding (DSC). Li et al. (2011) proposed a coding and routing mechanism using an analytic power-rate-distortion (P-R-D) model for distributed video coding (DVC) to reduce video distortion and prolong network lifetime. Dai et al. (2012) proposed the CAQR scheme to minimize the energy consumed by wireless video sensor nodes under delay and reliability quality of service (QoS) constraints, leveraging the inherent correlation in the perceived scene information. This scheme employs correlation-aware compression/decompression using differential coding between intra-coded frames to reduce the size of generated traffic and performs correlation-aware load balancing. 

Moreover, Dai et al. (2012) integrated these two correlation-aware schemes into a distributed optimization QoS routing framework targeting reduced energy consumption of nodes.

This paper also highlights several potential future research issues in WMSNs, such as the need for routing protocols to achieve high QoS and energy conservation, the joint compression, aggregation, and routing of video under QoS constraints to minimize energy consumption, and congestion-aware routing algorithms. Additionally, it points out that the optimal placement of sensor cameras is necessary to reduce redundancy and that the mobility of sensor nodes or tracked objects presents additional challenges to video-sensing applications. Furthermore, robust protocols are needed for data aggregation and fusion when WMSNs are used to collect various multimedia data.

In summary, wireless video sensor networks hold promise for various applications in human life. This paper surveys recent research papers addressing different aspects of WMSNs, with a focus on video coding and routing, and outlines future research directions and open issues in this active research area.
