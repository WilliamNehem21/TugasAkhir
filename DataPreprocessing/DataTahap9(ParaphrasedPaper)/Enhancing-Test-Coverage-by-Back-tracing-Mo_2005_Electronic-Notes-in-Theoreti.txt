We employ the procedure outlined in section 2.1 to analyze module s0, generating a path that illustrates the necessary inputs for exercising the uncovered branch. It is assumed that these inputs for s0 are produced as outputs by the preceding module, s1.

To eliminate false counterexamples of this nature, it is necessary to only consider the paths of ac1 that align with the paths of ac0. This process essentially involves synchronizing ac0 and ac1 based on their common actions, denoted as ac1/gac0, where g represents the set of common actions (in this case, a, b, c, d, e).

While we have presented the proposed approach using a single illustrative example, along with specific formalisms and verification tools, we believe that the approach holds general applicability. Work is currently underway to implement the approach using both explicit model checking (as demonstrated in the paper) and BDD-based symbolic model-checking, with a focus on LTSS and action-based temporal logics.

A related outcome to our work is the definition of more comprehensive tree-like counterexamples for Kripke structures and CTL, which are utilized to guide a refinement technique. A key distinction from our approach is that a tree-like counterexample serves as a complete proof of the formula's invalidity. In contrast, our counterexample automaton provides a set of all linear counterexamples, each of which can be considered individually as a traditional counterexample. A recent development in tree-like counterexamples is the emergence of proof-like counterexamples, which are utilized to derive proofs for the non-satisfiability of a formula over a model. In closer alignment with our approach is the multiple counterexamples generation described in [6,10], which produces all the counterexamples of a given length, expressed as a singular counterexample trace annotated with potential values of binary variables.
