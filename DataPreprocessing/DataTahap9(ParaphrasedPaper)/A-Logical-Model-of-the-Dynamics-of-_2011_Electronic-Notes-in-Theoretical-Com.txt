When links are removed, the situation becomes more complex in the case of [x<y]. It becomes necessary to remove additional links for repair, and there may not be a single optimal way to do this. Consequently, the process of upgrading preferences to enforce strictness while maintaining transitivity becomes non-deterministic. To simplify the analysis for the remainder of the paper, we will focus exclusively on the non-transitivity-preserving but deterministic operator.

If the system is initially in state z, it cannot remain there and must transition to either y or n. Additionally, according to Lemma 5.2, it is impossible for the system to enter state i. Therefore, the only recurring pattern involves switching from y to n and back. By symmetry, we can assume that n, a|= y and n+1, a|= n. This can only occur through strong suggestion, so n, a|= sn, which implies n, a|= f n.
