The paper discusses the use of the Mooat tool to combine modularity aspects from the object-oriented approach with efficient execution and analysis in the Maude system, specifically for describing syntax-independent specifications of programming languages. It presents the idea of Constructive Object-Oriented Action Semantics (COOAS) as a way to increase the modularity characteristics of both denotational and operational semantics. The paper is structured as follows: it introduces the Maude MSOS tool, provides an overview of object-oriented action semantics, summarizes constructive action semantics, and explains the Mooat notation and implementation. It also discusses how constructive semantics can be applied to object-oriented action semantics using the Mooat tool. Additionally, the paper compares the Mooat notation with the OOAS notation, and introduces the concept of automatic object creation. It describes the use of data notation, reusing datatypes, and the inclusion of specialized classes to implement specific language constructs. The paper concludes with acknowledgments and gratitude to the authors and organizers.
