In this paper, we address two open issues presented by Karen L. Bernstein in relation to her proposed promoted tyft format for structured operational semantics. Our findings demonstrate that, unlike formats with closed terms as labels, such as the tyft format, the assumption of well-foundedness cannot be removed for the promoted tyft format while still maintaining the congruence result. Additionally, we establish that the well-founded promoted tyft format cannot be directly compared to the tyft format with closed terms as labels, as certain transition relations can be specified by one format but not the other, and vice versa.

Bernstein introduced the promoted tyft format as a sophisticated framework for defining the operational semantics of higher-order processes. She verified that the well-founded promoted tyft format ensures that strong bisimilarity functions as a congruence. Furthermore, the operational semantics of the lazy lambda-calculus and the calculus of higher-order communicating systems (CHOCS) were represented using the promoted tyft format. By utilizing the congruence meta-theorem, it was demonstrated that applicative bisimilarity for the lazy lambda-calculus and strong bisimilarity for CHOCS both operate as congruences. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides basic definitions, Section 3 discusses the concept of well-foundedness and illustrates its necessity for the promoted tyft format in preserving the congruence result, Section 4 explores the expressiveness of the promoted tyft format and establishes its incomparability to the tyft format, and finally, Section 5 presents the conclusion.

This paper also examines a subset of the tyft format that employs constants (as opposed to closed terms) as labels, which is addressed in Section 4 and compared to the promoted tyft format. This subset may be viewed as the original definition of the tyft format, as defined by Bernstein. The extension to closed terms as labels, if considered at all, is entirely independent and orthogonal to all existing results, such as the meta-theorems related to congruence, conservativity, and commutativity.
