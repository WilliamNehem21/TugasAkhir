Addressing delayed vehicles is an essential concern for public transportation companies. When a vehicle arrives at a station later than scheduled, decisions must be made about whether connecting vehicles should wait for passengers or depart on time. One possible objective is to minimize the total delays experienced by all customers using the transportation network. This paper formulates the problem of managing delays as a mixed integer linear program and proposes solution approaches based on this formulation.

Delays are a significant source of complaints in public transportation, and their complete elimination seems impractical. Passengers using delayed vehicles are likely to reach their destinations later than planned. Additionally, those seeking to transfer to another vehicle may miss their connection and face a prolonged wait for the next departure. This paper examines these effects and presents a model for handling delays.

The transportation network is described using the sets of stations (v) and vehicles (f), with each vehicle having a set of driving edges within the network. Connections between vehicles at stations are denoted as (i, j, k). The paper introduces scenarios for calculating the delays for passengers taking specific routes, taking into account the arrival delay of their last vehicle at the destination station.

The proposed formulation can be interpreted as an event-activity network, where nodes represent vehicle arrivals and departures at stations. The paper also discusses ongoing efforts to collect real data on customer behavior and to implement and test the heuristics outlined in Section 3. Additionally, a branch-and-bound approach, utilizing branching variables and bounds developed earlier, is being considered. Further details are provided in the upcoming sections.
