Huang and Gao explained that location-based services (LBS) are mobile applications that deliver information to users based on their location. Mohammadi et al. suggested that push or pull LBS can be used depending on the type of information to be communicated to the user. Yassin et al. noted that GPS is the most commonly used technology for outdoor LBS, utilizing localization techniques such as Global System for Mobile Communications to estimate user position. Simulation of the designed model was conducted using MATLAB, focusing on the Rift Valley region due to its high incidence of fatal accidents. The research selected a dataset of 15 black spots for the study, aiming to determine the effectiveness of the proposed model through simulation.

Two scenarios were tested, each involving a vehicle moving across the 15 black spots. During the movement, the vehicle received alerts as it approached black spots, enabling the driver to reduce speed and avoid potential accidents. Some instances resulted in the vehicle failing to receive an alert, attributed to factors affecting the performance of RFID or GPS. The study aimed to calculate the usability of the proposed framework by evaluating its effectiveness, defined by the successful performance of tasks and task completion rate, as suggested by Sauro.

The proposed framework integrated the capabilities of both GPS and RFID in location-based service to achieve effectiveness, registering a low alert error rate, which is crucial for critical road locations. The utilization of GPS or RFID alone resulted in a high error rate due to limitations such as line of sight for GPS and interferences or faultiness for RFID. The study found that in-vehicle sound system audio alerts were more preferable compared to visual signs, which may lead to visual overload and high resource demands, as observed by Spence and Ho (2008, 2009) and Sivak (1996).

The primary objective of the research was to design a framework for preventing road accidents at black spots. The analysis of death statistics highlighted that human factors are the main cause of road accident-related deaths. As LBS aims to provide relevant information to motorists for sound decision-making, it was observed that the information delivered to drivers could influence their behavior, ultimately preventing human errors that contribute to fatal accidents.
