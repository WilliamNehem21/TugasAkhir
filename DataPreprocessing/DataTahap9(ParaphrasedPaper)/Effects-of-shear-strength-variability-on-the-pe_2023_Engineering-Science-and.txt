The distribution of shear strength in pipelines is discussed in this paper, with an emphasis on presenting the results of parametric runs in graphical charts. These charts allow for the identification of high and low embedment and lateral friction factors for selected mean shear strength and coefficient of variation (cov) pairs. The study observes similar trends in the charts for all evaluated pipelines, finding that the range of normalized embedment (z/d) increases with increasing cov and decreases with increasing mean shear strength for all tested pipelines. A similar trend is also observed for residual horizontal resistance. Furthermore, the paper discusses the development of design methodologies focused on identifying key factors and mechanisms influencing pipeline embedment and lateral buckling. Various models have been proposed to predict the embedment of pipelines resting on a clay seabed, and several projects have led to the development and updates of design guidelines in the oil and gas industry.

The paper acknowledges the deterministic nature of the developed methodologies, highlighting the need to account for variability in input parameters during the design process. It discusses the estimation of variability in undrained shear strength of seabed soil and presents a parametric study investigating the influence of soil strength heterogeneity on the calculated embedment and lateral friction factors of pipelines resting on a clay seabed. The study uses a psi calculation tool written in the R code language, and the results of the parametric study are evaluated for selected pipeline size and shear strength ranges. Additionally, the paper emphasizes the importance of extensive structural analyses during the design stage, using probabilistic, analytic, and finite element tools to assess potential stress loading and fatigue damage over the design life.

The paper also discusses the need for improved prediction of pipeline embedment to narrow the range of pipe-soil responses obtained. It presents refinements to embedment calculations, including methods to account for dynamic effects of the installation process and changes in strength arising from large lateral movement of the pipeline. Furthermore, the paper addresses the impact of soil consolidation and changes in soil consistency on pipe-soil interaction, as well as the calculation of additional pipeline embedment associated with increased loads during the hydrotest phase.

The study outlines the development of an R code, psi-lateral, for performing psi calculations based on mathematical models and best practice guidelines, verifying the results against published data from the literature. It presents a parametric study to evaluate the impact of strength variability on the lateral response of pipelines of different diameters and weights. The paper emphasizes the use of non-dimensional units to compare different cases and discusses the implications of shear strength variability on design variables such as horizontal peak and residual resistances and respective friction factors. Additionally, the study acknowledges the limitations of deterministic approaches and discusses the potential use of probabilistic methods for handling uncertainty.

In summary, the paper provides a comprehensive overview of shear strength distribution in pipelines and discusses the development of design methodologies, the impact of soil variability on pipeline response, and the use of computational tools for parametric studies and design assessment.
