This paper introduces a new variant of the differential evolution (DE) algorithm, called Restart Differential Evolution Algorithm with Local Search Mutation (RDEL), which incorporates a novel local mutation rule inspired by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to enhance the local search capability of the basic DE algorithm and improve convergence speed. To prevent stagnation and premature convergence, a restart mechanism is integrated into RDEL, employing both random mutation and a modified Breeder Genetic Algorithm (BGA) mutation scheme. Additionally, an exponent-increased crossover probability rule and uniform scaling factors are introduced to promote population diversity and enhance the search process.

Extensive numerical experiments and comparisons with other DE variants on a set of well-known benchmark functions demonstrate that RDEL outperforms basic DE and state-of-the-art parameter adaptive DE variants in terms of solution quality, efficiency, and robustness.

Previous research has proposed various techniques to improve the performance of DE algorithms, such as the Self-Adaptive Differential Evolution (SDE) algorithm, the Self-Adaptive Differential Evolution with an Ensemble Approach (EPSDE) algorithm, and the Self-Adaptive Differential Evolution (JDE) algorithm. These algorithms have shown promising results in terms of solution quality and robustness compared to conventional DE and other state-of-the-art parameter adaptive DE variants. Additionally, the proposed local mutation rule in RDEL is inspired by the social-psychological principles mimicked in PSO, which allows each vector to learn from the best and worst individuals in the population, striking a balance between global exploration and local exploitation. However, an emphasis on enhancing local search capability may lead to premature convergence or stagnation, which is addressed in RDEL through the incorporated restart mechanism utilizing random mutation and a modified BGA mutation scheme.
