Runners bear some resemblance to handlers, but one significant distinction is that runners exhibit polymorphism in the set of values. For instance, handling enables the extraction of a value from a non-deterministic computation (a binary wellfounded leaf tree) over a specific value set that carries a binary operation by folding this operation over the leaf labels. (If a non-deterministic computation is defined as a nonempty list of values, this operation must be associative.) Running, on the other hand, does not permit such actions. From our perspective, the practical implications of handlers and runners differ: handlers serve as a programming language construct, whereas runners function as compilation schemes.
