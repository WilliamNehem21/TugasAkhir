The equivalence between typed and type assignment proofs implies that applying the erasing function j to all terms in a typed proof results in a correct type assignment proof, and vice versa. Understanding the exact mechanics of introducing and eliminating the universal quantifier rules is crucial. However, we believe that the significance of our study goes beyond the practical application of creating a usable language. The interplay between typed and type assignment systems is a significant theoretical concern that is inherently intriguing.
