Various technologies were employed in precision farming, including remote sensing, GPS, and GIS. The key aspect of precision farming is the creation of detailed soil maps, which involves grid soil sampling, yield monitoring, and crop scouting. Remote sensing, in conjunction with GPS coordinates, enabled the accurate mapping of agricultural fields. Data collection was primarily conducted through electronic sensors such as soil probes and remote optical scanners, leading to the development of GIS databases. Statistical analysis was performed to chart the variability of agricultural land properties. However, these technologies were non-real time and required expensive resources, such as satellite sensing, and were labor-intensive due to manual mapping.

The Egyptian economy heavily relies on the agricultural sector, which supports the livelihood of a significant portion of the population and contributes a substantial percentage to the GDP. The consumption and export of agricultural products, specifically potatoes, play a crucial role in the economy.

Egypt's potato exports fluctuated over the years, with varying quantities exported to different regions. The cultivation of potatoes in Egypt occurs continuously throughout the year, with different planting periods and harvesting times, serving both local and export markets.

The potato crop in Egypt faces various challenges, including fungal, bacterial, nematode, and viral diseases, as well as insect pests. Efficient solutions for the early detection and prevention of these pathogens and pests are crucial and can be addressed using wireless sensor networks.

Periodic, threshold-sensitive, energy-efficient sensor networks (APTEEN) routing strategy is identified as the most suitable for precision farming due to its ability to respond to changes in sensed attributes, dynamic monitoring and control, and comprehensive querying system. APTEEN combines proactive and reactive policies, providing a complete network picture and immediate response to changes.

The scalability, lifetime, and energy dissipation of APTEEN make it superior to popular hierarchical routing protocols like LEACH and LEACH-C, demonstrating its suitability for precision farming. The paper emphasizes the significance of using wireless sensor networks in precision farming, particularly in addressing agricultural challenges in Egypt, with a focus on the potato crop as an example.
