The cloud environment offers a variety of services at different levels to support organizational processes. Cloud services have proven to be cost-effective, allowing organizations to maintain their data at minimal cost compared to traditional data management. By eliminating the need for organizations to maintain their own data servers, cloud service providers offer services at various levels, such as presentation, network, and data layers, enabling organizations to maintain their data at minimal cost while providing users with access to their data through different services.

The preprocessing algorithm identifies features and removes noise from the access trace dataset, while also determining and adding routes to reach the source and destination to the set. The extracted features and preprocessed traces are then used to approximate latency.

Cloud computing has gained widespread popularity as a storage and data access solution, made possible by the use of the internet and remote servers. Rather than owning physical resources, clients lease them from third-party providers. User management and key management are critical components of cloud computing, involving tasks such as user setup, key generation, expiration, and destruction. Data security is an important concern, especially when a suboptimal service is selected and data is encrypted. The proposed approach enhances the performance of various quality of service factors by reducing latency. As an extension of this research, multi-key homomorphic encryption techniques can be implemented to further enhance security and address cloud security challenges.
