The exchange subprotocol involves both participants generating secret commitments to a contract by generating nonces, hashing them to create public commitments, and subsequently exchanging their secret commitments. It is noted that the protocol must protect against abuse, such as a dishonest responder using the originator-signed part of the contract for negotiating with other agents. Additionally, two contrasting models are discussed: one with fairness constraints and the other without. The effectiveness aspect of the model is also highlighted, stating that when an honest agent receives an abort token for a session, it implies that either party has chosen to abort the contract.

Another aspect of interest is the analysis of the authentication properties of the protocol, particularly regarding the replay and confusion of nonces. The paper also addresses the intruder model and the need to differentiate between intruders and dishonest or corrupted agents.

The paper discusses the development of security protocols using the high-level protocol specification language (HLPSL) and the necessary constructs to model a database of aborted and resolved contracts maintained by the trusted third party. Several authentication problems are identified within the protocol, and it is noted that the protocol does not provide strong authentication or explicit protection against replay.

The paper acknowledges related works that focus on reasoning about security protocols and their guarantees, mentioning that the models used are more detailed and explicitly incorporate time-outs and distinguish between different types of agents. The authors express optimism about the applicability of their unified view to similar protocols, emphasizing the potential to understand and formalize security objectives and extend the applicability of existing methods for the formal analysis of security protocols.
