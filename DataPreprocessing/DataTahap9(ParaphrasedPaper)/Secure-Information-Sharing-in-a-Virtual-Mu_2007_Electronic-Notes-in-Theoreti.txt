In the realm of homeland security, a crucial obstacle lies in establishing efficient, timely, and organized cooperation and information exchange among various government agencies at the federal, state, and local levels. Due to the sensitive nature of the information, ensuring that information sharing is both relevant and secure is paramount. Many agencies are using the internet as a platform for sharing diverse information, often in the form of XML. In the event of a crisis, a virtual response team comprising members from different government agencies and private organizations needs to be assembled in an ad-hoc manner. The composition of this virtual multiagency response team (VMART) may vary from one crisis to another, depending on factors such as the crisis location and nature. Additionally, the membership of the VMART may dynamically change during the course of a crisis to accommodate various needs and constraints, such as public health concerns and jurisdictional boundaries.

The establishment of roles becomes necessary when an agency joins a VMART through an existing agency. For example, the New York Fire Department (NYFD) may create a new role for the New Jersey Fire Department (NJFD) if it requires assistance from NJFD and wishes to include it in the current VMART. This role creation is guided by specific policies discussed in detail in section 3.5.

To enable different agencies to access specific portions of an XML document, a document encryption and key generation scheme are proposed in section 3.6. The role-based access control model (RBAC) appears to be well-suited for the environment, as it associates permissions with roles and assigns users to roles based on their respective functions and responsibilities. RBAC facilitates the management of permissions, supports essential security principles, and is policy-neutral. A two-tier RBAC model is proposed, consisting of an inter-agency level (VMART members) and an intra-agency level.

In order to facilitate dynamic collaboration among agencies and the expansion of the VMART by admitting new collaborators as needed, the RBAC model is modified to allow a coordinator web service to create new roles. This modified RBAC model operates similarly to the self-evolving RBAC model. At the inter-agency level, an agency coordinator web service enforces both role permission assignment and role creation for collaborating agencies, whereas, at the intra-agency level, it enforces only role permission assignment for roles within the agency.

The specification of role creation and permission assignment privileges in the model includes a tuple for role permission assignment specification and constraints. Future work intends to extend this approach by merging the access control policies of collaborating agencies into a global access control policy, which would allow for the direct distribution of XML documents to roles within agencies. In addition, the evolution of these policies and the description of policies in terms of rights, obligations, dispensations, and prohibitions are identified as challenging issues that will be the focus of future work. Semantic differences between organizations due to variations in their organizational structure and document generation are also noted as issues to be addressed, with future research intending to explore ontology mapping and linking techniques to mitigate these differences.
