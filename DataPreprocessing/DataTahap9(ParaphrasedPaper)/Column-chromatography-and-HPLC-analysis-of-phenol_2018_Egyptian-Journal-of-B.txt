The research focused on the analysis of giant salvinia, also known as Salvinia molesta, a floating fern from the Salviniaceae family. The study separated active fractions of the fern extract using column chromatography and identified phenolic compounds in these active fractions through RP-HPLC. The ethyl acetate extract demonstrated significant pharmacological activity compared to other extracts, leading to an attempt to fractionate it. HPLC analysis revealed the presence of various phenolic compounds with specific retention times, including ascorbic acid, quercetin, gallic acid, resorcinol, catechol, vanillin, and benzoic acid, all of which possess antioxidant and antitumor properties.

Phenolic compounds are widespread in the plant kingdom and are characterized by hydroxylated aromatic rings. They are secondary metabolites derived from different plant pathways and are important for plant physiology and morphology. Many studies have highlighted the health-promoting activities of phenolic compounds due to their antioxidant properties and their potential in treating conditions such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and neurodegenerative diseases.

Researchers have identified biological properties in ferns, including anti-microbial, antioxidant, anti-proliferative, anti-inflammatory, and antitumor effects, among others. Phenolic compounds have been isolated from Salvinia molesta, with the study identifying two glycosides and five known compounds with potent free radical scavenging activity, showcasing characteristics that warrant further investigation.

The study detailed the collection and authentication of the plant materials, as well as the extraction and chromatographic separation of the active fractions of the ethyl acetate extract. The identified phenolic compounds from the fractions of the ethyl acetate extract indicate the promising medicinal properties of S. molesta, suggesting the need for further research to purify these compounds for potential use in developing novel antioxidant drugs.
