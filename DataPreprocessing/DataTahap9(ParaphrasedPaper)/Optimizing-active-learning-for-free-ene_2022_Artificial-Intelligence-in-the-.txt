The GPU calculations, spanning over 9.1 years, can be executed in parallel across multiple GPUs, but the expense of cloud computing resources may serve as a deterrent. For instance, running a set of RBFE calculations for 10,000 molecules at a cost of $2 per GPU hour would amount to $160,000. 

In a 2022 preprint, Gusev et al. applied AL and RBFE to the development of inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease (PLpro). The authors initially screened a large library of commercially available molecules, resulting in a set of 8175 docked structures. They then selected a diverse subset of 45 molecules for RBFE calculations using the thermodynamic integration (TI) method implemented in Amber 18. Additionally, an AutoQSAR simulation was carried out, utilizing the Schrodinger protein preparation and receptor grid generation workflows within Maestro with default settings, resulting in 66,250 successfully docked hits. Subsequently, stereo-expansion and deduplication reduced the number of hits to 39,527.

The study also investigated the impact of various design choices on the performance of AL methods when applied to RBFE calculations. The goal was to systematically compare the impact of certain design choices guiding the search within a chemical library of 10,000 molecules. The findings are relevant to the application of AL and RBFE calculations in a drug discovery program, acknowledging the importance of timely and cost-effective computational results in the context of drug discovery cycles.

Furthermore, the study compared different acquisition functions and highlighted that simple random initialization coupled with greedy acquisition performed comparably to other methods attempting to balance exploration and exploitation. The findings also suggested that the number of molecules chosen at each iteration significantly influenced performance. Additionally, the study suggested that an alternating strategy between extreme exploitation (greedy acquisition) and high exploration (half sampling acquisition) did not consistently improve overall recall or the diversity of recovered molecules.

The authors noted that the presented results may be specific to the dataset and survey design used in the study. They encouraged further comparisons and dataset releases to expand the understanding of AL and RBFE methods.
