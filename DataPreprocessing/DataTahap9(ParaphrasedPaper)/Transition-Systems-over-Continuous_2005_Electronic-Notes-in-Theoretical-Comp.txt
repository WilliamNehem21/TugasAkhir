To prevent this challenge, we introduce the concepts of fundamental functions and speed conditions. The basic idea behind a fundamental function is that it allows us to trace back the cause of each phenomenon to the initial condition. The formal definition of a fundamental function can be found in definitions 2.10 and 4.2. A speed condition is a set of rules governing the transition process. The intuitive interpretation of a speed condition is that a wave traveling at speed v does not produce effects faster than v. The formal definition of this concept is provided in definition 4.5.

In remark 3.14, the definition of the propagating speed of q incorporates the occurrences of states other than q. This is because the negative occurrences of states other than q can be transformed into positive occurrences of q through the replacement process, as described in remark 3.11.
