The continuous growth of the global population and the significant impact of environmental issues, particularly adverse weather conditions resulting from climate change, have raised concerns about ensuring a secure food supply, specifically with regard to crops. Accurate prediction of crop yield is crucial for national and international economies and plays a vital role in global food management. Therefore, it is important to provide farmers and food industries with precise models to predict crop productivity, enabling them to assess current productivity and efficiency levels and identify potential improvements such as soil enhancement and the selection of high-performance crop breeds. Additionally, such prediction models can assist managers in making decisions related to agronomy and crop selection policies to minimize losses due to unfavorable environmental conditions like drought and pest infestations.

With advances in computational technology and data collection, there is an increasing need to develop novel models for yield prediction. Researchers have presented various yield prediction models, including traditional machine learning algorithms, data mining methods, and deep neural network models. In recent years, deep learning-based models have been widely used in crop yield prediction due to their ability to model complex inputs with intricate interactions. For instance, You et al. (2017) introduced a deep Gaussian process framework for predicting crop yield using remote sensing data, effectively extracting relevant features from raw data using a novel dimensionality reduction method. Elavarasan and Vincent (2020) proposed a recurrent neural network deep learning algorithm to predict crop yield, achieving an accuracy of 93.7% using environmental, soil, water, and crop parameters. Furthermore, a deep convolutional neural network model was developed to extract key features from normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and RGB data to predict yield.

The performance evaluation of corn hybrids has also been a subject of interest. Corn, also known as maize, has become an important crop product, with various uses in the food industry, animal feed production, biofuel, and other industrial applications. Given the increasing demand for corn, farmers are exploring ways to enhance productivity, including the use of hybrids created through the crossing of parent plants to produce potentially stronger and more productive seeds. Hybrids are known to exhibit favorable qualitative traits and adaptability to different conditions, including heightened tolerance to drought compared to natural breeds. Identifying hybrids with the highest predicted yield has been a challenging task in agriculture, leading to the development of empirical breeding programs to explore the impact of breeding on crop yield and resistance to diseases and environmental factors. These programs involve selecting outstanding hybrids from inbred lines through extensive yield trials, which can be costly and time-consuming. However, breeders are now leveraging data analysis techniques to accurately predict hybrid yield prior to field evaluation, creating a demand for new approaches to predict hybrid performance.

This study was conducted as part of the 2020 Syngenta Crop Challenge, focusing on estimating the yield performance of corn hybrids by identifying the best parent combinations based on a dataset provided by the challenge. The dataset included yield data for 199,476 corn hybrids tested across 280 environments between 2016 and 2018. Multiple machine learning models were applied to the training set, and their performance was evaluated using a testing set. The data underwent preprocessing, including feature selection and encoding of categorical variables using different methods such as one-hot encoding, integer encoding, and feature hashing encoding. The xgboost model with one-hot encoded data demonstrated the best performance among the models evaluated, showing superior predictive capability.

The study revealed that the xgboost model, known for its ability to control overfitting, outperformed other models, aligning with results from previous studies in various fields. The proposed model can be used by managers or farmers to maximize yield by selecting the best hybrid, thereby reducing the cost of hybrid breeding trials and eliminating the time-consuming nature of the breeding process.

As for future work, the study suggests defining new criteria for clustering inbreds and testers, considering novel clustering approaches that may offer more informative insights for yield prediction, and incorporating new features into the dataset to enhance the accuracy of prediction models. The paper concludes by emphasizing the potential of machine learning algorithms in agricultural data analysis and the positive impact of using such tools in breeding programs to select outstanding hybrids and increase yield while reducing costs in the agricultural industry.
