Creol provides explicit control over data-flow synchronizations, and it has been expanded to support first class futures, although the access to futures is explicit. In contrast, other frameworks such as asp, proactive, and AmbientTalk have transparent first-class futures with non-blocking access. These frameworks enable transparent synchronization and data-flow-oriented behavior. 

In addition, a formalization of the Fractal component model using the alloy specification language is presented. Our work extends the component model presented in GCM, providing a semantics for hierarchical components, asynchronous communication, and first class futures. We have also formalized the component composition and communication semantics in the presence of futures. We have demonstrated that our formalization is complete and enables proofs on properties related to the implementation of futures, ensuring correctness of the implementation.

Furthermore, we classify future update strategies as either eager or lazy, and we have extended our model with precise definitions of future update strategies, including semantics and constructs for the management of futures. Our formalization involves complex mechanized proofs that demonstrate the correctness and completeness of our future update mechanism. 

This work represents a significant advancement in formal reasoning on components, their structure, and futures, and it demonstrates the ability to handle mechanized proofs entailing reasoning on components and their structure. The formalization represents a few hundred lines of code, while the proofs are much longer (above 5000 lines) and entail reasoning interleaving component structure, semantics, and future registration aspects.
