The fields of sentiment analysis, emotional development (e.g., happiness, sadness, anger), and the identification of moods and emotions in written or spoken texts are important areas in the domains of artificial intelligence and natural language processing. The Arabic language presents unique challenges due to its textual and phonetic structure, with each word carrying implicit or explicit positive or negative meanings. Arabic linguistic expression encompasses various forms such as prose, poetry, praise, and criticism, each of which involves diverse semantic structures that convey explicit or implicit meanings. This diversity allows for recognition of a writer's style by examining the meanings and emotional connotations of words, such as ridicule, praise, discontent, and love-hate.

In this study, we conducted a literature review to identify existing methods and algorithms used in sentiment analysis for the Arabic language. We also assessed the progress, limitations, and challenges in applying natural language processing techniques to Arabic text analysis. We found that compared to other languages, research on sentiment analysis in Arabic is relatively scarce, as most studies have been conducted in English.

This paper proposes a novel approach to Arabic sentiment analysis based on a six-level framework. Our findings are expected to be beneficial to researchers in this field. Specifically, Section 2 discusses the six-level framework for sentiment analysis in Arabic, along with a summary of the methodologies used. Sections 3 and 4 cover machine learning and corpus annotation, respectively, while Sections 5 and 6 present conclusions and future research directions.

Despite the significance of phonetic information in Arabic, there is a lack of published research on its use in sentiment analysis. We propose that phonetic information could enhance the representation and analysis of sentiment in the Arabic language, especially considering the various Arabic dialects and their distinctive pronunciations. Therefore, phonetically writing Arabic texts can provide valuable insights into the pronunciation and variations of words, contributing to a more nuanced sentiment analysis.

Several studies in related languages, such as Russian and Arabic Tunisian, have explored sentiment analysis using different methods. For instance, previous work has focused on extracting subjective opinions from Arabic news, constructing a lexicon for sentiment analysis based on parts of speech, and developing statistical algorithms to analyze sentiment in Arabic text.

The study of syntax and semantics is essential for sentiment analysis in the Arabic language. Syntax examines the relationship between words in a sentence, while semantics disambiguates word meanings based on context. Additionally, sentiment analysis at the concept level focuses on detecting sentiments conveyed by multi-word expressions.

Arabic sentiment corpora and datasets are not as extensively developed as those for other languages like English. Additionally, the annotation of Arabic corpora for sentiment analysis requires labeling features with appropriate classes and metadata. Annotated corpora are essential for training machine learning classifiers and addressing research issues in sentiment analysis at multiple levels.

Given the current state of research in sentiment analysis of the Arabic language, it is evident that comprehensive studies addressing all language levels are lacking. We encourage researchers to consider all levels of the Arabic language in sentiment analysis to produce meaningful results. This comprehensive approach may lead to significant advancements in natural language processing, automatic translation, and sentiment analysis in Arabic.
