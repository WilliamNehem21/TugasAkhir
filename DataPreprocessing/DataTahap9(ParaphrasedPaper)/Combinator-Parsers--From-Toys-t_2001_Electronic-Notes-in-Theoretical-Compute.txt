In section 2, we review the conventional parser combinators and examine the issues that arise. In section 3, we introduce basic machinery to incorporate error correction, resulting in very concise combinators suitable for small grammars. Section 4 demonstrates the extension of the combinators to compute look-ahead information in a demand-driven manner, minimizing the frequency of symbol inspection. Additionally, we present further extensions in section 5 and provide conclusions in section 7.

If we expand the combinators from the previous section to track the farthest point reached in the input, the parser only returns this value after backtracking is completed. However, at that point, all contextual information that could aid in determining the appropriate error correction steps is lost. To address this, we convert our combinators into a format that allows concurrent processing of all possible alternatives, transitioning from a depth-first to a breadth-first exploration of the search space. This breadth-first approach can be viewed as enabling multiple parsers to operate in parallel, each exploring a different possible route.

This type is a special case not permitted by the Haskell98 standard because it contains type variables 'b' and 'result' that are not arguments of the type parser. By utilizing the 'forall' construct, we indicate that the parser's type does not rely on these variables, and it is only through passing functions that we establish the type's connection to its environment. This extension is now supported by most Haskell compilers. The parser recognizing a value of type 'a' combines this value with the stack of previously discovered values, resulting in a new stack of type 'b', which is then passed to the continuation as the new stack.

In our final solution, we will integrate these two approaches. We will compute 'sents' fragments to inform parsing decisions and use continuation-based parsers to accept the symbols. Since the data structure closely resembles the information stored in the state of an LR(0) automaton, we adopt that terminology. Instead of constructing the complete 'sents' structure, we will create a similar structure that can be used to select the parser to proceed with.

The ':|:' operation represents a situation where we may either continue using further symbols to make a decision, or we must use information about the followers of this nonterminal. This is the only scenario where we continue with a potentially non-deterministic parsing process, analogous to a shift-reduce conflict in an LR(0) automaton.

The function 'mkparser' interprets a look structure and pairs it with its corresponding 'realparser'. It constructs a function 'choose' used in the resulting 'realparser' to select a 'realparser' 'p' based on the current input. Once selected, the parser 'p' is invoked. The resulting 'choose' function, a result of the homomorphism over the look structure, has the type 'input -> realparser a'.

While this definition may seem quite expensive, lazy evaluation saves the day. Note that these look structures are only used in the 'mkparser' function and are only examined for the branches until a 'found' or 'reduce' node is reached. If the grammar is LL(1), this process will only involve one step. Once 'mkparser' completes its task, the entire structure can be garbage collected.

In situations where the presence check and error correction behavior can be omitted, we simply take a single symbol from the input, incorporate it into the result, and continue parsing, recording the successful step by adding an 'ok-step'.

The computation of a full look-ahead may be expensive, especially if the choice structures become very large and are infrequently used. In such cases, a non-deterministic approach may be preferred. Dynamic versions are also available for this purpose with similar efficiency to the previously discussed backtracking approach.

The system can be expanded to incorporate the accumulation of any further necessary information, such as the name of the file being parsed, a line number, or an environment in which to locate specific identifiers. In such cases, the state should at least be capable of storing error messages and recognized symbols. Additional combinators have been introduced in the library to update the state.

Multiple inspections of a symbol may occur; where a bottom-up parser would encounter a shift-reduce conflict, we essentially pursue both paths until a difference is found. In a situation where the grammar is LR(1), this implies inspecting one symbol twice. We believe that, in practical scenarios, this approach is preferable to constructing full LR(1) parsers, where the number of states can quickly become unmanageable. The relatively low number of states in the LR(0) automaton, and thus in our approach, makes the LALR(1) handled by Yacc preferable over LR(1). Additionally, our approach seamlessly handles longer look-aheads when necessary, with the lazy evaluation effectively managing parallel pursuit for success, a task that would be cumbersome in C or Java.
