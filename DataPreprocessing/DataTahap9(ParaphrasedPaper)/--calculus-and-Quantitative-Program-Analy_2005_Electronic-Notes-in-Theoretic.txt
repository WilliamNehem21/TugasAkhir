In classical abstract interpretation, the methodology ensures the correctness of the abstract semantics that is constructed. In our quantitative context, the abstract semantics derived through this approach closely approximates the concrete semantics, which can be attributed to the connection between the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse and the least-square approximation, as described in references [7] and [5].
