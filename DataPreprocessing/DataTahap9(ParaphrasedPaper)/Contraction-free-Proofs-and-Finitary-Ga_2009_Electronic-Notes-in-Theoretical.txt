This perspective results in a coherent, yet incomplete gaming model for linear logic with exponentials, which is finite in nature, meaning that each play is finite. The game is constructed on a set of inference rules that does not support cut elimination. Nonetheless, the cut rule is applicable within the model.  

In this framework, an edge linking two validity concepts implies that the target is a model of the source, and a negated edge in the opposite direction suggests that the model is not comprehensive. We hypothesize that the vertical negated edges might be resolved by transitioning to local strategies according to a certain framework. However, the horizontal negated arrow cannot be remedied. 

(Without employing contraction or cut), in other scenarios, it is simply demonstrated that a series of new hypotheses beginning with '?' do not significantly obstruct the derivation, only resulting in the addition of weakenings and exchange rules, without involving cuts or contractions. 

On the left, the broken edge or formula is displayed, generating two subtrees depicted as triangles, and named to underscore the resemblance with inference rules. In the initial stage of the tensor movement (third line), there are several triangles linked to the left-hand vertex v, representing subtrees that solely share v as a common vertex.
