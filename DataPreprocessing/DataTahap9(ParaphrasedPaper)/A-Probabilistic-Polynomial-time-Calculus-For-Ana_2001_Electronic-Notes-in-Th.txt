Definition 2.4 introduces the concept of an oracle Turing machine, which is essentially a Turing machine augmented with an extra oracle tape and three additional states: qquery, qyes, and qno. When the machine enters the state qquery, if the contents on the oracle tape belong to the oracle set, control transitions to the state qyes; otherwise, it transitions to the state qno.

Definition 2.6 defines a poly-time oracle Turing machine as a probabilistic poly-time Turing machine that operates with a randomly chosen oracle from the space of oracles that can be queried within the time bound of the machine. Specifically, if m is an oracle machine running in time bounded by the polynomial q, and can only query the oracle with at most q(x) bits, then there exists a finite space of oracles running in time bounded by q.

Definition 2.16 states that a process expression p and a term t that is not within the scope of any input operator are termed as an exposed term. Similarly, if [t1= t2].r is a subexpression of p and does not appear in the scope of any input operator, it is referred to as an exposed match.

Definition 2.23 defines the binding of a process expression p by a channel cp(|n|) in another process expression q, where p is considered to be bound by cp(|n|) in q if cp(|n|)(x).d[p] is a sub-process of q for some variable x and some context expression d[].

Definition 2.24 clarifies that a context c[] is minimal for a process p if every free variable of p is bound in c[p], and each channel to which p is bound in c[p] binds a free variable of p.

The paper further discusses the evaluation process of exposed terms in a process expression, noting that each exposed term encountered by a probabilistic Turing machine is evaluated using an associated algorithm. The cost of evaluating the entire process expression on the probabilistic Turing machine is influenced by both the length of the expression and the costs of evaluating each exposed term encountered. Finally, the paper discusses the implications of security parameters in the context of defeating potential vulnerabilities in security systems.
