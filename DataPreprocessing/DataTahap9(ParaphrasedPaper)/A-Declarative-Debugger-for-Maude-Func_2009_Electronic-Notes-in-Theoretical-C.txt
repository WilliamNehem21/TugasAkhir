The work of e. y. shapiro serves as the foundation for the present study, which focuses on declarative debugging. Declarative debugging has seen extensive use across various programming languages, including logic, functional, and multiparadigm languages. This semi-automatic technique aims to identify the program fragment responsible for a user-identified error symptom, thus enabling the correction of the computation.

Before commencing the debugging process, users have the option to select a module containing only correct statements, which can serve as a reference for checking the correctness of inferences during the debugging process. By using this module as an oracle, the debugger can minimize the number of questions directed to the user.

Leveraging the reflective nature of rewriting logic, Maude exhibits a distinctive feature through its systematic and efficient use of reflection, facilitated by its predefined meta-level module. This allows for the generation and traversal of a debugging tree within a Maude computation using operations within Maude itself. Additionally, Maude provides the loop-mode module for specifying input/output interactions with the user, thus enabling the implementation of a declarative debugger for Maude functional modules and its user interactions within Maude itself.

The subsort relation's connected components are denoted using a specific format, and deductions in the calculus are represented as proof trees, with a focus on identifying buggy nodes—invalid nodes with all their children being valid—in the proof tree rooted at the initial error symptom. The goal is to identify a buggy node in any proof tree starting from the user-identified error symptom, through a process of questioning the user about the validity of nodes in the tree.

The study introduces the concept of abbreviated proof trees and outlines the assumptions regarding user-introduced modules. Various strategies for user interaction with the debugger are discussed, along with the associated commands for debugging and navigating the proof trees. The success of the debugging process is contingent upon the correctness of user responses to debugger queries.

In conclusion, the paper describes the implementation of a debugger for Maude functional modules using Maude's reflective capabilities, complementing existing debugging techniques for Maude. It emphasizes the essential role of correct user responses in effectively locating buggy statements during the debugging process.
