The cowpea (Vigna unguiculata [L.] Walp) is a long-standing source of protein for humans and has been cultivated as a crop since ancient times. It serves both as a food source and as a raw material for industrial products. Global production of dry cowpea seeds exceeds 8 million tons annually, with Africa and Asia accounting for 90% of the output. Despite America and Europe being the largest exporters of cowpea, they are among the lowest producers due to the inability of Asian and African countries to meet international export standards. This study aims to address this disparity by developing an automated device to detect and separate high-quality cowpea seeds in less developed producing countries.

The study utilized a constant sample weight of 2 kg in its evaluation experiments, representing 8.3% of the device's material carrying and processing capacity. Based on this information, the study inferred that the device can handle and process 24 kg (100% utilization) at a time.

An artificially intelligent quality separating device was created with three units: metering, automating, and belt conveying outlet. The device's separating efficiency, throughput, and maximum capacity were modeled and optimized for evaluation. It achieved an optimal impurity separating efficiency of 92%, impurity separating throughput of 2.689 kg/h, and maximum impurity separating capacity of 32.781 kg/12 h. The study also determined the effects of operating factors such as cowpea variety, export grades, and metering speed on the device's evaluation parameters. It was found that the device's metering speed should not exceed or fall below 20 rpm for optimal impurity separation results. This intelligent device can also be employed in the cowpea seeds grading processing line to attain export-grade quality.
