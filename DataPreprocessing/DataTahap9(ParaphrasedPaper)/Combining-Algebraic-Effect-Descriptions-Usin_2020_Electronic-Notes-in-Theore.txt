This paper's primary contribution lies in devising a general approach for amalgamating effects described by algebras constructed using local functions over effect operations. The approach utilizes the tensor product on complete lattices, as outlined in existing literature. This symmetric monoidal product inherently fuses differing notions of truth related to various effects. The paper demonstrates that the tensor product preserves the complete distributivity of complete lattices, which is instrumental in characterizing the structure of the tensor of complete lattices.

To exemplify, consider a program that flips a coin, yielding 3 on heads and 6 on tails. We aim to ascertain the extent to which this program generates an even number. We employ a predicate p associating a 0 probability of being even with 3 and a probability of 1 with 6. By combining these outcomes using the knowledge of a fair coin, the algebra determines that the program is expected to produce an even number half of the time.

The distinction between linearity and ilinearity arises due to a disparity between the requirements on the truth space "a" and how questions are addressed using an algebra. Linearity represents an inherent property of morphisms in "com," which encompasses our truth spaces, while the local functions constituting our algebras are ilinear but not linear in general (as illustrated in the forthcoming examples in subsection 3.2).

Another scenario involves a global store for storing natural numbers. In this case, the lookup operation possesses a countably infinite arity, and the set of states is denoted by "s = nloc," resembling the boolean store. For clarity, the paper focuses solely on the boolean store in subsequent discussions.

As seen in the examples in subsection 3.2, general local functions are ilinear rather than linear. For instance, "exppor(f[0,1], t[0,1]) = (0 + 1) / 2 = 0 = f[0,1]." Thus, a method for combining ilinear functions is essential. Fortunately, if all the implicated complete lattices are completely distributive, the bijection "f" outlined in (2) preserves ilinearity. This allows us to employ the same construction to combine ilinear functions.

To demonstrate the validity of interpretations of combinations of effects employing the aforementioned method, the paper examines several examples. Each case involves the addition of a specific effect to an arbitrary effect description. In subsection 7.1, the paper will delve into more specific combinations of effects.

In certain instances, additional axioms are necessary to describe the interaction between the desired effects we intend to combine. These axioms, incorporating effect operations from both theories, are referred to as interaction laws. The most prevalent interaction law is a commutativity law, as elucidated in existing literature.
