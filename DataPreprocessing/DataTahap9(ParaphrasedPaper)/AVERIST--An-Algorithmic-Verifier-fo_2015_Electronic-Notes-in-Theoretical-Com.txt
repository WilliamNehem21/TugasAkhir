The transition from x+ to y+ indicates a movement from the positive x-axis through quadrant 1 to the positive y-axis. Each edge is assigned a weight, representing the maximum scaling. For example, in the first quadrant, any path starting at a distance d from the origin on the positive x-axis will reach the positive y-axis at a distance of at most 2d from the origin, hence the weight on the corresponding edge is 2.

The first stage of quantitative predicate abstraction involves state-space partitioning, which takes a finite set of linear expressions and divides the state-space into distinct regions. The nodes of the abstract graph correspond to these regions.

The Averist tool is implemented in Python and utilizes several software packages. It uses the Parma Polyhedra Library (PPL) to represent the invariants and guards of the polyhedral switched system and to perform polyhedral operations in the state-space partition. The GNU Linear Programming Kit (GLPK) solver is employed to solve the optimization problems required for weight computation. Additionally, the NetworkX Python package is used to manage graphs and conduct graph analysis in the model-checking phase. These tools are integrated within the free open-source mathematics software system Sage.
