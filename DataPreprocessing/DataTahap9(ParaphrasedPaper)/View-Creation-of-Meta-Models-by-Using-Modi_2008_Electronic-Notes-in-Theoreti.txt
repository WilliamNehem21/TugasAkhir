The following section of this paper presents VTGGs and is organized as follows: Section 2 provides an example of two interconnected meta models, one of which acts as a view of the other. Section 3 briefly discusses existing research on constructing database views. Section 4 presents VTGGs, a modified version of TGGs used for specifying views. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper, addresses unresolved issues, and outlines potential future research directions. It should be noted that due to space limitations, a detailed explanation of the translation process from VTGG rules to view implementing graph transformation rules had to be omitted.

This particular subsection introduces the initial VTGG rule, which matches the empty axiom graph and generates the top-level object of the underlying model and its view. The application of a TGG rule to a pair of related model graphs is based on finding matches for all untagged elements of the rule. In the initial state of the derivation of a model and its view, there are no objects that could be matched by any pattern.
