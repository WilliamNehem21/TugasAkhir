In this academic paper, we outline the process of integrating a basic typed functional logic programming language into Haskell. This integration builds upon the Prolog embedding developed by Seres and Spivey, and requires the use of Haskell extensions for quantified types and the ST-monad in order to achieve complete static typing.
