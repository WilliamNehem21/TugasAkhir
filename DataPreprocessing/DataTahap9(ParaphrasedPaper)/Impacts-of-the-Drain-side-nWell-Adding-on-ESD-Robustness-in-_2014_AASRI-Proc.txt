In recent years, the widespread adoption of silicon technology in personal computers, laptops, mobile phones, the internet, digital cameras, and other applications has been facilitated by advances and scaling in microelectronic technologies. However, the increasing prevalence of electrostatic discharge (ESD) events has raised concerns about the reliability of integrated circuits (ICs). This is attributed to the scaling of integrated circuits, resulting in a thinner gate oxide layer, shallower junction depths in source/drain regions, and smaller contact window sizes. As a result, the susceptibility of integrated circuits to ESD damage has escalated rapidly, making ESD reliability increasingly crucial for ultra-deep submicron or nano-scale electronic products.

The damage caused by ESD to integrated circuits is largely due to the large current and residual heat produced by ESD events. ESD events in the human body model (HBM) can generate transient power with rising times on the nanosecond scale and voltages reaching kilovolts. This transient power can lead to high temperatures in small areas of drain-depleted high-resistance regions of metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs). The resulting heat can cause spiking in the aluminum or via-plug material of contact windows, leading to alloy formation with the silicon substrate and disappearance of the p/n junction of semiconductor devices. This can result in short and abnormal electrical junction performance. Spiking phenomena are more likely to occur in the drain or source side of the p/n junction, particularly in the case of drain reverse bias, due to the highest resistance in this area, which leads to high temperatures and spiking.
