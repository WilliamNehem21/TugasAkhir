In this module, the negation of a structure is denoted by a specific representation. Rather than using parentheses for conjunction, which can lead to ambiguities due to their common use in meta-level programming and other contexts in Maude, we utilize the syntax {_,_}. Information about the associativity and commutativity of the structures and their units is conveyed through operator attributes, such as [assoc comm id: ff] for disjunction.

The module utilizes the aforementioned ksg-signature module. It is important to note that the rules of system ksg are expressed as bottom-up proof search term rewriting rules. In the calculus of structures, inference rules can only be applied within contexts that are not under the scope of negation. To prevent the application of the rule weakening to negative atoms, the module includes two rules for weakening. This approach, leveraging pattern matching, helps to avoid unsound operations.

The "op o:-> unit" rule, which duplicates arbitrary substructures, increases the search space rapidly. Therefore, the application of this rule must be controlled. We will address this issue in conjunction with proof theoretical ideas aimed at reducing nondeterminism in proof search.

In the implementation described, different phases of the proof, which involve different sets of inference rules, are represented by functional modules called by the operator "prove" of the functional module ksg-strat. Functionally, the "prove" operator first converts the object-level representation of the input query term to a Maude meta-level representation of the same term with respect to the ksg-signature module. Subsequently, the meta-level term corresponding to the negation normal form of the input term is computed through the operation "metareduce," taking the meta-representation of the functional module ksg-unf as an argument. Lastly, the computed meta-level terms are passed to the meta-level representations of the functional modules "distribute," "interaction," and "weakening," which reduce these meta-level terms in accordance with their respective rules.
