It is common to consider enumeration problems for hypergraphs. One might anticipate that these problems become significantly more challenging, as is often the case when graph problems are extended to hypergraphs. This holds true for the problem of determining an asymptotic formula for the count of connected r-uniform hypergraphs with a specified number of vertices and edges (refer to [5, 1, 4, 3]).
