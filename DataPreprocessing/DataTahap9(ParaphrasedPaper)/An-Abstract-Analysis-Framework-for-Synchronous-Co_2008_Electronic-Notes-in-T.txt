A variety of concurrent programming languages have been developed over time, stemming from different programming traditions and exhibiting differences in several aspects. However, they all share the common goal of enabling programmers to harness parallelism. To support programming with multiple processes, fundamental concurrency primitives are often combined to form the main language constructs, incorporating different assumptions. This paper conducts an analysis of the predominant primitives and associated semantics in the category of synchronous concurrent programming languages, which feature a global mechanism for process synchronization. Subsequently, a general framework is presented for approximating the semantics of these primary constructs, applicable to both declarative and imperative concurrent programming languages. The paper establishes conditions that ensure the accuracy of the approximation, thus enabling the resulting abstract semantics to effectively support program analysis and verification.

Concurrent programming languages incorporate language constructs for managing concurrency, with two primary approaches: synchronous and asynchronous models. Asynchronous models operate under the assumption that concurrently running system components proceed at varying rates.

Attaining an effective approximation of semantics through abstract interpretation necessitates making informed language-specific decisions, particularly concerning the abstraction of domains and basic actions. The subsequent section details how operators can generally be abstracted, with the accuracy of these abstractions directly influencing the extent of non-real traces added to the abstract model.

The paper also delves into the abstraction of critical actions, particularly those that can cause execution to suspend, such as the global choice action. Furthermore, it highlights the necessity of handling the conditional operator with precision, emphasizing that abstraction of the conditional operator without altering the time notion of the source language is only feasible if the language being abstracted features an instantaneous choice operator. This aspect is clarified in the ensuing discussion.
