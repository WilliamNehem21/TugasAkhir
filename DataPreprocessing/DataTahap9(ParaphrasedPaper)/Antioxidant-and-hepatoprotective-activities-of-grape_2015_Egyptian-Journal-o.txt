The primary objective of this study was to investigate the antioxidant properties of grape seed and skin (GSE and GSK) in countering oxidative stress, hepatic dysfunction, and liver pathology induced by Ehrlich solid tumor (EST) in albino mice. GSE and GSK were added to the standard diet and administered to mice for 44 days, starting 14 days prior to tumor cell inoculation and continuing for 30 days thereafter. The results showed that mice with EST exhibited elevated levels of plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), increased lipid peroxidation, decreased glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) levels in both blood and liver, as well as liver pathology indicative of hepatic degeneration. Conversely, supplementation with GSE and GSK in EST-bearing mice led to a reduction in liver function enzyme levels, decreased lipid peroxidation, increased antioxidant parameters, normalized liver protein and DNA contents, and ameliorated histopathological hepatic lesions. In conclusion, GSE and GSK possess potent antioxidant properties that bolster the antioxidant defense system, consequently protecting the liver from EST-induced oxidative stress.

Grape components, primarily found in the skin and seeds, such as flavonoids, polyphenols, anthocyanins, proanthocyanidins, procyanidins, and resveratrol, are known for their antioxidant, anticancer, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory activities.

Our preliminary investigations suggest that GSE and GSK intake significantly reduces tumor growth in Ehrlich carcinoma-bearing animals. However, the impact of GSE and GSK intake on lipid peroxidation and antioxidant status in the liver in the context of tumor-bearing animals is an understudied area.

The experiment involved four groups of animals, including an untreated control group, a group receiving only GSE and GSK treatment, and a group with EST-bearing mice receiving GSE and GSK. Various parameters such as enzyme activities and oxidative stress markers were measured to assess the impact of GSE and GSK supplementation.

The findings revealed that EST-bearing mice exhibited liver dysfunction, as indicated by elevated ALT and AST levels, as well as increased lipid peroxidation. Furthermore, GSH content and antioxidant enzyme activities were depleted in the blood and liver, concurrent with the increase in lipid peroxidation. Conversely, GSE and GSK supplementation in EST-bearing mice led to improved liver function, reduced lipid peroxidation, and restored antioxidant status.

Moreover, histological and ultrastructural examination of the liver tissues of EST-bearing mice showed hepatic degeneration, inflammation, and an increase in collagen fibers. However, the administration of GSE and GSK led to noticeable improvements in hepatic histopathology and ultrastructure, suggesting a protective effect against liver injury.

Furthermore, GSE and GSK supplementation in EST-bearing mice reduced collagen deposition and mitigated the decrease in protein and DNA contents in the liver tissue, indicating an additional protective effect against oxidant-induced liver injury.

In summary, the results of this study support the potential use of GSE and GSK as protective agents against oxidative stress-induced liver damage in the context of EST, possibly due to their strong antioxidant activities.
