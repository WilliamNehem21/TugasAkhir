This examines how the output changes in relation to the input content. For example, it can be used to monitor the speed at which a self-map converges to a fixed point and to determine whether a fixed point functions as a local attractor. These concepts have been applied to analyze algorithm complexity and to locate fixed points and zeros of functions.
