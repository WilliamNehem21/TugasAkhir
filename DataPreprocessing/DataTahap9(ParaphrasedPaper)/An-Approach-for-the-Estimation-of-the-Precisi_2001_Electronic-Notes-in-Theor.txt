In this paper, we address the issue of recovering the set of real objects generated by rigid transformations of a given discretized object in R2, while maintaining the fixed discretization as a set of Zn. This problem arises in the context of medical imaging, specifically in cancer therapy, where the goal is to irradiate a tumor using dosimetry techniques to determine the necessary beam energy level for maximal tumor damage. To achieve beam concentration on the tumor, multi-leaves collimators are used to deform the beam into a shape resembling the tumor.

We propose utilizing a previously developed algorithm to address this problem. Specifically, we apply the same transformations to the object's borders, denoted as the transformation "t." For each border [si, s(i+1)%n] of the initial polygon, we compute the feasible region ri and its parameters after the transformation t. The transformed borders correspond to points (ai, bi) in the parameter space of a-b. The validity of transformation t depends on whether each point (ai, bi) lies within ri.

A potential extension of this work is to generalize the results to encompass general curves. One approach to achieve this is to approximate the curve's interior and exterior using two polygonal lines. Additionally, we may consider extending the study to 3D real objects, specifically polyhedral ones.
