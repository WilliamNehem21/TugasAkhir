This academic paper discusses how regional financial risk is influenced not only by external factors, but also by specific economic environments and market structures within a given area. Additionally, it highlights the impact of imbalanced regional economic and financial development on the distinctive regional characteristics of financial risk, as well as the weaker local resistance to regional financial turmoil leading to potential crises.

The study's regression analysis reveals that factors such as GDP growth, real estate price index, broad money growth, credit balance, and balance of international trade have a positive influence on financial stress, while variables like the price of crude oil rate of change, sum GDP, the ratio of broad money to GDP, the one-year deposit spreads between China and the United States, and Japanese GDP growth have a negative influence. It is noted that collinearity among explanatory variables may not accurately reflect the actual situation, but this does not affect the overall predictive capability of the explanatory variables for the overall financial stress index (CFSI).

Building upon the work of Illing and Liu (2003), this paper employs a financial stress index (FSI) as a measure of financial risk, and constructs an early-warning model for the FSI using empirical methods that incorporate explanatory variables and lagging indicators. The study finds that explanatory variables lagging four quarters (with two variables lagging six and eight quarters) can effectively predict future financial stress exponents based on known current conditions.
