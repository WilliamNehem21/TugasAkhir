The original intention for introducing the interaction combinators was to create a universal interaction net system, capable of simulating all other interaction net systems. The simplicity, elegance, and universality of the combinators, which automatically make them Turing-complete, justify studying them as an independent computational model, separate from their relationship to general interaction nets.

Wires within the system may have one or both ends unconnected to any cell, resulting in the existence of free ports in the net. These ports can be principal or auxiliary, and the net's interface is defined by its free ports.

Readers familiar with the geometry of interaction (GOI) may recognize that well-foundedness is a more stringent condition than nilpotency. In GOI semantics, only straight paths with non-null weights in the dynamic algebra, or regular paths in Danos-Regnier terminology, are considered. It can be demonstrated that well-foundedness, expressed in terms of maximal regular paths or the finiteness of regular paths, becomes a necessary condition for a net to be total, thus characterizing total nets by nilpotency.
