The aim of this research was to create, produce, and evaluate the antipsychotic properties of a series of new derivatives, namely (5-(10-(3-N, N-dimethylamino) propyl)-10H-phenothiazine-3-yl)-1,3,4-thiadiazole-2-yl) azo-dye/schiff base/chalcone compounds. The newly formed compound structures were identified using FT-IR, 1H NMR, mass spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. Each compound exhibited notable antipsychotic activity in a haloperidol-induced catalepsy metallic bar test, with findings consistent with the docking study. Among the synthesized derivatives, compound GC8 demonstrated high potency in inducing catalepsy and was considered to be a potent antipsychotic agent among the synthesized compounds.

For the synthesis, 4-chlorobenzene amine, p-chloroacetophenone, potassium carbonate, and copper wire were dissolved in 30 ml of DMF in a 250 ml round bottom flask. Similarly, 1-(4-(4(chlorobenzeneamino) phenyl) ethanone was dissolved in rectified spirit, with sulfur and iodine, and subjected to reflux to obtain 1-(7-chloro-10H-phenothiazine-3-yl) ethanone.

Animal testing was conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the animal ethics committee at Giet School of Pharmacy in Rajahmundry, India. The compound GC8 showed the highest catalepsy induction at various time intervals and significantly reduced the level of normal dopamine, similar to haloperidol-treated animals.

The synthesis of the compounds involved the interaction between 5-(10-(3-(N,N-dimethylamino) propyl-10H-phenothiazine-3-yl)-1,3,4-thiadiazole-2-amine, sodium nitrite, con. HCl, and various coupling reagents. Schiff base derivatives were obtained through the condensation of 5-(10-(3-(N,N-dimethylamino) propyl-10H-phenothiazine-3-yl)-1,3,4-thiadiazole-2-amine and different aromatic aldehydes, while chalcone derivatives were prepared using the Claisen-Schmidt condensation reaction.
