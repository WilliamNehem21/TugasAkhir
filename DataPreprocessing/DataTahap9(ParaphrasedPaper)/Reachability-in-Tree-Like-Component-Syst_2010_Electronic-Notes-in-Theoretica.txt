In component-based modeling techniques, the global state space of a system grows exponentially with the number of components, leading to the problem of state space explosion. This makes it inefficient to check properties of a component-based system by exploring its state space. Therefore, we examine the complexity classification of reachability. 

Interaction systems are a type of component-based formalism where a system consists of components connected by glue-code. They are structured in two layers, with the interaction model describing component interfaces and the glue-code, and the second layer defining component behavior using labeled transition systems.

A significant class of component-based systems is characterized by a tree-like communication structure, which includes hierarchical and master-slave operator networks. This class has been extensively studied due to its relevance to various systems.

We demonstrate that reachability in tree-like interaction systems is PSPACE-complete, showing its hardness by reducing it from QBF. The PSPACE-hardness of reachability in general interaction systems was previously established through a reduction from reachability in 1-safe Petri nets, which, in turn, was shown to be PSPACE-hard by reducing it from QBF.

We assume a QBF formula is formed using a specific grammar, where the language TQBF consists of true QBF instances and is known to be PSPACE-complete.

The local behavior of components is represented by labeled transition systems, with each system having states labeled 't' and 'f' to signify the assignment of true or false. The initial state is indicated by an ingoing arrow.

By modifying the previous reduction, we can prove the PSPACE-completeness of the progress property in tree-like interaction systems. We introduce definitions for progress in interaction systems and provide an overview of why deciding this property in tree-like interaction systems is PSPACE-complete. In general, progress in interaction systems is PSPACE-complete, thus showing that progress in tree-like interaction systems also falls within PSPACE.

It is evident that the 'evaluated true' connector is the only one enabled when the state 'qt' is reached. In this case, 'evaluated true' will occur infinitely often, allowing the component ‘pro’ to progress as long as 'h' is true.

We examine the complexity of component-based systems by proving the PSPACE-completeness of reachability in 1-safe Petri nets and using this result to demonstrate the PSPACE-completeness of the reachability problem in component-based systems, particularly focusing on tree-like systems.
