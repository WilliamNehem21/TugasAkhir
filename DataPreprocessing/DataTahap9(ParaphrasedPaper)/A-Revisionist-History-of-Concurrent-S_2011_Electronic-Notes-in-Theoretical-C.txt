The ability to be proven. The first case would require an intermediate condition involving either x or a, so a1 must contain x or a. However, c2 affects both of these variables, causing the side condition for the parallel rule to fail.

As is typical, the validity of the inference rules stems from their ability to preserve validity: for all properly formed instances of each inference rule, if the premises are valid and the side conditions are met, then the conclusion is valid. The proof involves a detailed analysis of each rule, largely following existing methods but with the incorporation and manipulation of rely sets. We outline the key steps in demonstrating the soundness of the parallel rule and the rule addressing local resources.
