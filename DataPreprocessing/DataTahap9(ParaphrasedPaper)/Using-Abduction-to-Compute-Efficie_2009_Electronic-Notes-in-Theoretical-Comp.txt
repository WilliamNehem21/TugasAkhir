In an academic paper, the author discussed the structure of a branch, which consists of elements t a1,...,tan,fb1,...,fbm. The paper also explained that a branch expansion can occur when the premises of an expansion rule are present in the branch, leading to the addition of the rule's conclusions at the end of the branch. Additionally, the paper mentioned the PB branching rule, which divides a branch into two separate branches.
