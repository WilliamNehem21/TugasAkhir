The paper discusses the generation of metamodels for programming languages defined by a grammar and proposes a framework to create a compiler for reading programs and producing models conforming to the generated metamodel. It highlights the limitations of current textual languages in missing a complete metamodel, making it difficult for model-based software development tools to process programs written in those languages. 

The proposed framework offers a solution to generate metamodels for programming languages defined by a grammar. It utilizes a predefined set of annotations directly written into the grammar to adjust the generation of the metamodel, making the generated model more suitable for specific applications. 

The paper further discusses related works, defines a quality measurement for the proposed framework, presents the current implementation, and summarizes the content. It also contrasts its framework with a previously described approach, highlighting differences in detail and opinions on solving specific tasks and adding additional information to improve the metamodel.

The authors stress the importance of defining applications for metamodels to measure their quality, emphasizing the need for metamodels to represent the semantics of the language and not just the syntax.

Additionally, the paper discusses the removal of identifiers from metamodels, the use of MOF 2 repositories, and the potential of the proposed framework to migrate programs written in textual languages into the field of modeling, making them accessible for model-based tools for software development.
