This reduction process can be straightforwardly broken down into two distinct steps: one involving the computation of the substitution, and the other entailing the description of the application of the corresponding substitution. It is important to note that this breakdown does not imply that the matching computations leading from constraints to substitutions and the application of the substitution are explicitly laid out, but rather that they are clearly distinct. Depending on the matching theory, these computations can be very significant, and we aim to delve deeper into this issue and explicitly define them.

The application of a rewrite system is not as straightforward as described above. In the case presented, we encode a single (meta) rewriting step, but in general, encoding is more complex because it necessitates the encoding of the evaluation strategy. The use of (typed) fixpoints is employed to address this issue, allowing for the recursive application of the rewrite system (refer to a complete presentation for more details).
