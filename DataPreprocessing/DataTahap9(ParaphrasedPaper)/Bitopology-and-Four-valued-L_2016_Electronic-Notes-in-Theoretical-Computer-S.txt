The paper discusses bilattices and d-frames, which are structures with a four-valued interpretation. While d-frames were initially introduced with topological semantics in mind, bilattice theory is closely connected with logic. The authors propose a common generalization of both structures that retains clear bitopological semantics while preserving much of the original logic of bilattices. Additionally, the authors introduce a new bitopological interpretation for the connectives of four-valued logic.

Jung and Moshier later studied bitopological spaces, also known as bispaces, to elucidate the interplay of various topologies arising in domain theory. They discovered that bispaces provide a natural semantics for four-valued logic, where one topology represents observably true predicates and the other represents observably false ones. This interpretation becomes more transparent in the algebraic duals of bispaces, termed d-frames.

The paper aims to address the question of whether there exists a reasonable generalization of both bilattice and d-frame theories that would provide better insight into their similarities and differences. The authors propose a new structure called nd-frames, which extends d-frames and maintains clear bitopological semantics while still preserving most of the original logic of bilattices. Furthermore, the authors demonstrate that negation in four-valued logic in the context of nd-frames has a new and clear bitopological realization via interior operators.

The paper makes significant contributions to the study of both bilattices and d-frames. It generalizes bilattices to create four-valued structures where the components are not isomorphic, and it offers an explanation of proof-theoretic negation in d-frames while extending this negation to the entire d-frame. The authors also demonstrate a connection between geometry (interior operators) and proof theory (cut rules) and show that nd-frames allow a finer distinction of bispaces compared to d-frames. The generalization of both structures enables a comparison of partial implication in d-frames with the implication of bilattices, indicating that the former is much stronger than the latter.

The authors note that extending Stone duality for d-frames to nd-frames is straightforward, suggesting the robustness of the theory. They add specific conditions to the d-frame duality to accommodate the generalization. Similarly, in the characterization of spatial nd-frames, additional conditions are necessary beyond those for spatial d-frames.
