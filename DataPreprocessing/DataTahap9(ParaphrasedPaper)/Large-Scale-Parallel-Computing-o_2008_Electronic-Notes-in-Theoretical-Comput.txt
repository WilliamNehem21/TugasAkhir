This research paper contends that computational grids have the potential to support a wider range of applications beyond simple parallel processing tasks. It suggests that algorithmic optimizations such as latency-hiding and exploiting local resources can enable high performance on grids, despite the relatively slow wide-area networks connecting the grid resources. The increasing bandwidth of wide-area networks is making it possible for even highly communication-intensive applications to run on grids, provided the underlying algorithms can tolerate latency.

The paper demonstrates large-scale parallel computing on grids through three example applicationsâ€”transposition-driven search, retrograde analysis, and model checking, providing performance results from the DAS-3 computer science grid with dedicated optical network.

Furthermore, the paper delves into the optimization of algorithms and applications to function effectively in this environment, focusing on applications that search large state spaces. It discusses how heuristic search algorithms can be optimized to run on a grid and presents a case study of implementing a retrograde analysis application for solving the game of awari on the DAS-3 grid. The paper also explores the use of the Divine model checking toolkit on the DAS-3 system.

The DAS-3 system is highlighted as a representative of future grid systems due to its hierarchical structure with both fast local interconnect and higher-latency wide-area interconnect, along with high bandwidth. The paper details discussions on designing parallel applications for such systems, referred to as distributed supercomputing applications, and emphasizes the advantages of using DAS systems for controlled experiments in studying wide-area parallel algorithms.

The feasibility of optimizing applications to mitigate the high latency of wide-area networks is emphasized, with the key concept being latency tolerance. The paper further describes an asynchronous heuristic search algorithm that effectively hides network latency by overlapping communication and computation, taking advantage of modern high-speed networks.

In addition, the paper discusses the implementation of a retrograde analysis program for solving the game of awari on the DAS-3 system, addressing communication efficiency with the use of light path technology. It also explores the performance analysis of the Divine model checking toolkit on the DAS-3 system, highlighting the similarities in performance characteristics with retrograde analysis applications.

The paper concludes by stressing the importance of further research into optimizing distributed model checkers and developing programming environments that simplify the programming and deployment of grid applications, as part of ongoing research on IBIS.
