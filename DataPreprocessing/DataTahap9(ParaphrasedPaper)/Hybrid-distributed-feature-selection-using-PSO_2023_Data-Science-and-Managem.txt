Feature selection is an important part of data preprocessing, aimed at narrowing down the set of features to those that are informative, relevant, and non-redundant. After studying various feature selection techniques, it was observed that many wrapper-based methods ignore feature redundancy, while filter-based methods tend to select features with some redundancy. Additionally, wrapper techniques are computationally expensive and selecting an optimal subset of features from a high-dimensional dataset is a challenge for machine learning researchers. To address these issues, a hybrid feature selection method called hdfs(pso-mi) was developed, which combines particle swarm optimization (PSO) and mutual information (MI). The PSO optimization is applied to select optimal features from each distribution of a distributed dataset, and the solutions from all distributions are combined using MI to obtain the best subset of features. This hybrid model integrates both filter and wrapper methods, with the wrapper method being executed in a distributed and parallel manner to reduce computational costs.

This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses related studies and existing feature selection methods, Section 3 describes the PSO algorithm, Section 4 presents the proposed hdfs(pso-mi) method and its corresponding algorithm with a working example, and the experimental results and analysis are provided in a subsequent section.

The use of multiple objective functions for effective analysis of features in different data distributions is highlighted, with the accuracy value obtained from the SVM classifier playing a significant role in feature selection. The proposed hybrid method, while effective, has the disadvantage of taking exponential time on large datasets to evaluate features using multiple objective functions.

The hdfs(pso-mi) method is described as an efficient hybrid feature selection approach that demonstrates high effectiveness in selecting an optimal subset of features for achieving high classification accuracy on diverse datasets. The method's ability to address the class imbalance problem is noted, as the selected features provide high classification accuracy across various datasets. The hybrid method is shown to significantly reduce the dimensions and redundancies of high-dimensional datasets and outperform existing filter-based feature selection methods. However, it is acknowledged that the proposed objective function increases the computational cost compared to the two existing objective functions used in the hdfs(pso-mi) method.
