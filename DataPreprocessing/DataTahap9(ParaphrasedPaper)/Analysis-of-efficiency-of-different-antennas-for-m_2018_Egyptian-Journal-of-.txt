The study involved using antennas powered by 50 watts for durations of 5 and 10 minutes to determine ablation diameters, ablation lengths, and aspect ratios. Among the tested antennas, the sleeved antenna exhibited the lowest reflection coefficient, high power dissipation, low power dissipation density, high specific absorption rate (SAR), and high temperature in simulation. In addition, the sleeved antenna offered excellent localization, a larger ablative diameter, lower backward heating, and a higher aspect ratio compared to single slot, dual slot, and monopole antennas.

The materials utilized in this research included the COMSOL Multiphysics software version 4.4 (Stockholm, Sweden), a 2.45 GHz solid-state microwave generator (Sairem SAS 200 W, Neyron Cedex, France), semi-rigid coaxial cable (RG405 Coax, Pasternack Enterprises Inc, Los Angeles), excised bovine liver, Teflon tape, and ImageJ software (NIH) for image analysis.

To explore the differences in ablation diameters, ablation lengths, and aspect ratios among the four types of antennas, ANOVA was conducted using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). A p-value of less than .05 was considered statistically significant. Additionally, the percentage differences in ablation coagulation diameter and length between the antennas were compared with the monopole antenna.
