During the early 1990s, the concept of a final f-coalgebra for a functor f on a category c gained prominence for the abstract representation of potentially infinite objects in computer science. This concept was particularly useful for modeling datatypes like infinite streams and dynamic systems such as processes or automata. By treating these diverse entities uniformly as behavioral systems of some type f, it became possible to abstractly formulate definition and proof principles that had previously been studied separately for different applications.

The theory presented in this paper is defined for a general category c, but for clarity, our explanations and examples are all based on the category of sets and total functions, denoted as Set. This paper is a condensed version of a CWI technical report with the same title. The full report contains detailed proofs for most of the statements presented here, along with additional examples.

With this approach, one can directly work with the relation b as in equation (2), which only includes the pairs used in the statement itself. There is no need to construct a description that encompasses all encountered tails while traversing the streams, as was done by Rutten (2000a), who utilized all pairs.

We have deferred the search for further interesting applications of our framework to future work. Since we have identified sufficient conditions for our schema to operate without assuming that the functor t is a pointed functor or monad, it would be particularly rewarding to discover examples that exploit this generality. In all the examples explored so far, this structure can be readily incorporated, or at least after a straightforward reformulation of the problem.

I extend my gratitude to my colleagues, particularly Jan Rutten, Alexandru Baltag, and Alexander Kurz, for their discussions and guidance. I also thank Dirk Pattinson for his suggestions and the anonymous referees for their helpful comments. Special thanks are owed to Matteo Coccia, whose interest in category theory during his time at CWI sparked my own interest.
