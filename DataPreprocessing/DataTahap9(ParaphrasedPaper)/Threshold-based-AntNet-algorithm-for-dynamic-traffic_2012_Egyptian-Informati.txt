Most current research and applications of ant routing algorithms focus on determining optimal routes in data communication networks. However, their use in dynamic routing on road networks is still relatively limited. Dynamic routing algorithms are important for directing road traffic to avoid congestion and guide vehicles to more efficient routes. An Ant-Based Control (ABC) algorithm has been employed for routing road traffic within a city, and a City-Based Parking Routing System (CBPRS) utilizing ant-based routing has been proposed. Additionally, a modified version of the ABC algorithm and AntNet has been introduced for routing vehicle drivers using historical traffic information. Furthermore, a variant of the AntNet algorithm has been applied to enhance travel time over road traffic networks and divert traffic from congested routes.

To improve algorithm performance and reduce computation, the connectivity among different nodes is exploited, facilitating efficient exploration of network routes and rapid adaptation to changes in road conditions. A software agent known as "check ants" has been utilized to monitor and retain good routes while rejecting deteriorated ones.

The paper introduces the standard AntNet algorithm in section 2, and presents a modified version in section 3, followed by a simulation experiment in section 4 and concluding remarks in section 5. The algorithm employs g(0, 1] to weigh the influence of recent samples on travel time, and utilizes a moving observation window (wd) of size wmax to store trip times of the last wmax ants. The proposed algorithm also incorporates threshold values for travel times between network nodes, which serve as benchmarks for good travel times. Leveraging these rules in the AntNet algorithm reduces computation, leading to better utilization of computing power and improved adaptation to dynamic road conditions.

While the theoretical worst-case efficiency of the threshold algorithm for a network of n nodes is O(n2), the processing time for a discovered route decreases to a constant value dependent only on the number of nodes in the route. This performance persists until the route becomes degraded, allowing for rapid coverage of network changes. The proposed algorithm shows improved convergence to optimal routes and better conservation of good routes compared to the standard AntNet algorithm, even in a parallel processing environment.

In summary, the proposed enhancement to the threshold-based AntNet algorithm provides significant performance gains by reducing computational burden, enabling efficient route discovery and monitoring, and effectively adapting to dynamic changes in road conditions.
