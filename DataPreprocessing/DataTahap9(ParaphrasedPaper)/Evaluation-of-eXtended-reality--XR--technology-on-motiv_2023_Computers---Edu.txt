Over the past decade, the Mexican education system has encountered numerous challenges, prompting a call for reforms to enhance the quality of education. In line with the criteria set by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Mexico has been gradually incorporating a competency-based educational (CBE) model into its educational institutions since 2004. According to the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), the CBE model is geared towards meeting the standards set by the OECD. Recognizing the need to address motivation for STEM education in Mexico, the present study was designed to assess the impact of XR (extended reality) technology, specifically augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), on the motivation and learning performance of students in a physics course. The study aimed to showcase the visual and interactive capabilities of XR technology and its potential to support students in a subject traditionally perceived as challenging. The study utilized a web-based XR learning application that delivers learning content in virtual environments for both AR and VR technologies, accessible on various devices. As interest in immersive XR technologies for STEM education grows, recent research has provided comprehensive evidence of their effectiveness. Previous studies have demonstrated that AR and VR strategies can enhance learning outcomes and motivation in STEM fields.

A study by Johnson-Glenberg et al. (2021) examined the effects of embodied learning in STEM experiences, revealing that the level of immersion and interactivity significantly influenced the learning experience. Lee et al. (2022) investigated the use of XR classroom setups for STEM education, reporting positive outcomes in terms of collaborative, interactive, and immersive learning experiences. Similarly, Smith et al. (2023) presented a VR plotting system for STEM education, while Alkhabra et al. (2023) explored the use of AR to enhance learning retention and critical thinking skills in high school students. Despite the positive impact of XR integration in STEM curricula, challenges such as device availability, teacher training, and the development of digital learning content hinder its widespread adoption. Nevertheless, recent efforts have been made to introduce XR technologies into the Mexican school curriculum.

The current study aimed to fill the gap in the literature by investigating the motivational effects of using XR technologies among Mexican university-level students compared to traditional teaching methods. The research design involved the implementation of two distinct XR approaches, AR and VR, to assess the overall student experience and perception of the learning applications. The study utilized a web-based XR learning application, called PhysXR, which presents interactive experiences in AR and VR environments, focusing on experiments related to physical phenomena. The study involved two sessions, where students in different groups (control, AR, VR) engaged with learning content through PhysXR. Statistical analyses revealed that students using AR capabilities demonstrated the highest increase in learning gains, with the AR and VR groups showing superior learning gains compared to the control group. The study emphasized the importance of experiential learning and the role of XR technologies in stimulating motivation for learning. Additionally, the study highlighted the potential of AR for mobile devices and the implementation of virtual environments for desktop devices, acknowledging the limitations in terms of internet connectivity, hardware compatibility, and content coverage.

In conclusion, the study validated the positive impact of XR implementations, particularly AR, in the Mexican educational context, specifically in the field of Newtonian mechanics. The findings showcased the potential of XR technologies to enhance self-learning skills and improve understanding of mathematical abstractions in physics. However, the study also acknowledged limitations related to internet connectivity, hardware compatibility, and content coverage, which need to be addressed for effective implementation of XR technologies in education.
