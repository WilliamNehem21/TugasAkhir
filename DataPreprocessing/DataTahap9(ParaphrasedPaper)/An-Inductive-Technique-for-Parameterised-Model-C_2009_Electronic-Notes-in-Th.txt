We introduce a method for addressing the parameterised probabilistic model checking problem in the context of randomised distributed systems modelled as Markov decision processes. Specifically, we focus on a class of systems, referred to as degenerative systems, which exhibit the property that a system model with a certain communication graph will eventually exhibit similar behavior to a model with a reduced graph. We outline an induction schema for reasoning about degenerative system models across arbitrary graphs, demonstrating that a specific class of quantitative LTL properties will hold for a system model with any communication graph if it holds for all models with a certain base graph. To illustrate our approach, we present a case study involving the IEEE 1394 (Firewire) Tree Identify Protocol (TIP), which is designed to elect a leader in an acyclic network of processes. Our technique is designed for degenerative protocols, which are commonly found in distributed systems, and we demonstrate its application to the TIP, showing that a set of properties true for systems with a star topology will hold for systems with any acyclic topology. We also discuss the challenges associated with degenerative probabilistic protocols and ongoing efforts to extend the induction schema to address these challenges.
