The sounds produced by the heart contain valuable information regarding the functioning of the heart valves and blood flow dynamics. Detecting heart valve disorders through visual examination or listening to these sounds requires considerable expertise and experience. The presence of abnormal sounds, known as murmurs, is often indicative of heart valve pathology. Therefore, identifying murmurs in cardiac sound signals is a crucial aspect of diagnosing heart valve disorders.

In this research, the probability density function of reconstructed murmurs is calculated for discrete signal amplitudes using a histogram technique. The range of signal amplitudes is divided into m bins, with the ratio m to n being maintained at a constant value of 0.01 in this study. This method allows for the estimation of the probability of a signal having a specific amplitude within the given range.
