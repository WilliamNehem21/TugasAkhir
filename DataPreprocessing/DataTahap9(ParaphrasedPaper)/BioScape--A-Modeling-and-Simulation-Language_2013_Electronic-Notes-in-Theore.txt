We have developed bioscape, a concurrent language specifically designed for stochastic simulations of biological and bio-material processes in a reactive 3D environment. Bioscape is based on the stochastic pi-calculus and is aimed at meeting the requirements for simulating individual-based, continuous motion, and continuous space processes in modeling complex interactions between bacteria and materials. Our primary application scenario is a bio-triggered drug delivery system for infection-resistant medical implants. The models constructed in bioscape will assist in identifying relevant biological targets and material strategies for treating bacterial infections associated with biomaterials.

While there is now a comprehensive understanding of the interactions between tissue cells and biomaterial surfaces, much less is known about the impact of surface properties on interactions with bacteria. Nevertheless, these interactions are crucial, as biomaterials-associated infections (BAI) represent a significant clinical challenge. Current approaches to addressing BAI focus on engineering antimicrobial or antifouling coatings for specific biomedical devices.

Bioscape includes the standard reaction operations send, receive, and delay, as well as the geometric operation move, which can be extended to any affine transformation. Unlike reaction operations, the move operation is always enabled. To prevent unfair competition between reactions and geometric operations, we have split the semantics into two reduction relations and incorporated a heterogeneous choice operator with probabilistic and non-deterministic branches.

The language defines the characteristics of bacteria, including their movement space, movement step, and shape. Bacteria can move within their designated movement space, taking random steps of a defined length, and their shape is always contained within this space. The delay@1.0.(bac()| bac()) represents the division of a bacterium into two daughter cells, and the delay@1.0 prefix models the non-instantaneous nature of this reaction.

The issue of overcrowding is not addressed in this paper, but there are potential approaches to handle it. Cells possess external regulators that enable them to respond to molecules from neighboring cells and emit signals to inhibit mitosis in overcrowded conditions. If relevant to the system being modeled, addressing overcrowding in the model would be the most natural approach. Alternatively, the modeling language could implement other methods to address overcrowding, such as disabling reactions exacerbating overcrowding if enough movement steps fail within a given area.

The process calculus that bears the closest resemblance to bioscape is the shape calculus, a CCS-like timed calculus with a simulating tool called bioshape. However, there are several notable differences between the two. Bioscape is stochastic, while the shape calculus is not. Bioscape allows for the dynamic creation of channels, whereas the shape calculus does not. Additionally, bioscape permits agents to be modified by affine transformations, which is useful for modeling phenomena such as cell growth, while the shape calculus only allows movement specified with a velocity vector. These differences make bioscape well-suited for modeling the behavior of biomaterials and bacteria in certain environments.
