The research reported on the errors in the GAnswer tool found that about 9% of the errors in queries were due to the tool's inability to handle queries with unions or filters. The study also discussed the composition of a SPARQL query, which consists of triple patterns placed after the "where" keyword or after the target variables in the query. The research focused on processing user-submitted queries to identify potential triples used to construct SPARQL graphs, which were categorized as user triples. Additionally, the study described the development of a lexicon using the Lemon model for ontologies, which allowed for machine-readable representations of information relative to the underlying ontology.

Furthermore, the study detailed the processing of non-relational and relation-based queries, as well as the categorization and handling of different types of adjectives in queries. The evaluation of the PAROT system for question answering over linked data was discussed, comparing its performance with the GAnswer tool. PAROT demonstrated higher recall and precision, but had limitations in handling specific types of queries and had slower query response times compared to GAnswer. Finally, the paper also mentioned the acknowledgment of contributions made by non-authors to the research.
