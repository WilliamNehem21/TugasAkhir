High throughput screening (HTS) is a widely utilized approach in the pharmaceutical industry for identifying potential drug candidates. Recent advancements in screening technologies, such as quantitative HTS and the use of selectivity assays, have led to an increase in the volume of dose-response (DR) results generated. Various techniques, including phage display and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), have contributed to the generation of large DR datasets. The reliability and quality of the DR curves are influenced by screening conditions, assay protocols, compound behavior, and the presence of outliers. Consequently, the manual review of DR curves becomes time-consuming, particularly in cases of high hit rates, and is subject to the expertise of the reviewer and available analysis time. This approach can lead to delays in projects and result in inconsistent and less robust analyses over time.

Challenges in DR experiments can result in curves deviating from ideal shapes, which may be attributed to compound properties or experimental conditions. The concept of Pan Assay Interference Compounds (PAINS) has been introduced to identify structural characteristics associated with false positive compounds, but not all PAINS compounds exhibit defective curves, and vice versa.

A novel approach, AI4DR, has been developed to facilitate the analysis of high-throughput DR experiments using machine learning (ML) models. Specifically, a convolutional neural network (CNN) has been employed to classify DR curves, ensuring robustness and speed in the annotation process. The model's performance has been found to be comparable to expert annotations, and it has demonstrated the potential to identify specific profiles related to assay biology.

Overall, the AI4DR plugin offers benefits in terms of speed, robustness, and the potential to identify specific compounds with complex modes of action. The AI4DR solution addresses the need for accurate classification of large sets of DR curves, and it has the potential to filter out questionable results when developing predictive models using machine learning. Moreover, it can help mitigate bias in the analysis of DR datasets by multiple scientists, ultimately leading to a more homogeneous primary assignment and clustering before validation.
