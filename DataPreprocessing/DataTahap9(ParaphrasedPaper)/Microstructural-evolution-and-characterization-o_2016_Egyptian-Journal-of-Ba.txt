The structure of the coating produced by Zn-40MgO at 1.0 A/cm² was found to exhibit agglomeration of solid crystals with a limited dispersion of film, leading to inadequate adhesion. This issue is attributed to the increased presence of particulates in the electrolyte bath, which substantially impacts the transfer rate of films from the anodic area. Notably, the hardness profile of the coatings displayed a marked improvement, with the Zn-20MgO at 0.5 A/cm² exhibiting the most enhanced hardness property of 236.4 HVN. The improvements in hardness are linked to crystal formation and superior nucleation, affected by the operating conditions. The microstructure, thermal-oxidation, and micro-mechanical properties of Zn-MgO composite coatings were examined, revealing that the deposition of binary composite particles, in combination with MgO ceramic particulates, significantly enhanced the mechanical and corrosion performance of the coatings. Moreover, the new crystalline structures formed as a result of heat treatment, with Zn20MgO at 0.5 A/cm² coatings demonstrating strong performance and possessing the best properties among all series. Additionally, the thermal stability of the composite coating was shown to improve with a moderate addition of MgO into the Zn2+ interface. Finally, the favorable morphology of the coatings hindered the penetration of high temperatures, contributing to the stability of the alloy.
