The subsequent task involves demonstrating that these morphisms can constitute a natural transformation denoted as "m: rh zs," which serves as a monad morphism and, moreover, a morphism of Elgot monads. The proof is intricate and entails leveraging the axioms of Elgot monads for rh, as well as the defined nature of the dagger operation of rh in multiple stages (see and). Owing to limitations in space, we are unable to include the specific details.
