Recent studies' broad applicability is compromised when the matching constraints within the calculations yield multiple solutions, leading to the generation of several substitutions. Notably, there is currently no universally accepted method for comparing substitutions. As a result, representations of term collections should be handled using sets or at least an associative and commutative structure.

The forthcoming definition and lemma are pivotal in demonstrating the Church-Rosser property in Section 5. They formalize the notion that if a multiplicative relation on simple terms satisfies the multi-diamond property (specifically, if its singleton extension satisfies the diamond property), then its multiplicative extension also fulfills this property.

Miquel recommended a relevant reading to the author, which served as the starting point for this research. H. Cirstea provided valuable feedback on earlier versions of the paper that greatly contributed to its development. We are also grateful to L. Vaux and C. Kirchner for their insightful discussions and feedback on this work.
