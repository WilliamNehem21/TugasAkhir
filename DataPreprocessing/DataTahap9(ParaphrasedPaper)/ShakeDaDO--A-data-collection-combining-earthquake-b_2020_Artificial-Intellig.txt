The seismic ground motion parameters analyzed in this study include MCS intensity, peak ground acceleration, peak ground velocity, and spectral acceleration at 0.3s, 1.0s, and 3.0s, along with their associated uncertainties. These parameters were chosen due to their comprehensive representation of shaking, particularly in terms of structures sensitive to low, intermediate, and long periods. The information on building damage and characteristics, as well as the ground shaking parameters, was combined into a unified dataset, a unique initiative for Italy. This integrated dataset has facilitated the development of novel strategies for addressing earthquake impacts, such as the training of machine learning models.

The severity of building damage was categorized into four grades: moderate damage, heavy damage, very heavy damage, and destruction. The input data for the shakemap calculation was selected from a single database (ESM), aligning with the choice made for the extended fault associated with the earthquake. The paper describes the adopted ground motion models and the new map of Vs30 for site effects and provides detailed insight into the earthquakes considered and the relevant shakemaps that were generated.

The study emphasizes the significance of machine learning in seismic hazard and risk assessment and announces the distribution of the Shakedado data collection within the DA.D.O. GIS platform. The paper also acknowledges the use of the LandScan (2015) high-resolution global population dataset and attributes its ownership to UT-Battelle, LLC, the operator of Oak Ridge National Laboratory, under contract with the United States Department of Energy, recognizing the rights and responsibilities associated with the dataset.
