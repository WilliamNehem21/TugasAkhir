The study investigated the difference in transcript abundance between two inbred strains by examining the impact of mutations on methylated CpG sites. The researchers hypothesized that mutations abolishing methylated CpG sites would lead to increased transcript levels, which was supported by their findings. The effect of mutations on transcription was contingent on the density of CpG sites, with significant effects observed in regions with high CpG density but not in those with low CpG density. Moreover, mutations in high-density CpG regions were associated with a small yet meaningful variation in transcript abundance, and were enriched in chromatin states indicative of enhancers. The study acknowledged several limitations, including the possibility that the findings may not apply to all cell types, as well as the confined focus on CpG sites in the hippocampus. The data underwent quality control and pre-processing using the Seurat package, and stringent filtering criteria were applied to ensure the high quality of biological samples.
