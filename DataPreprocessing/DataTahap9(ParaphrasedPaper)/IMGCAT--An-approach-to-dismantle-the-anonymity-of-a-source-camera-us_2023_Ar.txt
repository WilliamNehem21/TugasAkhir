The widespread availability of smartphones has led to the ease of digital data collection. While image analysis capabilities have improved, the authentication of image sources has not kept pace. Image editing and tampering have become more prevalent due to advancements in signal processing technology. New techniques such as seam carving have been used to conceal the camera identity, particularly in the context of child pornography. This article focuses on analyzing available image features based on photo response non-uniformity (PRNU).

The traditional belief in the reliability of photographs has been called into question due to the availability of powerful image editing tools and advancements in digital media technology. Accessible software such as Adobe Photoshop, Corel Paint Shop Pro, Skylum, Canva, and Stencil make it easy to manipulate digital images.

To address the shortcomings of feature-based approaches, various techniques using different learning frameworks have been proposed to enable networks to automatically learn forensic features. Many CNN-based multimedia forensics approaches have been developed using deep learning. These approaches utilize CNNs specialized for learning low-level forensic features while suppressing image content.

The article explores seam insertion and deletion as major methodologies for image manipulation. It discusses the process of acquiring forged images and examines the selection of blocks and numerical analyses. Different CNN models have been employed to identify image manipulations, and these methods have been evaluated using experimental approaches and decision matrices.

The article presents a case study illustrating the problem of source identification and proposes a solution using seam carving for insertion and deletion scenarios. The study assesses the impact of varying the number of groups used to construct camera fingerprints and concludes that multiple fingerprints may be more reliable than a single PRNU.

Further analysis reveals insights into the model's performance and its ability to learn complex patterns present in the data. The study also explores the balance between improving accuracy and reliability in source attribution tasks.

The study concludes that the proposed framework enables the CNN to learn additional characteristics and traces of camera models and explores the use of LSTM capabilities for image localization.
