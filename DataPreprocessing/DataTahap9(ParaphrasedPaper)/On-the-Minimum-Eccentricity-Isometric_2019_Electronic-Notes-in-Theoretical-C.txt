This paper explores the problem of finding the minimum eccentricity isometric cycle (MEIC) in a given graph, which involves identifying an isometric cycle with the smallest possible eccentricity value, denoted as k. The authors demonstrate that this problem is NP-hard and propose a 3-approximation algorithm that runs in O(n(m+kn)) time.

For graph classification and application purposes, it is crucial to condense a graph into a simpler structure such as a tree, a path, or, in the context of this paper, a cycle. Different constructions and metrics, such as tree-decompositions and tree-width, offer such characterizations. Another approach, which is the focus of this paper, involves studying the problem in terms of domination.

In the case of paths, the problem entails finding a path in which every vertex in the graph belongs to or has a neighbor in that path. Various graph classes have been defined based on dominating paths. Graphs containing a dominating pair, consisting of vertices such that every path linking them is dominating, have been studied. The presence of short dominating paths in all induced subgraphs characterizes graphs in another class. Additionally, linear-time algorithms have been developed for finding dominating paths or dominating vertex pairs in AT-free graphs.

While dominating paths do not exist in every graph, the concept of k-coverage (also known as k-domination) serves as a natural extension of domination. In k-coverage, a path k-covers the graph if every vertex is at a distance of at most k from the path. The smallest k for which a path k-covers the graph serves as a desired metric.

The minimum-eccentricity shortest path (MESP) problem, introduced by Dragan and Leitert, involves finding the shortest path with minimal eccentricity. This problem is NP-complete, and approximation algorithms have been designed for it. The MESP problem is also linked to graph embedding with low distortion and is relevant to graph problems arising from biological datasets.

In the paper, an isometric cycle in a graph g with a cycle c is defined as a cycle in which the distance between any two vertices u and v in c is equal to the distance between them in g. This means that one of the two paths linking u and v in the cycle is a shortest path in the graph. The problem of interest involves finding an isometric cycle with minimum eccentricity.

It is mentioned in the paper that the longest isometric cycle can be computed in O(n^4.752 log(n)) time, providing a polynomial-time 3-approximation for the MEIC problem. The paper also establishes that a graph admitting an isometric cycle with low eccentricity also supports a cycle embedding with low distortion.

Additionally, the paper presents a contradiction case for a vertex x appearing more than once in a given cycle. If x is in a particular path, it should have been selected instead of the other path, leading to a contradiction. The same contradiction arises if x is in a different path, demonstrating the inconsistencies in the construction.
