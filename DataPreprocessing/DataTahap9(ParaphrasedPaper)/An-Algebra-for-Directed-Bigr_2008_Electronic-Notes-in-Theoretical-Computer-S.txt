In Section 2, the primary definitions related to directed bigraphs and abstract directed bigraphs are briefly reviewed. The algebraic structure of directed bigraphs is then examined in Section 3, and this analysis is extended to the category of abstract directed bigraphs in Section 4. In Section 5, directed bigraphs are used to encode the fusion calculus. The conclusions of the paper are presented in Section 6.

Furthermore, we introduce variations of the tensor product that allow for name sharing. In process calculi, a parallel product p| q is commonly used to enable processes p and q to share names. In the context of directed bigraphs, this sharing can involve inward downward names and/or outward upward names, as specified by the subsequent definitions.
