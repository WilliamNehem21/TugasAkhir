This study focuses on analyzing the thermal behavior and thermal-structure coupling of the spindle system in high speed and high precision machining centers using the finite element method. The research simulates the heat dissipation capacity of the spindle system's cooling system and predicts thermal deformation. The findings of the simulation can offer insights to guide the robust design of the spindle system.

During the working process, the machine tool experiences various heat sources, which affect its precision through internal and external heat resources. Internal heat sources, such as cutting heat and internal friction-induced heat, are found to be the primary contributors to thermal deformation.

The paper primarily considers forced convection heat transfer and examines the impact of different fluid flow patterns on heat transfer. Empirical formulas are employed to calculate the heat transfer coefficient based on the Reynolds number, which serves as a criterion to determine the fluid's laminar or turbulent flow characteristics.

To validate the analysis results, data acquisition experiments are conducted to understand temperature field changes and thermal deformation of the spindle under practical conditions. The research demonstrates the reliability of the finite element analysis and provides valuable insights for the design of the spindle system and thermal error compensation.
