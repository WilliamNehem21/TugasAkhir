In recent years, the prevalence of border criminals and unauthorized immigrants has risen globally due to the inadequacy of proper border authorization methods. Typically, trained immigration officers conduct passenger controls at border locations by comparing passports and physical appearances, although some countries utilize automated border control (ABC) systems. ABC systems, which encompass multimodal biometric authorization, present a significant real-world application of biometric technology. However, the selection of an appropriate classification method in the decision-making process poses challenges. This paper introduces a novel architecture for multimodal biometric authorization that employs a multi-agent system (MAS) to optimize the solution using MAS features such as coordination, cooperation, and negotiation. The efficiency of the proposed method was demonstrated through experiments using four available multimodal datasets, including the National Institute of Standard Technology (NIST) multimodal, SDUMLA-HMT multimodal, BANCA, and private databases. The experimental results showed excellent performance in comparison to previous ABC systems during the authentication phase and exhibited computational speed.

Biometrics, which consist of unique biological patterns such as fingerprints, iris patterns, voice, and face features, have become cost-effective and easily accessible traits in recent years due to advances in computer security. Biometric technologies utilize these traits to authorize individuals for various tasks through biometric authorization systems. There are two types of biometric authentication systems: multimodal and unimodal, with multimodal systems being favored for their improvements over unimodal systems despite the existence of spoofing attacks on single biometrics. The utilization of biometric traits for passenger flow control represents a noteworthy advancement in the biometric domain, particularly as traditional border control methods relying on passport facial images have proven vulnerable and contributed to rising threats such as drugs, fraud, and crime, affecting sectors like national security, finance, and tourism.

Automated biometric authorization systems have seen significant advancements through the integration of machine learning techniques. Although various classification algorithms have exhibited high performance at the research level, achieving reliable results in real-world applications, particularly in time-critical environments with large databases, presents challenges. As a result, the combination of classifiers (multi-classifiers) has become more reliable and widespread, though the optimal choice of combination method remains a difficult decision-making task. This paper proposes a multi-classifier, multimodal, multi-agent-based architecture to address these challenges and achieve an optimal result by negotiating a strategy using agent-based architecture.

The paper presents a multi-agent-based multimodal concept, outlining the strategy's negotiation methods and detailing the multi-classifier and base classifier components. The system comprises three main parts: face and fingerprint capturing, MAS negotiation, and authentication result output. The proposed methodology involves capturing passenger face and fingerprint images, preprocessing the images, and utilizing multi-classifiers to compare the captured images with previously stored data. The selection of the most appropriate result from these fusions is achieved using a multi-agent method, representing the main novelty of this work.

In addition to proposing the multi-agent-based multimodal concept, the paper discusses the selection of four classifiers (convolutional neural networks with softmax, support vector machine, linear regression, and random forest) for recognition and verification agents and evaluates their performance. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through experiments involving four databases: the NIST multimodal dataset, SDUMLA-HMT multimodal database, BANCA database, and a private dataset, leading to comparisons with existing ABC systems. The paper is organized as follows: section 2 discusses related works, section 3 outlines the proposed methodology, section 4 delves into the hardware design and implementation, section 5 presents the experimental results, and section 6 draws conclusions.
