The paper discusses the concept of specification patterns, which are designed to capture commonly occurring patterns in the property specification of concurrent and reactive systems. These patterns are characterized by different scopes, such as global, before, after, between, and after-until, each defining the range in which the pattern must hold.

Furthermore, the paper proposes a classification of specification patterns based on the types of system behaviors they describe. Patterns are divided into two main categories: occurrence patterns and order patterns, each further subcategorized into different types. However, the paper does not provide a detailed description of this classification.

Additionally, the paper introduces an approach for translating OCL (Object Constraint Language) specifications into natural language using a multilingual syntax-directed editor. This approach differs from previous methods, as it allows formal OCL specifications to be translated into descriptions that can be understood by individuals unfamiliar with OCL.
