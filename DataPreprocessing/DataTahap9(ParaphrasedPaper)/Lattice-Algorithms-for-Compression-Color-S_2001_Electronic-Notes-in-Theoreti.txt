The JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) standard is commonly used for compressing and storing digital color images. When dealing with a color image that has been previously compressed using JPEG in an undisclosed color space, the objective is to infer this unknown compression color space from the image. This knowledge could be beneficial for enhancing color images and re-compressing them using the appropriate color space.

The color space utilized in a previously JPEG-compressed image is typically lost in its current uncompressed representation. For instance, when a display or printing driver receives the bitmap of the uncompressed image, it lacks information about the color space in which the image was initially compressed. To improve or re-compress such color images, understanding the compression color space would be advantageous.

The paper discusses the geometry of DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform) coefficients in the observed color space, assuming the absence of round-off errors. It explains that the vectors of DCT coefficients align with a lattice structure, and the LLL algorithm could be used to identify the vectors corresponding to the edges of the lattice. It also addresses the geometry of DCT coefficients in the compression color space considering the presence of round-off during decompression, as well as the impact of round-off errors on DCT coefficient geometry in the observed color space. The proposed algorithm is designed to accurately estimate the vectors corresponding to the edges of the lattice from the given set of perturbed 3D vectors of DCT coefficients.

In order to validate the proposed algorithm, a test color image that was JPEG-compressed in the ITU.BT-601 YCbCr space with a quality factor of 70 was utilized. Our analysis suggests that the DCT coefficients of a previously JPEG-compressed image exhibit an approximate lattice structure, which can be exploited to determine the unknown compression color space. To estimate this geometric structure, the paper proposes an estimation algorithm that combines statistical noise reduction with the lattice reduction algorithm from number theory. Through simulations, the algorithm effectively estimates the desired compression color space.
