The energy recovery system involves utilizing waste gas with high temperature to harness potential energy in the cylinder. The waste gas, after being exhausted, condenses to form water, which is then circulated through a cooling tower for cooling. The cooled water returns to the condenser, where it is pressurized and vaporized. To fully utilize the potential energy in the returning water, a turbine is installed in the return pipeline to generate power by recycling the energy from the waste gas and liquid.

The regulation system allows for accurate and automated adjustment of input signals in accordance with user-defined procedures. Once the procedures are established, the associated algorithms are also determined. The PCC governor executes judgment and operation according to the set procedures.

To enhance the accuracy and reliability of the speed measurement system, three independent measuring points are selected, and an "3 take 2" overspeed protection function is implemented to prevent coasting. When any two of the three measuring points reach the alarm value, the program issues a turbine overspeed instruction, and the alarm system takes protective action to prevent damage from system malfunctions, thus improving the protective action's reliability and effectively avoiding unsafe incidents.

Computer simulations are commonly used for comprehensive analysis of turbine regulating systems, but the preparation and debugging of simulation calculations are labor-intensive. In addition, the portability of simulation programs is limited, making it challenging to adapt to the unique characteristics of hydropower and lacking strong graphics output support. The use of MATLAB as an international software for system simulation could help overcome these limitations.

A single neuron adaptive PID control method is employed to regulate turbine speed by modeling the workflow of neurons. When there is a difference between the turbine speed and the target value, the control system automatically calculates the difference. If the difference falls within the safe range, the system operates normally without needing to take action. However, if the difference exceeds the safe range, the system initiates the regulating process. After self-organizing, self-correcting, and self-regulating actions, the system finds the optimal working condition and adjusts the operation of the control servomotor to maintain stability in the best working condition.

The speed control and regulation of hydroturbines are crucial in modern industry. This paper presents a comprehensive turbine governing system and simulation, demonstrating that the integrated system can maintain stable operation conditions for hydroturbines, thus contributing to energy recovery and achieving low-carbon production.
