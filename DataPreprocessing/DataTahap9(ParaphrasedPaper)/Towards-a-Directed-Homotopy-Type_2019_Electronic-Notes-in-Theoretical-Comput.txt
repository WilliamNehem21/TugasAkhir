These findings offer an insightful perspective on the concept of higher groupoids. Although this concept has been extensively studied by topologists using specific models for almost a century, there is a potential for further exploration regarding the theory of irreversible or directed paths within the framework of higher groupoids. The development of a type theory to describe directed paths may provide new insights into the less comprehensively understood theories of higher categories and directed spaces. Given that both of these theories are centered around the concept of directed paths and have various competing concrete models, the establishment of a synthetic theory for directed paths could provide clarity in this area.
