Wireless sensor networks are extensively utilized in various environments, and they often face stochastic uncertainties and disturbances such as message loss and node dynamics. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure the correctness of low-level protocols in wireless sensor networks and evaluate their performance under diverse circumstances. This paper introduces a novel approach to analyze and assess wireless sensor network protocols using stochastic timed automata and statistical model checking.

The workflow of a wireless sensor network protocol can be represented using classical timed automata for modeling purposes. To account for uncertainties like message loss and node dynamics in realistic scenarios, the timed automata can be augmented with stochastic transitions to form stochastic timed automata. Verification of protocol correctness can be achieved using classical model checking on the timed automata, while the performance evaluation under practical environments can be conducted through statistical model checking on the stochastic model. To demonstrate the feasibility and scalability of the proposed modeling and verification method, the timing-sync protocol for sensor networks (TPSN) is thoroughly studied in this paper.

Wireless sensor networks have garnered global attention and are utilized in various applications such as military operations, medical care, and environmental monitoring. The proper functioning of high-level applications in wireless sensor networks relies on robust and reliable low-level protocols. Given the difficulty in modifying deployed devices in wireless sensor networks, it is critical to ensure that the protocols operate effectively within their designated environment during the design phase.

Classical timed automata are a natural modeling language for wireless sensor network protocols, given the intensive connection with real-time behaviors. However, these automata can only represent system behaviors under ideal circumstances. As wireless sensor networks can be deployed in diverse environments and encounter uncertainties, the introduction of stochastic behaviors into timed automata is essential to capture realistic system dynamics.

While model checking has been widely used to verify the correctness of wireless sensor network protocols, its exhaustive exploration of the state space makes it expensive and limits its applicability to large-scale networks. Fortunately, statistical model checking offers a simulation-based alternative that is less resource-intensive and can estimate the probability of a system satisfying a given property. The combination of stochastic timed automata and statistical model checking presents a new method for modeling and evaluating wireless sensor network protocols.

The paper proceeds with a description of existing works on modeling and verification of wireless sensor network protocols and an introduction to stochastic timed automata in section 2. Section 3 presents the proposed method for modeling and evaluating protocols using stochastic timed automata, followed by the application of this method to a well-known wireless sensor network protocol and the evaluation results in section 4. The paper concludes with final remarks in section 5.

In summary, previous works often overlooked the incorporation of uncertainty behaviors into the modeling and evaluation of wireless sensor network protocols. Additionally, while most works focused on the correctness verification of protocols, only a few addressed the performance evaluation under different environmental profiles. The scalability limitations of current analysis techniques, mainly model checking and probabilistic model checking, hinder their application to real-case large-scale systems.
