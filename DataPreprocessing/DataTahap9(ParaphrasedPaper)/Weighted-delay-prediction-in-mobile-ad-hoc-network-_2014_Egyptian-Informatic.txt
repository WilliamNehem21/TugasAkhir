The nodes in mobile ad hoc network (MANET) are in constant motion and do not rely on any fixed infrastructure, such as base stations, to relay packets. Each node has a transmission range within which it can communicate directly with other nodes, and if two nodes are beyond each other's transmission range, they can utilize intermediate nodes to facilitate communication, a mode of communication known as multi-hop. MANETs are attractive for various applications due to their distributed and flexible nature, such as deep space communication, disaster relief, and battlefield communication. Understanding the delay performance of such networks is crucial for providing quality of service (QoS) for these applications, but modeling the end-to-end delay in MANETs remains a challenging task due to factors such as node mobility, interference, and the complex packet delivery process.

Node mobility patterns significantly impact the overall packet delay in MANET, with varying mobility characteristics affecting the end-to-end delay. In this paper, we propose a weighted delay prediction mechanism that utilizes regression on path length and fuzzy time series on previous delays. Trapezoidal fuzzy numbers are used in the fuzzy time series due to their effectiveness in prediction compared to triangular fuzzy numbers. The performance of the prediction models is evaluated using criteria such as root mean squared errors (RMSEs), correlation coefficient (r), and efficiency (e), with the aim of aiding the research community in analyzing and modeling delay in MANETs more comprehensively.

The paper includes a review of related works on network delay, an explanation of fuzzy time series, details of the simulation environment, and the development of the model based on path length and fuzzy time series. The discussions on the results obtained are also presented, along with comparisons with previous research on delay prediction mechanisms. However, it is noted that certain factors such as the impact of node mobility patterns, routing protocols, and network characteristics were not extensively considered in some existing works on delay analysis in MANETs.
