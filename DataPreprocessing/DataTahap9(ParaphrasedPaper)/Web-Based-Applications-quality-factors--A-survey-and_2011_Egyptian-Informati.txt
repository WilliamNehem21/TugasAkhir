The paper presents a conceptual quality model for web-based applications (WBA) that effectively captures the perspectives of various stakeholders, such as visitors, owners, and end users. The primary objective of the paper is to identify, categorize, and model the quality factors of WBAs.

The internet has evolved into a critical platform for information and communication, posing unique challenges for the development of web-based applications to meet a diverse user population. As WBAs are more complex than simple HTML web pages, there is a growing interest in developing high-quality WBAs. However, defining and capturing the quality of WBAs in an organized manner remains a challenging task.

The structure of the paper is as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of established quality models and factors for WBAs, as well as a survey of well-known software quality models. Section 3 presents a conceptual quality model for WBAs and the different quality perspectives underlying WBA quality. Section 4 summarizes the paper and outlines future work.

While there has been significant work on WBA quality in the past decade, most existing empirical studies are exploratory and focused on traditional data processing and information retrieval, lacking a comprehensive assessment of WBA quality factors. The extended ISO model was selected as a reference point for this study, as it is widely accepted in the software industry.

Researchers and practitioners have been exploring ways to characterize software quality since the 1970s, leading to the development of numerous quality models. The ISO/IEC 9126/2001 standard provides a software quality model defining internal and external software qualities and their connection to software attributes. This model follows the factor-criteria-metrics model proposed by McCall (1977) and defines six quality factors.

In addition, a comprehensive set of software quality attributes has been organized into objectives, each composed of a set of quality factors and further decomposed into sub-factors. Different models have also been presented, such as the WBA quality model proposed by Fitzpatrick, which considers five quality characteristics related to the World Wide Web domain.

Furthermore, the paper emphasizes the importance of considering the needs of WBA users, which may differ from those of the owner company. The hypermedia nature of the internet and the significance of aspects related to interfaces, access speed, and security differentiate WBAs from traditional information systems. The heterogeneous skills of individuals involved in WBA design can significantly impact quality, and developers may be unaware of the technology's characteristics affecting WBA performance.

The paper also highlights the crucial role of a sound WBA in integrating visitor needs and owner promotion, as communication between a firm and its customers often occurs through web-based interfaces. The proposed model suggests a conceptual framework to identify the different views and usages of WBAs, classifying quality factors and sub-factors that align with these viewpoints. Additionally, the model applies ISO 9126 quality factors and sub-factors to review common features between WBAs and software, thereby proposing a set of new WBA quality factors tailored to the unique characteristics of WBAs.

In the future, the model will be extended through experimental studies and supported by a validation framework to provide evidence of the suggested WBA quality factors and sub-factors.
