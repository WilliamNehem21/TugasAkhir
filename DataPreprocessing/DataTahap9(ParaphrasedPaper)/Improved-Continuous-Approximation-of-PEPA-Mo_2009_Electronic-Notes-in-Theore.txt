Increasingly, there is a growing trend of utilizing theoretical computer science techniques, such as process algebras, to address biological problems [3,15,14]. The rationale behind this approach is the belief that formal specification can provide deeper insight into the issues at hand. Process algebras offer various forms of analysis that were previously unavailable to biologists. Specifically in the context of epidemiology, the study of disease spread, process algebra allows for the description of individual-based models based on observations of individual behavior, and subsequently facilitates the automatic derivation of population-level models. This enables the investigation of epidemic properties and the outcomes of control methods. Until now, theoretical biologists have been constrained to working exclusively at either the individual-based or population-based scale, lacking the ability to transition between these scales using traditional methods. 

This paper introduces new models of biological epidemics using the PEPA process algebra, which presents an innovative application of PEPA. The objective is to assess the suitability of PEPA language features for epidemiology and to compare the results with previous modeling work in WSCCS. A key distinction between the formalisms lies in the shift from actions occurring in discrete time and weighted choice (WSCCS) to actions occurring in continuous time at a specified rate and choice driven by competition between rates (PEPA). Additionally, PEPA allows for synchronization between multiple components.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides an introduction to PEPA and ODE derivation as previously described. Section 3 presents the epidemiological models and compares the derived ODEs with simulation results. The insights gained from these models lead to the modified ODE derivation method presented in Section 4. Finally, the results are discussed in Section 5.

The component "p+q" represents a system that can behave as either "p" or "q", with both activities being enabled. The system will behave based on the derivative resulting from the evolution of the chosen component.

The method employed by Hillston cannot be used to derive ODEs for this model due to the use of passive rates, which can be overcome by setting all passive rates to the matching local rate (e.g., all actions "contact, t" become "contact, cr").

Two models of disease spread in PEPA have been presented, categorizing transmission into direct and indirect transmission. It is observed that it is feasible to model these different mechanisms within PEPA, with indirect transmission being somewhat more naturally expressed. The use of PEPA provides significant advantages over WSCCS in terms of tool support, links to other formalisms, and ongoing language developments for biology.

Cardelli has also developed a method of deriving ODEs from process algebra models, with the motivation to provide a process algebra semantics matching the mass action behavior of chemical systems. This introduces a new semantics unrelated to the usual synchronization semantics of process algebras. In the context of epidemiology, the ability to transition between the scales of individual and population is essential to preserve the transient dynamics of the system, ensuring that the ODE approximation aligns with the CTMC semantics.

The use of process algebra for epidemiology yields new insights into disease spread, as it allows for the rigorous justification of population-level ODEs based on observed individual behavior. Further work in this area, including the application of knowledge gained from modeling biological diseases to computer systems, is planned as part of the system dynamics project. An obvious candidate for such modeling is the spread of computer viruses and other malware.
