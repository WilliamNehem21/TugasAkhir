Situational stress is a form of short-term acute stress that arises from temporary situations. Pre-service teachers (PSTs) may experience teaching-related situational anxieties or stress which can diminish their effectiveness in the classroom, eventually leading to burnout as a result of increased psychological allostatic load (Lamb, 2014; Lamb, Hoston, & Firestone, 2022). One approach to mitigate situational stress and excessive cognitive demand during teaching is to cultivate protective factors such as creativity and mental flexibility (MF). Protective factors are characteristics or behaviors associated with a reduced likelihood of negative psychological or physiological outcomes, particularly in high-stress, high-demand environments like the classroom (Bottiani, Duran, Pas, & Bradshaw, 2019). Studies demonstrate that PSTs find teaching their peers and their initial opportunities to teach in K-12 classrooms highly stressful and excessively cognitively demanding (Weis et al, 2020). To address some of the challenges associated with microteaching, the incorporation of virtual reality (VR) based simulated teaching experiences with artificially intelligent avatars has been proposed. VR may alleviate some of the difficulties of microteaching by eliminating audience effects and enabling greater use of mental flexibility and creativity, which could protect against and reduce stress responses and cognitive demand (Kapoor & Khan, 2019). VR has the potential to provide consistent, high-quality small-scale experiences for PSTs to explore and experiment with innovative ideas, thereby increasing the availability of protective factors such as MF and creativity. Importantly, the low-stakes environment of VR may lead to reduced stress and cognitive demand, thus enhancing learning opportunities.

To explore the influence of VR on outcomes and the potential of protective factors to enhance learning reception, the authors aimed to investigate the relationship between VR, stress, creativity, cognitive demand, and mental flexibility. The study's primary objective was to identify differences in creativity, mental flexibility, acute stress, and cognitive demand between PSTs engaging in VR and those participating in microteaching. A secondary aim was to understand if creativity and mental flexibility moderate or mediate stress and cognitive demand. The research questions focused on the potential differences in physiological and neurological responses between students using VR and those engaging in microteaching, as well as the relationship between levels of creativity and mental flexibility with acute stress and cognitive demand in both teaching conditions.

In addition to the academic paper's content, it discusses the measures used in the study, including real-time neurocognitive measures of cognitive demand via hemodynamic response, autonomic nervous system (ANS) measures of stress, and psychological/behavioral measures of creativity and mental flexibility. Real-time neurocognitive measures involve quantifying hemodynamics, which correlates with the oxygenated and deoxygenated blood ratio in neurologically active areas of the brain. This allows for a fine-grained examination of participants' physiological and cognitive characteristics. The study employed repeated measures ANOVA and a Tukey-HSD post-hoc test to analyze the data, as well as path model analysis to understand the interconnections between the variables of interest.

The study's findings suggest that VR may offer PSTs a relatively stress-free environment for professional development, enabling more effective integration of new information. While microteaching presents some positive aspects, it may induce higher levels of stress and cognitive demand due to audience effects and unrealistic peer responses. The study recommends a tiered approach, starting with microteaching, transitioning to VR, and ultimately moving into actual classrooms. This gradually releases control and allows for safe conditions and opportunities for practice, potentially reducing stress and enhancing reflection and assessment.

The study also highlights certain limitations, such as gender balance in the participant sample and the absence of baseline data on PSTs' entrance into the preparation program. Future research may address issues highlighted in the study, providing greater clarity on PSTs' development during their program and the effectiveness of VR in reducing stress and cognitive demand.
