This paper demonstrates the adaptation of sweeping line techniques, commonly used in computational geometry, to the static analysis of computer software through abstract interpretation. It discusses the utilization of the sweeping line concept to represent elements of a numerical abstract domain of boxes, which is a disjunctive refinement of the well-known interval domain allowing a finite number of disjunctions. The paper includes a detailed description of the representation and standard domain operation algorithms, as well as the introduction of a precise widening operator for the domain.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the problem being addressed, while Section 3 describes the adaptation of the sweeping line technique. Section 4 presents the representation of elements of the box domain, and Section 5 outlines the implementation of domain operators. Additionally, Section 6 introduces a new widening operator for boxes, while Section 7 discusses transfer functions. The paper concludes with a discussion in Section 8.

The paper also aims to extend the basic version of the interval domain to represent finite disjunctions of intervals, as opposed to only convex sets. The abstract domain of intervals is defined formally as a tuple with a set of variables and a chosen ring of reals, rationals, or integers.

The sweeping line technique involves imagining a line (usually vertical) being swept across the plane, stopping at various points. A data structure associated with the sweeping line is updated each time the line stops, and once the line has covered all points, a relevant result is computed from the data structure.
