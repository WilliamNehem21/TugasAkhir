In various fields of natural language processing research, the significance of bilingual corpora is becoming increasingly evident. Different applications necessitate aligned bilingual corpora at various levels of granularity and corresponding technologies, encompassing articles, paragraphs, sentences, phrases, and words. Aligned bilingual corpora at the sentence level are essential for example-based machine translation.

The multi-alignment penalty factor is employed to address alignment conflicts. For example, when alignment conflicts arise and it is necessary to determine whether the style is 1-2 or the two elements are aligned 1-1 and 0-1, the similarity of these three types needs to be calculated, followed by the multiplication of the corresponding penalty factor. This process allows for the comparison of their modified similarity.

Our system consistently exhibits a lower error rate than the Gale system across all alignment styles. Specifically, our system's error rate is 2.3%, while Gale's is 3.5%. The experimental results and analysis presented above firmly demonstrate the effectiveness of our calculation model.
