To achieve the goals of an organization, it is important to have a comprehensive understanding of the norms and specifics of various resources such as labor, goods, and finances. These aspects allow decision-makers to set objectives aimed at maximizing profits within the constraints of limited resources. Inventory management is one of the key objectives in this regard, and the literature on inventory theory has continuously evolved to incorporate practical characteristics of existing inventory systems.

Two significant factors influence inventory management. Firstly, almost every supply chain contends with the challenge of holding stocks of obsolete or deteriorating goods. Some products lose their utility over time, while others decay as they are stored, experience physical depletion through desertion, or spoil directly. Therefore, the optimal inventory management strategy for such products involves minimizing the losses incurred due to deterioration. Secondly, changes in demand rates impact inventory policies.

Various scholars have developed models to address these factors. Manna and Chaudhuri, for instance, devised a model that accounted for time-dependent deterioration rates of goods with ramped demand, as well as a finite production rate proportional to the demand rate. Others, such as Panda, Senapati, and Basu, discussed inventory models for seasonal items, and Skouri, Konstantaras, Papachristos, and Ganas introduced models that consider demand rates with and without bottlenecks.

Ahmed, Al-Khamis, and Benkherouf were the first to consider a general deterioration rate, while Sanni and Chukwu developed an EOQ inventory model for items with a three-parameter Weibull distribution of deterioration. These studies, along with those by Amutha and Chandrasekaran, Srivastava and Singh, Shaikh et al., Sharma and Kaushik, Palanivelu and Chandrasekaran, and Supakar and Mahato, have contributed to the advancement of deteriorating inventory models with diverse demand and deterioration rate functions.

The structure of the remainder of the article includes the presentation of assumptions, symbols, and the description and formulation of Model-I, both with and without shortages in Section 2. This section also includes numerical examples to provide further insights. Section 3 covers a sensitivity analysis of the model parameters, while the results are presented in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 offers a conclusion of the study.
