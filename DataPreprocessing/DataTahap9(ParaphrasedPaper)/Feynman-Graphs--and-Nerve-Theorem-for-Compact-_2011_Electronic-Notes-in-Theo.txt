The use of string diagrams as a graphical calculus plays a crucial role in various theoretical frameworks of quantum mechanics and quantum informatics, as demonstrated in this collection. In this graphical representation, the objects of a category are denoted as strings, while the arrows are depicted as dots. Each arrow is interpreted as an operation, and in a simple category, each operation has exactly one input (source) and one output (target). Additionally, certain arrows satisfy specific properties, such as being injective and serving as fixpoint-free involutions. Furthermore, a connectedness condition is imposed for the purpose of the current discussion.

The various elements involved in this graphical calculus are formally defined. The set V represents the vertices, the set H denotes the half-edges or flags, and the set E represents the oriented edges. An involution, denoted as i, reverses the orientation of the edges, while a particular map, denoted as t, forgets the source of the edges, and another map, represented as s, returns the source of the edges pointing away from the vertex. A port is defined as an (oriented) edge outside the image of s, and the collection of ports of a graph is termed its interface. An inner edge is identified as an orbit under the involution containing elements within the image of s.

This definition closely resembles the colored version of the definition provided by Getzler and Kapranov. A formal argument demonstrating the monad structure of this endofunctor can be located elsewhere. By utilizing a third characterization, a heuristic argument (which can be formalized into a proof) is presented: f[n] signifies the set of isomorphism classes of n-f-graphs, representing the various ways to adorn n-graphs with the graphical species f. Moreover, f[n] corresponds to the set of n-graphs adorned by f-graphs, implying that each vertex is adorned with a graph possessing a compatible interface. This heuristic argument elucidates the monad structure, transforming a graph with vertices adorned by f-graphs into a single f-graph by erasing the circles representing the vertices.

The proof follows the principles and methodologies outlined by specific works. The primary objective is to establish that a particular left kan extension is preserved by the monad, which, in turn, relies on the generic/free factorization. Comprehensive details regarding this proof will be disclosed in the near future.
