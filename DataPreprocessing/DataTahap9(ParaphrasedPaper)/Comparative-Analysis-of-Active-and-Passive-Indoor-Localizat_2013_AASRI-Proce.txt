The positioning of individuals or objects is crucial, and the choice of technique for determining location is often application dependent. It is important to select a system that provides the necessary accuracy and precision for a specific application. Position-aware systems play a significant role in various domains, including asset tracking, healthcare, location-based services, gaming, manufacturing, government, logistics, retail, security, navigation, and event management.

Localization systems can be divided into indoor and outdoor systems. GPS is a widely used technology for outdoor location determination and is integrated into many mobile devices. However, it is not effective for indoor positioning due to the need for line-of-sight communication with satellites. In response, indoor localization systems have been developed based on radio frequency properties suitable for indoor environments. This survey paper focuses on these types of localization systems.

RFID positioning is based on electromagnetic communication between RFID readers and RFID tags, which can be passive or active. Passive tags have a limited range of about 1-2 meters and require expensive readers. In contrast, active tags have a much longer range, making them suitable for larger-scale applications.

Another type of localization system discussed in the paper is passive localization. While the number of passive localization systems is currently fewer compared to active localization, a recent development called device-free passive (DFP) localization has been introduced. The DFP system enables the detection and tracking of targets without the use of hardware devices or tags, relying on changes in the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) of wireless communication. Techniques like DFP have applications in security, military, and law enforcement, allowing for operations in hazardous building entry scenarios.
