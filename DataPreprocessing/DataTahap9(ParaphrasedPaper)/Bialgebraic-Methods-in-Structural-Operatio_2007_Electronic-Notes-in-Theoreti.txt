The issue becomes more intricate as new syntactic and computational paradigms continue to emerge from the rapidly evolving landscape of computing. These paradigms include probabilistic, timed, and hybrid systems, as well as those with global or local state, name passing, process passing, and stochastic systems. While these features can be described using certain forms of structural operational semantics, their treatment within the classical Transition System Specifications (TSS) framework is rather superficial, as it does not fully consider the semantic structure of the involved transition systems. As a result, existing approaches for verifying the well-behavedness of semantic descriptions are difficult to adapt to these new paradigms, often requiring the redevelopment of solutions from scratch for each case.

To address these challenges and better prepare for future changes in the computing landscape, there is hope that the Structural Operational Semantics (SOS) framework will be more appropriately equipped. The theoretical foundations for such a framework were initially proposed by Turi and Plotkin, and are rooted in the coalgebraic account of transition systems. This account classifies various types of processes based on the notion of behavior, which is modeled as a functor on a category and formally represents the abstract concept of computational paradigm. By combining this coalgebraic approach with classical algebraic syntax, bialgebraic semantics of processes have been developed, offering a generalization and explanation of these computational paradigms.

The subsequent section introduces the framework of bialgebraic semantics along with some of the results obtained through its application. Readers are expected to be familiar with the basic definitions and techniques of structural operational semantics, as well as foundational concepts of category theory such as category, functor, and natural transformation. The contributions of bialgebraic semantics, including the guarantee of bisimilarity as a congruence on the induced LTS (Labelled Transition System), have significant implications. It has been shown that these congruence properties can be proved on the abstract level of distributive laws, and subsequently translated to SOS frameworks based on different notions of syntax and behavior. Several applications of these results, as well as other work on bialgebraic semantics, are further discussed in this section.

Furthermore, the framework of bialgebraic semantics has been extended to encompass processes with timed transitions and to study the combination of timing with action. Congruence results regarding time bisimilarity have been proven, and a congruence format for the case of discrete time has been derived. Additionally, insights on combining different behaviors to achieve a modular account of semantics have been explored within this framework. Additionally, the special cases, as well as the more general notion of distributive laws of a monad over a comonad, have been studied on the abstract, categorical level, with various types of distributive laws explored and related. The application of different kinds of distributive laws to LTSSs is also discussed, with a complete proof of a one-to-one correspondence between abstract GSOS and concrete GSOS specifications included.
