Automata were introduced to capture both probability and the traditional process algebraic concept of nondeterminism. In this context, a state of an automaton may have multiple transitions that are chosen in a nondeterministic manner, and each transition leads to a probabilistic distribution over action-labeled moves. This model is typically referred to as the non-alternating model, in contrast to the alternating model where there is a clear distinction between nondeterministic states and probabilistic states.

Process algebras that adhere to the generative model do not include any operation for nondeterministic choice. Specifically, these process algebras do not introduce any operation that introduces nondeterminism. Furthermore, in the generative model, weak bisimulation is not generally a congruence. Many process algebras offer a parametric version of interleaving operation, where the parameter determines the probability of each of the two composed processes moving, and it is demonstrated through a simple example that weak bisimulation is not a congruence with regards to weak bisimulations. On the other hand, p-bisimulations allow for the comparison of two processes when they differ only in probabilities smaller than a given bound p. However, the focus here is not on studying their theory, but rather on using pbisimulations in proofs.

As for the proof, it should be noted that s has the form (t1 q rec x. c x) p rec x. b x and s' has the form (t2 q rec x. c x) p rec x. b x, for some t1 and t2. Four cases can be distinguished in this context.

Fokkink, R.J. van Glabbeek, and P. de Wind, presented at the Proceedings of the International Symposium on Formal Methods for Components and Objects, Lecture Notes in Computer Science 4111, Springer, Berlin, 2005, provides a thorough exploration of the topic.
