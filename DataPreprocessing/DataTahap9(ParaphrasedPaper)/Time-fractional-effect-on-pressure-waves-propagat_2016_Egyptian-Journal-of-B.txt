The primary characteristics responsible for the Newtonian fluid behavior of blood are the flexibility of red blood cells. Research findings indicate that at high shear rates, blood exhibits Newtonian fluid behavior. The viscosity of blood is significantly small compared to its nonlinear term, suggesting that it can be disregarded. Therefore, based on these findings, blood can be regarded as an incompressible, inviscid fluid.
