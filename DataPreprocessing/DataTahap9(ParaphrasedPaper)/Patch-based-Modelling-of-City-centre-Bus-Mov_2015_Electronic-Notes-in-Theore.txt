The data provided by Lothian Buses consists of automatic vehicle location (AVL) data gathered through periodic GPS location measurements. Each data entry includes a bus identifier, a location measurement, and a measurement timestamp. The dataset contains information about the entire fleet of 745 buses, collected between January 28th, 2014, at 11:31:14 and January 30th, 2014, at 12:38:31.

The data quality is not always perfect, with instances of obviously invalid location data (e.g., buses appearing in non-road areas) and instances where buses seem to freeze before suddenly reappearing in distant locations. To mitigate the impact of erroneous data, it is advisable to visually inspect the data for obvious errors using a visualization tool. We also restrict our dataset to include only measurements recorded between 7:30 am and 7:30 pm, as self-evidently erroneous observations tend to occur more frequently at night.

In this study, we focus on a specific area of the city, namely Princes Street in the Edinburgh city center. Princes Street is a central thoroughfare connecting the west and east of the city, and almost all buses crossing the city center follow a route that traverses at least a part of Princes Street. We analyze the traffic intensity along the street, particularly in the traffic-restricted area, and observe that the presence of pedestrianized zones affects the expected sojourn time in specific patches along the street.

We utilize hyper-Erlang parameters to construct a model for analyzing the case study involving trams in Edinburgh. Our model description and performance measures are based on utilizing the PRISM language, which is designed for modeling complex systems and evaluating their performance.

A key performance metric considered in this study is on-time performance, with a focus on whether a service is punctual according to the Scottish government's definition. We also investigate the impact of bus stops and traffic lights on sojourn distributions within specific patches along the route.

Ongoing developments in our methodology include generalizing the model to incorporate the movement of multiple buses contending for shared resources, such as access to bus stops, and developing an automated procedure for dividing a portion of a route into patches. This research is supported by the EU project Quanticol, with thanks to Bill Johnston of Lothian Buses and Stuart Lowrie of the City of Edinburgh Council for providing access to the data used in this study.

The visualisation tool used in this study was originated by Shao Yuan during his MSc work at the University of Edinburgh.

Additionally, a technical report in 2006 provides an overview of the use of AVL and automatic passenger counter (APC) data to improve transit performance, including case studies from various cities.
