Algebraic reconstruction techniques (ART) have led to advancements in various fields, such as medical imaging and electron microscopy, by enabling the reconstruction of distributions from projections. A key benefit of these methods is their flexibility in using different basis functions. Recently, spherically symmetric functions, known as "blobs," have been introduced as effective basis functions for reconstruction. However, the suitability of basis function parameters for reconstruction does not necessarily align with their effectiveness for visualization. In this paper, we propose a method for selecting blob parameters that are suitable for both reconstruction and visualization purposes.

In many cases, gaining insight into the internal structure of an object or body is challenging or impossible through direct observation. Nonetheless, information about the object's internal structure can be inferred from measurements resulting from its interaction with various types of energy.

While a higher value of the parameter "a" can further reduce errors, it comes at the cost of increased computational complexity. Additionally, this study does not consider resolution, which is another important factor. It is not necessarily the case, and may even be suspected otherwise, that parameters suitable for representing very smooth objects will result in high-resolution reconstructions. We will revisit this issue later in the paper.
