This academic paper introduces an escape analysis algorithm that draws inspiration from the one proposed by Gay and Steensgaard but offers greater precision. The algorithm's main objective is to provide valuable information for memory allocation using a region-based memory manager. It combines intraprocedural variable-based and interprocedural points-to analyses and is aimed at achieving a balance between precision and scalability, with a focus on practical applicability. The algorithm is exemplified through various typical programming patterns, and experimental results from an initial prototype on a few benchmarks are presented.

Several methodologies for escape analysis in Java have been put forward, most of which focus on stack allocation of objects and elimination of unnecessary synchronizations. Some works address bytecode, introducing additional complexity due to the stack-based model. There is also a proposal for a rapid yet cautious escape analysis based on solving a simple system of linear constraints derived from a static single assignment (SSA) form of the program.

In the context of region-based allocation in Java, two relevant works have been identified. One leverages method-call chains and escape analysis to dynamically map allocation sites to regions associated with methods, while the other defines a points-to analysis to identify regions of objects with similar lifetimes at an instruction-level resolution, in contrast to method-level resolution.

The described escape analysis algorithm focuses on providing valuable information for memory allocation using a region-based memory manager. It integrates intraprocedural variable-based and interprocedural points-to analyses and aims to achieve a balance between precision and scalability for practical application. It includes illustrative examples of the algorithm applied to typical programming patterns and presents experimental results from an initial prototype on a few benchmarks.

The paper's subsequent section elaborates on the escape analysis algorithm, assuming that the program is in static single assignment form (SSA) and detailing the algorithm's reliance on local variables instead of a complex points-to graph. The analysis is based on abstract interpretation and computes various properties for local variables and methods.

Fielduse is introduced as a mechanism demonstrating reference relations between local variables, useful when a variable escapes through a field. The analysis approach is designed to handle arbitrary portions of an application and employs a predicate to determine if a method requires analysis. The analysis process also addresses method parameters, matching formal and concrete parameters and considering dereferencing within methods.

Additionally, the paper mentions instrumenting benchmarks to enable a preliminary implementation on a test program, which demonstrated a 20% increase in total utilized memory when using garbage collection (GC) with a region-based manager compared to GC alone, despite only a 5% actual increase in region-allocated memory.

Furthermore, the paper discusses the analysis of a subgraph of the call graph for each test case, containing application methods and a subset of library methods invoked by the program. It emphasizes that the algorithm can be parameterized by the set of classes to be analyzed, allowing users to tune the analysis based on specific application behaviors.
