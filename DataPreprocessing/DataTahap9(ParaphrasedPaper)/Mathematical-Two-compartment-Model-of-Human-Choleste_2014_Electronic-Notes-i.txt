A liver biopsy, which is more intrusive than a standard blood test, could offer crucial insights into the underlying reasons for the disruption of cholesterol balance and guide further diagnostic procedures such as genetic testing for mutations in HDL and LDL receptors, as well as the main apolipoprotein components (such as APOA1 in HDLs and APOB in chylomicrons and LDLs).

Regulating cholesterol balance is a complex process that occurs at genetic, cellular, and tissue levels. Disturbances in cholesterol equilibrium, particularly elevated blood cholesterol levels, are associated with coronary artery diseases and are believed to contribute to 2.6 million deaths annually. Additionally, statins, which reduce de novo cholesterol synthesis, are the most commonly prescribed medications, highlighting the significance of cholesterol health. While numerous mathematical models have been developed to comprehend the glucose-insulin regulatory system, which is similarly complex and significant in the context of diabetes, modeling approaches to cholesterol balance are limited. Nevertheless, our two-compartment model demonstrates that investigating elevated blood cholesterol levels in a physiological and diagnostic context is achievable. We have illustrated that changes in blood cholesterol levels can be predicted by altering model parameters. Furthermore, we have shown the model's potential to explore various treatment strategies for lowering elevated blood cholesterol levels by reducing de novo cholesterol synthesis.

By presenting a relatively straightforward two-compartment model of cholesterol transportation and de novo synthesis, we aim to underscore the value of mathematical modeling in enhancing our understanding of cholesterol homeostasis and assisting in the diagnosis and treatment of life-threatening high blood cholesterol levels. Advanced models could not only aid in elucidating the interrelationships between the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis at the genetic, cellular, and tissue levels, but could also bring us a step closer to personalized medicine for preventing and treating high cholesterol levels. We have initiated the development of such an advanced model, initially by focusing on incorporating the gallbladder's aforementioned function.
