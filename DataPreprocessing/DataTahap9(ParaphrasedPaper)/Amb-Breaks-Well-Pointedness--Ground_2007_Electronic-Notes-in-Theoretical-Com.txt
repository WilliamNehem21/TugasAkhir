The primary issue stems from the concept of applicative bisimulation, which was initially formulated in the untyped context and subsequently investigated in the typed context. It was demonstrated that applicative bisimilarity is a congruence using a clever approach that is effective in both deterministic and erratically nondeterministic scenarios. However, as outlined in the document, this approach is not applicable in the presence of amb. Consequently, it is yet to be determined whether applicative bisimilarity remains a congruence in the presence of amb.
