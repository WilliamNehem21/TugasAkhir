Alice and Bob engage in the coloring game on a finite graph G, taking turns to properly color the vertices using a total of t colors. If at any stage there is an uncolored vertex without an available color, Bob emerges as the winner. The game chromatic number of G represents the smallest value of t for which Alice possesses a winning strategy. It is established that for forests, this number does not exceed 4. We aim to determine the precise values of the game chromatic number for a particular infinite subset of forests (comprising caterpillars) in order to make contributions towards resolving the open question of identifying forests with distinct game chromatic numbers. Additionally, we present two conditions that are sufficient for any tree to have a game chromatic number of 4, as well as two conditions that are necessary for any caterpillar to have a game chromatic number of 4.
