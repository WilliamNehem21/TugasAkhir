Amidst the ongoing research in formalizing the behavior of distributed components, the work done by the Sofa team is the closest to our objectives, akin to the Fractal component model. In the Sofa model, components consist of a frame (specification) and an architecture (implementation) for protocols. Verification is carried out by assessing the inclusion of the architecture within the target frame using a trace language. Alternatively, Carrez et al.'s work on behavioral typing of components establishes sound assembly and compatibility concepts to ensure the correctness of composition. However, this work is based on the CORBA Component Model (CCM) and lacks a hierarchy of components.

A few verification platforms for process algebras exist, with Sofa being the sole platform supporting behaviors of hierarchical components. Sofa incorporates a static analysis module based on the Java Path Finder tool and a proprietary model-checker that implements the Sofa compliance relation. Unlike our approach, which is based on trace language semantics, Sofa's approach does not support the congruent minimization of state space.

To address the issue of state-explosion at an early stage, we have integrated several hiding and abstraction techniques into ADL2N. Hiding allows users to selectively observe method calls, while data domain abstraction has been previously discussed.

We have defined parameterized FC2 as an instance of FC2, utilizing the extension mechanism of the FC2 syntax and introducing elements for parameters and operators. Although it is a textual format for compatibility reasons, it is not intended to be authored by humans. Its structured and compact nature offers the advantage that one parameterized model could be transformed using different instantiations at a later stage.

The parameterized network serves as the input for the tool FC2instantiate. This Java-based tool generates a finite system of communicating automata by translating each parameter to all values in its domain for a given system of communicating Label Transition Systems (LTSS) with parameters and the domain of its unbound parameters. The output is represented in FC2 format.

The LOTOS specifications of primitive components are compiled into LTSS using the Caesar tool of CADP. Additionally, the mapping of the names of the LOTOS gates and offers with the actions specified in the PNets is currently not automated by our tools and must be provided by the user.

The corresponding diagnostic utilizes breadth-first-search to find the shortest trace. We posit that our platform is capable of displaying more concise traces tainted by interleaved actions not related to deadlocks in comparison to those generated by Sofa.

We modeled the login method as void, signifying that no confirmation is sent back to the user with his new status, leading to the client logging in again. Upon analysis, a potential deadlock scenario revealed a realistic yet difficult-to-detect issue, which can be model-checked using this methodology.

It is noteworthy that this intriguing result was detected in a synchronous call context. A proactive implementation of the system with asynchronous services would not encounter such a deadlock. As our current version of ADL2N does not model asynchronous mechanisms, an analysis of this scenario is not yet feasible. We plan to address this limitation with the release of the new version of ADL2N.

The updated version of the ADL2N tool adopts a two-phases compilation process for ADL files. Initially, an abstract model that encodes the common semantics between different fractal implementations is created, followed by the addition of implementation-specific controllers depending on the selected component model.

Tools that directly handle certain classes of parameterized or infinite models are of particular interest. We anticipate exploring the connection with tools such as FAST or TREX from the Persee project. Integrating these techniques into our models is challenging but could enable the direct verification of infinite (yet regular) systems from parameterized models, thus overcoming state-explosion during instantiation.

While our platform is not yet fully developed, we view it as a step toward establishing a realistic automatic component verification framework. Although many intermediate formats are utilized during the process, our platform is evolving to streamline the manipulation of these complex languages by providing automatic or quasi-automatic tools. We aim to attract proactive users by offering valuable diagnostics for non-trivial design flaws.
