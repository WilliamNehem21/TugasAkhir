This academic paper demonstrates that modal logics for coalgebras defined in terms of an endofunctor t on sets can be naturally represented as functors l on boolean algebras. It explores the soundness, completeness, and expressiveness of coalgebraic logics from the perspective of duality theory. Specifically, given a logic l for coalgebras of an endofunctor t, the paper constructs an endofunctor l such that l-algebras offer a sound and complete algebraic semantics of the logic. The paper also establishes a relationship between the duality of l and t in terms of the axioms of l, providing a criterion for demonstrating the soundness, completeness, and expressiveness of given logics.

The paper further discusses the use of coalgebras as models for various state-based systems and the need for a general logical framework to describe and reason about their properties. It highlights the application of duality between coalgebras for an endofunctor on stone spaces and algebras containing the boolean signature, drawing parallels to the duality between descriptive general frames and boolean algebras with operators. The authors establish a duality of functors between an endofunctor t (on stone spaces) and a logic for t-coalgebras, leading to the development of a functor l (on boolean algebras) to provide a complete semantics of the logic.

Throughout the paper, set refers to the category of sets and functions, while stone refers to the category of stone spaces and continuous maps. The paper emphasizes that the theory presented is applicable to both coalgebras over set and coalgebras over stone spaces simultaneously. The key component is a functor that assigns boolean algebras to objects of the base category. Notably, the paper acknowledges that the definition of an order-preserving and-reflecting set of axioms given in the paper is slightly different from that in a previous work, but asserts that the proofs and arguments for proving soundness and completeness of the logic are still applicable under the weaker conditions outlined.
