To enhance the efficiency of wireless sensor network applications, the conservation of sensor energy is crucial for prolonging the lifetime of the network. In this study, a method called the cluster chain weight metrics approach (CCWM) is proposed to address the selection of cluster heads based on service parameters in order to improve the overall network performance. The objective is to not only conserve energy in the sensors but also balance the load within the network. The CCWM approach involves the selection of cluster heads based on a weight metric, followed by the formation of balanced clusters. Furthermore, a local clustering mechanism is adopted within each cluster to reduce computation and communication costs. Additionally, a new data transmission technique is explored. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed CCWM approach achieves an average improvement of 51% over LEACH, 27% over WCA, and 18.8% over IWCA in terms of network lifetime and energy consumption.

Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are deployed for environmental monitoring, involving the random or uniform placement of sensors to collect and transmit data to a base station. The unique characteristics of these networks pose several challenges, such as limited battery capacity, constrained hardware resources, massive and random deployment, and dynamic and unreliable environmental conditions. Recent advances in WSNs have led to the development of protocols specifically designed for energy-aware sensor networks. Most of the attention has been focused on routing protocols, as they may vary depending on the application and network architecture. At the network layer, the primary aim is to establish energy-efficient routes and ensure reliable data transmission.

The Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) is the first cluster-based routing protocol that selects cluster heads based on threshold criteria. In this protocol, cluster heads are rotated within a cluster to reduce energy consumption and evenly distribute the load among nodes. Cluster heads aggregate data from their member nodes and transmit the aggregated data to the base station.

An Optimized Weighted Clustering Algorithm (OWCA) is proposed based on WCA with additional constraints on cluster head selection in mobile WSNs. This algorithm takes into account various parameters such as node degree, transmission power, mobility, cumulative time, initial energies, and distance from the base station to each sensor node. Although this algorithm performs better than WCA, it incurs higher overhead in cluster head selection and ignores interferences in the network.

To ensure balanced load distribution among clusters, cluster heads are selected and rotated within the clusters. The relationship between cluster heads and routing techniques is also considered, and an integrated approach of cluster head selection and routing in a two-tier WSN is adopted. This integrated approach uses genetic algorithms for cluster head selection and the A-star algorithm for routing, resulting in significant improvements in network lifetime.

To address the issue of uneven energy distribution among nodes, a cluster head selection method is devised that limits cluster size and selects the best candidate node as a cluster head based on ranking metrics. This method also considers network service parameters such as residual energy, path loss factor, and node degree, with minimal overhead involved in cluster head rotation.

Various assumptions have been made for the implementation of the aforementioned methods, such as the possibility of nodes with higher energy being farther apart from each other, and the optimal cluster head position being at the center of the cluster. These assumptions guide the implementation of the cluster head selection algorithms.

A Cluster Head (CH) election procedure is invoked only when the residual energy of an existing cluster head is more than 75% of the residual energy of its member nodes. This has been determined through simulations by varying rounds against energy consumption patterns. The CH selection procedure is called when the residual energy of an existing cluster head falls below 1%.

The Cluster Chain Weight Metrics (CCWM) approach is designed based on each of the system parameters discussed above, incorporating specific weighting factors chosen according to the system's needs. The flexibility of adjusting the weight factors allows the algorithm to be applied to various networks. The output of the cluster head selection procedure will be the set of nodes with higher calculated values of position metrics. In this approach, only one node within its transmission range is selected as a cluster head, ensuring that no two cluster heads are immediate neighbors. In the event that two cluster heads have the same calculated value of the position metric, the cluster size would decrease, as nodes with larger transmission ranges cover a larger area. Consequently, the number of disjoint clusters formed would be reduced, resulting in a non-uniform cluster formation.

The CCWM approach consumes energy in a more balanced way compared to WCA and IWCA, as it uses short parallel chains for data transmission to the base station, resulting in more efficient energy consumption. Furthermore, a technique is proposed for cluster head selection that limits the node degree, reducing energy consumption and balancing the load. The application of a local clustering mechanism results in a 14% improvement compared to when no such mechanism is used, thus reducing network overhead and communication costs. Simulation results demonstrate that CCWM outperforms LEACH, WCA, and IWCA in terms of energy efficiency, load distribution, and network lifetime extension, making it suitable for real-time traffic applications.
