In this paper, we present a new framework for an intelligent recommender system, which builds upon the concept of a knowledge-based recommender system. The proposed intelligent recommender system leverages knowledge, learning, discovery of new information, inference of preferences and criticisms, among other capabilities. The framework of the intelligent recommender system consists of three main components: a knowledge representation paradigm, learning methods, and reasoning mechanisms. Additionally, the system incorporates five knowledge models, which cover various aspects relevant to recommendation, including users, items, domain, context, and criticisms. The interplay of these components enables the exploitation, updating, and inference of knowledge. We also implement an intelligent recommender system based on this framework using fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) and evaluate its performance with specialized criteria to assess the framework's versatility and effectiveness.

Recommendation systems have been developed using various techniques from domains such as artificial intelligence, data mining, semantic mining, and information retrieval. Traditionally, these systems have been categorized as content-based, collaborative, knowledge-based, and hybrid. We argue that a recommender system exhibits intelligent behavior when it possesses capabilities such as knowledge representation, learning, and reasoning, going beyond the simple exploitation of knowledge as seen in a knowledge-based recommender system. Based on these ideas, we introduce a new type of recommender system, the intelligent recommender system (IRS), which extends the capabilities of knowledge-based systems by incorporating learning algorithms, knowledge representation mechanisms, and reasoning engines. We define the components of an IRS, their relationships, and their application.

The paper includes a review of background literature on recommendation systems, theoretical foundations of the proposed approach, and a detailed description of the IRS framework. We also provide insights into knowledge models of the IRS, an implementation of the IRS using FCMs, and a case study to demonstrate the utilization and performance of the framework.

The proposed IRS relies on knowledge acquisition from various sources, including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data, and employs machine learning techniques for knowledge extraction. The IRS utilizes different types of knowledge, including extended user and item profiles, context and domain knowledge, critical knowledge, and domain-specific knowledge. We emphasize the importance of leveraging all available knowledge and incorporating advances from different domains to enhance the functioning of an IRS.

The implementation of our IRS can utilize various intelligent techniques, such as ontologies and evolutionary processes, based on the nature of the available information and supporting tools. In this paper, we demonstrate an implementation example using FCMs, which have been extended to incorporate fuzzy logic and neural network theories.

Our approach provides two levels of knowledge representation within the FCM-based IRS, capturing concepts related to user and item profiles, as well as contextual and domain-specific information. We also discuss the utilization of standards, such as IMS, for defining user and item profiles in the IRS.

Furthermore, we evaluate the learning and reasoning capabilities of the FCM-based IRS and compare our approach with other knowledge-based recommendation systems, emphasizing the management of knowledge and the effectiveness of the recommendation process.

Overall, our proposed intelligent recommender system framework offers an innovative approach to recommendation systems, leveraging advanced knowledge representation, learning, and reasoning mechanisms to enhance the recommendation process and address the limitations of existing knowledge-based systems.
