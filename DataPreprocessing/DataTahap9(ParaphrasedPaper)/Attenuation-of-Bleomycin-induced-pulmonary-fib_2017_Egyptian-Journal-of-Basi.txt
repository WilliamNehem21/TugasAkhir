Pulmonary fibrosis, a deadly progressive lung disorder, represents the end stage of various lung inflammatory conditions. Key features of pulmonary fibrosis include loss of alveolar structure, myofibroblast accumulation, remodeling of lung tissue, and excessive deposition of extracellular matrix.

Bleomycin (BLM), an antibiotic used in the treatment of lymphomas, testicular cancer, and carcinomas, has been found to induce significant functional and biochemical changes that promote pulmonary fibrosis. Microscopic changes induced by BLM include bronchial metaplasia, recruitment of reactive macrophages, atypical alveolar epithelial cells, fibrinous edema, and interstitial fibrosis.

Flavocoxid, a medical food regulated by the FDA and composed of two flavonoids, catechin and baicalin, is marketed for the management of osteoarthritis. It is the only prescribed anti-inflammatory agent that modulates cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes via anti-peroxidase activity and inhibits 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX)-mediated leukotriene production. Flavocoxid also exhibits strong antioxidant activities by down-regulating inducible inflammatory gene expression and neutralizing reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby preventing the conversion of arachidonic acid to oxidized lipids.

In a study, pulmonary fibrosis was induced in rats by intratracheal instillation of BLM. Rats received flavocoxid treatment for one week prior to BLM instillation and for an additional four weeks post-instillation. The study examined biochemical changes, histopathological alterations, and physiological pulmonary functions in response to BLM and flavocoxid treatment.

The study revealed that oxidative stress plays a crucial role in the development of pulmonary fibrosis, as evidenced by the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species. Previous research has implicated oxidative stress and aberrant antioxidant activity in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis in both animal models and human patients.

In the study, BLM instillation significantly disrupted the balance of oxidants and antioxidants, leading to elevated lung malondialdehyde (MDA) content, reduced glutathione (GSH) levels, decreased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and diminished total antioxidant capacity (TAC) in serum. BLM also increased lung nitric oxide (NO) content. These changes were associated with altered lung architecture and excessive collagen deposition, both of which are important features of pulmonary fibrosis. Flavocoxid treatment significantly ameliorated these histological alterations, reducing hydroxyproline and collagen depositions induced by BLM.
