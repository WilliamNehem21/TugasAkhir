Definition 2.2 defines an EBM (Evidential Bipolar Module) denoted as a directed graph with labeled pending edges, consisting of a finite set of propositional variables (hypotheses) and a non-empty finite set of conclusions. The set of propositional variables appearing in the EBM is noted as v(m). EBMs can be classified as initial, final, or transitory, based on the absence or presence of hypotheses and conclusions. The interface may be empty and is omitted when clear from the context.   
Furthermore, the translation from proof structures of ps to bms is governed by specific rules, including those dealing with the constant 1 and polarity. On the left-hand side of the relation, switched structures s' associated with the module on the right-hand side must be acyclic or connected, corresponding to the acyclicity or connectedness of the switched structure s.   
The proof relies on the bipolar nature of modules and may have considered minimal poles instead of maximal poles. Additionally, for each proof, only one of the two reduction rules is necessary. The same technique as used for Danos criterion can be applied to obtain a linear algorithm. Moreover, the extension of the technique to open modules is discussed in another paper as a necessary step towards the specification of a logic programming language based on bipolar modules.
