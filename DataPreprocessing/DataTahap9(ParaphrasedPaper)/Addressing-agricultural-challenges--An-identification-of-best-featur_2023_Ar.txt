This research utilizes various image processing techniques to preprocess real-time images of dragon fruit, followed by the extraction of thirteen features and the application of ANOVA and LASSO to rank these features based on mutual scores. Six different machine learning classifiers, including decision tree, random forest, k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), AdaBoost, logistic regression, and support vector machine (SVM), are then utilized on the top-ranked feature sets and evaluated using seven performance measures to gauge their effectiveness. The study includes a comparison of two feature selection techniques based on their performance results, with the aim of identifying the best technique for dragon disease recognition. Additionally, the computational cost of the feature sets is estimated to assess their significance. The main contributions of the research are outlined as follows:

The paper is structured into five sections, covering a brief introduction in Section 1, a literature review in Section 2, a description of the proposed method and materials in Section 3, an analysis of experimental results and model evaluation in Section 4, and a conclusion, limitations, and discussion of future work in Section 5.

Despite the widespread perception of dragon fruit as a healthy fruit, improper diagnosis has resulted in losses for many people who plant this fruit. To address this issue, researchers have turned to artificial intelligence and have proposed their analysis in an attempt to solve the problem.

Hakim et al. introduced a method for classifying dragon fruit based on their appearance (color and texture) using machine learning, working with three unique classes totaling 81 images. Doh et al. suggested a technique for disease identification in citrus fruits based on computer vision and machine learning, focusing on categorizing six different types of citrus fruit. They employed k-means clustering for image segmentation and integrated support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) into the image classification process. Local binary patterns and global color histograms were used as color features to classify papaya disease, achieving high accuracy. Mustafa et al. introduced a hybrid machine learning technique for diagnosing plant bacterial and fungal diseases and achieved high accuracy with different machine learning models. Syazwani et al. utilized contrast-limited adaptive enhancement to enhance captured images and achieved high accuracy in fruit crown classification using machine learning algorithms.

The study outlines several processes for classifying dragon fruit diseases and emphasizes the collection and preprocessing of field images, as well as the extraction of 13 individual features from each image using GLCM and statistical feature extraction. Anova and LASSO feature selection strategies were used to select the top 10 features. The selection of these features, along with the splitting ratio of train, validation, and test data, are also discussed.

The authors emphasize the importance of feature extraction and selection in reducing the dimensionality of data and improving the efficiency of machine learning models. Furthermore, they evaluate the performance of different machine learning models using various metrics and discuss the reproducibility of their work by making all datasets used accessible on GitHub.
