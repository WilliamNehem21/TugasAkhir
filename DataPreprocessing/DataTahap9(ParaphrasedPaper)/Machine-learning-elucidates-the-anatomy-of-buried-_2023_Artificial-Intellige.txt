The study utilized a supervised machine-learning algorithm to identify and characterize the features of a reef based on high-resolution 3D seismic data from the northwest shelf of Australia. The algorithm achieved a minimum nrms error of 0.28 and 0.30, with misclassification percentages of 1.13% and 1.06% for the train and test data sets, respectively. The creation of a reef cube meta-attribute effectively captured the buried carbonate reef's anatomy at a depth of approximately 450 meters, accelerating the interpretation process and reducing the need for human intervention. This approach has potential for efficiently delineating subsurface geological features from large volumes of surface seismic data.

Over the past decade, significant progress has been made in the processing and modeling of seismic data, leading to improved subsurface imaging. The study focused on delimiting the 3D subsurface architecture of carbonate reefs using high-quality 3D seismic data. This involved computing seismic attributes to characterize the reefs and then combining them into a hybrid attribute, termed the rc meta-attribute, using a machine learning algorithm. The presence of the meta-attribute within the data volume enabled automatic elucidation of the carbonate reef's anatomy with reduced human intervention.

Furthermore, the study discussed the shift in dominant sediment type on the northwest shelf from siliciclastic to carbonate during the Cenozoic era, as well as the development of a reef-rimmed carbonate platform in the browse basin during the early-middle Miocene period. Most present-day reefs in the basin and nearby areas grew on this extensive foundation of paleo-reefs and carbonate build-ups.

The use of structural filtering and labeled locations to train and test the neural model were also described. The study emphasized the importance of data conditioning to mitigate the impact of noisy or poor-quality seismic data on interpretation accuracy. The use of noisy data may lead to inaccurate example locations being fed to the network, reducing its learning capability and generalization efficiency, ultimately impeding the interpretation process. The study also highlighted the significance of the nrms error curve as a tool for evaluating the neural outcome's error performance.

Overall, the study presented a novel approach for accurately delineating the anatomy of buried carbonate reefs from high-resolution 3D seismic data, which has the potential to enhance the interpretation process and facilitate the identification of subsurface geological features.
