The concept of connecting logics has garnered significant attention within the fields of knowledge representation and ontology due to its intuitive semantics and natural support for modular knowledge representation, as well as its generality and robustness regarding decidability preservation. Despite this, there has been a lack of dedicated automated reasoning solutions, and the only available reasoning has been through translation into sufficiently expressive logics. In this paper, we introduce a straightforward modalized version of basic e-connections and develop a sound, complete, and terminating resolution-based reasoning procedure. This approach is modular and can be expanded to handle more expressive versions of e-connections.

We also note that e-connections have been widely employed for combining description logics, and experimental evaluation demonstrates that resolution performs effectively for such logics. We structure the paper as follows: in section 2, we outline the syntax and semantics of the multi-modal logic k(n); in section 3, we define a basic modalized version of e-connections; section 4 introduces the resolution method for connected logics, along with examples; and in section 5, we outline the correctness proofs. Section 6 discusses the results and related work.

E-connections were initially developed as a flexible and well-behaved technique for combining logics, but have been swiftly embraced as a framework for integrating ontologies and facilitating modular reasoning in the semantic web. The basic idea behind this combination method is that the interpretation domains of the connected logics are interpreted by disjoint vocabularies and interconnected through link relations. The language of the e-connection is then the union of the original languages enriched with operators capable of expressing the link relations.

We introduce a resolution-based calculus for cm, rese, which operates clausally: a formula to be tested for (un)satisfiability is translated into a normal form, and then the inference rules are applied until either a contradiction is found or no new clauses can be generated. The calculus includes inference rules to handle each of the component logics, as well as inference rules to deal with the connections between these components.

In addition, we outline the correctness results related to the resolution-based calculus for connected logics, rese, including soundness, termination, and completeness results for the method.

We conclude by highlighting the potential for extending the presented method to handle more powerful varieties of logic connections, including standard, classical normal modal logics, as well as other non-classical logics such as intuitionistic, relevant, or paraconsistent logic.
