The occurrence of prolonged hemorrhage during surgery can lead to complications such as decreased visibility and difficulty in the surgical operation. Monitoring bleeding is crucial for determining whether an endoscopic surgery should be halted. Several studies have focused on developing systems for automatic bleeding detection from endoscopic images, employing techniques such as deep learning, support vector machines, and analysis of RGB information. Some studies have also incorporated spatio-temporal information for improved accuracy in identifying bleeding sources and areas. However, challenges arise from the potential variability in the position of the bleeding source during surgery and the deformation of surrounding tissues by surgical instruments.

In this study, video data from a thoracoscopic operation on a pig was analyzed to evaluate the performance of a proposed method for bleeding detection using a new alert map (BAM) approach. The method achieved an accuracy rate of 90.5% in generating the alert map for bleeding sources. Additionally, it was noted that the use of a generator constructed with the help of pix2pix improved the accuracy and visibility of the alert map. The study also acknowledged the need for considering real-time performance and algorithm acceleration, especially with the increasing use of higher resolution endoscopes and the potential integration with virtual and augmented reality systems.

The authors also discussed the limitations of the proposed method, particularly its assumptions about the location of bleeding and the need for further development of mimicking devices to account for more complex bleeding scenarios. They proposed the future evaluation of the method in a clinical setting to assess its impact on hemostasis accuracy. The alert map was highlighted as a novel provision for bleeding state information, with potential applications in context-aware augmented reality and robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery.
