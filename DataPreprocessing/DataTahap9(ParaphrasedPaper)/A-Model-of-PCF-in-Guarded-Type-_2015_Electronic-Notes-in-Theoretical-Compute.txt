This paper focuses on a type theory that incorporates dependent types, natural numbers, inductive types, and guarded recursion. The presentation of the paper is informal, but the results can be formalized in gdtt, as explained elsewhere. The core of the type theory, as described in a prior work, is reviewed, and additional constructions are introduced as necessary.

Within the topos of trees model, the interpretation of the d modality is that dx(0)= 1 and dx(n+ 1)= x(n), meaning that from a logical perspective, the d modality postpones the evaluation of a proposition by one time step. For instance, if 0 represents the perpetually empty presheaf (which corresponds to a false proposition), then dn0 denotes the proposition that appears true for the initial n computation steps but then becomes false after n+ 1 steps.
