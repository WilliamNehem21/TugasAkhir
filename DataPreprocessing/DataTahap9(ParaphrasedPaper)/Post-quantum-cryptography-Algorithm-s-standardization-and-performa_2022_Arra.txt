The global competition among nations to achieve dominance in quantum technology is underway. This groundbreaking technology has the potential to significantly reduce computing time from years to mere hours or minutes, greatly benefiting the scientific community. However, it also poses serious cybersecurity risks, as practical quantum computers with millions of qubits could render most modern public-key cryptographic systems vulnerable to attack. As a result, there is a pressing need to explore tools, techniques, and deployment strategies to protect ICT infrastructure.

This paper delves into the comprehensive worldwide efforts focused on designing, developing, and standardizing various quantum-safe cryptography algorithms, along with an analysis of their performance. Many of these algorithms require increased CPU cycles, higher runtime memory, and larger key sizes. The goal of this paper is to examine the feasibility of these diverse quantum-safe cryptography algorithms.

Cryptography is a fundamental component of cybersecurity, involving the art and science of securing information such that it can only be interpreted by the sender and intended recipient. Most modern cryptography algorithms rely on complex mathematical functions and are designed based on assumptions of computational difficulty, such as asymmetrical problems like integer factorization.

The paper is structured into eight sections, starting with an overview of cryptography, followed by an introduction to quantum computers. The subsequent section discusses the issues surrounding post-quantum encryption, with an emphasis on the global efforts to standardize quantum-safe algorithms. Notably, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has spearheaded an extensive process to standardize post-quantum encryption algorithms. Furthermore, the paper examines potential quantum-safe algorithms announced by NIST during the third round of the selection process, along with the performance analysis of these algorithms based on the Open Quantum Safe (OQS) project implementation. The paper also addresses the overall observations, implementation feasibility, and challenges related to migration, concluding with a final remark.

Cryptography is utilized not only to secure data but also for ensuring confidentiality, authentication, integrity, and accessibility. It plays a crucial role in various aspects of daily life, such as providing secure internet browsing through SSL/TLS, facilitating digital signatures for authentication and validation, and enabling secure data storage.

In terms of cryptographic algorithms, symmetric cryptography algorithms involve the use of a single key for both encryption and decryption, while asymmetric cryptography algorithms use a pair of keys - a private key and a public key. The latter type is also known as public-key algorithms. Each type of algorithm has its advantages and vulnerabilities.

With the continuous growth in computational power, it is essential to modify cryptography algorithms to maintain their strength. However, the advent of quantum computing presents a new challenge, as a practical quantum computer could pose a significant threat to existing cryptographic systems.

Furthermore, the paper explores the activities of organizations such as the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) and the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), which are actively working towards the development and standardization of quantum-safe cryptographic algorithms. There is also an analysis of specific quantum-safe algorithms such as BIKE and Rainbow, along with potential challenges in their implementation.

It should be noted that the shift towards quantum-safe cryptography presents resource challenges, particularly in terms of increased CPU cycles and memory usage, which can impact ICT systems and devices. The paper also highlights the difficulty in proving the scalability and hardness of certain quantum-safe algorithms, such as lattice-based cryptography.

In conclusion, the impending era of quantum computing necessitates a proactive approach to developing and implementing quantum-safe cryptographic algorithms to safeguard against potential vulnerabilities. This remains an ongoing challenge, particularly in balancing scalability and hardness in algorithm design.
