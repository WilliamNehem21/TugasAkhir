The satisfiability problem remains a crucial unsolved challenge within computer science and serves as a fundamental problem in numerous scientific disciplines, including computer science, mathematical logic, mathematics, physics, chemistry, economics, and engineering. While approximations and heuristics are valuable in practical applications, it is concerning that there are many NP-complete problems that are essential in real-world scenarios. Identifying new NP-complete problems is relatively simple, as attempting to solve any of them and describing the main difficulty encountered can lead to the creation of a new problem. Despite this, removing a problem from the list of NP-complete problems is significantly challenging, as proving a problem to be outside the list would essentially render the NP-complete problem list empty, constituting a major achievement in the theory of NP-completeness.

The correctness of the algorithm is directly dependent on the results presented in Section 2 of the paper. It should be noted that the method approximates only the infimum, and the constraints mentioned in the previous section play a critical role.

In constructing the functions fi(x) and gi(x), it is evident that these are posynomials and linear posynomials, respectively. Furthermore, the positivity constraints of the variables can be easily adjusted to strict positivity constraints. Thus, the problem can be reduced to solving for positive xk only. The paper presents algorithms and procedures that are polynomial-time, but the practical correctness of these methods requires further investigation. Experimental verification is intended to confirm their correctness, though it is acknowledged that faults in the implementation of the optimization algorithms can lead to erroneous conclusions. The theoretical soundness of the algorithms and their prediction of polynomial-time performance are highlighted, but it is cautioned that theoretical investigation alone may not fully reflect practical performance, as evidenced by the ellipsoid method of optimization, which, while theoretically of polynomial-time complexity, exhibits poor performance in practice compared to the theoretically inferior simplex method with its exponential worst-case complexity.
