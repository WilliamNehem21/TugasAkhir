The rise in building energy consumption is linked to the increasing desire for a higher standard of living. Air-source heat pumps are commonly employed in buildings due to their low installation costs and ability to decrease energy usage by utilizing renewable energy. However, operating with a high-pressure ratio can lead to issues such as oil deterioration, which limits the safe operating range of the compressors. Moreover, compression irreversibility can result in reduced volumetric efficiency and system performance. Consequently, there is ongoing research focused on extending the efficient operating limits of heat pumps.

In recent years, vapor injection systems have garnered attention as a potential solution to the challenges associated with large compression ratios. Two-stage compression with vapor injection extends the operating temperature range by lowering the compressor discharge temperature, resulting in improved heating performance and coefficient of performance (COP). Studies have shown that vapor-injected heat pumps with R407c can effectively meet the heating needs of a family home with lower operating costs compared to oil heating systems. Additionally, vapor injection has a greater impact on heating applications than cooling applications and is particularly beneficial for the condenser.

The scroll compressor is the most commonly utilized compressor for this technology due to its ease of incorporation and the ability to adjust injection pressure by selecting the optimal port position. However, scroll compressors have limitations, and alternative compressor types, such as rotary and twin-screw compressors, have been explored in an effort to address these drawbacks.

Comparative studies have been conducted to assess the efficiency, volumetric efficiency, COP, and cooling capacity of various systems, including single scroll compressor with injection port (SCVI), two reciprocating compressors in series (TSRC), and two scroll compressors in series (TSSC). Results have indicated that each system exhibits different performance characteristics under varying pressure ratios.

The use of a flash tank in the intermediate stage of vapor injection systems results in temperature and specific volume reduction at the inlet of the second compression stage, known as de-superheating. This has effects on mass flow rate, compressor work, heating capacity, and COP, which have been extensively discussed in the literature.

The choice of control strategy also plays a crucial role in the performance of vapor injection systems, with model-based and model-free real-time control strategies showing promise under different operating conditions. Additionally, there is ongoing work to develop an optimal pressure control method applicable to different conditions and fluids.

Overall, vapor injection systems show significant potential for energy savings, particularly in extreme weather conditions, but challenges related to control strategies and system design need to be addressed to realize their full potential in practical applications.
