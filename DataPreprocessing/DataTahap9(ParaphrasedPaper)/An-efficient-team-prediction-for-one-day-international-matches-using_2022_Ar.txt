The selection of players for a squad is based on their past records and other considerations. When choosing the squad, a balance of batters, bowlers, and all-rounders is crucial, and the inclusion of a wicketkeeper with exceptional performance both behind the wickets and in batting is important. While fielding is important, the skills of batting and bowling are valued more than fielding.

The most potent team competing on a particular day varies, and there have been instances where lower-scoring teams have won by restricting their opponents to lower scores. It's also possible for a team to actively chase a high score.

When comparing statistics for players who have played against different opponents and performed similarly, it's crucial to consider specific details. For example, a player who performed well against a stronger opponent should be given a higher rating. This study focuses on developing a team forecasting model using classification and prediction approaches.

In machine learning, feature optimization is critical for handling high-dimensional datasets that contain duplicated, noisy, and irrelevant characteristics. Feature optimization helps reduce data dimensionality and select the most significant features to enhance performance and reduce computation costs.

The study explores swarm intelligence (SI), which represents social intelligence consisting of many self-organized agents. SI has been employed in large-search-space optimization problems, and the study examines ant colony optimization (ACO), particle swarm optimization (PSO), cuckoo search (CS), grey wolf optimizer (GWO), moth-flame optimization (MFO), and whale optimization algorithms based on natural agent behavior.

The proposed model aims to benefit players, teams, and coaches by providing insights on how to improve match outcomes. Additionally, the models are useful for sports analysis shows and news channels.

The rest of the paper is organized into sections covering literature review, data selection, machine learning methodologies, study findings, and discussion and conclusion. It includes references to previous studies on team formation, player classification, and winner prediction methods in cricket.

The paper discusses various approaches used in different studies, such as categorizing all-rounders, identifying rising stars, and selecting players based on their performance in batting and bowling. Additionally, it explores data extraction methods, such as web scraping, and the use of machine learning techniques for team prediction and player selection.

The study introduces a methodology for estimating cricket team performance based on features such as player-related performance variables and data pre-processing techniques. It also discusses the use of metaheuristics such as ACO and max-min ant system to form teams and predict star cricketers through supervised machine learning models.

The paper concludes with a detailed exploration of various aspects related to team formation and player evaluation methods, emphasizing the importance of feature optimization and the application of swarm intelligence algorithms in cricket team prediction.
