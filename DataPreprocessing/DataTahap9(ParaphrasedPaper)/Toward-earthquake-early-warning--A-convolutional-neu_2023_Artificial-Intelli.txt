A method for predicting earthquake magnitude, known as the peak ground motion displacement (PD) method, utilizes the maximum displacement at 2 seconds after the P-wave and the maximum displacement at 1 second after the S-wave to estimate the magnitude. Although this method provides a general indication of earthquake magnitude, it suffers from relatively large dispersion, leading to low accuracy of the results. While current methods can roughly calculate seismic event magnitude, they tend to have large dispersion, resulting in inaccurate predictions. As earthquake data accumulates, deep learning (DL) techniques are being widely adopted in Early Earthquake Warning (EEW) systems. Recent studies have shown that DL models for magnitude prediction in EEW can significantly reduce the error and variance of predictions compared to traditional methods.

For instance, Hu and Zhang (2020) designed and trained a DL model for magnitude range prediction in EEW, demonstrating improved prediction accuracy and variance reduction compared to traditional methods. Additionally, Lin et al. (2021) developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) magnitude prediction model using seismic waveform data, transforming the magnitude determination problem in EEW into a classification problem with promising results. Data augmentation techniques, such as adding slip and superimposed noise to generate new data, have proven effective in preventing model overfitting and improving prediction results.

Further, feature map dimensionality and network architecture play critical roles in the effectiveness of DL models for earthquake magnitude prediction. Normalizing data and incorporating non-linear activation functions, such as the ReLU function, have been found to improve model convergence and prevent overfitting. In addition, the use of transition modules to fuse and compress feature maps output from dense blocks, with a specified compression ratio, has demonstrated efficacy in improving model performance.

Experiments were conducted to verify the effectiveness of the EEWmagnet model for the magnitude warning classification task, focusing on the impact of seismic data normalization, epicenter distance features, and the multi-head attention structure on the classification of magnitude warnings. The results suggested that the EEWmagnet model achieved over 90% accuracy and recall rates, even with only 7 seconds of data. Furthermore, the study emphasized the importance of epicenter distance information and highlighted the potential loss of amplitude information from seismic waveform data due to normalization methods. The fusion of epicenter distance features was found to significantly improve classification accuracy.

In summary, this study makes significant contributions by proposing a deep learning network, EEWmagnet, which can rapidly and accurately classify seismic magnitudes using shorter waveform data. The study underscores the importance of incorporating epicenter distance information and highlights the potential adverse effects of normalization methods on magnitude estimation.
