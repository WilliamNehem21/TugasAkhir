The initial value u0 is 0.12345678901267. During the generation procedure, if the value of the Markov function f repeats, it is discarded, and the chaotic map iteration continues until all integers between 0 and 255 have been obtained. Consequently, f Markov serves as a vector utilized in a cryptographic system. The key parameters p, d, and r are assigned values of 29, 0.001, and 27, respectively, with the other parameters considered as the cipher keys. The proposed algorithm encompasses six keys: x0, y0, z0, n0, u0, and key0. The IEEE floating-point standard recommends computational precision for a 64-bit double-precision number.

In a plain image, pixels usually exhibit high correlation. An effective encryption system should significantly reduce the correlation between adjacent pixels to resist statistical attacks, achieving zero correlation as the ideal outcome for a cryptosystem. To evaluate this, 3000 pairs of adjacent pixels in horizontal, vertical, and diagonal directions are randomly selected from both the plain and ciphered images to calculate the correlation coefficients.

The proposed image encryption algorithm enhances security against differential, chosen-plaintext, and known-plaintext attacks, as a minor modification in the plain image yields a substantially different ciphered image. Moreover, the algorithm includes an effective diffusion process to alter the gray values of all image pixels. Experimental results and performance analysis, covering key space, histogram, correlation, information entropy, and differential attack, are presented to showcase the security and validity of the image encryption algorithm.
