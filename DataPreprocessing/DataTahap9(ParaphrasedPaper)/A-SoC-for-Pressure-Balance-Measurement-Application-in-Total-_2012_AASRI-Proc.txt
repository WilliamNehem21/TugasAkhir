The digital core of the system-on-a-chip (SoC) is built around the DW8051 IP core, which offers higher performance compared to the traditional 8051 microcontroller. The DW8051 IP core executes each instruction in a 4-clock bus cycle, as opposed to the 12-clock bus cycle in the traditional 8051. This microcontroller manages various digital blocks such as the MAC, SPI interface, ADC interface, and others by reading/writing special function registers (SFRs).

The SoC integrates a 4KB SRAM and a 256B SRAM, with the size of the SRAM being determined by the recognition task and the size of the program. Given that the size of the software is less than 4KB, a 4KB SRAM is used to store the software. Upon powering up, the system goes through an initialization process, and the boot-loader is executed to load the software from the EEPROM chip to the 4KB SRAM within the SoC.

A key component of the SoC is the FIFO memory, which serves as a buffer and facilitates flow control. A classical asynchronous FIFO is employed to safely transfer data from one clock domain to another. The FIFO design described in this paper utilizes 6-bit pointers with 32 writable locations to handle the full condition, and 4-bit pointers with 8 readable locations to handle the empty condition.

The SoC, designed for pressure balance measurement applications in total knee arthroplasty, is fabricated using the UMC18 CMOS process and has a die size of 3mm x 3mm. It integrates all necessary building blocks, including an RF transmitter, ADC, DW8051, ADC interface, MAC, MAC controller, boot-loader, SPI interface for EEPROM, multiplexer (mux), low-dropout regulators (LDOS), and a bandgap reference. This chip can be used to measure pressure in total knee arthroplasty applications and offers a high level of integration.
