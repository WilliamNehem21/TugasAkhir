The paper presents a translation of beta-binders into pi@, a dialect of the pi-calculus. Beta-binders is a bio-inspired formalism that allows the modeling of processes enclosed by boundaries, while pi@ features a prioritized action execution and composite channel names without the notion of enclosing compartments. The paper is structured as follows: it first provides an overview of the source and target languages, followed by a definition of the mapping and results regarding the operational correspondence between beta-binders processes and their encodings. The paper concludes with some final remarks.

The operational semantics of beta-binders is described by a reduction relation defined through axioms and rules, which form a subset of the beta-binders transition system. The complete semantics also includes specific axioms for joining and splitting boxes, actions that lack a direct syntactic counterpart in the language and are solely related to semantics. The translation is detailed incrementally, focusing on design choices step by step until refining into the full definition.

The translation process, documented in Table 4, is described incrementally, emphasizing crucial design choices in the step-by-step presentation. Additionally, the paper mentions that the shared private name 'g' is used as an identifier for the box and in the implementation of global communications.

The execution of a process called 'r' occurs either at the end of a protocol session or after the completion of hiding-unhiding activities. Similarly, if a binder is initially hidden, the corresponding handler 'bh' becomes available only after executing an unhide directive.

The paper establishes Theorem 4.3, which asserts that any reduction of [b] may lead to a rollback or encode a beta-binders process reachable from 'b' in a single step, with the result holding true up to structural congruence. It's noted, however, that the garbage collection axiom is unnecessary in the case of a rollback.
