This academic paper focuses on the importance of evaluating the similarity between trajectories of moving objects for various applications. Existing similarity measures typically define a specific meaning of similarity and propose algorithms for computing it. However, the authors argue that the meaning of similarity should be application-dependent and user-defined. Therefore, they propose a parametrized similarity operator, based on the time-warped edit distance, which allows users to define the meaning of similarity. The proposed operator is implemented in the open-source mod called Secondo and is evaluated using both synthetic and real datasets, with promising results.

The paper also discusses the significance of trajectory databases, which store and analyze historical movement data. The authors then provide an overview of existing similarity measures and their implicit definitions of similarity, highlighting the need for a user-defined approach.

The proposed similarity operator is based on the time-warped edit distance and is fully implemented in the Secondo mod. The authors elaborate on the flexibility of the approach and provide guidelines for setting the parameters based on dataset characteristics or user intuition. They also discuss the implementation of the operator in the context of database models and provide examples of the types of moving objects it can handle.

The authors present experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed operator, including evaluating similarity based on spatial routes and conducting a classification task using real GPS trajectory data. The results support the efficiency and flexibility of the operator, showcasing its ability to accommodate different representations of similarity meanings.

In conclusion, the paper highlights the importance of a user-defined approach to measuring similarity between trajectories and presents a parameterized similarity operator that addresses this need. The authors also identify future work, emphasizing the need for a similarity measure and operator that can evaluate similarity based on the continuous form of a trajectory.
