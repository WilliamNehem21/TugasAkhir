An implicit definition provides an axiomatization for a specific group of models, specifically a p-defined group of models for a given relation symbol p (refer to definition 2.1). Within the group of models of a theory that implicitly defines a symbol in the language, if two models sharing the same domain assign the same meaning to the other symbols, then they also assign the same meaning to the defined symbol.
