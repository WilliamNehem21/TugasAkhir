This academic paper revisits and enhances a previously introduced combination of the bialgebraic approach to structural operational semantics with coalgebraic modal logic. The main contributions of the paper are a more abstract and conceptual proof of the main compositionality theorem, as well as a more concrete understanding of the assumptions of the theorem. This understanding involves finding a syntactic distributive law between two collections of predicate liftings.

The paper also explains the process of deriving well-behaved transition systems from structural operational semantics specifications at the abstraction level of coalgebras in the bialgebraic framework. It introduces the concept of gsos as a type of distributive law between behavior and syntax endofunctors and highlights the compositional nature of LTS bisimilarity on gsos-induced specifications.

The paper addresses deficiencies in previous work by providing a more illuminating proof of the main compositionality result, offering an intuitive general understanding of coalgebraic behavior for logical formulas, and providing guidelines for finding behavior functors for logical formulas.

The structure of the paper includes a review of the bialgebraic approach to structural operational semantics and coalgebraic modal logic, a study of endofunctors, algebras, and coalgebras in slice categories of adjunctions leading to a proof of the main compositionality theorem, and an explanation of the theorem in terms of predicate liftings. The paper also touches on how the deficiencies in previous work persist to some degree in the current formulation. Some proofs are included in the appendix, and the paper may be of interest to readers beyond those focused on compositionality or structural operational semantics.

In summary, this paper aims to address deficiencies in previous work by providing a more abstract and conceptual proof of the main compositionality theorem, offering a concrete understanding of the assumptions of the theorem, and presenting a more intuitive understanding of coalgebraic behavior for logical formulas.
