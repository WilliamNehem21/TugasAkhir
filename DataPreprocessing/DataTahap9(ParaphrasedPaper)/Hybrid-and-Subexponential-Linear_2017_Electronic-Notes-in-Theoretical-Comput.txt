The paper introduces an encoding of Hybrid Linear Logic (HYLL) into Subexponential Linear Logic with quantification over locations (SELLA) to gain deeper insights into the semantic meaning of worlds in HYLL. The study concludes that previous attempts to encode Computational Tree Logic (CTL) operators into HYLL cannot be extended to cover the entire set of temporal connectives. The authors demonstrate the need for a system of Linear Logic (LL) with fixed points to accurately capture the behavior of temporal operators.

Several extensions of LL have been proposed to address this issue, including HYLL and SELLA. These logics have been widely used to specify systems with modalities such as temporal or spatial ones, with the primary distinction between HYLL and SELLA lying in the handling of modalities.

Furthermore, the paper proposes an encoding of HYLL into SELLA, which provides a more insightful understanding of the meaning of worlds in HYLL. It is shown that a flat subexponential structure is sufficient to represent any world structure in HYLL, revealing why the worlds in HYLL do not confer additional expressive power to LL. The paper also discusses the organization of focused proofs and the classification of formulas as positive or negative.

The study introduces the notion of monopoles and bipoles in LL formulas, outlining the admissibility of weakening, contraction, general identity, and cut theorems. The encoding of HYLL inference rules into SELLA is also presented, highlighting the flat subexponential structure required and its lack of reflection of the order on worlds.

It also discusses the implementation of formal proofs in HYLL using the Coq proof assistant and suggests extending these implementations to SELLA for a comprehensive interactive proof environment enabling formal studies of encoded systems in SELLA and meta-theoretical study of SELLA itself.
