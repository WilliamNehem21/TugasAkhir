The capacity of a segment of a railway system is defined as the maximum number of trains that can operate on it within a specific time period, such as an hour or a day. The theoretical expression for the capacity of a railway line in a given direction, denoted as "c", can be defined as "c = 1/h," where "h" represents the minimum headway time between two successive trains. The minimum headway time is contingent on the signaling system installed on the considered line. More accurate expressions can be employed to encompass additional features of the rail system.

Originally, constraint programming (CP) models aimed to address feasibility problems by finding assignments to variables that satisfy a set of constraints. These models were later extended to handle optimization problems by using the value of the objective function to set upper or lower bounds on a variable. This is achieved by introducing a new constraint on the variable once a feasible solution is found.

In this paper, we have presented a CP model for a real-time train scheduling problem, which has been applied to the Pierre Tte-Gonesse junction. The main components of a signaling system are reviewed, followed by the formulation of the CP model. Subsequently, we demonstrate how this CP model has been adapted to address the train saturation problem described in section 1.

The previous CP model was initially designed to solve real-time train management problems and has now been modified to address the saturation problem. Based on the definition in section 1, the decision variable "sta(t)" is replaced by variables "stt(i= 1)." In real-time problems, trains can experience delays during their journey. Conversely, in a saturation problem, an additional constraint is introduced to ensure that train movements through the junction are not delayed.

Furthermore, we define the function "fr" for feasible routes. Due to the large size of the scenarios considered, a complete search was found to be impractical within a reasonable timeframe. Consequently, the set of feasible routes was restricted to a single route, with the route variable set to the "usual" route for each train category.

As mentioned in section 3.2, experiments with the CP model revealed that a complete search using a prospective algorithm for scenarios with more than 12 trains was not feasible within a reasonable timeframe. Instead, a greedy algorithm was developed, incorporating constraint propagation algorithms available in ILOG Solver/Scheduler libraries following each decision step on the "sta(t)" variables. This algorithm utilized specific notations to accomplish its tasks.

Due to the considerable size of the instances considered, a variation of the metaheuristic GRASP (Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure) was employed. This metaheuristic, originally proposed by Feo and Resende, entails a two-phase approach involving a construction phase to generate an initial solution and a subsequent local search phase to refine these solutions. GRASP has been successfully applied to various optimization problems in different domains.

This method has demonstrated its utility in solving challenging combinatorial optimization problems, particularly those related to set covering and set packing. Moreover, a construction procedure and a local search procedure were defined to build and improve solutions, respectively.

Preliminary conclusions drawn from the results suggest that, for a combination of freight and TGV categories, considering alternative routes is necessary to preserve capacity. Additionally, when inter-city trains are combined with other categories, the start variable takes precedence over the route variable. These conclusions are supported by the results of the TGV/FR scenario, which showcased the effectiveness of the USPP model in optimizing the number of trains with careful route selection.
