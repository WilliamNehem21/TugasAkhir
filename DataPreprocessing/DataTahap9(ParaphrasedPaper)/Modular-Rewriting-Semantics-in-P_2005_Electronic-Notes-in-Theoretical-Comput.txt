The proof that a methodology is effective can be demonstrated through persuasive case studies, as the practical application of a methodology needs to be shown. Two examples, namely the GNU BC language and a rewriting logic semantics of concurrent ML, are discussed here to illustrate different applications of the methodology. 

In the case of the GNU BC language, which is a subset of C tailored for numerical computation and is part of the Linux distribution, the practical use of the methodology is exemplified with a real yet medium-sized language. Another case study highlighting the use of the methodology involves a rewriting logic semantics of concurrent ML. 

The record of semantic entities in the context of the proposed methodology includes two fields: a trace of actions and an environment storing the context of (possibly recursive) definitions of process names. The trace component utilizes a list of actions from the "action-list" module, while the environment component utilizes sets of process definitions, called contexts, defined in the "ccs-context" module. The Maude syntax for actions, processes, and contexts adheres to existing conventions. 

Abstract sorts and functions play a crucial role in the methodology, as they enable flexibility to modify concrete representations in language extensions without necessitating changes to the semantic rules. An illustration of this concept is presented through the extension "units.maude" for the BC semantics, which allows annotating a BC program with information about the physical units it manipulates. This extension involves changing the concrete representation of stores, whereby they now map a location to a pair consisting of a concrete numerical value and an abstract unit value.

In the context of an empty environment and store, the evaluation of the BC program "print(x + y);" results in an output of 0 but a unit of "fail" due to the undeclared units of x and y. However, by using the annotation "assume" (not shown in the example), this fail unit can be avoided, and the actual result would depend on the specified unit algebra.
