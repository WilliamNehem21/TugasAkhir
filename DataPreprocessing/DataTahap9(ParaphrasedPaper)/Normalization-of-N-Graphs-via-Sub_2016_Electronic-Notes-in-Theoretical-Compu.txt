In his doctoral thesis, Alves introduced a normalization procedure for n-graphs, a formalism for multiple conclusion natural deduction in propositional classical logic developed by De Oliveira in 2001, using directed graphs to represent proofs. Here, we propose a new normalization method for n-graphs, drawing inspiration from A. Carbone's work in 1999, which involved a combinatorial model for studying proof evolution during the process of cut elimination.

The system is similar to proof-nets and involves the concepts of proofgraphs and n-graphs. Proofgraphs are used as the building blocks for constructing graphs, with valid links connecting nodes representing premises and conclusions. N-graphs, on the other hand, are a subset of proofgraphs that represent valid proofs. These constructions are analogous to the definitions of proof-structure and proof-net, respectively.

Alves's normalization procedure for n-graphs, as presented in his thesis, was influenced by the work of Statman, Blute, and others, who developed graphical and topological frameworks for studying the normalization of natural deduction. Alves's procedure consists of two stages: the first stage deals with general proof-graphs, such as trees and specific cycles, while the second stage provides a comprehensive treatment of cycle structures. This procedure involves four sets of transformations that eliminate maximum formulas/segments, along with an algorithm (named 3ca) designed to determine whether a cycle has a detour or not.

The procedure includes operations for creating new vertices and links based on premises and conclusions in the proof-graphs. It is shown that each reduction yields another n-graph gj from the original n-graph g, with the validity of the reductions demonstrated through the theorem 3.5. The normalization theorem is proven by induction on the degree of the cut formulas, the number of cuts with maximum degree, and the number of inversions of maximum/structural segments. The reduction process decreases the number of inversions or removes a maximum formula from the n-graph, validating the theorem. The choice of reduction order ensures that the degree of the formula in the vertex is always reduced, facilitating the application of the reductions.
