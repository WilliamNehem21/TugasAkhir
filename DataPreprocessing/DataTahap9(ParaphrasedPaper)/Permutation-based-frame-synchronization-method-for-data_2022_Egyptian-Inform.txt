Several approaches have been suggested for synchronizing codeword frames without relying on syncwords. For instance, a previous study introduced a method that involves buffering two frame lengths of symbols and attempting decoding at each possible offset until a successful decoding offset is found. However, this method is more computationally complex and is not as effective as frame synchronizers that make use of syncwords.

This study proposed using a permutation as a syncword, where the minimum Hamming distance to all its circular shifts is maximized. Additionally, a correlation processing of data fragments from the communication channel was introduced to detect the syncword, and interleaving of accumulated fragments was used to expedite synchronization convergence. To assess the permutation-based frame synchronization method, a Python software model was developed.

In the analysis, it was found that the probability of false synchronization increases with a higher probability (p0) and a lower accumulation factor (l). In such cases, the frame synchronization procedure should ensure that the likelihood of establishing false synchronism does not exceed a given threshold for any arbitrarily high probability of a bit error.

If synchronization is not achieved in a given step, the receiver accepts new fragments and stores them in a general buffer. The fragments are then distributed randomly between sets, a process referred to as interleaving, as the random distribution can be achieved by interleaving fragments in a common buffer array.

The paper introduces a permutation-based frame synchronization method for data communications with short packets, where the binary representation of the permutation used as a syncword must satisfy the condition that the minimum Hamming distance to all its circular shifts is maximized.
