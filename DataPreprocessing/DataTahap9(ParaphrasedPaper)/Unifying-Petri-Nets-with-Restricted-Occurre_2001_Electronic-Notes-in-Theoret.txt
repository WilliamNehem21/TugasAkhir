The paper discusses the restrictions on the occurrence of transitions in Petri nets. It introduces the concept of concurrent composition and the role of information elements in encoding these restrictions. The paper emphasizes that the enabling condition of the occurrence rule may be limited or complex, involving inhibitor arcs, capacities, and other approaches such as positive context. It also mentions the unification of different classes of Petri nets using various underlying algebras and treatment of data-type parts, highlighting that the enabling condition is fixed in some approaches while others allow for more complex restrictions. Furthermore, the paper suggests using more complicated algebras to describe these restrictions.
