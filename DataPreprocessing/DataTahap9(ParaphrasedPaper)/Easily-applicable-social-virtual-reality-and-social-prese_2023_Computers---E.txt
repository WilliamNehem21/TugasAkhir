Social virtual reality (VR) platforms have become increasingly popular in recent years, offering users a sense of social presence and the potential to enhance social interaction in distance education. However, there is limited insight into how VR enhances the social aspects of learning, and previous studies have mainly focused on the effects of short-term usage of custom VR learning applications. To address this gap, the current qualitative study sought to explore the potential of implementing off-the-shelf social VR environments in distance education. In this study, 35 master's students utilized the AltspaceVR platform for university seminars and group work over a six-week period during campus restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Subsequently, 23 participants were interviewed to gather their perceptions of the technology. The results indicated that social VR facilitated feelings of social presence, promoted natural and spontaneous communication with peers and teachers, and fostered a greater sense of community in the classroom compared to traditional videoconferencing. The participants expressed high acceptance of the technology for teaching and learning tasks, particularly for interactive activities in small groups. However, they also identified limitations such as image resolution, lack of note-taking tools, and feelings of dizziness and fatigue after prolonged use. These findings underscore the potential benefits of social VR for enhancing the social dimensions of online education, as well as the challenges that need to be addressed to enable its effective use in higher education.

The study focuses on the potential of social virtual reality (VR) applications in distance education, recognizing the limited existing research on this topic, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting social needs among students. The study integrated a VR classroom, implemented using the AltspaceVR platform, into the teaching activities of a master's course in communication science over a six-week period, aiming to evaluate the impact of this technology on a relatively large group of students. The technology utilized for the study was modern VR headsets, such as the Oculus Quest and HTC Vive Cosmos, which are increasingly accessible to the public. The study highlights the potential of social VR for enhancing social presence, communication between students, and feelings of connectedness and community in the context of distance education.

The findings emphasize the positive impact of social VR on students' feelings of social presence, communication, and community in the virtual classroom. While the study provides valuable insights into the potential benefits of social VR in education, it also identifies technical limitations, such as image resolution and dizziness/fatigue after prolonged use, and the need for further research to understand the individual antecedents that may determine different effects of social VR among students. Limitations of the study include the examination of only one social VR platform and one group of students in a single course, suggesting the need for future research to explore the unique effects of different social VR platforms and to analyze other aspects such as privacy concerns and potential negative effects of social VR.
