This paper introduces an upgraded version of the subsexpl tool, named subsexpl 2.0, which simplifies the process of defining new calculi in both de Bruijn and named notations. This enhancement enables users to experiment with their own calculi, simulate reductions and normalizations, export LaTeX code, and utilize other features not available in the original implementation.

While some of the challenges related to explicit substitutions calculi have been resolved, important properties of calculi remain unknown. For example, it is still unclear whether the suspension calculus preserves strong normalization (PSN). Furthermore, there is practical interest in developing an explicit substitution calculus in de Bruijn notation that simultaneously satisfies specific properties. Recently, a calculus of explicit substitutions that meets the desired computational properties has been developed.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides a detailed description of the new version of subsexpl. Subsection 2.1 presents an example of defining a new calculus in named notation, while Subsection 2.2 introduces a calculus in de Bruijn notation along with the well-known counter-example of Mellies. In Subsection 2.3, the paper illustrates some educational applications of the system. Finally, the paper concludes in Section 4.
