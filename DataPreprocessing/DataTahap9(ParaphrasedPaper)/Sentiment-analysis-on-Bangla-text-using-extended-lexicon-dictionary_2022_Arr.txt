This academic paper focuses on predicting sentiment in Bangla text using a combination of rule-based and lexicon dictionary approaches, as well as several hybrid deep learning models. The paper introduces a rule-based algorithm called BTSC, which generates scores from text using a categorical weighted lexicon data dictionary (LDD). Additionally, the paper describes the use of word embedding models in three-dimensional space (128d, 200d, 300d) to train the deep learning models and presents hybrid novel deep learning models such as hierarchical attention-based LSTM (HAN-LSTM), dynamic routing-based capsule neural network with bi-LSTM (D-CAPSNET-BiLSTM), and bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) LSTM.
The paper provides a structured overview of the research, discussing the survey of sentiment analysis using deep learning, methodology, detailed experiments, performance results, and concluding remarks. It also explores various deep learning architectures such as long short-term memory network (LSTM), bidirectional LSTM, asymmetric convolutional bidirectional LSTM (AC_BI-LSTM), recurrent convolutional neural network (RCNN), and gated recurrent unit (GRU). The paper delves into the benefits of applying hierarchical attention network (HAN) and BERT to sentiment analysis tasks and discusses the use of sentiment lexicons and linguistic rule-based approaches in Bangla text analysis.
Detailed descriptions of the various deep learning models used in the experiments are provided, including the strategies for word embedding, recurrent neural network mechanisms, and the implementation of capsule neural network models. The paper discusses the impact of attention mechanisms, the use of pre-trained BERT model, and the performance improvements achieved through customizing and fine-tuning hyperparameters for individual models. The study identifies the challenges posed by the low-resourced Bangla dataset and the need for balanced training data to enhance prediction accuracy. Furthermore, the paper outlines future research directions, proposing the use of memory-augmented networks, transformer models, word embedding learning representations, and graph neural networks to further improve emotional sentiment analysis in the Bangla domain.
Overall, this paper presents a comprehensive investigation of sentiment analysis in Bangla text using deep learning models and provides insights into the challenges and potential avenues for future research in this area.
