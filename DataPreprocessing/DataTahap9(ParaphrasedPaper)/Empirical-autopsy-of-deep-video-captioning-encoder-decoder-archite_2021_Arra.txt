The study evaluates and measures the impact of using different CNN architectures for feature extraction in video captioning. Five CNN models with varying depths and structures are analyzed, and it is observed that networks with stronger expressive capabilities perform better. The authors empirically demonstrate that the choice of CNN model in video captioning can lead to performance improvements. 

Recent methods have introduced modifications in the encoder-decoder framework, such as the multi-model memory proposed by Wang et al. to model long-term visual-textual dependencies, the frame picking module proposed by Chen et al. to select a compact frame subset for video representation, and the use of short Fourier transform by GRU-EVE to enrich video representation with temporal information. Additionally, Zhang et al. and Zheng et al. have explored techniques for modeling salient objects with temporal dynamics and incorporating a syntax-aware action targeting module, respectively. It is important to understand the contribution of each module in the encoder-decoder architecture for accurately assessing the overall framework performance.

The experimental setup used in the study divides the video captioning framework into four key components: the CNN model for encoding visual features, feature transformation for preparing inputs for the language model, word embeddings for numerical representation of words, and the language model for decoding visual features into natural language descriptions. Various experiments were conducted by modifying methods for each component and analyzing the overall captioning performance.

The study used the MSVD dataset to perform experiments, which consists of 1,970 short video clips with human-annotated captions. Evaluation was carried out using metrics such as BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, and CIDEr to comprehensively assess the quality of automatically generated captions.

The role of CNN architecture in the video captioning framework was found to follow a similar trend to that seen in image classification tasks. It was observed that deeper networks tend to perform better, with networks like VGG-nets and Inception-ResNet-V2 exhibiting improved performance. The study also revealed that temporal encoding provided a significant positive impact on performance.

In the encoder-decoder framework, word embeddings were shown to play a crucial role in caption generation, with pre-trained embeddings demonstrating significant performance improvements compared to random initialization. Additionally, the depth of the language model was found to be important for effective learning, with higher layers capturing semantic information.

The study also investigated the impact of hyperparameters and model fine-tuning on captioning performance, providing insights that can serve as guidelines for training effective captioning models.

Overall, the study demonstrates the significance of CNN architecture and its impact on video captioning performance, emphasizing the importance of informed selection of visual feature encoding models and word embeddings for achieving significant performance improvements.
