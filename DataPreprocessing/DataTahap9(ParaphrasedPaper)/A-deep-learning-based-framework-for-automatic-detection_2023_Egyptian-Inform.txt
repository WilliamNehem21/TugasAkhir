Each year, a significant number of individuals are afflicted with tuberculosis (TB), resulting in a high mortality rate among patients [1,2]. It is estimated that there are approximately 8 million new TB infections annually, leading to 2 to 3 million deaths each year. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the causative agent responsible for TB, primarily affecting the lungs, although it can also impact other areas of the body such as the spine, brain, and kidneys. The occurrence of tuberculosis can be attributed to two main factors: active TB disease and latent TB infection (LTBI), with untreated cases often resulting in fatality.

There are notable challenges in accurately diagnosing TB patients, particularly in distinguishing between multidrug-resistant (MDR) and drug-sensitive (DS) cases, each requiring distinct treatment approaches. Additionally, it is difficult for TB specialists to identify the specific type of TB in an infected individual, as there are overlapping symptoms across the various TB types. To address these diagnostic complexities, early determination of a patient's TB condition and classification of the TB type are crucial for reducing treatment costs and improving recovery rates.

Existing studies have focused on TB detection using 3D CT scans or chest X-ray images, emphasizing the significance of image masks for enhancing deep learning model accuracy. Many researchers have leveraged pre-trained models, such as AlexNet, VGGNet, and ResNet, for feature extraction, with several studies drawing from the ImageCLEF competition dataset.

A study utilized a 7-layer CNN, including conv2d layers, to classify images into bacillus-negative and bacillus-suspect categories, incorporating a cascade of classifiers to enhance model confidence. Singh et al. utilized an anti-aliased CNN for TB lesion detection in lung CT images, aiming to identify abnormal regions using image segmentation. Another study experimented with three networks to classify drug resistance in TB patients, with the dual attention dilated residual network (DADRN) demonstrating superior performance using CT images.

Ravi et al. employed pre-trained neural networks, including EfficientNetB0, B1, and B2, to detect lung diseases based on chest X-ray images, achieving high accuracies in classifying pneumonia and TB cases. Ying et al. focused on classifying patients with nontuberculous mycobacteria pulmonary disease (NTM-PD) or pulmonary TB (PTB) using the T-spot test and deep learning models, reporting improved outcomes through a combined approach.

The study utilized the ImageCLEF-2018 tuberculosis dataset, housing 3D CT images in NIfTI file format (.nii.gz extension). Several neural networks were explored, with VGG16 utilized for feature extraction, highlighting the need for additional information, such as image masks and age/gender data, to enhance classification accuracy. Consequently, multi-modal deep neural networks were proposed for MDR detection and TBT classification, leveraging CT images, image masks, and age/gender data as input modalities.

In conclusion, the paper discussed the development of deep neural networks for MDR detection and TBT classification, emphasizing the importance of multi-channel or multi-modal systems in improving diagnostic accuracy. As future work, the authors recommended expanding the dataset size and investigating neural networks capable of handling 3D images directly. Additionally, exploring alternative image modalities, such as X-rays, was suggested for future research.
