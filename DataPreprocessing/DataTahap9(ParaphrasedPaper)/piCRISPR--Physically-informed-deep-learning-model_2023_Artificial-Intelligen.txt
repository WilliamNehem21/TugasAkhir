To ensure maximum transparency and comparability, we utilized guide-target pairs from the crisprsql dataset maintained by our research team. This dataset consists of 17 instances of off-target cleavage studies on sp-cas9, encompassing 25,632 data points, making it larger than most datasets currently used to train prediction algorithms. The dataset includes information on various cell lines, predominantly u2os, hek293, and k562. For our analysis, we utilized version 26/05/2020 of the database, excluding t-cell data from lazzarotto et al. to prevent introducing a significant imbalance in cell line representation. Additionally, as our focus is on off-target datasets, we did not evaluate our modeling on on-target datasets due to differences in experimental techniques and cleavage quantification measures.

When our off-target detection method did not detect cleavage at a genomic locus meeting certain criteria, we assigned a cleavage activity of zero to that point. This resulted in a highly imbalanced complete dataset, totaling 310,142 guide-target pairs. Following the convention in the literature, we referred to this process of increasing the number of data points as data augmentation. Specifically, we concentrated on 251,854 data points derived from a human cell line or synthetic human DNA for this study.

Furthermore, we intend to enhance the epigenetic information of the guide, which currently only mirrors the epigenetic information of the target DNA. This represents an unrealistic choice. Since a synthetic sgrna does not naturally carry epigenetic markers, a one-hot encoded dot-bracket representation of the sgrna folding would be more appropriate for capturing its informative properties.
