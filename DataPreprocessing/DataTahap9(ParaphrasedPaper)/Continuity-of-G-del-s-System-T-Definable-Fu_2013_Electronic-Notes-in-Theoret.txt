Previous research has explored the concept of computing continuity information by applying a function to effectful arguments. Longley introduced the idea of passing exceptions to the function, while a similar approach is discussed in an example presented by Bauer and Pretnar.

This paper provides a comprehensive and self-contained proof in MLTT (Martin-LÃ¶f Type Theory) notation, developed from scratch. Since MLTT proofs are essentially programs, we can utilize them to calculate the moduli of uniform continuity for T-definable functions. Furthermore, since MLTT has an interpretation in ZF(C), where types are considered as sets in classical mathematics, the results presented in this paper also extend to classical mathematics.

To demonstrate the constructive nature of the formal proof, the paper presents some experiments. These experiments are not intended to showcase the practical utility of the theorem, but rather to illustrate that the theorems have concrete computational implications.
