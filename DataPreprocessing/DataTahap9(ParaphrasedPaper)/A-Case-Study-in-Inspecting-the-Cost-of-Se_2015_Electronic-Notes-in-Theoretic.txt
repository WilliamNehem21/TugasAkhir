The increasing demand for business services and the competitive landscape has led many enterprises to outsource their service provision using cloud computing in order to handle business processes and data management. While cloud computing offers numerous benefits including accommodating increased demands and providing cost-savings, there are potential security concerns associated with its usage. This paper proposes a research approach to investigate the cost of security in cloud computing. The proposed method involves using a multi-level security model to distribute partitioned workflows across hybrid clouds, and then creating a cost model using the PEPa Eclipse plug-in tool to evaluate the performance and cost of deployment under various options and scenarios.

In recent years, cloud computing has become an attractive option for many organizations due to the increasing capabilities of outsourced solutions and the high costs of owning and maintaining infrastructure. Organizations can harness the advantages of cloud computing, such as high performance, availability, scalability, and cost-effectiveness, to cope with their growing business processes and data requirements. However, the deployment of workflows on internal resources (private cloud) may impact service performance due to resource limitations, while public cloud computing can alleviate these limitations and offer high performance at a reduced cost.

Despite the benefits of cloud computing, security concerns have been a significant challenge, especially regarding the storage and confidentiality of organizational data. As a result, many organizations consider using a combination of public and private clouds based on data sensitivity to balance security and performance. This paper aims to investigate the cost of security for deploying partitioned workflows in cloud computing, using a multi-level security model and a cost model generated by the PEPa Eclipse plug-in tool. Additionally, the paper proposes a new cost model to evaluate different distribution possibilities for deploying partitioned workflows on federated clouds.

Several previous studies have also addressed cost modeling in cloud computing from various perspectives. Mach and Schikuta introduced an economic cost model for cloud providers and consumers, focusing on server energy consumption. Nada et al proposed a technique for partitioning BPEL workflows automatically to improve performance and reduce communication costs. Furthermore, Dillon et al and Leinwand discussed the additional costs associated with using a hybrid cloud distribution model and the specific cost of data transfer in cloud computing.

To evaluate the performance of multi-core systems in the cloud, Cerotti et al conducted experiments using various benchmarks on different platforms. Additionally, Adriansyah et al emphasized the importance of modeling business processes and performance analysis. While their approach shares similarities with the proposed research, the focus of this work is on the cost analysis in cloud computing and the evaluation of performance of the modeled systems.

The proposed research will involve investigating workflow modeling languages, such as YAWL and BPEL, to develop a new cost model for deploying partitioned workflows over hybrid clouds and conducting extensive experiments to simulate the performance behavior of workflow activities. Moreover, the paper presents several deployment options for partitioned workflows, highlighting the trade-offs between public and private clouds in terms of performance and cost.

In conclusion, the paper presents initial work on modeling workflow deployment using PEPa and aims to explore the costs associated with different security decisions in cloud computing. While the model has limitations, such as not modeling data transfer costs, it demonstrates the potential for providing insights into system behavior and the costs of various deployment options. The paper emphasizes the need for further development and validation of the proposed approach against real-world implementations to demonstrate its practical value.
