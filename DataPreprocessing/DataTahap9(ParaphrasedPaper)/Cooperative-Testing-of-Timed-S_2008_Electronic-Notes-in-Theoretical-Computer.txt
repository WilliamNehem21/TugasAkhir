In this study, we assume that the behavior of the implemented system (referred to as "imp") can be represented using a model termed "tiots i," which shares the same sets of input actions (actin) and output actions (actout) as the specification "tioga s." We designate the initial state of the implemented system as i0 and the initial semantic state of the specification as s0. If i0 conforms to s0, we denote that the implemented system is a correct implementation of the specification, denoted as i tioco tiots(s). Additionally, we make the assumption that the implemented system is deterministic and can be controlled.

Our objective is to perform targeted testing to verify whether the implemented system adheres to the specification, and for this purpose, we employ a test purpose. In this paper, we utilize annotated timed CTL formulas to express test purposes. For example, the expression "control: a<> bright" denotes that regardless of the uncontrollable outputs generated by the plant according to the specification model, the controller can always choose to trigger input transitions or to delay such that the system is ensured to reach the goal location "bright." In a more relaxed scenario, we express "e<> control: a<> bright," indicating that we can be guided to reach "bright" as long as the plant is willing to cooperate with the controller by producing outputs in a desired manner.
