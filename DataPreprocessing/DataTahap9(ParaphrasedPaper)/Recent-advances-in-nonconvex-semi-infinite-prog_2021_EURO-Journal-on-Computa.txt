The aim of this review is to provide an overview of recent advancements in semi-infinite programs (SIPs) over the last two decades. It covers different solution approaches and algorithms, focusing on deterministic algorithms for SIPs without assumption of convexity, particularly when the constraint function is non-concave with respect to parameters. The article also discusses the advantages and disadvantages of various algorithms, highlights recent SIP applications, and concludes with a discussion on remaining challenges and future research directions.

Specifically, it surveys solution approaches for SIPs with nonconvex lower-level problems, which establish feasibility of a point in a SIP by globally solving the lower-level problem, either explicitly or implicitly. Additionally, it outlines recent algorithmic approaches to nonconvex semi-infinite optimization and illustrates their applicability to modern SIP applications. It also discusses recent advances in the area, particularly in the solution of generalizations of SIPs, and mentions some applications of SIP and bilevel optimization in parameter estimation in mixture thermodynamics.

Moreover, it points out that while the paper focuses on smooth and continuous nonconvex lower-level problems, semi-infinite constraints also arise in more general settings, such as with nonsmooth defining functions and/or with mixed-integer variables. It states that the development of theory and methods for SIPs with nonsmoothness/integer variables is still in its early stages.
