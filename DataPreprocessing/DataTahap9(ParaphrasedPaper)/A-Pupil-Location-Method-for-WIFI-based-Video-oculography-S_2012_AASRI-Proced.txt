Video-oculography (VOG) is a widely used method for measuring eye movements. One of the main challenges in VOG is accurately determining the center of the pupil. In our recent work, we have developed a wifi-based VOG system and proposed a pupil location method that utilizes morphology and the canny algorithm to address this issue. To evaluate the effectiveness of this method, we conducted a sinusoidal tracking test with a healthy volunteer, and the experimental results demonstrated that the method effectively tracked eye movements and produced the expected results with stimulation.

VOG is gaining popularity due to its high accuracy, minimal artifacts, non-invasiveness, and the ability for subjects to move their heads freely. The accurate estimation of the pupil center is a critical aspect of VOG analysis. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to introduce a nystagmus analysis system based on wifi that we developed and to propose a pupil location method based on morphology and the canny algorithm. Subsequently, we conducted an experiment to assess the efficacy of this method.

In our study, we utilized opening and closing operations, where opening involves erosion followed by dilation and closing involves dilation followed by erosion. These operations serve to smooth the contour of binarized images, break narrow gaps, fuse narrow breaks, eliminate small holes, and fill gaps in the contours.

The paper presents a wifi-based video-oculography system and a pupil location method based on morphology and the canny algorithm. The method was evaluated through a sinusoidal tracking test with a healthy volunteer, and the results confirmed that the proposed method effectively met the expected outcomes.
