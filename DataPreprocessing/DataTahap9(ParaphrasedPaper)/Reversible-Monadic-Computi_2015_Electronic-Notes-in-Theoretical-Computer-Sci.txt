The emergence of quantum computing brings attention to the fact that the deterministic evolution of quantum bits is reversible, unlike the measurement process which transforms quantum information into classical information. An additional characteristic of quantum computing is the inability to copy or delete quantum information, leading to a resource theory based on linear types rather than classical types. Quantum computing is semantically framed within monoidal categories, rather than cartesian ones.

This paper extends the categorical semantics of monadic programming to reversible computing, drawing inspiration from quantum computing. To facilitate a linear type theory, the study considers monoidal closed categories, and to accommodate reversible computations, dagger categories are utilized. The concept of frobenius monads is introduced to incorporate monadic effects, where a frobenius monad interacts with its corresponding comonad according to the frobenius law. Although graphical proof calculus to simultaneously reason about morphisms in a monoidal category and endofunctors is lacking, traditional commutative diagrams are still necessary alongside the graphical calculus.

The discussion involves building on previous research on frobenius monads, using monads as semantics for quantum computing, incorporating daggers into reversible programming, and combining daggers and monads in various contexts. Notably, the paper takes a systematic approach from first principles and intends to incorporate probabilistic programming in future work.

Furthermore, the paper explores the connection between frobenius monoids in the category of finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces and their correspondence to finite-dimensional C*-algebras, emphasizing their significance in quantum computing and as semantics for labeled Markov processes and operational semantics of probabilistic languages. Additionally, it delves into the relationship between kleisli algebras and their role in providing semantics for computations with effects modeled by a monad. Notably, when the monad is a frobenius monad, the category of its kleisli algebras becomes a dagger category, allowing for the addition of effects without departing from the framework of reversible computations as long as the monad satisfies a natural condition regarding cooperation with daggers.
