The basic variant of p systems involves the evolution of objects based on evolution rules associated with compartments. These rules transform multisets of symbols within the compartments. The interaction between compartments is facilitated by allowing the movement of objects between directly nested membranes through evolution rules. These rules are typically applied in a non-deterministic maximally parallel manner, where the rules and objects to be evolved are randomly chosen, and all objects capable of evolving must do so at each step.

Several formal results have been achieved, including the investigation of the computational power of two basic brane calculi proposed in. A variant of p systems inspired by the interactions of a basic brane calculus is also examined. Additionally, a parallel semantics for brane calculi, inspired by the maximal parallelism semantics of p systems, is considered. Furthermore, two variants of p systems with interactions inspired by the two basic brane calculi are studied in detail.

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces the formal notions necessary for the subsequent discussions. Section 3 explores the modeling of mobile membranes communication with phago/exo/pino actions. Finally, in Section 4, some concluding remarks are presented, along with perspectives for future work.

In the context of living cells, the primary function of a biological membrane is to define a compartment and its interaction with the surrounding environment, including other compartments. This concept of membrane structure is utilized in both p systems and brane calculi, where the membrane serves as a logical separator between processes and resources. The membrane structure can be likened to a tree-like structure, a Venn diagram, or a correctly matching parentheses string, and it allows for nested membrane structures. The height of the tree corresponds to the depth of the structure.

Biological membranes are composed of a lipid bilayer that behaves like a fluid, enabling structural components and embedded substances, such as proteins, to move freely within the region delimited by the lipid layers. Membranes are situated in an aqueous solution and can float freely within this fluid environment. This fluid-within-fluid structure directly inspires the basic structure of brane calculi, which involves two commutative monoids with a replication operator, each representing a type of fluid.

The phago/exo/pino brane calculus (abbreviated as pep) is defined by three actions inspired by biological processes: endocytosis and exocytosis. The endocytosis process comprises two specialized actions: phagocytosis (phago), which involves a cell engulfing exactly one external membrane, and pinocytosis (pino), which engulfs only external fluid without any membranes. The exocytosis process is represented by the exo action, which involves the reverse process of endocytosis, where a single internal membrane irreversibly mixes with the external one while expelling its contents outside of it.
