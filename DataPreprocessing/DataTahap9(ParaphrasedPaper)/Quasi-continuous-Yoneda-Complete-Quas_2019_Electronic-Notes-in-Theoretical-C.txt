The concept of quasi-continuity in domain theory is central to the study of quasicontinuous dcpos, which possess many properties similar to those of continuous dcpos. This paper seeks to define quasi-continuous yoneda complete quasimetric spaces and explore the necessary and sufficient conditions for their posets of formal balls to be quasi-continuous dcpos. We demonstrate that the proposed definition generalizes that of continuous yoneda complete quasimetric spaces and establish that the poset of formal balls of a quasi-continuous yoneda complete quasimetric space is itself a quasi-continuous dcpo. In addition, we provide a converse result under certain conditions.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 outlines the relevant definitions and basic results related to the hyperspaces of quasi-metric spaces. Section 3 investigates the properties of the formal balls of quasi-continuous yoneda complete quasimetric spaces, presenting a main result that characterizes these spaces using particular quasi-continuous dcpos of formal balls. Section 4 delves into the hyperspace of finitely-generated subsets of a quasi-metric space and demonstrates its role in characterizing quasi-continuous yoneda complete quasimetric spaces, representing the second main result of the paper. Section 5 concludes the paper.

The paper also discusses the notions of hemi-metric and quasi-metric spaces, providing references for further reading on these topics. We illustrate examples of quasi-continuous yoneda complete quasimetric spaces, including cases involving continuous yoneda complete quasimetric spaces and quasi-continuous dcpos. Additionally, we cite WÄ…s-Wiedmina's work on interpolative mappings in the context of continuous yoneda complete quasi-metric spaces, drawing parallels to the quasi-continuity of yoneda complete quasimetric spaces and their formal balls.
