Several notations such as AADL, Rapide, and AID aim to offer a (semi-)formal modeling framework embedded within an intuitive and expressive design language. AID, specifically, stands out due to its capability to define various inter-process communications (IPC) as inherent features of the language, enabling concise and reusable system specifications.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces the basic concepts of the non-timed Architecture Interaction Diagrams (AID), which is extended in this paper to create a timed design language called Timed Architectural Interaction Diagrams (TAID) in Section 3. The formalism is illustrated with two examples of timed inter-process communication. Section 5 presents related work, and Section 6 concludes the paper.

Buses are crucial elements in the AID paradigm, acting as transducers that convert transitions of connected components into system-level transitions. They are responsible for data transfer between senders and receivers, as well as the synchronization of sender/receiver transitions.

The set of links, denoted as L, connects component ports with bus ports, and the formal definition of links may be referenced for further details. The paper highlights the basic intuition behind links and gates for the purpose of understanding.

The modeling of time passage is separated from system interaction to ensure maximal progress and time determinacy. Additionally, the paper includes a discussion of these issues in Section 2.3.

For each instant of time, the bus checks if the reader or writer has timed out, transitioning to an error state if either party is no longer interested in the communication initiated.

Rule 3 defines the behavior of the bus when the reader or writer times out or completes the handshake. The bus transitions to an error state if the original parties have timed out and, otherwise, completes the handshake.

The put logic in the FIFO system checks if there are simultaneous writes to the same location at the same time, preventing the entry of colliding values into the FIFO.

The definition of "tick" allows the associated time value to become negative, indicating that data has propagated from the head to the tail of the FIFO but has not been read and removed. In case of multiple data values with negative time values, the one with the minimum time value is prioritized for reading.
