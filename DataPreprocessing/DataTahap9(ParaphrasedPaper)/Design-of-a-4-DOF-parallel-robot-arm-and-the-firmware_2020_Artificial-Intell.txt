The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a publicly available firmware framework primarily intended for creating robotic applications. It comprises multiple libraries capable of executing advanced tasks like guiding robots, coordinating multiple robots through machine vision, and integrating sensors. Araujo et al. (2015) designed a mobile robot platform utilizing an Arduino board controlled by ROS, enabling precise control of the manipulator's linear speed trajectory. The manipulator's smooth actuation was maintained by initiating acceleration at the start and deceleration at the end of the trajectory. Once the manipulator arrived at the target position, a signal was transmitted through a serial bus to trigger the next cycle in conjunction with the platform.

This platform converted the rotation of a stepper motor into linear motion along the z-axis, with a parallel jaw gripper affixed to the robot arm at the connection point of two passive links. The gripper was operated by a servo motor to open and close, while another servo motor on the passive link facilitated the gripper's rotary motion in planner coordinates. Four limit switches were deployed at the robot arm frames to serve as sensing boundaries, with two switches (1 and 2) detecting the boundary position of the active robot joints, and switches 3 and 4 identifying the upper and lower boundary positions.

The developed firmware was effectively implemented on embedded hardware to execute the picking and dropping of potted seedlings loaded on a feeding conveyor using a parallel robot arm, achieving an average cycle time of 3.5 seconds and a success rate of 93.3%.
