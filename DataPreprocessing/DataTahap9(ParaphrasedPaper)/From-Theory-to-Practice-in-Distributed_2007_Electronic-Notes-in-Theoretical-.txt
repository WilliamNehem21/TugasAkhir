This presentation will commence by discussing theoretical findings regarding determinism in asynchronous distributed components. The practical application of these findings will also be demonstrated, as it has been made available as open source within the objectweb open source community. Additionally, ongoing efforts to define a joint European component model for grid computing (GCM) will be outlined. Lastly, the challenges associated with component systems, particularly those related to capturing behavioral properties, will be addressed. The presentation will also introduce current work aimed at defining behavioral models and techniques for hierarchical components.

Within the GCM, collective operations that were previously implemented at the level of objects are now being abstracted into elements of the interface. This transition represents a significant achievement in terms of readability and reuse. Furthermore, functional methods can now be utilized in various contexts, including standard non-collective code and powerful group interactions. Additionally, this approach raises the level of abstraction used by programmers and enables typing of collective behavior. 

From a historical perspective, the transition from a hierarchy of modules to objects and now to components may seem like a step backward in programming evolution as components introduce a more static topology. Previously, the interconnection between pieces of code was often purely dynamic with objects, but components now entail static interconnection. This can be mitigated by introducing dynamicity only through designated entities within the architecture, such as binding controllers. This presents components as dynamic entities under control. Furthermore, the typing of interfaces, as seen in remote method invocations, is crucial for verifying large systems, as it provides guarantees offered by a static type system. The absence of unstructured callbacks and ports makes a significant difference in verifying a component system.
