The focus of this study is on the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in a robotic upper limb exoskeleton system. The paper introduces a novel electromyography (EMG)-based online shoulder motion recognition and control system, which connects the online signal sensation system and robot motion control system using LabVIEW software. The authors aim to develop a computer system that can sense muscle activation patterns and process multiple channels of EMG signals for upper limb exoskeleton motion control to assist with activities of daily living (ADL). The paper provides detailed information on online data acquisition, signal processing, system connection, and compares the difference between offline analysis accuracy and online performance accuracy.

The authors state that while EMG signals have been explored for robotic upper arm control based on neuromuscular characterization, challenges persist due to the complexity of the musculoskeletal system of the upper limb. They note that most literature has focused on hand/wrist control with fewer degrees of freedom (DOFs) compared to the shoulder joint, making the bionic control of an upper-limb exoskeleton more complex. The study aims to address these challenges and develop a reliable system for intuitive control of the robot to positively impact human strength augmentation and the rehabilitation process.

In a study involving 7 healthy subjects, the authors report that a neural network (NN) yielded an accuracy of up to 88.7% during the training process, while a support vector machine (SVM) obtained an accuracy up to 85.9% in model validation. Another study involving 15 healthy subjects using EMG signals from 12 muscles of the upper limb showed that a convolutional neural network (CNN) obtained a recognition accuracy between 79.64% and 97.57%, with accuracy affected by motion speed and the devices used for EMG signal recording.

The authors describe the steps involved in the real-time EMG recognition process, including EMG signal acquisition, feature extraction, machine learning model generation, and online recognition and motion control. They reported that three machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression (LR), SVM, and artificial neural network (ANN), achieved an accuracy ranging between 71% and 98% for upper limb motion pattern recognition and exoskeleton motion control in real time. SVM outperformed ANN and LR in real-time motion pattern recognition and motion control, with a focus on shoulder/upper limb exoskeleton intuitive control for ADL.

The study's limitations include a small number of recognized motion patterns, trajectory-based motion control, and the use of 12 EMG modules to recognize four discrete actions of ADL. The authors suggest that future work will focus on developing a better computing system for wearable sensor-controlled upper-limb exoskeleton systems and determine the minimal number of EMG sensors for optimal performance.

In conclusion, the study demonstrates the feasibility of machine learning in processing multiple channels of EMG signals for real-time shoulder motion pattern recognition and wearable exoskeleton motion control.
