The subjective nature of user-perceived software quality presents a challenge for measurement, particularly in user-centric web-based systems like e-commerce platforms. Despite this difficulty, the importance of assessing software quality in these systems cannot be understated. This paper aims to address the question of how one can measure subjective software quality. The use of metrics is presented as a powerful tool for evaluating quality, but to effectively leverage these metrics, guidelines for their use are necessary. The paper introduces a model based on metametrics that suggests which metrics should be utilized and how they should be applied when evaluating e-commerce systems.

The extended model proposed in this paper offers a set of metametrics specifically tailored for evaluating metrics used in e-commerce systems. These metametric values form a framework for the proper use of these metrics, ultimately enhancing the reliability and accuracy of the evaluation process while reducing costs and measurement bias. The framework is not designed to identify the best metric, but rather to provide guidance on which metrics to use in validating different aspects of an e-commerce system. The unique contribution of this research lies in the development of a theoretical framework that represents a step toward a better understanding of the appropriate use of external metrics.

The assessment of metrics for business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce carries significant weight, particularly in ensuring the high quality of services to drive user retention on websites. Various processes and metrics have been proposed to measure the quality of e-commerce systems, and by evaluating the performance of these processes, different business strategies and tactics can be implemented. Web design strategies and models propose diverse metrics to support the success of e-commerce systems and assess their quality.

The paper focuses specifically on metrics applied to e-commerce systems from the end-user perspective, such as the number of colors used or the number of clicks required to access product descriptions. Since these metrics pertain to web-based applications, they are referred to as web metrics.

While an array of web metrics categories exist, none besides those in the referenced paper are specific to e-commerce. Relevant proposals addressing web systems measurement include those concerning web usability and usability guidelines. Moreover, a wide range of general web metrics have been introduced, with some authors suggesting over 250 web metrics. Additionally, a web classification framework has been proposed for enhancing web information access and use.

Typically, metrics are evaluated using measurement theory and empirical data, which are best suited for internal metrics. The use of meta-metrics for evaluating metrics presents a novel approach. Similar approaches have been introduced for assessing popular internal metrics of software, but to the best of the authors' knowledge, there are no other works that utilize meta-metrics to measure external metrics of software, particularly web applications.

The proposed meta-metrics are utilized to evaluate e-commerce applications based on specific performance characteristics of the metrics themselves. These characteristics are divided into ten categories, representing the meta-metrics. While this categorization provides an evaluation of metrics, the aim is not to critique the actual value of the metrics.

The subjectivity of user perception of quality is a critical consideration concerning external metrics, as different users may interpret metrics differently due to various factors. The framework incorporates ten different meta-metrics that cover different aspects of the measurement procedure, including measurement independence, accuracy, cost, evaluation, and target.

In summary, this paper presents a step toward the qualitative measurement of e-commerce systems using metrics. It offers an adaptable tool beneficial for evaluation experts and developers, underscoring the potential for more effective measurement of e-commerce system quality.
