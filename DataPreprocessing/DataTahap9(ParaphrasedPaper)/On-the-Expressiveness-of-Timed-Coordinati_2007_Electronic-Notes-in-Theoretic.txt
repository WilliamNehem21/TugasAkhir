This paper extends its investigation to the integration of time into multiset-based coordination languages, focusing particularly on the depiction of time in a relative manner. The study employs a two-phase functioning approach to real-time systems, as exemplified by languages such as Lustre, Esterel, and Statecharts. This method involves the execution of elementary actions or statements in a first phase, assumed to be instantaneous, followed by the progression of time in a second phase when all actions are completed or when a special timed action is encountered.

The introduction of time in coordination-like languages has mostly been explored within the context of relative time languages and variants of Linda languages. For example, a method is proposed to introduce time in the concurrent constraint setting by identifying quiescent points in the computation and introducing an operator to delay computations by one unit. The framework is further expanded by introducing a primitive for checking the absence of information and reacting to this absence during the same unit of time, as well as generalizing the delay mechanism. The resulting languages are named TCC and TDCC.

Other research has focused on the expressiveness of timed constraint systems, examining extensions of the TCC languages with replication and recursion static scoping. The paper presents results regarding decidability and encodings, which differ from the modular phased embeddings used in this study.

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: section 2 introduces the two families of languages under study, section 3 presents the framework for comparing language expressiveness, section 4 explores the expressive power provided by introducing communication primitives in each language family, and section 5 compares the two language families. Finally, section 6 concludes the study.

For the purpose of comparison, the paper defines a notation m(x) to denote the language obtained by restricting multiset rewriting pairs to component-wise multiset unions of pairs associated with the communication primitives of x. Pre-conditions are specifically concerned with the presence or absence of tokens on the store, regardless of their duration. The paper also introduces the notation of phased embedding, demonstrating the success of coding a primitive with a delay of one unit at time 2.

In summary, this paper investigates the expressiveness of two timed extensions of coordination languages, both based on the two-phase functioning approach to real-time systems and incorporating relative time. The first family is built on a set of Linda-like primitives, while the second relies on multiset rewriting, as previously employed in the gamma language.
