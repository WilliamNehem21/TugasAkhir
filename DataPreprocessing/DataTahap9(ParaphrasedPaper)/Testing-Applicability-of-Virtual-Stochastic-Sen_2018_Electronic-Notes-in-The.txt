The field of non-intrusive appliance load monitoring (NIALM) aims to interpret household appliance electricity consumption using only cumulative consumption data collected from a smart meter. Various approaches, including different types of hidden Markov models (HMM), have been proposed for NIALM. However, most of these approaches do not explicitly consider the duration of an appliance's activation. This paper explores whether virtual stochastic sensors (VSS) can effectively address the NIALM task and evaluates the reconstruction accuracy using the publicly available smart* dataset. The study automatically extracts models of household appliances with varying inherent states from the appliance data and assesses the reconstruction accuracy of a combined model on the cumulative energy consumption data. The experiments demonstrate that VSS can achieve a reconstruction accuracy of up to 90% with suitable method parameters, indicating that VSS can compete with existing NIALM approaches.

Given the dwindling reserves of fossil fuels and the growing energy demand, there is a pressing need to address future energy market strains. While developing alternative energy sources is one approach, another viable strategy is to focus on energy conservation, not only in industry but also in private households. To enable this, consumers must first understand their consumption patterns.

VSS were developed to reconstruct hard-to-obtain measures of interest from measurable quantities where the relationship is not an explicit analytical expression but can be represented by a discrete stochastic model, such as a hidden non-Markovian model (HNMM). The study conducted a master's thesis to test the applicability of VSS and HNMM to NIALM, successfully building and applying models with up to three states per appliance and non-Markovian state holding times, achieving competitive reconstruction accuracy. This paper serves as a summary of the thesis and points to future research directions to offer a general approach using VSS for NIALM.

The subsequent sections will discuss related and previous work on non-intrusive appliance load monitoring and virtual stochastic sensors. Then, the paper will delve into the case study of NIALM through VSS using the smart* dataset. The experimental section will evaluate the capabilities and limitations of the approach, followed by conclusions and an outlook.

Applying VSS to the non-intrusive appliance load monitoring problem holds promise for several reasons. HMM and related modeling paradigms have been effectively applied to NIALM, and HNMM enables the modeling of explicit state holding times, thus improving accuracy for NIALM. Additionally, the method does not inherently limit the number of states per appliance, allowing for realistic load modeling and reconstruction.

The smart* dataset contains circuit-level energy consumption data, where a circuit can represent a single appliance (e.g., dryer, duct heater) or a set of appliances (e.g., master outlets, kitchen lights), treated interchangeably in the following context.

The individual appliance state Petri net (ASPN) models were combined into one ASPN representing the complete set of household appliances with their usage states and respective energy consumption behavior. Each appliance model contained a token to represent the current state of the appliance. The state space of the model is the set of currently active states of the different appliances, represented in the marking of the ASPN through the distribution of the tokens.

The emissions of the currently active tangible appliance states were aggregated to yield a cumulative energy consumption. However, the large size of the combined model, containing 25 consumers or circuits with three to seven states each, resulting in over 3e11 possible discrete model states, posed computational challenges for processing even one step of the decoding algorithm.

The reconstruction accuracy of the path was 0.95 for measure 1 and 0.78 for measure 2, with the degradation in version 2 attributed solely to a decrease in reconstruction accuracy of the dryer states. Overall, the test demonstrated the possibility of reconstructing energy consumption from cumulative data using VSS.

For the chosen test day, a longer trace length of 3,600h to 36,000h improved the accuracy and practical value. However, a trace length of several days did not further enhance accuracy, and trace lengths of 3,600s and 36,000s were considered for the performance experiment.

Most appliances could be reconstructed with an accuracy of 0.9 or better, with the master outlets and the duct heater showing the least accurate reconstructions. This was likely due to the extremely noisy data produced by the duct heater, making it inherently challenging to reconstruct. Additionally, the noise could not be accurately represented in a three-state model, suggesting that a model with more appliance states for the duct heater could improve its reconstruction accuracy, an area for future research. The master outlets represent a variable set, where the actual appliances used may have differed from the training to test data, presenting another avenue for future exploration.
