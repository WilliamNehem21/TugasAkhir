In this scholarly article, the notation t[u:= v] is used to represent the term obtained from t by replacing all non-conflicting occurrences of u with v. The size of a term, denoted by |t|, is defined using structural recursion. Additionally, a formula is considered to be a term of type b.

The forthcoming section of the paper outlines the design space for our subsequent calculus in terms of saturatedness conditions. The underlying concept is that if a collection of formulas adheres to these closure conditions and no obvious contradiction is observed, then it must indeed be satisfiable. This important result will be expressed as a theorem on the existence of a model.

The paper extensively explores the object-level within our system. Although our constrained rule of replacement sheds light on the limited capability of the identity predicate in MFI1, the question persists regarding the possibility of establishing local termination criteria for such a calculus. In existing literature, the argument often posits that involvement of identities raises similar challenges as in K over transitive frames, where formulas need to be transmitted along a chain of successors.
