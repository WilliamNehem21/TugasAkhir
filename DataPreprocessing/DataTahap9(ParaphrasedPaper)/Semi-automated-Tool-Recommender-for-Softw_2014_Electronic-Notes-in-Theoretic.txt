In this academic paper, the authors present a domain-parametric recommender system for assisting with tool selection in the context of Application Lifecycle Management (ALM). The recommender system takes into consideration the specific domain, process definition, and evaluation criteria to produce a ranked list of recommended tools. A prototype of the approach was developed and tested in the context of the testing domain, yielding recommendations similar to those provided by testing experts. The authors highlight the advantages of their approach, such as the ability to quickly filter through a large number of tools based on a reduced set of criteria and the ease of adapting tool recommendations to changes in the development process. The paper also outlines the taxonomy used for defining the testing tool catalog and discusses the results of a study involving three testing experts who validated the prototype.

The authors note the challenges in automated tool selection for software testing, given the multitude of testing activities and the various factors that need to be considered for each tool, such as supported activities, usability, and compatibility with other tools. They emphasize the potential benefits of their approach, including improved software quality, time savings for testing teams, and the identification of tool support for previously unconsidered activities.

Furthermore, the paper discusses related work in the domain of software engineering-specific ontologies and provides an overview of existing ontologies and reference architectures in the software testing domain. The authors also compare their approach with alternative methodologies for tool selection in other domains, highlighting the manual effort required by existing proposals.

In conclusion, the paper outlines future enhancements for the recommender system, such as the expansion of the tool catalog to accommodate additional ALM domains, the exploration of alternative multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques, and the ongoing development of the tool catalog.
