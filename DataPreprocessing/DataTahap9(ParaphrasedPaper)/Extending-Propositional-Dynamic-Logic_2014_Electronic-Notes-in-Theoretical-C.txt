This study introduces an extension of petri-pdl called the ds3 logic, which extends its applicability to stochastic petri nets. The ds3 logic offers a new method for modeling performance evaluation in a compositional and structural manner. The paper discusses the soundness, decidability, and completeness of the ds3 logic in relation to its semantics, and provides a proof of exptime-completeness for its satisfaction problem. Additionally, an example of its usage is presented.

The paper begins by outlining the theoretical and conceptual background that serves as the basis for the proposed extension in section 2, and provides a brief comparison with other approaches. Section 3 presents the technical background of petri nets, while section 4 introduces the ds3 logic and explores its properties. Furthermore, section 5 describes the two-person corridor tiling game reduction, and section 6 presents a usage example. Finally, the paper concludes with section 7, discussing the implications of the findings and outlining potential future work.
