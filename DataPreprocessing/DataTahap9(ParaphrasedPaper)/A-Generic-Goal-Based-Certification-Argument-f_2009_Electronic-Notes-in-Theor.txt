The use of formal methods as specification and verification techniques is a powerful way to establish high confidence in safety-critical systems. However, concerns exist about using evidence from formal methods in place of conventional testing to meet certain certification objectives. This paper addresses this issue by examining the acceptance of formal analytical evidence in certification documents such as DO-178B and the UK Defence Standard 00-56. We also propose a generic safety case framework that can be tailored to support the justification and presentation of formal analysis to certification authorities. The paper is organized as follows: Sections 2 and 3 review the consideration of formal analytical evidence in DO-178B and Defence Standard 00-56, while Section 4 introduces the safety case concept. In Section 5, we explore the role of Goal Structuring Notation (GSN) in communicating safety case arguments, and in Section 6, we present a generic GSN argument for justifying formal analysis. The paper concludes with a summary in Section 7.

Using free text in safety arguments can lead to challenges in ensuring that all stakeholders share a common understanding. To address this issue, a structured technique has been developed to better express and present safety arguments. The adoption of GSN has improved the comprehension of safety arguments among key project stakeholders, leading to higher quality discussions and reduced time in reaching agreement on argument approaches.

Successful industrial case studies are crucial for demonstrating the effectiveness of formal analysis by providing empirical data. These case studies should show how formal techniques integrate with other design and assessment techniques in real safety-critical systems, as well as communicate any limitations specific to the context of a project. It is important to demonstrate correspondence between the mathematical model and software behavior at run-time to instill confidence in formal analysis.

Formulating a compelling certification argument to provide strong, relevant, and sufficient evidence of formal analytical techniques satisfying certification objectives is essential. Despite concerns about the practicality of applying formal analytical approaches, successful industrial implementations illustrate that formal specification and analysis are not purely theoretical exercises. The safety case presented in this paper is based on claims about achieving certification objectives, demonstrating the trustworthiness of formal analysis, and the practical feasibility of deploying formal methods within a specific project.
