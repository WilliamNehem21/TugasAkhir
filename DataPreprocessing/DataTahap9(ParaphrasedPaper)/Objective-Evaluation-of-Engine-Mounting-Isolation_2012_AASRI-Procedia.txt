The graphs of vibration acceleration from the suspension point of the system under constant engine conditions reveal that as the engine speed increases, the acceleration of each suspension point significantly rises, especially in the higher engine speed range around 2000 revolutions per minute (rpm), where the trend becomes particularly noticeable. However, changes in engine speed do not cause obvious fluctuations in the vibration acceleration of each suspension point, and the increasing trend remains relatively consistent within the measurement range. The root mean square (rms) value of vibration is consistently maintained without significant fluctuations. Furthermore, the vibration response of the left front hydraulic suspension exceeds that of the right front hydraulic suspension, which can be attributed to the left-of-center placement of the powertrain's mass. The vibration level of the hydraulic mount exceeds that of the rubber mount due to the offset of the powertrain system's center of mass, with the former hydraulic mount supporting 80% of the powertrain mass.

These findings demonstrate that the vibration response of the powertrain's hydraulic suspension system and rubber suspension system under different conditions—steady state and startup—highlight the varying vibration performances of the hydraulic mount and rubber mount. Furthermore, the spectrum analysis of vibration response under startup conditions provides an in-depth exploration of the vibration isolation performance of the transit powertrain mounting system. Experimental results reveal that compared to the rubber mounting system, the hydraulic mount system offers distinct advantages in terms of isolation efficiency. In ensuring vehicle comfort, it is evident that the isolation performance is superior.
