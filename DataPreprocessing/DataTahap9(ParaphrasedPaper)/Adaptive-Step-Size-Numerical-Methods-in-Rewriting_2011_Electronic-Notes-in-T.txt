In this paper, the authors outline the utilization of adaptive-step-size numerical methods, which involve dynamically choosing the duration of small time steps. Adaptive-step-size approximations offer advantages such as enhancing precision by reducing the time step when approaching a discrete transition or when maintaining desired accuracy of the approximation, as well as increasing efficiency by enlarging the step size whenever feasible. Additionally, users have the flexibility to define their own error tolerance to balance between precision and computational efficiency.

The study introduces an adaptation of the Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg 4/5 method for approximating continuous system behavior with dynamic step-size based on user-provided error tolerance. The adapted method is implemented in real-time Maude, and the results and execution times of both simulation and model checking using different error tolerances on two thermal systems with realistic parameters are compared.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of real-time Maude, Section 3 briefly explains the approach for modeling hybrid systems in rewriting logic, while Section 4 presents the adaptation of the Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg 4/5 method and Section 5 describes its implementation in real-time Maude. The case studies are summarized in Section 6, and concluding remarks are given in Section 7.

The approach discussed in the paper entails two sources of errors: round-off errors due to limitations in representing numbers on computers, and discrete-time approximation errors arising from deviations of the approximations from the exact values. The use of higher-order numerical methods for estimating local errors is discussed, with a focus on methods that share function values, termed embedded pairs.

The Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg order 4/5 method (RKF45) is highlighted for its use of embedded pairs, employing a 5th order method to estimate the local error of a 4th order method. The paper discusses the challenges and benefits associated with this method in the context of phase transitions in thermal systems.

The attributes and parameters relevant to the adaptive-step-size technique are detailed, including those for defining the numerical method, error tolerance, step-size, and computation technique.

The results show that variations in the temperature values of the coffee are correlated with the error tolerances, and the execution of discrete events is dependent on the hybrid behavior execution strategy. The limitations of the execution strategy using adaptive step-size techniques are also highlighted.

In summary, the paper describes the adaptation of the adaptive-step-size technique based on the Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg 4/5 method for modeling interacting physical systems and its implementation in real-time Maude. It presents a comparative analysis of precision and execution times for thermal systems, demonstrating the trade-off between error tolerance, accuracy of the continuous behavior approximation, and computational effort. Additionally, weaknesses in the execution strategy for hybrid behavior with adaptive step size techniques are identified.
