We present a comprehensive graph-based approach to multi-modal logics, offering sound and complete calculi. This formalism integrates the (Kripke) semantics of modal logics and provides consistent tools for expressing and manipulating modal formulas. Our graph calculus for logic K is demonstrated, and we showcase its extension to accommodate modalities such as the global and difference modalities in a natural manner. Additionally, we illustrate the potential for easy extension to other normal modal logics, such as T, S4, and S5.

The paper's structure is as follows: Section 2 introduces and elucidates the main concepts underpinning our graph-based approach to modal logics. In Section 3, we outline our graph language for modal logics, encompassing syntax, semantics, and various constructions. Section 4 introduces our graph calculus for modal logics, along with its conversion and expansion rules, while also discussing its correctness. Section 5 outlines extensions of our graph calculus to address specific modalities (such as the global and difference modalities) and modalities with properties like reflexivity, symmetry, transitivity, and determinism. Finally, Section 6 presents concluding remarks.

Our graph approach to multi-modal logics yields valid calculi. By internalizing the (Kripke) semantics of modal logics, such formalisms offer consistent tools for expressing and manipulating modal formulas. The soundness and completeness of our rules signify that they capture the intended meanings of the concepts. Additionally, the uniformity of the approach provides the flexibility necessary for natural presentation of extensions by expressing corresponding intuitive ideas.

The examples in Section 2 suggest the existence of finite counter-models. While the construction outlined in 4.3 does not guarantee a finite model, we believe that we can extend the filtration method to our approach, thereby obtaining finite models. Furthermore, it appears that familiar modal logic concepts, such as bi-simulation, have appropriate analogues for graphs.
