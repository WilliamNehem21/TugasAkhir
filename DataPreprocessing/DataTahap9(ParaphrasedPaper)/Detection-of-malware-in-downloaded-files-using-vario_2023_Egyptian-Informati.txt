The exponential increase in the risk of malware infecting computers that store essential data is primarily attributed to the downloading of files from the internet. The rapid compromise of systems by hackers underscores the urgency of the situation. The escalating threat of financial fraud perpetrated through technology necessitates the use of automated or semi-automated analysis to detect and address fraudulent activities. However, the unpredictable timeframe for developing effective defense systems is detrimental to users. Ransomware, a prevalent type of malware attack, involves holding data hostage and demanding a ransom, with no guarantee of data recovery even after payment. The widespread storage of critical data on electronic devices has significantly elevated the risk of malware infection, particularly through internet downloads. Malware attacks have been associated with various societal, economic, cultural, and political conflicts, enabling hackers to wreak havoc by stealing information and incapacitating computers, leading to numerous reported breaches across various industries.

The research by N. Udayakumar et al. aims to comprehend different types of malware and how machine learning can be employed to detect and classify them. The study utilizes various parameters to collect data about different malware types and employs three machine learning algorithms—decision trees, multilayer perceptron, and multi SVM—for their classification, with the neural networks model demonstrating the best performance. The research also expands the range of machine learning models used for classifying downloaded files and can detect a larger number of malware types compared to previous studies, including adware, trojan, backdoors, unknown, multidrop, rbot, spam, and ransomware. The study discusses both supervised and unsupervised machine learning models and their applications in malware detection, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, support vector machine, k-means clustering, and principal component analysis.

The study involves the exploration and synthesis of diverse datasets related to malicious and benign files from various sources to construct a comprehensive dataset. Furthermore, it delves into the need for dataset cleansing and exploration of relevant features to identify trends and patterns. The study observes that supervised machine learning models, particularly the random forest model, achieve superior accuracy compared to unsupervised models.

The issue of dataset imbalance is addressed through various techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, and the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE), resulting in improved accuracy for the trained models. Additionally, the study addresses dataset formatting inconsistencies and null values through data preprocessing techniques, ultimately enhancing the accuracy of the trained models.

The study highlights the importance of leveraging machine learning models in cybersecurity to combat advanced malicious software, particularly polymeric malware, which is challenging to detect using traditional signature-based methods. Looking ahead, the project envisions the continuous exploration of different machine learning models to identify the most effective model for specific needs and to enhance prediction accuracy. Additionally, the study emphasizes the importance of addressing multicollinearity and the development of behavior-based patterns to detect complex malware.
