This research introduces bio-pepa, a process algebra designed for modeling and analyzing biochemical networks. Bio-pepa is adapted from pepa to handle specific features of biological models, such as stoichiometry and the use of generic kinetic laws. It functions as a formal, compositional representation of biological systems, enabling various types of analysis. Additionally, the paper demonstrates a model of a simple genetic network using the new language.

In recent years, there has been growing interest in using process algebras to model and analyze biological systems. Process algebras are well-suited for formally describing and analyzing biological systems as a whole, including the interactions among genes and proteins. Biological systems can be abstracted as concurrent systems described by process algebras, where species are represented as processes interacting with each other and reactions are modeled using actions.

Pepa, originally developed for the performance analysis of computer systems, has been applied to signaling pathways. However, it lacks the ability to represent all features of biochemical models, such as stoichiometry and kinetic laws. This paper introduces bio-pepa, a modified version of pepa designed specifically for modeling and analyzing biochemical networks, explicitly representing the stoichiometry and roles of different species in reactions. Bio-pepa introduces functional rates to express general kinetic laws and offers a high level of abstraction for modeling biochemical networks.

The paper elaborates on the application of bio-pepa to represent biochemical networks, including gene regulatory networks, signaling pathways, and metabolic pathways. It highlights the introduction of functional rates to express general kinetic laws and discusses the challenges arising from different time-scales for reaction rates and kinetic laws under various conditions.

The research also emphasizes the representation of biochemical networks and describes how reactions and species are modeled using bio-pepa. Additionally, it highlights the future directions of the research, including the relation between Gillespie simulation and general kinetic laws, as well as the application of model checking techniques for analyzing properties of a bio-pepa system.
