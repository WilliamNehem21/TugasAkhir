The TMS320VC5509 receives instructions from the human machine interface (HMI), enabling it to not only furnish timing signals to the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and first-in, first-out (FIFO) buffer, but also establish the counting mode of the system. Simultaneously, the timing generator supplies timing signals for the charge-coupled device (CCD) sensor. The digital signal processor (DSP) continuously retrieves image data from the FIFO by monitoring the half-full flag of the FIFO until all the data from the detection channel is transmitted to the synchronous dynamic random access memory (SDRAM). Following a series of data processing operations, the DSP transmits the processing results to the HMI. The results are displayed on the touch screen of the human machine interface and automatically saved to the SD card.
