Gin, a measure defined as the ratio of IC50 to Cmax in plasma, is utilized for risk assessment in later stages of drug discovery. The Pre-Clinical Safety (PCS) department at Novartis monitors the safety margin of BSEP (bile salt export pump), where a low safety margin indicates a higher risk of serious drug-induced liver injury (DILI), and vice versa. However, compounds falling into the intermediate activity range were excluded due to practical limitations, which simplified the modeling task. In a recent study, Mcloughlin et al. conducted an extensive benchmark of predictive models for BSEP inhibition using 1149 compounds, evaluating over 15,500 models with different algorithms, hyperparameters, descriptors, and data splitting approaches. The study did not observe the superiority of deep learning methods, and the preferred approach was random forest (RF) with Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) descriptors, similar to a previous study by Montanari et al.

The in-house BSEP assay measures [3H]taurocholate uptake by inverted vesicles prepared from HEK293 cells over-expressing human recombinant BSEP (HRBSEP). BSEP inhibition is quantified with the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50). In vitro BSEP data was assembled and pre-processed, with measurements lacking associated structure or report date being discarded, and salts being removed from the dataset. Compounds were represented using RDKit 2D descriptors and/or Morgan fingerprints (MFP), with descriptor vectors having a length of 200 and MFP having a length of 2048 with radius 2.

Machine learning (ML) methods were applied for classification and regression models, including partial least squares (PLS) and lasso regression for linear regression, and non-linear support vector regression (SVR) with a radial basis function. The study also compared binary classification performance for models based on 2D descriptors and/or MFP, and tree-ensembles (extratrees, RF, XGBoost) or k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), optimizing hyperparameters such as learning rate, maximum depth, and subsample.

The study also performed a calculation of the number of scaffolds and compounds per scaffold, showing a high percentage of singletons in the dataset and a few large clusters. Additionally, permutation tests were carried out to assess the significance of obtained results, with the findings indicating that the in-house XGBoost model outperformed alternative models.

Spearman rank correlation values indicated that ML models provide a better ranking and more effective guidance for compound modifications related to BSEP inhibition compared to current literature strategies that focus on molecular weight and lipophilicity modifications. The study emphasized the importance of robust model building and evaluation to support correct decisions in the pharmaceutical industry, particularly in drug discovery.

Overall, the study highlighted the potential of ML-based predictions to provide decision support during early stages of drug discovery and in vitro experiment prioritization. ML-based predictions can be used as an additional factor to de-risk compounds or series at early stages, and even assist in the decision-making process when considering safety or liver toxicity.
