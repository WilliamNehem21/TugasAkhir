Psychiatry presents significant challenges within the field of medical sciences, as psychiatric diseases are complex and their symptoms are often subjective and difficult to measure directly. This can lead to biased decision-making when correlating investigation results and treatment with the course of morbidity. The onset of depression is often difficult to recognize and may be attributed to non-psychiatric illnesses, such as cancer or chronic pain. Additionally, different diseases can present with similar symptoms, leading to a lengthy process from screening for depression to formal diagnosis. 

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses the use of fuzzy set, fuzzy logic, and neural network approaches in mental health research. Section 3 details the methodology of the study, while Section 4 presents and discusses the experimental results. Finally, Section 5 examines the key outcomes and provides a conclusion.

In a separate study, a hierarchical decision-tree-based fuzzy model was proposed to screen and grade cases of premenstrual syndrome (PMS), which straddles the domains of gynecology and psychiatry. The study concluded that a suitable rule base could be created to diagnose complex cross-domain diseases that lack standardized diagnostic rule sets.

Another study used artificial neural networks (ANN) to explore the correlation between recurrent suicide attempts and the overall history of self-harm among Taiwanese soldiers. The study identified ten factors influencing suicidal risks and achieved a sensitivity of 82% and specificity of 86% using radial basis function (RBF) network training.

A decision support system (DSS) was developed for rural doctors to diagnose psychiatric illnesses using a combination of RBF and back propagation neural network (BPNN) algorithms. The system achieved a diagnostic accuracy of 98.75%.

Another study examined the use of a neuro-fuzzy model to predict weight changes in chronic schizophrenic patients exposed to atypical or typical antipsychotics over a period of several years, achieving a prediction accuracy of 93%.

Finally, a study utilized neuro-fuzzy classification architecture and back propagation algorithm (ANNB) to differentiate between epileptic and non-epileptic events. This approach achieved a sensitivity of 85% using nefclass, while ANNB achieved a sensitivity of 95.65%.
