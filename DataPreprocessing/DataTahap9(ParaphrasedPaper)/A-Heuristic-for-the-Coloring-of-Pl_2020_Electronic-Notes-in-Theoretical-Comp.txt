We introduce an approach for coloring planar graphs, which involves constructing a maximal independent set, denoted as S, from the input graph. This set, S, must satisfy specific criteria, such as including the vertex that appears in the greatest number of odd cycles of the graph G. The construction of S takes into account the internal-face graph of the input graph G to choose each vertex that belongs to the maximal number of odd faces of G.

Moving forward, our discussion is limited to planar graphs as the focus of our study. According to the well-known four coloring theorem [1,2,16], any planar graph can be colored using four colors. However, the current proof for the four coloring theorem is computer-assisted and remains complex and lengthy.

Each face, denoted as Ri, is characterized by the set of edges that enclose its interior region. Any edge {u, v} in G that does not form the boundary of a face in G is represented by its vertex label uv, and these edges are referred to as acyclic edges.

Lemma 3.2 states that if a set A = {f1, f2,..., fn} comprises n faces, each containing at least one vertex that does not impose a color restriction of 3, and the set of faces is independent or all have a common vertex, then A can be 3-colored.

The aforementioned lemma is utilized in the context that for any vertex of minimal degree (e.g., less than 3), three colors are sufficient for coloring. This can be applied at the start of any 4-coloring algorithm to simplify the resulting graph. Moreover, this lemma enables us to consider only one edge between adjacent faces because having more than two edges between adjacent faces would entail vertices of degree 2 that can be contracted to any of the extremal points of the common boundary between both faces.

The internal-face graph of G, denoted as GF, is constructed, considering that it is not the dual graph of G, since the external face is not taken into account in its construction. Additionally, GF is a planar graph, with its nodes representing faces of G, and it is not necessarily a tree graph. However, if GF has a tree topology, it yields a significant property for the coloring of G.

When GF is a tree, G (its corresponding planar graph) is referred to as a polygonal tree. This implies that despite G having cycles, all those cycles can be organized in the form of a tree, with its nodes being polygons instead of single vertices of G. In such cases, an ordering of the faces of the planar graph facilitates efficient procedures for 3-coloring G. It has been demonstrated that polygonal trees are 3-colorable graphs.

We have presented an algorithm with a time complexity of O(n^2) (where n is the number of vertices) for coloring planar graphs. Our approach is based on computing a maximal independent set, denoted as S, from the input graph G. This set, S, exhibits specific characteristics, with one of them being that it includes the vertex that appears in the maximum number of odd faces of G. Furthermore, the construction of S takes into consideration the internal-face graph of the input graph G to select each vertex belonging to the maximal number of odd faces of G.
