Predicting failures has always been a difficult challenge, especially with the increasing complexity of high-performance cloud data center infrastructure. Traditional fault-tolerance techniques, such as data replication and periodic check-pointing, are not effective for handling the current computing systems. This has created a need for a robust system that can accurately predict potential future system failures. In this paper, the authors studied five years' worth of production-failure data from the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC) to develop a failure prediction model focused on high-performance cloud data center infrastructure. The model, which utilized the auto-regressive moving average (ARMA) method, achieved a 95% accuracy in predicting system failures. The authors believe that their approach is practical and can be implemented in real-time systems.

Cloud service providers are also facing the challenge of providing scalable, efficient, and reliable resources to customers while fulfilling service level agreements (SLAs) in the presence of faults. Large cloud data centers are designed to guarantee a certain level of availability to business systems, and infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) clouds offer computational and storage resources to ensure high availability despite common component failures. To maintain service availability, cloud infrastructures should be designed to minimize system downtime, often achieved through data replication and checkpointing techniques.

Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is a fundamental cloud service model providing resources such as virtual machines, load balancers, fault tolerance, and networking services to users. Platform as a service (PaaS) is another model that offers computing platforms, APIs, operating systems, and development environments to users while the cloud provider maintains service run-times and databases. The paper also outlines the major players in the IaaS and PaaS markets such as Microsoft Windows Azure, Google Apps Engine, and Amazon Web Services, highlighting the benefits of these services including a focus on high-value software and scalable capabilities.

The paper is organized as follows: it includes a summary of related work, a description of the methodology and dataset, the results, analysis of system failure distribution, and a conclusion. The authors emphasize the need for empirical analysis and prediction of high-performance and cloud failure data characteristics, citing the lack of comprehensive studies in the area.

The paper also discusses the use of time series models for prediction and the collection of failure data from the NERSC, emphasizing the broad application of these techniques in various domains. The authors express their gratitude to the anonymous reviewers and funding support from the Petroleum Technology Development Fund (PTDF).

In conclusion, the paper presents an effective failure prediction model for high-performance cloud data center infrastructure and highlights the challenges and strategies for ensuring availability in cloud environments.
