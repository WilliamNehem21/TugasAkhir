However, the analysis conducted within these frameworks remains binary: a timed automaton either satisfies a property or it does not, and two hybrid automata are either bisimilar or they are not. While this boolean approach to quantitative system analysis is susceptible to fragility, as slight changes in the values within the system description may result in contradictory truth values for property satisfaction. This poses a problem since the system values are typically known only approximately, often obtained through measurement, learning, or educated approximations.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a brief overview of the theory on automata over infinite words, Section 3 introduces QTS and QMC models, Section 4 presents the logic QLTL, and Section 5 outlines our model checking algorithms. Additionally, in Section 6, we introduce several extensions to the theory, and Section 7 presents our conclusions.

Theorem 2.1 was initially formulated in [reference], presenting a doubly exponential construction. This construction was further refined in [reference], providing a singly exponential construction with an almost linear exponent. Specifically, if A has n states, then A' has 2^O(n log n) states and O(n) pairs in its acceptance condition.
