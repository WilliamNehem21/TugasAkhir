Feferman and Vaught in 1959 presented the compositional method, which enables the reduction of the model-checking problem for a product structure to the model-checking problem for its components. Originally applicable to first-order logic, recent work by Rabinovich (2007) uncovered limitations in its usage. This study refines the findings of Rabinovich by demonstrating the applicability of the composition method to the asynchronous product and the finitely synchronized product for an extended modal logic. This extended modal logic incorporates a condition on path lengths that enhances the reachability modality with, and we show that a minor extension to this logic results in the breakdown of the composition theorem. Additionally, we provide commentary on potential expansions of the results and propose open questions for future research.

In the field of model theory, Feferman and Vaught proposed a compositional method that allows for the reduction of the first-order theory of a generalized product of structures to the first-order theory of the component structures and the monadic theory of the index structure upon which the product is constructed. Numerous variants of this method have emerged since the original work of Feferman and Vaught, and an extensive overview can be found in prior literature. Furthermore, we investigate different products of transition systems, specifically the asynchronous and synchronized products. The definition of the synchronized product largely follows existing literature, with the exception that the same labels for local transitions are utilized across all components. Notably, we employ the abbreviation [n] to denote the set {1,..., n}.
