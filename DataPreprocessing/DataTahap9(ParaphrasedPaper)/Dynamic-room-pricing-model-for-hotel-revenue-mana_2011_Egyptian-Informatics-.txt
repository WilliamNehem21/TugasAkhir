This paper explores the issue of determining optimal room pricing in hotels with the goal of maximizing revenue. It introduces a hotel revenue management model that leverages dynamic pricing to offer hotel managers a flexible and effective tool for making decisions regarding room revenue optimization. The model is founded on a novel optimization framework and a multi-class scheme akin to that used in the airline industry. The paper posits that this framework addresses the limitations present in the existing pricing literature and has the potential to significantly augment hotel revenue. This hypothesis is put to the test through the examination of three different approaches, which demonstrate increased revenue compared to the traditional models found in literature.

In contrast to utilizing a dynamic programming formulation, the paper adopts a non-linear programming formulation capable of tackling realistically sized problems. The plan is to execute the model on the hotel server every night, during its idle time, resulting in minimal additional cost. The model outputs the optimal prices for each night to guide the hotel's pricing policy. Notably, these prices may be continuous, akin to the output of most online booking systems, thereby obviating the need for further approximation. However, to prevent customer dissatisfaction from daily price changes, the system only presents the average room price.

To integrate this dynamic pricing model into revenue management systems, the paper conducts interviews with domain experts to discern the most critical features of hotel management. The experts express a desire for a multi-category mechanism akin to that used in the airline industry. Subsequently, a parametric analysis is carried out to determine different rates for each category, with the aim of enabling dynamic price adjustments. This approach yields different prices for each day according to the forecasted demand, with the price fluctuating in response to changes in demand.

The paper presents the results of the proposed model, which is tested using three different approaches. A case study is utilized to illustrate the model's effectiveness in determining optimal prices for each night three months in advance of actual reservations. A hotel simulator is employed to generate forecasted demand based on past reservation data. In the case study, the time horizon is 90 nights, with a maximum guest stay of 14 days and a hotel room capacity of 80 rooms at a nominal price of $120.

Overall, the paper demonstrates the potential for the proposed dynamic pricing model to enhance hotel revenue compared to traditional models. It emphasizes the generality of the proposed model, making it applicable to hotels across different classes.
