The speed of processing is a critical factor in medical image denoising, leading to the focus on developing methods that can reduce computational time. Yan et al. utilized clustering-based preclassification to achieve faster processing without eliminating any pixels in weight calculation. They employed the k-means algorithm for clustering, manually setting the value of k based on visual perception and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) values. The k-means algorithm divided patches into distinct clusters, ensuring that each element of a patch belonged to exactly one cluster, thus preventing candidates from being present in more than one cluster, as would occur in fuzzy clustering.

In this paper, a novel non-local means (NLM) framework for speckle noise removal in breast ultrasound images is presented. The proposed method enhances NLM performance through an automated clustering-based preclassification scheme using gap statistics and a new similarity measure based on rotationally invariant moment distance. The results demonstrate that the presented method yields improved quantitative outcomes compared to other state-of-the-art NLM-based methods, making it suitable for ultrasound computer-aided breast cancer diagnosis systems due to its resilience against noise and efficient processing time.
