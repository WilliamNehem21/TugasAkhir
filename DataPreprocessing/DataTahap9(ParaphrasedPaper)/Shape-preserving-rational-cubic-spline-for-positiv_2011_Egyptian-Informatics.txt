This academic paper introduces the concept of a C2 rational cubic spline that preserves shape. The paper discusses solutions for maintaining the shapes of positive and convex data using the proposed spline. It introduces a C2 rational cubic function with two sets of free parameters to achieve positive and convex curves with C2 continuity from the respective data. The paper also outlines simple data-dependent constraints on the free parameters of the rational cubic function to ensure the desired shape of the data. The rational cubic schemes presented in the paper have unique representations.

Hussain et al. addressed the problem of visualizing scientific data by using a rational cubic function to achieve shaped data. They derived conditions on the free parameters of the rational cubic function to obtain the desired shapes of the data, with the resulting smoothness achieved at C1. Sarfraz et al. developed a C1 interpolant to visualize the shape of 2D positive data, also deriving conditions on the free parameters in the description of the rational cubic function for this purpose. Additionally, they extended their scheme to visualize the shape of 3D positive data.
