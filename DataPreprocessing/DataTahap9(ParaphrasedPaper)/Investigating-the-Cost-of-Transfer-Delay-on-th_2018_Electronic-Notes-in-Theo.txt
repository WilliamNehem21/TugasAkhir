This study evaluates the performance of partitioned workflows across hybrid clouds, taking into account data transfer delays. It builds on previous research on the cost of security in cloud computing using a multi-level security model, aiming to predict performance of different deployment options in public and private clouds in terms of computation and communication costs. The study utilizes the Pepa Markovian process algebra to evaluate model behavior under various scenarios.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides background and related work, Section 3 briefly describes the multi-level security model, Section 4 presents the Pepa communication cost model, Section 5 discusses experimental results, and Section 6 concludes and outlines potential future work.

Federated clouds offer cost reductions in computational support, but data flow between private and public clouds can lead to security breaches. The paper proposes a methodology for dynamic access control matrices, using Petri nets to model workflows while considering security policies for read and write access. It also utilizes the Bell-Lapadula security conditions to assign different security levels in a formal model specified by Petri nets. While similar to other approaches in using a multi-level security model and formal modeling of workflows, this study focuses more on investigating the performance cost of security in cloud computing rather than control access.

The study explores varying parameters for data transfer delay and demonstrates that option 4 may be a valuable choice in terms of data transfer cost, similar to option 1 in the public cloud. However, the cost of designing and creating data centers and computational expenses may be higher for option 4. Therefore, option 1 remains cost-effective, particularly when the number of workflow instances and servers is relatively small.

The paper also examines the impact of communication costs on the performance of option 1, comparing low and high data transfer delay rates with two sets of experiments using ODE analysis.

Overall, the study presents a methodology for investigating the cost of data transfer delay in cloud computing using the Pepa process algebra while extending previous work to examine communication costs of security deployment options. It offers insight into system behavior, but acknowledges limitations such as lack of validation against real implementation and consideration of data transfer delay cost subject to network contention. These considerations could have significant impacts on the attractiveness of alternative workflows, especially when there is mixed usage of public and private clouds.
