This academic paper suggests formal methods for analyzing adaptive systems at low levels of abstraction and proposes flexible policy-based approaches for designing adaptive systems without a formal foundation. The authors propose a flexible policy-based approach with a formal foundation to support the modeling and verification of self-adaptive systems. This approach utilizes policies to separate behavioral rules from system functionality, allowing for higher abstraction and enabling changes to system behavior without altering the system's code or functionality. The authors also emphasize the importance of adapting strategies to ensure a safe and timely adaptation phase. While the approach can support both structural and behavioral adaptation, the paper focuses specifically on behavioral adaptation. The formal foundation, modular model, and separation of adaptation rules are expected to facilitate the development of rigorous analysis techniques.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents an example to illustrate the authors' approach, while Section 3 introduces the Pobsam model briefly. Sections 4 and 5 cover the syntax and semantics of Pobsam, respectively. Section 6 provides a comparison of the authors' approach with existing methods in related work. Finally, in Section 7, the authors present their conclusions and outline plans for future work.

In the specific example of a home automation system, sensors collect environmental data, and actuators are used to modify the user environment based on predefined policies. The system is designed to manage lighting, doors/windows, and heating according to these policies. The authors introduce the concept of Self-Managed Module (SMM) as the building block of Pobsam, consisting of a set of actors that can autonomously manage their behavior according to predefined policies. Pobsam supports interactions between SMMs, enabling well-defined interfaces for such interactions. In a case study of a smart home, the authors consider three SMMs: lightclmodule, tempclmodule, and dwclmodule, responsible for managing lighting, temperature, and doors/windows, respectively.

The authors illustrate an example of the lightclmodule, which includes a set of light rebecs controlled by lightmngr. They describe a reactive class named "light" that models the lights and includes message servers for setting intensity, switching on and off, as well as variables for intensity and status.

Pobsam employs the use of policies to direct actors and has a mechanism to reduce, intersect, and union policy sets. The authors emphasize that Pobsam decouples the adaptation layer from the functional layer, enabling independent verification provided that there is a labeled transition system modeling view behavior. This feature aims to simplify the verification process.

The paper notes that while structural adaptation has received substantial attention, fewer approaches address behavioral adaptation. The authors present related work on the formal modeling of self-adaptive systems and the application of policy-based approaches in engineering such systems.

The authors propose Pobsam as a formal model to develop self-adaptive systems, in which a system is composed of a set of autonomous components (SMMs) containing managed actors for the functional layer and autonomous managers for coordinating actors using policies to achieve predefined goals. The model integrates algebra and an actor-based model as formal methods to specify a system, and the operational semantics of Pobsam are presented using labeled transition systems.

The paper indicates that further research is needed in the area of verification of self-adaptive systems, and the authors plan to implement a tool to support their approach. Additional research will focus on specifying structural adaptations, as well as extending the model for self-organizing systems in which managers need to coordinate with each other.
