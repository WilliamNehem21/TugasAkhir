The differential evolution (DE) algorithm, developed by Storn and Price, has become a widely recognized heuristic method for solving global optimization problems, attracting attention from researchers across various scientific disciplines. Its increasing popularity can be attributed to its simplicity, ease of use, and strong convergence capabilities in addressing optimization problems. This population-based heuristic algorithm has been applied in numerous practical scenarios with favorable results.

However, one drawback of the DE algorithm is that it may lead to the convergence of solutions, diminishing the diversity within the population. This can be problematic as it reduces the exploration of the solution space. To address this issue, this paper introduces new methods based on chaotic functions, as an alternative to the traditional random procedure. Chaotic functions have found applications in various domains, including meteorology, computer science, chemical engineering, economics, and biology. These functions exhibit the behavior of dynamic systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions, resulting in points in a chaotic system being arbitrarily close to other points with different future trajectories. Hence, a small change in the existing trajectory can lead to significantly different behavior.

The DE algorithm is a simple yet powerful evolutionary algorithm for global optimization, contrasting with the simple genetic algorithm that employs binary coding to represent individuals. Instead, the DE algorithm uses floating-point coding to represent individuals. The fundamental concept of the DE algorithm involves generating trial parameter vectors by adding the difference between two individuals to a third individual in the population, using mutation and crossover operators to create new individuals, and then employing a selection operator to determine which vectors will continue into the next generation.

The structure of the DE algorithm shares similarities with other population-based optimization algorithms and is characterized by three important parameters: scaling factor (SF), crossover constant (CR), and population size (PS). The population comprises PS individuals, with each individual representing a value within the feasible region of the optimization problem. PS is determined initially based on optimization parameters and remains constant throughout the optimization process.

As an example, the paper describes the application of the DE algorithm in a specific context of a fluidized bed, which includes a centrifugal fan to supply air flow from ambient air. Key output parameters in the drying process, such as moisture content and product temperature, are also discussed.

In summary, the DE algorithm stands as a promising approach for addressing global optimization problems, and the introduction of methods based on chaotic functions presents a potential enhancement to its exploration capabilities.
