The paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we provide a brief overview of two UML 2.0 diagrams used for component-based modeling. Section 3 introduces our underlying semantic model, concurrent automata. In section 4, we present our concurrent logic. The paper concludes with some closing remarks and suggestions for future research endeavors.

The relationship between our model and behavioral representations follows the process described in an earlier document. We can establish an ordering on behaviors and associate occurrences with primes using standard techniques found in existing literature. In this scenario, we have observed that vectors are interconnected through a coordinatewise prefix ordering, and a prime represents a vector that exactly encompasses another vector. Each vector is then linked with the set of primes underneath it, which facilitates a formal treatment of phenomena such as concurrency and nondeterminism.

Another advantage of our approach lies in the true-concurrent hierarchical logic, which enables us to explicitly express concurrency and reflect component properties at various levels of abstraction. As noted previously, we need to clarify the process of translating formulas from one perspective to another. To the best of our knowledge, existing logics addressing concurrency do not possess the capability to explore different levels of abstraction in a similar manner. This is a critical feature for addressing complex component-based systems. 

Currently, we are working on integrating our concurrent logic and concurrent automata into the Edinburgh Concurrency Workbench (CWB). Since concurrent automata are an extension of ATS, we anticipate that the CWB extension process will be relatively straightforward, building on previous work on defining an ATS semantics for CCS. Ultimately, our goal is to establish a connection between UML 2.0 and CWB, thereby enabling the verification of component-based systems.
