In spontaneous networked organizations, or any dynamic open organizations, independent agents must engage in interactions with each other in order to achieve their objectives. Due to the large scale and dynamic nature of these organizations, agents often interact with unfamiliar counterparts. As a result, each agent must possess certain qualities of interest in order to quickly integrate into such environments. In this study, we outline the essential qualities of interest for a spontaneous networked organization, such as social harmony, coherence, and spontaneity, and their impact on the interaction process among agents within a collaborative organization. These qualities aim to enhance the social capital of networked organizations.

The concept of spontaneous networked organizations (SNO) involves the dynamic amalgamation of computational resources across organizational boundaries to address specific problems suggested by agents. This paper seeks to provide a deeper understanding of the nature of SNO by exploring the defining qualities that characterize these organizations.

We propose a set of lightweight qualities of interest for agents within SNO, which capture different interaction types and their influence on the social capital within the organization. The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 outlines the methods used to generate prototypical SNO, Section 3 evaluates the spontaneously generated connections, Section 4 describes the parameterizations of these qualities of interest, and Section 5 presents related work. The article concludes in Section 6.

Within the SNO framework, agents operate within an uncertain environment, akin to a Bayesian game, where each communication prompts agents to update their information to align more closely with others and the actual state of the game. Decision-making within SNO is based on locally consistent information partitions due to the incomplete information about the environment.

In social networks, agents' actions lead to different types of connections, which have a broader impact virtually than in real-life scenarios. This is due to the absence of structured hierarchies or other organizational frameworks in SNO. Therefore, SNO is best suited to describe organizations with such spontaneous actions, and additional attributes contribute to this organizational style by measuring the quality of interactions and their effect on social capital.

Existing organizational structures lack the representational power to capture the essence of SNO. Thus, we propose three important qualities of interest to measure the structure of SNO: social harmony, cohesion, and spontaneity.

Social harmony is a crucial attribute for SNO, as it reflects the congenial relationships within a social network. The study also examines the impact of leadership on social harmony, emphasizing the importance of intrinsic communications based on shared affinities or interest among separate agents, which contribute to the measurement of social capital.

The study delves into social capital in the network, defining it as the cooperative nature of agents from myriad networked organizations operating in unison from their organizational origins. The microscopic perspective is explored to understand how individuals can access resources based on their positions and connections within the network.

In open environments like SNO, agents integrate dynamically across organizational boundaries to meet each other's needs, necessitating an adaptable SNO model to improve social harmony, coherence, and spontaneity. This paper argues that the properties of interaction described are more prominent in SNO than in traditional organizations. Agents within SNO must assess these measurements with their peers to maintain continuity towards the organization's goals.
