This academic paper focuses on the importance of extracting super-functions (SF) to facilitate SF-based machine translation, presenting a method for automatically extracting SF from a Japanese-English bilingual corpus. By leveraging a bilingual dictionary, the proposed extraction process identifies corresponding Japanese and English nouns in each bilingual sentence. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in automatically extracting SF for machine translation and reveal challenges in SF-based machine translation. Subsequently, the paper discusses the need for machine translation in processing foreign language documents, highlighting the inadequacies of current systems in meeting user demands for accuracy and quality. To address these issues, the paper introduces an automated method for extracting SF from a bilingual corpus by matching common nouns in source and target languages. Through a translation experiment using the extracted SF, the paper evaluates the validity and challenges of translation utilizing SF.

The paper outlines the research objectives, provides a definition and structure of SF in SF-based machine translation, details the method of automatically extracting SF from a bilingual corpus, presents experimental findings on the validity of the extraction method, and discusses the results in Section 6. Additionally, the paper reports on the comparison between automatically and manually extracted SF, finding a high correspondence rate but also identifying errors in morphological analysis and noun classification rules. The paper also highlights the use of the extracted SF in a translation experiment involving a large number of sentences, demonstrating the successful translation of the original sentences and the need to refine candidate SF with multiple translation options. Overall, the paper offers a method for automatically extracting SF from a corpus and demonstrates its effectiveness in facilitating machine translation, while also identifying areas for improvement and future research.
