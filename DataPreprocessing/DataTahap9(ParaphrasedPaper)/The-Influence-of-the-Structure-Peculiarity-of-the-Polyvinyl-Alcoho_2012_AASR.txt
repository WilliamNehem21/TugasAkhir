To prepare the samples in the initial phase, it is essential to disperse the zinc oxide within the polymer matrix. This involved moistening 12 grams of zinc oxide(II) with water and adding it to 100 ml of a 10% polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) water solution, which had been homogenized on a bain-marie beforehand. After a settling time of one hour, a resulting mixture of 60 grams was coated onto a glass plate with an area of 234 sq.cm. The composition was then dried horizontally at room temperature for 24 hours.

In order to meet these objectives, samples of the light-sensitive compositions were exposed to the integrated spectrum light from a drt-125 mercury-vapor lamp for various durations. The sample surface was illuminated with an intensity of e=0.105 w/sq.cm., and the determination of optical blackening was conducted using the author's hardware-software complex.

It is probable that the presence of acetate groups in the PVA structure triggers deacylation reactions (the removal of acetic acid residue) in the early stages of irradiation. It is well-known that deacylation reactions occur more readily in the presence of an electrophilic agent due to the high polarity of the bond. In the PVA-ZnO-BiCl3 composition, such an agent could be a hydrogen ion (H+), which is formed in the composition during photoinitiated processes.
