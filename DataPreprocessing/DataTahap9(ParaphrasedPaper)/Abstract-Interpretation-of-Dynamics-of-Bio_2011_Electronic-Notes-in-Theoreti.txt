The study of the dynamics of large biological regulatory networks (BRNs) requires innovative methods to manage the explosion of the state space. Techniques such as static analysis and abstract interpretation show promise in addressing this challenge. This paper focuses on the process hitting framework, which has been found useful for modeling the dynamics of BRNs with discrete values. We propose leveraging the specific structure of process hitting to develop efficient static analyses, and introduce a novel method for determining the reachability of a component's state within a BRN modeled in process hitting. This decision is made through abstract interpretation and static analysis of process hittings. We demonstrate the scalability of our approach through its application in the analysis of a BRN with 40 components.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 formally defines the process hitting framework. Section 3 details the abstract interpretation of process reachability, while Section 4 applies the presented method to analyze a large BRN. Our contributions are discussed in Section 5.

We conducted experiments on the reachability decisions for all possible input combinations (components cd45, cd8, tcrlig) to each output (components cre, ap1, nfkb, nfat), all resulting in conclusive decisions. The response times were around one second on a 3GHz processor with 2GB of RAM. To provide a comparison, we conducted similar experiments using a model-checking method with state-space compression, the libddd framework, known for its strong performance. For numerous reachability decisions, the program ran out of memory, and for others, response times ranged from a few seconds to several hours. This demonstrates the remarkable efficiency of our method, based on abstract interpretation.

Thanks to the specific structure of process hitting models, a robust static analysis and abstract interpretation method has been developed for determining the reachability of a process, and thus a component level, within the context of BRN modeling. The computation is achieved through over- and under-approximation of the decision, and may prove inconclusive. Further enhancements to our procedure are currently underway to reduce the number of inconclusive cases (Section 3.4).

This new and original approach has been applied to the analysis of a large BRN (40 components). Response times are exceptionally fast (around one second on a desktop computer), demonstrating the scalability of our method. We anticipate its application to even larger networks (100 components) in the near future.
