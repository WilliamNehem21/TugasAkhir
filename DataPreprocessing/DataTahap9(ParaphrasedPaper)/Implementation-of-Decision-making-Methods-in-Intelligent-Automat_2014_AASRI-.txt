Addressing the challenge of tailoring learning experiences in intelligent automated educational systems (IAES) requires the development of specialized decision-making methods. This paper proposes the implementation of comprehensive individualization in learning, encompassing assessment, personalized learning path management, adaptation of curriculum and test composition, and the synthesis of human-machine dialogues, using afferent process simulation. The article examines the issue of reconciling the goals of learner, teacher, and tutor models within the existing learning environment, and presents a four-stage IAES-based decision-making scheme and a cognitive map synthesis mechanism for knowledge diagnostics (CMKD). It also discusses the challenges associated with CMKD synthesis and visualization, and provides the results of testing the proposed technologies in learning.

Despite the advancement of modern intelligent automated training systems, individualized learning in education is still not fully integrated and often serves as a complement to traditional educational methods. While e-learning resources available through global and corporate computer networks provide access to learner-oriented didactic materials capable of addressing individual goals, the effective utilization of these individualized net-training resources necessitates comprehensive analysis of the learning environment and decision-making by the intelligent automated educational/training system solver.

The IAES, as a core component of individualized learning, consists of various elements, such as e-course translator, training subsystem, control subsystem, interfaces, database, solver, and knowledge base models, designed to facilitate presentation, consolidation, and control of didactic materials through individualization, online guidance, adaptation, and flexible man-machine dialog. The paper emphasizes the need for an effective decision-making mechanism, implemented by the system's solver to address conflicting interests between the learning problem (represented by the e-learning developer's model) and the learner's individual goals (student model).

To facilitate decision-making processes in individualized learning, the paper suggests the implementation of a comprehensive logic display (f) to organize expert judgments using advanced computing capabilities, such as weighted ontology. It proposes a unified approach to the complex processing of original data on student-IAES interactions to inform decision-making processes in individualized learning.

The paper highlights the significance of CMKD, which is processed by IAES solver to make decisions or reconstruct the map when necessary. The IAES window represents the discipline's structure, incorporating dynamic and calculated characteristics of the learning environment, with semantic layers responsible for grouping, normalizing, and visualizing pooled data. The basic semantic layers include integrated, competence, assessment, profiling, and others, which provide meaningful data for decision-making in individualized learning.

The paper underscores the importance of further research into the methodological, technological, and technical potential of intelligent algorithms application for the integrated automation of individualized learning. It emphasizes that resolving conflicts between the target plans of student, teacher, and tutor models requires enhancing decision-making technology in the core learning system. The paper proposes a variant for organizing such technology.
