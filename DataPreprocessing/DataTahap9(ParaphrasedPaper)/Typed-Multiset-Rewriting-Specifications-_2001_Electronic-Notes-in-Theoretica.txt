This paper introduces a comprehensive redesign of msr with the aim of establishing it as a practical specification framework for complex security protocols. The key innovations include the adoption of a flexible yet powerful typing methodology that incorporates persistent information predicates, and the introduction of memory predicates that significantly broaden the applicability of this formalism. This language, referred to as typed msr, fully encompasses previous versions of msr. The paper details the language's execution semantics and discusses various applications, such as access control policies and the specification of the intruder model.

The paper formalizes the concept of messages, describing their core components and the typing infrastructure necessary to make sense of these messages. It outlines the formalism based on the type-theoretic notion of dependent product types with subsorting, which is used to define the typing machinery that best fits the goals of msr. The paper also introduces the concept of states, which are fundamental to the snapshots of a protocol execution and are transformed by rewrite rules to simulate message exchange and information update.

Additionally, the paper provides a formalization of the dolev-yao intruder, a widely accepted standard abstraction of an attacker, within the msr framework. It details the capabilities and limitations of the dolev-yao intruder, as well as its formalization using msr. The paper also presents an optimized variant of the dolev-yao intruder model and hints at its correctness.

Furthermore, the paper outlines future directions for the development of msr, including expanding case studies to encompass various security protocols, developing an operational execution model for simulation and model checking, and designing support for type reconstruction to facilitate protocol formalization.

The paper's appendix collects the grammatical productions, judgments, and rules used throughout the paper, providing a convenient reference for readers.
