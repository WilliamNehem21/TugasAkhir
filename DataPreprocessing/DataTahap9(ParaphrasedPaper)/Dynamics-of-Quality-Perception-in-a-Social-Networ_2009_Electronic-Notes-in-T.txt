The system's behavior is influenced in a complex manner by its sub-units, and understanding this complexity may require a paradigm shift, as the overall laws governing the system cannot be simply deduced from observing its individual components. In contrast to this non-trivial interdependence, much of the social sciences literature employs a linear approach to complex systems, which may explain the limited variance explanation seen in many regression models used in service quality studies.

Agent-based models (ABMs) offer a valuable tool for modeling such complex systems. ABMs consist of computational agents operating in parallel, each following internal states and behavioral rules, and interacting with an environment using a communication language. By specifying a network of connectivity and activating agents, emergent macro-behaviors can be observed. These models allow for the creation of artificial societies where basic social structures and group behaviors emerge from interactions between individual agents in artificial environments.

One example of such modeling is cellular automata, where communication between constituent cells is limited to local interactions within a discrete state space. Cellular automata provide a way to simulate the emergent behaviors of interacting elements, such as clients and service providers in service delivery, and can help understand the factors and behaviors affecting the service cycle.

The study presented a simulation model using cellular automata, applying it to quantitative survey data on service quality in aesthetics clinics to understand the dynamics of information exchange among clients and providers. Effective transmission of information is important for establishing patterns that lead to positive evaluations of service quality, and the simulation model aimed to capture this process.

The study also explored the weaknesses of role theory, particularly its oversimplified view of communicative behavior and performance, and the critique that it does not provide sufficient understanding to evaluate communication quality. The authors argued that role theory's simplicity may contradict complexity theory, as complex phenomena can arise from interactions among simple components.

The article discussed the process of selecting rules for the cellular automata simulation and how the model revealed insights into the dynamics of opinions and behaviors within the social network of service providers and customers. It also highlighted the impacts of certain indicators, such as honesty, on the satisfaction and dynamics of the network.

The results presented perspectives on the causal relations within management research, discussing the implications of linear and nonlinear interactions among individuals in the network. The study also illustrated how dissatisfied individuals can influence and spread dissatisfaction within the network, and how managers can use this information to manage problematic customers and employees to maintain service quality.

The study noted the increased kurtosis and negative skewness in both the real data and simulation output, indicating more extreme behaviors characteristic of environments with high service involvement. This behavior was attributed to inconsistencies in mood and service delivery, as well as a process of mutual adaptation over interactions.

Furthermore, the study discussed the impact of customer involvement on service quality and analyzed the limitations of the simulation model, particularly the absence of consideration for competition, which could impact the model's stability.

The findings also highlighted nonlinear relations among individuals and how they can influence attitudes within the network, emphasizing the importance of adopting a nonlinear approach in the study of such systems.

In summary, the study presented a simulation model using cellular automata to understand the dynamics of service quality perception in aesthetics clinics. The results revealed insights into the influence of various factors on the social network and highlighted the importance of managing dissatisfied individuals to maintain service quality.
