The increasing demand for plastics in various applications such as packaging, construction materials, and consumer goods, as well as hygiene products, has led to challenges in waste management. These conventional petroleum-derived plastics, made from crude oil, are derived from non-renewable resources. Although plastic can be recycled, the accumulation of non-degradable waste poses serious environmental hazards. As a result, there has been a growing interest in the industrial-scale production of biodegradable polymers. Unlike oil-based polymers, biodegradable polymers possess the ability to be broken down by soil microorganisms, leading to the conversion of carbon and nitrogen into carbon dioxide and water vapor through enzymatic action.

In this study, a local isolated bacterial strain was utilized for the production of polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) using fructose as a carbon source and various nitrogen sources. Experimental designs were formulated to screen different carbon and nitrogen sources, and the responses were measured in terms of optical density and PHB production. The study found that maltose, ammonium sulfate, fructose, and ammonium chloride were the most significant factors for bacterial growth and microbial biopolymer accumulation. Furthermore, the study suggested a chemically defined production medium using these factors to optimize PHB production.

Based on the generated mathematical models, the optimum conditions for PHB production were estimated and experimentally verified. The study also investigated the pathways affecting the availability of substrates for PHB synthesis and found that the shutdown of certain pathways could enhance PHB production. Additionally, the study reported promising results from batch cultivation in a bioreactor, demonstrating a substantial increase in PHB production prior to optimizing the bioreactor conditions.

In conclusion, the study focused on enhancing the productivity of the biodegradable polymer PHB from a local bacterial isolate using design of experiments (DOE) tools. The findings suggest the potential for this isolate to be a high producer of PHB for industrial-scale production.
