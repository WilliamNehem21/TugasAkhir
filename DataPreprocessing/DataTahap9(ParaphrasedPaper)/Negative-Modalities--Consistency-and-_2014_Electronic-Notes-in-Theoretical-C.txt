In the context of our fundamental system kn, an equivalent outcome may not attempt to restore all traditional inferences. A potential alternative in this scenario would involve a less powerful system, which we will briefly touch upon. Let dm denote the system formed by adding rules (dm1.1), (dm1.2), (dm2.1), and (dm2.2) to system dl, let dmi represent dm extended by (dm3.1), and let dme denote dm with the addition of (dm3.2). Including both (dm3.1) and (dm3.2) would be suitable for formulating complete systems where each of those axioms could be introduced separately. An apparent solution to addressing the challenge associated with frame incompleteness is to alter the semantic framework. This approach is commonly seen in the literature on intuitionistic modal logic systems, where a second relation (a quasi ordering) is incorporated into the frame, accompanied by the consideration of truth-increasing valuations. This approach is well motivated and would enable the proof that truth is inherited toward the future based on the order introduced by the second relation, and falsity is inherited toward the past based on the same order (for the positive case, refer to; for an application to the case of our modal negations, refer to). In addition to highlighting the hereditary conditions, the supplementary benefit of this revised framework is that it enables the incorporation of each axiom separately and facilitates the independent consideration of the two non-classical negations. However, this strategy cannot be straightforwardly extended to our more complex language. This is because the restoration connectives were intentionally designed to fail the hereditary conditions, as they enable the recovery of standard classic-like models when applied to sentences of a given theory. Consequently, the identification of the appropriate semantic framework for studying ex- 

To be comparatively complete; a similar phenomenon arises when (~/) is introduced, and negation is no longer paraconsistent; if both rules are incorporated, classical logic is derived. If we start from dm, a four-valued semantics remains feasible, but negation becomes non-deterministic: each of the four inputs has two potential outputs. This indeterminacy in negation can be partially resolved by adding rules (dm3.1) or (dm3.2); adding both rules would lead to complete determinization corresponding to De Morgan logic. Conversely, our non-classical negations follow a different path by
