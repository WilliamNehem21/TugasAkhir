The paper presents an axiomatization of the timed interval calculus, which is a set-theoretic notation for expressing properties of time intervals. This axiomatization is then implemented in the Ergo theorem prover to facilitate machine-checked proofs of laws for reasoning about predicates expressed using interval operators. The resulting laws can be used for machine-assisted verification of real-time applications.

In recent years, formalisms based on time intervals have seen increased use in specifying real-time systems. However, the complexity of manual proofs has made their use in verification challenging. There is a need to express such calculi in an environment that offers automated theorem proving capabilities. Previous attempts in this direction only include an early implementation of the duration calculus in the PVS theorem prover.

The authors define an axiomatization of the timed interval calculus (TIC), which is a set-theoretic notation for expressing properties of time intervals based on previous work by Mahony and Hayes. Many useful laws for reasoning about predicates expressed in TIC have been developed and utilized in verifying a variety of real-time systems. However, these laws require a more precise characterization to enable their implementation in a theorem prover. The authors' axiomatization provides the infrastructure for such an implementation, which has been carried out using the Ergo theorem prover.

The paper discusses specific axioms, such as i5, i6, and i7, which ensure properties of time intervals. The authors also emphasize the use of functions from the time domain and the time interval domain to model the dynamic behavior of observable system properties within TIC. They introduce a mechanism to extend properties to subintervals, enhancing proving capabilities. Additionally, the paper details the implementation of various theories, such as time, intervals, and lifting, in separate files with a total of around 1000 lines of code.

The paper also highlights the relationship between union, disjunction, intersection, and conjunction, and the implications for the distribution of universal quantification in conjunctions and disjunctions. Finally, the authors express their gratitude to individuals who contributed to the research and acknowledge the support received for the research.
