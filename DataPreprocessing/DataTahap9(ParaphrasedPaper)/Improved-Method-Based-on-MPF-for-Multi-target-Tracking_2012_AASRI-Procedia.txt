The particle filter algorithm has limitations in consistently addressing the multi-modality problem and often encounters particle degeneracy issues. To overcome these challenges, this study introduces the use of a mixture particle filter (MPF) to model the target distribution as a non-parametric mixture model. Additionally, the computational complexity of the particle filter algorithm is reduced by employing the Gaussian particle filter (GPF). The particle set is generated by sampling the Gaussian density function instead of re-sampling, which enhances the computational efficiency of the particle filter algorithm. The proposed GM-MPF algorithm, which combines the advantages of GPF and MPF, aims to improve the real-time performance of MPF for multi-target tracking. Experimental results demonstrate that the GM-MPF algorithm effectively addresses the challenges of multi-modality and particle degeneracy while achieving real-time multi-target tracking.

The GPF algorithm is effective in reducing complexity but does not fully mitigate particle degeneracy issues. Previous experiments have indicated that the traditional particle filter (PF) alone is unable to solve the multi-modality problem, as evidenced in the experimental results section. As a solution, the MPF is proposed to facilitate multi-target tracking, as the PF algorithm is unable to achieve this due to particle transfer to a single object during the tracking process.

Multi-target tracking is achieved by integrating Gaussian distribution with MPF in this study. The MPF algorithm is employed to track multiple objects using a specific number of particles (n) allocated to each object (m). The particles are divided into m intervals, and the posterior distribution of each interval is approximated using Gaussian distribution to enable multi-target tracking.

The study addresses the limitations of the particle filter algorithm, such as the multi-modality problem and particle degeneracy, by introducing the MPF and emphasizing the importance of the effective number of particles (Neff). It also utilizes GPF to reduce the computational complexity of the algorithm and improve estimation accuracy. The proposed GM-MPF algorithm, which combines GPF and MPF, is shown through experimental results to enhance the real-time performance and accuracy of the system for multi-target tracking.
