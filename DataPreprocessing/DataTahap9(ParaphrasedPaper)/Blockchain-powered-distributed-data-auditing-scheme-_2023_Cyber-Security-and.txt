The use of blockchain technology offers a potential solution for ensuring data integrity in cloud-edge healthcare systems. Each hospital server has the capability to function as a node within a blockchain network, contributing to the consensus process and maintaining a distributed ledger for data integrity auditing. Cloud-edge computing represents an important architecture for a healthcare system that shares data, while blockchain technology serves to support tamper-proofing and prevent collusion.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 covers related work, Section 3 presents the proposed scheme, Section 4 outlines the experimental results and performance evaluation of the proposed scheme, and Section 5 provides a summary of the paper along with a discussion of future plans.

We propose a novel integrity verification scheme for dynamic data updates based on a Merkel hash tree (MHT). This scheme enables public auditing and reduces certain overheads, but is vulnerable to replacement attacks. Mao et al. have enhanced the MHT and introduced a position-aware Merkel tree (PMT) that includes position information in each node to counter replacement attacks. Rao et al. have designed a dynamic audit scheme based on batch authentication MHT to address the issue of collusion. Additionally, Bowers et al. and Gao et al. have proposed schemes that support data deduplication and cloud data auditing, respectively.

Transactions within the proposed system are carried out by authenticated users, thereby preventing malicious abuse of privacy attributes, and enabling the tracking of malicious users. Xu et al. have proposed a public cloud auditing scheme that periodically updates the audit authorization code to prevent tampering by malicious clouds.

Two blockchain-based data integrity verification frameworks have been proposed that follow a similar approach based on the Merkel tree and sampling, but with no guaranteed success rate of verification. In response to this limitation, we have designed a new scheme to enhance the success rate.

The proposed system framework involves three key roles: users, hospital servers, and cloud servers. Users, such as doctors and patients, are considered trustworthy and upload their data to the nearest hospital servers for data integrity verification. Hospital servers conduct the verification process and participate in the blockchain consensus, while the cloud server is semi-trusted and responsible for setting initial system parameters and generating the genesis block. Additionally, the blockchain technology is distributed without the need for a trusted third party and provides the benefits of tamper-proofing and anti-collusion.

The proposed scheme includes two phases: 

- In Phase 1, hospital servers and the cloud server generate their public and private keys, hash their public keys as their addresses, and broadcast the public keys and addresses to the other servers. The cloud server then assigns an order to the hospital servers and generates the genesis block, which includes relevant information and is sent to all hospital servers.

- In Phase 2, users generate public and private keys, hash the public key as their address, process data for verification, and upload the data to the nearest hospital server, sending the verification information to the blockchain. Following consensus, the verification information is stored on the blockchain across all edge servers.

The proposed scheme incorporates the initialization of various system parameters, such as hash functions and block structures. It also features three block types: genesis block, data upload block, and data verification block, each serving a specific purpose.

The scheme includes measures to prevent attacks, such as sybil attacks and collusion attacks, effectively safeguarding against the forgery of identities and data loss. The experimental results demonstrate a high verification rate even in the presence of malicious nodes, confirming the scheme's resilience to collusion attacks.
