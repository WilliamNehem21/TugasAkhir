The graph convolutional network (GCN), which directly operates on a graph and generates embedding vectors for nodes based on their neighborhood properties (Kipf and Welling, 2016), has a major limitation in that it is inherently transductive. In contrast, GraphSAGE is an inductive framework that can quickly produce embeddings and make predictions for unseen data, but it faces difficulty in improving predictive performance with stacked GraphSAGE layers due to the over-smoothing problem. On the other hand, the Residual Neural Network (ResNet), a classical deep convolution neural network (CNN) known for its strong feature extraction, addresses the vanishing gradient problem using identity mappings, and the embedded ResNet module can serve as a buffer layer to mitigate the over-smoothing issue in GraphSAGE layers (Oono and Suzuki, 2020).

The remaining sections of this paper are structured as follows. Chapter II provides a brief overview of ResNet and GraphSAGE, followed by an explanation of the architecture of the proposed ResGraphNet. Chapter III presents experiments using various datasets to demonstrate the performance of ResGraphNet. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Chapter IV.

The increasing global temperature, driven by extensive fossil energy consumption (Arrow, 2007), poses a challenge for methods that utilize historical data to predict future trends, particularly as it is difficult to capture rapid changes in temperature data over recent years. To address this issue, we introduce the novel architecture of ResGraphNet.

In addition, temperature data are collected using different methods and from various locations, such as ERSSTV4, ERSSTV3b, Berkeley-Earth, HadSST3, and ERA5. These datasets are also utilized to assess the generalization capability of the proposed ResGraphNet.

ResNet is a type of neural network that employs identity mapping. It is established that simply stacking CNN layers cannot indefinitely enhance the performance of the model, primarily due to the vanishing gradient problem (Glorot and Bengio, 2010). To effectively address this issue, the concept of a highway network is proposed.

For regression problems, the root mean square error (RMSE) is commonly used as an evaluation metric. However, the RMSE is susceptible to the characteristics of the data being analyzed. When there are significant differences in the value distributions of different time series, comparing the testing results of these time series becomes challenging due to their varying magnitudes of RMSE.

This chapter begins by presenting the training and test datasets based on real-time series data. Subsequently, models are constructed using different algorithms, and their parameters are set. Finally, the training dataset is used to train each model, and the test dataset is employed to evaluate the model performance.

Twelve models, including the proposed ResGraphNet, ResNet, GraphSAGE, the graph neural network with unified message passing model (UNIMP), GCN (Kipf and Welling, 2016), Graph Isomorphic Network (GIN), the recurrent neural network with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), the recurrent neural network with Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Random Forest Regression (Forest), Linear Regression (Linear), ARIMA, and SARIMAX are applied.

The results show that the proposed ResGraphNet can reasonably predict future unknown temperature data to some extent, with January, February, and March having RMSE values of 0.0015, 0.0109, and 0.0048, respectively, and a high similarity in annual temperature. However, two challenges remain unresolved in this paper. Firstly, an optimal method for selecting the most suitable graph structure for specific data, such as temperature time series, has yet to be determined. Secondly, long-term temperature series prediction has not been addressed. As a result, further improvements are needed to enhance the model performance.
