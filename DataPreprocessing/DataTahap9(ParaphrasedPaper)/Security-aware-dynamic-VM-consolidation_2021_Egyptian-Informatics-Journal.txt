In recent years, there has been considerable interest in cloud computing solutions due to their ability to provide cost-effective on-demand computing resources through a pay-as-you-go model. However, the rapid growth of cloud usage has led to a significant increase in energy consumption by data centers, with estimates suggesting that these facilities consume approximately 1% of global electricity. This escalating energy usage poses substantial challenges for energy management within data centers.

While numerous studies have explored dynamic virtual machine consolidation (DVMC) as a viable approach to addressing energy consumption challenges in data centers without breaching service level agreements, there has been limited attention given to the potential negative impact of DVMC on security. Although DVMC effectively saves energy by migrating running virtual machines from underloaded hosts to other active hosts and transitioning underloaded hosts to a low-power state, it also raises security concerns when consolidating multiple virtual machines belonging to different users on the same physical machine. Such consolidation can introduce new security risks, as demonstrated by prior research indicating that vulnerable virtual machines can serve as entry points for attacks on the host hypervisor and other co-resident virtual machines.

Given the complex interplay between energy consumption, quality of service, and security in cloud computing, there is a need for further research that considers security alongside energy and quality of service considerations. To address this gap, this paper presents a three-dimensional security assessment model and proposes the Secure Dynamic Virtual Machine Consolidation (SDVMC) approach. The SDVMC approach involves two main modules: the Security Monitoring and Management (SMM) module, which leverages the security assessment model to continuously monitor and update security scores for all virtual machines in the data center, and the SDVMC module, which aims to optimize dynamic virtual machine consolidation by addressing host underload and overload, virtual machine selection, and placement.

To evaluate the proposed approach, we used the CloudSim simulator and made minor modifications to its default power-aware best fit decreasing order (PABFD) virtual machine placement algorithm and power model for physical machines. Our simulation results indicate that the SDVMC approach offers significant security improvements while effectively balancing energy consumption and overall security. Furthermore, the approach can achieve security enhancements without adversely impacting energy consumption or quality of service.

In comparison, the work of Jin Han et al. proposed a security assessment model considering hypervisor vulnerabilities, network connections between virtual machines, and co-resident virtual machine effects, along with a multi-objective virtual machine placement approach using genetic algorithms. However, their approach only considers static virtual machine placement and may not be suitable for addressing the real-time nature of dynamic virtual machine consolidation. Our proposed SDVMC approach overcomes these limitations by consolidating running virtual machines into the minimum number of hosts, ensuring that the risk increase for each virtual machine does not exceed a predetermined threshold and aiming to minimize overall risk while maintaining security constraints.

In summary, this paper contributes a comprehensive security assessment model and proposes an SDVMC approach to improve the security of dynamic virtual machine consolidation in cloud computing environments. The proposed approach effectively balances security, energy consumption, and quality of service, making it a promising solution for enhancing the overall security of cloud data centers.
