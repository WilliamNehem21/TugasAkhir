In relation to these difficulties, the present paper suggests a new method of utilizing belief-network (also known as Bayesian network) to reduce reliance on rules and learning algorithms such as reinforcement learning for IoT edge controllers. The efficacy of this probabilistic approach for learning from experiences has been previously discussed.

For instance, in a smart farming scenario, the controller would gather raw data from sensors, such as information about water conditions. The controller would then contextualize the raw data into contextual information (ConIn), and use this knowledge to take actions, such as determining when and for how long to water the crops. Context information is further processed to carry out these actions, representing the low-level intelligence provided by the edge controller.

The learning experiences are then used for learning and/or prediction, particularly in cases where there is missing contextual information. In such instances, the associated contextual information (AConIn) is obtained based on the available contextual information, which then determines whether to predict or learn an action.

In the realm of the Internet of Things, there has been a growing emphasis on edge analytics in contrast to cloud-based solutions, due to the need for computations and analytics closer to the devices. The paper introduces an AI-based distributed intelligence assisted Future Internet of Things Controller (FITC) that employs both edge and cloud-based intelligence. The edge controller provides low-level intelligence, while the cloud controller offers high-level intelligence.

In addition to the findings presented in this paper, future work may involve: validating FITC's performance by incorporating a cloud controller alongside the edge controller; developing a distributed edge controller for large-scale IoT applications; extending learning beyond experiences to include other actions; and incorporating multi-modal context-aware reasoning to utilize edge controllers for various IoT applications. Furthermore, it would be worthwhile to investigate the dynamic behavior of the controller.
