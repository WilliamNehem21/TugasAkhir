This paper seeks to address the deficiency by synthesizing existing findings on the primitive recursiveness of real numbers from literature. Additionally, it introduces new properties of primitive recursively representable (P.R.) real numbers and systematically examines how the primitive recursiveness of real numbers is affected by different representations.

The paper first provides an overview of the representations of real numbers to be discussed. It outlines the classical form of these representations and explains that, due to the focus on making the representations effective at different levels, they are defined in a consistent manner based on a given class of functions. The choice of the class of functions affects the computability levels associated with real numbers, and these notions are also influenced by the specific representations chosen.

The representations of real numbers mentioned above involve functions mapping natural numbers to natural numbers or to rational numbers. As a result, any concept of effectiveness related to these functions can naturally extend to the real numbers represented by them. This extension is demonstrated in the paper as follows:

Let b x = fx(b, 0) when x is not a rational number (i.e., not in the form x = m/b^k). By Theorem 6.1 and the Beatty function of x, it is established that x is a Dedekind P.R. (primitive recursively representable) real number. If x is rational, then x is evidently a Dedekind P.R. real number as well.
