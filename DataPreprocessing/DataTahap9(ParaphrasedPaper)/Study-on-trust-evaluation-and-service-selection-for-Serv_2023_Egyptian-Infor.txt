Managing trust in IoT systems is an area of interest for researchers, and one potential approach is to develop a method for identifying reliable service providers from a large number of smart nodes offering similar services. In this paper, the authors propose a Trust-Based Service Ranking Scheme (TBSRS) as an intelligent solution to evaluate and rank service providers based on trust, even in the absence of assessment data or when faced with untrustworthy recommendations. TBSRS utilizes a binary fruit fly optimization algorithm to rank service providers and demonstrates superior convergence, accuracy, and resilience compared to other existing trust models for IoT systems.

One of the challenges in evaluating the trustworthiness of new services in service-oriented e-commerce systems is the scarcity of data. Most trust models address this issue by assigning an initial trust value to new services, but determining this initial trust value is a difficult task. The authors propose TBSRS as a solution to this problem, highlighting its ability to offer accurate trust evaluation and service ranking even without assessment data or when faced with untrustworthiness recommendations.

The paper is organized as follows: Section II reviews previous work, Section III presents the TBSRS scheme, Section IV describes the experimental evaluation of TBSRS, and Section V discusses conclusions and future work. Experimental results indicate that TBSRS outperforms existing models in terms of the percentage of trustworthy nodes selected as service providers for new services. Additionally, TBSRS demonstrates improved precision of service selection as the trustworthiness of new services is accurately evaluated over time.

The authors' experiments also analyze the impact of the percentage of malicious nodes on the precision of service selection, showing the effectiveness of TBSRS in selecting reliable service providers even in the presence of malicious nodes. The results demonstrate the potential of TBSRS in addressing the challenges of trust management in IoT systems and optimizing service selection processes.
