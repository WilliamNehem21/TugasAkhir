This academic paper discusses graph searches and their corresponding search trees, which are important in various graph algorithms. The authors investigate the problem of determining whether a given spanning tree of a graph is the search tree of a particular search on the graph. They show that this problem is efficiently solvable for DFS trees, and a linear time algorithm for BFS trees was obtained. The paper proves that the search tree problem is in P for LDFS, but shows NP-completeness for LBFS, MCS, and MNS. The authors also provide linear time algorithms for these searches on split graphs.

The paper focuses on connected searches, such as BFS and DFS, and introduces more sophisticated searches like LBFS, LDFS, MCS, and MNS. The authors emphasize the significance of search trees, as they can be used for various purposes, such as determining shortest paths and performing planarity testing of graphs. Additionally, the paper explores the end-vertex problem, which involves determining whether a given vertex can be visited last by a graph search method. The end-vertex problem has connections to multi-sweep algorithms and has been studied extensively, with NP-hardness results shown for various graph classes and search methods.

The paper's main contributions include extending the tree recognition problem to LBFS, LDFS, MCS, and MNS for L-trees, showing NP-hardness results for most of these searches on general graphs, and providing polynomial time recognition algorithms for L-trees of LDFS on general graphs, as well as linear time algorithms for the F-tree and L-tree problem on split graphs for various searches.

Furthermore, the authors discuss the structure of trees, including caterpillar trees, and provide algorithms for determining whether a given spanning tree is an L-tree of LDFS on a graph. They also explore the complexity of the F-tree problem, showing NP-completeness for LBFS, MCS, and MNS, and providing linear time algorithms for split graphs. The paper concludes by discussing possible directions for future research, including the transfer of results from the end-vertex problem to the tree-recognition problem and the exploration of variants of the search tree recognition problem, such as the problem with a fixed starting vertex and the unlabeled problem.

In summary, the paper provides insights into the structural properties of graph searches and their search trees and offers contributions to the understanding of the complexity of the search tree recognition problem, as well as potential areas for further investigation.
