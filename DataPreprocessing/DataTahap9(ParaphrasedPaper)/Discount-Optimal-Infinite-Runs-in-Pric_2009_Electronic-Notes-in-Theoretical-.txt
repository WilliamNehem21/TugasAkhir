Over the past ten years, significant research has been conducted on the application and adaptation of timed automata technology [1,6,9,10,13]. In particular, the timed automata method has proven to be effective in addressing scheduling problems which can often be reformulated in terms of reachability. The concept of priced timed automata has been introduced to address optimal scheduling, wherein the underlying timed automaton is enhanced with prices on locations and transitions, representing the varied rates at which accumulated costs increase during the behaviors of the timed automaton [7,4].

Our approach to achieving optimality in infinite behaviors differs, as we employ the principle of discounting, where the impact of a specific behavior on the overall cost is determined by its occurrence in the distant future. Discounting is a well-established principle in economics and has been utilized in the context of timed automata [e.g., seen in reference]. 

To determine discount-optimal infinite paths in priced timed automata, we simplify the problem to computing discount-optimal infinite paths in finite weighted graphs. This problem is a specialized form of the discounted payoff games discussed elsewhere [cite]. In this section, we present the results upon which we rely; for the reduction, refer to section 5.

Several unresolved issues persist. Our proof of computability is based on regions and corner points and does not offer a foundation for efficient implementation. In [citation], the authors demonstrate that discount-optimal infinite runs possess a fixed-point characterization, which, in conjunction with the concept of priced zones explored in [citation], could potentially enable the development of efficient, zone-based algorithms for computing discount-optimal infinite runs.
