This paper discusses the analysis of a malware distribution network (MDN) using a set of fully qualified domain names (FQDN) aimed at globally spreading malicious files to infect and compromise systems. The study focuses on subsets of connected FQDNs, referred to as malicious clusters (m-clusters), and provides a temporal topological analysis of an MDN with malware attribution. The researchers created a unique dataset over an eight-month period and utilized the transparency report repository of Google Safe Browsing and VirusTotal to facilitate the analysis. The temporal analysis revealed persistent large clusters involved in malware distribution, with sustained topological structures over extended time periods. This finding suggests a continuous effort by malicious actors to maintain such structures for facilitating long-term data flow monitoring post initial identification of malicious FQDNs.

The authors emphasize that their data fusion approach led to the development of new observable knowledge, providing unique temporal insights on the structure, tendencies, and data flows of an MDN. They also highlight that their work contributes to existing literature by leveraging a novel data fusion implementation of public data sources to gain insights into the temporal evolutions of FQDN topological structures actively hosting and transmitting malware. Furthermore, the study reports on the success of previous research in analyzing web-based malware delivery mechanisms and the relationships between domains, IP addresses, and other network components used in malware distribution.

To gather their data set, the researchers fused static data collected from Google Safe Browsing and VirusTotal over an eight-month period. They observe the evolution of several clusters within the MDN and highlight the sustained existence and preservation of FQDN-based topological structures involved in the transmission of multiple malicious data flows. Additionally, the study notes the prevalence of isolated clusters within the MDN network and highlights the critical role of bridge and hub constructs in routing traffic from root nodes to leaf nodes. The research also discusses the composition of malware distributed across clusters, and emphasizes the increased survivability of clusters when multiple isolated clusters are in use.

The authors conclude that their work offers valuable insights into sustained malware distribution in MDNs and lays the foundation for suggested prevention approaches. They acknowledge the limitations of their analysis being based on publicly-accessible data from Google Safe Browsing and VirusTotal, and outline areas for future research, including the enrichment of the dataset, analysis of the dataset as an indicator of malicious cyber events, and the creation of new temporal MDN datasets using publicly available data.
