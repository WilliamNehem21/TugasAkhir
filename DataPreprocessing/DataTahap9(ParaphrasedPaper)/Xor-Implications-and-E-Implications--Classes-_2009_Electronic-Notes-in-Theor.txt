The exclusive or (XOR) operation holds significance in computer programming, serving as a fundamental operation in various encryption algorithms such as DES, Blowfish, RC5, CAST, and Rijndael. The one-time pad encryption algorithm involves combining random plaintext.


Considerable attention in literature has been dedicated to examining the validity of classical logic tautologies in fuzzy logic, particularly those associated with fuzzy implications. Fuzzy implications have been extensively researched and hold importance in diverse domains. Recent studies have explored different classes of fuzzy implications.


In the realm of fuzzy logic, the XOR operation can be utilized to assess the degree to which only one of its immediate antecedents is true. However, autonomous definitions for this fuzzy connective are lacking in the literature, in the sense of being independent from other connectives. In the subsequent discussion, we propose a definition for the fuzzy XOR connective that satisfies the condition of independence.
