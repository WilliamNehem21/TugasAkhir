This academic paper outlines a proposal for using digital technology to enhance communication between sports media organizations and their user communities. The proposal is based on a conceptual model and a proof-of-concept web application. It is posited that the proposed application can enhance sports media web portals with innovative features, strengthen their relationship with users, and utilize the potential contributions of community members. Additionally, the project aims to encourage user participation and the sharing of opinions on sports media web portals.

The model presented in the paper illustrates the open channels of multidirectional communication between key actors, with technology being implicitly incorporated into the model. A web application was developed based on this model, and the role of the editor, although not explicitly represented in the model, is described as a neutral entity responsible for managing and moderating user participation events in line with terms of usage, while ensuring users are managed appropriately.

The paper proposes an approach for boosting user participation in sports media web portals by facilitating open, multidirectional, and regulated communication channels. It is suggested that tools like liberopinion can also have a pedagogic impact by promoting a civic spirit, fostering collaboration and sharing, and supporting open and respectful dialogue.
