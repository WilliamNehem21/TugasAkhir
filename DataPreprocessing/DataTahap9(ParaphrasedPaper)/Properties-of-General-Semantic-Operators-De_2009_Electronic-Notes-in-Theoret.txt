The paper's overall structure consists of several sections. In section 2, the authors discuss finitely-determined operations and demonstrate their application in defining the general semantic operator, tp,c. Section 3 then illustrates how this operator encompasses the three previously mentioned special cases. Section 4 delves into the monotonicity properties of tp,c and its Scott continuity. In section 5, the authors briefly address the computation of tp,c using artificial neural networks. Finally, in section 6, the conclusions of the paper are presented.

The paper also examines the finitely determined nature of various semirings. Semiring (i) represents classical two-valued logic and is finitely determined, while semirings (ii), (iii), and (iv) are not. By utilizing a finite number of truth values and approximations based on a finite number of intervals, semiring (ii) can be considered a finitely-determined logic, and semirings (iii) and (iv) possess finitely-determined disjunctions. Semiring (v) is contingent on the cardinality of a: it constitutes a finitely-determined logic if a is finite, otherwise not.

The paper concludes by examining constraint problems in relation to the general semantic operator and provides an example of a constraint problem that can be transformed into an SCLP (and ultimately solved using an artificial neural network, as outlined in Theorem 5.1). This example demonstrates the applicability of solving a CSP, combining constraints, and projecting over a subset of variables using logic programming methods.
