The role of circulant contraction minors is crucial in determining the idealness of circular matrices with minimal non-ideal structures. This study establishes both necessary and sufficient conditions for a circular matrix 'a' to possess circulant contraction minors, in relation to circuits in a digraph associated with 'a'. Specifically, when 'a' itself is a circulant matrix, our findings offer an alternative characterization of circulant matrices compared to the existing literature.

Perfectness, as a graph property, is hereditary, meaning that any induced subgraph of a perfect graph is also perfect; a similar property extends to their clique-vertex incidence matrices. Similarly, idealness can be shown to be a hereditary matrix property that is retained by minors of the matrix. While this observation has facilitated the characterization of perfect graphs in terms of minimal non-perfect subgraphs, the equivalent characterization of minimally non-ideal matrices has proven more challenging and remains an open problem. Nonetheless, specific results have been obtained for certain classes of matrices.

Additionally, in this study, we proposed a necessary condition for a circular matrix to have a circulant minor and further elaborated on this result. The main contribution of this work is presented in Theorem 4.7, where we provide a complete characterization of circulant minors of circular matrices in terms of directed circuits in its associated digraph. When applied to the subclass of circulant matrices, our findings offer an alternative characterization of circulant minors compared to existing literature.
