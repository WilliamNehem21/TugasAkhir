Analytic calculi are characterized by a set of rules that systematically compose the formulas to be proven. Consequently, proofs derived from an analytic calculus exhibit the subformula property, wherein every formula within the proof must also be a subformula of the formulas intended to be proved. This constraint on the structure of proofs can be leveraged to establish important meta-logical properties of the logical system, such as consistency, decidability, and interpolation.

The process of proof involves demonstrating that if a statement follows from another statement, and in turn a third statement follows from the first, then the third statement also follows from the second. This process can involve the incorporation of intermediate propositions; however, cut-elimination indicates that this deviation through intermediate propositions is unnecessary. Consequently, this implies that proofs can directly follow from the axiomatic theory. Additionally, it implies that systems do not need to make guesses about intermediate propositions. Logically, the elimination of cut often leads to consistency.

It is noteworthy that the cut rule exhibits an inherent duality, wherein the cut formula serves as both a conclusion of a statement and a hypothesis of another. This duality is often preserved throughout the process of cut-elimination in analytic systems. The identification of general methods for detecting such invariants enables the use of meta-level frameworks to uniformly reason about object-level properties.

The introduction rules for modalities pose challenges, particularly due to the fact that the modal rules in such calculi often introduce more than one connective simultaneously, as seen in the standard presentation of the rule k for modal logic k. The introduction rule "!" (commonly referred to as promotion) requires that all the formulas be marked with "?", and it is evident that this rule is not context-independent. This stands in contrast to the rule k in the introduction. The other three rules correspond to dereliction, weakening, and contraction.

The results of cut-elimination in the study at hand do not directly extend previous findings, as the focus here is on a specific class of subexponentials. Similarly, the opposite is also true, evident from the fact that certain aspects like the handling of the rule "k" cannot be adequately addressed. However, it has been shown that for this particular class, the simplicity of the approach is restored while simultaneously addressing subexponentials in a natural manner. This underscores the core concept of cut-elimination: the duality of inference rules.

The integration of object logic (OL) into the logical framework is typically not straightforward. However, the approach adopted in this study offers easily verifiable conditions that ensure the property holds. Future plans involve formalizing these results in Coq, similar to previous work. Additionally, it would be of interest to investigate the case of non-normal modal logics. Furthermore, exploring potential failure cases could provide insights into identifying necessary conditions for cut-elimination at the meta-level. This line of investigation could contribute to defining essential conditions for cut-elimination.
