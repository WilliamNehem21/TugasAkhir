Development tools for program construction have evolved significantly, particularly with the introduction of the CLP scheme for constraint logic programming. Originally proposed by Jaffar and Lassez, this approach combines CP and LP and has been widely successful in CP applications. Building on this foundation, a number of CFLP (Constraint Functional Logic Programming) schemes have emerged since 1991, integrating functional programming capabilities into the mix to create a highly expressive blend of CP, higher-order lazy FP, and LP.
