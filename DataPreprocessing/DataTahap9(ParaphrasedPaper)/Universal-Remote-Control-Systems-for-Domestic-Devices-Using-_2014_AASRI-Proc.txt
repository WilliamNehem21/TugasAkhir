The universal remote control operates in a unicast manner, transmitting messages to individual nodes or devices within the network. It employs a star network architecture, with all devices connected to a central remote but functioning independently of each other.

The current design of the remote control could potentially be leveraged to create an Android application that can be installed and used on smartphones, essentially enabling the smartphone to serve as a universal remote control. Moreover, there is potential for the remote control to be designed with a fully touch screen interface, offering a more modern and visually appealing appearance. Considering ongoing technological advancements, these adaptations could feasibly be integrated in the near future.
