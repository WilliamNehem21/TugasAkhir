Seismic inversion, which involves determining properties like velocity and impedance from seismic data, is a challenging problem due to its ill-posed nature. To address this issue, swarm intelligence (SI) algorithms, such as differential evolution (DE) and particle swarm optimization (PSO), have been increasingly used as a global optimization method. By considering the sparse probability distribution of reflectivity based on well logs, we have proposed a general SI scheme that incorporates constraints based on this prior knowledge to improve the accuracy of potential solutions for seismic inversion. Within this proposed scheme, we have introduced a probability density function library and probability transformation as key operations within standard SI algorithms. Specifically, we have implemented targeted DE-PD and PSO-PD algorithms. Results obtained from numerical examples using the Marmousi2 model and field examples of gas hydrates demonstrate that the DE-PD and PSO-PD algorithms provide better inversion solutions compared to the original DE and PSO algorithms. In particular, the DE-PD algorithm yields the best performance in terms of mean error and fitness value for velocity and impedance inversion. Overall, our proposed SI scheme with sparse distribution constraints shows promise as an effective approach for seismic inversion.

The traditional optimization algorithms based on gradient descent are known to be sensitive to initial model conditions and may easily become trapped in local minima. Additionally, fine-tuning regularization parameters for fast convergence can be a difficult and time-consuming task.

Given the importance of resource exploration and deep drilling, particularly in layered earth models, the assumption of sparsity in the reflectivity distribution is relevant. In depositional areas, the probability density function of reflectivity can be estimated from well logs, and the reflectivity distribution can be assumed to be spatially stationary within such areas. Taking this into account, our proposed SI algorithms with PD constraints, aimed at achieving sparse distribution, show promise for solving the seismic inversion problem. We specifically focus on the DE-PD and PSO-PD algorithms, which incorporate a probability transformation to maintain the distribution of model parameters consistent with the probability density function derived from well data. Results from numerical and field examples demonstrate that the DE-PD and PSO-PD algorithms outperform the conventional DE and PSO algorithms in seismic inversion, with the DE-PD algorithm showing the best performance.

In seismic inversion, the density can sometimes be simplified as a constant, enabling estimation of velocity, impedance, and reflectivity in layered earth models. The choice of inversion parameters depends largely on the specific geological challenges being addressed. Standard SI algorithms typically involve three basic steps: generating an initial population of agents, evaluating each agent's fitness value using a misfit function, and updating the population based on the fitness values for selection.

In our study, we employed four SI algorithms, including DE, DE-PD, PSO, and PSO-PD, to test their performance using a 1-D model numerical example based on a portion of the Marmousi2 model derived from a petroleum sedimentary basin.

To maintain the prior sparse distribution of reflectivity, we introduced a constrained scheme for seismic swarm intelligence inversion, focusing on the targeted DE-PD and PSO-PD algorithms. This constrained scheme utilizes a probability transformation to preserve the distribution of model parameters in line with the probability density function library extracted from well logs, given the spatial stationarity of the sparse reflectivity distribution. Using the same parameters, we applied the four SI algorithms to the Marmousi2 and gas hydrates data, with the results indicating that the DE-PD and PSO-PD algorithms provide better solutions compared to the conventional DE and PSO algorithms. Notably, the DE-PD algorithm exhibited the highest level of accuracy in estimation and convergence speed among the four SI algorithms. However, it should be noted that the DE-PD algorithm had the longest computation time. In future work, we plan to expedite the DE-PD algorithm through parallel computing with GPUs.
