Furthermore, it is necessary to define the morphisms h and g in such a way that they can uniformly generate all potential input words for any input word w. As a result, the process is inherently nondeterministic, but this is acceptable since the morphisms are permitted to be noninjective.

The aforementioned findings warrant some additional remarks. To begin with, theorem 7.3, even in the instance of biprefix morphisms, was initially demonstrated in [source]. A simpler, more straightforward proof resembling that of a textbook was subsequently presented in [source]. In the latter case, it can be established that p equals 2.
