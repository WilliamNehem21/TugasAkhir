In this academic paper, the authors examine focalization in ludics. They discuss the synthesis of types and behaviors, showing that the map can be seen as a retraction of another map, which is connected to the invertibility of negative connectives. The paper also outlines the fundamental concepts of ludics, such as designs and functionals, and introduces synthetic signatures and connectives, which serve as the basis for studying focalizing and inverting functionals. Additionally, the authors explore logical behaviors, internal completeness, and provide a ludics account of focalization.

In summary, the paper analyzes focalization in ludics, focusing on the synthesis of behaviors and describing focalization as designing functionals (designs) from unsynthesized to synthesized behaviors. Furthermore, it is noted that every focalizing design is a retraction of an inverting design, linking it to the invertibility of negative connectives and formalizing the intuition that focalization of positive connectives is dual to the invertibility of negative ones.
