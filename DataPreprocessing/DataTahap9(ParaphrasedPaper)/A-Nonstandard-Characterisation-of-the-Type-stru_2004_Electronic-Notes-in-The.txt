A different method for organizing this hierarchy involves algebraic domains with totality, where the underlying domain is created from a collection of closed rational intervals. Normann demonstrated the density theorem for this hierarchy and established its characterization in the Cartesian closed category of Kuratowski limit spaces.

In proving this assertion, we utilize the transfer principle. The argument would have been straightforward if "c" had been a real natural number, but the transfer principle assures us that the argument is equally straightforward for hyperfinite "c."
