Fuzzy cellular automata were initially developed as a model for understanding the effects of disturbances (such as noise, computation errors, mutations, etc.) on the evolution of boolean cellular automata. They have been demonstrated to be valuable for tasks like pattern recognition and for creating images that resemble natural phenomena. This study is a first step towards providing analytical support for the classification of fuzzy cellular automata in terms of periodicity, and it suggests potential research directions. Given the results of the probabilistic interpretation of fuzzy cellular automata, it would be particularly intriguing to explore the significance of non-homogeneous periodic points of weighted average rules (and other fuzzy cellular automata rules) in relation to estimates of the asymptotic density of their corresponding boolean cellular automata. Investigations in this direction are currently in progress.

The direct application of Theorem 3.2 does not pertain to a specific rule because one of the values is inverted before averaging. Therefore, the asymptotic behavior of fuzzy cellular automaton 78 will be derived by identifying a topologically conjugate cellular automaton to which Theorem 3.2 applies. In this case, there are two distinct weighted averages, one for the even indices and another for the odd indices, with weight factors from the other set of values. This structural insight will be utilized to determine the topologically conjugate cellular automaton where Theorem 3.2 can be applied.

Convergence can be demonstrated using sub-arrays, similar to the previous case. However, for each sub-array, the rules involve averaging the inverted values, as seen in rule 27. As a result, it is necessary to consider two steps at a time. The convergence lemma enables a more precise description of the convergence point in the even case.

Rule 46 produces the most compelling results among all fuzzy cellular automata in this group, and it appears to be unique among all elementary cellular automata. Experimental observations indicate that it is the only rule exhibiting periodic behavior of length 4. It utilizes the central value as the weight factor and identifies subautomata where one value is used directly while the other is inverted, resulting in temporally periodic behavior in each of the cellular automata in the cross product.
