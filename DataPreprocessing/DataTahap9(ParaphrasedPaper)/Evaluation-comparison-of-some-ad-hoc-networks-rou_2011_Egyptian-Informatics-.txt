Conducting a thorough performance assessment of ad hoc routing protocols is crucial. This study compares the performance of three ad hoc routing protocols - specifically, aodv, dsr, and lar routing protocols - using the glomosim simulator version 2.03. We assessed all applicable metrics supported by glomosim for these protocols and conducted a comparative performance evaluation. Due to the distinct characteristics of these protocols, it is not always feasible to compare all performance differentials. Nevertheless, the study utilized specific system parameters for comparative analysis of the protocols.

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides a brief overview of related work, Section 3 presents the simulation environment, Section 4 discusses the simulation results and performance analysis, Section 5 introduces the summarized results, and finally, conclusions are presented in Section 6.

The mobility model employed is the random waypoint model, where nodes select random destinations within the terrain range and move toward them at speeds between predefined minimum and maximum values. Upon reaching a destination, a node pauses for a specified time, then selects another destination and speed, and resumes movement. The simulation was conducted with minimum and maximum speeds of 0 and 10 m/s, and varying pause time values from 0 to 300 s. The simulations were performed on a PC with a Pentium IV processor and 3 GB RAM.

AODV exhibits higher average end-to-end delay compared to LAR due to its single path nature and inefficient handling of route failure, while LAR demonstrates lower delays in all cases by forwarding data packets through alternative routes instead of buffering for a new route to be found.

In the simulations, the number of acknowledgment (ACK) packets is increased using LAR and DSR routing protocols between pause times of 100 and 200 compared to the AODV protocol. For a large network size and a pause time of 200, the ACK packets received using the LAR protocol are increased compared to the other two protocols. Notably, the number of ACK packets received for the DSR protocol is lower, as it utilises the optional RREP acknowledgment (RREP-ACK) feature to detect unidirectional links.

The study aimed to compare the three routing protocols rather than identifying the optimal performance in the given scenarios. The findings indicate that the mobility pattern influences the performance of mobile ad hoc network (MANET) routing protocols, consistent with previous studies. However, unlike previous studies that compared different MANET routing protocols under a variety of performance metrics, no clear winner among the protocols emerged in this study, as different performance metrics and network sizes yielded varied performance rankings of the protocols.
