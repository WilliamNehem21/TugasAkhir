The primary drawback of variable structure control (VSC) is the chattering phenomenon, which has been extensively studied in the context of controlling mechanical systems due to the potentially harmful effects of the chattering generated by the switching control input. While VSC offers robust control, efforts have been made to address chattering by proposing soft switching techniques. Although VSC has been widely applied to real uncertain electromechanical systems, its application to electrical energy generation systems is relatively new.

A reliable energy supply is of utmost importance for electrical energy networks, leading to numerous studies dedicated to finding optimal controllers for the automatic voltage regulator (AVR). The AVR system is responsible for maintaining voltage levels despite load disturbances and parameter uncertainties caused by aging. Most controllers have been developed using a commonly preferred linear AVR model without considering the structural constraints inherent in real-world mechanical and electrical systems. Neglecting these constraints can result in deteriorated performance, reduced actuator life, or even system instability. While some publications have emphasized the importance of considering these constraints, the incorporation of such constraints into the AVR controllers remains limited.

Some recent studies have addressed the constraints of the AVR and proposed mathematical models with necessary constraints for academic purposes. These models have been adapted to represent the features of protective devices and have been verified with real AVR systems. Notably, the inclusion of constraints such as control input boundaries and exciter saturation levels has led to the nonlinearization of the linear AVR model. Additionally, recent studies have utilized both linear AVR models and AVRs with specific power ratings and connected to networks via transformers, highlighting the importance of considering constraints in controller design for such systems.

In the current study, a focus is placed on the VSC perspective with the revision of the conventional AVR model according to the specifications of the IEEE recommended excitation model, DC1C. The proposed controller design incorporating soft switching functions is discussed, and an optimization algorithm is selected. The simulation results are presented, and the study concludes with a comparison of the results with previous studies.

The study also addresses the inclusion of protection accessories in the excitation control system models for academic purposes, a consideration rarely seen in AVR studies. The study explores the use of non-model-based algorithms and soft switching functions to mitigate chattering, an aspect that has not been extensively studied in the context of AVR systems.

Furthermore, the study emphasizes the incorporation of input saturation constraints in the controller design procedure and stability proof, presenting unique findings specific to the proposed controller. The study aims to optimize controller parameters to achieve a critically-damped step response with minimal overshoot, considering these features in the definition of an objective function rule.

The use of the sliding mode controller with soft switching functions is proposed and analyzed for its chattering attenuation performance in the AVR system, showing promise in reducing excessive switching activity and minimizing the heating of power electronic components. The study recommends the use of soft functions in switching control laws to ensure optimal performance without risking damage to AVR systems.
