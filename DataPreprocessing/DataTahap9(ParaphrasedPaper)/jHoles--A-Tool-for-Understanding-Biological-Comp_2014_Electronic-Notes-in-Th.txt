Complex networks are widely utilized for studying complex systems, with weighted networks emerging as an increasingly important tool for identifying the presence and intensity of relationships among nodes. Topological data analysis (TDA) is a subfield of computational topology that develops topological techniques for robust analysis of scientific data, where topology is a branch of geometry focused on the study and classification of shapes.

Recently, TDA has been applied to numerous studies of biological systems. For instance, Nicolau et al. have introduced a method to extract information from high-throughput microarray data that utilizes topology to yield more qualitative insights than traditional analytic techniques. This method identified a unique subgroup of estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancers expressing high levels of c-myb and low levels of innate inflammatory genes. In another example, Chan et al. applied topological methods to expand the boundaries of the phylogenetic tree for understanding viral evolution.

While TDA is strong for analyzing weighted networks, it faces computational challenges. Empirical measures have shown that 90% of the execution time is devoted to loading the graph (5-10%) and the filtration process, with the remainder (usually less than 10%) spent on calculating persistent homology. This is mainly due to the clique finding problem, which is NP-complete and involves recomputing maximal cliques for the subgraph at each index. Moreover, this approach is dependent on the graph's density and the number of different weights assigned to edges, posing difficulties for large networks.

To address these issues, a different approach is proposed. It is observed that all cliques in a graph are either a subset of a maximal clique or a maximal clique. Therefore, the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm can be employed for the entire graph, followed by iterating through each maximal clique to find all other cliques. Additionally, the latest version of jHoles enables the calculation of essential network statistics for comparison, classification, and anomaly detection, including size, volume, average degree, maximum degree, clustering coefficient (local and average), negativity, and network weight.

In an application from the year 2000, publicly available flight data between airports was aggregated to define routes based on origin and destination cities, with passenger traffic serving as the reported weight. Furthermore, the gene interaction network utilized in the paper is a sampling of the complete human genome dataset, where each node represents an individual gene and edges correlate the expression levels of genes. The node set of the analyzed network was obtained by randomly selecting an origin node and recursively adding its neighborhood to the set until a specified number of nodes was attained.

Benchmark results on these datasets are illustrated in graphs presented in this section, providing insights into the time taken by jHoles and Holes to process the data. The work represents an interdisciplinary application from algebraic topology to graph theory, and the paper provides mathematical definitions to enhance the presentation and make it self-contained.
