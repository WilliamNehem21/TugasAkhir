To enhance the phellinus linteus fermentation process, the study focused on identifying the optimal conditions for fermentation temperature, inoculum size, rotation speed, and bottling capacity as independent variables, with fermentation yield as the dependent variable. The quadratic regression orthogonal rotating combination design method was utilized to establish a model for the fermentation process. The findings highlighted the influential factors affecting fermentation yield, with fermentation temperature, inoculum size, rotation speed, and bottling volume emerging as crucial determinants. Additionally, a significant interaction was observed between inoculum size and bottling volume. The recommended optimal fermentation conditions for phellinus linteus were a bottling volume of 120ml, an inoculum size of 17ml, a temperature of 26 degrees Celsius, and a rotation speed of 135 revolutions per minute. Under these conditions, the projected maximum fermentation mycelium production was 24.51mg/ml. Experimental results validated the model's good fit with real-world scenarios and its high credibility.

Phellinus igniarius(l.ex fr.) quel, a traditional and enduring medicinal fungus, is infrequently found in its natural form due to biological and environmental limitations. Research has indicated that the polysaccharide component of phellinus linteus is the primary medicinal compound of Phellinus igniarius quel, known for its potent anti-tumor properties. Furthermore, the polysaccharide from mycelium after fermentation exhibits similar efficacy as the fruiting body polysaccharide. Given its short fermentation cycle and lack of seasonal and environmental constraints, fermentation offers a cost-effective approach for developing phellinus linteus.

The fermentation yield of mycelium is closely linked to the fermentation conditions. This study employed fine strains after mutagenesis as the experimental materials and adopted an orthogonal rotation combination design to develop a model for the fermentation process. The model analysis aids in optimizing the fermentation conditions, laying the groundwork for actual production.

In the experimental setup, a 200ml seed medium was placed in a 500ml flask, followed by the introduction of the slope strains for static cultivation in a 28 degrees Celsius incubator. The cultivation process involved shaking the flask in the morning and evening until the medium was uniformly covered by white flocculent mycelium. Upon completion, the flask was stored at 4 degrees Celsius. The seed medium composition comprised 35g glucose, 10g peptone, 5g yeast extract, 1g potassium dihydrogen phosphate, 0.5g magnesium sulfate, and 1000ml water.

Analysis of the model revealed that z1z2 represented the sole significant interaction term, indicating a notable interplay between inoculum size and bottling capacity. At lower bottling capacities, the inoculum size increased, resulting in a gradual rise and intermittent decline in the fermentation yield of phellinus linteus. Conversely, higher bottling capacities led to a rapid increase in the fermentation yield in conjunction with inoculum size, aligning more closely with actual production scenarios.
