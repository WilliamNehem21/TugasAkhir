Investigating the usability of educational virtual reality (VR) is crucial as it can shed light on the adoption of VR as a new technology, offer insight into effective learning mechanisms, and provide recommendations for designing effective educational experiences. This study aimed to assess the usability of an interactive VR field trip among 64 university students learning about simplified construction engineering topics. The research pursued two main objectives. Firstly, it utilized a mixed-methods approach, comprising semi-structured interviews and a survey to evaluate system usability and satisfaction. Secondly, it investigated the quantitative relationships between various variables (such as ease of use, usefulness, presence, and cognitive load) and system usability and satisfaction. The results from the study indicated that the VR field trip was well-regarded as an appropriate instructional method, with positive evaluations in both interviews and surveys. Additionally, the study found that ease of use, usefulness, presence, and extraneous load were predictive of system usability, while satisfaction was associated with usefulness, presence, and intrinsic cognitive load. The study concluded that the variables related to system usability and satisfaction in VR learning environments are diverse and emphasized the need for considerations in educational design and practical implications stemming from the findings.

From a cognitive perspective, the usability of VR learning environments can impact instructional effectiveness, while from an affective standpoint, usability can influence emotions and moods, and from a behavioral angle, usability is critical for the adoption of new educational technologies. Users' inclination to engage with and continue using new educational technologies can be influenced by the usability of such technologies, impacting self-regulated learning. Furthermore, the study discussed the broader topic of technology acceptance theories and highlighted recent advancements in measuring and predicting user acceptance in educational VR.

The study also addressed the critical research gap in the methodology used, underscoring the need for mixed-methods approaches to gather additional insights in educational research. The investigation raised research questions about the level of satisfaction and usability in a VR learning environment, as well as variables connected with system usability and satisfaction.

The study found significant associations between ease of use and usefulness with system usability, noting that extraneous load can reduce the usability of VR learning environments. Additionally, the study revealed that cognitive load and presence are linked to system usability and satisfaction, suggesting that enhancing these aspects could contribute to a more satisfying learning experience in VR environments.

The study acknowledged several limitations, such as the measures used and the focus on learning environments with simple interaction types, and made recommendations for educational design based on the findings. Furthermore, the study proposed potential enhancements to technology acceptance scales for VR and emphasized the need for further exploration of the interdependence of cognitive load and usability variables to provide better guidance to practitioners.
