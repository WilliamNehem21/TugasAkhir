The mechanism of action (MoA) of a compound refers to the biological interaction by which it elicits a pharmacological effect. Multiple data sources, including compound structural information and various assays such as cell morphology, transcriptomics, and metabolomics, can be employed to predict MoA. In this study, we investigated the advantages and potential synergistic effects of combining structural information, represented by Morgan fingerprints, and morphological information, represented by five-channel cell painting image data. For a set of 10 well-represented MoA classes, we compared the performance of deep learning models trained on the two datasets separately with a model trained on both datasets simultaneously. We found that training on both datasets together resulted in a significant improvement in predictive performance, with clear additive/synergistic effects, underscoring the value of integrating multiple data sources for MoA prediction.

A comparative study on library enrichment revealed that cell painting showed better predictive power for high-throughput screening performance compared to L1000 gene expression profiling. However, for MoA prediction, L1000 outperformed cell painting, indicating complementarity between the two assays. Additionally, a study by Lapins and Spjuth compared cell painting, L1000, and chemical structure-based predictors, and found that each predictor performed better for certain MoA classes, supporting the idea of the benefit of integrating different data sources. Another study, which compared models built using image-based features and chemical structure descriptors, further supported the complementarity of these data types.

The cell painting images were standardized to remove plate-level effects, resized, and subjected to quality control. Machine learning algorithms operating on tabular data were also explored, and the traditional machine learning models were found to exhibit competitive performance with deep learning models. The study also highlighted the challenge of predictive performance with a small test set due to data limitations.

The study emphasized the potential benefits of integrating diverse data sources for predicting compound MoA. It suggested that even better predictive models could be achieved with the addition of other data types, such as transcriptomics data, and the exploration of alternative chemical structure representations.

This work represented the first integration of molecular fingerprint data and five-channel fluorescence cell painting image data for MoA prediction using deep learning. The findings demonstrated a significant improvement in predictive performance by combining data sources, emphasizing the importance of such integration for MoA prediction.
