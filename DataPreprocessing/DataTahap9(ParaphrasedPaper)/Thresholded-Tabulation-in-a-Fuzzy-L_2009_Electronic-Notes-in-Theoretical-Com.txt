This academic paper discusses the integration of fuzzy logic and logic programming, proposing an improved fuzzy query answering procedure within the multi-adjoint logic programming approach. The focus is on avoiding the re-evaluation of goals and generating unnecessary computations through the combined use of tabulation and thresholding techniques. The authors adapt the tabulation procedure for propositional residuated logic programs to the general case of multi-adjoint logic programs, addressing issues of termination and efficiency. The thresholding technique is introduced as a way to minimize the complexity of the generated forest and reduce the number and size of trees. By integrating tabulation with thresholding, the paper demonstrates the potential for efficient query answering procedures in the context of multi-adjoint logic programs.
