The fastflow library is a promising C++ library for multicore programming, but it has a design issue related to the use of void* pointers for communication between threads, leading to a lack of type safety. To address this, the library can be enhanced using generative technologies to make it more efficient and safer.

Memory fences are a significant source of performance degradation in communication-intensive parallel applications. While various fence-free solutions exist for asynchronous symmetric communications, extending these results to support arbitrary streaming networks presents a challenge.

Fastflow is a parallel programming framework for multi-core platforms based on non-blocking lock-free and fence-free synchronization mechanisms. It is designed to simplify the development of shared-memory parallel applications and make them fast and scalable, particularly targeting streaming applications.

The abstract class ff_node in fastflow includes a pure virtual method called svc, which is the main method for every thread in the application. However, as the method uses a void* argument, the approach is not type-safe. We propose extending the fastflow library to improve type safety by using the curiously recurring template pattern and making the abstract base class templated.

We present our proposed solution for enhancing the fastflow library to be type-safe and provide implementation details. Our approach eliminates the virtuality of the method and improves the system's efficiency. The use of data pointers instead of data, and the development of a multi-threaded memory allocator optimized for streaming applications, are also discussed.

An example of code utilizing the extended fastflow library is presented, demonstrating the advantages of our solution for type safety and efficiency. We discuss the benefits of static polymorphism and show how it can effectively replace dynamic polymorphism.

We also discuss how our solution addresses the limitations of the original fastflow library, particularly in terms of type safety and performance. By illustrating the high-level pipeline schema and the use of circular and non-circular buffers, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution.

In summary, our proposed solution addresses the weaknesses of the original fastflow library in terms of type safety and efficiency without compromising its multicore functionality.
