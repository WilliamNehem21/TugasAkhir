A recently developed model for random higher-dimensional simplicial complexes, as proposed and researched by Linial, Meshulam, and Wallach, has garnered attention. The fundamental groups of random 2-complexes represent random groups of a relatively diverse nature. The study of this random group model has seen significant advancements by Babson, Hoffman, and Kahle in recent times.
