Optimization is a broad concept utilized across various disciplines, involving intelligent computation methods in different domains to attain the best possible outcomes, such as minimum, maximum, lower cost, higher performance, and so on, depending on the specific problem and the objectives sought by researchers. The definition of optimization can vary depending on the field of application.

Optimization involves the process of achieving the best possible result given certain conditions, and can be categorized into maximization and minimization, single or multi-variable functions, and with or without constraints. There are two types of objective functions in optimization: single objective function and multiple objective function. The fundamental elements of optimization include decision variables, objectives, and constraints. An optimization algorithm is a systematic procedure that is iteratively executed to compare various solutions until an optimal or satisfactory solution is achieved. Various types of optimization exist, such as continuous optimization, bound-constrained optimization, constrained optimization, derivative-free optimization, discrete optimization, global optimization, linear programming, and non-differentiable optimization. Numerous researchers are actively involved in the field of optimization.

Al-janabi and Alkaim have introduced a new tool called "drflls" for locating optimal values for missing data. This involves the development of a random forest algorithm and the definition of seven categories of similarity measures, including person similarity coefficient, simple similarity, and fuzzy similarity (m1, m2, m3, m4, and m5). Al-janabi and Madi have conducted a study using intelligent computation to analyze five prediction data mining techniques in order to determine which one achieves optimal biomedical analysis. This study highlights that mathematical computation is not always the key to finding optimal solutions, as the nature of the data plays a crucial role in determining the optimal approach.

Another development in the field involves the Lion Optimization Algorithm (LOA), which has been enhanced by incorporating a smart feature (such as spirally searching and bubble net searching) to improve accuracy and reduce execution time in achieving the desired goals.
