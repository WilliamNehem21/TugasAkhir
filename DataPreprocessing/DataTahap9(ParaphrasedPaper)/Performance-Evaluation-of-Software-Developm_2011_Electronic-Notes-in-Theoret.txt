The academic paper discusses the analytical modeling of global software development teams and the representation of the central entity and team members. In Section 3, a practical case study is presented to demonstrate the scope and nature of the problem, along with the proposed analytical model. Section 4 includes a comparative numerical analysis of the proposed model with actual project quantitative data. Additionally, Section 4.3 investigates the impact of varying the availability and levels of support provided by the central entity on the total project execution time. The paper concludes by providing an overview of future work and the major contributions of the study.

Analytical modeling formalisms are commonly utilized to describe various real-world situations in a state-based approach. Markov chains and Markov-based formalisms are applied in diverse fields such as economics, physics, engineering, and bioinformatics. Additional information on other formalisms, specialized tools, and applications can be found in the existing literature.

One particular modular and compact markovian formalism is stochastic automata networks (SAN). SAN is employed to model systems through small components (automata) with defined interactions among them in a structured manner. The solution of a SAN model typically involves specific algorithms designed to handle large state spaces, making it conducive for modeling distributed development teams in a software engineering context.

The project faced various challenges and impediments during its execution phase, including the distance factor and the allocation of the central team. These challenges affected the support quality from the central team and the alignment of time-zones, with central team members also being allocated as resources for other projects, resulting in medium to low support quality. The time-zone challenge posed difficulties for members at a given site, leading them to extend or alter their workday window to be available for work.

Quantitative results about Project Alpha were derived from compiling project log files, conducting informal interviews with managers, and administering a survey to collect quantitative information about participant interactions and issues encountered during project phases. The analytical model results were obtained using Project Alpha data to instantiate the event rates.

The probability of working state for senior participants was slightly lower than 87.5%, corresponding to seven hours of work per an eight-hour workday. Junior participants exhibited a working percentage of 14.7%, reflecting a little over one hour of work per eight-hour workday, with the majority of their time spent in seeking solutions. Junior participants collaborated infrequently with the central team, likely due to low availability and low-quality support provided.
