The concept of proof nets was first introduced by Girard in [gir87]. Proof nets provide a comprehensive representation of proofs in linear logic, such that every proof in linear logic has a corresponding proof net, and vice versa. Additionally, proof nets have a well-defined operational semantics based on graph rewriting reduction. In the case of the multiplicative exponential fragment of proof nets, the graph rewriting reduction exhibits strong normalization [gir87] and confluence [laf95], indicating that proof nets can function as a computational system.

Definition 2.2 (Polarized Formulas): An immell formula is defined as a pair ha; pli, where a is a mell formula and pl is an element of f+; g. The elements + and - are referred to as Danos-Regnier polarity. A formula ha; pli can be expressed as apl, and an immell formula is known as a polarized formula. A formula with + (or -) polarity is termed a + -formula (or positive formula) (or -formula, negative formula).

Definition 3.2 (Depth): For a link l in a proof net, the depth of l denoted as d(l), is the count of !-boxes that encompass l. The depth of the entire proof net, denoted as d(), is the maximum of d(l) for any link l. The co-depth, co-d(l), is calculated as d() - d(l).

(d) Consider 01 and 02 as imperial sub-proof-nets of 1 and 2, respectively, each having the same positive conclusion formula c+ located at identical positions in 1 and 2. If the head-formula of the main path of 01 is discharged (or absorbed), it implies that the head-formula of the main path of 02 is discharged (or absorbed), and if both head-formulas are discharged (or absorbed) in both 1 and 2, then they must share the same points of discharge (or absorption) (coincidence of discharge and absorption).
