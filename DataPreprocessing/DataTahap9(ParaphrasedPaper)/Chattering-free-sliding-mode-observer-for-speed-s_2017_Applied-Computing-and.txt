Utilizing advanced engineering expertise in the field of navigation and adhering to stability and reaching criteria, the output of the fuzzy logic system (FLS) is computed using a singleton fuzzification approach, center-average defuzzification, and product inference. The FLS generates output signals through the fuzzy logic controller (FLC) to adjust the sliding function (fs) in order to maintain dynamic observer stability for given input values.

Increased core loss, copper loss, and mechanical friction lead to a rise in stator winding resistances. To assess the resilience of the proposed observer in response to a doubling of motor resistance, a test was conducted by adding a resistor in series with the stator winding and introducing a speed step reference ranging from 400 to 4000 rpm.
