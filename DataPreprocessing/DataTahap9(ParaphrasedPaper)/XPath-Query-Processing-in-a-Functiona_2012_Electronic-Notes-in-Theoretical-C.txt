This paper demonstrates how the specialized query language xpath can be effectively integrated into the functional-logic paradigm. The authors propose a framework within the functional-logic language TOY that allows users to write xpath-like queries as integral components of the language. This framework utilizes higher-order combinators for query construction and non-determinism to handle the multiple responses that xpath queries can yield. The integration of xpath into the functional-logic language TOY enables users to incorporate xml queries into their programs without the need for external libraries or ad hoc interfaces. Additionally, the use of higher-order patterns facilitates the definition of functions for easily processing the queries, including tracing and debugging erroneous queries, as well as detecting query refinements to optimize query processing efficiency.

The paper also discusses the increasing importance of XML and its query languages, particularly xpath and XQuery, and their incorporation into various applications and database management systems. It presents a rule-based language for processing semistructured data embedded in the functional logic language Curry and implements xpath in the functional-logic language TOY, representing an xpath query as both an implementation (code) and a data term.

The authors illustrate how xpath seamlessly aligns with the functional-logic paradigm and elaborate on the implementation of xpath in TOY. They discuss the compatibility of xpath queries within TOY, demonstrating how higher-order combinators and non-determinism are harnessed for diverse query responses. The paper also explores the cross-fertilization of relational databases and the utilization of cached query results to enhance query solving performance. In addition, the paper outlines the function of the operator for applying xpath queries to XML documents, and it discusses the adaptation of xpath syntax in TOY through the defined unitary operators. Furthermore, it highlights the utility of higher-order patterns and the manipulation of xpath queries for tracing and debugging purposes. The paper concludes by expressing future research directions and potential extensions of the proposed implementation.
