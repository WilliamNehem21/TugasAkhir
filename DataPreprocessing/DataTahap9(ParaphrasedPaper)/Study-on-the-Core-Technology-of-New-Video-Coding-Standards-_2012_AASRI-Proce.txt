We present a brief overview of the fundamental principles behind the standardized coding/decoding of h.264/AVC. We have conducted a detailed analysis of the core technology of the h.264/AVC standard, which includes motion estimation and motion compensation, intra-frame and inter-frame prediction, integer transform and quantization analysis, entropy coding methods, deblock filtering, new image types, aspect-oriented IP, and wireless environments. The h.264/AVC standard has effectively addressed the trade-off between image quality and coding efficiency, but its computational complexity has increased as a result. Therefore, achieving higher coding efficiency while simultaneously reducing computational complexity will be a key area of focus for future study. 

In the output bit stream of the encoder, the fundamental unit of data is the syntax element, which consists of several bits and represents specific physical meanings such as macroblock type and quantization parameters. Syntax defines the structure of syntax elements, while semantics illustrate the specific meaning of semantic elements. All video encoder standards establish the workflow of the encoder/decoder by defining syntax and semantics.

Utilizing the temporal domain's relevance involves encoding the differences in coding time for continuous image blocks. Motion estimation and motion compensation are commonly employed to take advantage of the temporal domain's relevance. Motion vectors derived from preceding frames are used to predict the current pixel block in the encoding/decoding process.

The encoding end takes advantage of spatial redundancy of residual error by only encoding the difference between the current block and the corresponding predicted block after motion estimation. The encoding process involves transformation, quantization, scanning output, and entropy encoding.

In addition to the aforementioned techniques, the h.264/AVC standard also includes oversampling relationships, motion vectors, block size partitioning, graded quantization, and various image types. It has introduced a new intra prediction model based on the correlation of adjacent pixels, aiming to improve the compression efficiency.

The quantization step, which is determined by the quantitative parameter (qp), plays a crucial role in the encoding process. By effectively combining transformation and quantization, the h.264/AVC standard has reduced the computational operations required for code compression.

The block structure-based encoding characteristic of h.264/AVC introduces quantization errors at block boundaries, leading to block effects that impact the image quality. To address this issue, a deblocking filter based on content is introduced to eliminate the block effect and improve the quality of the decoding image.

The code stream contains sp slice and si slice, enabling quick transfer between code streams with similar content but different code rates, supporting random access and quick playback. Inter macro block refresh and multi-reference macro block permission encoding provide adaptability to different transmission channels and channel code rates.

In wireless communication applications, h.264/AVC supports the adjustment of wireless channel bit rates through changes in quantization precision or space/time resolution of each frame. The standard employs the sp frame of stream switching to replace hierarchical encoding, achieving superior performance compared to preceding video encoding standards.

Overall, the h.264/AVC standard significantly improves system structure and efficiency across various aspects in comparison to preceding video encoding standards. Despite its enhanced performance, the standard incurs higher computational complexity. Therefore, achieving greater encoding efficiency while reducing computational complexity remains an area of priority for future research.
