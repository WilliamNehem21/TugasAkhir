The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 covers related work and provides the theoretical foundation for this research. Section 3 outlines the proposed framework, while Section 4 demonstrates a practical application of the d4i framework through a typical case of spear phishing attack. Section 5 interprets and describes the work, comparing it to existing approaches. Finally, Section 6 summarizes the findings and discusses future work.

The cyber forensic field triage process model (CFFTPM) suggests an approach to quickly identify, analyze, and interpret digital evidence at a crime scene. It focuses on reducing the time needed for on-scene investigations, advocating a series of phases to gather information from a Windows system, including planning, triage, usage/user profiles, chronology/timeline, internet activity, and case-specific evidence. Of relevance to this work are the usage/user profiles, chronology/timeline, and internet activity phases. However, the model lacks clear definitions for artifact categorization and fails to specify how these artifacts can be leveraged in investigations.

The CFFTPM model overlooks how artifact categorization can aid investigations and provides details on what needs to be examined rather than guidance on utilizing these details for investigations.

The C4KC model serves two purposes: actionable intelligence aligned with an adversary's steps and intrusion analysis. However, it assumes that cyber-attack detection is based on an Indicator of Compromise (IOC). It suggests beginning analysis from the phase to which the IOC belongs, assuming prior phases have already been executed. C4KC and IOCs can be used in investigations with prior knowledge of a cyber-attack, although IOCs do not guide investigations but support them.

In the application example of the d4i framework to a spear phishing attack, an email with a malicious document attachment was sent to the victim, a targeted form of phishing email attack according to FireEye. The investigation starts from the installation C4KC phase (d4ichoose), identifying artifacts based on proposed categorization and mapping (d4iidentify). From this, it is determined that a run registry key was created at a specific timestamp, starting a code located in an alternate data stream. Artifacts from subsequent phases are also identified, such as an XLS file and a covert communication channel with an IP address using DNS protocol.

This section demonstrates that the attack was investigated step-by-step using the d4i framework, revealing a phishing email attack with the goal of exfiltrating data by capturing screenshots of the compromised system. The procedure described can be automated through algorithm implementation to aid forensic examiners in finding correlations and visualizing results.
