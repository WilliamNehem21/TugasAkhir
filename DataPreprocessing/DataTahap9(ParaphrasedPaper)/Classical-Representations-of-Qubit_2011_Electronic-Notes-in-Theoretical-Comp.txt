This paper provides a comprehensive solution to a specific question by demonstrating the existence of five distinct classes, which are associated with subgroups of A4, the alternating group on four letters, or subgroups of S3, the symmetric group on three letters. The novelty of this finding is underscored by the unexpected correlation between classical and quantum channels, which challenges the assumption that these channels possess only superficial similarities. Moreover, the paper establishes that the property (ei, b) = 0 for all i implies b = 0, leading to the conclusion that any affine homeomorphism of the unit ball onto itself must preserve the center. Consequently, it is inferred that any qubit channel is unital, and further analysis suggests that the corresponding matrix must belong to SO(3), the special orthogonal group in three dimensions.
