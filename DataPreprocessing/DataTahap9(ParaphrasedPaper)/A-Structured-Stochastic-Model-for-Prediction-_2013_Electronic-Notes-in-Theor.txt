The study introduces an innovative use of stochastic automata networks (SAN) to model a specific geological phenomenon, which is a challenging task due to the complex nature of natural phenomena and the need to consider numerous contributing factors. The selection, discretization, and grouping of key variables are crucial steps in the modeling process due to the large number of natural variables influencing the phenomenon under consideration.

When using SAN as a modeling tool, the initial step involves identifying structures within the process, where each structure is treated as an automaton consisting of states and transitions. Each transition is governed by one or more events, classified as either local or synchronizing. A local event affects only one automaton, triggering a transition without influencing other automata.

The paper also explores a specific coin-tossing game with variations, in which a player guesses the outcome of a coin flip to win or lose.

Furthermore, the study categorizes four types of deposits associated with forced regression (FR), lowstand normal regression (LNR), highstand normal regression (HNR), and transgression (T), each influenced by the relative sea level and sediment supply rate. The modeling focuses on the Pelotas Basin, considering the absence of uplift and downward crustal movement.

The research involved tests to determine the rate of up and down events, with the observed rate aligning closely with the expected results from Contreras et al. Transitions cease when all automata reach a specific state, and the event "rst" synchronizes transitions between all the automata, resetting the model to its initial state.

Overall, the paper presents a unique approach to modeling specific geological phenomena, aiming to predict generic types of stratal stacking patterns for the Pelotas Basin. The main objective is to demonstrate a potentially valuable and previously unknown predictive tool for estimating statistics related to natural phenomena.

The authors highlight the value of their research, not only for the subject matter but also for the interdisciplinary challenges it poses, requiring effective communication among collaborators. The logical next step in their research is to refine the model by incorporating data from alternative literature and building upon the knowledge gained from this initial work.
