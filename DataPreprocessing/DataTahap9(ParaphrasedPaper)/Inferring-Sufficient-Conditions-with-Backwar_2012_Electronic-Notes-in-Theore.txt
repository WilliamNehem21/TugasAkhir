This paper focuses on the automatic deduction of adequate pre-conditions through abstract interpretation and outlines the development of an under-approximating backward analysis. The primary emphasis is on numeric domains, and the paper suggests transfer functions, including a lower widening, for polyhedra, without needing disjunctive completion or complementation, while still effectively managing non-determinism. The applications include establishing adequate conditions for a program to remain within a safe state envelope or to inevitably fail. The construction is in its initial stages and has not been significantly tested, but the paper advocates for the consideration of this area of research.

Section 2 introduces adequate conditions at the transition systems level. Section 3 discusses the algebraic properties of backward functions, which are utilized in section 4 to devise under-approximated operators for polyhedra. Section 5 examines related prior work, and section 6 offers concluding remarks.

The paper acknowledges that generator representations are not unique and that the output depends on the choice of representation. It also addresses the issue of the standard widening and proposes a similar solution. The paper suggests an approach to refine the lower widening in a traditional manner.

The study observes that weakest (liberal) preconditions, introduced by Dijkstra, have been extensively explored using various inference and validation methods, such as interactive theorem proving and automatic finite-state computations. These methods are exact, possibly concerning an abstract model that over-approximates the concrete system, making it such that adequate conditions on the model do not always apply to the original system. Fully automatic methods based on underapproximations are less common.

In conclusion, the paper has discussed the deduction of adequate conditions through abstract interpretation and has presented general characteristics of backward underapproximated semantics, along with proposing sample transfer functions in the polyhedra domain. The study highlights the need for further work, including the development of new underapproximated operators, particularly tests and lower widenings, contemplating new domains, and conducting experiments on practical programs. The construction and findings are preliminary and mostly untested, and the intent is to persuade the reader that this area constitutes a promising avenue of research.
