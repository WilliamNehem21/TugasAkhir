Transforming them to p', until p becomes empty, and all that's left is p' and q. As p is empty, our invariant indicates that no variables are left, so both p' and q are closed and can be directly checked. The only possible issue is the recursive invocation of the typechecker on q. However, upon examination, the algorithm only places strictly smaller type-checking tasks into q.
