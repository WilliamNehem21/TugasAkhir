This academic paper suggests that using actionscript can help students not only complete programming tasks, but also identify and correct errors in smaller tasks more easily. Actionscript is recommended as a beneficial step up to high-level languages like C++ and is perceived to be easier to learn due to its immediate visualization capabilities. The paper also highlights the widespread use of actionscript in the real world, as argued by citeleed:2007:gamesfirst.

The paper outlines a work in progress involving animation and interactive programming aimed at engaging first-year university students with diverse educational backgrounds and subject disciplines in programming principles. The focus is on guiding students through progressive programming tasks, starting from simple commands and assignments and culminating in game design, particularly the development of a breakout computer game. The research aimed to assess and describe the effectiveness of this approach in engaging students and fostering their understanding of programming and scripting concepts.

Actionscript, according to the paper, employs traditional coding techniques while allowing users to visually understand the effects of their code on program execution. It also includes a syntax checker to help users identify errors, which contrasts with languages like JavaScript where errors may not be easily identifiable. The paper also emphasizes that actionscript allows specific code actions to be executed even if the overall program is unfinished, which is not possible in JavaScript.

Additionally, the paper highlights the utility of actionscript for starting with simple tasks, such as utilizing increment and decrement operators to move objects in a two-dimensional or three-dimensional space. The research was conducted with a first-year course in information and communications technology, taking into account the diverse backgrounds and experiences of the students. Through a quantitative and qualitative evaluation, it was found that actionscript was effective in helping students engage with programming and scripting principles, particularly for those with no prior experience in these areas. The study also found a significant improvement in students' understanding and performance over time as a result of using actionscript.
