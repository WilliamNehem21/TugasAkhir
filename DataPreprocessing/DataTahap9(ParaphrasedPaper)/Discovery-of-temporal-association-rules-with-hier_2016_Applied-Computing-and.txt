The paper is organized as follows: related works are discussed in section 2, the problem statement is provided in section 3, the proposed algorithm considering the first transaction appearance period is presented in section 4, the performance of the proposed approach is evaluated in section 5, and conclusions as well as future research directions are given in section 6.

Chang et al. examined the temporal mining problem of products on display in a store and introduced the concept of common exhibition to identify patterns. Lee et al. extended this concept to discover general temporal association rules for publication databases, while Ale and Rossi focused on transaction periods to find temporal association rules, considering that different products may have varying on-shelf properties due to factors such as popularity and supply dynamics. The authors then introduced the concept of a hierarchy of time granules and presented an effective approach (abbreviated as TPPF) for mining hierarchical temporal association rules in temporal databases, incorporating a strategy to predict the upper-bound of support values for itemsets. Experimentation showed that TPPF outperformed the existing TP-HTAR approach in reducing database scan and computational time.

Future research directions include investigating the incremental problem of hierarchical temporal association rule mining, approximating the optimal minimum support and confidence using machine learning techniques, and exploring more efficient mining algorithms such as FP-growth to accelerate the mining process. Additionally, the authors intend to study utility mining to expand the application of hierarchical temporal association rule mining.
