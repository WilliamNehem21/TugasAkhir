The formalisms of modal and mixed transition systems enable the combination of over- and under-approximation in a single specification. We establish the EXPTIME-completeness of three key decision problems for such specifications. These problems involve determining whether a set of modal or mixed specifications has a common implementation, whether a sole mixed specification has an implementation, and whether all implementations of one mixed specification are implementations of another mixed or modal one. Our results are derived through a sequence of reductions commencing with the acceptance problem for linearly bounded alternating Turing machines.

We also explore the concept of consistency in a single behavioral model. In the context of models serving as specifications, inconsistency implies that the specification cannot be implemented. Conversely, a consistent model enhances confidence in implementability and may even facilitate code generation for such an implementation.

This paper proceeds by providing background information on alternating Turing machines, specifications, and their decision problems in Section 2. Section 3 presents state-of-the-art bounds for these problems, while Section 4 introduces the newly established EXPTIME-completeness results. In Section 5, we reflect on an existing open complexity gap for a specific type of mixed specifications, namely modal ones. We conclude with a summary in Section 6.

For a comprehensive review of related work, readers are directed to our recent overview. This paper primarily presents improvements on the results discussed in detail in Section 3. Additionally, the relationship between this work and generalized model checking is examined in Section 5.

We provide a superpolynomial algorithm, which establishes a common implementation for k> 1 modal specifications. The algorithm exhibits exponential complexity in k, but becomes polynomial when k is fixed. It determines a common implementation if one exists. These upper bounds are also derived from the polynomial algorithm for consistency checking of a conjunction of disjunctive modal transition systems, as investigated in prior work.

Specifications mi, mhead, mctrl, and mexist represent tape cell i, the current head position, the finite control of t, and acceptance (respectively). Common implementations of these specifications capture action synchronization to ensure agreement on various aspects, such as the symbol read from the tape, the head position, the symbol written to the tape, the direction of head movement, the transitions taken by the finite control, and the determination of computation acceptance. The cumulative effect is that a common refinement of these specifications corresponds to an accepting computation of t on input w. More precisely, any common implementations will correspond to different unfoldings of the structure of the finite control into a computation tree based on the content of the tape cells and the tape head position.

Theorem 4.1 establishes the EXPTIME-hardness of ci for modal specifications. Building on this, we conclude that the upper bound derived in previous work is tight: ci is EXPTIME-complete. Furthermore, by applying the reduction of ci for modal specifications to c for mixed specifications, we assert that c for mixed specifications is also EXPTIME-complete. Additionally, by appealing to the reduction of c for mixed specifications to tr for mixed specifications, we demonstrate that tr for mixed specifications is also EXPTIME-complete.
