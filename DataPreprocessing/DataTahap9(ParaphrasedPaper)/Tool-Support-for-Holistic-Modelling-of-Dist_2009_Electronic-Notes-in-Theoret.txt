This academic paper advocates for a comprehensive approach to modeling embedded systems, emphasizing the interrelatedness of various system aspects and the use of formal methods. It suggests the use of the Creol language for object-oriented modeling of distributed systems, and discusses ongoing efforts in designing and implementing tools to support modeling, validation, and verification of sensor networks. It highlights the challenges arising from resource constraints in embedded systems and proposes integrating various properties into the model using high-level abstractions. The paper also addresses the complexities of multi-threaded programs, asynchronous message passing, and the structuring mechanisms in Creol.

Furthermore, the paper discusses the development of a compiler to support Creol models, utilizing formal semantics and static checks, as well as the use of the Maude interpreter for simulation and analysis. It also examines the application of data flow analysis and model checking techniques to detect errors and optimize resource management in distributed systems. The paper further explores the use of abstractions and optimization techniques to reduce the state space of systems for verification purposes.

The authors also discuss the limitations of synchronous method calls and the need for techniques such as partial order reduction to handle nondeterminism and provide more efficient model checking. The paper concludes by highlighting the need for further research on compositional methods for reasoning about global behavior in embedded systems.

The work presented in this paper is part of the Credo project and aims to bridge the gap between formal modeling and practical implementation in real devices, particularly those with limited memory. The paper underscores the potential of using formal methods to develop reliable embedded systems and highlights the challenges and opportunities in this domain.
