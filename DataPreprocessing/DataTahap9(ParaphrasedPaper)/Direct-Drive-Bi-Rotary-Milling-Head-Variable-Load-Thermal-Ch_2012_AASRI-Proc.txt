This academic paper explores the impact of thermal properties on the accuracy of machine tools during the machining process using a bi-rotary milling head that applies direct cutting force. The study conducts an analysis of the thermal properties under varying processing conditions, using a direct drive type double pendulum angle milling head. A CAD model of the bi-rotary milling head is created on the SolidWorks platform and imported into the ANSYS platform for further analysis. The study involves determining the heat source, convection boundary conditions, and constraints of the bi-rotary milling head structure, and simulating the temperature field model and digital simulation under different load processing conditions. The thermal characteristic analysis of the A and C axis load-temperature-time distribution is conducted to provide insights for the design of high-grade CNC machine straight drive processing technology.

The bi-rotary milling head is highlighted as a crucial component of the CNC milling machine, with its structure and performance significantly impacting the overall machine performance and market competition. The paper categorizes the double pendulum angle milling head into mechanical milling head and direct drive torque motor milling head, with the direct drive milling head emerging as a promising alternative due to its advantages such as compact size, improved machining accuracy, reduced vibration and friction, and enhanced system accuracy. The study also introduces the use of gimbals and electric spindle torque motor direct drive to achieve C-axis rotation and axis A swing, with two pairs of torque motors installed in parallel.
