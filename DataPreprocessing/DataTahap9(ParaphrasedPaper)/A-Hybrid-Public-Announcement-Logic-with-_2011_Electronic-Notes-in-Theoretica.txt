This paper presents a synthesis of hybrid logic machinery and public announcement logic, achieved by adapting the underlying hybrid logic to accommodate partial denotation of states by nominals. It introduces an axiom system for the resulting hybrid public announcement logic and proves general completeness using reduction axioms. The paper also demonstrates that distributed knowledge can be defined using satisfaction operators and the downarrow binder.

While hybrid logic was originally introduced in the context of temporal logics, it is shown that it can be extended to other modal logics such as epistemic logic. The paper addresses the dearth of research on combining dynamic epistemic logic with hybrid logic by internalizing all epistemic actions of a full dynamic epistemic logic (DEL) and combining PAL with hybrid logic.

The study also examines the advantages of integrating hybrid machinery into PAL, emphasizing the improved proof theory of hybrid PAL compared to its classical counterpart. The paper outlines the structure, including the introduction of hybrid logic with partially denoting nominals, the presentation of a hybrid version of PAL and a discussion on adding distributed knowledge to the logic.

The paper demonstrates that nominals, satisfaction operators, the downarrow binder, the global modality, and distributed knowledge can be incorporated into public announcement logic. It illustrates that general completeness results for extensions with pure formulas also transfer to hybrid public announcement logic, confirming that the public announcement operator does not increase the expressive power when added to hybrid logic. The study also suggests avenues for future research, such as adding common knowledge to hybrid public announcement logic and extending the logic to full dynamic epistemic logic.
