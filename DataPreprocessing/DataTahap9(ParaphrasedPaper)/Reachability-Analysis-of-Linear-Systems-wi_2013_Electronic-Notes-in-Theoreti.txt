The issue of determining the reachability of an autonomous system, a system lacking an input, can be addressed by incorporating the input into the state space while assuming that the inputs are characterized by stepwise constancy. This adjustment results in an increase in the number of dimensions by the number of inputs, as a trade-off for the absence of inputs in the system.

It should be noted that when the system is non-invertible, a preliminary system transformation is required before implementing the conventional approach. However, this preparatory step is unnecessary when utilizing the proposed alternative approach. Furthermore, a more thorough examination reveals that the computational complexity of both approaches is essentially equivalent.
