As stated earlier, we have discussed related studies previously. The structure of the paper is as follows: following the introductory sections, Section 3 presents the findings on HTL with a minimum of two variables, while Section 4 outlines the results on HTL1. The conclusion can be found in Section 5. Due to space constraints, we have not provided complete proofs for all aspects. Specifically, some correctness proofs for translated formulas are omitted. Nevertheless, we have made an effort to develop the translated formulas in such a way that their correctness can be easily verified by the reader.
