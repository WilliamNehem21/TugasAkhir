The use of digital twins (DTs) in the manufacturing industry is gaining prominence due to their capability to optimize processes and products through high-fidelity forecasting. DTs are virtual representations of various systems within manufacturing, such as machinery, production lines, and products, and can be utilized at any stage of the manufacturing process, not just limited to pre-production planning and design but also for maintenance, market analysis, and other aspects.

A key aspect of creating digital twins efficiently lies in reusing existing artifacts such as data, models, and algorithms. The Digitbrain platform enables this through decomposing DTs into their constituting parts and storing their metadata in a registry, facilitating the easy creation of DTs through composition of data-model-algorithm tuples.

In addition, the platform supports the reuse of machine learning models and their individual training with customized datasets, providing a fast and reproducible way to implement artificial intelligence in production. A simulation engine called DDDSimulator is utilized for systems-of-systems (SoS) analysis, allowing for the assessment of alternative layouts and performance simulations of different production plans.

The paper emphasizes the importance of metadata descriptions in enabling model reuse, and the use of an asset metadata registry to facilitate this. The authors also discuss the use of machine learning frameworks, model portability standards, and the integration of 3D and discrete event simulation (DES) models within the Digitbrain platform.

The research and development team involved in this paper comes from various academic and industrial backgrounds, with expertise in fields such as physics, artificial intelligence, materials engineering, and simulation. Their collective contributions have led to the development of the Digitbrain platform and its capabilities in supporting digital twins and advanced manufacturing processes.
