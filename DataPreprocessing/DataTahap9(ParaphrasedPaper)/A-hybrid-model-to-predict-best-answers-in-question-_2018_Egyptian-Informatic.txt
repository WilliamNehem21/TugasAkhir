The use of question answering communities (QAC) is increasingly widespread due to the ample information and resources they offer, aimed at facilitating knowledge sharing and exchange among users across various categories. However, challenges exist in the knowledge process, such as the difficulty for askers to determine the best answer for their questions, particularly with subjective matters. This paper presents an analysis conducted on the Stack Overflow community and proposes a hybrid model for predicting the best answer. The model comprises two modules: one focused on content features and the other on non-content features, including a novel reputation score function. The study demonstrates promising prediction accuracy through experiments involving the training of three different classifiers using the newly added features.

In QAC, users can upvote or downvote questions and answers, and the reputation points score is influenced by factors such as upvotes, receiving a bounty, or being selected as the best answer. Other user activities, such as commenting on posts and marking them as favorite, depend on the user's privilege within the community, determined by their reputation score. The paper aims to address the challenge of knowledge exchange by predicting the best answer, recognizing this as a key issue in question answering portals.

To improve QAC mechanisms, the paper emphasizes the importance of enhancing question-answer routing approaches and best answer techniques. Previous research in this area has focused on recommending experts for specific questions, predicting the best answer, identifying collaborative expert groups, and directing questions to experts, all with the goal of improving user satisfaction rates and minimizing time loss while waiting for the right expert to respond.

The paper provides an overview of related work in knowledge exchange approaches, including studies that aim to find experts using user reputation, authority, and subject relevance, predict the best answer in massive open online courses, identify factors influencing the selection of the best answer, and propose question-answering models for collaborative learning. Key findings from these studies are outlined, and the proposed hybrid model in the present paper is positioned as an advancement in predicting the best answer, particularly in comparison to a previous study conducted on the Yahoo! Answers platform.

The hybrid model in the paper comprises two modules: one for predicting the best answers using content features and another for predicting the best answer using non-content features. These two modules are combined to form a hybrid model, with the aim of achieving the best prediction result. The study evaluates the performance of the proposed model using precision, recall, and accuracy metrics and compares the results with those obtained from training classifiers using only content features.

The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid model and the inclusion of non-content features do not significantly improve accuracy compared to using only content features. Additionally, reputation scores from the Stack Overflow community and the novel reputation model yield similar prediction accuracy. The paper highlights that the highest accuracy is achieved when training the classifier using only content features.

The analysis also includes a comparison of the accuracy results between the two proposed hybrid models and provides insights into the behavior of the classifiers across different window sizes. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of the findings and their relevance to improving question answering portals and knowledge exchange in online communities.
