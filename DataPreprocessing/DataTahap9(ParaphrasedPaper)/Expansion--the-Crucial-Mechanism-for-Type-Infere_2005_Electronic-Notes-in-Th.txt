Expansion on typings was first introduced in the late 1970s by Coppo, Dezani, and Venneri to analyze the potential typings of a term when utilizing intersection types. Although previously somewhat enigmatic and unfamiliar, expansion is crucial for carrying out compositional type inference. The main concept behind expansion is to be able to assess the impact of incorporating an intersection introduction typing rule into a typing derivation without having to construct a new derivation. The recent introduction of expansion variables (e-variables) has enhanced the readability and simplicity of these calculations. E-variables enable the deferral of decisions regarding which typing rules to apply until sufficient information is available for making an informed choice during constraint solving. Furthermore, expansion can be extended to type constructors beyond intersection, such as the "!" operator in linear logic, and e-variables facilitate this process.

This paper does not present novel technical findings; rather, it serves as a comprehensive overview and explanation of the technical outcomes from twenty-five years of expansion research. The paper also emphasizes the importance of understanding type inference for the full system, as it is simpler, before attempting to utilize intersection types to their full potential.

The paper also discusses the concept of relevant type environments, which contain only necessary assumptions and comply with the principles of relevant logic. This relevant system further exhibits the characteristic of linear types, as elaborated in section 5.2.

The importance of expansion in the context of an intersection type system is demonstrated in subsection 3.1, followed by an explanation of how expansion was historically designed to work in subsection 3.2. The modern method of expansion using expansion variables is then introduced in subsection 3.3.

Expansion variables serve as placeholders for unknown applications of other typing rules, such as intersection introduction, and are filled using substitution by replacing the e-variable with an expansion term, referred to as an expansion. Substitutions apply to type environments in a pointwise manner.

The paper also presents the relations between expansion and other related concepts, such as function application and unification with e-variables, providing insights into potential future developments in this area. Additionally, the paper acknowledges the contribution of several researchers involved in the development and review of the presented content.
