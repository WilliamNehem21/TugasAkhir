The security of IMS networks is a crucial concern alongside quality of service (QoS) for enabling the development of new services on IMS platforms. This encompasses the security of users, service providers, and operators responsible for the core IMS. Various research efforts have been dedicated to addressing these security issues. To contribute to this field, this paper offers an analysis of notable work in this area and presents an approach to addressing security issues in IMS networks, with a specific focus on users and service providers. Through our analysis, we have identified critical interfaces that require enhanced attention to bolster security in IMS networks.

Due to its reliance on the IP protocol, IMS inherits the security vulnerabilities of IP networks. The open and distributed nature of IMS, along with its flexible implementation and deployment, results in a multitude of communication interfaces that can render the system vulnerable to attacks. Furthermore, to ensure the confidentiality and privacy of users, it is imperative to secure every level of the IMS network architecture, including end-user devices.

In the IMS core, the use of SIP and Diameter protocols introduces security risks, with SIP being susceptible to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Critical attacks against the IMS core can target CSCF components, compromising the control function and potentially leading to the interception or alteration of sensitive messages.

Recognizing the significance of network security in general, various organizations and research initiatives, such as 3GPP, ITU, and ETSI, have put forth recommendations to secure IMS networks. We present the recommendations of these organizations in this paper.

The TVRA method views a system as a collection of physical and logical properties, each of which may possess weaknesses that could be exploited by threats, potentially resulting in security incidents that breach the system's security objectives. Vulnerabilities, defined as combinations of weaknesses exploitable by one or more threats, are addressed through countermeasures aimed at protecting the system and mitigating risks.

The IMS client, representing any user accessing services on the IMS network, may connect via a telecommunication network with a SIM card for authentication or an IP network without a SIM card.

The C-S interface facilitates the exchange of media content between the client and service platforms, utilizing protocols such as HTTP and RTP depending on the specific service.

Our analysis of IMS network security highlights three critical interfacesâ€”namely I-C, I-S, and C-S. Traffic across these interfaces traverses public networks, making them particularly vulnerable to attacks when compared to interfaces within the IMS core network. We place less emphasis on interfaces and components within the IMS core network due to their inherent protection from external access and the relatively lower probability of attacks compared to the external interfaces under consideration.

Confidentiality across all interfaces is paramount, necessitating that the content offered on service platforms should only be accessible to permitted clients and that media traffic must remain confidential if the communicating parties opt for this feature.
