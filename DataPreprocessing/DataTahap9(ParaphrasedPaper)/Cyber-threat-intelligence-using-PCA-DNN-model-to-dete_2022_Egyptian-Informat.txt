The primary challenge confronting the field of computer science at this time revolves around safeguarding and preserving data from potential risks, as well as shielding it and legitimate users from malicious attacks. While robust defense mechanisms, such as multifactor authentication and secure system construction, can provide protection, they are unable to detect whether a company is currently experiencing a zero-day attack. In addition to prevention of attacks, systems must also gather and safeguard data as evidence, while employing existing solutions like firewalls, encryption, and intrusion detection systems. However, there are two fundamental issues with these existing solutions.

Jalil et al. compared the effectiveness of various AI approaches (e.g., neural networks, SVM, and DT-J48 algorithms) based on different metrics (detection rate, false alarm rate, and accuracy) using the well-known KDD-Cup dataset. Their experiments concluded that the DT-J48 algorithm outperformed neural networks and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms. 

Hamid et al. examined several approaches (rule-based, base rule, functions, lazy learners, tree, meta-algorithm, and input-mapped classifier) using WEKA tools and the KDD Cup 1999 dataset. The comparative analysis was based on several metrics (accuracy, recall, precision, F-measure, TP rate, TN rate, ROC area, kappa statistic, and mean absolute error). The authors utilized this approach with and without feature reduction, demonstrating that classification methods do not necessarily require all features. However, a key limitation of this research is the limited amount of data.

Haripriya and Jabbar analyzed various machine learning algorithms (supervised and unsupervised, reinforcement learning, etc.) using methods, datasets, and metrics to compare machine learning approaches, but they did not explore other approaches, such as fuzzy logic, ant colony optimization, and deep learning. Another limitation was the lack of information regarding the number of features inputted into the model, and whether the data was continuous or categorical. Additionally, the optimization phase lacked details on parameters such as the optimization function, and the preprocessing was conducted using a black box approach. The authors also did not specify whether the data was normalized, how they handled missing and categorical values, or whether the data was balanced. Furthermore, the model suffered from overfitting.

This paper introduces a hybrid method for evaluating network behavior in the intrusion detection process, leveraging supervised techniques (DNN), unfiltered measurements (PCA), and statistical measures to enhance the accuracy of detecting stealth attacks. The Canadian Institute of Cyber Security (CIC) provided the CSE-CICIDS2018 dataset, which has been underutilized by researchers up to the time of writing. This dataset is utilized at the flow level, capturing statistical measurements of flow-level features. The proposed method offers a fundamental solution to the issue of volumetric attack mitigation in the context of attacks such as DDoS, HTTP, and floods.

Despite the availability of various standard datasets, many of them encompass offensive, non-modifiable, outdated, and non-reproducible attack scenarios. To address these limitations and introduce more contemporary traffic patterns, the CSE-CI-UNB dataset was developed. The accurately labeled CSE-CI-IDS 2018 dataset reflects real network behavior and encompasses a variety of intrusion scenarios. it includes the full network set including all internal paths to evaluate the loads for pre-packet inspection.

The adapted dataset comprises ten days of normal and malicious network activity and was derived from two files containing abstract images of events and activities in the network. These profiles can provide real data for protocols such as FTP, POP3, IMAP, SMTP, SSH, and HTTP. In addition, agents or individual users can use these profiles to introduce different scenarios into the network. Personal files are also exchanged with real school datasets to stimulate network activity for premium applications.

In this attack scenario, a large number of infected devices known as zombies are interconnected under a command and control (CC) empire. These hosts are typically infected by malware, and when the command and control issues an order, the entire army participates in the attack. Typically, these bots are utilized in DDoS attacks, cryptocurrency mining, and distributed processing.

The network testbed architecture consists of 500 machines divided into five separate LANs, simulating a realistic network topology for various organizational departments. However, there are limitations to this dataset, including a large amount of anonymous IP packets generated by data management and network monitoring operations, and flow records containing infinity and NaN values.

This section outlines the methodology of the proposed model architecture, presenting a hybrid system that analyzes flow-level traffic and captures attacks, utilizing supervised techniques (DNN) and unfiltered measurements (PCA) to improve accuracy. The research also outlines the differences in class and network flow features between the CIC IDS 2018 dataset and the ISCX IDS 2012 and CIC IDS 2017 datasets.

The data preprocessing phase involves cleaning, conversion, and preparation of the data for input into the deep learning algorithm to ensure accuracy and effectiveness of the model. The deep neural network (DNN) and principal component analysis (PCA) are utilized to analyze the CICIDS 2018 dataset. 

Overall, this paper discusses the importance of safeguarding data and systems, evaluating different approaches for intrusion detection, and highlights the significance of utilizing advanced techniques such as DNN and PCA for anomaly detection in network security.
