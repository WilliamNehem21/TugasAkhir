This paper introduces a definition of weak bisimulation for action-type systems, which encompasses familiar labelled transition systems and various types of probabilistic systems. The authors emphasize the role of actions in viewing coalgebras as a result of bifunctors over the category set.

In the realm of concrete probabilistic transition systems, several proposals have been made for weak bisimulation, tailored to specific models. Segala proposed four weak relation notions for simple probabilistic automata, while Baier and Hermanns presented an appealing definition for generative probabilistic systems. Weak bisimulation has also been studied in the context of the alternating model and extended to infinite systems. Desharnais et al. provided a metric analogue of weak bisimulation.

The notion of bisimilarity for labelled transition systems (LTSs) and generative systems, along with their coalgebraic definitions, align. This paper presents a general method for deriving such coincidence results, applicable to both LTSs and generative systems. Additionally, the paper utilizes this method to establish a concrete characterization of bisimilarity for a functor discussed in Section 5, as described in Lemma 2.12.

The paper also addresses weak preservation of pullbacks and specifically focuses on weak pullback preservation for the functor ga. This preservation was previously proven for generative systems with finite support, using various techniques, and is extended here to arbitrary, infinite matrices.

The general definition of weak bisimulation for action-type systems presented in this paper is inspired by existing definitions for concrete systems. The authors suggest that a weak bisimulation for a given system emerges as a strong bisimulation for a modified system derived from the original one.

The paper proposes a coalgebraic definition of weak bisimulation for action-type systems, justifying it by considering labelled transition systems and generative probabilistic systems and demonstrating its alignment with concrete definitions. Additionally, the paper includes other contributions, such as handling probabilistic distributions without restricting the support set's cardinality, and providing definitions for systems of arbitrary size.
