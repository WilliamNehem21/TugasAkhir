In this academic paper, the authors present a conceptual examination of joints, marginals, and independence within the context of categorical probability. They establish this by equipping conventional probability monads, such as the Giry monad, with both a monoidal and an opmonoidal structure that are mutually compatible, known as a bimonoidal structure.

The paper outlines the theory and operational interpretation of this concept, utilizing graphical calculus for monoidal categories. The authors introduce a definition of stochastic independence based on the bimonoidal structure, which aligns with intuition and other existing approaches in the literature for cartesian monoidal categories. Additionally, they demonstrate that the Kantorovich monad on the category of complete metric spaces is a bimonoidal monad for a non-cartesian monoidal structure.

However, the authors note that not all probability monads documented in the literature are bimonoidal, and some are not even strong. They highlight a well-known example of this discrepancy. While non-bimonoidal probability monads may have utility in measure theory to describe spaces of measures, they are not suitable for applications in probability, as they do not accommodate the discussion of critical concepts such as stochastic independence and correlation, which are integral to probability theory. The authors thus argue that for a monad to be considered a genuine probability monad, it should be a bimonoidal monad.

The Kantorovich monad is presented as an example of a probability monad on complete metric spaces, initially defined by Van Breugel for compact and complete 1-bounded metric spaces. The paper draws on the definitions and results provided by a reference to apply to all complete metric spaces.
