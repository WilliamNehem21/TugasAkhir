The use of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) and vehicle-to-house (V2H) systems provides a reciprocal benefit to both power grid operators and electric vehicle (EV) owners. Grid operators can make use of surplus electric power from EVs, while EV owners can utilize their vehicle batteries as a source of household power. By discharging EV batteries during periods of high power demand, it becomes highly effective in reducing the need for power supply from the grid. The widespread adoption of EVs and their simultaneous connection to the grid may require grid operators to invest in additional power plants to meet peak power demands. As a result, research has focused on developing charge/discharge control schemes for EVs to meet their power requirements and to supply power back to the grid during periods of high demand. Additionally, real-time pricing (RTP) mechanisms, where electric power prices fluctuate based on the level of power demand, have been examined as a means of reducing peak energy demand. Consequently, EV owners stand to benefit by selling electric power from their vehicles at higher prices during times of peak electricity demand. Aggressive discharge of power from EVs into the grid is anticipated to result in reduced energy costs for households.
