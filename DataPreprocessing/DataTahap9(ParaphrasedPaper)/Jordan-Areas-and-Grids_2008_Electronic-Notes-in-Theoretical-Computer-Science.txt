Many of the definitions in this paper simultaneously pertain to both a set S and its closure S. Therefore, the focus will be on compact sets (i.e., sets that are both bounded and closed). Of particular interest is the use of grids of points with decreasing Hausdorff distance to the represented set as a form of representation.

Berg et al. examine a constructive version of the plain Jordan curve theorem, which is not sufficient for our purposes. They demonstrate that a point x outside of the curve and another point y inside the curve can be constructed from the curve. Additionally, for every point z not on the curve, there exists a polygonal path not touching the curve that either connects x and z or y and z.

The first two representations are directly derived from the definition of Jordan domains in prior works. The third representation is essentially a constrained version of a representation of compact sets using a grid of points, as detailed in a previous study. Some properties of this approach, particularly those relating to computational complexity, can be found in our own paper. A comparison of several representations of compact sets can also be found in this paper.
