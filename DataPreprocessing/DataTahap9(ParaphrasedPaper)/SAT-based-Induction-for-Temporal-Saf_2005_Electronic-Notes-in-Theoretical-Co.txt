This paper focuses on addressing the difficulty of fully verifying complex temporal properties in large RTL designs. It discusses the use of windowed induction, proposed by Sheeran, Singh, and St√•lmarck, as an augmentation to bounded model checking for unbounded verification of safety properties. While the induction method has been effective for combinational properties, it has not been suitable for handling temporal properties with previously known methods. The paper introduces explicit induction, a new induction scheme targeted specifically at temporal properties and interactive development of inductive proofs.

One of the key innovations in explicit induction is making the induction scheme an explicit part of the specification, allowing for easy control using a highly expressive language such as ForSpec. The paper describes the implementation of explicit induction with minor modifications in the ForSpec compiler and in Thunder, a bounded model checker. It also demonstrates theoretical completeness by using the property q to describe the set of reachable states of m. The paper also discusses the limitations of windowed induction in handling large models and proposes strategies for overcoming these limitations.

Furthermore, the paper examines the necessary tool support for implementing induction checks, such as checking assertions and induction hypotheses. It advocates for user-guided development of inductive proofs, emphasizing the need for user guidance in finding the correct induction invariants for proofs of the complexity encountered in this work.

The work described in the paper is based on a large model containing approximately 12,000 state elements, which is beyond the capacity of traditional BDD-based model checkers. The paper also provides insights into the practical challenges and strategies involved in developing inductive proofs for verifying temporal properties in large RTL designs.

In conclusion, the paper presents a methodology and tool support for addressing the challenge of fully verifying complex temporal properties on large RTL designs through interactive development of inductive proofs. It emphasizes the importance of user guidance in finding the correct induction invariants, especially for proofs of significant complexity.
