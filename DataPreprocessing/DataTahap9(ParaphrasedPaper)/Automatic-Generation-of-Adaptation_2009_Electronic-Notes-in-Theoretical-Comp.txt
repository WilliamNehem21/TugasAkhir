This academic paper addresses the challenges associated with adapting components and services with discrepancies at both the signature and behavior levels. While interface description languages (such as CORBA and WSDL for components and services, respectively) facilitate the integration of software developed in different languages, they do not effectively handle behavioral incompatibilities. The paper proposes a formal methodology for automatically deriving adapters from service interfaces, including behavioral descriptions, based on an abstract adaptation contract. However, the lack of guidance on constructing this contract, along with the assumption that it is manually created, introduces potential errors and necessitates a comprehensive understanding of all service details by the designer. In response to this, the paper introduces an approach to address this challenge.

The paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 introduces a subset of abstract BPEL used to describe service interfaces. In Section 3, a simplified example of a file exchange system is presented as a case study to illustrate the contract generation process. Section 4 outlines the notation for abstract contracts and the concepts and ideas applied in the proposal. In Section 5, the different components of the proposed approach and further process details are explored. Section 6 references related work, and finally, Section 7 presents future extensions and conclusions.

The proposed approach utilizes a subset of abstract BPEL as the language for representing service behaviors, which contains sufficient information to extract a behavioral interface that can be represented by finite state machines (FSMs). The paper also introduces a formal notation for describing correspondences between transitions of two processes being adapted. The notation is used to represent the abstract adaptation contract by defining mappings between the operations of two services.

Additionally, the paper discusses the implementation of the proposal in a tool called Dinapter, which takes as input the behaviors of the services described using abstract BPEL and outputs a set of adaptation contracts. The significance of the A* algorithm and its underlying heuristic function are also highlighted, emphasizing their role in improving tool efficiency.

Furthermore, the paper compares its approach with related works in the field of web service adaptation. It outlines how other methodologies have addressed behavioral mismatches between BPEL processes, service adaptation for new versions of existing web services, and the use of schema matching tools. The paper also discusses the future work and possible extensions of the proposed approach, emphasizing the potential to include semantic and syntactic information in the adaptation process.

In summary, the paper presents a formal methodology for addressing signature and behavioral inconsistencies in service adaptation, introduces an approach for automatic contract generation, and discusses the potential for extending the approach to include semantic and syntactic information in adaptation processes.
