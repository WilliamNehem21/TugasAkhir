The protein denaturation methods previously employed have been adapted slightly [21,22]. In brief, 0.1 ml of albumin obtained from fresh chicken eggs was combined with 1.9 ml of phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 6.4) and 1 ml of varying concentrations of the aqueous extract, resulting in final concentrations of 31.25, 62.5, 125, 250, and...

Since the concept of tumor angiogenesis was first proposed by Folkman, inhibiting tumor-induced angiogenesis has been viewed as an appealing anticancer strategy due to the potential use of anti-angiogenic agents across various cancer types. The aqueous extract also exhibited potent antiangiogenic activity through the inhibition of blood vessel formation on the chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM). The inhibition demonstrated a dose-dependent pattern. No deceased embryos were observed within the tested dose range, suggesting that the antiangiogenic effect observed was not a result of plant toxicity. This extract displayed stronger anti-angiogenic activity compared to the aqueous extracts of Oncoba welwitschii and Tetrorchidium oppositifolium, which exhibited 83.334% inhibition at 500 Âµg/ml. The CAM, an extraembryonic membrane responsible for gas and nutrient exchange, is widely utilized in researching glioma angiogenesis, growth, invasiveness, and screening of antitumor drugs due to its high vascularity and ease of use. Therefore, based on the findings, the aqueous extract of Lophira procera may possess significant inhibitory activity against tumor growth by blocking angiogenesis. Thus, the use of Lophira procera in traditional medicine for treating breast cancer may be justified.

These biological activities are attributed to the various chemical groups present in this plant, primarily the high concentration of phenolic compounds. Therefore, the utilization of this plant in traditional medicine for its anti-ulcer, anti-breast cancer, and anti-pain properties is validated. The isolation of the phenolic compounds responsible for these activities will be the focus of our forthcoming study.
