The research paper discusses modeling algorithms for scale-free or small-world networks, with modifications to nodes representing the system components' metabolism and changes to edges representing the system structure's metabolism. These modifications impact the network structure and entropy. The study analyzes the ws model based on network entropy and offers conclusions on the u-shaped change in network entropy of the ws network. It also examines the effects of the parameters p and k on the entropy's graphical pattern.

The current focus of complex network studies revolves around three main areas: network model evolution, complex network stability, and complex network dynamics. The paper highlights the most active research area, the evolution model of complex networks, and its focus on network formation mechanisms, generation mechanisms and models of various types of networks, and the formation mechanisms of specific networks in real life. Despite the richness of results in this area, several issues and challenges persist, prompting the need for further exploration and research.

The paper primarily delves into exploring the formation mechanism of ws small-world networks and provides insights that could aid in addressing complex network modeling issues. It suggests that the methods and conclusions presented could be beneficial for researchers and proposes a fresh perspective for developing new complex network models.

From a network perspective, the system's generation and evolution can be categorized into node changes and connection changes, representing the metabolism of system components and structure, respectively. The paper draws attention to the importance of understanding how entropy changes in the system's metabolic processes to allow for effective system control through the design of realistic network models using the ws, nw, ba models or other models.

To analyze the ws model, the paper introduces algorithm 1, which records the network entropy changes during the network evolution process. The trend of the network entropy reflects the ws model's entropy changes during its generation process, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of the model's characteristics and potential for improvement or new model proposals.

Based on experiment results, the paper concludes that the p-value affects the flatness of entropy, with larger p-values resulting in steeper network entropy graphs, while k-values affect the timing of entropy transition. The study also indicates that the network entropy trend for the ws model exhibits a u-shape and suggests further research on the network entropy trend for scale-free networks and the development of new small-world network modeling algorithms from the perspective of network entropy.
