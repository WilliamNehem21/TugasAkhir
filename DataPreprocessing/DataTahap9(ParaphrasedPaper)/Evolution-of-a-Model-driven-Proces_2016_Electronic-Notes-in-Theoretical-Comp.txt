This paper examines the advancements made in the praxis process over the past fifteen years, primarily driven by feedback from both educational and professional projects such as course and synergia projects. The paper outlines the changes that have been implemented, and details the goals and classifications of process and modeling improvements. It presents the evolution of the model-driven development process, discussing the enhancements made in each version and their origins in feedback. Additionally, the paper discusses artifacts reorganization in the context of structural changes in the set of process artifacts, particularly within a model-driven framework.

The second version of praxis, released in 2003 alongside the second edition of the textbook, marked a shift towards a genuinely model-driven approach with improved analysis and design models. The IEEE documents were adapted into model derivatives, reflecting the challenges encountered in using them for small-scale applications. The version also introduced a layered architecture for the logical view in the design model and the application code, incorporating a persistence layer and a system layer to encapsulate environment services. A significant addition was the implementation of a reuse framework for artifacts related to implementation, as well as the adoption of test-driven development using JUnit scripts.

The third edition of the textbook integrated new or upgraded software standards, adopted practices from the extreme programming agile methodology, and embraced UML 2.0 and SPeM, which deeply influenced the modeling approach. Additionally, the use of fully automated functional tests was introduced, and the framework stereotype profile was enhanced to facilitate the extraction of derived artifacts. The current version also provides support for multiple detail collections in the solution model and code.

The author's experience with practice-oriented courses utilizing praxis as the development process for writing course applications has informed the ongoing development of a fourth edition of the Brazilian textbook, which aims to consolidate the advancements made in praxis over the past fifteen years.
