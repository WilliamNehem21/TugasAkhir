Medical CT imaging is a reflection of how much X-rays are absorbed by organs and tissues, offering a valuable method for detecting small lesions and microstructures within the body. It is a crucial tool in medical image diagnosis. However, during the imaging and transfer process, the two-dimensional channel, known as the point spread function, can cause image blurring. This degradation can impact the display and diagnostic accuracy of CT images. The process of CT image degradation is often not well understood. Blind image restoration aims to remove interference and noise in situations where the degradation is unknown, recovering lost image information and striving to approach the original image as closely as possible.
