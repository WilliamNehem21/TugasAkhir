Currently, the primary deficiencies in information construction within universities include a lack of unified planning, uneven construction levels, and the absence of unified standard construction. As a result, there is no consideration for the overall university structure in the original design and development of application systems within each college or department. This has led to the formation of numerous isolated information islands, necessitating an urgent need for integration of independent application systems and databases to achieve information sharing. 

The Apache Synapse is a lightweight and high-performance enterprise service bus (ESB) that functions as a web service arbitration framework built on the Apache Axis2. Supported by a fast and asynchronous mediation engine, it enables several content interchange formats, including plain text, binary, hessian, and JSON, through a variety of transport adapters. Synapse focuses on routing, conversion, news based on web services, and verified and XML standard registration. 

Designed to facilitate very fast XML routing, Apache Synapse utilizes a streaming XML design based on Apache Axiom. Its completely asynchronous architecture and non-blocking I/O ensure low overhead and the ability to scale and support thousands of concurrent clients without dropping messages. Synapse also provides a consistent model for management strategies and services, enabling efficient and effective management of resources within an organization. Lastly, the implementation of Apache Synapse converts existing application systems into web services, presents information from diverse sources in a unified way through an information portal, and provides unified access control for different users via a standard application interface.
