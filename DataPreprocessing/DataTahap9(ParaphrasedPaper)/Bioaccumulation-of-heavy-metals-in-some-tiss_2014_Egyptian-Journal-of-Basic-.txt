The study analyzed the levels of heavy metals (copper, zinc, lead, cadmium, iron, and manganese) in the liver, gills, and muscles of fourteen fish species from benthic and pelagic habitats in the Egyptian Red Sea. The concentrations of heavy metals varied significantly among fish species and organs. Muscles consistently had the lowest metal concentrations, while the liver was the main organ for copper, zinc, and iron accumulation, and the gills showed the highest concentrations of lead and manganese. Fish species exhibited differences in metal accumulation, potentially due to factors such as age, geographical distribution, and species-specific characteristics. Despite the variations, the recorded metal concentrations generally fell within or below levels reported in similar studies worldwide.

Fish are a beneficial source of protein, essential minerals, vitamins, and unsaturated fatty acids. Nonetheless, being at the top of the aquatic food chain, fish can accumulate heavy metals from their environment, which may pose health risks to humans. Several adverse health effects associated with heavy metal exposure, such as renal failure, liver damage, and cardiovascular diseases, have been well-documented. As a result, various international monitoring programs aim to assess fish quality for human consumption and monitor the health of aquatic ecosystems.

Red Sea, initially considered relatively unpolluted, has shown evidence of heavy metal pollution in recent decades, particularly in areas affected by industrial and anthropogenic activities. This study focused on heavy metal concentrations in fish organs, highlighting the difference in metal accumulation between the benthic and pelagic fish. The study also pointed out the potential health risks associated with consuming fish from certain areas with elevated heavy metal concentrations.

Overall, the study found that essential metals such as copper, zinc, iron, and manganese in the fish were within safe limits for human consumption, but non-essential metals like lead and cadmium were sometimes close to or slightly higher than recommended levels. The study emphasized the need for continuous monitoring of heavy metal levels in fish, especially in potentially polluted areas, to ensure the safety of fish consumption.
