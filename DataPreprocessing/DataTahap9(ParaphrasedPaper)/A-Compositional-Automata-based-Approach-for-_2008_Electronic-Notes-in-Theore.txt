This study introduces a formal language with compositional semantics, along with corresponding model checking algorithms, for the purpose of modeling and verifying multi-agent systems (MAS) at the knowledge level. The language, termed kCTL, extends branching time CTL logic with knowledge operators kk for each agent k, allowing for the observation of events from the perspective of individual agents.

The compositional semantics for kCTL is based on local automata for each agent, in contrast to the global automaton utilized for atel. This approach allows for the separate consideration of local and global computations, enabling agents to interact through message exchange without direct involvement in each other's local computations.

Furthermore, the study presents a formal language and model checking process for verifying multi-agent systems at the knowledge level. The proposed language, kCTL, extends CTL and is accompanied by algorithms for checking its semantics within a branching time model.

The composition of automata involves states represented as n-tuples, with components corresponding to the local states of each agent, and edges representing those of the local automata. Moreover, the composition operation links output actions of one automaton with input actions of other automata.

The study also introduces a logic for reasoning about knowledge in state transition systems, using an extended CTL language with a knowledge observation operator (kk) to capture the occurrence of events from the perspective of automata involved in the system, referred to as kCTL.

Additionally, the study outlines a protocol for sending messages, incorporating local information for the sender and receiver as sets of propositions valid at each state. The communication channel is assumed to retain no local information beyond the current state.

The language kCTL, which includes knowledge operators, has been the subject of recent research in the field of model checking knowledge properties of concurrent systems. This work builds upon previous research and focuses on capturing knowledge relations from automata-based local specifications.
