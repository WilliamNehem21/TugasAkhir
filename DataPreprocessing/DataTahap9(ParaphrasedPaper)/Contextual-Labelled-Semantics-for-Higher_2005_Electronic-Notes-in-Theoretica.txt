This academic paper has three main objectives. The first objective is to explore the principles of designing LTS semantics in higher-order calculi, which involves capturing both computational steps and congruence for higher-order processes. The second objective is to develop an explicit approach for formulating higher-order substitution, which is a fundamental feature that distinguishes higher-order calculus from first-order calculus. This involves establishing a good formulation for the behaviors of a higher-order substituted process, denoted as p{r/x}. The third objective is to devise new techniques for addressing challenging questions in higher-order calculus, such as congruence problems, the factorization theorem, and structuring the theory with greater intuition.

Sangiorgi provided insightful examples of the challenges in addressing the separation between the object part (i.e., the emitted process) and the context of a higher-order output. This separation hinders a satisfactory treatment of the channels private to the two, leading to the problems of higher-order bisimulation. To overcome this challenge, Sangiorgi proposed a contextual bisimulation approach, where the emitted process becomes p'. For instance, the higher-order test label a(u).q indicates that the environment can accept an object emitted by p at port a, provide a continuation q after the interaction, and use the emitted object to instantiate the higher-order variable u in q.

The paper then lays out the syntactical considerations of the calculi, followed by the reduction semantics of the language and the detailed motivation behind the subsequent contextual labelled semantics in section 3. It proceeds to specify the contextual labelled transition semantics and introduces the corresponding bisimulation in section 4, presents the proof of the factorization theorem and congruence properties of the bisimulation in section 5, establishes the correspondence between the labelled transition semantics and reduction semantics in section 6, and concludes with a discussion of related work in section 7.

The paper also discusses the extension of LTS semantics to associate symbolic transition rules for open rules and the difficulty in explicitly formulating the classification of behaviors of a process p{r/x} due to the presence of free variables in p. The authors propose a formulation in a style similar to that in contextual calculi and emphasize the importance of adopting the contextual point of view in formulating a new labelled semantics. It is noted that the correctness of the new labelled semantics can be demonstrated by establishing the correctness between the reduction system and the new labelled semantics. Finally, the paper provides examples to illustrate the internal communication behavior between subprocesses and proves the associated lemmas.
