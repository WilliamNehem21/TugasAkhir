Durian, hailed as the "king of fruit," holds significant agricultural value, with Thailand being the world's leading producer and exporter of this prized commodity. The renowned Mon Thong variety, revered for its delectable sweetness, has contributed to Thailand's status as the foremost durian exporter globally. In 2021, Thailand's fresh durian exports reached an impressive volume of around 900,000 tons, valued at approximately 3 billion dollars, marking a substantial 66.39% increase from the previous year.

A study utilized near-infrared spectroscopy to assess the sweetness of durian pulp through both online (scanning while in motion) and offline (scanning with the sample stationary) methods. The online model attained an r2 of 0.70 and an rmsep of 4.0%, while the offline model achieved an r2 of 0.81 and an rmsep of 3.27%. Additionally, near-infrared hyperspectral imaging was employed to predict dry matter content and classify the ripeness of durian pulp.

Literature indicates the high potential of near-infrared spectroscopy techniques in discerning the maturity and ripeness of durian fruit and pulp, albeit previous methods being destructive or minimally disruptive. Hence, the focal point of this research was to assess the maturity of whole durian fruit utilizing near-infrared spectroscopy under nondestructive conditions. The study aimed to develop a classification model using swnir and lwnir spectroscopy for evaluating the maturity stage of whole durian fruit and identify an optimal non-destructive scanning method.

Durian fruit, specifically the Mon Thong variety, was sourced from the Duangkhae Durian Orchard in Thailand, categorized based on days after blooming (dab), and segregated into three maturity stages: unripe, prematurity, and mature. A subset of durian fruits in the prematurity stage was left to ripen for seven days.

The training model was established using k-fold cross-validation, where the dataset was split into partitions for training and testing. In this research, a 5-fold cross-validation technique was employed, allocating 75% to the training set and 25% to the validation set.

The study classified durian into four stages: unripe, prematurity, maturity, and ripe, with assessment metrics such as true positive (tp), true negative (tn), false positive (fp), and false negative (fn) used to determine classification accuracy. Additionally, the impact of humidity on dry matter content was observed, indicating lower percentages due to increased moisture from environmental factors.

The implementation of near-infrared spectroscopy demonstrated potential in reducing operational time, with various positions of rind combined with stem spectra yielding similar performance. Notably, accurate prediction of durian maturity was achieved using the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classification model developed from specific spectral combinations.

Overall, the study showcased the potential of near-infrared spectroscopy in nondestructively assessing the maturity of durian fruit, offering insights into its ripeness and dry matter content.
