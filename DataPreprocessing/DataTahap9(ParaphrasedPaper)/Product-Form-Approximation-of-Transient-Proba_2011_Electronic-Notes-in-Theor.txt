This paper introduces a new method for approximating transient probabilities in a model without altering the state space. Instead of making reductions and aggregations, the analysis is simplified by assuming that the transient probabilities follow a product form. This assumption allows for a more concise description of the transient probabilities, making it feasible to analyze systems with a large state space that would otherwise be impractical to study.

The technique presented in this paper is most closely related to a previous study in which the authors established a condition for a network of Markovian queues to exhibit transient product form. Specifically, the condition was that the network consisted of infinite server queues. However, since not all reaction networks can be represented as networks of infinite server queues, the product form assumption does not universally hold. Nonetheless, through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that the closer a reaction network resembles a queueing network of infinite servers, the better the approximation will be.

The structure of the paper is as follows: Section 2 provides a brief description of the considered system of reactions. In Section 3, we introduce our approximation approach, while Section 4 discusses properties of the approximation. Section 5 includes numerical examples, and Section 6 draws conclusions.

Our method derives a product form approximation for the transient probabilities of Markov chains representing reaction networks. The computational effort of the method increases linearly with the number of reactants, enabling its application to reaction networks that are infeasible to analyze exactly. Through testing on various examples, we found that the proposed approximation accurately captures the variance and distribution of reactant quantities when the system's average behavior aligns with the mean-field approach or when the transient system behavior closely aligns with a product form.
