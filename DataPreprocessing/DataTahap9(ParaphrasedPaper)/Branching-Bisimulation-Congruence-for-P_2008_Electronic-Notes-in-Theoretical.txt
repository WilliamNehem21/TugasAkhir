The concept of branching bisimulation for the alternating model of probabilistic systems does not constitute a congruence in relation to parallel composition. This paper proposes an alternative definition of branching bisimulation in a more general model that accommodates consecutive probabilistic transitions and demonstrates its compatibility with parallel composition. The study establishes that this new bisimulation is, in fact, the most general congruence relation contained within the existing branching bisimulation when applied to the alternating model.

Originally, branching bisimulation was introduced for the non-alternating model of probabilistic systems, where each action transition leads to a probability distribution of states rather than a single state. The concept was subsequently extended to the fully probabilistic model, which prohibits non-determinism by assigning probabilities to action labels to ensure that the total probability of all outgoing transitions from a state sums up to one. Furthermore, a definition of branching bisimulation was also developed for the strictly alternating model. By utilizing colored traces, the study illustrated that this notion precisely captures the states that are intuitively branching bisimilar. It was noted that this definition applies to the alternating setting, including the non-strictly alternating model.

The paper is structured as follows: in Section 2, probabilistic transition systems are introduced as a generalized alternating model, and the notion of branching bisimulation is defined. Section 3 presents the definition of parallel composition without synchronization for the model and establishes that the branching bisimulation is a congruence in relation to this operator. The paper then demonstrates in Section 4 that the proposed bisimulation is the smallest congruence within the existing branching bisimulation. The final section provides conclusions and outlines potential areas for future research.

A proof is also presented in the paper, illustrating that the probabilistic transition matrix of the merge corresponds to the Kronecker product of the probabilistic transition matrices of the parallel components. It is shown that matrix powers distribute over Kronecker products, leading to the conclusion.

In summary, this paper introduces a definition of branching bisimulation that applies to a general alternating model of probabilistic systems allowing successive probabilistic transitions. The study illustrates its compatibility with parallel composition without synchronization and establishes its status as the most general congruence within the branching bisimulation when applied to the alternating model, thereby resolving the congruence problem. The paper is limited to the generalized alternating model of probabilistic systems and does not consider other models, such as the non-alternating model for which branching bisimulation exists as a congruence. The authors propose future research directions, including investigating the relationship between their branching bisimulation and the notion obtained by adapting a specific mapping to the generalized alternating model.
