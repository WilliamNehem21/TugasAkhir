On the contrary, the individual conducting the quiz, who formulates the computational problem to be solved, conceals the internal representation of polynomials and only offers observers and constructors for manipulating polynomials. Access to the underlying representation is restricted, and the player is unaware of whether the polynomials are specified by coefficients, arithmetic circuits, or another data structure. Consequently, the quizmaster also embodies the concept of information concealment.

In particular, Theorem 4.1 extends the example discussed in Section 3.2, and asserts that there exist polynomials that are easy to assess but challenging to interpolate. This interpolation outcome demonstrates that our quiz game model enables us to derive conclusions not just related to elimination but also pertaining to other issues in scientific computing. For instance, we have results in the realm of neural networks (refer to Section 4.2).

These tools may provide a means to comprehend critical yet somewhat informal concepts in software engineering, such as information concealment. This application may represent a stride towards the aspirations of the semat kernel, which aims to formalize software engineering as a rigorous discipline. Nevertheless, our findings are limited to instances within a very specific mathematical field, specifically algebraic geometry. An open inquiry remains regarding the extension of our model to other challenges; for instance, one potential application of our quiz game model can be found in the domain of neural networks in machine learning.
