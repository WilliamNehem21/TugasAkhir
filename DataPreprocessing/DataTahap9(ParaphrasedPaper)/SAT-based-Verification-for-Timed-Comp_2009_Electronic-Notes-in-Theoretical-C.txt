This paper introduces a SAT-based approach for conducting bounded model checking of timed constraint automata (TCA). The approach involves embedding bounded model checking into propositional logic with linear arithmetic to overcome the state explosion problem and handle large systems. Additionally, the paper outlines a method to incorporate this approach into an extension of counterexample guided abstraction refinement with Craig interpolants to enhance model checking performance.

The paper discusses the significance of timed coordination in component-based software engineering and emphasizes the need for timed constraint automata as a coordination mechanism in networks of timed components exchanging data through multiple channels. It addresses the challenges of state explosion in finite state model checking and proposes a linear-size parallel composition for the logical representation of timed constraint automata to overcome the exponential blow-up obtained by forming the cross product for parallel composition.

Furthermore, the paper highlights the utilization of sophisticated techniques to guide high-end SAT solvers in exploring a narrow fragment of the state space, and it explains how the choice of linear arithmetic/propositional encoding and abstraction refinement techniques can be leveraged to address the challenges associated with infinite states. The authors also describe the extension of the CA editor in the Eclipse Coordination Tools to support the generation and editing of timed constraint automata, along with the implementation of translation of timed constraint automata to propositional formulas with linear arithmetic constraints.

In addition to presenting the main approach and techniques, the paper discusses related work in the field of abstraction refinement and outlines future work and potential applications of the framework, such as integration of back translation from formulas to timed constraint automata in the Eclipse Coordination Tools and verification of connectors within a testing environment of Reo networks.

The paper concludes by emphasizing the benefits of the proposed SAT-based approach for bounded model checking of timed constraint automata and expressing the expectation that the framework developed could be generalized to other scenarios and contribute to a better understanding and verification of the functioning of timed constraint automata and Reo networks.
