The practice of physically isolating networks with different levels of confidentiality is commonly employed to safeguard sensitive data, and information is transmitted unilaterally across these networks. The implementation of an information security module is crucial to ensure the integrity of data in low-confidentiality networks. The use of the MD5 algorithm in digital signatures and RSA arithmetic in the encoding and decoding processes has been validated through experiments to confirm its efficiency and security.

To formalize the division of a 512-bit data block into 16 strings of 32 bits, the variables a, b, c, and d are assigned the primitive values. Each 32-bit string undergoes computation through four rounds, with each round comprising multiple processes. The initial process in the four rounds varies, while the subsequent processes remain consistent. Four distinct nonlinear functions are utilized within the processing.

Following the completion of the four rounds of computation, the values of a, b, c, and d are added separately. Subsequently, the next data group is computed, and the resulting outputs are cascaded to obtain MD5 results upon completion of all data groups.

The data is then formatted using the PKCS format, where eb is expressed as 00 || bt || ps || 00 || d. Here, bt denotes the type of block, ps represents the padding scheme, and d signifies the clear text. A leading 0 is included to ensure the length of eb exceeds a specified value, k. When bt equals 02, it denotes public key encryption, while bt equals 01 signifies private key decryption. When bt equals 02, ps is a non-null random number, and when bt equals 01, the value of ps is ff.

The original clear text is divided from the clear text in PKCS format, with this process also verifying the integrity of the data. Decryption fails if any of the following issues occur: the clear text cannot be divided accurately, the padding scheme is less than 64 bits or does not match the block type labeled by bt, or bt does not align with the practical type.
