An commonly used method for integrating decision procedures (DPs) with other systems is to have the DPs generate proofs of the formulas they ascertain as valid. However, a challenge arises in debugging the code that produces these proofs, as it is easy to inadvertently write code in standard programming languages that generates incorrect proofs. This paper presents a demonstration of how proof-producing DPs can be implemented in a programming language called Rogue-Sigma-Pi (RSP), which incorporates a type system to ensure the correct manipulation of proofs. RSP is a combination of the Rogue rewriting language and the Edinburgh Logical Framework (LF). Programs that are type-correct in RSP are deemed partially correct, ensuring that any putative LF proof object created by a type-correct RSP program is guaranteed to type-check in LF. The paper describes a straightforward proof-producing combination of propositional satisfiability checking and congruence closure implemented in RSP.

The integration of congruence closure with the propositional validity checker follows the "eager" approach, where assignments to atomic formulas are asserted to the decision procedure as they are made. Congruence closure is responsible for promptly notifying satisfiability if the current set of asserted literals is determined to be inconsistent, resulting in the closure of the current branch of the validity check search.

Key assumptions made in this work include the ability to write general programs (tactics) to manipulate higher-order proofs. This assumption is used in a specific case concerning the deduction theorem, where the proof is regarded as a proof-transforming program. Additionally, it is not assumed that these tactics always succeed or possess properties like termination or case coverage.

Furthermore, the paper discusses the differences in the approach adopted for producing proofs from congruence closure in Rogue-Sigma-Pi compared to that in CVC. The paper also addresses the need for verifying the soundness of Rogue-Sigma-Pi with respect to provability in the context of higher-order logic (H=) and potential runtime errors that could affect proof generation. The guarantee provided by RSP is that any proof produced which does not contain the special symbol "null" is ensured to be valid. 

Finally, the paper describes Rogue-Sigma-Pi as an ML-like language with additional features, including support for case analysis based on pattern-matching and general recursion, as well as pattern abstractions used for transforming terms through rewrite rules.
