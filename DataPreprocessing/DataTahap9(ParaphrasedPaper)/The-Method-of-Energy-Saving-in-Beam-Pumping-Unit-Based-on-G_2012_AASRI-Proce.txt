Rotor resistance, denoted as r2, represents the resistance of the rotor. The variable s denotes slip, and the rotor current, denoted as i2, depends on the load current. The total stator current, i1, is composed of i2 and i0, where i0 represents excitation current. The rotor voltage, e2, is approximately equal in magnitude to the stator voltage u. When the load changes, i0 remains constant, and whether the magnitude of i1 changes depends on the load. At low loads, the power factor angle is large while the power factor is small. As the load increases, both i2 and i1 increase, leading to an increase in the power factor. From formula (1), it can be concluded that when the load is constant (i.e., slip does not change), the rotor current remains constant, and the power factor decreases as the voltage increases. Therefore, in light load conditions, in order to achieve a high power factor, the voltage u must be reduced, indicating that the power factor can be increased by reducing the voltage.

The thyristor has been a vital component in the field of power electronics since its inception. It is extensively utilized for power regulation in both AC and DC circuits due to its excellent cost-performance ratio and high capacity, which is unmatched by other devices. The thyristor functions as a switch with unique characteristics that allow for control of high-voltage and high-current circuits by regulating the gate current. The bi-directional thyristor is a key derivative of the thyristor series, capable of replacing a set of general anti-parallel thyristors in AC circuits, making it an ideal AC power control component. To allow the component to conduct AC current, a gate trigger signal must be sent within each half cycle. The component can conduct only when the current exceeds the trigger current, and it can be switched off only when the current falls below the holding current.

In the development of energy-saving components, the thyristor is utilized to control voltage, with the size of the voltage being dependent on the thyristor trigger angle. By employing the theory of genetic algorithms, the thyristor trigger angle is treated as an individual within the genetic algorithm.

The genetic algorithm is a global optimization search algorithm based on the principles of evolution and heredity. By encoding the parameter space and utilizing adaptable probability rules, the genetic algorithm enhances the efficiency of the optimization process. Compared to traditional optimization algorithms, genetic algorithms yield better results in probabilistic optimization. In the context of this paper, the thyristor trigger angle of the current load serves as the individual function of the genetic algorithm, while the measured power factor serves as the evaluation function. Through the application of selection, crossover, and variation theories, the optimal trigger angle is obtained, leading to an optimal voltage that yields the best results. 

The total number of individuals in each generation significantly influences the efficiency and final outcome of the genetic algorithm. A small-scale algorithm may converge to a local optimum, limiting performance, while a large-scale algorithm leads to complex calculations and inefficiencies. Extensive research indicates that the optimal scale range is between 30 and 110, where the initial population is selected through randomly triggering the thyristor angle from 0 to 180. 

The adaptability function size of the genetic algorithm, corresponding to the power factor of the motor, is determined through measurement rather than calculation. The selection algorithm operates based on the adaptability of the individuals, using a select sort method to order individuals based on adaptability and ensuring a proportional sort to produce the next generation.

The crossover operation emulates the process of biological chromosome pairing and is a primary method of generating new individuals. By partially exchanging genetic values of two paired individuals according to specific rules and crossing probability, new individuals are created. The design principle of the crossover operator varies in different situations, but the central goal is to maintain individual coding after producing new individuals.

The variation operation simulates the genetic variation process in biological heredity and evolution by altering the genetic values of chosen individuals. This process enhances population diversity and improves the algorithm's local research capability.

The genetic algorithm halts when it finds the optimal solution or reaches the termination condition. Upon reaching termination, the algorithm outputs the best individual in the population as the optimal solution.
