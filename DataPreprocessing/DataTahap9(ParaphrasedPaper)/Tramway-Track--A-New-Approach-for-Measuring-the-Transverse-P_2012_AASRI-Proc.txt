We observed certain regions of uncertainty at the edges of the points, where the profile exhibited noticeable fluctuations or surpassed a specific threshold level, denoted by three constants [ti, to, ts]. These constants are automatically determined by the algorithm based on the maximum, minimum, and mean deviation values of the two profiles. Within these regions, at each iterative step t, the pixel values populate the matrices {si} and {gi}, which are distinguishable from the matrices {s} and {g}, believed to represent the background and rail, respectively. Consequently, at the iterative step t, the following relationship holds:...
