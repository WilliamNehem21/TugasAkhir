While the given functor is faithful, it lacks the property of being full and does not preserve much of the structure found within the category of games, such as the monoidal structure. Our aim in this study is to address this limitation by progressively refining the target category. This endeavor is connected to previous work by Hyland and Schalk, which is explored further in the subsequent discussion.

We proceed to refine COH by introducing an order relation, designed to mirror the prefix ordering on plays. This refined category, termed P COH, is demonstrated to possess a monoidal structure similar to that of the category of games. Our principal finding is that the Hyland-Schalk functor can be elevated to a fully faithful strong monoidal embedding into a specific subcategory of P COH.
