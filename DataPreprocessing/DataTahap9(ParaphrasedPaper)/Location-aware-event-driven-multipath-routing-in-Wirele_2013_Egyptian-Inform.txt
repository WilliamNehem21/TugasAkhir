This academic paper discusses the need for reliable and energy-efficient paths in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) for the delivery of critical information from event occurrence nodes to sink nodes. It proposes an event-triggered multipath routing scheme using a combination of static and mobile agents. The scheme involves several steps, including computing an arbitrary midpoint between the event and sink nodes, establishing a shortest path using mobile agents, finding the location of intermediate nodes, and constructing a partial topology at the sink node. The paper also discusses existing routing techniques and their drawbacks, and introduces an agent-based intelligent multipath discovery scheme using location information.

The paper further presents a comparison between mobile agent-based approach and simple message passing, and describes the use of mobile agents in event detection and path setup. It also outlines the simulation model for the proposed scheme, and provides an analysis of the results. Additionally, the paper discusses the implications of communication range on the number of disjoint paths.

Overall, the paper proposes a novel event-triggered multipath routing scheme for WSNs and presents a comprehensive analysis of its performance in various network scenarios. It suggests that the use of mobile agents and location information can lead to more robust and energy-efficient routing in WSNs.
