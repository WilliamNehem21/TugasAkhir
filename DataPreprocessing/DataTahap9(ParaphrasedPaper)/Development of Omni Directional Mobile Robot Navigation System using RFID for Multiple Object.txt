The integration of both the omni robot and the RFID system is essential for controlling the entire system. The omni robot's mechanical manipulator capabilities allow for both tethered and autonomous operation, making it a focal point. Additionally, emphasis is placed on the RFID system, which utilizes customized features of RFID technology for navigation. This system includes tags, a reader with an antenna, and software. When an RFID reader scans a tag, it emits a pulse of radio energy, to which the tag responds with an inventory control number.

Following the RFID scan, the mobile robot updates its heading by turning right and left, checking whether the calculated angle matches the compass angle. If not, it continues to turn until the correct angle is reached. Once the correct angle is attained, the mobile robot moves forward and detects additional points. Subsequently, the robot identifies the current tag to determine if it is the goal. If it is, the robot stops; if not, it calculates the current angle towards the goal and continuously compares it to the actual angle until the goal is reached.
