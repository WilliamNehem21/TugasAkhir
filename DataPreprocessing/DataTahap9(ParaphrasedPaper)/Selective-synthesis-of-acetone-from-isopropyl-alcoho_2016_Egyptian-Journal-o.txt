Figure 4(b) illustrates the gradual desorption of acetic acid from the CuO catalyst, with the steady state conversion value being reached after 25 minutes. At this point, the conversion at steady state is 20%, a reduction of 34% compared to the 54% conversion observed for the unsaturated catalyst. These findings indicate a decrease in the basicity of the CuO catalyst. This behavior implies that the reactivity of the catalyst is impacted.

On the other hand, Figure 4(c) depicts the impact of time on the desorption of acetic acid from a CuO catalyst mixed with 30 wt.% NiO. It reveals a rapid desorption process, leading to a swift increase in the conversion of isopropanol (IPA) and the yield of acetone over time. Moreover, the catalyst's activity is nearly fully restored to about 95% after approximately 10 minutes. The remaining 3% value may be ascribed to the adsorption of acetic acid on strong basic sites on the catalyst surface.
