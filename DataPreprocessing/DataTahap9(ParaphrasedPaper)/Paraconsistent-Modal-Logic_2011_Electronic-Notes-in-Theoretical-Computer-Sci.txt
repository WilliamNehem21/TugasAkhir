This paper presents a modal extension of paraconsistent Nelson logic, which also serves as a generalization of the Belnapian modal logic introduced by Odintsov and Wansing. The authors establish algebraic completeness theorems for these logics and provide a representation of their algebras using twist-structures. The interaction of different non-classical approaches, such as many-valued and modal logic, is explored to address modal notions like belief and knowledge in connection with reasoning aspects best handled using many-valued logics. The paper is organized to introduce and study a modal version of paraconsistent Nelson logic, with a focus on defining a system that is comprehensive and well-behaved from an algebraic standpoint. The authors also discuss open problems and future research directions, including the need for further exploration of modal expansions of paraconsistent Nelson logic, as well as the investigation of algebraic representations of MN4-lattices.
