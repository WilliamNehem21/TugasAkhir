The paper discusses the features utilized in fingerprint matching, including local features (minutiae) such as ridge ending and ridge bifurcation, as well as universal features like distinctiveness points such as core and delta. The minutia set is identified as the most commonly used fingerprint feature, from which significant information about a fingerprint can be obtained. The process of fingerprint organization involves coarse mapping with the help of classification and filtering the local singularities mapping. The themes of fingerprint cataloguing, indexing, and repossession have been widely studied. The issue of limited publicly accessible fingerprint databases for training and testing has been addressed by enlarging the training sample set using a proposed spatial modeling method. Various techniques for fingerprint authentication and enhancement have been proposed and discussed in the paper, including methods for handling skin distortion, fingerprint image improvement, and finger texture-based human authentication.

The proposed system for fingerprint image organization involves an adaptive genetic neural network (AGNN), and the results and discussions related to this technique are presented. Moreover, the paper concludes with details on the proposed methodology for finger impression picture management, which consists of denoising the fingerprint image using wave atom transform, enhancing the image quality, and performing morphological operations before classifying the fingerprint image using AGNN.

The AGNN is trained with feature values extracted from each image and is used for fingerprint classification. The network undergoes training with a large set of diverse fingerprint images to enable efficient classification of query images in the testing stage. The modified neural network also incorporates an optimization technique, specifically using a genetic algorithm to enhance weights for testing. The optimization process dynamically adjusts mutation points based on the fitness of the achieved chromosome and alters the mutation rate accordingly. Additionally, the crossover operation is performed to generate new child chromosomes, and selection of chromosomes is based on their fitness values. Finally, the proposed technique is evaluated and compared with available neural network methods to assess its performance in organizing accurate images.
