In section 2, we provide an overview of the Twelf system and its module system, while section 3 delves into the representation of logics within the system. Our primary contribution lies in section 4, which presents a comprehensive representation of first-order logic (FOL), covering its syntax, proof theory, model theory, and soundness proof, all utilizing the module system to handle connectives and quantifiers independently. Notably, the soundness is mechanically verified by Twelf. In section 5, we explore the encoding of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (ZFC) and a translation from the Martin-LÃ¶f type theory (MLTT) to ZFC in Logical Framework (LF), allowing for the representation and reasoning of set-theoretical models within the logical framework.

The Twelf signatures encompass declarations of type or object-level constants, which are defined using various forms of declarations and definitions. The module system in Twelf enables the usage of multiple named signatures, which can be related through inheritance (structures) and translations (views). Views serve to encode translations between two signatures, while structures represent an inheritance relation between signatures. Additionally, inclusion permits the incorporation of one signature into another in a simpler and less expressive manner.

To illustrate, consider a scenario where we have propositional logic with only negation, and the respective signatures "lsyn" and "lpf" representing "neg" and "negpf" from section 2. Furthermore, "lmod" could denote a signature formalizing the two-element boolean lattice. The formalization of this scenario can be carried out in another logic, such as first-order logic, which would need to be included in "lmod." Alternatively, "lmod" could include a complete axiomatization of set theory, allowing "lmod" to map a basic object to the set {0, 1}.

By importing "base," "neg," and "disj" into the signature "pl" via the structures "base," "neg," and "disj," we achieve an encoding of the syntax for propositional logic. The representation of models employed in section 4 uses LF to axiomatize the semantics of logic models. We aim to represent logic models as LF signatures themselves, achieved through a refined version of the signature "lmod" that becomes a syntactical representation of specific logic models.

We also address the encoding of ZFC, which is realized as a variant of first-order logic with a universe set in intuitionistic first-order logic using a description operator. Our study serves as a scalability test for recent developments in logical framework research, including the module system for LF and the proof and model-theoretical framework, demonstrating the successful representation of logic and model theories in LF. However, the representation of set theory poses challenges due to the lack of automated proving support in Twelf, which may necessitate borrowing formalizations from other systems in the future.

In conclusion, we assess both developments positively, finding that the representation of first-order logic was facilitated by the module system, and the representation of model theory was elegant and appealing. Despite the challenges in representing set theory, the logic-independent module system we designed permits cross-framework translations and offers potential for future investigations.
