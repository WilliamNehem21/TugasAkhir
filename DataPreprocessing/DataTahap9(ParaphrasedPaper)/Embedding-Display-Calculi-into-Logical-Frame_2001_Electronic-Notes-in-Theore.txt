Relation algebras serve as extensions of boolean algebras. While boolean algebras characterize subsets of a specific set, relation algebras represent binary relations on the set. Relation algebras feature operations like relational composition and relational converse, in addition to boolean operations such as intersection (conjunction) and complement (negation). These algebras are fundamental to relational databases as well as the specification and verification of program correctness, particularly following the style of Mili.

For the second paragraph, it seems unrelated to the original text about relation algebras. Can you provide additional context or specify the type of paraphrasing needed for this section?
