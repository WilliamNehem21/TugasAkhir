We utilize hybrid logic in conjunction with dlh to realize two significant enhancements: state-based reasoning and introspection. By employing nominals as abstract state labels, our hybrid calculus enables purely symbolic state succession (state-based reasoning) and selectively expands symbolic state transitions only when necessary for progress (expand-on-demand). This capability becomes especially crucial for managing computationally intensive state transitions induced by continuous dynamics. Furthermore, the improved system introspection is facilitated through the provision of satisfaction operators, which enable reference back to states during system evolution.

As an illustration, we consider a segment of the European Train Control System (ETCS) as a running example. In ETCS, the movement of trains is governed by decentralized radio block centers (RBC), which issue or reject movement authorities to trains through wireless communication. The actual acceleration and braking behavior is determined by the train and is subject to constraints such as movement authority limits, weather conditions, and track slopes. Nominals are instrumental in structuring the verification of components, thereby unlocking significant potential for performance improvements during verification. In general, it is more feasible to prove multiple conjectures about smaller subsystems than a single correctness statement about the entire system. Furthermore, by utilizing nominals for introspection, it becomes possible to decompose reasoning for components when correctness hinges on tightly interrelated factors.

The proof hinges on the crucial observation that states of dlh can be entirely characterized by (quantified) variable assignments. Let x be the vector of all variables occurring in a formula, and let i be a vector comprising fresh variables of the same dimension for each nominal i. Through this framework, a reduction can be achieved by employing specific replacements for satisfaction operators or propositional occurrences of nominals.

Chaochen et al. introduced a proof system for the Duration Calculus (DC) extended by durational assertions pertaining to mathematical expressions in real-valued time-dependent states and their derivatives. This system does not provide a constructive treatment of arithmetic; instead, it incorporates an oracle that is tasked with guessing the mathematical conjectures required for proof progress.
