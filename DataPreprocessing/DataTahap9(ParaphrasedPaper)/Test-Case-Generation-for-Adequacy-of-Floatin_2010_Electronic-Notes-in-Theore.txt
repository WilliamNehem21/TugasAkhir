The paper discusses the importance of test suites in testing programs, emphasizing the need for small-sized suites with high code coverage. It outlines the structure of the paper, introducing various metrics for assessing the closeness of functions, presenting methods for generating better test suites and identifying the best test cases, and sharing experimental results. The threshold metric is defined as the percentage of good test cases in a given suite, and the paper proposes using tabu search and genetic algorithm as effective methods for improving test suites.

The paper also touches on roundoff error analysis and the use of optimization methods in testing. It discusses future work, including the exploration of quasi-monte carlo methods and the incorporation of function implementation analysis.
