The process of modular exponentiation is a critical component within cryptographic algorithms. Two primary binary methods, the most significant bit (MSB)-first approach and the least significant bit (LSB)-first approach, are utilized for computing modular exponentiation. In the LSB-first approach, concurrent execution of modular multiplication and squaring operations is employed to reduce processing time. Various efforts have been made in the literature to consolidate multiplication and squaring operations into a unified structure in order to enhance performance and hardware utilization. However, the suggested combined multiplier-squarer structures are specialized and dedicated.

This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides a brief overview of the combined polynomial multiplication-squaring algorithm in GF 2m. Section 3 elaborates on its associated dependency graph (DG). Section 4 describes the exploration of a two-dimensional word-based SISO systolic processor. In Section 5, the area and delay complexities of the proposed design are presented, comparing them to the best existing word-serial designs. Finally, Section 6 concludes the work.

The outputs of CW and CE solely impact the south output CS. Consequently, at time 'n', output CW is valid while output CS is not, as it necessitates the addition of CE. This leads to an increase in the total number of iterations required to produce the final result by one time step. Therefore, the total number of iterations needed to complete the combined multiplication/squaring computation can be determined by evaluating the existing word-serial multiplier structures in terms of area and time complexities (as represented by latency and critical path delay).

The area complexity is estimated in terms of the numbers of tri-state buffers, 2-input AND gates, 2-input XOR gates, 2-input multiplexers, and flip-flops. Meanwhile, time complexity is represented by latency and critical path delay (CPD).
