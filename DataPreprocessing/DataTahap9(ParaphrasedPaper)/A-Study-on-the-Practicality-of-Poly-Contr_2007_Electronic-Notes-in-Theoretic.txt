The primary goal of partial evaluation (PE) is to specialize a program with respect to a portion of its input, known as the static data. The quality of the resulting code produced by PE is heavily influenced by the control strategy utilized. However, finding control rules that yield optimal results for all programs remains a challenge. Poly-controlled partial evaluation (PCPE) seeks to address this issue by employing a combination of global and local control rules, rather than a singular predetermined combination as employed in traditional PE algorithms. This allows for the use of different control rules for different call patterns (atoms), thereby enabling the generation of specialized programs not achievable through traditional PE with individual control rules.

Existing PE tools often offer numerous global and local control strategies, along with various other parameters affecting the quality of the output. However, for both novice and experienced users, determining the appropriate parameter combination to achieve desired results can be a challenging task. PCPE addresses this issue by enabling users to simultaneously experiment with different parameter combinations to attain a specialized program with specific characteristics.

Furthermore, PCPE involves the generation of a set of specialized programs through the utilization of global and local control rules and the subsequent association of these programs with the root-to-leaf derivations of trees. Additionally, PCPE facilitates the iterative handling of atoms, ensuring that the atoms are properly abstracted and controlled to guarantee termination and the generation of specialized programs.

Traditional PE algorithms for logic programs are parametric with respect to the global and local control rules, with a singular specialization strategy applied to all call patterns in the residual program. However, PCPE deviates from this approach by allowing for the use of multiple specialization strategies, thereby addressing the limitations of existing PE algorithms.

In practical applications, PCPE has demonstrated the capability to produce diverse, specialized solutions that are not attainable through traditional PE methods. Experimental results have indicated the potential for PCPE to yield specialized programs with varying fitness values, demonstrating its effectiveness in providing heterogeneous solutions.

Furthermore, PCPE's use of the spsr heuristic has shown promising results in preserving the best solutions while still being able to prune redundant solutions. Despite this success, it is important to carefully manage the search space to avoid eliminating potentially valuable solutions.

In summary, PCPE offers a flexible and effective approach to partial program specialization, demonstrating the ability to produce a diverse set of specialized solutions, many of which are not achievable through traditional PE methods. Additionally, experimental results have shown the potential for PCPE to yield specialized programs with varying fitness values, underscoring its effectiveness in providing heterogeneous solutions.
