A variety of tools utilizing different approaches are currently being utilized for the implementation of domain-specific languages (DSLs). However, there is a lack of consensus regarding the most suitable approach for a given problem within the DSL community. This discrepancy can be attributed to a lack of understanding within the community. This paper aims to enhance the comprehension of the strengths and weaknesses of four approaches by executing a common DSL case study and presenting a comparative analysis of these approaches.

The intentional domain workbench (IDW) and the language workbench Jetbrains MPS exemplify the new class of tools being utilized. Both workbenches provide an integrated development environment (IDE) with underlying base languages. For instance, IDW is equipped with the CL1 language, while MPS comes with three base languages: structure, editor, and semantics. These language building tools enable the development and integration of DSLs to implement domain-specific applications.

The paper evaluates four approaches to DSL implementation through a case study that simulates a state machine language. The case study is indicative of a broader range of DSLs that have been implemented. The structure of the paper includes the introduction of the case study in Section 2, followed by the basis for DSL implementation in ANTLR, Ruby, Stratego, and Converge in Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7, respectively. Section 8 presents a comparative analysis of the four DSL tools and their approaches, based on selected dimensions and metrics. Section 9 discusses the relative strengths and weaknesses of the four DSL tools, based on the authors' experiences.

ANTLR is a parser generator tool that facilitates the implementation of language translators. In Ruby, DSLs are essentially host language constructs, and guarantees regarding well-formedness are provided by the Ruby interpreter. In Stratego, few guarantees are given with respect to producing a syntactically and semantically well-formed target Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). The Converge compiler guarantees the syntactic and semantic well-formedness of the translated host language constructs at the time of translation.

The paper also explores aspects of reusability and error reporting across the four DSL implementation approaches. It concludes by highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, serving as a guideline for future DSL implementations.
