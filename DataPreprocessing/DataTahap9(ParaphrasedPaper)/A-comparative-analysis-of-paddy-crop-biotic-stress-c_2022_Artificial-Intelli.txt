The use of deep learning tools and techniques is widespread in the agriculture sector, and this paper proposes an automated method for detecting and classifying paddy crop biotic stresses using pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) models. The study compares several leading CNN models - namely, Inception-V3, VGG-16, ResNet-50, DenseNet-121, and MobileNet-28 - using transfer learning from the ImageNet weights. The experiment focuses on three common and destructive paddy crop biotic stresses - brown spot, hispa, and leaf blast - which occur during the flowering and ripening growth stages. The results demonstrate that the ResNet-50 model achieves the highest average paddy crop stress classification accuracy of 92.61%, outperforming the other CNN models considered. The research not only explores the feasibility of using CNN models for paddy crop stress identification, but also considers the potential applicability of automated methods for non-experts.
