The data was analyzed using descriptive statistics to characterize and comprehend the data, while multiple regression analysis was employed to evaluate the research model. Additionally, t-tests and ANOVA were utilized to investigate discrepancies among students based on their demographics. The regression analysis revealed that individual determinants such as attitude (b=.32), subjective norm (b=.22), and university support (b=.18) had a significant influence on behavioral intention (BI) at the .001% level. Perceived e-learning accessibility (b=.12) significantly influenced BI at the .01% level, whereas internet self-efficacy (b=.083) was significant at a lower level.

These factors collectively accounted for 56% of the variance in perceived usefulness (PU), a substantially larger effect than typical (Cohen, 1988). Conversely, internet experience (IE) (b=.06) was not found to have a significant relationship with PU, leading to the rejection of hypothesis 9.

It was observed that male students reported a greater intention to use e-learning compared to female students, although the difference in the means was minimal (g2= 0.02). Furthermore, another t-test was conducted to assess differences in intention to use e-learning based on students' place of residence, but no statistically significant difference was found.

The study also found that external students displayed a greater intention to use e-learning compared to regular students. This preference for e-learning among external students may be attributed to the benefits of e-learning systems, such as flexibility and interactivity (Taylor and Todd, 1995; Ndubisi, 2006). Moreover, variations in intention to use e-learning based on students' faculty were identified.

Given the strong impact of attitude toward e-learning on intention to use e-learning, it is recommended that policymakers focus on fostering positive attitudes toward e-learning among potential e-learners, particularly male and external students. Emphasizing the usefulness of e-learning to potential users may be a strategy to achieve this goal. Furthermore, designers of e-learning systems should consider the benefits of flexibility and interactivity perceived by students and incorporate these features into e-learning programs.

The study had certain limitations, including the scarcity of information on e-learning in Saudi Arabia at the time of the study, reliance on a sample that may not be fully representative of the broader population, and the use of self-reported measures, which have associated weaknesses and concerns.
