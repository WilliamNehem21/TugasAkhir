Prolonged periods of using agricultural machinery can lead to discomfort and musculoskeletal disorders in the back and feet, which result from the generation of energy substrates, metabolic fatigue, tissue strain, and deformation due to compression.

While custom grade lower limb force transducers have mainly been developed and tested for sports or medical purposes, a force transducer with a hall-effect sensor mounted between the crank and pedal has been created to measure actuation forces and power during bicycle pedaling, demonstrating an accuracy of 97%. Additionally, a pedal instrumented with strain gauges and a piezoresistive dynamometer have been developed to measure actuation forces and peak torque during cycling, with reported accuracies of 97% and 99% respectively. These systems are typically used in controlled laboratory conditions and are accompanied by complex data logging systems. However, no such system has been developed or tested for agricultural machinery operations in real field conditions with minimal data recording complexities. Therefore, a study was conducted to develop a customized instrumented foot transducer (IFT) system integrated with a simplified data visualization and logging system to assess dynamic forces exerted by lower limbs during agricultural machinery operations, including preliminary evaluations under various load impositions and real operating conditions. 

The IFT system involves magnet cells along the operation stroke, with the position of each magnet cell being registered by a hall-effect sensor, and the pertinent actuation forces detected by IFTs at these positions being recorded. The position-stamped force data is then stored on-board the memory card, displayed on the LCD screen, and transmitted via serial communication to the receiving computer.

The support forces exerted by the IFTs were found to be 95.2 N, 128.6 N, and 175 N at external loads of 5 N, 10 N, and 15 N, respectively. Additionally, the maximum force was observed at the topmost position, while the minimum force was exerted at the bottommost position of the treadle platform.

The customized instrumented foot transducers were successfully developed and preliminarily evaluated for measuring forces exerted by lower limbs during typical small to large-scale agricultural operations such as treadling, pedaling, and using foot-operated systems on tractors or other machinery. The system features custom load sensors based on strain gauges, which are integrated with a single board computer for data logging, on-board storage, and real-time visualization. Evaluation of the system for pedaling operation indicated peak pedal actuation forces for the left foot and right foot in the ranges of 73 N to 145.4 N and 41 N to 131.7 N, respectively.

The system's major advantages include operator friendliness and limited dependencies for field evaluations, making it useful for dynamic force assessment at different positions and joint angles during various working postures. This capability allows for risk assessment of the operation and may be utilized by agricultural machinery manufacturers for force assessments, design reconsiderations, and enhancing safety features to mitigate musculoskeletal disorders resulting from improper design and dimensions. Furthermore, ergonomists can develop protocols for efficient work-rest schedules relevant to any operation. The system may also find high applicability in developing countries where small-scale growers and agricultural machinery are prevalent on farms.
