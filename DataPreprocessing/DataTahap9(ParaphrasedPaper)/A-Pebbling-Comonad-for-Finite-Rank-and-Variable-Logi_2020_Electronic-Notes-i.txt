A semantic explanation of the interaction between first-order structures and formulas with bounded variable count is presented in this academic paper. The paper also provides a semantic description of the parameter of tree-width by examining coalgebras of the pebbling comonad. The first section offers an overview of quantifier rank and variable count, and their correlation with tree-width and tree-depth. In the second section, the paper combines the pebbling comonad and the ehrenfeucht-fraisse comonad (analogous to the pebbling comonad but for quantifier rank) to create a unified comonad that captures both quantifier rank and variable count, with coalgebras that can represent both tree-depth and tree-width. This is a slight modification of the comonads introduced elsewhere, and the paper also presents a novel approach to generalizing the comonads to handle constants in the signature and free variables.
