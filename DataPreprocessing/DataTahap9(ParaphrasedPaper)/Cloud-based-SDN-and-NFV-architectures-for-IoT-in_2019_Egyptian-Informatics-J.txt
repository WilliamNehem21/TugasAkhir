It is crucial to consider various factors that contribute to the cost of deploying networks to support the interconnection of numerous IoT devices. The diverse nature of these end devices necessitates specialized network behavior and services to operate them effectively. Different applications require distinct network policies to handle their data traffic based on factors such as confidentiality, integrity, and overall security. Traditionally, specialized network functionality was built in hardware to expedite network operations, and these devices were strategically positioned in the network based on the services offered by the network service providers.

The primary solution to these challenges lies in network virtualization. Through this approach, all network elements can be programmed using a single standard user interface and remotely controlled from selected central locations. Under this framework, network operations will be fully automated, as network elements will be implemented entirely in software. The functionality of a specific network element can easily be altered by redefining its network function. The aim of future-generation networks is to have the capability to create, control, and manage networks of virtual resources comprising interconnected virtualized network functions (VNFs). This would enable the alteration of network topology without manual intervention and the adjustment of VNF capacities according to demand, thus ensuring consistent service quality in line with contractual agreements.

Another significant architecture proposes a complete transformation of the current network device manufacturing process, advocating for the separation of the control plane from hardware and the production of general-purpose network devices dedicated solely to data forwarding. Software controllers would be separate and dynamic, and cloud networks would leverage a software virtualization framework to offer multitenancy features. The challenge lies in effectively allocating and isolating underlying resources to support multiple applications on the same hardware and software infrastructure, while also ensuring that the introduction of new applications does not compromise the performance of existing ones.

Industry experts predict that the predominant sources of data in the future will be IoT devices and social networks, with significant concerns regarding the trustworthiness and accessibility of big data. Moreover, the speed of data transfer is crucial for enabling swift correlation and exchange of knowledge and information, ultimately facilitating timely decision-making. The success of data analysis activities is heavily reliant on the availability of relevant data, as accurate data analysis informs sound decisions that can significantly impact business activities and competitiveness.

The VNF architecture comprises three fundamental components: physical hardware, the virtual hypervisor layer, and virtual machines, with the key advantage being the incorporation of general-purpose commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) servers in enterprise-class networks for big data processing. Additionally, the physical layer processing of cellular mobile networks can be carried out on these COTS servers, marking a significant transformation in cellular network architecture. However, the performance of such networks and their potential cost and energy savings require further validation through active user trials and empirical studies.

The comparison of costs and energy consumption between different technologies entails considering various hardware-specific aspects, and empirical results will be crucial in determining the actual cost and energy consumption. However, industry reports suggest that new COTS-based server platforms have become more powerful in emulating the packet processing speeds of specialized network hardware while consuming less power. This data serves as a variable parameter for studying the relative cost and energy consumption between SDN/NFV networks and 4G networks, providing insights into potential cost and energy savings as a function of several important factors.
