The autonomous nature of sensors is not as described earlier in this paper, as they lack the capability to form opinions. Instead, a proprietary context-management framework is employed to handle sensors. This framework hides the technical details of sensors and provides service developers with an abstract view of the sensor network. The paper outlines the context-management framework in Section 2 and its role in context-based authentication, while Section 6 details the experimental setup used to assess the reliability of the identification and authentication algorithm. The experiments involve a test-case scenario with two identities, Bob and Alice, moving between different rooms. Additionally, Section 7 provides a discussion of related work in context-aware authentication and location positioning systems, and Section 8 concludes the paper by addressing future work.

The context-management framework facilitates context-based authentication by utilizing the sensor network to understand the relationship between context, such as the location of identification tokens, and the identity of a user at a specific location (e.g., a coffee corner). In a broader context, factors such as user appointments in Microsoft Outlook agendas can also contribute to the overall context.

The context information provided by the sensor network, facilitated by the context-management framework, is used to evaluate the overall level of authentication of an identity. This level, represented by a real number between 0 and 1, reflects the trustworthiness of the emerging identity. Authentication is a continuous process due to the continuous collection of context information, and a user remains authenticated unless there is a change in context, such as the user leaving a space or a context datum becoming invalid.

The sensors themselves are passive objects without intelligent capabilities. The context-management framework collects sensor data over time and calculates opinions on behalf of the sensors. While the paper refers to sensors as autonomous recommenders, it is important to note that this interpretation is based on the existence of the context-management framework.

The paper also discusses the uncertainty associated with the authentication process and highlights considerations for ensuring accurate authentication. It mentions that the disposition of the sensor network and the size of sensor cells can impact the authentication process. Additionally, the paper addresses the idea of extending the framework with a reputation network for sensors, which would allow opinions from sensors to be discounted or discarded based on the reputation of the sensors.

Finally, the paper reports the results of experiments, which confirm the effectiveness of the context-based authentication solution in correctly recognizing and authenticating identities in a given location. The impact of the sensor disposition and the location of the proximity service on the authentication process is discussed, emphasizing the importance of treating uncertainty brought by sensors properly. Additionally, the paper discusses plans to integrate the algorithm implementation with a colleague radar application and to demonstrate user authentication using the theory presented in the paper.
