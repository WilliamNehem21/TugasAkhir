The use of machine learning (ML) has displayed promising results in the fields of classification and prediction, with applications in sports prediction gaining increased attention. This is driven in part by the substantial financial interests involved in sports betting, as well as the desire of club managers and owners to develop effective strategies for winning matches. The models utilized in sports prediction are informed by various factors, such as historical match results, player performance indicators, and information about opponents. This paper critically assesses existing literature on ML, focusing specifically on the use of artificial neural networks (ANN) for the prediction of sports results. The analysis considers the learning methodologies, data sources, methods for evaluating model performance, and challenges specific to predicting sports outcomes, culminating in the proposal of a new framework for sport prediction that leverages ML as a learning strategy. The intended audience for this research includes researchers, sports enthusiasts, club managers, bookmakers, academics, and students interested in leveraging ANN for sports prediction.

The paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 reviews studies that have exclusively employed ANNs, which have been the predominant approach in earlier research on sports prediction. Section 3 offers critical discussion and observations on prior work within the proposed framework, conventional measures of model performance, and proposed methods of measuring performance for sports result prediction. Finally, Section 4 concludes the paper.

In previous research, Purucker investigated the use of an ANN model for predicting results in the National Football League (NFL) by utilizing data from the first eight rounds of the competition and five features. The study demonstrated the effectiveness of the backpropagation (BP) algorithm in achieving 61% accuracy, albeit lower than the 72% accuracy achieved by domain experts. Another study focused on predicting javelin throw lengths using a neural network model, indicating superior predictive quality compared to a nonlinear regression model. Additionally, Wiseman applied various regression models, including neural network regression, to predict winning scores in PGA golf tournaments based on round 1 scores.

Furthermore, the paper recognizes the significance of utilizing expert opinion in refining predictive models and discusses the importance of evaluating model performance through classification matrix analysis and other relevant measures. Additionally, the challenges of obtaining and automating data collection for sports prediction are highlighted, encompassing aspects such as data sources and end-user interface development.

Ultimately, the paper underscores the need for advancements in sports prediction frameworks, particularly through the utilization of ANN, to address various challenges and improve predictive accuracy across different sports.
