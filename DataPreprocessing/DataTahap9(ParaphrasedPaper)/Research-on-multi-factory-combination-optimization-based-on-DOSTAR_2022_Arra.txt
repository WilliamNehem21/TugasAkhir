The paper discusses the increasingly evident role of humans as data sources and the fusion of human-machine-physical ternary data, which forms the basis for knowledge discovery. Domain ontology is used to associate large datasets, enabling the extraction of knowledge and the development of a corresponding combination model. This process facilitates effective decision-making through knowledge management and optimization.

The paper introduces the Dostar method, which is proposed for combinatorial optimization based on the fusion of human-machine-physical ternary data. The method aims to address practical problems in complex manufacturing networks, which will be the focus of the following content.

The study aims to enhance the efficiency of quality traceability for water heaters in business scenarios characterized by multiple data sources, decision makers, spatial and temporal constraints, and strong data correlation. As a result, the paper will separately delve into the study of data fusion, decision weighting based on AHP, spatiotemporal data, ontology, and domain knowledge.

The study explores various aspects of combinatorial optimization and its application in different decision-making preferences for production and distribution plans. It also reviews the integration of combinatorial optimization and collaborative filtering in a complex service network to improve service efficiency. However, existing studies often fail to incorporate the relationship between key factors into the model comprehensively.

The involvement of humans in the loop of data collection is highlighted, particularly in simulating human factors and integrating the data obtained with cyberspace and the Internet of Things. The paper also discusses the use of reinforcement learning in the context of discovering knowledge and the challenges associated with its application.

The complexity of quality traceability for water heaters is discussed, emphasizing the need for a significant improvement in work efficiency due to the involvement of multiple responsible parties, disparate data types, and stakeholder goals. The research spans a diverse range of steps, beginning with data collection in the complex manufacturing environment, followed by the establishment of domain ontology and the transformation of spatiotemporal data into weight values.

The paper also delves into the application of domain ontology in the complex manufacturing environment, including systematic planning, quality assurance, and coordination meetings. It emphasizes the significance of text mining in this context and the potential uses of various sources as the basis for ontology construction.

The six-tuple model is introduced to represent different weights associated with decision-making factors, and the importance of maintaining the consistency of decision-making results is stressed. Additionally, the paper presents a fusion model for associative knowledge discovery, integrating big data from multiple dimensions and perspectives through domain ontology and the AHP sub-model.

In conclusion, the paper provides innovative ideas and a method for addressing challenges related to the optimization of manufacturing networks. It also identifies areas for potential future research, including the debugging of the multiagent reinforcement learning model and expanding the scope of data collection for more detailed knowledge discovery.
