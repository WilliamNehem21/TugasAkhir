The authors of this academic paper have introduced an automated verification technique for validating trace-based information flow properties in finite state systems. They have shown that the basic security predicates (BSPs) as defined by Mantel can be described using regularity-preserving language operations. This enables the development of a decision procedure for determining whether a finite state system satisfies a specific BSP, making the technique comprehensive for all information flow properties expressed in terms of BSPs.

In the context of computing system security, regulating, restricting, and managing the flow of information is essential. While access control policies are effective in restricting direct information flow, they are unable to control information leakage through covert channels, such as observable behavior, trojan horses, or time and space availability.

Prior work on verifying trace-based security properties has mainly relied on unwinding theorems as a verification technique. However, the authors argue that these techniques are not always necessary due to their reliance on the system structure rather than the language of traces generated by the system. In contrast, the authors have proposed a decision procedure based on language inclusion, specifically L-ins, and have demonstrated the construction of L-ins-con-markc',v'(l) to automatically verify trace-based information flow properties of finite state systems. By characterizing the properties in terms of language-theoretic operations, the authors have achieved a complete understanding of the properties, surpassing the capabilities of previous techniques in the literature.
