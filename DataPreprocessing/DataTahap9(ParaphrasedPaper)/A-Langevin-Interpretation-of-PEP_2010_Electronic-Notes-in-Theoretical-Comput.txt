The use of stochastic modeling in computer systems through Markov processes and stochastic process algebras, such as PEPA, has proven to be highly successful. It has enhanced comprehension of the systems under study, enabled accurate prediction of rare behaviors, and facilitated the engineering of computer systems. However, a major limitation of Markovian methods lies in the rapidly expanding underlying state space as additional components and/or component-types are introduced.

One area worth considering is the exploration of sde-approximations for heavily loaded queues, given the strong connection between queueing systems and Markov processes. While various authors have explored this concept, an overarching assumption in these approaches is the presence of heavy traffic, which may not always be suitable for the systems being modeled.

A more substantial concern is that existing models are developed based on the structure of the entire system, making it challenging to derive an sde description of a generic PEPA model. Consequently, each model would need to be customized without any assurance of feasibility, which is unsatisfactory for our objectives.

As an initial illustration, we examine a straightforward system transitioning through two phases, similar to a server alternating between busy and idle states. We employ the PEPA language to represent this system. Although the system resets quickly, leading to a low number of servers in phase 2, this behavior is not exclusive to systems with a low overall component count. It arises whenever any component-type can reach a low population, particularly when interacting with a high-population component-type, resulting in larger noise terms and increased likelihood of negative values. This phenomenon is especially relevant for modeling instantaneous state-transitions with fast rates.

For instance, in the aforementioned server-client system, if all servers are in phase 2, no client can transition from phase 1 to phase 2. However, a server can transition from phase 2 to phase 1, leading to an increase in the server population of type 1. We propose that this stochastic process with weakly absorbing boundaries may resemble Brownian motion, though we provide no formal proof for this intuition in this paper.

In a practical context, investigating more complex models and assessing the consistency between SSA and SDE results would be worthwhile. Furthermore, exploring models where stochastic behavior qualitatively differs from ODE behavior and establishing a formal translation from PEPA models to SDE models directly would be of considerable practical value. We do not anticipate encountering any difficulties with such a translation.
