The first layer consists of units with weights between them all set to unity, while the third layer comprises units generating output through a weighted linear sum of all the node activations in the second layer. To train RBF-based networks, it is essential to determine the number of RBFs (m) and assign centroid vectors (ci). Typically, clustering algorithms such as k-means or learning vector quantization (LVQ) are used for this purpose. These algorithms iteratively refine initial prototypes selected from the training dataset. Recent work has proposed an improved version of the standard k-means algorithm to address heavily-tailed samples or outliers in the data. Additionally, the orthogonal least squares (OLS) method and evolutionary computation techniques such as particle swarm optimization (PSO) have also been utilized for determining center locations.

The hierarchical clustering algorithm is used to generate cluster means, which are then assigned as the centroid vectors of an RBF network. As the level of hierarchy increases, the number of cluster means decreases due to the agglomerative nature of the algorithm, resulting in a coarser data representation and potentially poorer performance. Therefore, selecting a hierarchical level for obtaining cluster means, each assigned as the corresponding centroid vector of an RBF, involves a trade-off between performance and the number of RBFS in the network.
