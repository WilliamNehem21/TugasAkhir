This paper introduces an agent-based approach for designing and simulating the fundamental services of the Time-Triggered Protocol (TTP) for automotive distributed embedded systems, such as the startup algorithm, membership, message sending and reception, and error detection and handling. The proposed architecture is represented as a multi-agent system and is implemented in the JADE platform, primarily following the O-MaSE methodology. Utilizing JADE, an ontology has been developed to automatically interpret frame fields.

The burgeoning demand for safety-critical real-time control applications in the automotive domain has necessitated the development of the Time-Triggered Protocol (TTP), which is a family of field bus protocols based on the time-triggered architecture (TTA). TTA provides a logical bus connecting host computers that implement the chosen application and offers services for organizing applications in a fault-tolerant manner. Each host computer links to the system through a TTA controller.

The paper briefly outlines relevant works on TTP modeling and simulation, including the application of the object-oriented paradigm to design and implement a software simulator for the official TTP/C specification. The author also presents SIDERA (Simulation Model for Dependable Real-Time Architectures) for simulating various real-time protocol services. The literature review underscores a lack of works targeting the simulation of TTP services using the agent paradigm, motivating the present work to demonstrate the effective utilization of the agent paradigm for modeling and simulating TTP basic services.

The TTA is comprised of one or more clusters, each consisting of interconnected nodes via a shared media, with communication between clusters facilitated by gateways. Each node comprises the host computer running the application, a communication controller based on the TTP protocol, and various components such as the protocol processor, message descriptor list, and bus guardian.

Given the complexity of TTP, traditional methods may not fully address all protocol aspects. Consequently, the O-MaSE methodology, an extended version of MASE, has been employed to design the multi-agent organization. The paper highlights the use of JADE platform for implementing the multi-agent TTP protocol services, leveraging its support for defining new ontologies and creating new communication protocols.

The study proposes developing a new ontology for automatic interpretation of frame fields and integrates the JADE platform with Java Eclipse to create a graphical interface and implement the TTP cluster and node organization. As a perspective, the authors plan to extend the agent paradigm to model other automotive protocols, such as CAN and FlexRay, based on different architectures.

Overall, the paper investigates the use of the agent paradigm to model and simulate the basic services of the TTP protocol. It employs the O-MaSE methodology and the JADE platform for system implementation and simulation and plans to extend this approach to model other automotive protocols.
