The greedy coloring algorithm operates by selecting the next vertex and assigning it the lowest available color. For each vertex v, the first available color is the smallest non-negative color that has not been assigned to v's neighbors. The algorithm can employ heuristic methods to choose the next vertex, thereby enhancing efficiency by using fewer colors. Heuristic methods such as first fit, largest degree ordering, saturation degree ordering, and their combinations have been suggested [4, 12] to achieve this goal.

The neighbors of a vertex, referred to as assigning vertices, assign the first available color to themselves and their neighbors, and can also utilize heuristic methods. In this context, the Greedy Distance-Vector Coloring Algorithm (GDVCA) reduces the number of colors and improves efficiency. Unlike the Distributed Vertex Coloring Algorithm (DVCA), GDVCA can solve the Balanced Complete Path (BCP) or Balanced Maximum Coloring Path (BMCP) without increasing time and communication complexities, as there are no other distributed algorithms available for these problems.

In wireless networks, communication costs typically outweigh local computation costs. The process of message exchange, including composing a frame, channel listening, transmission, and frame decomposition, often consumes more time and energy than computations [35, 36]. GDVCA demonstrates high efficiency and significantly lower communication costs and power consumption, which is crucial in wireless networks. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: the next section reviews related works on vertex coloring algorithms, followed by the definition and formulation of the four coloring problems in section 3. Section 4 describes the GDVCA algorithm, while section 5 demonstrates its efficacy on 33 benchmark instances for the four vertex coloring problems. The paper concludes with section 6.

In GDVCA, nodes (vertices) access the channel using slotted Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA) to determine the channel's availability before transmission.

The algorithm ensures that each vertex efficiently broadcasts a message and utilizes the minimum number of bits. Additionally, GDVCA has a limited number of interfering/conflicting nodes for each vertex, making it possible to color the graph in a finite time, even as the number of vertices approaches infinity. The algorithm has been proven to exhibit interesting features when applied to special graphs.

To evaluate GDVCA's performance, 33 benchmark geometric instances are used. These instances consist of three types: geomn, geomna, and geomnb, with 'n' representing the number of vertices in the graph. The graphs are randomly generated on a 10,000 by 10,000 grid, and the vertices are connected based on proximity, with edge weights inversely proportional to the distance between the corresponding vertices. The weights of the vertices are uniformly and randomly generated.

The paper proposes GDVCA as a distributed vertex coloring algorithm for addressing vertex coloring problems in wireless networks. The existing algorithms for these problems face significant challenges that limit their practical utility, especially in wireless networks. Therefore, GDVCA is presented as a solution to overcome these challenges and effectively address vertex coloring problems in wireless networks.
