In this paper, we present a programming methodology for quantum computation using mixed states, which expand upon the traditional quantum systems by allowing the system's state to be a probabilistic distribution of pure states. This extends the work of Aharonov et al. from quantum circuits to both probabilistic and quantum programs.

Generally, an observable is denoted by a self-adjoint operator, and its measurable values are exactly the eigenvalues of that operator. This is a generalization, as the eigenspaces of a self-adjoint operator are known to be pairwise orthogonal and complete the enveloping space according to the spectral theorem. This definition holds true for an observable defined by a self-adjoint operator O.

We also introduce a unitary variant of finalization employing the dilation technique. The unitary embedding, denoted as D, can be effectively extended to work with quantum registers (quregs), maintaining the same notation for simplicity. It is important to note that D actually depends on the observable being mimicked, as the dimension of the enveloping space increases with the number of potential measurement outcomes.
