Assuming the reader is familiar with standard category theory as presented in [reference], we have had to use certain constructions to abstract away from the category set. Some readers may not be familiar with these constructions, so we provide a brief definition here, with more details available in [18, 3].

In Section 5, when we consider the dual of this construction, a similar approach as above will not be feasible because we are interested in the limit of co-chains, and there is no guarantee that an accessible endofunctor will preserve such limits. Consequently, the rank of the cofree comonad over an accessible endofunctor may increase. This change in rank is the source of the technical challenges that will arise in Section 5.

From this, we can interpret "sn" as defining the terms of depth at most "n". For example, s0(x) contains the variables "x", and s1(x) contains the variables "x", along with the canonical element of 1 representing the unit of the monoid, as well as a pair of elements of s0(x) which can be considered as the multiplication of these elements.

It is important to remember that the core of the categorical approach to universal algebra is adjunction (4). The dualization described in this section can be summarized as replacing the left adjoint to u with a right adjoint, and substituting monads with comonads. As a result, the definition of a cosignature turns out to be formally the same as that of a signature.
