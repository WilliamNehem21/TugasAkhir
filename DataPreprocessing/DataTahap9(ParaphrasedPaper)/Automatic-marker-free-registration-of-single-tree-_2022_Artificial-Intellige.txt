There are two main types of methods for registering point clouds: marker-based and marker-free. Marker-based registration involves placing artificial markers at the scene and identifying these markers in different scans to establish correspondences. This method is accurate and reliable but has limitations, such as difficulty in placing markers in complex environments and time-consuming processes in the field.

Our proposed method for point-cloud registration involves a coarse-to-fine strategy. In the coarse registration step, each 3D point cloud is projected onto a sphere to generate 2D images for feature-point extraction, which is used to estimate the transformation matrix. In the fine registration step, point-cloud slicing and fitting methods are used to extract trunk and branch centers to calculate the fine transformation parameters.

The projection of 3D point clouds onto 2D images simplifies the point matching problem. However, differences in viewpoint and occlusion can lead to variations in the projected images, posing challenges in identifying corresponding points between scans. Additionally, differences in slicing heights lead to variations in the distribution and position of sliced points, requiring different fitting methods to estimate the centers of stems and branches.

The proposed method was validated using simulated and real tree point clouds, demonstrating its feasibility and effectiveness as an automated and marker-free registration method. This method provides a new approach to assist tree structure analysis in forestry research.
