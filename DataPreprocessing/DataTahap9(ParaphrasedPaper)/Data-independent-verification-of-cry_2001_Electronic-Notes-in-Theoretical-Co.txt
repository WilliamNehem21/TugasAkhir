The ability to model check cryptographic protocols is limited to very small implementations in terms of the number of agents, nonces, and so on. It is important to find ways to extrapolate the security of larger implementations from carefully selected smaller ones, and the use of data independence offers a potential approach to achieving this. This paper will discuss the methods and recent findings that offer generalizations in this regard.
