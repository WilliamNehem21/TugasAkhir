In the field of machine learning, optimization occurs each time a model is trained: the learning algorithm optimizes the model parameters to minimize the prediction error on the training dataset. However, hyperparameters, such as the number of layers in a neural network and the number of neurons per layer, are not optimized during training. The choice of hyperparameter values can significantly impact the quality of the final model. Data used for training machine learning models come from various sources, such as AI Challenger 2018, ImageNet, CrowdAI, PlantDisease, and Coffee Leaf, and are collected using sensors such as cameras, smartphones, and drones.

In supervised machine learning, Samajpati and Degadwala (2016) proposed a method for classifying apple fruit diseases by extracting features and colors, and using random forest classifiers for disease classification. Similarly, Omrani et al. (2014) focused on detecting three-leaf diseases (alternaria, black spot, and apple leaf miner) in apple using support vector regression based on the radial basis function. The authors compared artificial neural networks (ANN) and support vector machines (SVM) as classifiers, and found that SVM outperformed ANN. However, the data used in these studies were unbalanced.

In deep unsupervised learning, the learning process occurs without labeled data. This approach includes generation network technology, dimensionality reduction, and clustering. Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) and autoencoders are examples of deep learning models that work well on nonlinear dimensionality reduction and clustering tasks.

RBM is a generative unsupervised model that learns a probability distribution from the original dataset and infers data it has never seen before. It consists of an input layer and one or more hidden layers, and is particularly useful for system monitoring and handwritten digit recognition. Autoencoders have been utilized for predicting and classifying early and late phenomena resulting from macronutrient deficiencies in tomato plants, as well as for the detection of lead concentration in lettuce.

In the context of regression metrics, the coefficient of determination (R2) and the root mean square error (RMSE) are commonly used. The RMSE measures the standard deviation of the residuals, while the R2 represents the proportion of the variance of the dependent variable that the linear regression model explains. These metrics are calculated using specific formulas.
