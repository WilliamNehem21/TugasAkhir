The hybrid chi process algebra is designed for the modeling and analysis of hybrid systems, allowing for modular specification through a range of atomic statements and operators. In this paper, a linearization algorithm is proposed to transform a subset of the hybrid chi language into a more restricted normal form, which facilitates efficient implementation of simulators and verification of system properties. The linearization algorithm is applied to a bottle-filling line example to demonstrate the verification of chi models using tools.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 outlines the input language for the linearization algorithm, Section 3 defines the normal form output by the algorithm, Section 4 presents the algorithm itself, Section 5 offers a case study illustrating the algorithm, and Section 6 provides concluding remarks and discusses future work.

Furthermore, the paper discusses a more user-friendly syntax for core process terms, which can be used as input for the linearization algorithm. It lists additional process terms used in the bottle filling line example.

The paper also covers the description of delay using delay predicates and the any delay operator, as well as parallelism specification using the parallel composition operator. Recursion variables and their use in defining repetition are also explored. Additionally, the paper introduces the concept of local declarations within process terms.

The linearization algorithm and its application to a case study demonstrate the potential for efficient implementation and verification of hybrid systems. Although challenges in managing recursion variables in parallel compositions are acknowledged, there is ongoing work to address these issues.

Overall, the paper presents a linearization algorithm for a subset of the hybrid chi language, showcasing its application through a case study and acknowledging areas for further improvement.
