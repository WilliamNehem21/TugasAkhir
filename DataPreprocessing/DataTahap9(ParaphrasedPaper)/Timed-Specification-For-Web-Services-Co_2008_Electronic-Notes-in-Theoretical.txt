The functionalities of web services can be accessed programmatically through the web, and these functionalities are outlined in the service description using the wsdl standard language. The autonomy and heterogeneity of services can lead to various interoperability issues, which are key in service composition, particularly in coordinating component services to achieve specific objectives. Compatibility analysis plays an essential role in determining whether a client and a provider can interact effectively.

The paper discusses a model in section 2 and presents a motivating example in section 3, followed by a description of the various forms of temporal constraints in section 4. The integration of different forms of temporal constraints into web services timed transitions systems (WSTTS) is demonstrated in section 5. Section 6 explores the compatibility analysis process for web services, specifically focusing on constraints relating to data and time. Related work is discussed in section 7, and the paper concludes in section 8.

The paper defines external constraints as a tuple (p, q, d), where q represents an input/output message, p is the precondition required for q, and d is the period within which q can be executed. The external constraints can be input or output constraints depending on whether q is an input or output message, and are exposed by the client and the provider service for validation before initiating interaction. These external constraints are derived from the internal constraints outlined in section 6.2.

The management of data in an information system involves objects with attributes that can be modified through atomic operations such as add, update, and delete, with data also being readable. Constraints over counters are enforced by considering a set of data representing the counters, which can be incremented, decremented, or reset.

Two web services, q1 and q2, are considered compatible if each message sent by q1 is received by q2, and vice versa. Compatibility checking depends on the consistency of transitions corresponding to pairs of input and output messages, considering constraints over data and temporal constraints to classify transitions into three categories: absolute consistency, likely consistency, and absolute inconsistency.

The paper proposes an approach for automatically checking the compatibility of web services by taking into account their operations, messages, associated data, and conditions on this data, as well as temporal constraints. It defines internal constraints for modeling the service and infers external constraints from internal ones to identify implicit constraints indicating service incompatibility. The notion of local and global clocks, as well as data capabilities, are introduced to express activation and dependency conditions, and guards are used to specify constraints. To analyze service compatibility based on these properties, the paper suggests extending the notion of WSTTS.
