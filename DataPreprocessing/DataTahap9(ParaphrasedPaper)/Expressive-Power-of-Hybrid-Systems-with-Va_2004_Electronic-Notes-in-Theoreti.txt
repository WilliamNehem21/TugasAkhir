Frequently, the systems that one aims to represent are control systems integrated into an environment where stimuli may originate from diverse laws. For instance, sensors regulating temperature or water levels may follow non-linear evolution laws. Hybrid systems have been developed to describe similar scenarios. A hybrid system comprises a finite number of locations, variables, and transitions. In each location, variables change their values based on the elapsed time and satisfy an invariant formula at each instant. The system can transition from one location to another, labeled with a formula that specifies the values of variables triggering the transition and their new values after the transition. Several variants of this model have been explored.

A question addressed in this paper is whether the introduced classes are indeed an extension of the classical ones, and the paper establishes expressiveness results in this regard. Specifically, it is demonstrated that the class of parametric real hybrid systems is a subset of the class of polynomial real hybrid systems, while extending the class of linear real hybrid systems. It is also established that the class of polynomial real hybrid systems is the most expressive among the classical classes, but is extended by the class of d-hybrid systems. Additionally, the classes of s-hybrid systems and linear mixed hybrid systems expand the classical class of linear real hybrid systems and encompass scenarios that cannot be described by d-hybrid systems and, consequently, by polynomial real hybrid systems.

An algorithm RSA for smart cards is detailed, where an array represents the 128 bits of a key, while real variables and an integer variable serve as auxiliary variables for encryption with a public key and a secret key.

The paper also revisits and enumerates the properties of the aforementioned classes, including the notion of symbolic representation for each subclass, the semidecidability of reachability, and closure properties binding the classes of hp ar and hl.

Furthermore, the expressive power of polynomial formulae and arrays in hybrid systems is investigated. It is demonstrated that polynomial formulae provide greater expressiveness to hybrid systems, enabling them to express languages not accommodated by the hybrid systems in hl, while arrays bestow memory to hybrid systems, leading to enhanced expressive capability.

In summary, the paper delves into the nuances of hybrid systems and their expressive power, shedding light on their abilities to capture and represent complex real-world dynamics.
