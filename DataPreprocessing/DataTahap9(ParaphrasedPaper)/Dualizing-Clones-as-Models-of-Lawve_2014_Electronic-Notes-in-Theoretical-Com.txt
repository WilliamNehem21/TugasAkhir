The concept of clone theory, a significant area of research in universal algebra, focuses on studying the lattice of all clones on a specific set A. While the lattice for |A| = 2 was fully described in the 1920s by Emil L. Post, the characterization for larger cases remains an open problem. This has been the primary focus of research in the field, as evidenced by numerous publications. Bill Lawvere's introduction of what is now known as a Lawvere theory in 1963 marked a significant development in the field.

The work begins in section 3 after introducing essential notation, where an approach suggested in a previous work is followed to present a more general treatment of clones as models of Lawvere theories in arbitrary categories. The paper demonstrates the generalization of familiar concepts, such as the powerful Galois theory based on the notion of operation preserving a relation, to this broader setting, and explains the dualization of these notions. Section 4 introduces the general duality theory for clones, followed by a discussion in section 5 on the optimal application of this theory.

Sections 6 and 7 then demonstrate the practical application and benefits of this approach in studying clone lattices. In section 6, the paper provides an example by applying the duality theory to centralizer clones of distributive lattices, even those which are not necessarily finite. These clones are dualized into the category of Priestley spaces, which facilitates their study. The paper highlights that investigating the duals of centralizer clones in the category of Priestley spaces often proves to be more manageable, ultimately leading to results that are relevant to the classical case.

The paper assumes that the reader is familiar with the fundamentals of clone theory and uses basic notions from category theory. The purpose of this section is to introduce notation, the concept of algebraic structure, and the notion of duality. The paper also discusses the inclusion of nullary operations in OA and the cases where the local closure operators may be omitted, providing a link to the classical Galois theory.

The subsequent sections detail how to apply the aforementioned theory to the study of clones on sets and demonstrate the production of specific results using this approach. The paper acknowledges the challenge of finding a convenient way to dualize a clone on a set into a category, especially for finite sets. However, for finite sets, a universal method is described to obtain a scenario where the clone and a category of algebraic structures and their homomorphisms can be dually related.

A key difference between the scenario for bounded distributive lattices and that for regular distributive lattices is the change in the coproduct. For instance, in the category of Priestley spaces, the coproduct is the disjoint union, while in the category of bounded Priestley spaces, it is not, leading to consequences such as the failure of a specific proposition.

The paper also provides an example concerning coproducts in specific categories and discusses the non-deformed copowers of objects in a category. It notes that in some cases, copowers are most likely non-deformed to the degree of 1, but not always, providing natural examples of different scenarios.

Finally, the paper explores the relationship between the number of connected components in the category X and the essential arity of operations over A, emphasizing that operations over A are bounded by a finite integer if and only if X has a finite number of connected components. The paper also provides insight into the relationship between the number of idempotent elements in A and the number of connected components in X, highlighting the relevance of this relationship.
