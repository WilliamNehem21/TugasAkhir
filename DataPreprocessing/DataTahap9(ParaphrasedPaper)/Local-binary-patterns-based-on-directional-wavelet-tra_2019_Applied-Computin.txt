This academic paper discusses the challenges arising from facial image variations, such as expression and pose, which greatly increase intra-class variations and consequently affect the performance of feature extraction methods. The paper aims to address this issue by proposing a new method for facial feature extraction that utilizes interpolation-based directional wavelet transform (DIWT) and local binary patterns (LBP). The proposed method incorporates an efficient direction assessment method based on quadtree partitioning to enable adaptive direction selection in local regions of face images for obtaining DIWT sub-bands. Additionally, LBP histogram features are extracted from the selected top-level DIWT sub-bands to create a local descriptive feature set. The experimental results, conducted on the ORL, GT, and FEI databases, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to various contemporary methods, including holistic, local descriptors, and LBP-based non-adaptive multiresolution analysis methods.

To tackle expression and pose variations in face images, the paper employs DIWT and LBP to extract discriminant features in reduced space. The implementation of DIWT involves quadtree partitioning, which is a departure from the megaquad partitioning used in the standard directional wavelet transform (DIW). The resulting descriptive histogram features are subjected to linear discriminant analysis (LDA) for dimensionality reduction, and a nearest neighbor (NN) classifier is used for identification. The paper presents a detailed outline, including related methodology, the proposed facial feature extraction method, experimental results on prominent face databases, and comparisons with contemporary methods. The findings are discussed in the context of the proposed method and presented in the conclusion.

The underlying idea of DIWT is to perform lifting wavelet transform steps at various directions while maintaining multiresolution, localization, and isotropy characteristics. The DIWT retains the conventional lifting wavelet transform but incorporates modifications in the prediction and update steps, requiring only one pair of lifting steps for 2D DIWT.

To address the varying information content in different local pixel regions of face images, the paper employs quadtree partitioning to enable effective direction assignment. Each face image is divided into non-overlapping blocks using quadtree partitioning, and a direction from a direction set is selected for each block based on the minimum value of the prediction error energy. This approach ensures that all pixels within a quadtree block share the same direction.

The experimental evaluations were conducted using MATLAB 2014a on a standard computer, and three prominent face databases - ORL, Georgia Tech (GT), and FEI - were utilized. The proposed expression and pose-invariant feature extraction method was compared with various other face feature extraction methods, and the performance was assessed using cumulative match characteristic (CMC) curves. The method demonstrated superior rank-one recognition rates when compared with non-adaptive LBP-based multiresolution analysis (MRA) methods such as LGBP, LSPBPS, and CTLBP. Overall, the proposed method exhibited higher performance than holistic methods like LDA and LPP, as well as various local descriptors, for face images with varying expression and pose variations.
