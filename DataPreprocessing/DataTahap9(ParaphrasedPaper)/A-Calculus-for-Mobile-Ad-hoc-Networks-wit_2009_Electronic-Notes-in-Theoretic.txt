The primary means of communication in wireless networks is message broadcast. However, unlike in wired local area networks where broadcasted messages reach all nodes in the network, in wireless networks, broadcast is limited to the nodes within the communication range of the emitting node. In other words, while broadcast in wired networks is transitive and bidirectional, allowing indirect communication between nodes, this is not necessarily the case for wireless networks.

Our research focuses on a specific type of wireless networks, known as mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). MANETs are self-organizing and lack a centralized control structure, as well as a pre-deployed infrastructure for routing messages. A MANET forms when a group of nodes come together and agree on how to route messages for each other over possibly multiple hops.

In this paper, we introduce a static binder for location names denoted by \l, and we eliminate the previously discussed extensible binder. The introduction of this novelty means that a binding outside its scope will hide all broadcasting events carried out at \l, and connectivity involving the node at \l is restricted within the scope of the binder.

To elaborate, let's consider an infinite set of names n, an infinite set of variables x, and two disjoint finite sets, f and g, of constructor and destructor symbols. The set of terms is defined by the grammar where f is a constructor symbol with arity k. We denote the set of all terms with no variables as t.
