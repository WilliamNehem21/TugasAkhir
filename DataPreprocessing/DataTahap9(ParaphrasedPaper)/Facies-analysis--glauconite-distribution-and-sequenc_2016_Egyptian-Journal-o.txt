The Qarara formation is composed primarily of shale at its base and limestone at its top, and it dates back to the middle Eocene (Lutetian) period. Three sections situated on the eastern bank of the Nile River in El-Minya province have been assessed, characterized, and sampled. These sections, ordered from north to south, are Gebel Qarara, El-Sheikh Fadl, and Gebel El-Ahmar. The main microfacies identified in these sections include silty claystone, silty shale, fossiliferous glauconite, glauconitic (green) sand, glauconitic fossiliferous ironstone, glauconitic bioclastic wacke-packstone, and glauconitic bioclastic lime-mudstone-wackestone.

According to McRae, glauconite is formed exclusively in marine environments, and its accumulation in large quantities suggests a low sedimentation rate in normal marine salinity and weakly reducing environments. The slow formation of glauconite typically coincides with a transgression of relative sea level. The shale and claystone in the Qarara formation were deposited in a tranquil water environment. The presence of glauconite indicates a condensed setting in an overall calm environment. The carbonate microfacies were deposited in inner ramp settings due to the presence of larger foraminifera and bivalves.

The deposition of the three sections has been influenced by the initial stages of sea level rise, as evidenced by cycles and facies changes. The Gebel Qarara section was deposited under deeper conditions compared to the El-Sheikh Fadl and Gebel El-Ahmar sections, as indicated by the presence of glauconitic bioclastic lime-mudstone-wackestone microfacies. This aligns with the concept of sea transgression during the Eocene period, with the Gebel Qarara section lying to the north (i.e., deeper than the other two sections).

The shale and claystone of the Qarara formation were deposited in quiet water settings, while the presence of glauconite indicates a condensed setting in an overall calm environment. The carbonate microfacies were deposited in an inner ramp setting due to the presence of larger foraminifera and bivalve fragments.
