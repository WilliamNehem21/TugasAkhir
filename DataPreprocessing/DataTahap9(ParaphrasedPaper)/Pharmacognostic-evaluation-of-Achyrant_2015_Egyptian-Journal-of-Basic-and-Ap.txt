The study focused on analyzing the pharmacognostic characteristics of Achyranthes coynei Santapau, a perennial shrub found in India. The plant's leaves were examined for their anatomical, chemical, and medicinal properties to aid in the identification and authentication of the species. The research discovered unique features such as a thick walled epidermis, specific vascular bundles, and the presence of rosette crystals of calcium oxalate in the ground tissue. Additionally, the preliminary phytochemical screening revealed the presence of alkaloids, saponins, and triterpenoids. High-performance thin layer chromatographic (HPTLC) analysis detected the presence of eight bands in the leaf extract, which provided valuable insights into the chemical composition of the plant.

The study also highlighted the rarity of Achyranthes coynei, which has been categorized as a rare species in the Red Data Book of Indian Plants. Furthermore, the plant, known locally as "kempu uttarani" and "lal agada," has been traditionally used by folk healers for its therapeutic properties, including antibacterial and antioxidant activities. The research emphasized the importance of studying the pharmacognostic attributes of medicinal plants for proper identification, biological understanding, and therapeutic potential.

The investigation involved collecting leaf samples from the Belgaum district in Karnataka, and the authentication and deposition of the plant specimen was carried out for future reference. Analysis of total ash, acid insoluble ash, and water-soluble ash revealed the presence of inorganic and silica components in the plant sample, while water and ethanol extractive studies indicated the presence of secondary metabolites and total phenolic content responsible for antioxidant activities. The study also observed fluorescence activity in the leaf powder under ultraviolet light, indicating the presence of diverse chemical compounds.

Furthermore, the study's HPTLC analysis of triterpenoids from A. coynei leaf extract aligned with previous reports and provided evidence for the presence of oleanolic acid. The authors expressed their gratitude to the regional medical research center for providing facilities and to other contributors for their assistance during the study. Additionally, the research was supported by the Indian Council of Medical Research, New Delhi.
