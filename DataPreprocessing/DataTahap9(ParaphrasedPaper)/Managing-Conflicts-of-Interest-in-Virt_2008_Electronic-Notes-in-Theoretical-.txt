This paper introduces a formal model of virtual organizations that integrates the concept of conflicts of interest. The model is developed incrementally using event-b and focuses on abstract goals and organizations, as well as concrete resources. It is motivated by virtual organizations involved in scientific experiments, where conflicting goals at the abstract level are isolated through a separation of resources mechanism at the concrete level.

For the rapid formation of virtual organizations (VOs), potential partners need to be prepared and willing to participate in such collaborations. This readiness encompasses common infrastructure, operating rules, and representation of capabilities. The concept of a virtual breeding environment (VBE) is essential for creating virtual organizations, wherein organizations come together under a long-term cooperation agreement with common principles and infrastructure to engage in potential VOs.

The paper assumes that potential partners in a VO are selected from a VBE. It focuses on goal-oriented VOs, where participating organizations join the VBE and advertise their goals and resources, while the paper concentrates on the management of VOs.

The model of VOs presented is motivated by examples such as managing scientific experiments using large facilities, where organizations collaborate on different experiments within the same facility. The paper also explains the event-b refinement methodology used to develop the model and describes the elements of the context within the VBE, as well as the components of the VO machine capturing the lifecycle phases.

The concept of conflicts of interest within VOs is addressed, particularly the need for a separation of resources allocated to conflicting goals. The paper also highlights the lack of previous work analyzing conflicts of interest in VOs, noting related studies on dynamic coalitions without addressing conflict-of-interest dimensions.

Overall, the paper presents a formal model that captures the dynamics of VOs and conflict management, with implications for various collaborative settings.
