In this academic paper, we introduce a method for modeling biological systems using the ntcc calculus, a concurrency model that specifies systems using logical formulas as constraints. We demonstrate that the expressive power of ntcc, which encompasses partial information, concurrency, non-determinism, and timed behavior, makes it well-suited for modeling and simulating biochemical reaction networks. Building on this technique, we present Bioways, a software tool for quantitatively modeling and analyzing biological systems. We illustrate the applicability of Bioways through two examples - the glycogen breakdown pathway and the life cycle of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

We highlight the advantages of using ntcc in modeling biochemical reaction systems, as it allows us to accurately capture temporal information about interactions, temporal occurrence of events, and the relative velocities of reactions. The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the ntcc calculus, Section 3 presents Bioways with examples of the glycogen breakdown pathway and the HIV life cycle, and Section 4 concludes the paper.

In the context of the paper, agents in CCP interact with each other by exchanging information through constraints in a global store. Constraints represent partial information about the variables of the system and can be added to the store using the tell process or queried using the ask process. The ntcc calculus extends CCP by incorporating discrete time units to model timed and reactive systems. It introduces operators such as next p, !p, unless c next p, and one pi to specify timed behavior and non-determinism.

Constraints serve as an elegant mechanism for representing partial information in the system, which is especially useful when quantitative information about some components is incomplete. Additionally, in Bioways, we are able to represent the propensity (probability of occurrence) and the duration of biochemical reactions, providing an abstraction for representing the speed of chemical reactions.

We also demonstrate the application of Bioways in modeling biological phenomena, such as the dynamics of the glycogen breakdown pathway and the HIV infection cycle. By utilizing Bioways, we were able to accurately identify the necessary molecules for each step of the infection cycle and gain insights into the dynamics of biological processes.

Overall, the technique presented in this paper, based on a temporal extension of concurrent constraint programming, offers a straightforward way to represent transition times and partial information in modeling biological systems. The software tool Bioways further facilitates the modeling and analysis of biochemical interaction networks, as demonstrated through the working examples presented in this paper.

Adapted from [5, 22, 23, 27, 34], we use the lower, medium, and upper limits of the molar concentration of variables (inflim, medlim, maxlim) for each mode of simulation, as well as a model of biochemical reaction rules for the signaling pathway of glycogen breakdown.
