Cutting-edge security mechanisms are often implemented independently of one another, which restricts the types of policies that can be enforced in distributed and diverse environments. Specifically, it is challenging to enforce application-level policies that impact or utilize information from multiple distributed components. This paper introduces the concept of a security service bus (SSB), which serves as a dedicated communication channel between applications and different security mechanisms. The SSB treats security mechanisms as reusable, standalone security services that can be connected to applications and enables the enforcement of advanced policies by providing uniform access to application-level information. This results in a more adaptable and manageable security infrastructure capable of enforcing more expressive policies.

Distributed applications comprise interacting components deployed across various locations in the network. Rather than being built from scratch, applications are often created by combining diverse, reusable components. When prioritizing security, various techniques can be used to link security mechanisms to these components. The paper proceeds to illustrate the need for the SSB through a concrete example, introduces the SSB concept in detail, demonstrates how the SSB facilitates policy enforcement, and discusses related work.

The first and second policies demonstrate that a policy may require access to information not locally available at the point of enforcement. The third policy illustrates that security policies may impact multiple distributed components. Supporting such policies without further assistance is challenging, as the required information may be located in other remote components. One way to implement these policies without additional support is to make all components interoperable using a common protocol such as SOAP. Another approach is to have some components serve as proxies for the components they are connected to. 

Applications are connected to the SSB using an application binding, which acts as a wrapper component presenting an abstract view of an application to the SSB. The SSB aggregates these views and offers a uniform abstraction layer to the security services, independent of application-specific details and containing all available application-level information. The application binding implements an enforcement interface and an information interface, specifying resources contained in the application and actions that can be performed, and enabling the invocation of security services' behavior.

The paper also discusses the concept of security events and how the SSB can address certain security information flow control challenges. It explores previous work in advanced policy enforcement mechanisms and discusses how the SSB approach differs from existing approaches for sharing security information.

In summary, the paper introduces the concept of the SSB to interconnect security services and demonstrates its application to the enforcement of policies spanning multiple distributed applications. It emphasizes the general concept of an SSB rather than a fully developed architecture, with plans to design and validate a prototype of the SSB architecture.
