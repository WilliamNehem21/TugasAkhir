The kappa calculus is a formal language that abstracts molecular interactions as a specific type of graph-rewriting. Molecules are depicted as nodes with fixed numbers of sites, and molecular bonds are represented as connections between these sites. Complexes are interconnected graphs constructed from these nodes and bonds. Reactions are simulated using rewriting rules that can alter the internal state of nodes, create bonds to represent complex formations, and break bonds to represent decomplexations.

Furthermore, the paper introduces the concept of notifying molecules about the occurrence of a reaction involving other molecules within the same complex. This allows all the molecules in the involved complexes to potentially update their internal state following a reaction. The authors also discuss the process of simulating systems modeled with nano-kappa in other related works.

The paper also discusses the fields and sites of a, denoted by the integers 1, 2,..., sf(a) and 1, 2,..., ss(a), respectively. Specifically, sf(a)= 0 indicates the absence of a field, while ss(a)= 0 indicates the absence of a site.

In addition, the paper mentions that the simulator for the kappa language kasim already includes the feature of associating a pair of rates with a reaction: one for when the reactants are freely floating, and another for when they are part of the same complex. This mechanism is useful for resolving ambiguities in kappa rules between reactants a and b, which may be applied in scenarios where a and b are intermittently connected and disconnected. This addressing of the ambiguity supports the definition of kinetic rates, with volume dependency in the former case and no volume dependency in the latter. However, the introduction of physical or chemical properties that affect reaction rates as functions of the entire involved complexes makes it unfeasible to model in kappa.
