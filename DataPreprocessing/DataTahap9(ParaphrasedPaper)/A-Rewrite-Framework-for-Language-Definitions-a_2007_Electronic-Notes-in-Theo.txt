An academic paper introduces a framework for defining programming languages called k, which is based on rewrite logic semantics. It also demonstrates the translation of k language definitions into rewriting logic and into the programming language C. The paper exemplifies the framework by defining silf, a simple imperative language with functions, and testing the performance of interpreters compiled from k definitions.

The k framework is a rewrite logic-based approach for specifying programming languages, consisting of the k-notation, which employs domain-specific syntactic-sugar conventions to enhance readability, and the k-technique, based on a first-order representation of continuations. Ongoing research involves the development of tools around k to aid in defining and analyzing programming languages.

The paper provides insights into the semantics of a simple programming language with functions defined using k, as well as details of a translation from the k-notation to an interpreter in C. The k-framework is described in detail, highlighting the k-notation and the k-technique as essential components.

The paper also discusses context transformers in the k notation, emphasizing their role in compactness and modularity of language definitions. Additionally, it explains a rule for applying functions in the defined language, illustrating the conventions discussed within the paper.

The paper introduces a strategy for automatically deriving interpreters from definitions of language semantics, and outlines future work, including the improvement of the k framework, the generation of interpreters from k definitions, and the definition of syntax and semantics for automatic generation of language parsers and other static tools.

It notes that arithmetic, relational, and logical operations in the defined language do not implement short-circuit evaluation but explains a potential approach to enable short-circuit behavior for these operations.
