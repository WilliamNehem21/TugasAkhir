The majority of large software systems are designed with distributed components to manage complexity and handle concurrent execution of threads. However, there is a lack of a comprehensive semantic model that can effectively handle distributed concurrent components and also serve as a basis for existing component technologies. This paper addresses this gap by introducing an operational semantics for distributed concurrent component-based systems. It also presents modeling techniques based on Unified Modeling Language (UML) and provides tool support for modeling, code generation, and system execution.

Software engineers face increasing complexity in software systems, and the reliability of these systems is crucial. However, there is a high level of uncertainty in software development, with more than 70% of development projects ending unsuccessfully.

To implement software systems with distributed concurrent components, object-oriented programming languages like Java or C++ are commonly used. While these languages offer basic constructs for concurrent programs, higher-level abstractions are needed to effectively develop large-scale distributed and concurrent systems. Component technologies like CORBA, J2EE, and .NET are often used to handle distribution and network communication, providing a component model and remote method call capabilities.

Before programming begins, various specification artifacts are created to model the system under development, primarily focusing on the component structure using languages like UML, which provides diagrams for both static and dynamic behavior. In order to integrate and refine these models towards implementation, a clear semantic model of the relationship between concurrent control flow and component structure is needed.

Several approaches have been developed to extend UML and provide a precise semantics for distributed and parallel systems, but they are based on active objects, where each concurrently executed thread belongs exclusively to a single object. The paper proposes an alternative approach that takes into account concurrent threads moving between different components or objects.

The paper is organized as follows: it presents a simple program to illustrate the behavioral aspects of distributed concurrent component-based systems, followed by the elaboration of an operational semantics for these systems. It then demonstrates how such systems can be modeled using UML and introduces the tool environment for modeling, code generation, and system execution. The paper concludes by highlighting the potential of the proposed operational semantics to support dynamically changing structures in distributed concurrent component-based systems.

The proposed operational semantics provides a reliable foundation for describing and implementing distributed concurrent components, serving as an abstraction of existing programming models such as CORBA, J2EE, and .NET. The paper assumes an observation synchronous model to maintain simplicity and generality, which ensures a global order of all observation points and method calls and returns.

The operational semantics can detect possible inconsistencies caused by concurrent thread execution and verify the system's consistency predicates. It can also be implemented using existing component environments like CORBA, J2EE, and .NET, and it supports the modeling of system behavior using UML activity diagrams.

In addition to the formal semantics, the paper introduces a tool called DesignIt, which enables software engineers to model and develop component-based software systems using UML-based techniques. The tool also supports code generation and system execution, using XSLT transformations to generate Java program code from XML files.

The paper also describes a distributed execution and debugging environment implemented using CORBA, allowing asynchronous messages or method calls to be initiated from outside the system. The debugging environment can execute and analyze the system step by step, stopping the execution when inconsistencies are detected. The paper emphasizes the importance of developing and maintaining distributed concurrent component-based software systems, and it calls for further improvements in tool support and reasoning about system specifications.

Overall, the paper presents an operational semantics for distributed concurrent component-based systems, along with modeling techniques and tool support for system development and execution. It highlights the significance of addressing the horizontal concurrent execution flow in software systems and provides a foundation for future research and development in this area.
