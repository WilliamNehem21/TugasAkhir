In the field of geology and stratigraphic sedimentology, it is recognized that there exists a significant correlation between seismic signals emitted by adjacent reflection elements. This correlation can be leveraged as prior knowledge to impose constraints on seismic facies classification, thereby enhancing the lateral continuity of seismic facies maps and improving the algorithmâ€™s robustness. Throughout the formation's sedimentary evolution, anomalous bodies, such as karst caves and faults, are often formed. Consequently, the relationship between adjacent reflection elements cannot be accurately represented by a rigid division. To address this, we established a probabilistic model to capture this correlation and integrated it into the loss function of the Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) algorithm, utilizing cross-entropy as a distance measure. As a result, we proposed a novel method for analyzing seismic facies.

The process of computing membership, a fundamental step in FCM, is an iterative one that involves updating cluster centers in each iteration (as depicted in algorithm 1). The standard FCM method updates cluster centers based on the influence of all the data, regardless of the extent to which the data is affected by noise. In contrast, the FCM with Cross-Entropy Constraint (FCM-CEC) method considers the constraints arising from the lateral continuity of the formation. As a result, data less affected by noise tends to have higher soft probability values at the start of the algorithm iterations, which increases the likelihood of being classified into the same category as adjacent reflectors and playing a more significant role in subsequent iterations. Conversely, the impact of noisy data diminishes as the iterative process unfolds. We posit that the FCM-CEC method's ability to afford better results is due to its focus on allowing more reliable samples to exert a stronger influence in the clustering process.

Conventional seismic facies analysis techniques often neglect the correlation between adjacent seismic gathers, resulting in seismic facies with inadequate lateral continuity. In contrast, our proposed FCM-CEC method incorporates a probabilistic model to capture the correlation of adjacent formation reflectors and introduces the lateral continuity of strata as prior information to guide the partitioning of seismic reflection elements. Experiments conducted on synthetic and real seismic data have validated the efficacy of our method. The seismic facies maps generated using the FCM-CEC method exhibit improved consistency within geological formations and lower uncertainty at the boundaries. Furthermore, this approach enables the extraction of additional information related to the lithologic characteristics of interest.
