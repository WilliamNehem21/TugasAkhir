The quantity of hops between the source and destination nodes is an important factor in the analytical study of multi-hop ad hoc networks. To our knowledge, there is little analytical work that examines the hop count of paths in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) in a random mobility environment. In this paper, we present a theoretical investigation into the expected number of hops between any randomly selected source-destination pair in multi-hop ad hoc networks, where nodes move according to the random waypoint mobility model. We analyze the effects of network parameters such as node density, network area size, and node transmission range. Additionally, we conduct simulation experiments for various network parameters to validate our proposed analytical approach.

Numerous studies have been published on the impact of hop count on the performance of MANETs. For example, Li et al. explored the effect of different traffic patterns on per node throughput scalability, while Gamal et al. introduced a scheme to analyze the trade-off between delay and throughput in fixed and mobile ad hoc networks based on parameters such as transmission range, node mobility, and number of hops.

Previous work has also examined the trade-off between flooding cost and search latency for target location discovery, but these studies assumed uniformly distributed distances between source and destination nodes, neglecting the impact of network area size. A mathematical model for the expected number of hops based on a Poisson randomly distributed network has been presented, but these studies assumed stationary nodes with uniform or exponential distribution over the network area.

Mobility models such as random waypoint, random walk, free way, and Manhattan play a crucial role in simulating mobile ad hoc networks. To the best of our knowledge, there is no analytical work that computes the expected hop count of paths in MANETs in a random mobility environment. This deficiency motivates our work, in which we develop a simple analytical approach to estimate the expected number of hops between any source-destination pair in MANETs where nodes are distributed in a square area and move according to the random waypoint mobility model. We use the random waypoint mobility model as it is one of the most commonly used mobility models in MANET studies, and note that the proposed approach can be used to investigate the hop count of paths for other mobility models as well.

In order to calculate the average number of hops analytically using the maximum hop distance (MHD) without the need for time-consuming simulations, we derive the probability density function of the distance between the source (or a relay node) and its neighboring nodes using geometric probability. We then use this function to compute the expected value for the maximum forward distance toward the destination, which is essential for computing the expected value for the remaining distance to the destination. By recursively computing the remaining distance to the destination, we can compute the expected hop counts.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we derive an expression for the expected Euclidean distance between any random source and destination nodes moving according to RWPMM. Theoretical analysis of per hop progress and hop count is presented in Section 3. In Section 4, the proposed approach is validated via simulation. Finally, the paper is concluded in Section 5.

In summary, our work addresses the lack of analytical examination of hop counts in MANETs in random mobility environments. We develop a simple closed form analytical approach to estimate the expected number of hops between any source-destination pair, which is validated through simulation experiments for various network parameters. Compared to existing methods, the accuracy of our proposed approach is much improved.
