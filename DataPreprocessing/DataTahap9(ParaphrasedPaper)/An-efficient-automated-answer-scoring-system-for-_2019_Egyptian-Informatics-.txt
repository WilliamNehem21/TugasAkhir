The reliability of manual grading is not guaranteed, whereas automated scoring offers a consistent and fair evaluation process that can be repeated multiple times. This interdisciplinary research has the potential to open up new avenues for researchers, particularly if such a system is developed for Indian languages, which could pave the way for similar applications in other Indian languages. While English automated scoring systems have shown limited success, challenges continue to persist in the field of artificial intelligence and natural language processing. Automated scoring systems integrate various techniques such as natural language processing (NLP), linguistics, machine learning, statistics, and web technologies. Current automatic essay grading mechanisms rely on machine learning techniques and grammatical measures of quality, but they do not effectively capture the meaning of the text and hence are inadequate for assessing the content of answers.

The paper reviews and compares various natural language processing (NLP) based approaches to automated answer scoring, emphasizing the importance of semantic similarity in NLP, information retrieval, text mining, QA systems, and related areas. Several studies are discussed that propose different approaches to automated essay scoring, including supervised and unsupervised learning models, semantic information extraction, question answering technology, and tackling ambiguity in semantic question answering systems. These studies explore the application of NLP techniques such as semantic information extraction, statistical language modeling, and semantic embedding spaces in question answering systems. Furthermore, they highlight the use of disambiguation solutions and matching parse thickets for open domain question answering. Additionally, the studies discuss the application of network automated essay scoring systems and vector regression for evaluating essays.

In conclusion, this paper provides an overview of the current landscape of automated scoring systems and their applications, as well as the challenges and potential future directions for research in this area.
