This paper introduces approximation preserving reductions from the budgeted and generalized maximum coverage problems to the knapsack problem with conflict graphs. These reductions are utilized to derive polynomial time approximation schemes for specific instances of these problems. The paper also demonstrates the existence of pseudo-polynomial algorithms, particularly in cases with polynomial time complexity, and analyzes the characteristics of instances for which these algorithms are applicable.

While the existence of a PTAS or pseudo-polynomial algorithms for the mentioned problems is improbable (unless P = NP), the paper establishes the existence of such algorithms for special cases of the problems and outlines the necessary and sufficient conditions to identify subsets of these instances.

The subsequent sections detail the polynomial time approximation preserving reductions from BMC and GMC to the Knapsack problem with conflict graphs (KCG), and establish that they yield approximation algorithms for restricted versions of these problems (Section 2). Section 3 delineates the characteristics of subsets of BMC and GMC instances that satisfy the conditions of the algorithms. Section 4 describes exact algorithms derived from the approximations for specific cases, and, finally, Section 5 presents conclusions and outlines future research directions.

The paper also discusses the characteristics of BMC instances that correspond to KCG instances with weakly chordal conflict graphs, illustrating that vertices in V3 form part of an anti-hole. Proposition 2.3 affirms the existence of an approximation algorithm for BMC when the corresponding KCG instance is weakly chordal or has bounded treewidth, and the subsequent section defines the characteristics of BMC instances that have corresponding instances of KCG with these properties.

The PTAS obtained from the reduction in Section 2 can be employed to create a pseudo-polynomial time algorithm for a restriction of BMC, specifically for instances with corresponding KCG instances featuring weakly chordal or bounded treewidth graphs, as per Proposition 4.1.

Furthermore, the paper asserts that if the weights of the elements in a BMC instance are bounded by a constant independent of the instance, the algorithm from Proposition 2.3 can be used to produce a polynomial time algorithm for that restriction of BMC, as shown in Proposition 4.2. This case has practical applications, such as for the time-aware test-case prioritization problem where the weights are unitary.
