The study found that the muscle of the Chanodichthys erythropterus, a type of small-sized cyprinid fish found in East Asia, contains a high concentration of essential amino acids, with ten of the most essential amino acids present. The muscle also has a high proportion of stearic acid, a saturated fatty acid, and oleic acid as the main monounsaturated fatty acid, with alpha-linolenic acid being the dominant polyunsaturated fatty acid. The ratio of n3/n6 fatty acids was found to be 2.82, indicating that the meat of this species is well-suited for nutritional purposes. These results suggest that Chanodichthys erythropterus muscle is a valuable food source with high-quality protein and well-balanced amino acids, which could promote good health and aid in the prevention and healing of diseases in the human body.

Chanodichthys erythropterus is a predatory carp belonging to the family Cyprinidae, and it is widely distributed in East Asia, ranging from the Amur River south to Taiwan and the Red River, as well as Lake Buir in Mongolia. It is an important commercial freshwater fish in China, and it reaches up to 102 cm in length and 9 kg in weight. The Dianshan Lake in China, where this species is captured, is home to a variety of fish species, with members of the Cyprinidae family being dominant and preferred by the local population as a food source. Given the increasing interest in consuming fish for its nutritional qualities, it is important to study the nutrient composition of Chanodichthys erythropterus to understand its nutritional value.

Although the nutritional quality of fishery products has been extensively studied, there has been no specific research focusing on the chemical composition of Chanodichthys erythropterus. This study aims to fill this gap by providing essential information about the nutrient qualities of this species, which will benefit both consumers and the scientific community. The study specifically analyzed the proximate composition, fatty acid compositions, and amino acid compositions of Chanodichthys erythropterus captured from Lake Dianshan in China, where it is one of the main commercial fish species native to the region.

Lake Dianshan, located between Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Kunshan of Jiangsu Province in China, covers a total area of 63.7 square kilometers with an average depth of 2.5 m, and the deepest recorded depth of 6.39 m. The lake supports a thriving fishery industry in Shanghai, making it an important source of commercially valuable fish species.
