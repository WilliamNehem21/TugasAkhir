Verification is closely associated with logics and is currently a widely accepted and active area of research within computer science. The use of logical formulas to express properties allows for the verification of correctness. Determining whether a piece of hardware or software satisfies a specific correctness property often boils down to solving the satisfiability or model checking problem for a temporal logic.

In both scenarios, games offer an advantageous approach to conducting the verification process. A game-based algorithm that addresses these problems calculates a winning strategy for a player in a two-player game. This strategy can not only inform the user of a verification tool whether the examined formula is satisfied or satisfiable, but also demonstrate the reason behind this conclusion. This is achieved by allowing the user to play against the winning strategy, with the user inevitably losing any resulting play due to the rules of the game closely following the semantics of the formulas, providing insight into where a transition system fails to satisfy the formula.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 revisits the definition of LTL. Section 3 provides a brief summary and discussion of focus games for the satisfiability of LTL formulas. Section 4 introduces focus games for this problem, demonstrates their correctness, outlines an algorithm for determining their winners, and explains how to utilize their winning strategies in focus games. Finally, Section 5 defines model checking focus games for LTL.

As a result, the scope of the evidence becomes increasingly narrow until it ultimately reduces to a proposition or retains an "r" or its unfoldings. In the former case, the play is won by player E with her winning condition (i). In the latter case, the "r" will receive a focus index and retain it, according to a variant of lemma 4.4. Consequently, the play will be won by player E with her winning condition (ii). Overall, player E has a winning strategy.
