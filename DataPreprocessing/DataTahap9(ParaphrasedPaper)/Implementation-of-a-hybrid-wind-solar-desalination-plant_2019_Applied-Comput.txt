Desalination is a crucial water resource, particularly in Gulf countries such as Saudi Arabia. To ensure sustainable and localized water generation, it is imperative to transition to or incorporate renewable technologies into traditional power grids to drive desalination plants. In addition, there is a shift towards a cyber-physical system (CPS) approach for controlling these grids, as opposed to conventional process control methods. This paper demonstrates how renewable-based desalination plants can be controlled and monitored using the Internet of Things (IoT), which falls within the framework of CPS. The study focuses on a hybrid wind-solar energy driven desalination plant implemented from an IoT perspective using Cisco's Packet Tracer network simulation tool. The plant is powered by renewable sources, which operate the pumping station, and employs automatic control systems for the motors and boiler. Furthermore, it features a web-accessible monitoring station housed on a server with varying levels of access for employees based on their roles. Network security is maintained through the use of Network Address Translation (NAT) and Access Control Lists (ACL).

With current attention on renewable energy and concerns regarding the sustainability of fossil fuels, renewable sources are being prioritized for powering desalination plants. Moreover, as desalination plants are typically situated along coastlines, they can benefit from the abundant wind energy available in these areas. In Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia, the year-round availability of sunlight presents a significant opportunity for powering industrial operations through hybrid wind-solar energy. However, these nations are lagging behind in the adoption of renewable technologies, though Saudi Arabia has recently initiated work on a plant utilizing such technology.

While existing literature extensively covers the use of renewable sources for generating energy in desalination plants, these analyses have mainly focused on the physical/chemical processes, engineering, and financial aspects. However, there has been a lack of analysis or simulation from the perspective of IoT, which is crucial as renewable energies are integral to smart grids falling under the domain of CPS.

This paper demonstrates the implementation of a small-scale desalination plant using the IoT framework in Cisco Packet Tracer. The subsequent sections provide a review of previous work on renewable energy-driven desalination plants, describe the implementation logic of the hybrid wind-solar desalination plant, present the results, and conclude the paper.

Relevant economic analyses have been carried out by several researchers, demonstrating the feasibility and cost reductions associated with small desalination plants powered by renewable sources. Additionally, studies have shown the significance of favorable locations and appropriate crop selection for plants catering to local agricultural needs. Other research has also revealed that under certain conditions, solar power can significantly reduce the cost of producing drinking water. Furthermore, innovative models combining desalination and renewable energy for optimal power and water supply have been proposed, indicating potential benefits in terms of cost and efficiency.

Recent research for Saudi Arabia has proposed a hybrid wind-solar system that is expected to support a 1kW load all year round. While this model is similar to the one implemented in this study, the current focus lies on the IoT aspect of the plants rather than the mechanical or electrical aspects. It is hoped that this model can be implemented on a larger scale in the near future.
