In this paper, we present and investigate strongly semicontinuous lattices, which constitute a novel category of complete lattices positioned between semicontinuous lattices and continuous lattices. We demonstrate that a complete lattice L is strongly semicontinuous if and only if L is both semicontinuous and meet semicontinuous. We establish certain versions of strong interpolation properties for the semiway-below relation in (strongly) semicontinuous lattices. Moreover, we provide characterization theorems involving distributivity and approximate identities for strongly semicontinuous lattices, indicating that these lattices share similar properties with continuous lattices. Additionally, we craft a subtle counterexample to illustrate that semicontinuous lattices may not necessarily be strongly semicontinuous lattices.
