The primary focus of this research paper is on data aggregation in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) using a cluster-based approach. The cluster head is responsible for aggregating data from various sensor nodes within the cluster and transmitting the aggregated data to the sink node. Due to the limited battery power of sensor nodes, periodic data transmission to the sink node is challenging, making the use of data aggregation techniques crucial for preserving the energy of sensor nodes. The paper also discusses the importance of periodic data aggregation in applications such as emergency monitoring and defense forces, highlighting the need for efficient and timely data collection.

To address the challenges associated with periodic data aggregation, the authors propose a conflict-free periodic data aggregation technique called CPDA, which aims to support high data rates and heterogeneous WSNs. The proposed technique is analyzed mathematically, and the paper outlines the related work, the proposed periodic data aggregation technique, scheduling policies in heterogeneous environments, problem formulation, simulation results and analysis, and concludes with future research directions.

The authors also introduce the concept of parent and child nodes in WSNs, emphasizing the importance of conflict avoidance for ensuring efficient data collection. The simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the CPDA technique compared to existing approaches, especially in scenarios involving low battery power sensor nodes.

In conclusion, the authors suggest future research to develop a priority-based periodic data aggregation technique for WSNs.
