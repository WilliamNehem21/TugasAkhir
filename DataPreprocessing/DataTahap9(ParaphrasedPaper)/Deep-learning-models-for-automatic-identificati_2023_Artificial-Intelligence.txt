A study was conducted to evaluate the performance of deep learning models in classifying plant-parasitic nematodes commonly found in Indonesian soil. The research aimed to compare the effectiveness of four state-of-the-art deep learning models (ResNet101v2, CoAtNet-0, EfficientNetV2b0, and EfficientNetV2m) trained on a nematodes dataset and determine the impact of data augmentation on model accuracy. The study involved training the models on a dataset of 957 nematode samples across 11 classifications, with augmentation processes applied to the training set. The models were evaluated using a split of the dataset into training, validation, and test sets, with varying results observed based on different model-optimizer-augmentation combinations.

The study found that the highest accuracy of 93.81% was achieved without any augmentation using the SGD optimizer, while using the RMSprop optimizer resulted in the lowest accuracy of 18.56% across all model combinations. The EfficientNetV2b0 and EfficientNetV2m models with the RMSprop optimizer and brightness augmentation achieved the best test accuracy of 97.94%. Additionally, it was observed that the CoatNet family demonstrated higher generalization capability towards augmented data compared to other model families.

However, results showed that not all types of augmentation led to increased model performance. Contrast augmentation resulted in decreased accuracy for most models, indicating that excessive contrast adjustment could lead to contextually incorrect nematode images, ultimately hindering model learning. On the other hand, blurring augmentation with Gaussian blur had a positive effect on certain model-optimizer combinations, providing the variations needed for the model to study the features of the target class nematodes.

The findings from this research emphasize the importance of selecting appropriate augmentation techniques to effectively improve model performance. While the study demonstrated the potential of deep learning models in identifying plant-parasitic nematodes with high accuracy, it also highlighted the need for further research to account for diverse conditions and scenarios beyond the limitations of the current dataset. In conclusion, the study's proposed approach holds promise for the rapid and reliable identification of plant-parasitic nematodes, with future research aimed at addressing potential system limitations and expanding the applicability of the model to real-world conditions.
