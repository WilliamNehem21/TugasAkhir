The decision problem was only examined for specific values of k and l in the academic paper. Despite this limitation, the issue of determining whether a graph is t-admissible was explored for (0, 2) and (1, 1)-graphs, which are 3-admissible. Our contributions for msst(k, l)-graphs are presented in Table 2. Although most of these problems were identified as NP-complete (refer to Section 3.1), we provide subclasses for which msst is admissible. Additionally, in this study, we characterize 2-admissible (0, 2)-graphs. In this context, h is defined as g[vh], where vh represents the set of vertices incident to each transversal edge of g, i.e., edges with one end in k1 and the other in k2.

For a graph without cycles, a chordal graph is a (2, 0)-graph if and only if it is a forest. Therefore, a (2, 1)-chordal graph is divided into a forest f and a clique k. Within an arbitrary graph g, given an (f, k)-partition, the edges with one end in f and the other in k are referred to as transversal edges. When two transversal edges are incident to the same tree in f, they create a cycle in g. If the two edges are incident to the same vertex of k, a type 1 cycle is formed; otherwise, a type 2 cycle is formed. In particular, if g is chordal, in a type 1 cycle, the vertex in k must be adjacent to every other vertex of the cycle. In a type 2 cycle, there are two possibilities: at least one of the k-vertices is completely adjacent to the cycle vertices, or their neighborhoods cover the cycle with some intersection, as described elsewhere. In this study, we consider the vertices v.

A bi-star b is formed by connecting one leaf of a star with the center of another star. A v, w-centered bi-star is a bi-star with centers v and w. The leaf sets of v and w in b are denoted as l(v) and l(w), respectively.
