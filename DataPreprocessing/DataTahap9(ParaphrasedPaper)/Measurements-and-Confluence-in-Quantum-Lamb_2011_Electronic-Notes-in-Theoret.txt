In contrast to classical mechanics, where measurements provide the value of an observable along with an associated error, measurements in quantum mechanics have a fundamentally probabilistic nature. This means that a quantum measurement can yield a certain number of results, each with a finite probability. Furthermore, the act of measurement irreversibly alters the state of the system, leading to behavior that is counterintuitive but crucial in the context of quantum information processing.

Additionally, a comprehensive understanding of measurement is vital for preventing misinterpretations of quantum computation as a whole, such as the misconception that quantum computation inherently leads to an exponential increase in complexity. To comprehend the potential and limitations of quantum computation, it is essential to formalize measurement in an elegant manner. It is worth noting that while the paper discusses projective measurement as one approach, it is not the sole possibility for a quantum measurement; however, it is one of the simplest. Furthermore, any quantum measurement can be reproduced using a unitary mapping and a projective measurement.
