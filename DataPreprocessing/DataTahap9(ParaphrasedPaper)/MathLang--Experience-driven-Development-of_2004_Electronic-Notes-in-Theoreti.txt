The management of data has become increasingly vital for automation, with computers and appropriate software greatly aiding in tasks such as editing, storage, publishing, data retrieval, and other computations. This has raised the question of whether computers can provide similar assistance throughout the entire process of mathematical work, from inception to the creation of a treatise.

To address the automation of computations for data encoded in mathematical language, a language called mathlang has been devised, utilizing symbolic representations for every element of the language to facilitate computer manipulations.

When utilizing existing formal languages for mathematical writing, it is essential to ensure that the mathematics employed conforms to the underlying logic of the language. To address the limitations in expressivity resulting from this constraint, mathlang has been designed to describe the structure of mathematical texts and their reasoning steps to cover all areas of mathematics. The languages MV and WTT are expected to provide a new language to encode mathematics at every level of mathematical work, thereby enabling mathematicians to utilize computers as a support tool from the outset. To test the feasibility of using these languages, they were employed to encode the foundations of analysis (e.g., Landau) which has already been fully formalized in Automath by Bert van Benthem Jutting.

Extensions were made to the WTT language to encode the first chapter while remaining faithful to language constructions such as flags, definitions by cases, blocks, and references. The endeavor to encode mathematical texts using mathlang is still in its developmental stage, and the presented mathlang texts are rendered with an experimental syntax, which is expected to undergo further refinements. 

Mathlang possesses certain rules and constructions, such as declarations for new variables, definitions by cases, and blocks, which aim to maintain proximity to the original mathematical text and enable the formalization process. Moreover, a type checker has been implemented to verify the typing of mathlang documents by applying the rules of the type system.

Continued development and refinement of mathlang are necessary to incorporate references in the mathlang syntax and to implement new constructions for utilizing the notion of blocks to derive information within the language. Additionally, the implementation of mathlang should be guided by existing mathematical texts and practice, with a focus on preserving the language's metatheory and faithful implementation.

It is also envisaged that a specific editor will be necessary as the language further evolves to encode mathematical texts fully, featuring a user-friendly interface and an integrated checker capable of providing instantaneous feedback on the type analysis of the text. The incorporation of a grammatical analyzer that extends its own grammatical rules on the fly is also proposed.
