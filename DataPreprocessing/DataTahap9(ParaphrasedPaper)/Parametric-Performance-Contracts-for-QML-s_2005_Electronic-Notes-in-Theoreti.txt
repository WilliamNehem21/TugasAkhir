The paper introduced a concept of parametric performance contracts, which aims to model the performance of offered services of a component based on the performance of external services. The time consumption of external services and internal computations of the component is described using random variables with continuous distribution functions. However, this approach faced challenges related to compositionality, simplicity of expression of distributed functions, and complexity of presentation.

The concept of compositionality refers to the ability to use the result of evaluating a parametric contract as an input for other parametric contracts, enabling the chaining of evaluations and connecting components as part of an assembly. The use of continuous distribution functions did not always ensure that the result of the parametric contract belonged to the same class of distribution functions.

The resulting distribution functions for parametric contracts were complex, leading to limited expressiveness. While approximations with appropriate statistical distributions could address the complexity and lack of compositionality, they would reduce the precision of performance predictions.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces component contracts and the concept of parametric contracts, along with the Quality of Service Modelling Language (QML) and its discrete probability distributions. Section 3 discusses dependency models and defines parametric performance contracts, while Section 4 explores related work. Finally, Section 5 concludes and presents open issues.

To model the dependency between contextual quality attributes and component quality attributes, service effect automata needed to be extended. An extension to Markov models was described for predicting the reliability of component services. Section 3 also presents an extension for linear performance metrics, such as response or reaction time.

The paper mentions that QML can be used to specify Quality of Service (QoS) contracts for component interfaces, and introduces a variant called CQML for component-oriented QoS. However, the compositional reasoning in CQML was deemed to be immature.

The paper also describes the extension of service effect automata to parametric contracts for performance, with each transition and node annotated with a random variable to model time consumption. Although using mean and variance of computation times would simplify mathematical analysis, it would limit the model to the Gaussian distribution of service times, which is not symmetric.

The paper raised concerns about the computational complexity of discrete functions with a large number of sampling points, where the number of sampling points increases with the size of the domain and the accuracy of the sampling.

The discussion also touched on the application of the discrete Fourier transform for the probability mass function of each state and external service of the service effect automaton, with further computations performed on the Fourier transforms and the inverse Fourier transform applied on the result.

In summary, the paper discusses an extension of parametric contracts under performance aspects, using discrete distribution functions to model the time consumption of external service calls. The model is parametric and compositional, and the precision of the computations depends on the chosen step width of the QML specification.
