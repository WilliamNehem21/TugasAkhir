In summary, the remainder of the review is organized into different sections, starting with common data sources used in pharmacovigilance. It then explores informatics methods based on data mining techniques used for quantitative PV signal detection by regulatory bodies and categories of ML algorithms deployed in DDI prediction. The review concludes with an outline of limitations and recommendations for future research.

Signal detection and data sources:
The review discusses the development of spontaneous reporting systems (SRSs) to enable continuous monitoring of pharmaceutical and biological products within pharmacovigilance systems. The structure of SRSs adheres to international safety reporting guidance issued by the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH E2B) and the proprietary company safety databases containing individual case safety reports (ICSRs) of pharmaceutical products. These data sources are important for establishing causality assessment and developing mining/ML models, despite their limitations.

DDI prediction and informatics methods:
The review explains the principles of multiplicative and additive models for DDI prediction and discusses the use of text mining and natural language processing to mine unstructured data sources for adverse DDI signals. It also highlights a specific approach developed by Jon D. Duke et al. to mine mechanistic features from PV literature abstracts to predict potential DDI signals.

ML algorithms in pharmacovigilance:
The review delves into the real-world applications of support vector machines (SVM) and unsupervised ML techniques such as clustering and biclustering in pharmacovigilance. It also discusses the use of network-based ML approaches and the merits and limitations of naive Bayes modeling in pharmacovigilance.

Challenges and future directions:
The review addresses the limitations of supervised ML and the need for advancements in incorporating unsupervised ML approaches in DDI discovery studies. It also outlines future directions such as boosting DDI signal detection from SRS data, using multiple data sources, and assessing ML algorithmic performance.

Advancements in informatics techniques:
The review highlights the exponential increase in scientific literature and the applicability of informatics-based methods, particularly text mining and ML frameworks, in exploring biomedical corpora for the detection and analysis of DDI signals.

Conclusions and implications:
The review emphasizes the advancements in informatics techniques and the importance of developing better predictive methods for detecting potential DDI signals. It also highlights the challenges in DDI signal detection studies and the need for well-established guidances for assessing informatics-driven methods performance.

Overall, the review offers insights into the developments in informatics techniques for DDI signal detection and emphasizes the importance of evolving surveillance practices in pharmacovigilance using different prospective methods.
