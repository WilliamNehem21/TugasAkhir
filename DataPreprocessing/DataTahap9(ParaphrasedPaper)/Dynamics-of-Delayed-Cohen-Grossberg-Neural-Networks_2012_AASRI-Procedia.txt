This study explores the dynamics of Cohen-Grossberg neural networks with mixed delays. The researchers developed new lyapunov-krasovkii functionals to establish sufficient conditions for uniformly ultimate boundedness, the presence of an attractor, and globally exponential stability. These conditions are expressed using LMIs, which are more flexible than algebraic formulations and can be easily verified using the LMI toolbox in MATLAB. The research was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.11101053), the Key Project of the Chinese Ministry of Education (No.211118), the Excellent Youth Foundation of the Educational Committee of Hunan Provincial (No.10b002), and the Science and Technology Project of Hunan of China (No. 2010fk3025, No. 2012sk3096).
