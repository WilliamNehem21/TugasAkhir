The study examined the impact of glycyrrhizin (GL) and omega-3 (U-3) on liver inflammation and fibrosis in rats induced with thioacetamide (TAA), a model for liver fibrosis. Male Wistar rats were divided into five groups: a control group and four groups treated with TAA, including a TAA group, a GL group (treated with GL orally), and a U-3 group (treated with U-3 orally).

Chronic liver diseases are a growing concern in developed countries, and they often lead to liver fibrosis, characterized by the accumulation of scar tissue due to chronic injury. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are bioactive compounds found in marine sources and have been reported to be beneficial in hepatic injury and steatosis.

The study induced liver fibrosis in rats using TAA and assessed the effects of GL and U-3 on liver inflammation and fibrosis. Results showed that TAA caused oxidative stress, as indicated by an increase in hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, while GL and U-3 reduced MDA levels, indicating a decrease in oxidative stress.

The study also found that GL and U-3 prevented an increase in NF-kB levels, which in turn prevented the development of liver fibrosis and inflammation. Additionally, there was a positive correlation between liver NF-kB levels and lipid peroxidation, suggesting that oxidative stress plays a role in liver inflammation and fibrosis.

In conclusion, the study demonstrated the potential anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic, and antioxidant effects of GL and U-3 in preventing liver fibrosis induced by TAA in rats. The findings suggest that GL and U-3 may have hepatoprotective effects and could be explored further in clinical studies as potential nutrients to protect against liver fibrosis.
