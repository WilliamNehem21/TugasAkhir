The concept of a flexible dependence relation is discussed in the paper, where it is mentioned that additional knowledge about the types of programs being verified can lead to the removal of certain dependencies in the programming language. For instance, the paper explains that while Java generally supports shared memory, if the programs being verified do not use shared memory, then this dependency can be removed. It is also highlighted that having the dependence relation as an explicit parameter of the partial order reduction module not only enhances the generality of the method but also allows the tool builder to customize it based on the input programs.

The paper outlines several existing heuristics for computing ample(s) and provides a set of conditions that, if met by ample(s), ensure a correct reduction of the given state transition system. Additionally, a special case of the conditions used in the paper is presented in section 3.3.

In order to design a general partial order reduction module for semantic definitions of concurrent programming languages, the paper discusses the need for making basic assumptions about these semantic definitions. These assumptions are deemed reasonable and do not impose practical limitations on the class of semantic definitions that can be dealt with. The paper also enumerates these assumptions, detailing the interface between the semantic definition module and the partial order reduction module.

Furthermore, the paper describes the implementation of the partial order reduction, including an operation called markamples, which computes the ample set for the current state and returns the state with the ample transitions marked as per the partial order reduction algorithm. The paper also discusses the addition of information about context in transition tuples to help resolve dependencies and enable better reduction.

The most intricate part of the partial order reduction algorithm is noted to be checking the conditions for a candidate set of transitions. The paper further details the verification process for these conditions and discusses how they are checked for a candidate set of transitions (ample set).

Additionally, the paper presents a method to make software model checkers with partial order reduction capabilities language-independent by transforming the rewriting logic formal semantics of a given language. It is emphasized that the language specialization can be carried out semi-automatically and with relatively little effort by a tool builder, with scope for incorporating language-specific optimizations.

The prototype implementation of the method is acknowledged not to support certain optimization strategies, but the paper suggests that many of these strategies can be integrated into the framework. It is also mentioned that a more extensive experimentation with a broader set of language instantiations and the inclusion of optimizations should be conducted in the future. Moreover, the paper calls for the mechanical verification of the correctness of the theory transformation based on the presented proof.
