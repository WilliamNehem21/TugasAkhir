This paper introduces an algorithm for detecting moving objects using sparse representation and a learned dictionary. The algorithm begins by compressing the image to minimize data redundancy and reduce bandwidth requirements. A data dictionary is initialized using compressed sensing (CS) measurements and a sparse basis, and is continually updated through the K-SVD algorithm to improve the sparse representation. Consideration is given to the correlation between dictionaries to effectively reduce redundancy. Selective reconstruction based on sparse coefficients is then performed to determine if a target is present, reducing the computational load and enabling real-time performance. Moving objects are segmented using robust principal component pursuit (PCP), which exploits the low-rank nature of the background regions and the sparsity of the foreground regions in the image. Analysis, simulation, and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in reducing data redundancy and bandwidth requirements, while achieving accurate detection of moving objects.

The process involves creating a background model using 100 frames organized as a matrix, with each frame represented as a column vector. The image size is 512x512, and the sampled data is comprised of 262,144 samples over 100 frames. The compressive sensing (CS) sampling rate is 20%, resulting in an initial compressed measurement matrix of size 52,428x100. The initial data dictionary is constructed using the measurement matrix, with 30 training iterations and a specific number of sampling columns. The algorithm updates the dictionary through the K-SVD algorithm to enhance the sparse representation and achieve efficient moving object detection and segmentation, thereby reducing data transmission and computational requirements.
