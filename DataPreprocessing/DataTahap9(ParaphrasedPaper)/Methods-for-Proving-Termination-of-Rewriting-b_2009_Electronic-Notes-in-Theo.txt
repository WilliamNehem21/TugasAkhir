This academic paper presents a formalized approach to analyzing the termination of programs using an inference system, rather than just a rewriting relation. The paper discusses how termination notions can vary from standard ones and describes different notions and transformation techniques developed by the authors, which have proven useful for proving and disproving program termination. The authors provide an overview of their main contributions in this paper.

The paper showcases an example of a terminating program, involving list concatenation with specified axioms, which can determine whether a given list of quoted identifiers is a palindrome or not in a finite number of steps, without involving any rewriting. Another example is provided to illustrate a nonterminating program without any rewrite rule, demonstrating a conditional membership relationship that determines the sort of certain terms. The authors emphasize that factors such as the association of a sort discipline to symbols and terms, context-sensitivity, etc., can significantly influence termination criteria and any attempt to automatically prove it.

The paper argues that termination of a declarative program may not necessarily rely on rewriting, as evidenced by examples such as palindrome, inf, and inf2 specifications, which may involve other computational relations. Therefore, the standard termination notions developed for rewriting-based programming languages are deemed insufficient for reasoning about termination of certain programs, leading the authors to propose a proof-theoretic termination notion called operational termination. This notion is defined based on well-formed proof trees and can be applied to various logics, regardless of whether they involve rewriting in their computations.

The authors also introduce a logic defined by inference rules, parameterized by a theory, and focus on provability within a general logical framework. The paper notes that memberships are crucial for determining the sort of a term and distinguishes the notion of order-sorted sorts from membership sorts. Syntactic determination of a term's membership in an order-sorted sort is contrasted with the axiomatized determination in the transformed theory for membership sorts.
