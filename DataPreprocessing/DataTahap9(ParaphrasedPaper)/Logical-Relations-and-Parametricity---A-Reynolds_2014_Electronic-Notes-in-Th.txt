Before delving into parametricity, it is valuable to take an abstract perspective on the fundamental structure of logical relations. An approach akin to defining categories, which retains identities but discards composition, is required. This resultant structure is referred to as a reflexive graph, which builds upon prior research on scones.

The issue with logical relations is twofold. Firstly, the function type constructor does not uphold the preservation of relation composition. Secondly, the act of composition reintroduces the variance complications of functors, which logical relations aim to circumvent. It should be noted that homomorphisms pre- and post-compose with logical relations, albeit the resulting bimodule structures remain unexplored. It would also be of interest to examine composite logical relations of higher arities. Conversely, the structure of relations under composition prompts the examination of bicategories of relations, which may also be pertinent in certain contexts. The categorical analysis of relational modalities explored in considers this avenue. The lifting of endofunctors within this framework, with relevance to coalgebraic bisimulation in alignment with section 2, is discussed in and the associated references.
