A new spectrophotometric method using reverse flow injection analysis (RFIA) has been developed and compared with a batch method for detecting lorazepam at the microgram level in both pure and pharmaceutical forms. These methods rely on the reaction of lorazepam with 3-methyl-2-benzothiazolinone hydrazone hydrochloride (MBTH) in the presence of ferric chloride in an aqueous medium, producing a water soluble green colored product measured at a wavelength of 659 nm. Under optimized conditions, the linearity of detection ranged from 2 to 40 mg/mL and 25 to 400 mg/mL for lorazepam, with detection limits of 0.61 mg/mL and 2.29 mg/mL using batch and RFIA procedures, respectively. Both methods were successfully applied for determining lorazepam in its dosage forms, and the study suggests that these simple and high throughput methods could be useful for the pharmaceutical analysis of lorazepam.

Lorazepam is widely used due to its sedative and anticonvulsant properties, especially in pediatrics for treating status epilepticus and for intubated and mechanically ventilated patients. It is cost-effective, has a long duration of action (up to 72 hours), and carries a lower risk of seizure recurrence. It can be administered intravenously, intramuscularly, or intranasally, and has a shelf life of 3 years.

Currently, only a few FIA methods are available for determining lorazepam, and previous studies have lacked specificity or have utilized only one wavelength in the UV region for spectrophotometric detection. This study introduces fast and simple batch and reverse flow injection methods using colorimetric reactions, representing a direct approach for determining lorazepam in pharmaceutical preparations.

The study found that a total flow rate of 0.6 mL/min yielded the highest absorbance and good precision, with absorbance decreasing at higher flow rates due to insufficient mixing time. Therefore, a total flow rate of 0.6 mL/min was chosen as the optimal value.

Prior literature has reported only a few spectrophotometric methods and two FIA methods for determining lorazepam in dosage forms and biological fluids, many of which require extraction or complex and expensive techniques. This study introduces new, simple, and rapid methods for determining lorazepam, offering improved sensitivity and a wider detection range without the need for extraction or heating. The applicability of these new methods for routine quality control is demonstrated by the successful assay of lorazepam at the microgram concentration level in pharmaceutical formulations. Both batch and RFIA approaches were compared in this study.
