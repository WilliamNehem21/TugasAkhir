Definition 2.2 states that given an Euler diagram C, the Euler graph of C is defined as a directed plane multigraph labeled with edges, denoted as G(C). The vertices of G(C) correspond to the points of intersection within the projection of C, while the edges correspond to the curve segments in the projection of C. If a curve segment is a simple closed curve, then a point on the curve is arbitrarily chosen to be a vertex.

In the context of {1, 2,..., n}, where all rays intersect each curve exactly once, the following extension of findings by Bultena et al. establishes a relationship between the Euler dual and ray monotonicity, which serves as the foundation for our drawing algorithm.

Our approach ensures that the regions have a specified area and is applicable to all Euler diagrams with a region representing the intersection of all curves and all weight functions. Additionally, our method provides heuristic solutions for numerous scenarios in which there is no region of common intersection.
