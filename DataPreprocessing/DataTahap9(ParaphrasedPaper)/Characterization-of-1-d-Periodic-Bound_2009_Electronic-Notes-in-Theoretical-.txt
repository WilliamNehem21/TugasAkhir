This paper presents an analysis of one-dimensional 3-neighborhood periodic boundary cellular automata (CA) with the goal of characterizing CA rules for the efficient synthesis of reversible CA. The concept of the reachability tree, as previously proposed, is redefined to classify CA rules that can form a reversible CA, and this classification enables the synthesis of a reversible periodic boundary CA in linear time.

The homogeneous structure of cellular automata (CA) has been used for modeling physical systems since its inception, and in the 1980s, a 1-dimensional CA structure with two states (0/1) per cell was introduced to facilitate the efficient analysis of CA state space. The uniform 3-neighborhood dependency of CA cells introduces structural modularity. Previous research has shown that 1-dimensional 3-neighborhood CA exhibits excellent characteristics.

Since the 1980s, researchers have focused on hybrid CA, particularly in the VLSI domain, where 1-dimensional hybrid CA have gained wide acceptance. Detailed characterization of hybrid CA and its applications in the VLSI domain have been reported.

Reversible CA has been a major focus of CA research due to its interesting properties, which have attracted researchers for applications in various fields such as hydrodynamics, dynamical systems, heat conduction, wave scattering, nucleation, dendritic growth, and physical system modeling. The dynamical properties of reversible cellular automata have been investigated, and for VLSI applications, the reversible linear/additive CA structure has been developed.

The issue of reversibility in CA states has been addressed, and an alternative method to characterize reversible CA has been proposed. The proposed characterization facilitates efficient analysis and synthesis of this class of CA. The set of 256 3-neighborhood CA rules has been classified based on their potential to form the reversible CA, enabling the synthesis of such a CA in linear time.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides the preliminaries of cellular automata. Section 3 introduces the concept of the reachability tree, while Section 4 identifies the reversible CA, and Section 5 synthesizes reversible CA utilizing the structure of the reachability tree. The rules that take part in the formation of reversible CA are identified in Section 6, and the classification of such rules for efficient synthesis of reversible CA is reported in Section 7.

A cellular automaton (CA) consists of a number of cells organized in the form of a lattice, evolving in discrete space and time. Each cell stores a discrete variable at time t representing its present state, and its next state at time (t+1) is affected by its state and the states of its neighbors at time t. This work concentrates on 3-neighborhood (self, left neighbor, and right neighbor) CA, where each cell has two states (0 or 1). The characterization reported in the following section is based on the analysis of the next states of the CA rules.

The synthesis of reversible CA is the reverse process of the analysis/identification of earlier sections. An algorithm for efficient synthesis, called "synthesizereversibleca 1," is proposed. The input to the algorithm is n, the number of cells/size of the CA to be synthesized, and the output is an n-cell reversible CA. It determines the (i+1)th cell rule of the reversible CA through the inspection of reachability sets of the rule ri selected for the CA cell. The reachability sets are chosen such that each edge of the reachability tree is derived from four reachability sets (in some special cases, two or one reachability set) as guided by theorem 4.2.

The paper discusses various aspects related to the characterization and synthesis of reversible one-dimensional 3-neighborhood periodic boundary cellular automata, providing insights and methodologies for efficient analysis and synthesis of this class of cellular automata.
