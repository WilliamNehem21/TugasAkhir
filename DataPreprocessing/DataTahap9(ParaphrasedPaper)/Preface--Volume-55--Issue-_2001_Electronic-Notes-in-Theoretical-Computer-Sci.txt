The growing significance of model checking in hardware verification and the challenges in creating error-free software are prompting increasing interest in utilizing model checking for software. This presents several scientific and practical challenges, both in the core technology of model checking and in related techniques such as program analysis and transformations that facilitate the automated abstraction of data state and reduction of control state. The workshop had two primary objectives: to familiarize participants with software model checking and to provide a platform for the exchange and discussion of novel research ideas in this domain.

The call for papers attracted 25 submissions, out of which eight were chosen for presentation at the workshop by the program committee. This publication includes seven of the selected submissions. The submissions underwent review by the program committee and additional reviewers, namely Dennis Dams, Alex Groce, Frederic Lang, Radu Mateescu, Seungjoon Park, and Sriram Rajamani.
