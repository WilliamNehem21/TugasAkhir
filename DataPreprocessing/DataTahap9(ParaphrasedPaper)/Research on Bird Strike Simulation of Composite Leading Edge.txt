Bird strike refers to the collision of birds with aircraft traveling at high speeds. These incidents can cause significant damage to the aircraft structure and pose a direct threat to flight safety. In response to the growth of the aviation industry, measures to mitigate bird strikes are being incorporated into aircraft design during the initial phases. Simulation analysis enables the optimization of aircraft structure, reducing costs and shortening the design cycle.

The leading edge skins, front and rear beams, walls, and ribs of the aircraft tail are made of variable thickness composite materials. Honeycomb sandwich materials are utilized to reinforce the leading edge skins, while titanium alloy materials are used for the beam connectors. The components are connected using rivets.

In accordance with the HB7084-94 standards for the anti-bird impact of the tail structure, a simplified model of a bird weighing 3.6kg with a diameter of 18cm and traveling at a speed of 114m/s is selected for impact testing. The calculation time is set at 10ms, considering that the bird strike process typically occurs within milliseconds.

A mathematical model is employed to simulate the impact of the bird on the aircraft structure, with specific focus on the contact between the bird and the vertical tail leading edge. The bird is represented using a smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH) model, while the tail structure is characterized by the traditional Lagrange unit. The simulation utilizes asymmetric contact definition in PAM-CRASH, with the bird as the slave contact part and the leading edge as the master part.

The simulation results indicate that, prior to impact, the bird undergoes significant deformation and fragmentation upon striking the leading edge, with the main weight of the bird concentrating in the middle part. During the impact, the leading edge caves under the pressure from the bird, resulting in the failure of the diaphragm and the formation of a hollow in the middle of the leading edge. The bird ultimately penetrates the leading edge.

It is observed that the failure mode of the leading edge skin and the diaphragm differs. The leading edge skin and the front beam primarily experience extrusion and bending loads perpendicular to the surface due to the bird, resulting in a bending shear injury mode. On the other hand, the 3rd diaphragm and the 3rd rib primarily bear pressure instability failure due to the loads transferred from the leading edge skin and the front beam.

The thickened leading edge sustains partial damage during the impact, but most of the bird's residual weight disperses into the surrounding space, preventing further damage to the front beam. Following optimization, the thickness of the leading edge is reduced to 3.653mm, leading to a weight reduction of 2.957kg compared to the original design.

During a bird strike, the composite vertical tail leading edge and the reinforcing honeycomb material break down, absorbing and reducing the kinetic energy of the bird. Consequently, the bird's speed upon impact decreases from 114m/s to 90m/s.
