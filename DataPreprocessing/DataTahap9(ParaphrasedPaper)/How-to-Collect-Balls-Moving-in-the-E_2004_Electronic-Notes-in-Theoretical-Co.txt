This paper explores the problem of employing k robots to collect n balls that are moving with constant velocities in the Euclidean plane. The paper differs from traditional TSP problems in that not all balls may be collected by the robots. The three primary problems studied in various scenarios are: (i) determining if k robots can successfully collect all n balls, (ii) maximizing the number of balls collected by k robots, and (iii) minimizing the number of robots required to collect all n balls. The paper addresses cases where track-lines are given or not given, and whether the track-lines are identical or not. The authors provide polynomial time algorithms or proofs of intractability for these problems, which highlight the boundary between tractable and intractable ball collecting problems in the Euclidean plane.

The problem of collecting n balls using k robots is relevant to real-world applications such as supply ships resupplying patrolling boats and aircraft intercepting mobile ground units. This problem can be seen as an extension of the classical traveling salesman problem (TSP) and has been studied under the names of moving-target TSP and kinetic TSP.

In the classical TSP, the objective is to compute the shortest tour that collects all the balls by a robot. In the moving-target TSP, the balls collected by a robot are not stationary but moving around. Moving-target TSP is NP-hard, as classical TSP is a special case of moving-target TSP in which the velocities of all objects are constantly zero.

In the moving-target TSP (or kinetic TSP), it is assumed that any robot can move faster than any ball, enabling the robots to always collect all the balls. However, in certain scenarios, it is natural to consider cases where robots cannot collect all the balls due to limitations on their speed or movement. In this situation, fundamental problems need to be studied.

The paper is organized as follows: Sections 2 and 3 investigate the ball collecting problems when track-lines are predetermined. Section 2 focuses on cases where all track-lines are identical, while Section 3 explores the general case. Section 4 considers scenarios where track-lines are not given. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper and discusses potential extensions of the ball collecting problems.

The paper begins by addressing the situation where a single robot attempts to collect all n balls, excluding specific types of balls that the robot cannot catch. The authors then present a theorem that verifies if all balls can be collected by a robot moving on a given track-line in O(n log n) time. Furthermore, a robot schedule can be computed within the same time complexity if feasible.

The paper then examines situations where more than one robot can be used. It addresses the problem of minimizing the number of robots required to catch all the balls and demonstrates that this problem can be solved in O(n log n) time using techniques from the previous section.

Additionally, the paper introduces a theorem that determines whether there exists a track-line such that a robot can collect all balls by moving on it, with a time complexity of O(n^2 log n) for verification, and O(n^2 log n) for computing the corresponding robot schedule.

Overall, the paper provides algorithms and proofs of intractability for various ball collecting problems, shedding light on the boundary between tractable and intractable scenarios in the Euclidean plane.
