Numerous meteorological and environmental factors affect the spread and speed of wildfires, including local climate, topography, and vegetation. The condition and density of vegetation are especially important as they influence wildfire behavior and their wide-ranging impacts on agriculture, ecology, and forestry.

The rate of wildfire spread is influenced by a variety of factors, including wind speed and direction. The condition and geometry of the fuel bed, as well as wind-driven transportation of firebrands, also play significant roles in the development and spread of wildfires in specific areas.

Various models have been used to predict wildfires, such as genetic algorithms combined with wind field and environmental models, as well as convolutional neural networks and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems. In complex datasets with nonlinear relationships, careful feature selection is crucial, and the total burn area distribution in such datasets tends to be positively skewed.

The Total Optimized Burn (TOB) model demonstrates favorable prediction accuracy for total burned area in comparison to other machine learning algorithms. Additionally, the TOB model provides transparency and access to the components involved in its predictions, allowing for data mining and insights into specific fire incidents and their similarities with other events in the dataset.

Optimized data matching has benefits for predicting total burned areas of forest fires and for data mining associated datasets, surpassing regression-based machine-learning methods in terms of transparency. By using both mean absolute error and root mean squared error as objective functions, the TOB model can provide complementary information regarding specific burned-area predictions from positively skewed distributions.

The TOB model offers valuable insights for making appropriate response decisions to specific burn incidents and can lead to more informed follow-up mitigation responses, potentially limiting the impacts of future similar events. Moreover, the method proposed could be adapted to predict and data-mine other complex agricultural systems beyond wildfire datasets.
