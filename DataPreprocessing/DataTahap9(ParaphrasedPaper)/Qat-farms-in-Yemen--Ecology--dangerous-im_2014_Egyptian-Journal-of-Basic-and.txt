This study examined the cultivation and effects of qat (Catha edulis) in Yemen, focusing on its anatomical, chemical, and environmental characteristics. Field studies were conducted at different altitudes (1450-2440 meters above sea level) in the Sanaa and Taiz mountains from 1992 to 1994. Soil and water samples were collected at various sites where qat grows, and leaf samples were analyzed for proline, total soluble nitrogen, and anatomical features. The study applied statistical analyses, including two-way indicator species analysis, canonical correspondence analysis, and correlation tests, to understand the relationship between environmental factors and qat characteristics.

The study identified 40 different varieties of qat grown at different altitudes in Yemen, each with distinct effects on consumers. The chemical composition of qat leaves was also examined, revealing the presence of alkaloids, tannins, and other compounds that contribute to its psychoactive and physical effects. The study highlighted the widespread consumption of qat in Yemen and its economic impact, particularly in relation to the decline of coffee cultivation. Additionally, it discussed the cultural perspectives on qat use in Yemen and some East African countries, highlighting the disagreement on its classification as a serious drug.

In conclusion, the study provided a comprehensive analysis of qat cultivation and its effects, shedding light on its complex relationship with the economy, environment, and society in Yemen.
