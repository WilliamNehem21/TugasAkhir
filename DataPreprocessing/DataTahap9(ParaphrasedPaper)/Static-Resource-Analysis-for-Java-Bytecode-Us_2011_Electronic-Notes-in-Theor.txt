In his work, Robert Atkey demonstrates the combination of amortized complexity analysis and separation logic for resource analysis of imperative programs that manipulate heap-based data structures such as trees and linked lists. This approach is applied to a small stack-based virtual machine similar to the JVM. This paper describes an analyzer that utilizes this analysis technique on real JVM bytecode, using specifications obtained from programmer-supplied annotations in Java source code.

The paper begins by outlining the concepts involved in the analysis and proceeds to provide a detailed description of the Java annotations used to communicate specifications to the analyzer, along with examples of its application. Additionally, it describes some of the methods employed in the analyzer's implementation.

The research described in this paper was conducted as part of the RESA project (EPSRC Follow-On Fund grant number EP/G006032/1) at the University of Edinburgh. The authors express gratitude to Robert Atkey for his extensive discussions.

While the contents of this paper are grounded in previous work by Robert Atkey and are quite technical, a non-technical overview is presented in this section. A simple example is offered, along with a mention of the intention to make a more comprehensive online demonstration available via the RESA webpages.

The paper also addresses the use of Java annotations, explaining their functionality and their integration with Java classes, fields, and methods, as well as their inclusion in compiled class files.

Furthermore, the paper introduces a placeholder method called "consume" that informs the static analyzer of resource usage at a specific point in the code. The authors propose the potential inclusion of this functionality within library code to streamline resource management for programmers.

The discussion also touches on challenges related to loop invariants in the context of the amortised analysis and the need for a systematic approach to associating loop invariants with specific loops in the code.

The implementation of the analyzer in OCaml and the representation of Java class files as a collection of data types are also addressed. The authors outline the conversion of Java class files into a low-level OCaml representation, which is further transformed into a higher-level representation suitable for analysis.

In addition, the paper delves into the representation of JVM method bytecode, including the encoding of instructions that operate on the stack and the representation of basic blocks and control flow in the bytecode.

The paper also acknowledges the limitations of the amortized analysis in handling resource usage bounds that are non-linear and states the support for linked lists and trees, noting the potential for more generic annotation and analysis techniques to handle standard Java API data structures.

In essence, this paper presents an approach that combines amortized complexity analysis with separation logic for resource analysis of imperative programs, primarily focusing on the application to JVM bytecode and the utilization of Java annotations to communicate specifications to the analyzer.
