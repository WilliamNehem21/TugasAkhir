Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are increasingly being utilized for making predictions in the field of agriculture. They often exhibit better predictive performance compared to traditional statistical parametric models such as generalized linear models (Breiman, 2001a). For instance, while traditional linear regression models require certain assumptions such as normality and linearity of variables, necessitating data transformation, machine learning algorithms like random forests and artificial neural networks do not require such procedures. Moreover, these machine learning algorithms have the capability to automatically identify nonlinearities and interactions among variables (Ryo and Rillig, 2017). Currently, these tools are more accessible to individuals due to the availability of various online courses, which has lowered the barrier for students and researchers to start using machine learning in their projects.

It is observed that algorithms achieving higher predictive performance tend to be more complex, such as random forests, gradient boosting, and artificial neural networks (Breiman, 2001a). Increasing model complexity, with the use of regularization, is crucial for improving predictability. However, the most accurate models are often too complex for human interpretation, rendering them as "black boxes". This means that it is difficult to explain the rationale behind a prediction, understand what the model has learned from the data, why certain predictions are made, and when the model tends to make mistakes. Generally, there is a trade-off between the accuracy and interpretability of statistical models (Breiman, 2001a).

In this study, a global dataset for crop production under both conventional tillage and no-tillage systems was utilized, which is openly available from Su et al. (2021). The dataset comprises paired yield observations comparing conventional tillage and no-tillage conditions for eight major staple crops in 50 countries, reporting crop yield, growing season, management practices, soil characteristics, and key climate parameters throughout the experimental year. The analysis indicates that whether no-tillage increases or decreases crop yield compared to conventional tillage is a topic of debate.

To explore under which conditions the effect tends to be positive, machine learning modeling was employed. Additionally, permutation-based importance was computed to understand the significance of different variables, as per Breiman (2001b). The degradation observed post-permutation reflects the variable's importance, with a more significant decline in model performance indicating higher importance. 

It is important to note that testing causality is essential for understanding the mechanism, irrespective of the strength of a discovered pattern, as machine learning methods can only uncover correlation and not causation. While correlation can exist without causation, and vice versa, the existence of any confounding factor must be carefully considered when interpreting correlation. Although strong correlation is useful for prediction as a proxy for potential underlying mechanisms, caution is warranted due to the invalidity of this approach when the underlying mechanisms change over time.
