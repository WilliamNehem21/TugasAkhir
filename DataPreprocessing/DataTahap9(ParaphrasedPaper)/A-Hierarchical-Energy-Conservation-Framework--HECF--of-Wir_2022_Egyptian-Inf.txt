Recent advancements in the field of microelectronics and wireless communications have given rise to the development of large-scale Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). These sensor networks are designed to sense the environment, process data locally, and transmit it to a control location for further processing. The primary contributor to energy consumption is the transmission of sensed data by the sensor nodes. Efforts to reduce redundant data transmission and minimize the amount of data being sent can address this issue.

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section II presents the related work, while Section III provides formal definitions of association rule mining and a detailed discussion of the proposed HECF framework. Section IV describes the implementation and simulation setup of the HECF framework, along with the dataset details used to validate the framework. Section V presents simulation results and a comparative analysis of HECF with other approaches, and finally, Section VI concludes the research study and its findings.

Data mining, a well-established computing domain, is used to extract significant patterns and valuable information from given data. This extracted information is crucial for making critical decisions to improve the overall system. Several studies have been conducted to conserve sensor energy by employing association rule mining from the data mining domain.

A context-aware framework, based on sensor node attributes and association rule mining, utilizes a distributed architecture to extract rules at the node and network levels, aiming to improve energy consumption in WSNs. A proposed distributed data extraction (DDE) mechanism is introduced to predict missing and corrupted data from sensors using association rule mining. Additionally, the mechanism reduces data size, which significantly impacts overall network performance. A genetic algorithm-based solution using association rule mining in a distributed mining architecture is also suggested to efficiently reduce the amount of data sent to a sink.

Temporal association rule mining is employed at different tiers of the sensor network (sensor node, CH, and sink). This approach helps in reducing redundant data transmission and scheduling sensor nodes in clusters.

In Section III, two definitions are established to set the groundwork for the subsequent discussion. Definition 1 defines a set of time windows for sensor data collection, while Definition 2 defines a set of observed values by a particular sensor in the network.

A specific example is provided to illustrate how a rule is triggered within a defined time period, leading to the adjustment of sensor nodes to conserve energy. This highlights the need for a global view to achieve better energy efficiency.

The paper also discusses the implementation of the proposed model and simulation setup, using NS2 and MATLAB v.7 for data extraction, network clustering, and result comparison in terms of network lifetime, message reduction, and average energy consumption.
