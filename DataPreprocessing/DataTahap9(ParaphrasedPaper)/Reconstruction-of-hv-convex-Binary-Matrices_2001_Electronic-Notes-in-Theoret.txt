The problem of reconstructing binary matrices from their row and column sums is a fundamental issue in discrete tomography (DT), with various theories, algorithms, and applications associated with it. One extensively studied category within DT is the class of HV-convex binary matrices, characterized by the absence of 0s between two 1s in their rows and columns, also known as the consecutive-1 property. Kuba initially posed this problem and provided a reconstruction algorithm, which was later proven to have NP-complete complexity by Woeginger.

In Electron Density Tomography (EDT), the measurements are absorbed projections that depend not only on the emitting object but also on the absorption itself. Uniqueness in EDT, particularly in the context of certain types of absorption, is known to be more challenging compared to the same problem with non-absorbed projections.

The general reconstruction problem M often yields a high number of solutions, making it too broad for many practical applications. Therefore, investigating similar reconstruction problems within specific classes of binary matrices, each with unique properties, is of interest. One such property is the consecutive-1 property.

According to Definition 4.3, a binary matrix is considered unique among HV-convex binary matrices with respect to its absorbed row and column sums if there is no other HV-convex binary matrix with the same absorbed row and column sums; otherwise, it is termed non-unique.

The algorithm for reconstructing HV-convex binary matrices initiates by filling a matrix X with initial values as "free," indicating undetermined positions. Then, based on Corollary 3.4, the algorithm assigns 1s and 0s in the rows and columns of X to represent invariant 0s and 1s, respectively, leaving at most 3 free positions in each row and column. The remaining free positions within a 3x3 sub-matrix are considered variant positions, while the others can be resolved based on the 0s and 1s within their 3x3 neighborhood. The formal description of the algorithm follows from these steps.
