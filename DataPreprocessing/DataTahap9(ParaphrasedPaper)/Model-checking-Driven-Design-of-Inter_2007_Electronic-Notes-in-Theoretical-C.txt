Several researchers have investigated the use of formal models to comprehend how cognitive errors can impact user performance. Rushby examined the behavior of a forgetful operator who follows a warning display light versus a non-forgetful operator without warning lights and checks for emergent mode confusion. Curzon and Blandford focused on goal-based interactions and developed a model to represent the behavior of a user who assumes all tasks are completed upon achieving the goal but forgets to complete important subsidiary tasks (post-completion error).

In section 2, a scenario is introduced where conference attendees utilize a web interface to share thoughts and opinions motivated by various goals (section 2.1) and a basic structure of the web interface accessible through a login mechanism (section 2.2) is assumed.

The model of user behavior is described in terms of three possible goals that may motivate and guide the user in interacting with the system: expressing own ideas in the forum (section 3.1), establishing contact with a matching user (section 3.2), and gathering information about other users (section 3.3).

Section 5 identifies possible security threats (section 5.1), defines a security property aiming to prevent security violations (section 5.2), introduces assumptions on the expertise and forgetfulness of a typical user (section 5.3), analyzes the system design under the given assumptions with respect to the security property (section 5.4), and describes possible improvements of the design to reduce (section 5.5) or completely overcome (section 5.6) the vulnerabilities of the initial design.

The tool includes a web-based interface featuring a simple discussion forum and a member list, allowing users to gather information on a conference or event and find/contact other users with similar interests. However, the tool does not provide a dating service, and matching decisions are explicitly made by the user.

A common scenario is considered where a user, after a lecture or speech, wants to meet other attendees to discuss impressions or reactions to the presentation. The user may wish to communicate with others working on similar projects or sharing similar thoughts about the presentation topic. Since communication opportunities are limited during a conference, allowing the user to search and initiate communications before the event is important for planning meetings at the conference.

After achieving a goal, the authorized user may pursue a new goal or leave the session. It is common for users to assume all tasks are completed upon achieving the goal but forget to complete important subsidiary tasks, such as logging out of the system. Consequently, a model is established to account for these user behaviors.

The system design includes a series of states and actions that model the user's interactions with the web interface, including the login process, setting profiles, and navigating through web pages. The design also considers the potential for security threats and identifies actions to mitigate these risks.

The model of user behavior is expected to capture the specific attitudes and behaviors of non-expert users, as they may have low familiarity with computers. Additionally, the model accounts for the potential for forgetful users, providing different scenarios to address their behavior.

In summary, the academic paper discusses the utilization of formal models to analyze user behavior, interactions with a web interface, and potential security threats, aiming to develop a system that mitigates vulnerabilities and provides a seamless user experience.
