The power grid reasoning expert system is a complex system, and in order to facilitate knowledge sharing within the system, we have explored the use of ontology technology to abstract and analyze the power grid security investigation procedure. By establishing an ontology-based power grid knowledge base, we have created associated relationships among procedure vocabularies. This paper introduces and analyzes semantic reasoning tools such as Jena, including the incorporation and explanation of the reasoner mechanism and inference rules of grammar. Furthermore, we present a specific application of security investigation procedure ontology and reasoning.

Additionally, we discuss the reasoning capabilities of Jena, which serves as an API for RDF and OWL. We highlight the limited query primitives provided by the Jena core and emphasize that reasoning in Jena is achieved through rule-based inference. We note that while the support for OWL-DL reasoning functions is not comprehensive, the new version of Jena 2.2 has started to support the integrated use of the dig interface reasoner.

Furthermore, we outline the core architecture of the Jena reasoning machine system and ontology subsystem, emphasizing that the inference machinery is implemented at the level of the graph SPI, allowing for the construction of different model interfaces around an inference graph. We also highlight the convenient ways in which the ontology links appropriate reasoners into the ontmodels it constructs.

Conclusively, we underscore the importance of Jena as a powerful tool for achieving semantic reasoning and research, as well as its role as a support tool for ontology research in the later phases, enabling improved retrieval efficiency and deeper understanding and awareness of ontology knowledge. As an open resources project developed by HP Labs, Jena plays a significant role in supporting semantic reasoning and ontology research.
