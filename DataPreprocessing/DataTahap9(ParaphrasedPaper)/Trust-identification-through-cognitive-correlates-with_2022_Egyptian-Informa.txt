By leveraging cloud infrastructure and IoT protocols, resources can be provided to support robots and automation systems. The operation of robots and automation systems relies on network-delivered data for assistance. Improvements to robot and automation systems can be achieved through cloud-based access to data sheets, production models, benchmarks, simulation tools, open competitions for design and system development, or the use of open-source software.

The paper proceeds with a review of relevant literature in Section 2, followed by an explanation of the proposed methodology in Section 3. Section 4 presents and analyzes the results obtained from the proposed work, and Section 5 offers concluding remarks.

The application of robots in medicine and healthcare encompasses various areas such as surgery, rehabilitation, telepresence, and sanitation, each of which requires special attention. Safety is a major concern in the use of robots in medical and healthcare settings, for both patients and operators. The authors evaluated the risks associated with using robotic systems for wrist and elbow rehabilitation, particularly focusing on safety. The results were further analyzed using fuzzy logic to gauge the level of safety. This innovative risk assessment method was successfully tested on 18 patients, thereby validating its safety considerations.

In this study, the authors presented a robust motion detection algorithm for the robot, which measures motion rate using a background subtraction technique. The algorithm captures a static image and subtracts the current image from the previously captured image to detect any changes, thereby identifying object blobs compared to the last image frame in which the object was detected. This method allows for the detection of motion against the background.

The widespread use of fuzzy techniques in achieving autonomy has expanded in recent years across various fields of applied autonomy, including control systems, behavior coordination, surveillance, and constraint management. Initially, the primary focus in robotics was on implementing basic functionalities, but in recent years, the emphasis has shifted towards developing robots that can operate independently in natural environments. While the impact of fuzzy methods in the robotics community is not as profound as in the early stages of autonomous application, emerging areas such as human and humanoid interaction and established fields such as perception demonstrate new potential applications for hybridized fuzzy methodologies to effectively manage complex and dynamic environments.
