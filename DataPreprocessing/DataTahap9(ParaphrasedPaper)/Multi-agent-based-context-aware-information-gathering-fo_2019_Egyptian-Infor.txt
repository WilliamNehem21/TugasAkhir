A system is classified as context-aware when it utilizes contextual information to deliver pertinent services and information to the user. Proper representation and measurement of the system's context are essential for context-based information gathering in wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSN). Context-aware computing aids in the retrieval of relevant information from the environment, thereby prolonging the network lifetime of WMSN, as discussed in the paper.

Existing techniques in precision agriculture employing wireless sensor networks have limitations, as most focus solely on real-time scalar data for enhancing agricultural processes. The majority of these techniques do not consider the performance of WSN in terms of energy conservation for sensor nodes and network longevity. Additionally, there is a scarcity of literature addressing energy conservation in the sensing, processing, and transmission of multimedia data in WMSN.

The paper introduces the use of mobile agents for gathering information and detecting context related to soil fertility, fire, diseased plants, and weeds. The improvements in performance parameters, such as context detection time, fusion time, energy consumption, and cluster head selection time, are compared with existing systems.

The subsequent sections of the paper present a context-aware model for agriculture, content-based image retrieval for the detection of plant disease and weeds, agent technology, simulation model and performance parameters, results, and conclusion.

The identification of weeds using digital images is explored in the proposed system, where useful plant images are stored in a database. Weeds are detected if the captured image exceeds a predefined threshold of the stored image (set at 85 percent).

Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) involves matching the visual contents of images, such as color, shape, or features, for similarity with images stored in the database. In the proposed work, CBIR is employed to detect plant disease and weeds. The system stores useful and healthy plant images in the node knowledge base of the sensor node. Camera-enabled sensor nodes periodically sense the agricultural field, check the captured image for similarity with images in the node knowledge base, and store or transmit the image accordingly.

The proposed CBIR system extracts visual contents of images, described by multi-dimensional feature vectors, stored in the database. For feature extraction, color and texture features are considered, utilizing color moments, HSV histogram, and auto color correlogram for color feature extraction, and discrete wavelet transform for texture feature extraction.

Mobile agents, known as Sensor Mobile Agents (SMA), aid in information gathering and context detection. SMA updates the node knowledge base with sensed information and interprets the context, computing and transmitting relevant information to the sink node.

When a query is sent from the sink node, the sensor nodes are divided into clusters, and information is sent to their respective cluster heads. The information from all cluster heads is fused and sent to the sink node, with the process of fusion occurring from the farthest cluster, determined based on Euclidian distance.

A Query Agent (QA) is employed to collect and fuse information from all sensor nodes and transmit it to the sink node, reaching various clusters based on Euclidian distance.
