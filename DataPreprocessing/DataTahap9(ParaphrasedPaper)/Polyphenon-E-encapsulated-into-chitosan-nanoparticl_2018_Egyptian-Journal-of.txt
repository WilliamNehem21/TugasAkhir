The study revealed that treatment with chitosan nanoparticle-encapsulated polyphenon E (CSNPs-PE) induced G0/G1 arrest and decreased proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression in tumor tissues of mice. Compared to free polyphenon E (PE), CSNPs-PE treatment resulted in 1) increased expression of Bax and p53, 2) activation of caspases-3, -8, and -9, as well as CD95, 3) decreased expression of Bcl-2, and 4) inhibition of VEGF and CD31 in tumor tissue. These findings suggest that encapsulation of polyphenon E into chitosan nanoparticles provides a promising approach for cancer chemotherapy and extends the potential applications of polyphenols for nanochemotherapy and prevention.

Moreover, natural medicinal products, rich in polyphenols, have shown therapeutic potential by targeting apoptosis pathways. For example, green tea polyphenols have demonstrated chemopreventive effects in various cancer types, including prostate cancer, human melanoma cells, and lung cancer.

The polyphenon E used in the study primarily contained catechins (0.2%), polyphenols (1.1%), and caffeine (0.7%). Polyphenon E exhibited downregulation of several miRNA profiles in MCF-7 cells, induced apoptosis in human bladder cancer cells, and inhibited metastatic progression of prostate cancer. Additionally, it inhibited carcinogenicity induced by N-ethyl-N-hydroxyethylnitrosamine in renal cells.

Chitosan nanoparticles (CSNPs) were prepared using the ionotropic gelation technique with slight modifications. The resulting hydrogel nanoparticles were characterized for their morphology and particle size using transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering.

In an animal study, Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) cells were transplanted subcutaneously into mice, and different treatments were administered. The results showed that CSNPs-PE treatment led to reduced tumor growth and decreased PCNA expression, indicating an inhibition of tumor cell proliferation. Flow cytometric analyses revealed induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 in tumor cells treated with CSNPs-PE, as compared to free PE and control groups.

Further investigation into the molecular pathways revealed that CSNPs-PE treatment induced the activation of intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways, leading to increased expression of p53, caspases 3, 8, and 9, and Bax, as well as decreased expression of Bcl-2. These changes contributed to the destabilization of the mitochondrial membrane and subsequent cell death.

Overall, the study demonstrated the effectiveness of chitosan nanoparticle-encapsulated polyphenon E in inhibiting tumor growth and inducing apoptosis in tumor cells, providing a potential platform for cancer chemotherapy.
