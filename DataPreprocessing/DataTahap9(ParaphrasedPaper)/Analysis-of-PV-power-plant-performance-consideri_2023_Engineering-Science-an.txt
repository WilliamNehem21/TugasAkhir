As the world's population expands and energy consumption increases, there is a growing shortage of fossil fuels, highlighting the importance of utilizing renewable energy sources. The increasing use of solar energy, a popular type of renewable energy, has played a crucial role in reducing reliance on fossil fuels in the electricity generation policies of various countries. The adoption of photovoltaic (PV) panels for harvesting solar energy has contributed to addressing environmental concerns. Furthermore, the ease of installation, low maintenance costs, and stable structures make PV systems viable for both individual users and large-scale renewable energy-based power generation systems.

The efficiency of a PV system is significantly influenced by the employed Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) algorithm, especially under different partial shading conditions and connection types. Therefore, this study provides a comparative analysis of three widely used MPPT algorithms, with a specific focus on the Perturb and Observe (P&O) algorithm, which perturbs the operating voltage of the PV array to track the maximum power point (MPP).

To evaluate the effectiveness of these MPPT algorithms and connection types under various partial shading conditions, a novel MPPT-based PV power plant system is developed using the Processor-In-the-Loop (PIL) platform. In this PIL-based implementation, the power stage is simulated in software, while the algorithm is digitally verified in a hardware target microprocessor, enabling real-time testing of the algorithm using the C/C++ language.

The analysis of five shading patterns revealed that all connection types maximize power under the Differential Grouping (DG) pattern (with the exception of the Series-Parallel - Three Cells - Two Terminals (SP-TCT) connection), while they minimize mismatch loss under this pattern (except for the SP-TCT connection). Additionally, the fill factor of all connection types (excluding SP-TCT) reaches its maximum under the DG pattern, indicating that this shading pattern may not significantly impact power efficiency.

Although the conventional algorithms achieve fewer global points than the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm under various conditions, they perform similarly to PSO under the Low-to-Wide (LW) and DG shading patterns with all connection types. Therefore, when LW and DG shading patterns are expected, the choice of algorithm and connection type may not significantly affect the system performance, allowing for the use of the lowest-cost connection type and the least complex algorithm.
