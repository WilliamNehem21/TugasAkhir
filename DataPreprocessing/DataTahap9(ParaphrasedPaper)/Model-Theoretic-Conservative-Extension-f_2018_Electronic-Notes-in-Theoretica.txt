This section presents the terminology of polymorphic higher-order logic (HOL), definitional theories, and their semantics. The notation and naming conventions used here are consistent with those of a specific reference, to which the reader is directed for further explanation and examples. The deductive system of HOL is not discussed in this paper as it is not pertinent to the current context.

Furthermore, the counterexample provided in Section 1 illustrates that simply altering the interpretation of "u" in "mj" is generally not enough. There may be other types or constant instances that rely on "u" (or one of its type instances), and their interpretations may also need adjustments. Our main finding is that these are the only types and constant instances for which the interpretation might require modification.

Proof: Let "d" be a well-formed definitional theory. It is evident that the empty theory has a model (this can be achieved, for instance, by interpreting non-built-in types as {}, and non-built-in constant instances using choice, as per the model construction outlined in [reference]). Furthermore, every subset of "d" constitutes a well-formed definitional theory. The corollary can be directly deduced by inductive reasoning over the size of "d", which is finite (as formalized and verified using HOL4 by Kumar et al.). However, unlike Isabelle, which inherently supports ad hoc overloading in its logic, other theorem provers for higher-order logic provide overloading support only as syntactic sugar through extensions of parsing and pretty-printing.
