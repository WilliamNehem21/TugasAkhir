In the task of weak symmetry breaking (WSB), each of n+1 processes is required to make a decision of either 0 or 1, with the condition that not all processes can decide on the same value. An algorithm for WSB should be wait-free, meaning that processes are asynchronous and potentially faulty, and it should be comparison-based, with processes only allowed to use comparison operations on the values they read from memory.

Two combinatorial approaches for proving the characterization of c were introduced in a previous work. Both approaches are based on the index lemma 5.2, which is a restatement of corollary 2. One approach involves replacing the inside of k with a simple complex where the number of monochromatic simplexes can be counted.

This paper provides a detailed description of the alternative approach presented in the previous work. The approach involves an inductive procedure that offers an alternative proof of the characterization of c. This procedure gradually modifies the binary coloring of the subdivision, ensuring that each time the binary coloring of a vertex is changed, the binary coloring of other vertices on the boundary also changes in order to preserve the symmetry. The proof involves computing how each color change affects c, and in the language of algebraic topology, it involves computing the degree of the chain maps induced by the simplicial maps produced during the procedure.

The paper also presents a lemma that can be used to count the monochromatic n-simplexes of k, with respect to the binary coloring, by counting on bd(k). This lemma forms the basis for proving theorem 6.1 in section 6.

Assuming kn has a coherent orientation, the index and content of kn are computed with respect to the coloring c defined in definition 5.3. The lemma 6.2 calculates the value of the index at the beginning of the procedure.
