Universal coalgebra, as a comprehensive theory of dynamical systems, provides definitions and proofs based on coinduction, which complement traditional approaches using induction. These coinductive techniques have proven valuable in simplifying definitions and proofs for many challenging concepts and properties that are difficult to formulate within the confines of algebra. This framework has found practical utility in diverse areas such as theoretical computer science (e.g., functional and object-oriented programming) as well as control theory, especially in the context of discrete state transition systems known in the control community as discrete-event systems. Partial automata, which are coalgebras of a functor on the category of sets, serve as the reference model for discrete-event systems and have been studied as the model for control of discrete-event dynamical systems (DES), alongside the partial automaton of (partial) languages as the final coalgebra. Furthermore, purely logical DES in the form of partial automata have been explored using coalgebraic techniques.

Concerning timed transition systems, there are two fundamental approaches for representing complex timed systems with concurrency through the use of nondeterminism and synchronous product constructs. Nondeterministic weighted automata (WA) have been shown to possess greater expressive power compared to their deterministic counterparts, with nondeterministic (max, +) automata particularly standing out for their expressiveness in terms of timed Petri nets. However, the application of nondeterministic WAs is challenging due to issues related to determinization and decidability.

A novel coalgebraic definition has been presented using coinductive definitions on stream functionals for (max, +)-automata based on tensor linear algebra and an extended (multi-event set) alphabet. The paper is structured with a focus on various aspects of coalgebraic theory, including the study of final coalgebras of partial Mealy automata, comparison of timed languages to formal power series and causal stream functions, coinductive definition of synchronous product of causal stream functions, and a discussion on future research directions.

In the context of distributed timed systems, the paper explores the use of two deterministic (max, +)-automata and their associated natural projections, and suggests the possibility of avoiding the use of clocks for certain classes of timed automata through purely algebraic methods.

The distinctive advantage of the coalgebraic approach lies in its ability to leverage coinductive definitions and proofs, which have demonstrated their relevance in various applications. Furthermore, the final coalgebra shares the same structure as another coalgebra of a given functor, facilitating the definition of operations on behaviors of state transition systems.

Moreover, the paper presents an application illustrating the power of coinductive definitions in defining the synchronous product of behaviors of deterministic weighted automata. This approach ensures that the composed automaton remains deterministic, but addresses the issue of state explosion by leveraging decentralized techniques.
