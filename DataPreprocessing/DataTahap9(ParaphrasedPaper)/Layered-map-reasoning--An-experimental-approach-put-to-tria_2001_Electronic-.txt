Due to its widespread application in the exact sciences, set theory warrants continual efforts to uncover increasingly decidable subsets, general rules of inference, and effective proof strategies. As the field of automated reasoning advances and achieves greater autonomy, numerous experiments involving set theories have been conducted using standard theorem-proving systems. These experiments continue to impose significant challenges on state-of-the-art theorem provers and often necessitate substantial user input, making them ideal benchmarks for assessing the capabilities of unspecialized proof methods and identifying the specific bottlenecks of set theory.

The experiments described in the paper exclusively utilized the autonomous mode provided by Otter, employing default settings without explicit parameter or flag adjustments to maintain independence from any particular theorem prover. Given the relatively low syntactic complexity of the theorems involved, this approach was deemed to be a feasible choice.

The introduction of the laws governing map inclusion and left-absoluteness can be viewed as a preliminary step for studying the totality and functionality of maps. These laws, in turn, will play a crucial role in establishing the set-theoretical theses discussed in subsequent sections.

In some cases, the proofs of certain laws are simplified with the inclusion of additional lemmas as input. This rationale informed the decision to organize the laws related to a specific map construct into distinct groups.

The subsequent objective is to derive a general law for determining the totality of expressions of the form total(f(r)), which will enable the definition of a number of set constructs. This law will be instrumental in proving the set-theoretical theses to be presented in later sections. To this end, we will commence by introducing two useful lemmas.
