Electronic medicine represents a transformation and adaptation of the conventional medical model by the internet. It has the capacity to overcome constraints related to factors such as time, space, and physical objects, leading to the establishment of a novel medical system suitable for the information age. This shift also facilitates better management of medical records. Unlike the traditional medical model, electronic medical records now offer broader applications beyond medical treatment, scientific research, and education, extending into areas such as hospital management, insurance claims, and legal evidence collection [3,4].

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 covers related work, Section 3 outlines the problem statement related to our sspm (sanitizable signature scheme), and Section 4 provides details of the proposed sspm scheme for electronic medical data sharing. Following this, Sections 5 and 6 present the security analysis and performance evaluation of the scheme. The paper concludes with the final section.

Unlinkability, initially introduced by Brzuska et al., is a privacy-preserving property that ensures that individuals other than the signer and the sanitizer cannot access any information about the new signature post-sanitization, even if the original signature is known. Pohls et al. proposed the concept of the hidden property, which prevents outsiders from discerning which parts of the signed message are open to modification. Subsequent literature [24,25] further provided a formal definition of this property. Although existing sanitizable signature schemes satisfy invisibility and unlinkability individually, the integration of these two security properties remains an open question.

Our sspm scheme addresses privacy concerns by effectively concealing sensitive patient information through the sanitization process. This ensures the highest level of patient privacy protection while maintaining data integrity, thereby affirming the accountability of our scheme.

As electronic medicine continues to advance, the scope of application for medical records is expanding. Given the extensive health data and patient privacy contained within medical records, ensuring security and privacy in medical data sharing is of utmost importance. To address these challenges, we propose a sanitizable signature scheme based on the key-exposure free chameleon hash. This scheme utilizes the trapdoor key to find collisions in the chameleon hash function during the message sanitization process. Security analysis and performance evaluation demonstrate that our sspm scheme not only guarantees the integrity of medical data, but also supports patient privacy protection. Furthermore, our scheme enables public verification, significantly reducing the computational burden on the receiver and facilitating deployment in electronic medical data sharing scenarios.
