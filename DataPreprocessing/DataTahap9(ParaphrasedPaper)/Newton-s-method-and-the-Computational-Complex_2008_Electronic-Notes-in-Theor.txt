Weyl used a subdivision scheme to demonstrate all roots with a specified accuracy after a finite number of steps in an intuitionistic proof. The scheme entails inscribing a circle of radius r, containing all roots, in a square of side length 2r. This initial square is considered "suspect," meaning it contains roots. As the precision increases in each level, the suspect squares are divided into four, a procedure later known as quadtree construction by subsequent researchers. By numerically evaluating the integral f'/f, the connected sets of squares containing roots are identified as suspect.

This analytic proof heavily relies on continuity, but it can be transformed into an effective computational scheme as demonstrated by H. Kneser in 1940. Kneser provided his proof within the framework of intuitionism by using an auxiliary result that allowed for a descent in modulus as matching bounds for the perturbed polynomials. By replacing the minimum root-separation with its best-known lower bound due to Mahler, an exponential estimate for the number of Newton steps is obtained.

Explicit determination of v could be achieved through minimum root-separation estimates after rescaling each intermediate polynomial to integer coefficients. An arithmetic complexity estimate for path-following in this manner would contain at least a term o(sn). It may be useful to compare this to the nonconstructive minimum number of steps estimated by Shub/Smale.
