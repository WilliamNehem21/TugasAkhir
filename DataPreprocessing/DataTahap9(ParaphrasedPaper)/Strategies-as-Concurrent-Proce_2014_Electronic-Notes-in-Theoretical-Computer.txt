As we will demonstrate, we can establish the expected rules for a recursion operator when the recursion involves a homomorphism with respect to the duplication comonad. Furthermore, we aim to derive this fact as well. Some of the reasoning can be depicted diagrammatically using string diagram techniques.

It might appear peculiar that partial strategies are considered as total functions. Why have we not defined a partial strategy to be undefined for events that are sent to "n"? This is because such partial mappings do not behave well under pullback, which would complicate the definition of composition and disrupt later results, such as the fact that the pullback of a partial strategy is also a partial strategy. With our chosen definition, we can confine neutral events to the games in which they occur. In contrast, with the alternative definition, different types of undefined would become mixed together.
