a structure that is sufficiently general to encompass all the instances presented in this paper. In some cases, determining a suitable data type and coalgebra for it is more challenging than the aforementioned approach, but the technique of proving the uniqueness of solutions using bisimulations remains effective. Example 4.1 in the following section serves as an illustration of this concept.

The next step in the recursion involves generating tk+1 from tk in the following manner: the head and tail of tk are simplified according to the two steps outlined below. During simplification, it is permissible to substitute the head of any recursive variable x with a new object parameter dx and its tail with a new recursive variable x'. Essentially, we assert that x= dx:: x' during this process.
