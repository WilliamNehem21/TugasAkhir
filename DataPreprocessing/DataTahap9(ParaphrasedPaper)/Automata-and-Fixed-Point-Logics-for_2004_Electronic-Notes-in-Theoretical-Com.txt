In summary, the relationship between automata theory and (modal) logic has been extensively and successfully studied, but not consistently or systematically. While various modal languages have been developed for coalgebras of arbitrary type, none of these languages include explicit fixed point operators. Additionally, while certain types of automata have been examined from a coalgebraic perspective, there is a lack of development of automata for arbitrary coalgebras. Consequently, there exists a notable gap in the literature, and this paper aims to address this gap.

The concept of f-automata pertains to operating on pointed f-coalgebras, which are pairs (s, s) where s is an f-coalgebra and s is an element of s. Essentially, an f-automaton will either accept or reject a given pointed f-coalgebra.

It is important to note that the definition of f-automata may not immediately align with traditional automata operating on infinite words or trees, which typically involve transition functions or relations taking input from an alphabet or set of labels. However, this aspect can be easily incorporated into the approach discussed in this paper.

Prior to delving into the main content, there are a few technical details that need to be addressed. Firstly, a finiteness lemma is required to establish that the truth of a formula depends solely on its free variables. Due to space constraints, the proof of this lemma is omitted.

Remark 4.13 highlights that standard fixed point theory also demonstrates that the least and greatest fixed points of monotone operations on complete lattices (such as full power set algebras) can be approximated by ordinal unfoldings. This connection underscores a relationship between the coalgebraic fixed point logic presented in this paper and more standard coalgebraic logics.
