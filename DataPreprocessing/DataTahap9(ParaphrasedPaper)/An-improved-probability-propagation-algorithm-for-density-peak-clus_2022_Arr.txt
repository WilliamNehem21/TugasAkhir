The algorithm's sensitivity to parameters and its limited applicability to specific datasets necessitate the development of an enhanced probability propagation algorithm for density peak clustering, namely dpc-ppnnn. By incorporating the concept of natural nearest neighborhood and probability propagation, dpc-ppnnn achieves nonparametric clustering and extends the algorithm's suitability to more intricate datasets. Experimental evaluations on various datasets demonstrate that dpc-ppnnn surpasses dpc, k-means, and dbscan in performance.

Clustering, also referred to as unsupervised classification, aims to partition datasets into subsets or clusters based on the similarity of data samples, with the objective of high intra-cluster similarity and inter-cluster dissimilarity. Cluster analysis plays a pivotal role in several domains, including social sciences, biology, pattern recognition, and information retrieval. Due to its significance in machine learning and data mining, substantial attention has been devoted to the development of diverse clustering algorithms, such as k-means, hierarchical clustering, density-based clustering, grid-based clustering, and statistical clustering.

Another challenge in clustering algorithms is the automatic determination of the number of clusters and cluster centers. Different strategies have been proposed to address this issue, such as 3dc, denpehc, and an automatic clustering algorithm based on density. Notably, the aforementioned methods possess limitations in accurately recognizing clusters due to factors like the hierarchical clustering strategy or potential propagation errors.

Furthermore, a set of synthetic datasets representing various distributions and numbers of points and clusters were used to assess the performance of clustering algorithms across diverse scenarios.

In specific experiments, it was observed that dbscan successfully identified the clusters in the cassini dataset, whereas dpc could identify the correct cluster centers but failed to allocate the remaining data points accurately due to non-uniform cluster shapes. This resulted in incorrect clustering outcomes by k-means.
