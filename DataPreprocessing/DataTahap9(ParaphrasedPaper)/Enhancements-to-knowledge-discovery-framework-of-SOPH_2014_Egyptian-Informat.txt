Recently, various methodologies have been proposed for the development of textual case-based reasoning (TCBR) applications. One such successful approach is the sophisticated information analysis (SOPHIA) method, which is notable for its ability to operate without prior knowledge engineering, domain dependency, or language dependency. SOPHIA is built on the distributional document clustering approach, providing a robust framework for advanced knowledge discovery in case-based retrieval.

This paper seeks to introduce enhancements to the SOPHIA approach aimed at improving retrieval efficiency and precision. These enhancements involve implementing automatic classification of the case base before the clustering stage in the indexing process, as well as automatic classification of the user query before the retrieval stage. Furthermore, it aims to demonstrate the domain and language independence of the SOPHIA approach by applying it to the domain of Islamic jurisprudence in Arabic language.

The typical application area of TCBR is question answering (QA) systems, often used in settings such as hotline support or help desks. In these systems, users submit inquiries and receive the most relevant responses. One scientific definition of QA is an area of computer science focused on developing software systems that can provide accurate and useful answers to questions posed by human users in natural language.

Patterson et al. introduced SOPHIA for TCBR, which is based on the distributional document clustering approach and facilitates knowledge discovery in case-based retrieval. It utilizes conditional probability distributions of terms within documents to intelligently identify key themes in the case base and organize cases into numerous clusters centered around these themes, leading to an efficient case retrieval process. In addition, it enables the discovery of similarity knowledge, allowing for meaningful semantic comparisons among cases.

Han et al. presented a QA system featuring an interactive and introspective QA engine that uses keywords to trigger cases and sorts the results by relationship. The system also dynamically adjusts keyword weights based on user feedback, employs a feature-weight maintenance algorithm to enhance accuracy, and employs a 3-layer architecture to improve scalability and maintainability.

Additionally, a taxonomy generation process is proposed to capture the semantic knowledge in textual cases, utilizing a novel CBR-specific disambiguation algorithm to guide the taxonomy generation process.

Another approach involves a keyword search that does not rely on TCBR, matching terms from the question with terms in the case base after applying a stemming step to both sets. The matching results are then ordered based on the number of matched words and the difference in terms count. Alternatively, a similar cases search, which does depend on TCBR, utilizes the JS divergence function to assign the question to a cluster and identify the most similar cases.

In experiments, SOPHIA was implemented using an edition for the database and C# 2010 for the forms. The first experiment yielded execution times ranging from 19 to 30 seconds, depending on the size of the cluster containing the result, while the second experiment showed execution times ranging from 2 to 3 seconds based on the cluster size.
