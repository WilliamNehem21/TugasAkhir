The LTE-A network entities operate in an open environment, leaving them vulnerable to security and privacy threats such as impersonation, IMSI catching, and tracking. The challenge of balancing user equipment (UE) privacy and authentication complicates the task of securing such networks.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses related work, Section 3 outlines network and threat models, Section 4 describes the Schnorr zero knowledge protocols, while Section 5 explains the proposed schemes. Sections 6 and 7 provide the security, privacy, and performance evaluations, and the experimental results of the proposed scheme are detailed in Section 8. Finally, Section 9 concludes the paper and suggests areas for future research.

Tracking attacks can occur during the initial attachment procedure when the UE authenticates itself to the network using the IMSI and subsequent mobility procedures where it uses a temporary identity (TMSI). Adversaries can exploit location information to link the IMSI to the TMSI, thereby revealing the real IMSI and tracing the UE.

While the evolved packet core is assumed to be secure, other network entities, such as HenBs and APs, are susceptible to attacks due to their ownership and accessibility. The paper proposes schemes that can withstand these attacks using signatures and cryptographic algorithms with specific computation overheads.

In the SZn-auth scheme, a third level of security is achieved through the challenge "y" computed based on "e," "x," and "d," sent securely from MMEk using the signature. Furthermore, computations for generating authentication vectors (AVs) based on a special purpose cryptographical function are detailed, including their usage during registration processes.

The paper also provides computation overheads for various cryptographic algorithms used in the proposed scheme, detailing the time it takes to perform operations such as MD5 and SHA256 hash functions, encryption using AES and ECC, modulus operations, and the generation of LTE-A security parameters.
