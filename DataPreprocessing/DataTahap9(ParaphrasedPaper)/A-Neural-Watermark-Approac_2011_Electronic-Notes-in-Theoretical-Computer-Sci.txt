This paper introduces a novel approach that combines the use of least significant bit (LSB) watermarking for images with a multiple classes random neural network (MCRNN). The proposed method involves training the watermark pattern, embedding the learned pattern in the original image, and detecting the pattern in the carrier image. The focus of this study is on evaluating the detection capability of the neural approach for identifying any manipulation of the carrier image, rather than on the removal of the watermark. The paper investigates the robustness of the approach by comparing it with previous works using various attacks such as rotation, JPEG compression, and digital watermark detection in images. The proposed method demonstrates resilience against different image attacks and exhibits high sensitivity to modifications in the original image.

In this approach, the watermark is encrypted in the synaptic weights of the MCRNN, and a neural-LSB embedded and detection approach is proposed, where the MCRNN learns and utilizes a version of the watermark based on the LSB principle. The method encrypts the watermark within the synaptic weights of the MCRNN, making it difficult to violate, and is highly sensitive to modifications in the original image. Additionally, the proposed approach performs well in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and noise generated criteria, making it imperceptible in the image.

The MCRNN is based on the random neural network model introduced by Erol Gelenbe, which consists of a network of neurons where positive and negative signals circulate. Each neuron accumulates signals and can fire randomly according to an exponential distribution of constant rate. A negative signal reduces the potential of the neuron to which it arrives, while a positive signal increases the potential. 

The training stage involves encrypting the watermark for the embedding and detection processes, and the paper explains the main aspects of this phase such as the meaning of the weights, initialization of certain parameters of the MCRNN, and the learning procedure. The detection process involves comparing all embedded patterns with the pattern of the original watermark using the MCRNN.

The experiments conducted show that the proposed approach successfully detected all attacks on the carrier image, unlike several other works. The paper also discusses future directions for the development of new prototypes that can extend the model to other digital objects such as text, audio, and video, as well as to images in different formats.
