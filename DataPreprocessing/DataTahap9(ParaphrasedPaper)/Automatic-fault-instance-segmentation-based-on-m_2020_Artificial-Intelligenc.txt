Current research on fault detection typically treats it as a semantic segmentation problem that lacks a thorough description of the relationship between faults and the spatial topological structure of the fault model. To address the need for improved efficiency and cost-effectiveness in fault detection, we propose the use of instance segmentation. Unlike semantic segmentation, instance segmentation not only distinguishes faults from non-faults, but also classifies and labels specific faults, such as fault 1, fault 2, and so on.

We draw inspiration from video instance segmentation methods, as they possess temporal continuity similar to seismic data's spatial continuity. Video object segmentation methods can be categorized into propagation-based and detection-based methods. Propagation-based methods rely on the temporal coherence of object motion and spatiotemporal connections between pixels, while detection-based methods learn the appearance of target objects and perform pixel-level detection at each frame. We aim to combine these two modes of fault segmentation, incorporating the reference profile and fault tracking from the previous profile.

In our approach, we create 3D fault instance segmentation labels using synthetic seismic data as training data and iteratively train a mask propagation neural network. This network processes fault instance segmentation within defined ranges and outputs the final fault reconstruction, utilizing a multi-input, multi-level encoding and decoding convolutional neural network to model fault combinations in the seismic data. Unlike traditional deep learning methods, our approach not only identifies faults and non-faults but also describes the relationships between faults, providing valuable information for effective fault interpretation.

We use mask propagation to achieve fault instance segmentation, employing two streams within the network: the reference stream, which leverages appearance of target faults in a given reference profile, and the target stream, which propagates key profiles to specify and locate the target faults of interest. These streams are connected through a global convolution block to match the features of fault instance segmentation. The decoder layer, with skip connections and up-sampling, yields the fault instance segmentation mask of the target profile through a convolution layer and a softmax layer.

During training, the reference stream maintains the pth profile and its fault instance segmentation mask, while the target stream consists of the tth seismic profile and the fault instance segmentation mask from the (t-1)th profile. The mask propagation neural network processes these inputs to output the fault instance segmentation mask of the tth seismic profile and subsequently propagate it as the previous fault instance segmentation mask in the target stream. This iterative process is repeated for multiple adjacent profiles, and we have trained 256 datasets for 100 epochs.
