Due to the increasing number and diversity of mobile device users, it is crucial to explore new testing approaches that can help reduce the occurrence of faults and ensure higher quality in mobile applications. The unique characteristics of the mobile context, such as connectivity, limited resources, user interface, context awareness, adaptation, and diverse settings, make testing activities particularly challenging. As a result, model-based testing (MBT) is considered a promising technique for ensuring software quality, as it allows for the automatic generation of test cases based on a model of the expected behavior of the software under test. The advantages of MBT include automatic test case generation, effective fault detection, and reduced time and cost for testing.

However, the testing of mobile applications introduces new challenges that must be addressed through scientific and technical research. Muccini et al. emphasize the need for specialized testing approaches that take into account the specific characteristics of mobile applications. As such, ongoing research in software testing has focused on understanding faults characteristic of mobile applications and proposing new testing strategies based on this knowledge.

For example, Maji et al. conducted a detailed analysis of faults and corrections in Symbian and Android platforms, while Yang et al. proposed a testing technique to address faults related to excessive waiting time for events in Android applications. Additionally, Amalfitano et al. introduced an approach based on MBT and finite state machines, called Mobiguitar, to generate test cases from the graphical interface of an Android application.

The study presented in this paper aimed to evaluate the applicability of MBT in the context of mobility. The results suggest that MBT, along with the ESG modeling technique, can be used as a systematic approach to test Android applications, offering advantages such as the automatic generation of test cases, improved test quality, and fault detection capability. However, the study also identifies challenges related to test modeling difficulties, test concretization particularities, and the need for expertise in specific tools.

Looking ahead, future research could explore the potential of automation, cost reduction, and fault detection capabilities offered by MBT, as well as conduct experimental studies to compare the effectiveness and efficiency of MBT with manual testing in the context of mobile applications.
