In this research, we explore bounded contraction rules, which are less strict versions of the contraction rule. These rules involve contracting a fixed number of copies of a formula into a smaller number of copies, and they are particularly relevant in finite-valued Lukasiewicz logics and varieties of residuated lattices. 

We then delve into the concept of focusing for systems that employ bounded contractions. We examine the possible sequences of rule applications with the aim of reducing non-determinism in organizing proofs. We divide the proof steps into two phases: a negative phase where negative rules are eagerly applied until the left context contains only atomic or negative formulas and the succeeding formula is positive or atomic, and a positive phase which involves choosing a negative formula on the left or a positive one on the right. This focusing continues until a positive formula appears on the left context or a negative one appears in the succeeding context, at which point we return to the negative phase. 

Moving forward, our work aims to determine the exact complexity of systems that combine the flew plus bounded contractions. The complexity of checking validity in such systems is known to be pspace-hard, and we aim to establish whether it is pspace-complete or exptime-complete according to Theorem 4.2.

Moreover, the findings presented in this paper are heavily reliant on the assumption that the base logical system permits weakening. Without this assumption, the situation becomes more complex. Specifically, there is no longer a clear differentiation between formulas behaving classically or linearly, necessitating a complete reformulation of the concept of lazy splitting.
