In wireless sensor networks (WSNs), data transmission for sensed data consumes more energy than locally processing the data within sensor nodes. To address this issue, data aggregation techniques have been developed to minimize redundant data transmission in dense WSNs. This paper introduces an energy-efficient protocol called the Energy Efficient Structure-Free Data Aggregation and Delivery (ESDAD) protocol, which aggregates redundant data in intermediate nodes. The proposed protocol calculates waiting times for packets at each intermediate node to effectively aggregate data in the routing path, and judiciously transmits sensed data packets to the aggregation point for data aggregation. Additionally, the protocol employs a cost function for structure-free, next-hop node selection, and partitions the buffer of each node to facilitate fair and efficient data delivery. The protocol also adjusts transmission rates during congestion and has been evaluated through extensive simulations, demonstrating superior energy efficiency, reliability, and on-time delivery ratio compared to existing structure-free protocols.

Sensor nodes in WSNs are deployed in remote hostile environments to measure various physical conditions, and data collected by these nodes are transmitted to a base station. WSNs have diverse applications including battlefield surveillance, healthcare, environmental monitoring, and homeland security.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses related work on data aggregation techniques, Section 3 presents the proposed structure-free data aggregation, data forwarding, loss recovery, and congestion control mechanism, Section 4 presents simulation results of the proposed protocol, and finally, Section 5 concludes the paper.

The paper also discusses related work on existing data aggregation techniques, such as the LEACH and TCDGP protocols, which employ different approaches for data aggregation in WSNs. These existing protocols utilize methods such as clustering, energy-efficient routing, and tree-based approaches for data aggregation.

The proposed ESDAD protocol addresses data aggregation and delivery in a multi-hop network, assuming that packets with the same event identification can be aggregated. It employs primary and secondary aggregators to collect data and forward it to the sink, improving data aggregation by incorporating a waiting time and optimizing data collection.

Furthermore, the ESDAD protocol computes various delays such as time-to-deadline and transmission delays to ensure timely data delivery. It also dynamically selects routing paths to provide load balancing and fault tolerance while reducing congestion.

The paper assumes a WSN with randomly deployed sensor nodes and a base station at a specific point in the network topology. Each sensor node has a unique identity, and the base station is connected to a data collection center via an external network. The fairness of data transmission is achieved by scheduling data packet transmission based on their remaining earliest deadline.

In addition, the paper discusses performance metrics such as miss ratio and end-to-end delay, and it emphasizes the importance of minimizing packet drop rate due to increased traffic load in the network.

Overall, the proposed ESDAD protocol demonstrates enhanced energy efficiency, reliability, and on-time delivery ratio compared to existing structure-free protocols, making it a promising approach for data aggregation in WSNs.
