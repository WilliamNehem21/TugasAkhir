Because ad hoc networks frequently change in structure and lack a central repository for posting web services, the task of locating web services is considerably challenging. Various methods have been suggested to address this issue, all of which rely on either keywords or identifiers to represent the sought-after service, or on a specific discovery scenario, while also endeavoring to adhere to the restrictions of ad hoc networks, such as energy and bandwidth. In this study, we introduce a model for assessing the total energy consumption in ad hoc networks based on the proposed mechanisms and protocols for discovering web services.

We observed that each of the discussed methods infringed upon one or more constraints of ad hoc networks, including bandwidth and storage resources, leading to a substantial increase in energy consumption. Furthermore, the proposed discovery methods rely on service identifiers, names, and types, requiring client intervention in selecting a service that fulfills their needs.

In this paper, we introduce a formula for evaluating the energy cost in an ad hoc environment based on the discovery methods or protocols of web services. This formula is derived from parameters obtained through our comparative analysis of various existing discovery methods and will enable the assessment of any web services discovery protocol based on the total energy consumed.
