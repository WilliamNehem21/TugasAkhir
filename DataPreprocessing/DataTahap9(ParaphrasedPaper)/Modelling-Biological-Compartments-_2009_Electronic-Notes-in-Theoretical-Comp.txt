The importance of compartments and membrane structures in cell biology has led to a strong demand for their representation in biological modeling languages. While the current version of bio-pepa supports the definition of compartments, they are currently used solely as labels to specify the location of molecular species.

Compartments are integral to biological systems, serving as a means to isolate their contents while allowing for controlled exchange of information with the external environment through membrane proteins. The spatial context of biochemical reactions within different compartments can lead to varied outcomes.

Small molecule movement across compartment membranes, whether through passive diffusion or active transport mediated by membrane proteins, is a significant event within cells. Additionally, membrane proteins play a critical role in intercompartmental signal transmission, such as the involvement of receptors in signaling pathways.

Integral and peripheral proteins, alongside non-membrane proteins, each play distinct roles within compartments and membranes. Bio-pepa is a recently defined language for modeling biochemical networks, composed of molecular species interacting through reactions within compartments and membrane-bound structures.

This work aims to explore the use of bio-pepa in representing multi-compartment models and extend the language to include details about the location of species and reactions. The paper introduces the concept of a ‘location’ to denote both membranes and compartments, and outlines a compact notation for representing species in different compartments.

The structure of the system is described in terms of a hierarchy of locations, enabling the classification of reactions based on their location. This work discusses the possible types of analysis for multi-compartment systems and demonstrates the derivation of transition rates for continuous time Markov chains (CTMC) through an example of modeling intracellular Ca2+ oscillations.

The paper also addresses the challenge of representing species at different locations in a compact manner. It highlights the need for flexibility to accommodate varying levels of detail in the specification of compartment structures.

The paper concludes with an overview of related works and some final remarks. It discusses the potential of bio-pepa for formal representation of biochemical systems, supporting various kinds of analysis and model checking to understand the behavior and properties of these systems.
