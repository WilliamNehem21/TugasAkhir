In this research paper, we present timed counter systems as a novel class of systems that integrate clocks and counters. These systems have an infinite state space, and their reachability problems are generally undecidable. By abstracting clock values using a region graph, we demonstrate that the counter reachability problem is decidable for three specific subclasses: timed vass, bounded timed counter systems, and reversal-bounded timed counter systems.

Our main focus in this paper is on addressing the counter reachability problem for timed counter systems, where exact clock values are disregarded (similarly to timed automata). We establish the decidability of this problem for certain subclasses of timed counter systems, characterized by the region graph belonging to a class of counter systems for which the problem is known to be decidable. We identify three such subclasses.

To analyze the behavior of a timed counter system, one can examine it from three perspectives based on the interpretation of variables. Specifically, a timed counter system can be unfolded with respect to its clocks only, its counters only, or both simultaneously. We refer to a timed counter system that considers only clocks (or counters) in its interpretation as a timed (or counting) transition system, and if both clocks and counters are interpreted, the full semantics of a timed counter system is represented by a transition system.

The undecidability of the counter reachability problem for timed counter systems mirrors the undecidability of the same problem for counter systems. To facilitate the analysis of counter systems, various restrictions leading to decidability (e.g., flat, reversal-bounded, vass, etc.) have been proposed. In Section 5, we demonstrate that some of these restrictions can be extended to the level of timed counter systems. The core idea presented in this paper leverages the fact that the undecidability of timed counter systems is attributed to the presence of counters. Therefore, we seek to capitalize on known decidability results for timed automata (detailed in Section 4) and for certain subclasses of counter systems (detailed in Section 5).

We demonstrate that timed counter systems can be studied through the counting semantics of their region graph, yielding an abstraction that accurately captures the counter reachability of the system. We derive this property from Propositions 2.6 and 4.2.

Our contributions include the introduction of a new model for systems integrating clocks and counters, as well as establishing the decidability of the counter reachability problem for three of its subclasses. Further investigation into other subclasses, such as flat timed counter systems, following the approaches of other research, may broaden these results. Our ultimate objective is to enhance the tool for handling counter systems [5,6] so that it can also accommodate clocks. Furthermore, as stated in Theorem 4.4, our main result can be extended to other data types beyond counters (e.g., pushdown stacks, lossy channels, etc.).
