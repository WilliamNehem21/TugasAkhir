In section 2, we review some standard notations. In section 3, we demonstrate that the operations performed in this article on affine spaces can be effectively carried out using Gaussian elimination. Section 4 introduces binary automata, and the subsequent section presents an algorithm for computing the affine hull of the set of vectors accepted by a binary automaton. Section 6 provides a proof of the usefulness of this affine hull in computing the place invariants of an effective counter system, a model introduced in the final section.

In addition, it should be noted that Remark 4.4 also permits the representation of vectors in Zm by utilizing a 2-complement representation. While this special feature has not been addressed in this article in order to streamline the presentation, it can be easily incorporated by either utilizing a 2-complement representation or observing that for...

In subsection 6.1, we establish that the affine hull of the reachability relation of a counter system can be computed in polynomial time based on the affine hull of the reachability relation in a single step. The polynomial time complexity is expounded upon in the subsequent subsection 6.2, where we demonstrate the polynomial time relationship between the affine hull of the reachability relation of a counter system and a natural extension of place invariants. Finally, in subsection 6.3, we prove that the place invariants of an effective counter system can be computed in polynomial time.
