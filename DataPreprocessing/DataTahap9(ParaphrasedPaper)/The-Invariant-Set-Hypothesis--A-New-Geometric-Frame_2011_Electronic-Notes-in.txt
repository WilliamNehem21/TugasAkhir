The concept of contextuality, which is made more understandable by the invariant set hypothesis, is based on the idea of the sparseness of a particular set, denoted as 'i,' where a world state exists. When this state is perturbed by changing one variable while keeping the others constant, it leads to a counterfactual state, indicating what the outcome would have been under different measurement conditions. Because the set 'i' is sparse, such perturbations are likely to lead the world state into a realm of physical unreality.

In applying the invariant set hypothesis, it is suggested that the Bell-Kochen-Specker theorem does not enforce a requirement for non-locality (i.e., non-local causality) in the system. This is attributed to the understanding that, according to the invariant set hypothesis, experimental parameters and the orientation of polarizers cannot be treated as completely unconstrained variables.

The wave nature of coherent quantum entities, a fundamental element of quantum physics, can be elucidated by the fractal nature of the invariant set. Much like the periodicity observed in zooming animations of the Mandelbrot set, the self-similarity of the invariant set is periodically disclosed through positive Lyapunov vectors, revealing the structured coherence associated with dynamically defined partitions.

It is proposed that measurement is not a fundamental concept but rather a process that both uncovers the nature of the invariant set and plays a part in the interactions that determine the invariant set. The invariant set can be seen as atemporal, wherein measurements undertaken in the future with respect to a particular point in state space help ascertain the point's location within the invariant set. This insight contributes to the understanding of seemingly paradoxical delayed-choice experiments.

The hypothesis asserts that the invariant set is partly defined by the properties of the experiments that inform humans about the invariant set. Therefore, it is implied that a quantum particle does not inherently possess properties independent of the instruments used to measure the state of the quantum system. This notion aligns with one of the fundamental principles of the Copenhagen interpretation.
