Adler, Konheim, and McAndrew first introduced the concept of topological entropy as one of several invariants of topological conjugacy. Since then, topological entropy has become a valuable tool for classifying specific dynamical systems based on conjugacy. Later, Dinaburg and Bowen proposed a new definition using metric spaces, and it was found that both definitions coincide when the topology is generated by the metric.

Due to the Perron-Frobenius theory of nonnegative matrices, it is possible to calculate the topological entropy for a broad class of shifts. This leads to the question of whether the calculation of the entropy can be made effective. Several attempts have been made to calculate the entropy of general dynamical systems, laying the mathematical groundwork for computing the entropy. Section 6 focuses on the main topic of effectively computing the topological entropy, and in the subsequent Section 7, a specific class of shifts is examined, characterized by an easily manageable entropy. The final Section 8 is dedicated to some discussion.

Additionally, it is noted that a1,..., as are irreducible square matrices, and in each block row g, there is at least one matrix with a block column strictly less than the block row that is not the zero matrix. The normal form is unique up to permutations of blocks and of indices within each diagonal block.

For an irreducible n by n square matrix, there are n! different permutation matrices p. Therefore, following the construction steps of the normal form presented in a prior work, it is evident that an algorithm exists to compute the normal form given the matrix a as input. As per Proposition 5.1, the following theorem holds.
