This academic paper introduces a method for automating termination arguments in ACL2, which negates the necessity for students to justify user-defined recursive functions and induction schemes typically covered in an undergraduate class. This approach allows instructors to defer discussions on termination analysis until students are proficient in ACL2. ACL2s also offers various levels suitable for beginners to experts, enabling an incremental introduction of key concepts without overwhelming beginners.

The paper also highlights the programming mode in ACL2, designed to familiarize new users with ACL2 as a programming language for untyped, total functions, with no logical soundness restrictions except for memory exhaustion. This mode supports macro definition and usage.

The submission of (begin-book) in the source editor prompts the highlighting of the completed region in light purple, indicating the legality of the forms for a book. Likewise, the session editor allows input to ACL2 that is not command input, such as responding to yes/no questions or interacting with the proof checker. Additionally, ACL2 in DrScheme provides a basic script management interface for interacting with the theorem prover, enabling the tracking of two separate logical environments pertaining to the same input buffer.
