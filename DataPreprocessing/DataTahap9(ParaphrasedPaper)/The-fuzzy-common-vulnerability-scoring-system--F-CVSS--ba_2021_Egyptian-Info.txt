Vulnerability refers to an error or event that has the potential to compromise the integrity, functionality, or privacy of a system, device, or service, either directly or indirectly. Each year, numerous vulnerabilities are identified and reported. Organizations with the necessary resources to address vulnerabilities in their systems typically prioritize addressing the most severe ones. However, the number of companies and systems actively assessing these risks is limited. The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) offers a quantitative method for calculating the severity of vulnerabilities and is based on the First platform of the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST). By providing standard metrics, CVSS enables an objective assessment and comparison of vulnerabilities. Therefore, using CVSS offers significant benefits. While determining and calculating the basic parameters for CVSS scoring systems can be challenging, explaining vulnerability attributes through linguistic variables is more straightforward. This study aimed to develop a model and estimate CVSS base scores based on vulnerability descriptions using fuzzy logistic regression (FLR).
