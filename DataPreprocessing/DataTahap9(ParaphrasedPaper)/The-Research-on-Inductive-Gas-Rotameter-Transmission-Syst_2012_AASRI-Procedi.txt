The complete utilization of the relationship between float displacement and inductance, as well as the correlation between inductance and measured flow, allows for the measurement of inductance rather than flow rate, and achieves non-electrified electrometric performance. This is achieved by converting the float displacement measurement into an inductance measurement using a series of circuits connected to the inductance sensor, and processing the flow rate through the MSP430. Subsequently, the system is capable of displaying the flow rate locally and transmitting it remotely, while also enabling digital and intelligent measurement.

The rectifier circuit optimizes the use of rectifier components with unipolar conductivity to rectify both positive and negative alternating sine wave AC voltages into pulse voltages. However, the unidirectional pulsating voltage tends to exhibit significant pulsating components, deviating from the ideal state. The filter, comprising capacitors, inductors, and other energy storage devices, aims to minimize the pulse elements as much as possible, resulting in a relatively smooth output voltage.
