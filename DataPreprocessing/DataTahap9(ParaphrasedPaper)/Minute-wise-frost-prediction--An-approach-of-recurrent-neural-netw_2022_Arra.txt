In the field of agriculture, frosts occur when ice crystals form within plants, damaging their cells, leading to significant economic and ecological losses. Various methods, such as heaters, sprinklers, artificial fog, and air disturbance technologies, are currently used to protect against frost. However, there is room for improvement in automating the activation of these protection methods through better frost prediction techniques.

The methodology and experimental settings for this study are described in this section. The study area is first explained, followed by the procedures for preprocessing the data. Subsequently, the construction and testing of models using the preprocessed data are detailed, and the experimental processes are summarized.

This study is focused on the winter months of June, July, and August. Minute-wise climate data for these months in the years 2016 and 2017 were extracted from 30 weather stations in the study area. The extracted data were then processed further to prepare them for model construction and testing, as discussed in the following subsection.

The remaining sections of this paper are organized as follows: Section 2 outlines the methodology and experimental settings, including the study area, data processing procedures, and experiments. The experiments involve comparing temperature prediction models (ANN, RNN, LSTM, GRU), analyzing different RNN model settings, and evaluating the prediction performance of minimum temperature in relation to other frost-related parameters. The experimental results are discussed in Section 3, leading to the identification of limitations and open challenges. Finally, Section 4 concludes the entire article.

In the second step of data preprocessing, the minimum temperature is defined as the prediction target. This value is determined by obtaining the minimum temperature value for the next 60 minutes, given that data is recorded once per minute.

This subsection provides information on model construction and testing. It begins by describing the computational environment and the use of datasets, followed by clarification of the model structures and hyperparameters. Finally, the two stages of model construction are explained.

All models are structured as three-layer models, with the first layer comprising five neurons, the second comprising seven neurons, and the output layer comprising one neuron. The cell configurations in the first two layers vary depending on the target model. For instance, for an ANN model, these layers consist of ANN cells with rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation functions, while for RNN and its variants, the cells use the tanh activation function.

The frost prediction models developed in this study only predict the onset of a frost event using real-time sensor readings. However, there is limited discussion on predicting the end of a frost event to deactivate any protection mechanisms. Furthermore, the activation of nearby protection mechanisms might impact sensor readings and compromise the accuracy of frost prediction models. As a result, future prediction models could be developed to mitigate the influence of frost protection mechanisms, potentially enabling earlier deactivation and reduced operational costs.
