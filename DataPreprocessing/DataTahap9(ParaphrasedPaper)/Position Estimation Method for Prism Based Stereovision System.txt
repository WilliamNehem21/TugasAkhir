This paper presents a new approach to estimating the position of a prism in a single-lens stereovision system. The prism, with multiple faces, is treated as a single optical system consisting of several refractive planes. A transformation matrix is derived to describe the relationship between an object point and its image, taking into account the refraction of the prism. Additionally, a mathematical model is introduced that represents the position of the prism with arbitrary faces using only 7 parameters. This model expands the potential applications of single-lens stereovision systems with prisms. Experimental results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed model.

Stereovision is a crucial aspect of computer vision, aiming to extract depth information from objects and environments by analyzing multiple images taken from different viewpoints. The stereo process involves camera calibration, feature correspondence, and reconstruction.

The proposed method reduces the number of parameters needed to describe the position of a multi-faceted prism to 7 extrinsic parameters representing its position and 3 intrinsic parameters indicating its shape. The approach is based on optical geometry and can be applied to stereovision systems with any coordinate system. Experimental results using three prisms demonstrate that the method is efficient, robust, and exhibits good convergence properties and low reprojection errors. This advancement holds potential for overcoming the limitations of multi-camera synchronization and reducing system size for application in constrained spaces.
