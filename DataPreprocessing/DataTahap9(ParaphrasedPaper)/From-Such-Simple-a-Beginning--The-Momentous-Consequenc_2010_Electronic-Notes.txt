The possibility of conducting general-purpose computation using an invertible mechanism or within an invertible medium has been a subject of serious inquiry. This was a matter of debate until it was ultimately demonstrated that such a capability is theoretically possible, albeit typically requiring a more intricate computational infrastructure. This has been documented in various studies [3,17,18,10,5] that have established the feasibility of this approach, albeit with added complexity.
