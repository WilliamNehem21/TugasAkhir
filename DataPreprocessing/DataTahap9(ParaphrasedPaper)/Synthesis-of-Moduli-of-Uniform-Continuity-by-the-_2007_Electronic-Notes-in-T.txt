The minlog system, developed by H. Schwichtenberg and the logic group at the University of Munich, is an interactive proof and program-extraction system. It is based on a first-order natural deduction calculus and utilizes minimal logic rather than classical or intuitionistic logic as its primitive. For a comprehensive understanding of minlog, please refer to [9,25].

Our method for extracting the generic modulus of uniform continuity "t" in minlog, given a specific minlog term "t", differs from the proposition set out in Section 2.5. Essentially, it involves creating a new variant of the md-interpretation, which integrates the useful features from pre-existing versions by Kohlenbach 16.
