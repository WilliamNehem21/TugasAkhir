This academic review provides an overview of the use of electronic noses and electronic tongues in evaluating the quality-related properties of foods. It discusses the working principles, applications, and limitations of the sensors used in electronic noses and electronic tongues, and compares various pattern recognition algorithms commonly employed in this field.

In daily life, the human nose is commonly used to assess food quality and detect potentially harmful gases in the environment. However, relying on the human nose has its limitations, such as subjective judgments and an inability to detect toxic gases. In many industries, sensory panels are used to evaluate the quality of products based on smell, but these evaluations can be biased. Additionally, the human nose has limitations in detecting various gases, which restricts its universal application in smell-related discrimination and classification.

Conducting polymer composites, such as intrinsically conducting polymers (ICPs), have emerged as widely used gas sensors. They offer advantages such as low power consumption, ease of synthesis, and good mechanical properties. These sensors can operate without additional heating, making them more energy-efficient than metal-oxide gas sensors.

The review also explores the use of various pattern recognition algorithms, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and decision trees, in processing data obtained from electronic noses. These algorithms have been used in a variety of applications, including determining food quality, assessing fruit firmness, and classifying food authenticity.

The application of electronic tongues as an alternative to human sensory panels in taste evaluation is also discussed. The review highlights the use of chemical sensors, including electrochemical sensors, biosensors, and optical mass sensors, in electronic tongues. These sensors react with analytes, leading to reversible changes in electrical properties that can be used for pattern recognition and classification.

Overall, the review provides valuable insights into the advancements and applications of electronic noses and electronic tongues in the assessment of food quality-related properties.
