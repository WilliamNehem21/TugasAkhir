The presence of oscillations caused by airflow over a cavity can significantly increase drag and potentially lead to structural vibration and fatigue damage. Accurately identifying the noise generation mechanism associated with these oscillations is crucial and requires immediate attention. Experimental studies on cavity flow have been conducted by foreign researchers since the 1950s, while numerical simulations have been increasingly utilized for studying the mechanism of cavity flow and noise analysis since the 1980s. In China, research on cavity flow has started relatively recently, mainly focusing on numerical simulations for small-scale cavities. The Aerodynamic Center has conducted experimental studies on flow and acoustic characteristics of subsonic and supersonic cavities. Some research results suggest that geometric parameters of the cavity, such as the length-to-depth ratio (l/d) and the aspect ratio (w/d), as well as flow parameters like the Mach number (Ma), can affect the flow behavior and noise spectral characteristics by influencing the instability of the cavity shear layer.

When low-speed turbulent flow passes through a rectangular cavity, the flow inside the cavity becomes highly complex, resulting in a pressure spectrum that includes both broad-band noise and pure tones. To study this phenomenon, an experimental platform for the cavity was established in a low-turbulence wind tunnel, with experiments conducted to measure cavity flow noise and provide validation data for numerical simulations. This study specifically focuses on how changing the boundary layer profiles at the cavity inlet affects the aeroacoustic characteristics of cavity flow. By altering the inlet boundary layer profile through different block installation methods and employing measurement methods including wall pressure sensors, microphones, and hotwire, the acoustic properties of the cavity under different inlet boundary layer flow conditions were obtained. This research sheds light on the potential for mitigating cavity flow noise by understanding the impact of different inlet boundary layer flow states.
