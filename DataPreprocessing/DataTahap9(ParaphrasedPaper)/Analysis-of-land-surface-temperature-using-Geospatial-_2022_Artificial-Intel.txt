The primary cause of ongoing vegetation loss on the Earth's surface is attributed to human activities. This reduction in vegetation has led to an increase in land surface temperature (LST). Song et al. (2021) emphasized that vegetation is a key factor driving LST changes, which is a critical indicator of ecological functioning. LST reflects the temperature of the Earth's surface, playing a significant role in both regional and global land surface studies. The conversion of land use and land cover has contributed to a global increase in LST, with studies in various parts of Ethiopia indicating a substantial rising trend. Additionally, similar to LST, atmospheric temperatures have significantly increased due to changes in land use and land cover.

To quantify degraded land, researchers have employed indices such as the normalized difference barren index (NDBI) and the modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI). These indices, along with the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), have been compared with LST to assess the ambient environmental conditions for living things and to measure the presence and abundance of vegetation cover.

Analyzing the spatial variability of NDVI, LST, NDBI, and MNDWI is crucial for decision-making and natural resource monitoring in environmental investigations. NDVI has also been recognized for indicating the distribution of green space. Despite previous studies using these indices to model LST, few have compared index results from different years to monitor surface temperature. Agricultural expansion has been identified as a primary cause of climate change, particularly LST, in western parts of Ethiopia, yet no research has been conducted in Gida Kiremu, Limu, and Amuru districts. It is evident that LST has increased over time due to a decline in vegetation cover for agricultural expansion, as well as wetland degradation and the increase of barren land. Therefore, this study aims to analyze LST using remote sensing indices such as NDVI, NDBI, and MNDWI in western Ethiopia. The paper is organized as follows: the first section introduces the general relationship between LST and different indices; section two describes the study area, data sources, and analysis methods; section three presents the results and discussions; and the final section concludes the findings of the study.

The average monthly rainfall in the study area ranges between 14.32 and 338 mm/year. The study area receives high rainfall during the summer months of June to September, as well as a short rainy season in the spring (March to May).
