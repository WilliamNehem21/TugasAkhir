Boolean automata networks (BANs) are discrete interaction networks that have become well-established models for biological regulation systems like neural networks [9,10] and gene regulation networks [12,23]. Locally monotonic BANs have been extensively studied, both in practical applications [8,15] and in theoretical research [11,14,17,19,20]. However, recent efforts have sparked renewed interest in local non-monotonicity.

On the theoretical front, it has been observed [16,19] that non-local monotonicity often plays a role in singular behaviors in BANs. For instance, it has been demonstrated that the smallest network not resilient to the addition of synchronism (i.e., permitting some automata to update simultaneously) is a locally non-monotonic BAN [16,19].

A BAN is defined as a collection of boolean automata that interact with one another. The size of a network corresponds to the number of automata within it. For a network of size n, we denote the corresponding set of automata as v = {1,..., n}.
