In the concluding section, we utilize logical block structures to present a visual explanation of two well-known quantum protocols, superdense coding and teleportation. The main objective is to establish a suitable logic for these protocols and to formalize their representation in a computer algebra tool for the purpose of simulation and verification. As such, this paper builds upon earlier research on the semantics of quantum programming languages, such as [1,19,20,21].

Furthermore, in example 3.5 within the framework of Hilbert spaces, several of the components discussed earlier are present, but a logical block structure for the standard logic of effects is not identified. We briefly outline this scenario based on example 2.5.
