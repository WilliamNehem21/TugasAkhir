The concept of program transformation encompasses a range of language processing tasks, including optimization, compilation, normalization, and renovation, among others. These tasks involve common subtasks that can be shared across different scenarios, allowing for software reuse. To facilitate such reuse across program transformation projects, the xt framework has been developed. This framework consists of a collection of existing and newly developed libraries and tools aimed at supporting program transformation tasks.

This paper provides an overview of xt and its capabilities. It discusses terminology and common program transformation scenarios, outlines the program transformation development process, explains the contents of the xt bundle, and summarizes experiences with xt. The paper concludes by offering some concluding remarks.

Program transformation involves the process of changing one program into another. This term is used to describe an algorithm or program that implements program transformation, as well as the languages in which the original and resulting programs are written. The paper distinguishes between scenarios where the source and target languages are different (translations) and scenarios where they are the same (rephrasings).

Program transformation is utilized in various areas of software engineering, including compiler construction, software visualization, documentation generation, and automatic software renovation. The paper details main program transformation scenarios of translation and rephrasing, which can be further refined into typical sub-scenarios.

In rephrasing scenarios, a program is transformed into a different program in the same language, such as normalization, renovation, refactoring, and optimization. The list of sub-scenarios is not exhaustive, and many program transformations are a combination of these sub-scenarios. The paper also discusses component-based development of program transformations, where each component may follow a different transformation scenario.

The paper describes the design of a transformation pipeline, which typically consists of parsers and pretty-printers as front and back ends, as well as various rephrasing and translation components. It also presents a case study of implementing a transformation system for a subset of Haskell, incorporating the warm fusion algorithm and utilizing various tools and libraries to achieve the desired program transformation.

Furthermore, the paper discusses the bundling infrastructure shared by xt with a peer bundle, the ASF+SDF meta-environment, and how xt facilitates the support and combination of multiple programming languages using an extendible set of components.
