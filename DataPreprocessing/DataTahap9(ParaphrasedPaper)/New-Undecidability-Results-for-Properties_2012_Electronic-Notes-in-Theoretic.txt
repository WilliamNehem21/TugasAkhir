This paper examines various fundamental properties of term rewrite systems, such as reachability, joinability, uniqueness of normal forms, unique normalization, confluence, and existence of normal forms, within subclasses of rewrite systems defined by syntactic constraints on variables. While these properties are known to be undecidable for the general class of rewrite systems, they are decidable for ground (variable-free) systems. Recent advancements have led to the development of efficient algorithms or decidability results for many of these properties. The objective of this paper is to present new findings and organize existing ones in order to further elucidate the boundary between decidability and undecidability for these properties. Additionally, the paper aims to encourage further research towards a comprehensive classification of these properties for subclasses defined by syntactic restrictions on variables. The proofs of the presented results are also notable due to their succinctness, which is partly achieved through improved reductions between some of the properties.

The paper establishes the decidability of normalization (from which the decidability of the existence of normal forms also follows) for shallow right-linear and linear right-shallow systems. Furthermore, reachability and joinability are shown to be decidable for left-linear, growing systems. While progress has been made on the termination problem, this aspect is not addressed in this paper.

It is important to note that in all three reductions mentioned above, if we begin with a flat system, the depth of the left-hand sides increases by one, and the right-hand sides remain flat after reduction. Consequently, by Theorem 1 and Lemmas 2.5 and 2.6, it follows:

The corollary is intriguing for two reasons. Firstly, the systems constructed are collapsing systems, and thus the status of all three problems in the corollary is not definitively determined by their results. Secondly, it can be utilized to establish undecidability results for other properties that are not known to be undecidable for right-flat systems.

The proof involves associating a given deterministic, two-counter machine, denoted as m, with a rewrite system r(m). Without loss of generality, it can be assumed that the two-counter machine has only one final state, denoted as f, it empties the two counters before accepting, and there are no transitions from the final state. The right-hand side of the rules in the rewrite system are derived from the right-hand sides of the transitions by identifying the transitions that apply to four cases: both counters are initially zero; the first counter is initially zero, and the second is not; the first is not zero, and the second is; and both counters are non-zero initially. The constant q is determined by the state component of the second triple of the corresponding transition. a1 (also b1, a2, b3) is z if m ignores the counter, and b(z) if it increments it (it cannot decrement any counter in this case since the counter is zero). b2 (a3, a4) is x if m decrements the corresponding counter, and b(x) if it ignores or increments the corresponding counter. b4 is y if m decrements the corresponding counter, and b(y) if it ignores or increments it.

Remark 1: The above reduction does not maintain groundness, but it does preserve left-linearity, right-linearity, linearity, and the noncollapsing property. It also preserves left-flatness, and the right-hand sides of the new rules introduced are of depth at most two (for this, s and t must first be flattened using the procedure of, for example, and their new names must be used in the new rules).
