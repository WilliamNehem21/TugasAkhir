This paper represents a continuation of a larger initiative aimed at developing a comprehensive theory of reflection for logics and declarative languages. The findings presented here prompt a discussion on the interrelationships among the universal theories of connected logics. It is anticipated that the meta-logical principles established by the theory of general logics, which underpin our axiomatic approach to the examination of reflection, will offer the necessary concepts to address this issue in a precise and formalism-independent manner.
