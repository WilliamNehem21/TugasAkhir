This academic paper explores the computability aspects of the topological pressure, which is a generalization of the topological entropy. The paper builds upon previous work on the computability of topological entropy and focuses on investigating the computability of the topological pressure specifically for shifts of finite type. While previous research has shown the computability of topological entropy for various types of shift dynamical systems, the current paper demonstrates the computability of the topological pressure only for shifts of finite type. However, the concept of topological pressure is applicable to a wide class of one-dimensional spin systems, which are prominent in theoretical statistical physics. Consequently, the computability aspects of the topological pressure can be directly applied to computability aspects of these statistical physics models. The paper also notes the relevance of computability theory in this context, as physicists commonly study these systems using Monte Carlo simulations.

Furthermore, the paper establishes that without restrictions on the type of shift, there is no type-2 machine capable of computing the topological pressure of a continuous function over a shift space when provided with the name of the shift space and the function. This result is analogous to a similar finding for the computation of topological entropy. Since topological entropy is equivalent to the topological pressure for the null function, no machine exists that can computationally determine the topological pressure.
