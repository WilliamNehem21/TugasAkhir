Falls represent a significant public health issue, with the extent of injury and associated treatment costs contingent on the timeliness of aid response. Rapid and efficient methods for capturing information about individuals who have fallen can facilitate prompt assistance and mitigate further harm.

The process of image segmentation in this study involves employing the background subtraction technique, which compares the current image with a background model and uses a threshold to differentiate between background and foreground pixels, thereby identifying the target area. Subsequently, the shadow suppression method proposed by Elgammal is employed to eliminate shadows from the foreground image. However, residual small holes and noise in the foreground image are addressed using mathematical morphology expansion and erosion operators. Ultimately, a binary motion image is obtained after applying a threshold.

In instances where an individual is engaged in physical activity, the aspect ratio may exceed 1. Relying solely on the aspect ratio to assess an individual's condition may lead to misjudgment. In such cases, the minimum enclosing rectangle will expand, causing a corresponding decrease in the effective area ratio of the person. By combining the aspect ratio with the effective area ratio, effective mitigation of misjudgment can be achieved.
