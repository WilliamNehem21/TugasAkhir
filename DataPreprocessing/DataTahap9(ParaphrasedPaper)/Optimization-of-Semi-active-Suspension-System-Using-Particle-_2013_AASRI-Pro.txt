The research paper examines the modeling of quarter car models featuring passive and various semi-active suspension systems. It compares the performance of semi-active suspension systems with that of passive and active systems, highlighting the superior performance of semi-active systems within weight and operational cost constraints. The study incorporates fuzzy logic controllers in the design of semi-active models, noting that these controllers are adept at managing nonlinearities using heuristic rules. The paper also applies particle swarm optimization to determine optimized scaling factors, ensuring the normalized ranges of inputs and output of the fuzzy logic controller.

The research evaluates the performance of the resulting optimized system in comparison to other systems based on various control algorithms, including passive systems, with a focus on attributes related to road handling and ride comfort. The findings demonstrate the supremacy of the particle swarm optimized semi-active suspension system using fuzzy logic in comparison to alternative systems, emphasizing the absence of suspension displacement overshoot. Moreover, the paper underscores the rapid stabilization of the optimized fuzzy system, leading to improved ride comfort and superior vehicle handling.

In the past few decades, there has been rapid development in the implementation of fuzzy logic, particularly in the field of fuzzy set theory. The paper notes the seminal work by Zadeh, regarded as the founding father of the field, and the subsequent development by Mamdani, who demonstrated the application of fuzzy logic control for a small model steam engine. To address the challenges of manual control of fuzzy logic parameters, the research identifies the need for tuning important scaling factors through an optimization technique and highlights the effectiveness of particle swarm optimization in this context, noting its widespread use in engineering problems.

The paper presents quarter car passive and semi-active suspension systems modeled in Simulink, emphasizing the normalization of inputs and output of the optimized fuzzy logic controller. It underscores the incorporation of gain factors through an off-line tuning process using the particle swarm optimization technique, and outlines the design and comparison of various models based on different control algorithms in relation to road handling and ride comfort.

Section 2 of the paper details the modeling of the systems and the implementation of the particle swarm optimization technique, while Section 3 discusses the simulation results, and Section 4 presents the conclusions drawn from the research.

The incorporation of a fuzzy logic controller to modulate the damping coefficient in the design of a semi-active suspension model is explored in the paper. The main blocks of a fuzzy logic system, including fuzzification interface, fuzzy rule base, decision making logic, and defuzzification interface, are identified. Fuzzification, fuzzy rule base, and decision-making processes are explained, highlighting the manipulation of linguistic variables and the transformation of crisp values. Defuzzification is described as the process of transforming linguistic variables back to crisp values for input into the plant again.

The paper outlines the specific inputs (relative displacement and relative velocity) and the desired output (damping coefficient) of the proposed fuzzy logic controller. It delineates the membership functions and rules formulated based on the inputs and output variables, emphasizing their normalization and the selection of the Mamdani inference system employing centroid defuzzification method.

The paper concludes by highlighting the superior performance of the optimized fuzzy system, particularly in terms of suspension displacement, with no overshoot and rapid system stabilization. The optimized fuzzy system is noted to provide the best ride comfort among all control algorithms considered. Additionally, it outperforms other systems in terms of suspension displacement and vehicle handling, demonstrating the successful application of a hybrid artificial intelligence technique in the design of a semi-active suspension system modeled in Simulink.
