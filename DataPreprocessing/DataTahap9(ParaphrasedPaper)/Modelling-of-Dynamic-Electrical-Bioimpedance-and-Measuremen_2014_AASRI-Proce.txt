The assessment of patient leakage current involves two separate evaluations. The initial assessment entails the examination of the current passing through the applied parts and the device, while the subsequent evaluation focuses on the current flow induced by a potential difference in the patient due to an external power source. In the first assessment, all electrodes are interconnected, and the measuring apparatus is positioned between the protective earth conductor and the electrode connection. In the second evaluation, an external voltage is applied to the electrodes via the testing apparatus, and a power supply is connected between the measuring device terminals and the protective earth conductor. For internally powered devices with accessible metal components, the patient leakage current is measured between the electrodes and a point on the housing, with the measuring device terminals placed accordingly.
