An expansion of timed p systems has been presented to investigate systems with time-varying dynamics, introducing a model in which evolution rules may fluctuate over time. The suggested model is a timed automaton featuring a discrete time domain, with each state representing a timed p system. A proof regarding the expressive power and features required for full expressiveness of the formalism has been established, and as an illustrative example, a model of an ecological system has been provided.

Numerous variations and extensions of p systems exist, incorporating features to enhance their expressiveness and based on diverse evolution strategies (e.g., different forms of parallelism). Common extensions include p systems with dissolution rules, allowing a membrane to vanish and release all its contained objects into the environment, as well as p systems with priorities, where a priority relationship influences the applicability of evolution rules. Additionally, p systems with promoters and inhibitors link the applicability of evolution rules to the presence or absence of specific objects. A comprehensive introduction to p systems, encompassing the aforementioned variants, can be found in literature.

Originally conceived as a computational model inspired by biology, p systems have also been utilized to simulate biological systems, especially biomolecular systems. Notably, p systems have been employed to model ecological systems within the domain of conservation biology, as evidenced by studying the population dynamics of the bearded vulture in the Catalan Pyrenees and the five subfamilies upon which the vulture preys.

To depict such systems, an extension of timed p systems has been introduced, wherein evolution rules may change over time. This is articulated through a timed automaton with a discrete time domain, where each state (or location) embodies a timed p system. Although the membrane structure remains consistent across timed p systems in different locations of the automaton, the evolution rules may differ. Similar to timed automata, a transition within a timed p automaton may be subject to clock value conditions and may reset certain clocks. The execution commences from a designated initial location, wherein the associated timed p system is executed, and the passage of time within the timed p system aligns with the updates of the automaton's clocks. Upon the clocks satisfying the conditions of an outgoing transition, the transition is permissible.

The capability to alter rules when transitioning from one location to another enables the modeling of dynamics changes due to varying environmental conditions. For instance, locations corresponding to different seasons can entail diverse population dynamics. Moreover, the addition and removal of objects in the skin membrane accommodate modeling changes in population composition driven by environmental shifts.

A class of contents-timed p systems has been defined, featuring timed evolution rules whose execution times may vary as the timed p system evolves, contingent on the system's state. Although related to our work, this approach is limited to altering the execution times of rules, which remain constant, whereas in timed p automata, the rules can be entirely rewritten, contingent on time progression (but not on the state of the timed p system).

The evolution step of a timed p system is described, elaborating on the constraints of rule application and the handling of objects within and across membranes. Additionally, a method to calculate the least common multiple of n1 and n2, designated as lcm(n1, n2), is expounded, leveraging the appearance of specific objects in membrane 1 at defined intervals. The necessary transitions are specified, encompassing clock resets and the insertion of objects into the skin membrane of the received timed p structure, ultimately yielding a new timed p system with the same membrane structure but a distinct set of rules.

Formally, timed p automata are delineated, with clock variables being the focal point, and plans to incorporate probabilities to obtain a stochastic model and allow more precise specifications are outlined. In a specific model, females are categorized into two classes with differing fecundity rates, and distinct survival rates are ascribed to juveniles and adults.

Overall, the proposed extension of timed p systems and timed automata presents a versatile framework for studying dynamic systems, particularly in the domain of ecological modeling, by explicitly capturing temporal variations in evolution rules and enabling the representation of diverse population dynamics influenced by environmental conditions.
