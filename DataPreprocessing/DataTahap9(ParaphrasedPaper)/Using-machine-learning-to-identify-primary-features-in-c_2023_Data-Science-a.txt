An electric vehicle is a popular choice among vehicle owners, likely due to its zero emissions and smooth driving experience. Majumder (2021) found that electric vehicles have a mechanical efficiency between 60% and 70%, whereas vehicles with internal combustion engines have an efficiency of 18% to 22%. However, concerns about the short range and charging difficulties hinder the widespread adoption of electric vehicles. On average, gasoline-powered vehicles have a range of 300 miles, while electric vehicles have an average range of 110 miles. Additionally, the current battery technology in electric vehicles does not support long-distance driving.

Several authors have suggested that households with higher annual incomes are more interested in and likely to own electric vehicles compared to lower-income households. The higher cost of electric vehicles is a contributing factor, and those earning more than 90,000 euros per year are more concerned about fuel efficiency, technical reliability, and safety, while those earning less than 10,000 euros per year prioritize financial savings. Owners earning 10,000 euros per year and owning electric vehicles are also concerned about public charging availability and speed. This income disparity leads to different considerations and decisions regarding the adoption of electric vehicles.

This study seeks to predict the current ownership of electric vehicles based on various income levels in the United States using classification machine learning models. Different models, such as SVM, logistic regression, decision tree, and Naive Bayesian, are employed to classify ownership and identify the primary factors affecting different income levels in the U.S.

After eliminating null values, the dataset contains 93% battery electric vehicle (BEV) owners and 7% fuel cell vehicle (FCV) owners, resulting in an extremely unbalanced dataset. We oversample the records of FCV owners to balance the dataset for training and testing.

Sovacoola, Kesterb, Noel, and Rubens found that among all income levels, individuals in higher age brackets such as government officials and retirees demonstrate an increasing trend in ownership of electric vehicles, even with limited experience with them. This may be due to shorter commuting distances and higher budgets among older individuals. Additionally, larger households exhibit more experience with electric vehicles than smaller households and may have less inclination to own an electric vehicle.

This study focuses on identifying the primary features influencing the choice of electric vehicles based on income level. Complex methods such as neural networks were not utilized to prioritize explainable machine learning techniques. Naive Bayesian models were found to offer the highest accuracy for each income level. The study's results indicate that one-way commuting distance is the most crucial factor for low-medium, medium-high, and high-income levels. However, the study's scope is limited by local infrastructure, culture, and weather conditions, and the researchers hope to expand their work to encompass more extensive datasets on electric vehicles in the future.
