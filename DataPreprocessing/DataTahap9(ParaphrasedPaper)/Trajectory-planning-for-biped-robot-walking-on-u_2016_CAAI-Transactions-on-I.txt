The paper introduces a control system for humanoid robots walking on irregular terrain by analyzing the movement characteristics of the robots and exploring methods to overcome the challenges of walking on uneven surfaces and stepping over stairs. To address the limitations of directly controlling the robot with neural networks and fuzzy logic controllers, the authors propose a revised particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to train the weights of the neural network and the rules of the fuzzy logic controller. The study conducts simulations and experiments to compare the performance of different control methods and demonstrates that the proposed methods result in more effective control.

The authors discuss several methods used to enhance the stability and efficiency of humanoid robot movement. One method involves the design of a trajectory generator based on the zero moment point (ZMP) fuzzy logic controller, which has been proven effective in simulations. However, the algorithm's main drawback is its suboptimal trajectory generation due to the lack of an optimization process. Another method involves the use of a fuzzy reinforcement learning structure to maintain dynamic stability during biped robot movement, but it is noted that this approach may suffer from falling into local optima. To address these issues, the paper proposes a modified PSO algorithm, referred to as MPSo, which combines the benefits of both PSO and genetic algorithms to avoid getting stuck in local optima.

The study also presents an analysis of the constraints and kinematics involved in humanoid robots stepping over stairs and provides an example of using the modified PSO algorithm, MPSo, to control the robot's motion. Additionally, the paper discusses the application of recurrent neural networks for controlling a robot arm and explores the challenges associated with reducing the training time for neural networks.

Furthermore, the paper details the design of two three-forward networks tailored for the features of humanoid robot movement, specifically for the double support period of stepping over stairs. The approach involves using neural networks to optimize the robot's movement and introducing a fuzzy logic controller to regulate node angle changes during the robot's motion.

Lastly, the paper describes the mixed PSO algorithm used to optimize the neural network weights and fuzzy logic controller rules for controlling robot movement and presents a comparison of different control methods through simulations and testing.
