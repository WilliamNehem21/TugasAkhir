In prior research, we developed an efficient rewrite system for specializing and optimizing generic programs. This paper extends the system to handle recursive data types, focusing on inductive types that can be defined as fixpoints of functors. The key concept involves specializing traversal combinators using well-known recursion patterns such as folds or paramorphisms. This allows for aggressive optimizations ruled by a set of algebraic laws. We also present a type-safe encoding of this rewrite system in Haskell, leveraging recent language extensions like type-indexed type families.

However, using this style of generic programming comes with a performance cost. Generic functions exhibit much worse performance than analogous non-generic ones. For instance, the SYB implementation of a standard set of benchmark functions was reported to run an average of seven times slower than the non-generic implementation. A part of this performance loss is attributed to the run-time checks required to determine whether to apply specific or generic behavior at each node. The remaining performance loss is due to structural reasons inherent to this style of generic programming: the traversal combinators must traverse the entire data structure, even if a certain branch does not mention types where the specific behavior applies.

To address this efficiency problem, new SYB-like generic programming libraries have been proposed. Two of the most efficient libraries identified in a recent survey are Uniplate and Smash. Uniplate outperforms SYB by restricting the power of the traversal combinators, while Smash offsets some of the run-time checks to compile-time, albeit requiring additional work from the programmer to support new data types.

In our previous work, we developed a rewrite system to specialize generic functions for specific types, but it lacked support for user-defined recursive types. The primary contribution of this paper is extending this specialization mechanism to also cover recursive data types, particularly inductive data types that can be defined as fixpoints of functors. The specialized definitions resulting from this new rewrite system demonstrate runtimes close to those of hand-written non-generic ones. Additionally, we present a Haskell encoding of these new laws utilizing recent language extensions such as type-indexed type families.

To avoid infinite expansions, we specialize traversal combinators using an alternative definition based on standard recursion patterns such as folds. Similar to point-free combinators, these recursion patterns are characterized by powerful algebraic laws that enable optimization of the specialized definitions.

To overcome this problem, we utilize type-indexed type families, a new extension to the Haskell type system already supported in GHC, to represent functors. Developed with type-level programming in mind, type families are type constructors representing sets of types, aggregated according to the type parameters passed to the type family constructor, called type indices.

Unlike systems designed to implement fusion, our rewrite system cannot implement the full power of fusion laws. However, it covers most of the particular instances occurring during the specialization of generic functions.

Compared to libraries designed with performance in mind, like Uniplate, or using compile-time optimizations like Smash, our approach optimizes generic functions more efficiently and can handle more powerful combinators targeting different types in a single traversal.

A different approach has been taken in a technique named symbolic evaluation, which was developed to optimize generic Haskell programs. This technique focuses on the specialization of fully applied functions and aims to eliminate conversions between types and their structural representations.

Our main goal was to extend the specialization mechanism presented earlier to cover inductive types. This technique has been harnessed into the prototype schema-aware XPath compiler XPTO, with the aim of optimizing the execution of XPath queries against XML files conforming to a given schema.

We have extended an existing mechanism to specialize SYB-like generic functions to also cover user-defined recursive data types. By focusing on inductive types, we were able to use recursion patterns such as folds and paramorphisms to encode generic traversals, incorporating algebraic laws in a type-safe rewrite to optimize the specialized code. Our implementation closely mimics the theoretical presentation, thanks to recent extensions of the Haskell type system.

The main limitation of our current approach is that it only supports single-recursive inductive types. We are currently exploring how to extend it to cover more general forms of recursion, such as mutually-inductive data types or nested data types, which are relevant to higher-order functors and nested data types.
