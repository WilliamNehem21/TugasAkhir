Research is underway to explore the potential of concurrent strategies as a foundational framework for a more general domain theory. This involves investigating how concurrent games and strategies can replace domains and continuous functions, with the aim of expanding the scope of denotational semantics. Therefore, it is crucial to examine how concurrent strategies can be adapted to quantitative semantics, including probabilistic and quantum strategies.

Similar to event structures serving as models of distributed computation, probabilistic event structures can be viewed as models of probabilistic distributed processes. However, existing definitions of probabilistic event structures are not sufficiently general to assign probabilities to the outcomes of partially interacting strategies. To address this, a new definition of probabilistic event structures is proposed in this paper, extending on existing definitions. Probabilistic event structures are defined as event structures with a continuous valuation on their domain.

In the context of quantum games, players and opponents collaborate to create a probabilistic distributed experiment on a quantum system. Consequently, a quantum strategy is considered to be a distributed probabilistic strategy on a quantum event structure, in line with previous work on quantum games. There are resemblances with the work of delbecque, which is itself based on probabilistic ho games.

Without knowledge of the stochastic rates of players and opponents, it is not feasible to assign probabilities to play outcomes in the presence of races, i.e., immediate conflicts between moves of opposite polarities. The results regarding probabilistic strategies are contingent on restricting games to those that are race-free.

Regarding blackwell games, total strategies are consistent with those conventionally utilized. Considering symmetry in games is important for various reasons, including situations where distinct plays are essentially similar to one another. Symmetry can aid in the analysis of games by reducing the number of cases to consider and compensating for the overly-concrete nature of event structures in representing games, especially in terms of many useful operations that are not monads or comonads.
