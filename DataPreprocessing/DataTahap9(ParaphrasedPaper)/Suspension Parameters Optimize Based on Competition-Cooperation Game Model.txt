Multi-objective optimization has maintained its relevance for many years, and its application in engineering problem-solving remains steadfast. The primary focus in addressing engineering problems through multi-objective optimization lies in identifying the Pareto-optimal solutions. However, it is important to note that Pareto-optimal solutions may not always exist, necessitating the development of effective approaches to address multi-objective optimization problems. In recent decades, various algorithms, including ant colony, genetic, particle swarm, artificial fish swarm, and their enhanced versions, have emerged to tackle this challenge.

The objective of multi-objective optimization is to identify optimal values, while game theory aims to determine the maximum profit for each party involved. Despite their differences, both approaches share a common goal of seeking Pareto solutions. Game theory, particularly in the context of engineering, is utilized to address multi-objective optimization problems, and can be categorized into cooperative, selfish, and non-cooperative games based on the behavior of the involved parties.
