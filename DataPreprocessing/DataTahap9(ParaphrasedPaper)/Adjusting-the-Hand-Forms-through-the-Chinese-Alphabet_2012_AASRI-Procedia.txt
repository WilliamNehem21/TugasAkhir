The Chinese alphabet comprises 33 letters and 4 phonetic symbols, and is governed by 10 combined rules. These rules allow for the creation of 1383 distinct hand forms when using the Chinese alphabetic passwords. By adjusting hand forms according to the Chinese alphabet, individuals can seek conscious passwords, potentially pinpointing them within the fingers. Additionally, these 1383 hand forms may be represented in the form of a patent.

At present, the combined laws of Chinese alphabetic passwords have been delineated. Hand forms can be modified in accordance with the Chinese alphabet to seek conscious passwords. These conscious passwords hold more instructional value than the Chinese alphabetic passwords, a point we aim to illustrate through examples.
