The task of identifying high-quality marine shale gas reservoirs has always been a crucial aspect of the exploration and development process. However, the nonlinear relationship between logging curve response and high-quality reservoirs has posed challenges for accurately and rapidly identifying them. In this study, a combination of the oversampling method and random forest algorithm is proposed to enhance the accuracy of identifying high-quality reservoirs based on logging data. The oversampling method is utilized to balance the number of samples of different types, while the random forest algorithm is employed to establish a high-precision and high-quality reservoir identification model. The proposed method has significantly increased the accuracy of reservoir identification from 44% to 78%, demonstrating considerable improvement. This research has the potential to enhance the identification of high-quality marine shale gas reservoirs, provide guidance for drilling horizontal wells, and offer valuable support for the precise development planning of marine shale gas.

Various methods for identifying high-quality reservoirs in shale formations have been proposed, such as support vector machines and machine learning-informed ensemble frameworks. However, challenges still exist in identifying sweet beds, including unbalanced sample sets used for modeling due to core sampling biases and varying prediction effects of different algorithms. To address these challenges, this paper presents a rapid identification framework for high-quality marine shale reservoirs that combines the oversampling method and random forest algorithm to achieve improved identification effects. The proposed framework aims to quickly identify high-quality reservoirs in shale gas wells and has shown a significant enhancement in identification accuracy.

The study applies two main techniques for reservoir identification: oversampling methods to address unbalanced data and random forest algorithms to tackle classification problems. The random forest algorithm is an ensemble learning algorithm based on decision trees, which uses bootstrap technology to construct a single decision tree from randomized samples and combines multiple decision trees for final prediction results.

In addition to proposing and explaining the application of the oversampling method and random forest algorithm in reservoir identification, the study also provides insights into the challenges related to reservoir type distribution and the limited availability of core samples for high-quality reservoirs. The findings indicate that the random forest algorithm outperforms other algorithms in prediction accuracy and has relatively better prediction effects for identifying the highest quality type I reservoirs. Overall, the proposed approach has demonstrated significant improvements in the identification of high-quality marine shale gas reservoirs.
