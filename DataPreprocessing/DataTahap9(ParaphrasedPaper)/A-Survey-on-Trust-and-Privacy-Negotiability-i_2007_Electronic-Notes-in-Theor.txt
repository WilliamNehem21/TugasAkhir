Price discrimination refers to the practice in which a seller offers a product or service at varying prices based on certain characteristics of the buyer or through negotiation. It is generally believed in economics that price discrimination can be beneficial for both the seller and the buyer. However, in order to implement price discrimination, the seller needs to gather information about the buyer to differentiate between customers and set the optimal price. Therefore, it is rational for the seller to seek efficient methods of collecting and accessing personal data for this purpose.

The wording of survey questions is crucial to ensure that respondents understand them correctly and unambiguously. To achieve this, a preliminary questionnaire was developed and tested on a group of university students to receive feedback and guidance on the interpretation and response to the questions. Some questions were structured as yes/no (nominal) while others used a scale of ordinals (e.g., on a scale from 1 to 5).

An interesting aspect of the study was to investigate whether there is a difference in willingness to provide personal data when the data is made anonymous as opposed to being named. It was hypothesized that the negotiability of privacy might be influenced by this distinction, and that it could be interesting to explore the possibility of anonymous price discrimination, such as in the case of child/adult bus tickets.
