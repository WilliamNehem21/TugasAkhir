This academic paper explores the use of simulation to investigate communication protocols, focusing on a performance study of the distributed coordination function of 802.11 networks. The study presents an analysis of the different classes of petri nets used to model network protocols and their effectiveness in formal methods. It introduces a detailed 802.11b model based on object-oriented petri nets to improve precision in modeling the backoff procedure and time synchronization. The performance analyses are then evaluated through simulation in dense wireless networks and compared with other measurement approaches. The main objective is to propose a modular model to assess the impact of network performance on distributed discrete event systems.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a mathematical definition and comparison of different classes of petri nets, discussing their benefits and weaknesses in modeling communication protocols. Section 3 introduces the IEEE 802.11b DCF and presents the developed model, followed by validation of the performance analysis through simulation.

Petri nets, which were proposed by C.A. Petri in 1962, are described as a powerful formalism in computer science and system engineering, used for modeling distributed, parallel, and stochastic systems, especially discrete event systems. They are available in mathematical and graphical forms, enabling the study and description of various system types.

Regarding the modeling approach, the paper suggests that timed petri nets may not adequately address certain characteristics, such as stochastic behavior and time variations or intervals. It also explains that object-oriented petri nets (OOPN) can be viewed as a specialized form of high-level petri nets, offering the representation and manipulation of objects in complex systems, which enhances the model's flexibility.

Furthermore, the paper gives an overview of the 802.11 wireless MAC protocol, focusing particularly on the distributed coordination function (DCF), which utilizes the carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) mechanism, as well as the point coordination function (PCF) for priority-based access. The performance simulations are conducted in dense networks with varying numbers of workstations, assuming all nodes transmit at 11Mbps and attempt to send data as quickly as possible, with each host having 1000 packets of an average length of 1150 bytes.
