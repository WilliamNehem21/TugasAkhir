This paper introduces a new decision procedure that replaces a crucial component of a previously published method. The article is self-contained and assumes that most readers are not familiar with the prior work. It includes basic definitions in the next section to aid understanding, presents the main theorem in Section 3, describes the new decision procedure in Section 4, and presents experimental results in Section 5. A detailed comparison to prior work appears in Section 4.2.

The paper discusses the use of chordal graphs in enforcing transitivity on triangles. It notes that while a graph can contain an exponential number of contradictory cycles, it can only contain a polynomial number of triangles. Enforcing transitivity on triangles is shown to be sufficient for enforcing it on all contradictory cycles.

The paper additionally presents the rtc algorithm, which constrains simple contradictory cycles, and introduces the new algorithm rtcs, which builds on rtc and focuses on constraining simple contradictory cycles. The paper highlights that it is sufficient to focus on biconnected components (bccs) because only cycles, specifically contradictory cycles, need to be constrained.

The paper also includes a lemma concerning the existence of simple contradictory cycles in dashed triangles within a graph.

Experimental results presented in the paper demonstrate a decrease of 17% in the number of transitivity constraints and a 32% decrease in algorithm run time (not including satisfiability time) compared to prior methods. The new algorithm is shown to outperform existing approaches in terms of constraint generation.
