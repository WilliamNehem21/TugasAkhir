The objective of this study is to develop an approximation of models representing transport and availability in blood vessels using continuous-time Markov chains (CTMC) with levels. CTMCs with levels are characterized by discrete levels of concentration for each chemical species. The rationale for this approach is to enable additional analysis, such as testing the robustness of the models under different levels of stochasticity. Additionally, using such semantics ensures that bio-PEPA, a modeling language based on CTMC with levels, and its associated tools can be employed to model and analyze this scenario. A key component required for this approach is the derivation of diffusion in one-dimensional cylindrical coordinates in terms of CTMC with levels. This paper presents such a derivation, introducing new contributions in the process.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 covers the derivation of partial differential equations (PDEs) to CTMC with levels, Section 3 provides an example, Section 4 discusses related work, and Section 5 contains conclusions and outlines future work.

The derivations in this study pertain to a one-dimensional model in cylindrical coordinates. Although only the radius dimension is considered, it is important to note that the concentration at each point r from the center represents the concentration along the circumference of the circle with radius r. The length of the cylinder can be disregarded, as it remains constant in the derivations. As a result, the terms "area" and "volume" are used interchangeably.

The study demonstrates the capability to derive ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with compartments from PDEs in cylindrical coordinates. This is feasible due to the established correspondence between the diffusion constant (ds) in the PDE and the kinetic constants (ki,j) of mass action transport reactions in the ODEs. Consequently, it is shown that the corresponding CTMC with levels can be derived.

In order to ensure that the state space of the CTMC remains finite, a maximum concentration (mi) is established for each variable (si), which is then divided into ni intervals representing hi molar concentration, with hi=mi/ni and i= 1,..., k.

The translation from ODEs to CTMC with levels of concentration is rooted in previous work and has been further investigated. The study also addresses the consideration of transport between compartments.
