The aim of this paper is to outline a set of characteristics of a physical theory that indicate its reliance on complex numbers. These properties relate to the interactions between physical processes and are presented in an intuitive and physical manner. The paper's approach is robust and does not dwell on specific details of the theory, such as dynamics or measurement descriptions.

The authors introduce the concept of the category of processes associated with a given physical theory. Although realistic physics theories may not naturally align with this category, some theories may have relevant attributes. If a theory exhibits the described properties, it suggests that complex numbers are utilized in the underlying theory. For instance, in the case of quantum mechanics, where systems are represented by separable Hilbert spaces and processes by bounded linear maps, the theory relies on complex numbers, and its category of processes fulfills the characteristics outlined.

In any monoidal category, the scalars are defined as the hom-set hom(i, i), which possess additional structure based on the properties of the encompassing category. At the very least, it can be recognized as a commutative monoid, with monoid multiplication represented by morphism composition.

The paper proceeds to provide a proof, leveraging the established properties of scalars in a category. It deduces implications and employs a theorem to demonstrate that the self-adjoint elements of a given field adhere to a certain order. While this ordering may not be unique or canonical, the paper concludes by outlining the broad implications of this finding.

In analyzing specific scenarios and applying the established theorems, the paper arrives at a conclusion about the ordering of certain elements within the field. It illustrates various cases and disproves certain hypothetical situations to validate conclusions about relationships between elements and their ordering.

Overall, the paper presents a comprehensive examination of the properties of a theoretical physics framework that indicate its reliance on complex numbers, and expertly utilizes mathematical reasoning to support its claims.
