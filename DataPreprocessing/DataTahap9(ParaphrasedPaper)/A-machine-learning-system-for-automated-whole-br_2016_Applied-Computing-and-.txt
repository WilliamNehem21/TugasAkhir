Detecting patterns of seizure activity that are applicable across different brain regions and multiple individuals may offer a potential solution. This paper delves deeper into this concept and presents a supervised machine learning technique for categorizing seizure and non-seizure records using a publicly available dataset comprising 342 records (171 seizures and 171 non-seizures). The approach introduces a novel method for generalizing seizure detection across various individuals without previous knowledge of the specific seizure focal point. The results demonstrate an enhancement over existing studies with 88% sensitivity, 88% specificity, and 93% area under the curve, along with a 12% global error rate when employing the k-nn classifier.

Epilepsy, a chronic neurological condition, is characterized by recurrent seizures, commonly known as fits, and is estimated to affect 70 million people worldwide. The development of epilepsy is most prevalent at the extremes of life, with a higher incidence in the elderly population compared to the young, contributing to premature mortality in affected individuals.

Seizures can manifest as focal (partial), confined to a specific brain region, or as generalized, impacting both halves of the brain. During a focal seizure, individuals may remain conscious and unaware of the seizure, or experience uncontrolled movements or unusual sensations. Diagnosis of epilepsy typically involves electroencephalogram (EEG) testing, which represents the brain's electrical activity over time.

A comprehensive approach to seizure detection from across the entire brain can complement diagnostic evidence obtained from magnetic resonance imaging and EEG, aiding in earlier treatment initiation. Such an approach can also mitigate the challenges associated with capturing and interpreting EEG data by neurologists. This paper adopts a robust data processing methodology and trains and evaluates several classifiers using 342 EEG segments extracted from records of 24 epilepsy patients.

The subsequent sections of this paper detail the principles of EEG and the features derived from its signals, the use of machine learning for seizure and non-seizure classification, and the evaluation of the results before the conclusion.

Previous studies have commonly utilized the support vector machine (SVM) classifier to distinguish between seizure and non-seizure events. Other studies have explored correlation dimension, a measure of nonlinear univariate used to assess fractal dimension, and statistical moments such as skewness and kurtosis for seizure detection.

Most studies in EEG detection focus on detecting patient-specific focal seizures, as the patterns of seizure activity are unique to each individual. However, this paper aims to detect seizures across a broader population, utilizing machine learning algorithms integrated with clinical systems to enhance epilepsy diagnostics.

The analysis involves 24 cases, with the patients' ages ranging from 1.5 to 22 years and a majority of EEG recordings lasting for one hour. The dataset includes both seizure and non-seizure records, with the number of records containing seizures totaling 198 out of 686.

The paper outlines the feature selection process, the classification of algorithms, and the evaluation of their performance using various validation techniques, such as holdout cross-validation, sensitivities, specificities, receiver operating curve (ROC), and area under the curve (AUC).

The study successfully discriminates between seizure and non-seizure EEG records across a group of 23 subjects, generalizing the classification across the entire population. Using different classifiers, the approach achieved favorable results, with the k-nn classifier notably demonstrating high sensitivity and specificity.

The future clinical applications of this work include its potential use in investigating patients with suspected seizure disorders and assessing patients with non-epileptic attack disorder (NEAD). Automated seizure detection technologies could address the shortage of trained clinical neurophysiologists and improve the capacity of healthcare systems.

Future work will consider additional features described in the literature, explore advanced machine learning algorithms, investigate optimal window sizes, and utilize regression analysis to define the characteristics of the pre-ictal phase. Furthermore, the study will consider advanced artificial neural network architectures and compare the performance of different features and methods.

Overall, the findings of this study suggest promising applications of machine learning in automated seizure detection, with potential for significant impact on clinical practice and healthcare systems.
