The internet serves as the primary source of information globally, with estimates suggesting there are between 15 to 30 billion web pages containing diverse information on a wide range of topics. However, the organization of this information is decentralized, with each independent node responsible for maintaining its own information. As a result, classifying information from web pages is a challenging task, making information retrieval a significant issue on the internet. Search engines are widely utilized to address this problem.

Surprisingly, the scientific community has paid little attention to this problem, and there are currently no tools available to effectively filter the information from a single web page. This study introduces a method for extracting pertinent information from a web page through a filtering process. In this approach, users specify a filtering criterion, such as a search term, and a new web page is automatically generated to contain only the information relevant to the filter. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first tool capable of producing a slice from any web page. The subsequent sections will detail how this approach works, provide information on its implementation and distribution, offer an example of the utility of web filtering, describe the filtering process, present the web filtering toolbar, discuss related work, and conclude with future research directions.

The filtering algorithm initially constructs a tree-like data structure that organizes all the information from the web page hierarchically in document order. This data structure serves as an object with methods for querying the tree, effectively representing the web page. The user typically only needs to specify search words, as the filters contain options that can be left unchanged with their default values. These words indicate the desired information, and the filtration technique aims to create a new web page containing nodes with information related to the specified text. This is achieved by comparing the search words with the information contained in the attributes of each node.

The size of the web page is adjusted to fit the slice; however, the original size is retained if the adapted page is larger. If an iframe's web page is larger than the area reserved for the iframe, it utilizes scrolls. To prevent unnecessary empty areas caused by scrolling, the size of iframes is reformatted to accommodate the small slice extracted from the iframe.
