The paper presents a work-in-progress that characterizes the projection of one reduction over another in the context of infinitary, left-linear, first-order rewriting using proof terms. It introduces a definition of projection and demonstrates its behavior in several cases, as well as proving a partial confluence property. The paper discusses limitations of the current characterization and suggests the incorporation of the notion of limit in the definition of projection to cover cases not currently considered.

The authors show how to obtain proper projections for cases beyond those covered by existing results, using examples to illustrate the behavior of the proposed definition. They also discuss the need to include the notion of limit in the definition of projection to cover cases not currently addressed.

The paper outlines the necessary definitions regarding infinitary rewriting and the proof term model, introduces the definition of projection, analyzes it through examples, and presents the partial confluence result. It also explores cases where the explicit mention of limits in the definition of projection cannot be avoided. Finally, the paper outlines future research directions, including extending the proposed definition to cover all projections of an infinitary reduction over another one, and delimiting the scope of the current version. It also discusses the potential extension of the soundness property expressed in proposition 5.7 to all projections.
