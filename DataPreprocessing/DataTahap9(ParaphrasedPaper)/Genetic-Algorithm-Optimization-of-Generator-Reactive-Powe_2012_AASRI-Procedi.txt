The focus of this research paper is on enhancing voltage stability in power systems through reactive power optimization. It introduces an improved genetic algorithm approach for voltage stability enhancement, which involves minimizing the maximum L-indices of load buses using control variables such as generator voltages, switchable VAR sources, and transformer tap changers. The study includes an analysis of the effects of optimization variables on generator reactive power output and provides a detailed comparison of two optimization techniques. The results from a case study on the IEEE-24 bus power system demonstrate that the genetic algorithm not only improves voltage stability but also reduces the impact on generators' reactive power output.

The expansion of generation and transmission capacities has led to voltage instability, posing challenges for power engineers in optimizing power system operations while maintaining system security and quality of supply. Operating power systems under various disturbed conditions often requires adhering to design limits, making it complex for engineers to ensure the quality and reliability of supply. Voltage instability, overloading in transmission systems, and voltage collapse are identified as major concerns for power system planning and operation engineers, necessitating improvement. Enhancing voltage profile can be achieved through the reallocation of reactive power generation and adjustments to controller parameters of transformer taps, generator exciters, and switchable VAR compensator settings. 

Gradual decreases in voltage magnitude due to increasing loads can lead to system instability. Careful monitoring and control actions are necessary when the operating point nears the voltage stability limit. The paper adopts the L-index method as a means of calculating voltage stability, where the bound on the L-index must not be violated (with a maximum limit of 1) for any node. The global indicator L, which describes the stability of the entire subsystem, is determined as the maximum of the individual L-indices. A lower L-index value close to zero indicates improved system security, while a value close to 1 signals a system nearing voltage collapse. The stability margin is calculated as the distance of L from a unit value (i.e., 1-L).
