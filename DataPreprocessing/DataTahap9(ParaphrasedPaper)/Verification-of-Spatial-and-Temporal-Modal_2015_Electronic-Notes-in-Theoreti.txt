In the last ten years, various computational frameworks have been developed to model different aspects of biological systems. However, currently, there is no single formalism that can model reaction systems incorporating both time and space, while also expressing and proving properties dependent on both temporal and spatial locations. Typically, a formalism and a language are used for modeling and specifying a biological system, while another formalism is used to express and prove properties of interest, such as temporal logic and model checking.

Another notable characteristic is that the Constraint Constraint Programming (CCP) framework can handle partial information, where constraints provide information about system variables (e.g., x > 42) without determining their specific values. This allows for a compact representation of the system state and is particularly useful when components of the system are not fully specified or when there is insufficient quantitative information about them.

In previous work, the non-deterministic temporal extension of CCP, called the ntcc calculus, was used to represent reaction rules in biological systems. This language enabled modeling of discrete-time biological systems, where reactions occur over time. Subsequently, a modeling strategy based on ntcc was described, where an abstract model was refined with additional details based on experimentation or abstract assumptions. Spatial distributions in biochemical reactions were then modeled in a subsequent work.

This paper addresses the challenge of specifying and verifying properties of biochemical systems that exhibit both temporal and spatial modalities simultaneously. To address this, the proposed systems are encoded as formulas in linear logic with subexponentials (SELL). This logical framework allows for the natural proof of relevant properties of the modeled system. Specifically, two types of subexponentials are used to represent the temporal and spatial dimensions, enabling the modeling of biochemical systems where reactions depend on the location of reactants and the duration of interactions. The paper demonstrates the expressive power of this framework by encoding p-systems, a general model of computation inspired by cell structures. The logical characterization of p-systems is shown to be highly adequate, with derivations in the logical system following precisely the rules defined for the modeled system. Furthermore, the underlying logic is utilized to express and prove properties of interest involving temporal and spatial modalities.

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 revisits some concepts about subexponentials in linear logic; Section 3 defines an encoding of biochemical reactions that considers spatial and temporal modalities; Section 4 demonstrates the use of the underlying logic for expressing properties of the system and how to encode p-systems as SELL specifications; and Section 5 discusses related work and concludes the paper. Detailed proofs of the results presented can be found in the companion technical report, as well as an application of the framework in the context of the tweak-fn14 cell signaling pathway.

The paper concludes with a discussion on related work, highlighting works that address temporal properties of biochemical systems, using statistical model checking for system property verification, and expressing spatial and temporal modalities in different biological models.
