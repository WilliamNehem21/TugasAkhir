With the increasing prevalence of digital signals and systems and the availability of time resources, discrete-time systems have become more prominent in comparison to analog systems for control and analysis purposes. However, the study and analysis of higher-order systems in their original form can be challenging, necessitating the reduction of their order for easier handling. Techniques for order reduction, as documented in various literature sources, demonstrate the progression from continuous-time domain to the discrete-time domain, for both non-interval and interval systems. These methods include Pade approximation, balanced truncation, direct truncation, and aggregation. Notably, algorithms such as Routh approximation, which are applicable in the continuous-time domain, do not directly translate to the discrete-time domain. Numerous algorithms based on Routh approximation are outlined in the literature. Consequently, there is a need for a suitable discretization technique for transferring between discrete-time and continuous-time systems, allowing for ease of computation. Specifically, this transformation involves modifying the discrete-time system into a continuous-time system, applying the order reduction methodology, and finally, achieving the desired reduced model in the discrete-time domain through an appropriate inverse transformation.
