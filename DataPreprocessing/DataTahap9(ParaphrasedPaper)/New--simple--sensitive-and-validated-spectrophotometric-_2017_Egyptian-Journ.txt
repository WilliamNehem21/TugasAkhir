Estimated. In contrast, Salem developed several techniques to estimate the presence of sham using atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS) and spectrophotometry. The AAS method involves precipitating the [Cu(NH3)4]2+-sham complex with an excess of [Cu(NH3)4]2+ in a solution of sham. The supernatant layer is then analyzed for Cu2+ ions using AAS. The spectrophotometric technique relies on measuring the green color produced by adding [Cu(NH3)4]2+ to a solution of sham consisting of 50% dioxane and water.

Following filtration, the filtrate was diluted to achieve the desired concentration within the linear range under study. The absorbance of sample solutions was measured, and the quantity of salicylhydroxamic acid was determined using a calibration curve. Similarly, the raw materials were prepared by transferring 100 mg of each and transferring them to 500 ml volumetric flasks. The same procedure used in preparing capsules was then followed.

The assay of salicylhydroxamic acid was validated, taking into account linearity, limit of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ), precision, accuracy, robustness, ruggedness, and specificity. The validation of these parameters was conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines Q2(R1) (ICH, 2005). The parameters investigated are outlined below.
