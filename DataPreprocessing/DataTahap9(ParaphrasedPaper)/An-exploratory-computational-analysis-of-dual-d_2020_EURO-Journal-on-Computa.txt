The authors of this research paper focused on exploring the phenomenon of dual degeneracy in linear programming (LP) solutions. They defined dual degeneracy as occurring when the corresponding dual solution is degenerate, and specifically when one of the primal non-basic variables has a reduced cost of zero. They noted that a dual degenerate optimal LP solution implies the existence of alternative optimal solutions, as each dual degenerate variable can be pivoted into the basis without changing the objective value. The paper outlined the structure of the investigation, which included the introduction of two degeneracy measures in Section 2, an analysis of degeneracy evolution during tree search in Section 3, and an evaluation of how dual degeneracy affects LP solution values in Section 4. The authors also addressed the implications of their findings on branching variable selection.

The paper made use of two measures to quantify dual degeneracy. The first measure, the degeneracy rate, counts the relative number of dual degenerate nonbasic variables. The authors explained that an increased degeneracy rate would result in a higher number of basic variables that could be pivoted out of the basis, and provided examples to illustrate this point.

The authors conducted computational experiments on a large compute cluster to analyze how instances were affected by dual degeneracy. They found that most instances exhibited some level of dual degeneracy, and the average degeneracy rate remained relatively constant during tree search. The paper also discussed the implications of dual degeneracy on the values and uncertainty of LP solutions, as well as its impact on branching strategies.

In conclusion, the paper highlighted the significance of dual degeneracy and its implications for practical applications in linear programming and optimization. The findings suggested that instances with high dual degeneracy measures often allowed many variables to take different values across various optimal LP solutions, which in turn had implications for branching strategies within MIP solvers. The authors emphasized the importance of considering dual degeneracy in the development of efficient branching rules and optimization algorithms.
