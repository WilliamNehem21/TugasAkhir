This paper examines the relationship between ordering structures on semirings and semiring-induced valuation algebras. It demonstrates that a semiring-induced valuation algebra is a complete or continuous lattice if and only if the semiring itself is a complete or continuous lattice with respect to the reverse order relation on semirings. Additionally, it investigates the compactness of semiring-induced information algebras based on the algebraic lattice properties of the dual of the semiring.

The valuation algebra proposed in prior works serves as an abstract tool for handling uncertainty and local computation. This paper identifies that various research areas, including soft constraint systems, probability potentials, and propositional logic, can be viewed as valuation algebras induced by specific semirings, and studies the ordering structures on such semiring-induced valuation algebras.

The paper recognizes the correlation between the order relation on semiring-induced valuation algebras and the addition and multiplication operations on the underlying semirings, contrasting it with the direct definition of ordering on semirings based on the addition operation. Accordingly, the paper delves into the association between ordering structures on semirings and the semiring-induced valuation algebras, filling a gap in previous research. The paper further presents the necessary and sufficient conditions for semirings to induce information algebras and constructsively demonstrates the relationship between the continuity of order relations over semirings and semiring-induced information algebras. Moreover, it aims to address the construction of semiring-induced compact information algebras, which are used in information representation. The paper then provides conditions for semirings to induce continuous or compact information algebras. 

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents fundamental concepts in the study of semiring-induced valuation algebras. Sufficient and necessary conditions for a semiring-induced valuation algebra to be an information algebra, as well as to be complete, are detailed in Section 3. Section 4 illustrates the correspondence between the continuity of order relations on semiring-induced information algebras and semirings. Finally, the paper provides a sufficient condition for semiring-induced information algebras to be compact.
