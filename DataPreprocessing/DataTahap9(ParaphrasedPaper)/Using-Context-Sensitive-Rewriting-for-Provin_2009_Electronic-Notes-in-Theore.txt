We have integrated the methods outlined in the preceding sections into the termination tool mu-term[1,22]. To assess the effectiveness of these methods, we conducted various benchmarks using examples from the 2007 termination problem database (tpdb, version 4.0) accessible at the following URL:

As a result, it appears that employing corollary 4.3 to establish innermost termination of rewriting may not be an optimal approach (at least with the specified set of examples), as we encounter a loss of some examples due to a replacement map that is overly restrictive, while the average time remains unchanged. With respect to applying these concepts to cycles, we observe improved outcomes, though no fundamental enhancement, as we still experience a loss of certain examples.
