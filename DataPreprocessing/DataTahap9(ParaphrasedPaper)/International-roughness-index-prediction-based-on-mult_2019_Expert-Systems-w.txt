In the field of transportation engineering, safety is of paramount importance, and it is essential for both public and private sectors to engage in professional scientific efforts to thoroughly understand service conditions and the dynamic changes in road roughness levels. The International Roughness Index (IRI), which was first introduced in a research project by the University of Michigan (Cebon, 1993), is used to assess the overall roughness condition of pavements by measuring the longitudinal profile of traveled roadways based on vehicle vibration. One of the widely used units for measuring the IRI is the "m/km." Thus, the study proposes the investigation of fuzzy time-series methods to address the existing gaps in literature regarding intelligent IRI predictions. Such methods have previously been successfully applied in various fields such as stock and weather predictions, providing valuable reference points for IRI prediction research.

Given the aforementioned background, this study aims to develop an innovative IRI prediction approach based on fuzzy time-series analysis. To achieve this, multifactor and multigranularity analyses are considered for time-series forecasting. The study proposes the adoption of automatic clustering technique (ACT) to generate a series interval within each granular space, along with the introduction of a second-order fuzzy-trend matrix (SFTM) and fuzzy-trend relationship classification (FTRC) method to forecast the fuzzy-trend of each factor. The states of fuzzy-trend for multiple granular spaces are then generated, while considering various uncertainties. Subsequently, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique is employed to forecast the optimal IRI value, and comparative experiments are conducted to assess the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Fuzzy time-series analysis, developed by Song and Chissom (1993), has been a significant breakthrough and has been subsequently studied for optimization and application in various works. One of the main aspects of granular computing (GRC) is based on three fundamental notions: granules, granular space, and hierarchy structures. Granules are specific unit elements distributed within granular spaces, which can include both father and child granular spaces, and the hierarchy of multiple granular spaces can be used to model multifactor and multiscale organized datasets effectively.

In this study, each IRI measurement factor is considered as an individual granule, and three granular spaces are defined to model three IRI factors. The PSO algorithm, which simulates the migration and clustering behavior during bird foraging, is utilized for its global random search capability and has been proven to be significantly effective in solving various types of problems. Therefore, the decision to use PSO in this research is based on its intelligent nature, its potential effectiveness when combined with other methods for solving complex optimization problems, and its proven track record in solving diverse problems.

The proposed multigranularity fuzzy time-series method for IRI prediction is evaluated using experiments conducted on original IRI data extracted from the LTTP database. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in considering multiple factors and provide more reliable predictions compared to traditional methods. Additionally, the model was applied to the section Florida 3804, and the prediction errors were compared to those of other methods, with the proposed method exhibiting the smallest root mean square error (RMSE) and relative error (RE) values.

In conclusion, the study presents an innovative approach for IRI prediction that leverages fuzzy time-series analysis, multigranularity modeling, and particle swarm optimization. The findings of the study contribute to the advancement of intelligent IRI prediction methods and have significant implications for improving road safety and maintenance practices.
