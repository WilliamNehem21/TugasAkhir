Certain types of Gibbs distributions have been shown to be recoverable using algorithms that reconstruct an unknown image, which is a representative sample from the distribution, from the image's projections and the distribution's parameter values. However, in practical applications, these parameter values are typically unknown, while typical images from the application domain are usually available. This paper addresses the challenge of estimating the parameters from sample images in order to facilitate image reconstruction.

The remainder of this introduction section presents a mathematical formalization of the concepts introduced, focusing on both Gibbs distribution parameter estimation and binary tomography. Section 2 discusses strategies for reducing the number of parameters to be estimated for Gibbs priors. Section 3 provides examples of images modeled by Gibbs distributions and their reconstructions from three projections. It also describes the Metropolis algorithm, which generates random samples from a distribution and can be adapted to find images that closely fit the projections and have high probabilities according to the Gibbs distribution. Section 4 outlines three published methods for parameter estimation. After parameter estimation, Section 5 employs the squared norm to evaluate the success of the estimation process. In Section 6, the estimated Gibbs priors are evaluated for their utility in binary tomography. Finally, Section 7 presents the paper's conclusions.

To demonstrate the utility of modeling images using Gibbs distributions in binary tomography, consider the task of reconstructing a binary image from its horizontal, vertical, and one of the two principal diagonal projections, assuming that the image is a sample from a known Gibbs distribution. If the image is viewed as a matrix of 0 and 1 entries, the row and column sums of the matrix correspond to the horizontal and vertical projections of the image. The inputs to the reconstruction problem are the three projections of the image and the parameters defining the assumed Gibbs distribution from which the image is sampled.

Additionally, examples of images with parameters (1.2, 0.52, 0.2) and (1.2, 1.2, 1.2, 0.52, 0.6) are provided, highlighting the impact of parameter changes on the images. Notably, the top-right image differs from the top-left image due to a change in only one parameter, resulting in a higher probability of occurrence according to the Gibbs distribution.
