For precise definitions of concepts such as pseudo-monad and pseudo-algebra, readers are referred to the relevant sources. These concepts are slightly more complex than those associated with 2-monads, which are in turn slightly more complex than those associated with regular monads. Two main examples are given to illustrate these concepts.

One example, labeled as 3.1, involves the pseudo-monad tfp on the category of small categories with finite products. The 2-category ps-tfp-alg consists of objects represented by small categories with finite products, morphisms represented by functors that preserve finite products up to coherent isomorphism, and 2-cells represented by all natural transformations. Therefore, ps-tfp-alg is equivalent to the 2-category fp, and the category tfp(c) represents the free object.

Another example, labeled as 3.2, addresses the absence of an interesting pseudo-monad on the category of cocomplete categories due to size constraints. Notably, small cocomplete categories are necessarily preorders, and the free large cocomplete category on a small category does not belong to the category of small categories. However, established techniques can handle this issue, allowing us to disregard it. Assuming this, a pseudo-monad tcoc for cocomplete categories can be defined. For any small category c, the category tcoc(c) is given by the presheaf category [cop, set].

For an exact definition of a pseudo-distributive law between pseudo-monads, readers are also referred to the relevant sources. Similar to the previous concepts, these laws are slightly more complex than regular distributive laws, with the main complexity residing in coherence details. An example is given in reference [27, 28, 29].

The significance of the signature in example 3.11 appears to be minimal in terms of computational impact. However, a positive theorem is discussed, asserting that any signature yields initial algebra semantics. As a result, including uninteresting examples in this result is deemed inconsequential.

The treatment of binding is described as more intricate than that of Fiore et al. Specifically, their restriction from [inj, set] to the full subcategory of functors that preserve pullbacks enabled them to sensibly discuss the support of a bound term. This concept can be analyzed in relation to the axiomatization presented in section 3.
