Until very recently, no evidence of the strong normalization of the cut-elimination process was available for full logic. In their paper, P. De Groote proved this for classical propositional natural deduction by using the cps-transformation, while R. David and collaborators presented a direct syntactical proof of the same result. Additionally, R. Matthes recently discovered another semantical proof. The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 offers an introduction to the typed system and the associated cut-elimination process. Section 3 defines the semantics of realisability and proves the correctness theorem. Lastly, in section 4, the authors present some applications of this significant result.
