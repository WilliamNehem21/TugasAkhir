Molecular docking is a key tool in structure-based drug discovery, and deep graph learning has proven to be effective in this area due to the natural representation of molecules as graphs, consisting of nodes and edges. This paper provides an overview of deep graph learning methods used in molecular docking and discusses potential avenues for future development. It introduces the concept of graphs as a data structure and explains their application in molecular docking.

The representation of proteins as meshes on surfaces, combined with graph structures, encodes chemical properties at various levels, such as shape index, atom type, distance, and bond type. While existing docking software may lack competitiveness without further refinement, the use of diffusion generative models in deep graph learning, such as diffdock, has shown promise in improving the speed and accuracy of docking processes. These models learn a distribution over ligand poses conditioned on the protein structure and incorporate confidence scoring for the generated poses.

Despite the advancements in deep graph learning models for molecular docking, there are still challenges to be addressed. Many existing models have been tested on datasets where the protein is treated as a rigid body, and the impact of flexibility in the models has not been thoroughly studied. The graph representations often include edge features to implicitly describe the flexibility of proteins and ligands, but a detailed investigation into the influence of this flexibility on the models is required.
