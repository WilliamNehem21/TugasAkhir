Focusing, proposed by Andreoli, is a method for proof search that organizes rules with similar structural properties, such as invertibility, into groups to constrain proofs. The completeness of focusing ensures that if a formula has a proof, then it also has a focused proof.

In terms of induction measures, although less stringent measures for the height of derivations can be utilized, we have chosen to adhere closely to the induction measures employed in the proofs of cut-elimination and the completeness of focusing in previous work. As a result, our proofs closely mirror the procedures outlined in the existing literature.

All types described in section sec_lexp are parameterized by the type t. Consequently, the type of "top," for instance, is not simply "lexp," but rather "forall t: type, lexp t," meaning that for any type t, the expression "top t" is of type "lexp t" (e.g., "top nat: lexp nat"). It is crucial that the definition of linear logic formulas remains independent of t and does not permit pattern matching on terms of type t. Therefore, the type lexp of linear logic formulas is defined over all types t, making it a dependent type. The same principle applies to atoms and terms.

The base case occurs when w= h= 0. The cut-formula is either one of the units or an atomic proposition. Additionally, since h= 0, both premises are either the initial rule or t, and we have grouped these cases in the following theorem.
