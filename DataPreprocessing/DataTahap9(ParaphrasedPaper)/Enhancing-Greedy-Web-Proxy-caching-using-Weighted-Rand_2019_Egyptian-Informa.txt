The main goal of this research is to enhance the efficiency of greedy web proxy caching algorithms by integrating web user clustering and a data mining classifier model based on random indexing methods and weight assignment policy mechanisms. The paper comprises sections that discuss traditional greedy web proxy caching algorithms, data mining-based web caching methods, the overall working model for the web proxy caching system, and the performance evaluation used in clustering and classification.

Furthermore, the study introduces the KORA (Khalid Obaidat Replacement Algorithm) as a method to improve web cache performance by employing a neural network to identify transient and shadow cache lines. The KORA algorithm demonstrates superior performance compared to conventional algorithms, resulting in a lower miss ratio. The paper also delves into an adaptive web cache access predictor technique using back-propagation neural network (BPNN) to enhance web caching performance by predicting the most likely re-accessed objects. Additionally, it discusses a non-linear model utilizing object features to analyze web cache optimization with a multilayer perceptron (MLP) network and to predict the value of the object based on the syntactic features of the HTML document. The Neural Network Proxy Cache Replacement (NNPCR) method is also explained, and it involves using back-propagation to adjust the weight factors in the network and select objects for replacement based on the ratings returned by the BPNN.

The paper further explores the application of the k-nearest neighbor classifier, a supervised machine learning algorithm based on distance measures, in various contexts, including the extraction of clean entries from a training dataset. The study also details an empirical investigation in which 800 web pages were visited, with 600 being accessed more than ten times. The total session count was 24,000, reduced to 12,000 with a session duration threshold limited to 30 minutes. The page duration threshold was set at 10 minutes, resulting in the identification of 12,500 page durations within a session.

Additionally, the study entails the simulation of the web proxy cache algorithm using a window-based cache simulator for integrating the data mining classifier model (KNN). The results obtained from the classifier are utilized as input to the web proxy cache simulator. The experimental setup involves parameters such as trace file name, cache size, replacement scheme, and content type. The trace file includes attributes like timestamp, URL-ID, and object size, while the cache size varies from 5% to 45% of the maximal volume of the cached content, with different replacement schemes used, such as GDS, GDSF, and GD*.
