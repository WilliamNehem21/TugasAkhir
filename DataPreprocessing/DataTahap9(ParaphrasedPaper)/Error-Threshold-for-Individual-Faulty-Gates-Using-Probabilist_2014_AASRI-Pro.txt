Section 2 introduces the concept of probabilistic transfer matrix (PTM), while Section 3 demonstrates its application in determining the precise error threshold for individual faulty gates. Section 4 presents extensive simulation results and discussion, and Section 5 provides the conclusion.

The growing significance of reliability in the design of nanotechnology-based circuits has led to the development of various computational approaches for assessing their reliability. This paper briefly introduces an analytical method based on PTM for deriving accurate error thresholds in general probabilistic computations. The attainment of exact error thresholds for faulty gates holds substantial importance in the design of nano-based circuit systems, as it establishes precise limits beyond which reliable calculations cannot be achieved.
