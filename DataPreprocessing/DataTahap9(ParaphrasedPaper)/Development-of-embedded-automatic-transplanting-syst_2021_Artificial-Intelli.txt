simonton (1991) created an end-effector that could control the position, velocity, and force to minimize harm to the petioles and main stem of geranium cuttings. Meanwhile, Kim et al. (1995) developed an end-effector utilizing a rack and pinion mechanism to convert rotational motion of a stepping motor into the clipping motion of a finger. In a different approach, Tai et al. (1994) utilized a machine vision system to identify unsuccessful transplanting, while they also used the same system to locate empty cells on the tray and guide healthy plugs into empty cells for re-transplanting. Additionally, Ryu et al. (2001) engineered an end-effector that could grip, hold, and release a seedling plug using a pneumatic system, and its performance was assessed by identifying empty cells in 72- and 128-cell trays with 16-days-old cucumber seedlings using a vision-based system.

To move the metering shaft back and forth, a DC motor was employed as per the program. The metering mechanism was also controlled programmatically using a microcontroller, stepper motor, and DC motor. The feed roller was designed to feed one pro-tray of seedlings at a time to the metering system. The sprocket of the ground wheel had 28 teeth and the idler shaft had a 14-teeth sprocket, resulting in a speed increase ratio of 2:1.

The idler shaft contained a sprocket with 20 teeth and the metering shaft had a 12-teeth sprocket, leading to a speed increase of approximately 1.7 times. This rotational speed was utilized to eject the plug seedling from the pro-tray into the delivery box. To maintain optimal plant-to-plant spacing, the velocity ratio between the ground wheel shaft of the feeding mechanism and the metering shaft was kept at 3.4:1.

Switches were positioned 120 mm apart from one end, and both switches were pressed with the support of a special bush attached to the metering shaft. Movements of the stepper motor activated the switches, prompting the controller to receive signals from the switchesâ€™ digital pins and provide digital output to the direction pin of the stepper motor driver. The DC motor then turned on after a delay of 1 second, and turned off after 75 milliseconds, causing the feed roller to move only in the anti-clockwise direction. The microcontroller supplied 5V DC voltage as a power supply for both drivers, while a 12V DC battery was used as the power supply for both motors and the microcontroller. 

The controller transmitted three types of signals to the driver: PWM, enable, and direction. The enable signal was used to activate or halt the motor operation; when high, it turned on the motor, and vice versa. The DC motor operated at 12V, while the Arduino provided 5V to the DC motor driver to maintain a constant speed. The controller generated PWM for controlling the motor speed and set the motor direction as clockwise or anti-clockwise. The DC motor controlled the longitudinal movement of the feed roller.

The system primarily comprised the pro-tray feed roller unit, metering unit, delivery unit, and the corresponding embedded system. The embedded system was designed to drive the metering mechanism and the mechanical system, ensuring optimum rotational speed at a 3.4:1 transmission ratio to achieve the recommended plant-to-plant spacing. Simultaneously, the seedling pro-tray feed rollers and metering shaft were driven by DC and stepper motors, respectively, to supply transverse and longitudinal movement of seedlings and eject them from the pro-tray into the furrow. The entire operation was controlled by the embedded system.

It was observed that the transplanting efficiency started to decrease beyond a speed of 2.0 km/h, with an efficiency of 90.3% at this speed, which was considered excellent. Results revealed that the transplanting percentage increased with the speed of operation up to a certain point, after which it decreased, possibly due to less proper soil covering at higher speeds.

The results indicated that the developed embedded system functioned satisfactorily with the developed program, and the test values obtained during the study could be utilized to conduct field trials to ensure its efficient functioning and further development. Optimizing the speed of operation and the angle of the pro-tray feed roller may improve the efficiency of the transplanter, and therefore, these factors should be optimized for use in the new prototype and further applications.

A system enabling singulation and optimum plant-to-plant spacing was created and tested. An embedded system-based software program was developed, the hardware design was fabricated, and it was successfully integrated with the seedling transplanter. The average values of performance parameters obtained with the developed system were found to be close to the recommended values. The results indicated that the developed system ensured optimal transplanting rate, the ability to transplant at higher speeds, singulation of seedlings, and maintenance of proper plant-to-plant spacing. The study underscored the importance of speed of operation and the angle of the pro-tray feed roller in improving the efficiency of the transplanter.
