In 2006, G. Hamrin and V. Stoltenberg-Hansen conducted a study on a particular group of continuous domains that possess an almost algebraic basis. The concept of an almost algebraic basis was pioneered by [name removed]. The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces necessary concepts and definitions, Section 3 examines the properties of almost algebraic domains, Section 4 explores the characteristics of continuous l-domains equipped with countable, almost algebraic, and m-closed bases, as well as the function spaces within them, and Section 5 presents a Cartesian closed category of continuous l-domains with almost algebraic bases.

Given that the class of continuous (respectively, algebraic) l-domains also maintains closure under finite Cartesian products, the aforementioned lemma, whose detailed proof is provided in [8, 9], demonstrates that the category of continuous (respectively, algebraic) l-domains with continuous functions is Cartesian closed. Furthermore, this category represents one of the maximum Cartesian closed subcategories within continuous domains.
