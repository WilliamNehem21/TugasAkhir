The DPPH free radical activity was assessed by dissolving various concentrations of the chemical compounds in methanol to achieve final concentrations ranging from 6.25 to 200 mg/ml, and measuring the IC50 values (the concentration at which 50% inhibition of DPPH color occurs). Subsequently, 50 microliters of each sample concentration were added to 5 ml of a 0.004% methanolic solution of DPPH. The resulting solution was allowed to dry for 60 minutes in the dark, following which the absorbance was recorded at 517 nm against a blank.

We conducted cluster calculations using the DMol3 program in the Materials Studio, designed for large-scale density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The DFT semi-core pseudopotential determinations (DSPP) were performed using double numerical basis sets plus polarization (DNP) functional. The DNP basis sets are of similar quality to the 6-31G Gaussian basis sets, with Kessi and Delley hypothesizing that the DNP basis sets are significantly more accurate than Gaussian basis sets of the same size. The RPBE functional, based on the generalized gradient approximation (GGA), was chosen as the best exchange-correlation functional for accounting for the exchange and correlation effects of electrons. Geometric optimization was carried out without any symmetry restrictions.

The lower values of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy indicate weaker electron-donating ability of the molecules, while higher HOMO energy implies a stronger electron donor. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy indicated the molecule's ability to accept electrons.

In the 1H NMR spectrum of the Hg(II) complex of H2taet, the signal attributed to the (NH)B proton disappeared, with the presence of a signal at 10.49 due to the SH group. Additionally, the shift in the signal for the thiazole proton supports the coordination.
