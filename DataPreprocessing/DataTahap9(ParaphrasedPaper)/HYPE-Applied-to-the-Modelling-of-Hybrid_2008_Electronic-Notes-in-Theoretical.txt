This paper demonstrates the application of a specific process algebra to hybrid modeling using the example of the repressilator, a well-known synthetic genetic regulatory network comprising three genes (tetr, ci, and laci) and their corresponding proteins. These genes form a negative feedback loop and exhibit oscillatory behavior. The paper introduces the process algebra HYPE, its operational and hybrid semantics, and then models the repressilator using HYPE and presents various analyses. The paper also discusses related work in hybrid biological systems modeling and suggests topics for future research.

The example of a gene and the protein it produces is used to illustrate the concepts of HYPE. The modeling approach in HYPE focuses on flows, where factors such as protein production and degradation are modeled as flows with associated events and influences. The paper also discusses the use of controllers in HYPE, which impose causal and temporal constraints on the system. The formal definition of HYPE is presented, along with operational semantics that define the behavior of the controlled system.

The paper also describes the use of hybrid automata as a way to combine the information on continuous system dynamics with event conditions, allowing HYPE to serve as a front-end to a well-known formalism. Hybrid automata are dynamic systems that incorporate both discrete and continuous evolution, and they are used to model the behavior of variables evolving continuously in time subject to abrupt changes induced by discrete control events.

In summary, the paper showcases the application of process algebra for hybrid modeling, particularly in the context of genetic regulatory networks, and demonstrates the use of HYPE in modeling the repressilator and analyzing its behavior. It also outlines the formal definition of HYPE and its operational semantics, as well as its integration with hybrid automata to represent complex system dynamics.
