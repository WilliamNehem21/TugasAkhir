The paper discusses the classification of graphs in relation to total coloring using the conformable condition, and presents the results of various proofs and methods utilized in the process. Section 2 introduces operations and operators, which are then applied in Section 3 to establish a threshold for determining when an even-power cycle graph is of type 1. Section 4 outlines a framework for decomposing a power of a cycle graph into smaller power of cycle graphs. The paper concludes in Section 5, summarizing the findings and suggesting potential future directions and applications of the tools developed in this study.

The paper also notes that the conformable condition precisely characterizes type 1 complete graphs (kn) and explains that the conformable condition fails to fully characterize type 1 cycle graphs, as there exist conformable cycle graphs that are of type 2, such as the graph c7.

Additionally, the paper discusses the use of the conformable condition to classify complete graphs, particularly the type 1 graphs known as kn with n mod 2= 1. It also explains the procedures involving color swapping and adding colors to cells in matrices to aid in the classification process.
