This academic paper introduces a novel process algebra called Process Algebra with Hooks (PAH). PAH is designed to capture essential features of models of pattern formation, incorporating different layers of abstraction and ensuring their consistency through hook actions. The algebra explicitly represents geometrical space and employs a stochastic semantics based on functional rates of reactions.

Following the principles of PAH, the paper discusses the modeling of pattern formation that includes a geometrical notion of space, drawing inspiration from mathematical models of pattern formation rooted in the early work of Turing. The paper emphasizes the use of processes in PAH to represent various layers of abstraction, from biochemistry to tissue, and the synchronization of these layers via hook actions. Additionally, the paper discusses the borrowing of features from bio-PEPA, such as multi-way synchronization, functional rates, and parsimony of syntax. The paper also presents the organization of the content, including formal syntax and semantics, modeling of the biochemical layer, examples of PAH use, related work, and conclusions.

The paper provides examples to illustrate the use of PAH, such as representing the concentration level of a morphogen at a specific position in space, as well as demonstrating the relations between biochemistry and tissue. It also explains the terminology of actions and their composition, introducing the concept of extensible activities and defining the notation used in PAH.

PAH is described as a process algebra that specializes in modeling patterns arising from biochemical reactions and diffusion, and the paper highlights the provision of stochastic semantics for PAH, based on functional rates, to enable quantitative predictions of pattern formation models. Furthermore, the paper emphasizes the ability of PAH to represent different layers of abstractions, the explicit representation of geometrical space, and the association of rates with transitions for defining a stochastic version of PAH.

Overall, the paper underscores PAH's capacity to model multiple layers of abstraction with synchronizations working bottom-up, as well as its representation of geometrical space, determination of rates for transitions, and its applicability in formalizing models of pattern formation.
