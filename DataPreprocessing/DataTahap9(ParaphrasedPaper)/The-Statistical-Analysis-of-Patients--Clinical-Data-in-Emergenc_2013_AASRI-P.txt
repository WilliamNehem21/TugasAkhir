The treatment of patients with various acute illnesses, especially those in critical condition, and the management of public health emergencies present significant challenges. Currently, the deficiency in the community health care system, the absence of comprehensive clinical data, and the high patient mobility make it difficult to monitor clinical outcomes after patients leave the emergency room, creating a gap between the emergency department and specialized departments in China. 

Efforts to address these challenges include the use of hospital information systems (HIS) for the collection, preservation, and statistical analysis of clinical data. Our hospital began using HIS in 2008 to gather patient data during the treatment process using real-name registration systems, computer input, and other management methods. This study aims to analyze emergency department patient data to understand disease spectrums and guide future clinical management.

As a pivotal department in the hospital, the emergency department plays a crucial role in treating critically ill patients and managing complex and urgent situations. The increasing utilization of informatization in hospitals has led to a focus on leveraging it to enhance the discipline's advantages and the quality of medical care. A clinical analysis was conducted on patients visiting the emergency department from July 2010 to June 2011 after the implementation of an emergency doctor workstation in our hospital.

The analysis revealed a notable increase in the incidence of digestive diseases in December, January, and February, potentially attributed to two factors. First, the statistical data excluded patients with uncomplicated diarrhea, leading to a reduction in the number of recorded cases in summer and fall. Second, during the winter months, there was a greater consumption of high-fat and high-calorie foods, contributing to digestive problems. Incidences of cholecystitis and pancreatitis were significantly higher during these months, often due to uncontrolled dietary habits.

Furthermore, analysis of the data identified 19 instances of sudden death among patients brought to the emergency department within a year. The ambulance took more than 10 minutes to reach the hospital, and none of the patients received cardiopulmonary resuscitation during transport. All 19 patients were deceased upon arrival at the hospital. Notably, the clinical data showed that the mortality rate for incidents occurring prior to hospital arrival was higher than those occurring within the hospital, and these patients received less treatment before the arrival of professional medical personnel - contrary to the guidelines recommended by the American Heart Association.
