The grid theorem, originally established by Robertson and Seymour in 1986, is a fundamental tool in structural graph theory and has various applications in algorithm design for undirected graphs. A conjectured version of the grid theorem for directed graphs was proposed by Johnson et al. in 2001 and subsequently proven by Kawarabayashi and Kreutzer in 2015. Their proof demonstrates the existence of a function f(k) such that any directed graph with a directed tree-width of at least f(k) contains a cylindrical grid of size k as a butterfly minor. Furthermore, they assert that their proof can be transformed into an XP algorithm with parameter k, which can either construct a decomposition of the appropriate width or identify the claimed large cylindrical grid as a butterfly minor. In this article, we adapt certain aspects of Kawarabayashi and Kreutzer's proof and enhance the XP algorithm into an FPT algorithm.

The significance of width parameters in undirected graph applications has prompted interest in establishing analogous definitions for directed graphs. The directed tree-width of a directed graph, as introduced in previous work, quantifies its distance from being a directed acyclic graph (DAG), and an arboreal decomposition of a directed graph reveals a measure of (strong) connectivity within the original graph. The similarities between the undirected and directed cases can be understood based on this notion.

It is important to note that in certain instances, a large tree-width (and hence the existence of a large grid minor) indicates that we are dealing with a positive instance of a specific problem, such as the longest path problem. Previous work has presented a framework for generating fixed-parameter algorithms for such problems, referred to as bidimensional problems. This framework covers a range of problems including vertex cover, feedback vertex set, minimum maximal matching, dominating set, edge dominating set, and others, and is known as bidimensionality.

The concept of an irrelevant vertex, defined as a vertex whose removal does not change the solution to the problem, is pivotal. This concept leads to an iterative algorithm that reduces the problem to a smaller instance, until it satisfies conditions for tractability. The technique of irrelevant vertices has been widely employed in various problems (cf. [15, 19], for example).

The algorithm for problem P can be naively solved by examining all sets of size r in the vertex set and enumerating the strong components of the directed graph after removing these sets. Consequently, the problem is in XP. In this section, we demonstrate that it is also FPT, thereby proving Theorem 2.9.

The FPT algorithm for problem P is derived from Lemma 3.5 and Corollary 3.4. The runtime of the algorithm heavily depends on the number of partitions t that can be generated from a given set t of an instance (D, t, k, r) of problem P. This value is bounded by the k-th ordered Bell number, which counts the number of ordered partitions of a set of size k and is of the form 2^(o(k log k)).

The last lemma illustrates how to identify a large well-linked set in a directed graph D with a large directed tree-width. By following the remainder of the proof of the directed grid theorem, we can establish FPT algorithms for all the remaining steps, thereby validating Corollary 2.13.
