Many websites, such as Google, Yahoo!, and Facebook, offer free services to users while displaying advertisements. These ads are a significant source of revenue for websites, and it is crucial to optimize the placement of ads in order to maximize revenue. The revenue from web advertising has grown substantially in the 21st century, reaching $42.78 billion in 2013 and an estimated $77 billion in 2016, comprising 35% of all advertising spending. Internet advertising, including banners and mobile platforms, accounted for 31.4% of this revenue. The scheduling of advertisements plays a vital role in this multi-billion dollar industry.

This paper discusses the concept of release dates and deadlines for ads, where the release date marks the start of an ad's campaign and the deadline marks its end. The notation and concepts used in the paper are defined in Section 2, followed by the presentation of an algorithm to schedule small ads in Section 3 and a PTAS for the entire set of ads in Section 4. The results and future work are discussed in Section 5.

The paper presents a PTAS for maxspace-rd, a variation of the maxspace problem that considers release dates and deadlines. This is the first approximation scheme for this maxspace variant, addressing the question of whether the problem with a constant number of slots admits an FPTAS. Future work will explore a variant in which the value of an ad is given in the input and may be unrelated to its size, a generalization of the multiple knapsack problem.
