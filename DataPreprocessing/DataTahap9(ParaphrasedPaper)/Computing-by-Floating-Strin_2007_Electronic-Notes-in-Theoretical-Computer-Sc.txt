We propose a system inspired by biology that operates on double structures of mobile strings using rewriting rules with a biotechnological implementation, resembling DNA computations. The computational universality of this system can be directly inferred from formal language theoretical results of one of the authors. This DNA-like computational device is naturally described by a membrane system, as discussed in this paper.

Nature employs a template-driven algorithm to copy DNA strings, with a computational complexity that is linear in both time and space. In a formal context of oriented symbols and strings floating in a fluid environment, a few rules guide a bilinear duplication algorithm, where two copies of a given string are systematically obtained.

The system has the potential to implement arithmetic operations. The paper proposes a universal DNA-like system that operates on double structures of mobile strings using rewriting rules with a biotechnological implementation. This system can execute any program of a register machine and has a mechanism to switch between instructions and perform jump instructions.

The paper also presents a natural description of the DNA-like system using a membrane structure. Membrane systems, which are biologically inspired containers of floating strings, take into account the notion of compartments and evoke the computational strategies of formal grammars. Cellular compartmentalization is essential for the evolution of living organisms.

The system involves three types of operations: duplication, triplication, and division by six. These operations allow for universal computations and can simulate any program of a register machine. The system encodes numerical input on floating strings and modifies the string at each step of computation, similar to a Turing machine tape.

The system involves a set of labels representing instructions for duplications, triplications, divisions by six, and jumps, and uses rewriting rules to apply these operations in a deterministic manner. The system provides a natural representation of the computational process, similar to the operation of a Turing machine.

In summary, the proposed system is a biologically inspired computational device that operates on double structures of mobile strings. It has the potential for universal computation and can simulate any program of a register machine. The system is described using a membrane structure and incorporates concepts from formal language theory and biological systems.
