This academic paper introduces a non-standard multi-modal logic aimed at representing and reasoning about ignorance in multi-agent systems. The authors argue that the ability to reason about what agents are ignorant of is as crucial as reasoning about what they know. They provide a sound and complete axiomatization for the logic and explore its applicability by reconsidering the feasibility condition for the FIPA communication primitive of "inform."

It is widely acknowledged that modal logic offers a potential solution to these issues, with many significant approaches to modeling multi-agent systems (MAS) now being based on various modal logics.

Substantial research effort over the past two decades has focused on formalizing concepts such as knowledge and beliefs in MAS. Notably, many successful theories, such as epistemic logic and variations of the BDI model, have their roots in earlier work in AI or philosophical logic. While these theories have evolved and integrated with techniques from software engineering, it would be intriguing to explore whether MAS necessitates the use of previously unexplored concepts. The paper posits that a logic directly arising from MAS studies and applications may be applicable to the concept of ignorance.

The paper outlines the properties of ignorance in formal terms and explores a framework where ignorance is combined with the classical operator for knowledge. Furthermore, it demonstrates how the operator of ignorance can simplify the semantic definition of the communication act of "inform," as defined in FIPA semantics.

The authors also discuss the completeness of their logic and explore the relationship between their non-standard modal logic for ignorance and established epistemic logic. They argue that the technical results of the paper offer insights into the possibility of expressing other operators not traditionally defined in mainstream modal logic.

Lastly, the paper suggests potential directions for future research, including investigating the application of their work to MAS security, specifically in refining Ban logic to address security protocols in MAS by leveraging the machinery developed in their work.
