In order to utilize a proof assistant, individuals are required to install specific software, which often involves a complex installation process. For example, the installation of Isabelle, a popular proof assistant, on a Linux system necessitates the installation of a particular version of PolyML, a HOL heap, Isabelle itself, as well as ProofGeneral and one of the supported Emacs versions for accessing the prover.

However, this complexity in the installation process presents a problem, as computer scientists may prefer to stick with older installed versions of provers rather than go through the hassle of upgrading. Similarly, mathematicians might avoid computer-assisted proving altogether due to the intricate nature of the installation process.

The authors propose a solution in the form of a fast web interface that can be accessed through a web browser without the need for any installations or plugins. This interface is designed to provide uniform access to various proof assistants and their versions, and is meant to mimic the look and behavior of local interfaces to proof assistants.

The proposed solution adopts a client-server architecture with a lightweight client interpreted by the browser, an HTTP server, and asynchronous DOM modification to facilitate communication between the client and server. This approach enables the user to access different provers installed on the server, including those that may not work on the user's platform without the need for any local installations.

The architecture is not only applicable to web interfaces for proof assistants, but also to other programs that have a state, feature an undo mechanism, and utilize buffer-oriented interfaces. The authors highlight that their architecture may be applied to buffer-oriented programming languages as well.

The paper outlines the use of JavaScript and DOM manipulation, and emphasizes that the proposed architecture enables the creation of web interfaces that closely resemble state-of-the-art local interfaces without imposing any additional software requirements. The paper also discusses security, efficiency, and future work related to the proposed architecture.

In conclusion, the authors present an architecture for creating simple, lightweight, and fast web interfaces to proof assistants that does not require any additional software installation on the user's end and is therefore platform-independent. The paper also highlights potential future work to explore the compatibility of the proposed solution with the general prover interaction protocol (PGIP).
