In the area of domain theory, there is a concept of quasicontinuous domains which extend the notion of continuous domains. This paper aims to demonstrate the natural occurrence of quasicontinuous domains in connection with the powerdomains of finitely generated and compact saturated subsets. It is argued that understanding the properties of quasicontinuous domains is best approached through the lens of powerdomains, rather than comparing them primarily with the lattice of Scott-open subsets. The paper presents a characterization of domains that arise as domains of nonempty compact saturated subsets of a quasicontinuous domain.

Quasicontinuous domains, introduced by Gierz, Lawson, and Stralka, capture many fundamental aspects of continuous domains. They have recently gained increased attention due to the work of J. Goubault-Larrecq and a paper by Li and Xu.

One significant result in the study of continuous domains is their characterization by properties of their Scott topology. A directed complete partial order (dcpo) is continuous if and only if its lattice of Scott open subsets is completely distributive. Gierz, Lawson, and Stralka have characterized quasicontinuous domains by the property that their lattice of Scott-open subsets is hypercontinuous. It is noted that hypercontinuous lattices can be characterized as images of completely distributive lattices under maps preserving arbitrary meets and directed joins.

The paper contains a proof in which a Scott-closed lower set is used to demonstrate the existence of a directed subset that still meets all members of a given family. The relationship between the two statements in the proof is based on considering two different topologies on the underlying set: the topological Rudin lemma for the Alexandroff topology and the derivation from the Scott topology.
