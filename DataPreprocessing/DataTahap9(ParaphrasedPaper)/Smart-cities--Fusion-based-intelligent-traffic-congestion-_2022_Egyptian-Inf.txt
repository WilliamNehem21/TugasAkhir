The development of smart cities has been a prominent focus in the last decade, with a particular emphasis on mitigating traffic congestion. Intelligent transportation systems face challenges such as communication delays between vehicles and roadside units, maintaining smooth traffic flow, and ensuring road safety. The increasing number of vehicles on the roads has led to heightened congestion and a rise in accidents. In response, vehicular networks have introduced various innovations, including vehicular communications, navigation, and traffic control, to address these issues. Machine learning has emerged as an effective tool for uncovering insights from data without explicit programming, and it holds potential for enhancing intelligent traffic congestion control systems.

This research introduces a fusion-based intelligent traffic congestion control system for vehicular networks (FITCCS-VN) utilizing machine learning techniques to collect and manage traffic data, as well as to optimize traffic routes in smart cities. The proposed system offers drivers innovative services that allow remote monitoring of traffic flow and vehicle volume, with the intention of preemptively avoiding traffic jams. The model is designed to improve traffic flow and reduce congestion, achieving an accuracy rate of 95% and a miss rate of 5%, outperforming previous approaches.

Traffic congestion during peak hours is a critical issue, especially in urban areas with limited land resources and crowded transportation infrastructure. Machine learning, as a branch of artificial intelligence, enables systems to learn from data and make autonomous decisions, thereby enhancing the efficiency of intelligent traffic congestion control systems and reducing travel costs.

Data fusion, the process of integrating information from various sources to create a comprehensive dataset, can aid in making more informed decisions. Moreover, the fusion of decision-making data and machine learning algorithms can lead to better choices in traffic management. Several innovative approaches, such as real-time traffic management systems, vehicle traffic monitoring systems, and wireless sensor networks, have been proposed to address traffic-related issues. These systems incorporate various technologies, including data fusion, machine learning, and real-time monitoring, to improve traffic flow and congestion management.

In summary, this paper presents a fusion-based intelligent traffic congestion control system for vehicular networks utilizing machine learning techniques to address the growing challenges of traffic congestion and accidents. By providing drivers with remote monitoring capabilities and optimizing traffic routes, the proposed system seeks to alleviate traffic congestion and enhance overall traffic management in smart cities.
