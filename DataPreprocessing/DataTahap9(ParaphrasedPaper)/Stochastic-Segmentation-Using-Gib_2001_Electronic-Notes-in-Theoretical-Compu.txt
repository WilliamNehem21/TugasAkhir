In a previous study, a rapid stochastic technique for reconstructing certain types of two-dimensional binary images from projections using Gibbs priors was presented. This research introduces a stochastic segmentation method for magnetic resonance grayscale images of trabecular bone using Gibbs priors, and includes results and post-processing techniques to improve the segmentation of noisy grayscale images. 

The segmentation process involves converting a grayscale image into a binary image, with 1 representing the presence and 0 representing the absence of the object being segmented. The previous stochastic algorithm for reconstructing binary images from projections using Gibbs priors demonstrated favorable outcomes, and the current study aims to develop a segmentation algorithm using a similar approach.

Additionally, the authors were supported by various research grants, and express gratitude to the laboratory of retinal microcircuitry at the University of Pennsylvania for providing resources.

In the context of this paper, an image is defined as a rectangular two-dimensional array of pixels, with grayscale images having pixel values ranging from 0 to 255 (0 corresponding to black and 255 corresponding to white), and binary images having pixel values of either 0 or 1. The discussion of binary images employs interchangeably the terms black and 0, and white and 1.

Non-trabecular bone components, often resulting from noise in the grayscale image, require post-processing to eliminate. The output images from the segmentation algorithm often contain small connected components of both white and black pixels that need to be removed, requiring the color to be switched. The sizes of the largest 8-connected-component of white pixels and the largest 4-connected-component of black pixels are denoted as threshold-white and threshold-black, respectively, and are used to determine which components to remove.
