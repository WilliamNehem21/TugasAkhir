The way a message is viewed within a network depends on how it is transmitted: it represents the actual content in unencrypted outputs, while in each authenticated and/or encrypted output, it is a new combination of identifiers. The mapping between message formats is established through the translation of high-level principles h into their corresponding network-level forms [h]. The clauses for communication forms are presented, while the remaining clauses are defined in a similar manner. In a cryptographic system, the selected format may be achieved using a time-dependent signature for an authenticated message, and a randomized encryption for an encrypted message.

The unique index i linked to the stored copy is directly linked to the interception that produced the copy, as demonstrated in the (intercept) rule. It should be noted that, as outlined earlier, the bindings created depend on the structure and, more specifically, the confidentiality of the intercepted message. As for the other reductions, (comm) is the standard synchronization rule, while (forward) and (reply) formalize the semantics of the adversarial form!i. It is important to note that a non-authenticated message is duplicated, whereas an authenticated one is not (the stored copy is deleted).
