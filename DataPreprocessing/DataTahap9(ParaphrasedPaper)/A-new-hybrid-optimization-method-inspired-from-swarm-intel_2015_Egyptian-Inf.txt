The SSO algorithm, which draws inspiration from the collective movement of swallows and the interactions within their flock, has shown promising outcomes. This algorithm offers a metaheuristic approach that leverages the unique characteristics of swallows such as their rapid flight, hunting abilities, and intelligent social interactions. While bearing some resemblance to PSO, the SSO algorithm distinguishes itself through the use of three types of particles – explorer particles (ei), aimless particles (oi), and leader particles (li) – each with distinct roles within the group. The ei particles are responsible for exploring the problem space under the influence of various parameters, adapting new strategies, and refining them. Swallows exhibit high swarm intelligence, enabling them to fly long distances collectively and mislead potential threats, and the SSO algorithm aims to emulate these special features.

In the SSO algorithm, two types of leaders are identified: the local leader and the global leader. Particles are grouped, with each group exhibiting similar behaviors. The best particle in each group is designated as the local leader, and among these local leaders, the best one is chosen as the global leader. The particles then adjust their direction to converge based on the positions of these leaders.

The SSO algorithm offers numerous advantages over PSO and fish swarm optimization (FSO), but it also presents certain drawbacks observed during testing in different environments. One major issue is related to controlling the speed and convergence of particles, leading to instances where particles miss optimal points due to their high speed, resulting in premature convergence. The use of an adaptive inertia weight can mitigate this problem. Another challenge is the lack of a proper balance between local and global searches, leading to subpar performance in certain environments. To address these issues, a combination of fuzzy inference systems was employed in the FASSO to enhance flexibility in acceleration coefficients and mitigate the mentioned problems.

The difference input indicates the disparity between a global leader and a local leader, reflecting the overall status of a local colony and whether it is positioned favorably in relation to a global optimum. This fuzzy membership function encompasses three states: low, medium, and high.

In summary, the study discusses the design of fuzzy rules to strike a balance between local and global searches and details the strategies for addressing premature convergence and facilitating escape from local optima. Suggestions are put forward to address these shortcomings, including the introduction of an adaptive inertia weight that diminishes over time and the utilization of fuzzy control to optimize acceleration coefficients, with the aim of achieving high convergence speed and enhanced flexibility in complex environments. While the FASSO method is not heralded as the ultimate optimization approach, it is anticipated that this method will offer valuable contributions to the field.
