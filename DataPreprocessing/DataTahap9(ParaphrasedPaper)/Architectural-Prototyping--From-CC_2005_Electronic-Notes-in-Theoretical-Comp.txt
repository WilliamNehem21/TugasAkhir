In the past ten years, software architecture has become increasingly important in software engineering, marking a shift from traditional programming to the development of software based on the deployment and assembly of independent components. It has become crucial for developers to specify both the overall system structure and the interaction patterns between components. Although there are formalisms available for expressing behavior and providing the necessary computational power for reasoning about designs, there remains a lack of formal methods for deriving architectural designs on popular component platforms.

Class M implements the context for process M by declaring and grouping its two actions, but it does not fully capture its behavior. The method invocation order within class M is not explicitly defined, unlike in process M where method "coffee()" can only be performed after method "coin()" has been activated. Furthermore, in process M, the execution of "coin()" is immediately followed by a single execution of "coffee()." The existing specification does not allow multiple calls to "coin()" to precede the "coffee()" call or multiple calls to "coffee()" to follow a "coin()" insertion.

Interaction restrictions within a process are addressed in CCS by the "new" combinator, which is implemented at the prototype level using the accessibility mechanisms of the .NET platform. This involves setting the corresponding method to an internal method for every variable in the scope of a CCS restriction, instead of a public one as used in the toy example.

Two approaches are proposed to encapsulate the entire system and simplify testing: the introduction of an additional class called the system interaction class, which exposes only the system's free variables and ensures correct execution order for all assembled processes, and the use of a "buildsystem" function that relies on several auxiliary functions, with three of them serving as the building blocks for the entire automatic translator.

Regarding the .NET skeleton architecture, a two-phase procedure is required for implementation. The "buildsystem" function must be stimulated with the initial action string (in this case, the empty string), and the resulting implementation of the process specification is written to different .cs files, each implementing a process defined in the CCS specification.

When working with strings and string manipulation, a new type "shows = string -> string" was introduced to improve operations, as functional composition with "shows" maintains linear complexity in functions dealing with many string concatenations.

A protocol is introduced where every method receives a boolean value to prevent the system from entering an infinite loop when complementary actions are called. The resulting implementation is a set of skeletons that can be reused in architectural design.

Furthermore, the concept of software connectors is introduced as an abstraction to represent interaction patterns among components, with connectors mediating communication and coordination activities between components. These connectors can be specified in process algebra notation and translated to .NET skeletons.

The above discussion is based on insights from the academic paper "Formal Modeling and Analysis of Software Architecture: Components, Connectors and Events" by D. Garlan, published in Third International Summer School on Formal Methods for the Design of Computer, Communication and Software Systems: Software Architectures (SFM 2003), edited by M. Bernardo and P. Inverardi.
