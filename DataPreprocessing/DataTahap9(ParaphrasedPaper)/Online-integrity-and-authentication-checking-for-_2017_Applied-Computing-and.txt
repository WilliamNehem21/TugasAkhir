The internet presents challenges in controlling data and information. Analysis has shown potential tampering and forgery of certain words in electronic versions of the Quran available online, which may go unnoticed by the public. The unique feature of the Quran lies in its worldwide identical copies, containing 114 chapters (suras) and preserving the exact wording of all its verses and words. In response to this, a model and tool were developed and evaluated to assess the integrity of the Quran's e-versions. This involved generating metadata related to all Quranic words, preserving their counts and locations. The metadata can be leveraged, akin to hash algorithms in security, to verify the integrity of the Quranic texts when any alteration occurs, resulting in a different hash value. Several experiments were conducted to evaluate parameters and challenges affecting the automatic authentication process based on information retrieval and hashing algorithms.

Credibility and accuracy are significant concerns when obtaining information from the web due to the lack of control over the details and nature of uploaded information. This pertains to the credibility associated with the hosting website, the author of the data, and the type of information itself. Encryption and digital signatures are also vital in ensuring document control, allowing permissions to be dynamically applied even after a document has been published online.

As the Holy Quran is originally written in Arabic, there are multilingual copies available online, but translating the Quran may inadvertently alter the meaning of certain verses. Moreover, variations may exist within the same language due to intentional fraud or translation issues, raising concerns about the authenticity of the verses.

To address these challenges, the identity and integrity of the Quranic data must be periodically verified using secure hash algorithms, as even a small change in the text may render it unauthenticated. However, in the context of online Quranic documents, the traditional e-commerce model of information exchange does not apply, necessitating a different approach to ensuring authenticity without relying on private keys intended for specific recipients.

The paper details the related work in the research area in Section 2, the adopted methodology in Section 3, and the developed authentication system in Section 4. Furthermore, experiments are presented and discussed in Section 5, with the conclusion and future work outlined in Section 6.

The authors also discuss experiments conducted to evaluate the top websites used to search for Quranic verses, employing a customized crawler to collect data from Google. They also examined the impact of diacritic marks on the searching and authentication processes, using different hashing algorithms to verify the authenticity of verses with and without diacritics.

The findings suggest that not all hashing functions consistently produce the same hash values for the same text, emphasizing the need for standardized implementations for authentication purposes. While this experimentation focused on Quranic verses, the authors posit the potential application of the same principles to evaluate hadiths, acknowledging the potential challenges stemming from variations in wording within hadiths.
