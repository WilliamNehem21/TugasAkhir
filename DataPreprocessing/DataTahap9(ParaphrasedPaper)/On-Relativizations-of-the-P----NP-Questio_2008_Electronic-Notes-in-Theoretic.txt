The fundamental structure for turing machines also serves as the basis for structures such as the ordered ring of real numbers used in the context of the BSS model, where open questions like P=? NP arise. In the classical setting, T. Baker, J. Gill, and R. Solovay have developed this basic structure.

Consider the class of structures with finite signatures denoted as strucfin(u), which is represented in the form (u; a, b, d3,..., dk0; f1,..., fk1; r1,..., rk2,=) for some k0 2 and k1, k2 0.

It is important to note that while a finite signature of the structure is a sufficient condition for defining NPk-complete problems, it is not always necessary. For instance, linear rlin-machines over the reals and scalar zsc-machines over the integers, which can only perform multiplication by constants, can encode the constant factors individually, albeit lacking a universal machine (refer to [24, 13]). Despite the absence of an NPzsc-complete problem, there do exist Nprlin-complete problems.

The undecidability of the halting problem is well-established for various computational models, including Turing machines, BSS machines, and while programs on standard algebras. These undecidability results stem from the enumerability of machine codes and the examination of halting sets as explored in [5, 4, 28], respectively. For BSS machines and specific classes of BSS machines, additional halting problems have been explored in various studies.

These constructions allow for the computation of program codes for machines over k. The initial construction is limited to structures of finite signature with two constants, enabling the explicit encoding of machine programs character by character. The definitions presented in these constructions draw from previous work and are modified in line with concepts put forth by S. A. Cook, R. Karp, A. Meyer, and M. Fischer.

The constructions outlined in sections 4.1 and 4.2 are applicable to any classes of time bounds that restrict the operation of deterministic oracle machines. For instance, it is possible to construct an oracle q such that expkq/= nkqpholds when using the exponential.

This further bolsters the argument that additional oracles are not particularly useful for addressing the PK=? NPK problem for any structure k. On one hand, there are known structures k with PK/= NKP, and an oracle 0 can be defined to imply Pk0= Npk0. On the other hand, there are known structures m with Pm= Npm, and an oracle q can be defined to imply Pqm/= Nqmp.
