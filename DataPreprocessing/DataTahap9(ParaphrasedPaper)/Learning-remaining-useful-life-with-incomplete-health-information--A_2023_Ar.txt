Current research is concentrating on creating predictive maintenance methods based on the condition of batteries, which can forecast battery degradation before failure. This study explores the use of steady-state models, as seen from the proposed model, to effectively estimate the remaining useful life (RUL) of batteries. Additionally, this study expands on a previous work that introduced a similar procedure based on empirical risk minimization.

The study extends the previously referenced work by defining a specific procedure for diagnosing battery health. This updated version offers a theoretical foundation for broadening the application of this procedure to a wider range of issues, using batteries as a practical example. Notable contributions of this paper compared to the prior version include the following:

- Section 2 introduces the theoretical problem, defines the health model, and specifies strategies for selecting parameters in the presence of incomplete information. 
- Section 3 focuses on the study of battery degradation, proposing a simplified electrochemical model and implementing the methods introduced in the previous section. 
- Section 4 presents an empirical study using both real and simulated batteries. 
- Section 5 outlines the conclusions of the study, and the appendix provides additional details on battery degradation mechanisms.

The battery terminal voltage is determined by the difference between the positive and negative electrode potentials. Each electrode has a resting potential dependent on its degree of lithiation, which increases non-linearly when current flows through it.

Simulated batteries were used to validate the deterioration learning algorithm in scenarios with known outcomes, assess the fit of the proposed alternative, and compare it with other uninformed learning techniques. The method was also applied to real batteries, including a numerical analysis of battery deterioration and diagnosing the deterioration of four cells with varying aging.

A synthetic 5 Ah battery was simulated with specific electrode compositions and capacities, and details regarding their lithiation processes.

Informed learning models exhibited better mean error, with the minimin/optimistic alternative yielding the best results. The optimistic version proved robust to coarsening processes, ultimately offering better outcomes compared to the pessimistic or minimin-regret versions. 

Experiments with subsets of the training set, including charge-only, discharge-only, and combined data, were conducted within specific battery terminal voltage ranges.

The study proposes a novel model for battery health status that integrates both data and physical knowledge, accommodating imprecise information. Different subsets of the training set produce varying results, with the choice of subset crucial to the learning algorithm. Three different types of solutions have been proposed, prioritizing subsets that maximize fit (optimistic criterion), or maximize fit at the worst time instant (pessimistic criteria). The optimistic criterion was found to be preferable in health diagnosis problems.

Battery degradation is commonly associated with the loss of lithium inventory (LLI) and the loss of active material (LAM), which can lead to both capacity and power fading. The study identifies various forms of LAM specific to the electrodes and their degree of lithiation, along with other effects such as increased electrode resistance and reduced reaction rates between electrodes and lithium ions, which can limit energy extraction.
