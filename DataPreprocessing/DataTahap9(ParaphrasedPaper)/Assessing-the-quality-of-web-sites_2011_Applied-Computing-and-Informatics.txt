This paper provides a review of the latest methods used to evaluate the quality of various e-business services and proposes a general framework for assessing the quality of any website, irrespective of the type of service it provides. The framework identifies key dimensions including content quality, design quality, organization quality, and user-friendly quality, along with comprehensive indicators and a checklist that can be used by web designers and developers to enhance the quality of websites and improve the image of organizations on the internet.

The internet has not only driven global economics but also transformed societies into knowledge-based economies. Recent advancements in information and communication technologies have facilitated firms in offering higher quality services, lowering prices for customers, and increasing business profit margins. The internet has created a new business environment, enabling companies to conduct their entire set of business processes and practices online. E-business, conducted over an internet-based, computer-mediated network, encompasses various categories such as business-to-business (B2B), business-to-consumer (B2C), consumer-to-business (C2B), and consumer-to-consumer (C2C) transactions.

In the past decade, significant attention has been given to the design and commercial development of websites for general information seeking purposes and for electronic commerce. Website reviews have covered theoretical and scientific opinions, surveys of successful sites, and features of existing successful e-business. However, there is a lack of a standard framework or benchmark to define website effectiveness. As the reliance on web services grows, there is an increasing need to assess characteristics related to website quality and success. While various studies have focused on the quality dimensions of websites related to specific services, little research exists on the combination of these factors across different services.

This paper aims to develop a comprehensive framework for assessing the quality of websites, applicable across diverse domains. The framework integrates knowledge and experience from various sources to identify measurable features and indicators that constitute a successful website. The proposed framework can be used to compare website quality, identify areas for improvement, and provide guidance to designers and developers when creating new websites.

In conclusion, this paper presents a comprehensive framework for evaluating website quality, regardless of the type of service provided. The framework's dimensions, indicators, and checklist offer a practical tool for assessing website quality, and its application can lead to meaningful insights for website evaluation and improvement.
