This research has been inspired by conversations with Nobuko Yoshida and Daniele Varacca. The authors are thankful to Daniele Varacca for offering numerous explanations, comments, and suggestions. They also express gratitude to Martin Hyland, Emmanuel Beffara, and Pierre-Louis Curien for engaging discussions, as well as to the referees for their valuable input and feedback.

The study focuses on the application of game semantics to strategies, particularly with regard to linear strategies and event structures. When applied to linear strategies, the approach yields strategies composition in the manner introduced by Varacca and Yoshida. The interconnection between event structures and strategies is particularly evident when considering linear strategies, which align with the multiplicative-additive structure of linear logic. Linear strategies can be conceptualized as partial orders with a conflict relation, akin to event structures satisfying specific conditions, notably being confusion-free. The authors aim to view confusion-free event structures as a generalization of strategies, and the composition of such event structures as strategies composition. The paper presents a framework, allowing a unified representation of composition, with future work planned to expand on the game semantical structures.

In game semantics, program execution is depicted as an interaction between two players, referred to as proponent (p) and opponent (o). A strategy guides a player on how to respond to the counter-player's actions, ultimately leading to an interaction or play.

The article includes illustrative examples of confusion-free and non-confusion-free event structures, denoted by waved lines indicating conflict. The concept of confusion-free event structures is pivotal, as the study reduces to the examination of conflict-free event structures, and the composition of confusion-free event structures can be simplified to the composition of their slices.

The composition of event structures hinges on synchronization and enabling (reachability). Events labeled with the same action and opposite polarity are synchronized, and synchronization only occurs between enabled events. Actions are enabled only when all preceding actions have been enabled, as detailed in Section 4.2.

The authors describe the process of composition using a depiction of tokens moving through actions, emphasizing that only one action is synchronized at a time. Additionally, they relate confusion-free event structures to conflict-free event structures, and note that the behavior of the new machine introduced aligns with the previously defined LAM machine when restricted to strategies. Consequently, there exists a morphism from strategies to well-labeled event structures, preserving parallel composition.

The research also intersects with the integration of graph strategies and proof-nets. Proof-nets, a graph representation of proofs in linear logic, have been instrumental in functional programming and optimization. The authors aim to view event structures as a form of multiplicative-additive proof-nets, drawing from the technology developed for proof-nets. They intend to explore the applicability of correctness criteria from proof-nets to event structures to ensure deadlock prevention through suitable typing.
