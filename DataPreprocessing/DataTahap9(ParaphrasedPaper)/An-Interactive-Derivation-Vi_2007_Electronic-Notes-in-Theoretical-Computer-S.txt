This research introduces the interactive derivation viewer (IDV), a tool designed for rendering graphical representations of derivations written in the TPTP language. IDV offers users an interactive interface to swiftly visualize various aspects of the derivation. A distinctive feature of IDV is its capacity to present a synopsis of a derivation by identifying significant lemmas and concealing less significant intermediate formulae. IDV is available online as part of the SystemOnTPTP interface, offering convenient access through any web browser.

Various tools have been developed to enhance the comprehensibility of output from ATP systems, including graphical rendering of derivations, structuring of proofs by lemma identification, translation of resolution refutation proofs to natural deduction proofs, and full translation of proofs to natural language form. IDV reads a derivation in TPTP format, discerning between fof and cnf forms. The process of rendering involves two phases: determining the layout of the dag nodes and edges, and implementing the graphical display of the derivation dag.

The optimal x-coordinate for each node is determined using spring embedding in the fourth pass, a graph drawing technique that models a graph as a system of springs and utilizes energy minimization to space the nodes. The layout may still result in node overlaps, but the number of iterations in the spring embedding has been found to be adequate to minimize most overlaps. IDV rates the interestingness of inferred cnf formulae and hides nodes below a user-specified threshold, computed by the Agint system. The synthesis of the proof by CNF refutation involves user-defined threshold setting, interestingness rating computation, and filtration of formulae based on criteria such as surprisingness, intensity, and adaptivity.

IDV provides a strong visual representation of the derivation structure and interactive features to highlight and explore key parts of a derivation, setting it apart from existing derivation viewers. This work presents the design, implementation, deployment, and application of IDV, contributing to the understanding and visualization of derivations written in the TPTP language. (G. Sutcliffe, S.
