This research paper introduces the concept of a "type flaw attack" on a security protocol, where an honest participant is misled into interpreting a field in a message as having a type different from its intended one. The paper presents an extension of the Lysa calculus with tags attached to each field, indicating the intended types. A control flow analysis for the extended Lysa is developed to over-approximate all possible behaviors of a protocol, thereby capturing any type confusion that may occur during protocol execution. The analysis is applied to several security protocols to detect type flaw attacks.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the Lysa calculus with tags for type flaw attacks, defining both the syntax and semantics. Section 3 introduces the control flow analysis, which captures potential type mismatches. In Section 4, the analysis is demonstrated on two example protocols susceptible to type flaw attacks. Finally, Section 5 concludes with an evaluation of the approach and a comparison with related work.

The syntax of the Lysa calculus distinguishes variable occurrences by using the notation qx for variable definitions and x for variable declarations. Additionally, the paper extends the syntax of standard Lysa to accommodate types using tags to represent the types of terms, with a separate tag for each base type such as nonce and key. The paper assumes that attackers can only change the types of terms they can access, and it elaborates on the use of tags within encryptions and decryptions.

The analysis presented in the paper corresponds to an approximate type checking process, which can be used for detecting and preventing type flaw attacks. It is emphasized that once a tagged protocol process is analyzed to be free of type flaw attacks, it can be used untagged while still ensuring security, and the tags prevent fields with different types from being mixed up.

The paper also highlights the flexibility of combining tags with other security analysis techniques, such as those for checking confidentiality and freshness. Additionally, it outlines potential future work to extend the analysis to handle more complex type flaw attacks, such as those involving multiple fields in a message or more complex types of tags.
