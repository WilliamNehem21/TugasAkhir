After observing the additive structure on Kleisli homsets, we can infer the presence of monoidal structure in these Kleisli categories. However, prior to drawing this conclusion, we revisit section 3 to redefine the iterate c# of a coalgebra c using the recently uncovered sums. This re-description will be employed in the proof of theorem 5.2 to demonstrate that the resulting traced monoidal structure aligns with the coalgebraic trace.
