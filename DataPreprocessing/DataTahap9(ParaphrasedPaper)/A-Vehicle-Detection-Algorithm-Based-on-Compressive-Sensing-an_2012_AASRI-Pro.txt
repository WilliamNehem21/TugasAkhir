A critical requirement for intelligent transportation systems in the current complex traffic environment is an effective method for vehicle detection. This study addresses the limitations of traditional vehicle detection methods, such as high computational demands and poor real-time performance, by proposing an algorithm that integrates compressive sensing (CS) theories with the background subtraction method to achieve real-time vehicle detection. Additionally, the study focuses on reconstructing foreground vehicle images using the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed vehicle detection algorithm outperforms traditional methods in terms of precision, computational efficiency, and image quality.

The study employs the background subtraction method based on CS, wherein video measurements are first obtained through compressive sampling of input video images. Subsequently, background image measurements are derived from the estimated measurements, with real-time updates to account for changes in the external environment. During background subtraction, a differential threshold operation is conducted on the background model measurements and real-time video frame measurements to determine the presence of moving vehicles in the frame image. If no moving vehicles are detected, the image is discarded; otherwise, the target vehicle image is reconstructed using the OMP image reconstruction algorithm as referenced.
