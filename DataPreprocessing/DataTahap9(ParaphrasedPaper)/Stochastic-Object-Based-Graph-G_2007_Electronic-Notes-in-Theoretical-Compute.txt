Developing distributed systems is widely recognized as a challenging endeavor, as it involves addressing the complexity of concurrent systems along with considering distribution aspects. Factors such as communication latencies and the availability of nodes and services play a crucial role in determining the success of an application.

While model-checking is an important method for analysis, there is a need to assess non-functional aspects such as availability and performance early in the development process. Additionally, for certain classes of applications, it may not be feasible to guarantee specific properties, making it important to be able to associate probabilities with the fulfillment or non-fulfillment of certain properties.

Stochastic processes provide a means to model the interaction of different phenomena, each described by a distinct probability distribution. Among various stochastic processes, Markov chains have been extensively studied and applied in computer science and engineering. Markov chains, which possess the memoryless property, can be used to model discrete state stochastic processes in both continuous and discrete time. The use of exponential and geometric probability distributions ensures the memoryless property for continuous and discrete time Markov chains, respectively. The solution of a Markov chain yields the probability of each state, considering the steady-state situation.

The paper is structured as follows: the next section introduces the Object-Based Graph Grammar (OBGG) and a token ring network as a running example. Section 3 outlines the main characteristics of Stochastic Automata Networks (SAN). Section 4 proposes the extension of OBGG, while Section 5 discusses the translation from OBGG to SAN. In Section 6, the example is analyzed, and final remarks are provided in Section 7.

The specification of an object-based system is achieved using an object-based graph grammar to define the types of graphs and rules used for the specification. Object-based graphs, introduced in a previous work, play a central role in this process.

The token ring protocol is employed to manage the access of stations to a shared transmission medium in a ring topology network. The protocol involves the transmission of a special bit pattern, known as a token, from station to station in one direction, allowing only one station to transmit at a given time.

In the formalism of Stochastic Automata Networks (SAN), systems are modeled by interacting subsystems represented by automata that may behave independently or have dependencies. SAN shares the application scope of Markov chains, with the advantage of constructing models componentwise and optimizing the mathematical solution in terms of state space.

The paper introduces Stochastic Object-Based Graph Grammars (SOBGGs) over typed and attributed hypergraphs. These graphs feature edges that can connect to a finite number of vertices, and rules associated with occurrence rates allow for the derivation of a transition system semantics that yields a continuous time Markov chain.

Furthermore, a description of the behavior semantics of SOBGGs that captures the computations of the underlying OBGG is provided, without considering the stochastic behavior.

Based on the class graph and initial graph of an SOBGG, sets of automata states are constructed to build the corresponding SAN, comprising attributes of classes and parameters of messages.

The paper also details the modeling of a token ring network with four nodes, having a static topology. Additionally, it discusses future work on defining rates to represent specific network realities and on enabling the analysis of models based on SOBGG abstractions rather than on the generated SAN.

Current limitations in the analysis process are addressed, with an emphasis on enhancing the PEPS tool to allow the stochastic analysis of models with considerable size.
