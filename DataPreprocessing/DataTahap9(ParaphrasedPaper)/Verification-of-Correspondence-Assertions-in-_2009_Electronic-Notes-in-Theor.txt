In this research paper, we present a new process calculus called DBSPI (Distributed Broadcast SPI-Calculus) which is designed to model Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs). This calculus incorporates cryptographic broadcast capabilities, as well as features for handling locations and migration, where communication and migration are constrained to specific neighborhoods within the network. The syntax of the calculus explicitly includes definitions of neighborhoods, which can be dynamically extended using bound identifiers. The burgeoning interest in MANETs lies in the fact that these networks are self-organizing and do not rely on centralized service providers, leading to localized route discovery and maintenance, as well as mobile devices acting as routers and servers. However, the mobility and limited transmission range of these devices pose challenges for protocol construction, including the necessity for route discovery, multi-hop protocols, adaptation to dynamically changing topologies, and addressing issues of reliability and security. The choice of an appropriate attacker model is nontrivial, particularly within a MANET setting, with the Dolev-Yao attacker model being considered unrealistically strong due to the limited radio transmission range. Within this context, we describe a process calculus that facilitates reasoning about the authenticity properties of MANET protocols using cryptographic operations. We define an attacker model that allows for the specification of the attacker's capability, such as being limited to local communication or capable of communication across the entire network. We also provide an example regarding the mobile IP registration protocol and its implications for MANETs. Additionally, we compare our approach to related work by Sangiorgi and Mezzetti, who introduced a calculus for wireless networks, and Merro, who discussed a broadcast calculus for mobile networks, pointing out the distinctions and focusing on the higher level of abstraction addressed in our work. Furthermore, we discuss the utilization of migration as a semantic tool for joining and splitting MANETs and highlight the possibility of dynamic neighborhood extension. We also elaborate on the safety property of interest, robust safety, in the presence of an attacker, and describe the opponent model, taking into consideration the limitations imposed. Additionally, we discuss the type system and its role in capturing effects observed at different points of the protocol. Lastly, we explore the expressive power of DBSPI in comparison to CMAN, another calculus that can model cryptographic operations and broadcast communication.
