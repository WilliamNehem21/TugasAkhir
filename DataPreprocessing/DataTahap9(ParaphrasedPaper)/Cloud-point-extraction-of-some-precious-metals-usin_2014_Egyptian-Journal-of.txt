Noble metals such as palladium (Pd), silver (Ag), and gold (Au) have numerous practical applications and are present in the environment at very low levels. Due to their low abundance, highly sensitive analytical methods are required for accurate and precise measurements of these metals in real samples. Various analytical techniques, including spectrophotometry, flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS), inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES), and electrochemical methods, have been developed for this purpose.

In this study, we employed cloud point extraction (CPE) to separate and preconcentrate Pd(II), Ag(I), and Au(III) ions from aqueous solutions using Triton X-114 as a nonionic surfactant and a thioamide derivative, 4-(p-chlorophenyl)-1-(pyridin-2-yl)thiosemicarbazide (HCPTS), as the chelating agent. We systematically investigated the factors affecting the efficiency of CPE, such as pH, Triton X-114, and HCPTS concentrations. Additionally, we introduced a salting-out procedure to facilitate phase separation at room temperature. The developed CPE procedure was successfully utilized to determine the concentrations of Pd(II), Ag(I), and Au(III) ions in environmental samples following method validation.

All aqueous solutions were prepared using ultrapure water obtained from a Milli-Q water purification system. Analytical grade reagents from Sigma-Aldrich and Merck were used, and laboratory glassware was cleaned with nitric acid solution and deionized water before use. Standard solutions of Au3+ were prepared using a centrifuge to accelerate phase separation and increase the viscosity of the surfactant-rich phase. Water samples were filtered, acidified, and stored in the dark before undergoing CPE. The study also observed the effects of salt concentration on the phase separation process.

In summary, our study investigated the application of CPE for the analysis of noble metal ions in environmental samples and highlighted the importance of optimizing various parameters for efficient extraction and measurement.
