The paper discusses a novel approach to theorem proving and decision procedures for theories with recursive data structures, which are typically defined by an infinite set of axioms. The authors propose a problem reduction technique that enables the guarantee of termination for a rewrite-based inference system on such theories. They also demonstrate the effectiveness of their theorem-proving strategy in deciding satisfiability problems in combinations of these theories with other theories that are decided by the same rewrite-based approach.

In contrast to the typical verification tools that rely on specific built-in satisfiability procedures for individual theories, the approach in the paper offers a conceptually simple way to combine theories by considering the union of their presentations. This generic reasoning approach is advantageous in handling verification problems involving multiple theories. The paper introduces the notion of variable-inactive theories, which, when satisfied, ensures that the inference system terminates on a combination of theories as long as it terminates on each individual theory.

The proposed algorithm is capable of solving decision problems for various recursive data structures and can handle mutually recursive structures with multiple constructors. It employs a combination of techniques such as congruence and unification closure, as well as specialized inference rules for type completion and cycle detection. The authors present a proposition related to the modeling of sets containing selectors and discuss plans to investigate the complexity of the algorithm, particularly in improving its exponential complexity and examining the case of uninterpreted function symbols.
