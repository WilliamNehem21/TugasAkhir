In recent decades, numerous novel data models have emerged. Initially, semantic data models were created primarily as design aids, with the assumption that these models were better suited for capturing application semantics. Subsequently, certain models such as the nested relational model, object-oriented model, and object-relational model gained significant traction as standalone data models, and elements of dependency and normalization theory were applied to these advanced data models. More recently, there has been a notable research focus on semi-structured data and XML, with ongoing work on integrity constraints in the context of XML. A key challenge is to develop dependency theories, or even better, a unified theory, for these advanced data models. Regarding a specific application, a database designer may wish to specify the following constraints: 

1. The relation product(item, custname) represents an item along with the name of the customer who purchased it. 
2. The attribute total indicates the total price of sales.
3. The attribute nord denotes the total number of orders.
4. The attribute nprod represents the total number of products.
5. The attribute nship denotes the total number of shippings.

These constraints are considered reasonable within the context of database design for this application.
