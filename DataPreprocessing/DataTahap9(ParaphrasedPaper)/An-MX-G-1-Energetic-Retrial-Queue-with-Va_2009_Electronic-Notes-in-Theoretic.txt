The model involving a vacationing server, which can be turned off and take a random-length break when the system is empty, has been extensively researched in the literature, particularly in the context of production systems. When the accumulation of units in the system reaches a fixed threshold or after a certain period of time, the server is turned back on. Managers have introduced vacation periods into these models to account for idle time when the server is engaged in secondary tasks such as preventive maintenance, priority jobs, battery recharge, and security actions.

For instance, in a call-terminating control system, schemes are employed to re-forward call-terminating setup messages to prevent their loss, which would hinder call setups. In this context, the vacation protocol involves cyclically forwarding messages from the paging-channel queue in a cell station to the wireless area, while retrial phenomena occur when setup messages are re-forwarded upon not receiving a response message from the network.

In another example related to paging channel overload or attacks on cellular networks, the paging channel at a base station is modeled as a queuing system with n+1 queues, where n represents the number of slots of the paging channels. The approach used here considers the vacation state as corresponding to the service of slotted traffic in the actual system, while neglecting retrial and energy parameters.

Additionally, a model with active breakdowns can be considered by neglecting breakdowns that occur when the server is idle or turned off. This can be achieved by replacing the service time distribution with the generalized service time, which includes all repair times from when a customer accesses the service until leaving the system.

Furthermore, another simplification approach involves utilizing the stochastic decomposition property (SDP), where terms correspond to well-known systems (e.g., FIFO queue), and others correspond to the effect of additional influences. Fuhrman and Cooper have described a large class of queueing models that satisfy the SDP for the queue size, and it is not surprising that such a decomposition can be exhibited for vacation and/or retrial queues, including the model under consideration.

In summary, the model with a vacationing server has practical applications in various systems and can be further analyzed using simplified approaches such as considering active breakdowns and utilizing stochastic decomposition properties.
