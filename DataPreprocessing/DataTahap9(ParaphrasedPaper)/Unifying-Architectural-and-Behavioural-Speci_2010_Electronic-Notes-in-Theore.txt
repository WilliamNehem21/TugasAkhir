This academic paper introduces a new specification language called jdc that is designed for use in the design phase of distributed components. The growing emphasis on asynchrony in distributed components necessitates new specification techniques that have not been previously addressed. The proposed approach focuses on data-flow specification, enabling reasoning about inter-component synchronizations generated by a data-driven synchronization model. The language is formally defined to support a constructive approach, allowing for the generation of behavior models that can be model-checked, as well as the generation of code skeletons with component control flow. The ultimate objective is to produce components with robust guarantees regarding their behavior.

An important aspect of this work is its focus on distributed component systems communicating through asynchronous method calls with futures, within the context of the grid component model (GCM). The GCM, a novel component model established by the European network of excellence CoreGrid, extends the fractal component model to address grid computing by incorporating a hierarchical structure with clear separation of concerns between functional and non-functional behaviors.

Another highlight of this paper is the use of futures to implicitly set synchronizations through data-flow and the transmission of results. This approach aims to provide a high-level and powerful abstraction for programmers that closely aligns with the programming model.

Rather than merely verifying the safety of existing code, the paper adopts a constructive approach to specify the system, validate the specification, and then generate Java code skeletons that adhere to the specification. The underlying formalism for interfacing with model-checkers is the Pnets formalism, and the programmer utilizes a high-level specification on top of Pnets, which is referred to as Java Distributed Components (JDC).

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses the foundations of the specification language, Section 3 illustrates how components can be described and composed using an architecture specification, Section 4 defines the black-box behavior of a component, Section 5 specifies abstractions of user types, and Section 6 explains the process of generating both behavioral models and code skeletons from the specification language.

This work aims to develop components that are safe by construction by defining the architecture, behavior, and data abstractions within the specification language. The specification language is formal enough to support the generation of behavioral models for model-checking and code skeletons that include component control code.

The paper further introduces VCE, a component editor built as an Eclipse plug-in for the GCM. VCE is designed to provide custom diagrams for architectural specification, along with validation features for verifying the design. Additionally, the paper presents collective interfaces in the GCM that offer synchronization and distribution capabilities, such as multicast and gathercast interfaces.

Overall, the paper addresses the development of JDC and VCE tools in the context of the GCM and outlines the features and architecture of VCE. Furthermore, the role of VCE in the platform is discussed, and the paper concludes with a summary and future work.
