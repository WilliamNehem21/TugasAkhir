The primary tools used for delivering agrochemicals to their intended location are flat-fan and air-induction hydraulic nozzles, which are mounted on spray booms. These nozzles are used in both ground and aerial delivery systems. When pesticides are sprayed, they initially form a liquid sheet that fans out from the nozzle and eventually breaks up into liquid drops due to instabilities. This process is known as spray atomization (Dorman, 1952).

The study of agrochemical spray drift has become increasingly important due to growing environmental concerns, legal liabilities, and the indirect costs associated with off-target effects. The size of the resulting drops significantly impacts the effectiveness of delivering the sprayed chemical to the target area, as well as the potential for off-target effects.

Experimental observations for spray patterns of multiphase emulsions are also presented and utilized for comparison and training in unsupervised learning techniques. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) models are employed in this analysis, providing a generative statistical model that explains sets of observations through unobserved groups, elucidating why certain parts of the data are similar.

Deep learning models using the same dataset are reported in Li et al. (2020). It is anticipated that averaging methods yield better overall performance if the models are uncorrelated. LDA models differ from deep learning approaches and serve as a generative statistical model that explains sets of observations through unobserved groups, elucidating why some parts of the data are similar.

Research has also been conducted on the analysis of image data, where objects in natural scenes are characterized as visual words, forming the vocabulary of natural scenes. Local regions from images are sampled and clustered using the K-means algorithm. Super-pixels are also employed to over-segment images into regions of related pixels.

Additionally, features from low-resolution images are examined, where K-means is fitted to higher-level patches, yielding a new codebook. LDA is utilized to discover topic distributions that define classes in an unsupervised manner, which in turn are used to build supervised models for classification using topic distributions.

For further insights into generalizability, the dataset is split into train and test sets by videos, and linear discriminant analysis models are employed to classify video segments. Feature vectors are also used for regression in addition to classification, with high accuracy and predictive power demonstrated.
