Hybrid automata have been developed as a formalism for representing systems in which discrete control logic interacts with a real-valued environment, allowing for mathematical proofs about their behavioral properties. While the discrete control logic is typically assumed to be silicon-based, hybrid automata do not make this presumption. They are commonly used to model embedded systems and their software across various technical engineering fields, with a focus on the dependability of such systems and formal verification of properties. Several model checkers have been created for this purpose. In addition to their formal semantics, hybrid automata offer a visually intuitive notation that can be understood with minimal formal training.

Section 4 of this paper will begin with a discussion of previous work on modeling human drivers, followed by the modeling and simulation of drivers entering a freeway. Finally, in section 5, we will provide a summary and propose potential extensions of hybrid automata to facilitate the modeling of human behavior.

A hybrid automaton serves as a model of a hybrid system, which comprises a discrete (usually controlling) component and a continuous real-valued component. Formally, a hybrid automaton is a finite automaton extended with a set of real-valued variables and various operations to modify and test these variables.

Specific parameters, such as the desired target velocity, car size, lane width, and acceleration lane length, are used to represent real-world scenarios. To achieve realistic results, these parameters should align with the specific geometry of the situation. However, for the purpose of demonstrating the feasibility of our approach in this paper, approximate values were chosen based on their perceived suitability.

To gain visual insight into our models, we developed a numerical simulator for our hybrid automaton models. This simulator can either approximate the entire state space of the automaton or conduct faster Monte Carlo approximations to estimate the expected value of the reinforcement value. The Monte Carlo approach, in particular, allows us to utilize genetic algorithms, which require the model to be executed multiple times, to search for values of unknown functions that maximize the expected reinforcement value.
