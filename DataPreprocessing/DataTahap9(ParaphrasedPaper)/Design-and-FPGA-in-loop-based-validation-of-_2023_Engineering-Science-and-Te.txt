The primary control system is divided into inner control and outer droop control loops. The inner control loop regulates the output current and voltage of distributed energy resources (DERs), while the outer droop control is responsible for ensuring accurate power-sharing among the distributed generators (DGs) and mitigating circulating current.

As previously mentioned, tertiary control focuses on economic dispatch and operational scheduling, involving coordination among interconnected multiple microgrids. Tertiary control is implemented to adjust the compensating efforts of the DGs with respect to the unbalanced voltage limits of DGs and load buses. An optimal power flow-based tertiary control using model predictive control (MPC) is proposed, and a centralized IoT-based tertiary control solution for multi-microgrids is also suggested.
