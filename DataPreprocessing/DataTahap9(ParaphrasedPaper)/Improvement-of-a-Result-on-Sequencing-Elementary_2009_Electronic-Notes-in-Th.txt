Cellular automata (CAs) are discrete dynamical systems in which, at each iteration, the individual units of a regular grid are updated simultaneously based on a local transition rule. Usually, these units (or cells) are identical finite automata arranged in a specific pattern of connections to neighboring cells, often under periodic boundary conditions. The transition rule determines the next state of each cell based on its current state and the states of its neighboring cells.
