This academic paper discusses expressions involving integers, booleans, and lists, denoted as e, b, and e, respectively. These expressions are purely dependent and independent of the heap. The paper also introduces identifiers (program variables) and resource names, with resources behaving like binary semaphores, using the standard abbreviation "with r do c" for "with r when true do c."

The proof in the paper is based on induction on proof height. It demonstrates that for each csl inference rule, if the premises have a certain property and the side conditions are met, then the conclusion also has this property. The paper provides specific details for assignment, parallel composition (requiring division), regions, and local resource blocks (requiring the selection of an appropriate decoration). The remaining rules are simpler and can be handled in a similar manner.
