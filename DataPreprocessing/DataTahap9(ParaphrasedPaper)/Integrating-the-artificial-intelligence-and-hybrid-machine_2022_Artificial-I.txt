Identifying and mapping high-risk landslide zones is a widely accepted scientific practice with the goal of providing a scientific basis for planning and development in the area. In recent years, modeling landslide susceptibility through simulation has proven effective in mitigating damages. Various environmental, geological, and hydrological factors, known as Land Cover Factors (LCFs), play a critical role in determining landslide susceptibility.

Selecting the most important LCFs from a multitude of factors is a challenging process, as standardized criteria do not exist. Different analysis techniques such as multicollinearity (MC) testing and relief-f evaluation are commonly used to identify the most influential LCFs. MC testing is employed to assess the interdependence of LCFs and to ensure the accuracy of landslide susceptibility estimations. Additionally, mathematical methods are utilized to select the significant LCFs in different regions.

In this study, specific geo-environmental factors were carefully chosen for identifying landslide hazard zones and mapping. Various techniques, including correlations, relief-f testing, information gain, probabilistic methods, and machine learning algorithms, were employed to evaluate these factors. Notably, the Random Forest (RF) model was used to assess the significant contribution of LCFs based on its findings, which revealed slope as the most influential factor and soil depth as the least influential.

To develop a reliable model, validation is crucial. In this analysis, statistical approaches such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), as well as threshold-dependent statistics including the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, proportion incorrectly classified, accuracy, and precision, were used to determine the reliability of the models.

Machine learning techniques such as Bagging and the RF model have been found to be effective in predicting landslide sensitivity and producing accurate predictions without the limitations of high-dimensional data. These models consider a range of decision trees with a mean decrease in the Gini index, and the RF model, in particular, has been valuable in evaluating the relationships between LCFs and landslide susceptibility, highlighting the significant impact of slope as a determining factor.
