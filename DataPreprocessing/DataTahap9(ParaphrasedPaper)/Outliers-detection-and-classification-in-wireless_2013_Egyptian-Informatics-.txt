In recent years, there has been a widespread deployment of wireless sensor networks to gather substantial amounts of raw sensory data. However, the main challenge lies in extracting meaningful insights from this raw data. In the context of sensor networks, there has been an increasing focus on outlier/anomaly detection, which can be utilized to eliminate noisy data, identify malfunctioning nodes, and discover significant events. This paper presents a novel approach for in-network knowledge discovery, simultaneously addressing outlier detection and data clustering. The proposed method is able to differentiate between errors caused by faulty sensors and those arising from events (potentially environmental events), by capturing spatial and temporal correlations between events observed by sensor nodes within a confined network neighborhood. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms other techniques in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.

Distinguishing between the sources of outliers is crucial, as it provides insights into how to handle the detected outliers. In the case that the detected outlier is an error or noisy data, it should be removed from the sensed data to ensure data quality and accuracy, as well as to conserve energy by reducing communication load. Conversely, if the outlier is caused by an event (e.g., fire or chemical spills), removing the outlier will result in the loss of important hidden information about events, which may have undesired consequences. However, many studies tend to treat outliers and events as similar conditions by treating events as a type of outliers. The presence of spatio-temporal correlations among neighboring node readings enables the distinction between events and errors. This is based on the observation that noisy measurements and sensor faults are likely to be stochastically unrelated, while event measurements are likely to be spatially correlated.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a literature review, followed by section 3, which introduces necessary background definitions. Section 4 presents the proposed approach and methodology, while section 5 outlines the approach for measuring sensor trustworthiness. Section 6 reports the experimental evaluation on both synthetic and real datasets, and finally, section 7 concludes the paper.

The proposed approach is introduced in detail in this section. While several outlier detection techniques have been developed, they did not take into account interesting events. Conversely, recent research has focused solely on events and neglected erroneous data. This paper proposes a new clustering-based approach combined with a nearest neighbor-based approach to classify outliers, i.e., noisy data or interesting events. To increase the accuracy of the proposed approach, historical sensor data is stored and analyzed to determine characteristics and features that define each node. This heuristic approach provides greater confidence in the decision-making process.

In this section, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated using both real and synthetic datasets. The accuracy of the algorithm is compared with another event detection method called the collect method, which is based on distributed collaboration among neighboring nodes. The accuracy and scalability of the proposed method are assessed on both real and synthetic datasets.

An experiment is conducted to evaluate the proposed approach with different values of a parameter (w) ranging from 0.5 to 3.0. The study demonstrates that the number of produced clusters (normal and outlier clusters) is greater when the width is low, as expected. Outlier detection algorithms are typically evaluated using the detection rate and false alarm rate.

The experimental evaluation shows that the proposed approach can achieve a high accuracy rate for identifying outliers, as well as effectively detecting interesting events and noisy data. For future work, the performance of the algorithm will be evaluated on a larger dataset, and the approach will be enhanced to address scenarios where events expand or disappear over time. Further studies may also explore solutions related to sensor node deployment, data dissemination, and routing in wireless sensor networks.
