The exchange rule in question specifies the transition of a bond from site 2 of molecule A to site 1 of molecule C. Bond flipping is of particular interest in modeling nanomachines, where connections between components are dynamically rearranged. Despite the apparent simplicity of these reactions, their incorporation into the spim calculus is complex when stochastic semantics must be maintained. In this paper, we will explore these challenges through a series of examples.

The reductions in the spim calculus are represented by communications on a channel. Since these reductions are constant, they will not have a significant impact on the subsequent definition 2.4 (they will be integrated into the (init) element of the definition). Therefore, we will not present the formal definition here.
