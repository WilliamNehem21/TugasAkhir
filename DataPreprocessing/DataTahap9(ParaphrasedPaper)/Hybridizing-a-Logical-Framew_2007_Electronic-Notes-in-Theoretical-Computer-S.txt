The study proposes extending the logical framework lf, which is a constructive type theory of dependent functions, with logical connectives commonly used in hybrid logic. This extension is found to be simple and preserves the usual theoretical and algorithmic properties, such as type-checking decidability. The addition of these hybrid connectives provides a rich metalanguage for encoding and reasoning about resource-sensitive substructural logics, similar to how lf serves as a metalanguage for more conventional logics.

The primary motivation behind designing this system was to create a framework for formulating linear metatheorems, particularly for encoding theorems about substructural logics into a logical framework. The addition of hybrid connectives arose naturally as the most effective means for achieving this goal and also supports other applications.

The extension is further justified by the relationship between the hybrid connectives, which is based on considerations of focused proofs, as they all exhibit right asynchronous behavior. Additionally, the proposed extension allows for invertible natural deduction introduction rules for each connective, resulting in a system where type-correctness is more explicitly evident in the terms themselves. However, it is noted that this system is not a straightforward extension of llf and may require further exploration, such as the idea of proof irrelevance, to resolve potential issues.

The ultimate aim of this work is to facilitate a more natural and efficient encoding of metatheoretic algorithms developed for lf, enabling the formal specification and mechanical verification of properties of substructural logics and languages. The authors argue that hlf provides a language for stating theorems precisely and plan to develop appropriate tools for this purpose.

The paper also discusses the use of lf and its implementation twelf for encoding logics, proving properties about them, and understanding the adaptation of coverage checking. The authors emphasize the importance of adapting coverage checking, particularly in the mechanization of proofs represented as programs that compute partial functions. Additionally, they express the intention to demonstrate a categorical semantics and to prove soundness and completeness with respect to the current system.

Overall, the paper aims to extend the logical framework lf with hybrid connectives to provide a more natural encoding for substructural logics and to develop tools for checking claims about these logics. The proposed system also aims to enable the formal specification and mechanical verification of properties of substructural logics and languages, ultimately contributing to the advancement of logical frameworks for constructive proofs and programs.
