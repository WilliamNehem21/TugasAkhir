The modification of Java applications through automatic code modification is a widely adopted technique that enhances the functionality of existing software. Aspect-oriented programming or bytecode rewriting simplifies the implementation of cross-cutting concerns like logging, error handling, or profiling without altering the original applications. However, a more intricate task is the comprehensive transformation of an application, wherein an entirely new program is created while retaining the execution semantics of the original, and incorporating significant new functionality.

The paper presents a proxy-based object model that abstracts object implementation, concealing whether they are local or remote to a specific virtual machine. This model facilitates the distribution and migration of objects across the ruggedj network while preserving the execution semantics and class hierarchy of the original application. Additionally, by referencing transformed classes in rewritten bytecode only using interfaces, the need for proxies is eliminated in cases where an object is always known to be local or remote.

The implementation of ruggedj is mostly complete, with the bytecode transformation process in place and tested on realistic applications running on a single node. The authors have successfully distributed simple applications and are currently focused on achieving complete distribution of complex systems.

The paper discusses the division of classes into instance and static parts, which is essential for ensuring that static data exists exactly once in the ruggedj network. When the ruggedj class loader has rewritten a class, it presents only the transformed version for loading into the Java VM, thereby eliminating conflicts between modified and unmodified classes.

Furthermore, the paper delves into the details of the interfaces and classes generated for different aspects of the application, such as object allocation, array operations, and handling of unmodifiable classes. It also addresses the complexities involved in transforming static methods, invokespecial bytecodes, and handling of various allocation policies.

In conclusion, while the paper acknowledges that large-scale automatic application transformation systems like ruggedj cannot guarantee correctness in all cases, it expresses confidence that such cases are rare under normal circumstances.
