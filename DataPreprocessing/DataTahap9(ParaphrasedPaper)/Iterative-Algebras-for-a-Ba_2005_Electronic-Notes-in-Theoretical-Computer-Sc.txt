The category alg(ffi,) is a complete subcategory of alg s, and it can be readily confirmed that it preserves limits and filtered colimits within alg s. Therefore, it can be considered a reflective subcategory, as stated in theorem 2.48. Since the forgetful functor of alg(ffi,) is a restriction of the forgetful functor of alg s, the proposition can be deduced.
