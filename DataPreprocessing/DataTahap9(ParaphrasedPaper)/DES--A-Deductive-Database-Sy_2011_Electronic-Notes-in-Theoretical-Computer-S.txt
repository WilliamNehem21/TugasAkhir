The combination of relational databases, logic, and artificial intelligence led to the development of deductive databases. These systems are equipped to infer information from both the intensional database, which contains deductive rules, and the extensional database, which contains facts. Datalog, a deductive database query language, has gained prominence due to its applications in ontologies, semantic web, social networks, policy languages, and optimization. Companies such as LogicBlox, Exeura, Semmle, and Lixto have adopted Datalog-based deductive database technologies in their solutions.

Compared to SQL, Datalog offers two main advantages: cleaner semantics for better problem specification reasoning and more compact formulations, especially with recursive predicates, leading to improved understanding and program maintenance. Additionally, Datalog provides greater expressivity by allowing multiple recursive calls within deductive rule bodies.

Several deductive systems have emerged over time, such as DLV, XSB, BDDDBB, LDL++, ConceptBase, and.QL, but there is a lack of a system that meets desired properties such as multi-platform support, interactivity, multi-language support, and open-source availability.

The system follows ISO Prolog standards and features an efficient Prolog engine (SICStus Prolog) with memoization techniques for enhanced efficiency. It can be used across different Prolog environments running on various platforms. 

The system supports handling unknown values, including nulls, through built-ins such as outer join operations. It also introduces autoviews, temporary views that are created without a head. Additionally, the paper proposes a debugging approach anchored to the semantic level, called declarative debugging, to debug queries and diagnose missing and incorrect answers in Datalog programs.

Furthermore, the system includes features for batch processing, logging system outputs to files, and automation capabilities for integration with other systems. However, it is not designed for handling large amounts of data or concurrent access.

Intended users of the system include students, educators, practitioners, and researchers who can benefit from learning and teaching SQL and Datalog in a shared database environment. The system's open-source nature and implementation in Prolog make it suitable for experimentation and customization.
