The nrl pump, referred to as a component in the paper, serves as a trusted intermediary device that functions as a router for transmitting messages from a system with lower security to one with higher security. It accomplishes this by monitoring the timing of acknowledgments in the reverse direction. The purpose of the nrl pump is to securely transmit information from a lower security system to a higher security system without the risk of covert channels being exploited by the higher security system to communicate with the lower security system. To achieve this, the pump decouples the acknowledgment stream while ensuring reliable communication is maintained. The paper discusses the use of statistically modulated acknowledgments to achieve this goal. The probability of the nrl pump sending an acknowledgment to the low system at a specific time, given an average acknowledgment delay time, is denoted as p(l, x). The paper mentions that there are various ways to define p(l, x), each with potential implications for security and performance. Additionally, the paper introduces an automaton called pump2, which processes message forwarding and acknowledgment from the high system, while also addressing the handling of expired connections and decision-making processes for the low system. The paper aims to estimate the probability of the observer making a correct decision within a specific time frame.
