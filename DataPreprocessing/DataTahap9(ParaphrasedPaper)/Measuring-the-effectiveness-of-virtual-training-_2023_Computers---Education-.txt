In today's world, it is nearly impossible to live without some form of virtual environment (VE) or virtual reality (VR). These technologies, which provide computer-generated displays to simulate physical environments, are crucial for enabling users to perceive, feel, and interact with their surroundings using various sensory channels, input and output devices, and simulated scenarios. Within the reality-virtuality continuum, which encompasses pure reality and pure virtuality, the space between these extremes is referred to as mixed reality (MR). Additionally, distinctions are made between augmented reality, which enhances the real world with virtual objects, and augmented virtuality, which incorporates elements of the real world into a virtual environment. While visual stimuli are frequently emphasized in placing environments on the reality-virtuality continuum, other sensory modalities such as sound, motion, haptics, flavor, and smell can also be integrated into these environments.

Numerous theories can be applied to the design of educational VEs, with two prominent theoretical frameworks being Mayer's cognitive theory of multimedia learning and the technology acceptance model. Mayer's cognitive theory of multimedia learning focuses on the reception of educational material through different modes, including delivery media, presentation modes, and sensory modalities. This theory emphasizes the learner's active role in selecting and connecting visual and verbal knowledge. Moreover, the technology acceptance model, based on the theory of reasoned action and bandura's self-efficacy theory, seeks to explain individuals' motivation to use particular technological innovations based on perceived ease of use and usefulness.

When evaluating the effectiveness of VT, various learning outcomes can be measured, such as knowledge of the learned topic and the acquisition of skills. Kirkpatrick's model of training evaluation outlines four levels of training effectiveness assessment, which can be applied to various forms of training, including vocational and educational contexts.

The review aims to provide a comprehensive summary of the current state of research on VT effectiveness. The paper also identifies methodological shortcomings in the existing literature and suggests potential areas for further research in this field. Additionally, the review proposes a framework that can guide researchers conducting studies on VT effectiveness. The paper analyzes a wide range of technology types used in various studies, categorizing them based on the reality-virtuality continuum. It also discusses the potential impact of these technologies within an educational context and highlights the need for reliable data to support the implementation of VT in specific educational domains.

Furthermore, the review emphasizes the necessity of considering power analysis in research designs and discusses potential issues related to sample sizes in empirical studies. It also stresses the importance of longitudinal designs and the need for proper description of study procedures to ensure reproducibility and effective assessment of study results. The review suggests using a combination of evaluation methods to capture unique characteristics of the studied learning methods and recommends careful selection of learning outcomes and their evaluation methods, informed by theoretical frameworks.

In conclusion, the review provides valuable insights into the methodology of research on VR-based learning effectiveness and proposes a framework that can serve as a basis for future studies in this area. The review also acknowledges its limitations and aims to offer general guidelines adaptable to various domains of research.
