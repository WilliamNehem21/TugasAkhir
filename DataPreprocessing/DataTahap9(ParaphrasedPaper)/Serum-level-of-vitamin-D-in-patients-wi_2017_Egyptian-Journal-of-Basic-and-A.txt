Methods and Subjects: The study enrolled 50 participants, including 30 patients with alopecia areata (AA) and 20 healthy controls. All patients underwent a thorough history assessment and physical examination to evaluate the pattern and severity of AA. Blood samples were obtained from all participants to conduct a complete blood count and assess serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), parathyroid hormone, random blood sugar, and calcium.

Findings: AA patients exhibited a significant reduction in serum 25(OH)D levels compared to controls. Furthermore, males with AA showed a significantly lower level of serum 25(OH)D compared to females with AA. Patients with AA also had significantly lower serum calcium levels compared to the control group. The only significant difference in the blood count was lower red blood cell counts in the AA group compared to the control group. A positive linear correlation was observed between serum vitamin D and serum calcium levels in the patient group. Additionally, a strong positive correlation was found between disease severity (salt score) and disease duration. Patients with total scalp hair loss and body hair loss had a disease duration of over six months, whereas most patients with a duration of less than six months had low salt scores.

Discussion: 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 plays a crucial role in hair follicle biology. Expression of vitamin D receptors in epidermal keratinocytes and dermal papilla cells is essential for maintaining a normal hair cycle. The absence of vitamin D receptors is associated with reduced epidermal differentiation and hair follicle growth. Patients with AA exhibited significantly lower concentrations of both 25(OH)D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, along with higher mean levels of parathyroid hormone compared to controls. Moreover, vitamin D supplementation may have a preventive role in autoimmune diseases such as AA, possibly through the activation of regulatory T cells.

Study Design: The study was a prospective case-control investigation approved by the ethics committee of the Faculty of Medicine at Mansoura University. The 50 participants, including 30 AA patients and 20 healthy controls, were selected from the outpatient clinic of the Department of Dermatology, Andrology, and STDs at Mansoura University Hospital. Informed written consent was obtained from all participants, who were from Dakahlia Governorate.

Blood Sample Analysis: Venous blood samples were collected from each participant, with one milliliter used for a complete blood count and the rest for serum separation. Levels of intact parathyroid hormone were determined using an ELISA principle, while serum 25(OH)D levels were assessed using ELISA kits. The study found that serum calcium levels were significantly lower in AA patients compared to the control group, potentially due to decreased intestinal calcium absorption in vitamin D deficiency.

Study Limitations: The study had some limitations, including a small sample size, seasonal variation in vitamin D levels, and potential methodological differences with other studies. Additionally, the rarity of AA as a disease and the high cost of investigations limited the number of cases studied. The study did not include a subgroup with vitamin D supplementation to assess its impact on disease severity and extension. Furthermore, vitamin D levels were measured only once, without considering factors such as ethnicity, skin color, or sun exposure that may bias the results.

Conclusion: Despite its limitations, the study provides valuable insights into the relationship between vitamin D levels and AA. Further research with larger sample sizes and longer durations is warranted to validate these findings.
