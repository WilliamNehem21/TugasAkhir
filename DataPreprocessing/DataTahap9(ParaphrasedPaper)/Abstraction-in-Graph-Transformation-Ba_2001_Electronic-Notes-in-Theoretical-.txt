Graph grammars and graph parsing techniques are prominently employed in defining visual languages (VLs) and building VL editors. By using a parser to analyze diagrams, the graphical interface can be treated as an extended drawing program, enabling the same front-end to be utilized for a wide range of different VLs with minimal adaptation; only the set of permitted VL symbols (such as boxes, arrows, etc.) needs to be specified. Diagrams are then constructed by drawing these symbols using "direct manipulation," and the resulting drawings are analyzed by a VL parser to verify diagram correctness and generate an abstract representation for further processing.

Integrating a parser in a VL editor offers the primary advantage of eliminating the need to define a complete set of structure-based editing operations, thereby keeping the language-specific part of the editor as compact as possible. This facilitates the use of an "editor generator" in conjunction with a class library to create editors for intricate VLs from relatively brief and concise syntax descriptions. One such editor-generator framework, Diagen, combines the parsing approach for VL editors with a transformation-oriented approach, enabling complex structure-based transformations on the edited diagrams, described as graph transformations on the diagram's internal graph model.

Internally, Diagen represents diagrams as a labeled hypergraph composed of "component" and "relation" (hyper) edges. A component edge corresponds to a visual symbol in the actual diagram, and each symbol has a number of "connector regions" where it can interact with other components. These connector regions are mapped into hypergraph nodes that the respective component hyperedge attaches to. Finally, the syntax description can define arbitrary geometric relations between the connector regions (typically containment and intersection), which are mapped into binary relation edges connecting the corresponding nodes.

In the specific example's simple case, the abstract semantic graph (ASG) is nearly identical to the refined hypergraph grammar (RHGM). Typically, the RHGM may contain additional edges that cannot be parsed correctly or groups of edges combined into a single ASG entity. Additionally, for certain UML elements, there exist multiple alternative visualizations that result in different RHGM structures, all derived from the same nonterminal type.

Various other approaches exist for generating visual language editors from a formal specification. Those based on an abstract graph model (e.g., Genged, Kogge) inherently come with "built-in" abstract representations. Conversely, tools that eschew abstract internal models (e.g., Penguins based on constraint multiset grammars) lack immediate access to abstract models and must instead explicitly create external diagram representations through attribute evaluation.
