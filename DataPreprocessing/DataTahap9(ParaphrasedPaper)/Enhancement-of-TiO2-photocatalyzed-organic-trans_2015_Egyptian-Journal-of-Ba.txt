The photocatalytic process involving TiO2 anatase facilitates the conversion of diphenylamine (DPA) to N-phenyl-p-benzoquinonimine (PBQ) in ethanol through oxidative means. The formation of PBQ increases with higher concentrations of DPA, increased TiO2 loading, greater airflow rate, and higher light intensity. Notably, the catalyzed formation of PBQ is more pronounced when exposed to UV-C light compared to UV-A light. Furthermore, the catalyst is reusable. The study also presents a proposed mechanism for the photocatalytic reaction and puts forth deduced kinetic parameters. Additionally, the study suggests that ZnO and ZnS enhance the TiO2-photocatalyzed DPA oxidation, pointing to interparticle charge transfer in mixed semiconductors.

The use of semiconductor photocatalysis for environmental remediation has been widely researched, and there are also reports on its application for selective organic transformations. TiO2 is a commonly used photocatalyst for these applications. Upon band gap excitation, TiO2 generates electron-hole pairs, leading to the production of reactive oxidizing species (ROS) in the presence of moisture and air. Specifically, the holes in the valence band (VB) oxidize water molecules and hydroxide ions adsorbed on the TiO2 surface to produce hydroxyl radicals. In non-aqueous media, the hole in the VB directly oxidizes the adsorbed substrate. TiO2 exhibits selective oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes or ketones, and functionalized nitroarenes are selectively reduced by N-doped TiO2. Propene and cyclopentene can be transformed into their corresponding epoxides using TiO2/SiO2 as a photocatalyst. Furthermore, TiO2 Degussa P25 selectively catalyzes the oxidation of benzyl amines to the corresponding imines, with the production of significant amounts of aldehydes.

In the experimental setup, fresh ethanol was placed in wide cylindrical glass vessels, with the catalyst powder covering the entire vessel bottom. Air was bubbled using a micro pump without disturbing the catalyst bed, and the volume of the DPA solution was 25 ml, with periodic compensation for solvent loss due to evaporation. Spectrophotometric estimation was used to measure the formed PBQ. Solar experiments were conducted under standardized conditions to enable accurate comparison of the results. The study found that high catalyst loading may not lead to a linear dependency of photocatalytic reaction on illumination intensity, as the surface area exposed to light may not correlate with the catalyst weight.

The study also indicated that charge separation and improved photocatalytic efficiency are possible through the use of coupled semiconductors, with examples of enhanced photocatalytic transformation observed on mixing ZnO or ZnS powder with TiO2 powder. However, the observation of enhanced photocatalytic transformation at a 50% wt. composition for the semiconductor mixtures was not realized, possibly due to differences in densities, particle sizes, and aggregation of the semiconductors.
