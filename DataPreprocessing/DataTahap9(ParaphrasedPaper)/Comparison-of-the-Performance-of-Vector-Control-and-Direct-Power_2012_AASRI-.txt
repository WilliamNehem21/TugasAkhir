The traditional method for independently controlling active and reactive powers in a machine is stator flux-oriented vector control with rotor position sensors, where the system's performance relies on the accuracy of stator flux computation and the precision of rotor position information obtained from the position encoder. However, aligning the position sensor in a doubly-fed wound rotor machine is challenging.

On the other hand, direct power control of the doubly-fed induction generator can regulate the active and reactive powers of a wound rotor induction generator without relying on rotor position sensors. This approach enables decoupled control of stator active and reactive power and exhibits strong dynamic response, as demonstrated in simulation results. Since it only depends on voltage and current measurements on the stator side, it is less sensitive to machine parameters. Direct power control offers advantages over vector control, as the settling time and peak overshoot in the vector control scheme are higher than those in the direct power control scheme.

Furthermore, the direct power control of the generator has been integrated into an optimal power controller for maximizing energy capture in a wind energy application. Additionally, pitch angle control of the wind turbine is implemented to restrict the generator speed at higher wind speeds, ensuring satisfactory performance even under challenging conditions.
