Agriculture is a complex field of study that encompasses a wide range of interconnected concepts and relationships. Effectively modeling these concepts is crucial for extracting important domain knowledge from the complex agricultural system. Concept modeling is essential for supporting distributed information retrieval, analogy inference, and data mining based on the agricultural knowledge system. Ontology, as a classical knowledge theory, can be utilized to address the challenge of presenting agricultural knowledge.

The attribute of agricultural ontology (AO) is utilized to define the concept of agriculture ontology, serving to limit concepts and provide examples. This attribute can be derived from various sources of knowledge. For instance, crops belong to the plant category and inherit related plant properties such as genetic properties, shape and structure, distribution, and others. Additionally, crops have their own unique property class, such as growth environment properties comprising weather and other growing conditions. Each property class includes multiple properties, allowing for a comprehensive description of the crop. To facilitate the management of ontology and capture the hierarchical relationships among properties, we describe the properties and relationships as a unified ontology system, referred to as crop property ontology.

Once the agriculture ontology and knowledge base have been established, an important subsequent task involves checking and reasoning on the knowledge. However, this process relies on the existing ontology and necessitates the construction of a consistent axiom base.
