In their work, Fajstrup, Goubault, and Raussen introduced local pospaces as a conceptual framework for representing concurrent systems. They demonstrated that the category of local pospaces with a fixed local pospace conforms to the notion of a fibration category according to H. Baues. Within this fibration category, the concept of relative directed homotopy is defined.

Recent use of homotopy theory has proven successful in addressing issues within concurrency theory, a subfield of theoretical computer science concerned with parallel computing. To describe concurrent systems, various topological models such as partially ordered spaces (pospaces), local pospaces, flows, globular CW-complexes, and D-spaces have been proposed. For further exploration of these topological models, readers are encouraged to refer to E. Goubault's comprehensive survey. This paper focuses specifically on investigating the homotopy theory, particularly the relative directed homotopy theory, of local pospaces.

It is demonstrated that the category of pospaces (with a partial order that may not be closed) under a fixed pospace behaves as both a fibration and a cofibration category. However, it remains uncertain whether the category of local pospaces under a fixed local pospace also constitutes a cofibration category. A key obstacle is the unresolved question of whether the category of local pospaces possesses sufficient colimits. Noteworthy in this context is the work of P. Bubenik and K. Worytkiewicz, who have established a closed model category encompassing the category of local pospaces (in its initial sense) under a fixed local pospace as a subcategory.
