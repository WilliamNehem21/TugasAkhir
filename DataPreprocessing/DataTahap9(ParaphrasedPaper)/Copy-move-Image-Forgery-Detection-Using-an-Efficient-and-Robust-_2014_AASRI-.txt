In today's digital era, digital images and videos are primary mediums for conveying information. However, these sources of information are susceptible to tampering using easily accessible software, raising concerns about the authenticity and integrity of digital images. One prevalent method of tampering is copy-move image forgery. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach for detecting copy-move forgery by leveraging a combination of dyadic wavelet transform (DYWT) and scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) to withstand various pre-processing attacks. In our method, we first apply DYWT to decompose the given image into four parts: LL, LH, HL, and HH. Since the LL part contains the majority of the information, we apply SIFT to extract key features and generate a descriptor vector. By comparing the similarity between different descriptor vectors, we can determine if copy-move tampering has occurred. Our approach allows for more efficient detection of copy-move forgery by extracting a higher number of matched key points using DYWT in conjunction with SIFT.

The subsequent sections of the paper are organized as follows: the next section reviews previous work related to image forgery detection, Section 3 elaborates on our proposed method, Section 4 presents simulation results and performance evaluations, and the conclusion and references are provided at the end. Additionally, we offer recommendations for future research.

Previous research by Mahalakshmi et al. focused on detecting digital image forgery by examining basic image manipulations such as copy-move, region duplication, and splicing. Anand et al. proposed an algorithm using SIFT and DYWT methods to detect digital image copy-move forgery and mitigate sustained attacks.

Our work proposes a new technique for copy-move forgery detection by transforming the image into the wavelet domain and applying SIFT to extract features. Leveraging the multispectral components produced by wavelet transforms enhances the prominence of features. We then match interest point feature descriptors to ascertain whether tampering has occurred. Our findings confirm the effectiveness of SIFT features due to their high computational efficiency and robust performance.

We introduced DYWT to address the limitations of DWT, as DYWT is shift-invariant and does not involve down-sampling like DWT. The DYWT of an image is computed using a specific algorithm.
