Currently, there is a strong global focus on the development of the smart grid, with both Europe and the United States considering it a crucial component of their national strategies. In China, the State Grid Corporation has introduced the concept of a "strong intelligent grid" and has laid out a three-step strategic plan to fully implement this concept by 2020. The smart grid represents an innovative approach to transmission and distribution.

The conventional method of integrating Automatic Voltage Control (AVC) and Energy Management Systems (EMS) utilizes a plug-AVC model, which requires interfaces with the EMS to realize the model of AVC and data acquisition. However, this approach imposes a significant workload on maintenance staff, as they must maintain two separate systems, resulting in inefficiency and duplicated labor. An alternative embedded method also presents drawbacks, including dependence on API functions for data reading from the EMS manufacturers' Goodway package, and potential security risks associated with granting high-level database permissions within the EMS system.

The objective function of minimizing voltage offset entails reducing the sum of voltage discrepancies at each node from the ideal voltage value range, aiming to elevate voltage levels at load nodes. This can be mathematically expressed as an optimization problem.

The inference engine is a critical component of expert systems, employing knowledge reasoning to derive results from expert experience, knowledge, and reasoning methods. Through analysis and reasoning, the inference engine can provide insights and solutions to problems.

This article presents future prospects for intelligent AVC embedding methods and system functions, building on an analysis of traditional AVC's limitations. Building on the standard CIM intelligent AVC embedding method and intelligent AVC, which feature distinct advantages over traditional AVC, the article proposes new directions for the future development and enhancement of smart AVC.
