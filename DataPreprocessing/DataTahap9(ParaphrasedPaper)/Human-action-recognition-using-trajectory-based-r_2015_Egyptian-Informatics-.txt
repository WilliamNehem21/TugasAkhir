Typically, human action recognition involves two main steps: action representation and action learning and classification. Existing approaches to action recognition are categorized by Weinland et al. based on action representation into global and local representations. Global representation approaches focus on detecting the entire body of a person using background subtraction or tracking, while local representation approaches use silhouettes, contours, or optical flow to represent localized aspects of a person. However, these representations are sensitive to changes in viewpoint, personal appearance, and partial occlusions.

Several detectors and descriptors have been proposed to improve local representation approaches, such as the cuboid detector, Hessian detector, dense sampling detector, and various descriptors for space-time interest points (STIPs). Despite the popularity of local representation approaches, they have drawbacks, particularly in their failure to account for spatial and temporal relationships between local features, which are crucial for effective action recognition.

This paper is structured as follows: Section 2 reviews previous work in this area, Section 3 describes the proposed trajectory-based approach for video representation, Section 4 presents the experimental setup and discusses the obtained results, and Section 5 concludes the paper.

In this study, the authors propose an approach to local representation of human actions based on trajectories, aiming to address the limitations of existing methods. They utilize the cuboid detector to generate denser trajectories and match the spatial information of detected STIPs over consecutive frames to extract their actual movements. Additionally, flow vectors computation is used to improve the temporal scalability of the detected STIPs.

The proposed approach is evaluated on three popular datasets: Weizmann, KTH, and UCF Sports, representing constrained and non-constrained environments with different conditions. The results show that the proposed approach outperforms previous trajectory-based approaches, achieving a higher accuracy on the evaluated datasets.

Furthermore, it is reported that the proposed approach achieved a 2% improvement over dense trajectories on the UCF Sports dataset, and a 0.4% improvement on the KTH dataset. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed trajectory-based approach for local representation of human actions.
