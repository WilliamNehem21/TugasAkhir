This paper is supported by the EPSRC Advanced Research Fellowship EP/D072786/1 on the structure of quantum information and its implications for IT, as well as EPSRC Grant EP/C500032/1 on high-level methods in quantum computation and quantum information. The research was partly motivated by interactions with Yannick Delbecque, Dan Gottesman, and Jon Yard at the Quantum Information, Computation, and Logic Workshop at the Perimeter Institute in July 2005, and benefited from collaboration with Keye Martin on domain theory. Peter Selinger provided valuable feedback on an earlier draft of this paper.

The aim of this work is to analyze the fundamental quantitative concepts of quantum information theory in a qualitative manner and to integrate them into a cohesive framework. We anticipate that this approach will lead to the identification of new canonical and unifying concepts. Although this work is still ongoing and not fully represented here, we anticipate the development of a compositional theory on quantum informatic resources, which will significantly expand upon recent proposals by Devetak, Harrow, and Winter.
