The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: section 2 provides background information and a review of related literature. Section 3 offers a detailed examination of the twedistance operator. Section 4 discusses three approaches (regression, interpolation, and curve barcoding) and how they are employed to assess similarity. Section 6 presents the experimental procedures and results, and section 7 provides concluding remarks and suggests ideas for future research.

The experiment assesses the accuracy of four approaches based on spatial similarity and its dependence on different sampling rates. The trains dataset is filtered to include 9 trains, one from each line, and these trains are then resampled to produce ten different samples, resulting in 90 trajectories. Similarly, the trucks dataset is filtered to 205 trajectories, with each trajectory resampled to 6 samples, yielding 1230 trajectories. These final trajectories encompass both original trajectories and sampled versions. The sampling rates vary according to the transportation mode, as some rates result in an insufficient number of observations (e.g., cubic interpolation requires at least four observations). The datasets are evaluated based on spatial, directional, and speed similarity.

Upon assessing the accuracy of each experiment, the average accuracy is calculated, revealing that interpolation consistently yields the highest accuracy results among the approaches, with an average accuracy of up to 90%. As a recommendation for future work, there is a need for an automated feature prediction tool that can generically predict the features to be used as similarity criteria based on the input data.
