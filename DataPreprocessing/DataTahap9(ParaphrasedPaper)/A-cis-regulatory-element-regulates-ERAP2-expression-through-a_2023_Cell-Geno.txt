Venema et al. conducted a study to investigate the function of genetic variants in the erap2 gene, particularly their association with autoimmune disorders and severe infectious diseases. The study utilized genome editing and functional genomics techniques to demonstrate that these genetic variants regulate the expression of erap2 through multiple independent mechanisms. Specifically, the researchers found that a specific genetic variant, rs2248374, is crucial for the expression of erap2, but additional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) also play a role in influencing erap2 expression through local conformational changes that enhance promoter interactions.

The study employed CRISPR-Cas9-mediated homology-directed repair (HDR) strategies to perform allelic replacement of the rs2248374 variant in different cell lines. Additionally, the researchers used quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to assess the expression of erap2 and related genes in edited cell clones. The findings suggest that these genetic variants have implications for our understanding of diseases associated with erap2, as they may affect the regulation of erap2 expression, potentially contributing to autoimmune conditions. The study also highlighted the need to differentiate the functional effects of these genetic variants on erap2 expression, particularly in the context of disease etiology.

Furthermore, the study conducted copy number profiling and analysis of genomic regions using SNP array analysis to monitor potential genomic alterations in cell cultures. The results of the study provide valuable insights into the regulatory mechanisms of erap2 and their potential implications for human diseases.
