In a study by David Irwin et al., a mobile application called CloudCast was introduced for providing personalized short-term weather forecasts. The research aimed to investigate the idea that current cloud platform connectivity and diversity could reduce the impact of data staging and computational latency for nowcasting. The application's architecture involved linking the radar sensor network of the Collaborative Adaptive Sensing of the Environment. A nowcasting algorithm was utilized to predict short-term high impact weather events, with the authors noting high accuracy for 10-minute nowcasts. Testing indicated a 2-minute delay in delivering a 15-minute nowcast image to a mobile client, highlighting the potential of commercial and research cloud services for real-time nowcasting applications.

Bobby D. Gerardo et al. presented a flash flood warning system that utilizes SMS to provide advanced warning information. The system architecture incorporated a remote monitoring device comprising an ultrasonic sensor, pulse detector, wireless modem, Fez Domino board, and a solar-charged 6-volt battery. Water level and speed measurements were transmitted to a server, where the data were used to train a multiple linear regression (MLR) model for predicting future water flow. The predicted values were then used to calculate a risk value, which in turn determined a threshold for issuing warnings to users.

S.G. Totad et al. conducted an experimental analysis of a cloud-based real-time weather forecasting system, investigating the use of cloud and IoT for weather data collection and prediction. The experiment utilized DHT11 sensors to measure temperature and humidity, an Arduino board connected to a Raspberry Pi, and a public cloud (Thingspeak) for storing the collected data. Using one year of prior data, the researchers performed correlation analysis and developed an ARIMA model for predicting values for the upcoming year, with satisfactory results for the first two successive years.

Another study focused on utilizing a convolutional neural network (CNN) for forecasting severe convective weather (SCW) conditions, comparing the CNN model to other machine learning algorithms including support vector machine (SVM), linear regression (LR), and random forest classifiers. The CNN model demonstrated a 33.2% increase in SCW detection compared to other algorithms, highlighting its superior performance in forecasting severe weather conditions.

The research provides a significant architectural and mathematical framework for real-time weather forecasting systems, as well as exploring collaborative weather forecasting's potential to enhance forecasts in correlated regions. The proposed architectures and multi-platform applications also offer ease of deployment and scalability.

Additionally, the study incorporated the use of the JSoup class to connect to an API, fetching and parsing HTML data, converting it to a JSON object, and sending it to the local server app or cloudant platform for storage.

The web application developed provided a real-time graph displaying weather parameter variations, allowing users to download weather data and view analytics results. Furthermore, the study utilized the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm for regression, implementing collaborative sliding window cross-validation to evaluate the performance of various machine learning algorithms.

The findings indicated that machine learning algorithms (MLR, MPR, and KNN) had lower average errors compared to deep learning networks (MLP and CNN), with the MLR algorithm achieving the lowest overall error of 2.11% and the CNN network encountering the highest error of 4.81%. This suggested that the MLR algorithm better captured the nonlinear relationship between the explanatory variables.

Lastly, the study by Mimboro P, Lumban Gaol F, Lesie Hendric Spits Warnars H, and Soewito B focused on a weather monitoring system for oil palm plantations using a recurrent neural network algorithm, as presented in the IEEE 5th International Conference on Information Technology, Information Systems, and Electrical Engineering (ICITISEE) in 2021.
