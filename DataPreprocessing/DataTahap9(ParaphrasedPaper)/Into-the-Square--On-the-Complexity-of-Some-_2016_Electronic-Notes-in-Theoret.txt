Betweenness centrality is a commonly used graph metric associated with community structures. Specifically, the betweenness centrality of a vertex v is determined by the sum of the ratios of the number of shortest paths from one node to another passing through v, to the total number of shortest paths between those nodes, excluding vertex v itself. Despite significant research efforts, no subquadratic algorithm for computing the betweenness centrality of a single vertex (betweennesscentralityv) has been discovered, as evidenced by works such as [9, 4, 17]. Furthermore, the complexity of computing the subset graph is not solely dependent on the output size but is an inherent property. Our results demonstrate that even determining whether the subset graph has no edge is computationally challenging, indicating a lack of a truly subquadratic algorithm for verifying correct solutions or handling sparse output instances.

In section 2, we will define the problems to be analyzed and introduce the concept of quasilinear reducibility. Section 3 will present our new hardness results, with the details of other reductions included in the extended version of this paper. Section 4 will offer positive results for identifying transitive graphs and comparability graphs, while Section 5 will conclude the paper and pose some open problems.

The proof of the theorem presented in contains all the steps from the k-sat problem to the graphdiameter2or3 problem. However, these steps are separated in the extended version of this paper to demonstrate the hardness of an interesting intermediate problem, specifically the computation of the diameter for split graphs (and by extension, chordal graphs). The remainder of this section focuses on proving that all hyperbolicity problems are more challenging than the graphdiameter2or3 problem, beginning with the statement of two lemmas.
