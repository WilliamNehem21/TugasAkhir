In addition to converting entire documents, it is crucial to have the capability to translate small changes from an informal representation into a formal representation and vice versa. Performing a global transformation would lead to rewriting the entire document in the text editor, resulting in the loss of significant portions of natural language text authored by the user. Furthermore, such a transformation would reset the proof assistance system's data structure to the abstract level of proof sketches. This means that any progress made in incorporating calculus operations in an update must be simultaneously applied to the target document. XML-RPC is a remote procedure call protocol that utilizes XML for encoding calls and HTTP as a transport mechanism. It is a simple protocol, defining only a few data types and commands, and its complete description can be found in a two-page document.

In contrast, our approach proposes a formal representation language for mathematical content that is independent of any specific logic or calculus. This ability allows us to represent diverse content regardless of the underlying logic. Furthermore, the language permits us to represent various levels of concepts and underspecification, making it well-suited for representing proofs authored in a natural manner by humans. Our approach is closely related to the mathlang project, which also advocates for a top-down approach from natural mathematical texts to machine processing. However, the mathlang project primarily focuses on supporting the analysis of abstract representations through type checking. Unlike our approach, the gap between real theorem provers and mathematical assistance tools remains unresolved.

It initiates the execution of an action with its evaluated arguments, including the session name (as a string), the unique identifier of the selected action (as a string), and the arguments presented as a list of pairs with a name (as a string) and value (as a string). The function returns a list comprising a patch for the current menu (as a string), a patch for the document (as a string), and a custom answer (as a string), or an error message.
