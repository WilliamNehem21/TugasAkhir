The strength of signals and other environmental variables influence the disturbance in wireless communication networks, which may not necessarily be symmetric. The scheduling of communications in such networks can be represented as a weighted improper coloring, which serves as a generalization.

Let g=(v, e) be an undirected graph. For a vertex v in v, let d(v) denote the degree of v in g, and ds(v) denote the degree of v in the subgraph induced by a subset s of v. A k-coloring c: v 1,..., k of g partitions the vertex set v into k vertex-disjoint subsets, and c[v] denotes the set of vertices that have the color c(v). A k-coloring c is d-defective if for each vertex v, dc[v](v) d. A d-defective k-coloring is also referred to as a (k, d)-defective coloring. It's important to note that ordinary coloring represents a special case of defective coloring where d= 0, making defective coloring a proper generalization of ordinary coloring.

The paper introduces a tree decomposition of a graph g=(v, e), which is a pair (x, t), where x= x1,..., xn is a collection of subsets of v, and t is a tree whose vertices are the subsets in x, referred to as super-vertices. The width of a tree decomposition(x, t) is defined as maxi xi 1. The treewidth of a graph g is the minimum width of any tree decomposition of g. A path decomposition is a tree decomposition(x, t) where t is a path graph. The pathwidth of a graph g is the minimum width of any path decomposition of g. Furthermore, path and tree decompositions can be extended to digraphs by using the underlying graph (i.e., by treating directed edges as undirected).

The concept of defective coloring and the related t-improper coloring was initially introduced by Andrews and Jacobsen, Harary and Frank, and Cowen et al. The focus of Cowen et al. and Cowen, Goddard, and Jeserum was on graphs on embeddable surfaces, where they characterized (k, d) such that planar graphs are d-defective k-colorable and produced results for surfaces of higher genus. Frick and Henning provided extremal results on the defective chromatic number, while Kang and McDiarmid proved bounds on the growth of the defective chromatic number of random graphs. Apart from the degrees of vertices, other properties related to defective coloring have also been studied, and Frick provides a comprehensive survey on such variations of the problem.

Consider a graph g, and assume that any number of 0-weight edges is added to this graph to create a new graph gj. Since these 0-weight edges impose no new restrictions, it is evident that g is k-colorable if and only if gj is k-colorable. In fact, 0-weight edges can be added until the graph is complete without adding any restrictions, allowing the assumption that the graph is complete. This observation leads to a lemma stating that every vertex in the graph has at most one incident monochromatic edge due to the weights being less than 1.

An algorithm is proposed for a weighted digraph g=(v, e, w) with bounded treewidth k and bounded maximum indegree. This algorithm is an adaptation of the classic fixed-parameter algorithm for ordinary graph coloring and tracks the colors of the in-neighbors of the vertices being colored to check weight restrictions. The algorithm returns the minimum number of colors in any coloring found, representing the weighted improper chromatic number of the input graph g.

The paper demonstrates that the results of the function calls can be efficiently computed using dynamic programming, due to the acyclic call hierarchy of the recursive calls. As a result, the algorithm has a linear time complexity when applied to graphs of bounded treewidth and bounded maximum degree, including bounded degree interval graphs, cn kt where t is bounded, and kth powers of paths and cycles where k is bounded.

The paper also presents algorithm 2, which is an adaptation of the classic fixed-parameter algorithm for ordinary graph coloring, and keeps track of vertex budgets to check weight restrictions. This algorithm returns the minimum number of colors in any coloring found, offering the weighted improper chromatic number of the input graph g.

The paper concludes by indicating further research opportunities, including finding necessary and sufficient conditions on edge weights for a 3-regular graph to be 2-colorable. Additionally, the paper suggests that a combination of rounding edge weights with the fixed-parameter algorithm for bounded treewidth and bounded precision weights might imply an approximation algorithm for weighted improper coloring of graphs of bounded treewidth.
