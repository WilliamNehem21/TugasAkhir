This paper's structure consists of several sections. Section 2 provides a review of relevant literature on usability, and Section 3 outlines the main aim of the study. Section 4 offers a detailed account of the various methodologies utilized for assessing website usability. The analysis and experimental results are presented in Section 5. The study is concluded in Section 6.

Kostaras and Xenos (2007) utilized heuristic evaluation to assess the usability of the Hellenic Open University website. This assessment involved two phases conducted by usability experts. In the first phase, evaluators familiarized themselves with the system, while the second phase involved validating the implementation of each heuristic rule derived by Nielsen. The findings and detected violations of each heuristic rule from individual evaluator reports are discussed in this paper.

In their research, Daher and Elkabani conducted a qualitative study on web portal usability in six Lebanese universities. They also performed a usability study of the Beirut Arab University web portal. The first part of the study involved distributing questionnaires to students from the six universities to identify common usability issues. A comparative study of common services available on university web portals was based on questionnaire results. The second part of the study included qualitative and quantitative evaluations of the Beirut Arab University web portal, where participants were asked to perform specific tasks and complete questionnaires. The evaluation incorporated the use of the six sigma method to calculate usability metrics.

Participants completed tasks on one of three websites, and their sessions were recorded for analysis. Task completion time was measured to assess system efficiency, including successful and unsuccessful attempts. Additionally, post-task satisfaction ratings were collected using an after scenario questionnaire (ASQ) with a 7-point rating scale.

Analysis of the task completion time across the three websites was performed, and independent t-tests were conducted to test the statistical significance of differences in task completion time among the institutes. The study highlighted that while evaluation tools provide broad insights, manual accessibility testing is essential for accurate accessibility assessment.

Furthermore, the study reported satisfaction levels across websites, indicating higher satisfaction when task completion time was reduced. Additionally, the study compared the website's scores to WAMMI database averages, finding that the website scored higher than average for attractiveness.
