Experimental evidence has demonstrated the occurrence of regular self-oscillations in thermo-responsive polymer solutions subjected to temperature gradient fields. The paper provides a theoretical explanation for these observed phenomena and suggests that they can be harnessed for the development of new sensor panels. Research into self-organization processes in stimuli-responsive polymer solutions has long been a topic of interest among scholars (Zaslavsky, 1988), particularly in the context of understanding the pre-biological mechanisms of evolution (Ergozhin et al., 2008).

This study investigates a 2% solution of copolymer N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAAm) and acrylic acid (AA) with a molar concentration ratio of 90:10 at pH 7.6, within the temperature range of 26 to 40°C. The solution exhibits a phase transition temperature of approximately 32°C, characterized by a sharp increase in turbidity, allowing for the measurement of macromolecule content through turbidimetry. Additionally, variations in the number of macromolecules undergoing state changes can be assessed by monitoring optical density fluctuations.

Consequently, novel types of waves can emerge in the liquid phase under specific conditions. These environments can be transformed into films through the application of cross-linking agents, such as gel formation to create a crosslinked polymer network. Furthermore, these waves can be detected using both optical and electrical devices, as the loss of solubility results in a rapid reduction in macromolecule ionization, leading to a significant increase in the local specific resistance of the solution.
