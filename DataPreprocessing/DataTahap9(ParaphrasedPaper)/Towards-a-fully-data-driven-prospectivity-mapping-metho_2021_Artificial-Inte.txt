The research for this study utilized geochemical data from lake sediments, with details of the sampling protocol, analytical methodology, and quality control procedures outlined in McCurdy et al. (2016). The survey encompassed 3441 samples, including field duplicates, and was conducted at a resolution of approximately one sample per 13 km2. The data used in this study stems from a project to re-analyze lake sediment samples using modern analytical methods as part of the Geological Survey of Canada's GEM Program for geochemical anomalies related to bedrock mineralization. The dataset was transformed using centered log-ratio (clr) aitchison, 1982, with censored data being replaced with half the detection limit. The study also delved into the suitability of log-ratio transformations and their impact on data embedding, algorithm selection, and performance for the intended machine learning task of identifying geochemical anomalies.

Regarding the use of geochemical compositional data, various multivariate techniques have been employed, with the primary objective being the creation of prospectivity maps that accurately detect true geochemical anomalies associated with mineral occurrences. While the definition of a geochemical anomaly has remained unchanged, the methods for distinguishing baselines from anomalies have continuously evolved and improved.
