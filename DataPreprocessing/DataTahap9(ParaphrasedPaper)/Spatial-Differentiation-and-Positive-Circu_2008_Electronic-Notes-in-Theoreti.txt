Biologist R. Thomas proposed a principle that connects multistationarity in gene systems within a single cell to the presence of a positive circuit in the system's regulatory graph. This paper seeks to extend this principle to the context of spatial differentiation. The study focuses on the interactions of genes in multiple biological cells arranged in a one-dimensional infinite grid, with gene expression levels assumed to be boolean. The authors demonstrate that the existence of a positive circuit is a necessary condition for a specific type of multistationarity, which corresponds to spatial differentiation.

The research initially considers a simplified scenario with fixed cells located on a one-dimensional infinite grid (the set of integers, denoted as Z). This simplification accentuates the fundamental formalism. The more biologically realistic case of hexagonal two-dimensional grids has also been examined subsequently, with an application to the formation of sense organs in Drosophila.

It is established that the presence of a positive circuit is necessary for the occurrence of multiple periodic fixed points that have at least one cell with the same expression levels. Furthermore, it is shown that a single non-constant periodic fixed point is sufficient to imply the existence of a positive circuit, provided its smallest period involves two cells with the same expression levels.

It is important to note that the approach developed in this paper involves deriving regulatory graphs from a given dynamics, which differs from the conventional presentation of the correspondence between graphs and dynamics in biology. The study demonstrates the compatibility of these approaches.

The analysis considers interactions between multiple cells situated on an infinite one-dimensional grid. The focus is on the evolution of systems comprising the same set of genes in each cell. The study defines the expression level of gene i in cell x in state s as fi(s)(x), which represents the value toward which the expression level tends when the system is in the given state. The investigation primarily concerns the presence of fixed points, and it is independent of assumptions about the dynamics such as synchronous, asynchronous, with delays, or parallel evolution of the cells.

The paper then presents a proof involving fixed points of different periods and their relationship to a positive circuit in the regulatory graph. It is demonstrated that fixed points with a common cell imply the existence of a positive circuit.
