In various geoscience applications, the observed values of the response variable often fall below or above the detection limit of the measuring instrument. These observations are known as censored observations and can be left-censored, right-censored, or interval-censored. Censoring refers to a situation where the true value of a measurement or observation is only partially known. Left censoring indicates that an observation is below a certain value, but by an unknown amount. Right censoring means that an observation is above a certain value, but the extent of the excess is unknown. Interval censoring indicates that an observation falls within an interval between two values. Censored data pose a significant challenge when utilizing methods such as randomized quadratic programming for spatial prediction, which involves sampling new principal component coefficients and reconstructing regression tree predictors that accurately reflect the response variable's observations (both censored and uncensored) at sampling locations. The resulting spatial prediction of the response variable is obtained by averaging the ensemble of reconstructed regression tree predictors, which effectively takes into account the response variable's observations at sampling locations, whether censored or uncensored. Additionally, the method provides an estimation of the uncertainty associated with the response variable's prediction.

The proposed machine learning method for spatial prediction of censored response variables is demonstrated and compared to ad hoc methods using both simulated and real-world data.

The predictive performance of the proposed machine learning method is evaluated using well-known prediction accuracy statistics, including mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (CCC). Lower MAE and RMSE values indicate better prediction performance, while a CCC value closer to 1 indicates superior prediction accuracy. A comparison of prediction performance between the proposed method and two ad hoc methods is conducted.

A simulation is performed using the turning bands method in the R package "rgeostats". The simulated data example, for which the ground truth is known throughout the study domain, represents a scenario where there is a non-linear relationship between the response variable and predictor variables, including interactions between predictor variables. Additionally, the response variable exhibits spatial autocorrelation and a non-Gaussian distribution.

In an application example, the response variable of interest is the geochemical concentration of scandium (Sc) observed at 568 sampling locations in southwest England. The response variable is subject to a lower detection limit of 3 mg/kg, resulting in left-censoring of observations. Censored observations of the response variable account for approximately 6% of the total observations, which are then divided into a training set (around 75%) and a testing set (approximately 25%). Given the emphasis on the value of censored observations, the testing set consists of 625 observations that are below the lower detection limit and 625 observations that are above the upper detection limit.

The proposed machine learning method offers the advantage of naturally incorporating censored observations of the response variable, in contrast to ad hoc methods such as deletion and substitution. Unlike ad hoc methods, the proposed approach does not involve the substitution, imputation, or discarding of censored observations, and it can perfectly account for both censored and uncensored observations. Only the final step of the proposed method, involving randomized quadratic programming, needs to be executed. The method is also straightforward to implement as it combines existing machine learning, Monte Carlo sampling, and optimization techniques and can accommodate any type of spatial correlation structure in the response variable.
