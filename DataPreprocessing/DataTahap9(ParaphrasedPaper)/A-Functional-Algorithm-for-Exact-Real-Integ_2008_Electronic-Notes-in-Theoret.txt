This paper presents a novel algorithm for exact real integration over a specific class of self-similar spaces and measures as defined by Hutchinson. The algorithm, implemented in an idealized lazy functional programming language, is proven to be correct using domain theory. This work extends an algorithm developed by Alex Simpson for exact Riemann integration over the real line, and the implemented algorithm in the functional language Haskell yields some initial findings.

There are various computational approaches to representing real numbers, some through extensional methods, such as the interval domain, and others through intensional approaches, where existing type structures are used, as outlined in prior research. The authors of this paper particularly favor the latter approach, specifically focusing on infinite streams of digits as studied by Kreitz et al.

In essence, the paper outlines a key result that suggests any invariant space can be generated by a set of contractions with C.C. realizations. Although the proof is detailed in Section 3.5, the paper presents initial examples to illustrate this result.

The fundamental characteristic of the real line, which motivated integration algorithms in previous work, is a fundamental trait shared by all invariant spaces. Furthermore, it serves as the defining characteristic of the invariant measures on such spaces -- in other words, every space that can be integrated in this manner is an invariant space with respect to some "s," and conversely.
