Cellular automata have been a widely studied model of computation for the past fifty years, offering a powerful tool for simulating various phenomena, such as gas flows and pedestrian circulation in railway stations, as well as other real-world physical, chemical, and sociological problems. Despite their simplicity as dynamical systems, cellular automata pose challenging theoretical questions that remain unresolved. Additionally, they are a model of computation to which the theory of computability applies, with numerous results on their computational complexity and the Turing complete power of computation.

In recent works, researchers have explored the relationship between the existence of garden of eden and the growth function of the group associated with Cayley graphs. This function characterizes the number of group elements representable by a product of at most n generators and their inverses. While earlier works have examined this question in different settings of Cayley groups, the application of techniques involving Cayley graphs is limited to cases where the generating polygon follows specific conditions. However, techniques have been developed to facilitate the implementation of cellular automata in infinitely many tessellations of the hyperbolic plane, regardless of the parities of the tessellations.

Cellular automata operate on regular grids, and in the hyperbolic plane there exist infinitely many such grids. Specifically, the pentagrid and the ternary heptagrid are considered as the simplest ones. The construction of the pentagrid involves replicating a regular pentagon with right angles in its sides, while the ternary heptagrid is constructed recursively. Notably, the hyperbolic plane lacks a privileged point and is intrinsically non-oriented, which affects the definition of directions within the plane.

Despite the challenges posed by the hyperbolic plane, the proof of the theorem concerning cellular automata in this context requires defining the transition function based on the number of neighbors in a given state. These results lead to the need for new arguments to prove the undecidability of surjectivity or reversibility of cellular automata in the hyperbolic plane.

In conclusion, the undecidability of surjectivity and reversibility of the global function of a cellular automaton in the hyperbolic plane aligns with the undecidability of the tiling problem for the hyperbolic plane, as demonstrated by previous independent works using different methods. This suggests the conjecture that surjectivity and reversibility of the global function of a cellular automaton in the hyperbolic plane are undecidable.
