Fish experience the accumulation of heavy metals through the absorption and retention of these substances as they move up the food chain. This process is facilitated by the aquatic environment, where filtrating organisms such as phytoplankton and shellfish help to filter and retain particles in suspension, leading to the bioaccumulation of metals in fish as they consume these organisms and absorb metals through their gills.

During the acclimatization period, the fish were fed a daily diet of commercial feed specifically designed for omnivorous fish, while they were not fed during the acute toxicity tests. The acclimation procedures and experimental protocols followed the guidelines set out in the ABNT NBR 15088.

For the toxicity tests, the fish were exposed to varying concentrations of zinc sulfate (30; 45; 60; 75 and 90 mg/l), determined based on literature data and preliminary tests. After being placed in containers with specific water quality parameters for 24 hours, the fish were exposed to the metal-contaminated water for 96 hours, and measurements and observations were recorded, including the collection and quantification of dead individuals.

Analytical curves were established using standardized solutions to evaluate accuracy and recovery methods, and the bioaccumulation of metals in fish was assessed. The results showed that zinc, lead, cadmium, and chromium were bioconcentrated in the fish, with cadmium and lead showing notably high relative concentrations.

In relation to the sensitivity of the fish species to the tested metals, lead and cadmium were found to be more toxic based on both acute and chronic toxicity tests, while zinc showed higher bioconcentration and lower toxicity. On the other hand, chromium exhibited lower bioconcentration and was better tolerated by the fish than the other metals tested.

Cadmium and lead, both considered nonessential and highly harmful to organisms, were found to accumulate in the fish at significant levels. Despite some species having physiological mechanisms to mitigate the damages caused by cadmium and lead, there is no guarantee of complete protection.

The study highlights the importance of monitoring these metals in the environment and the effectiveness of using P. caudimaculatus as a bioindicator for such contaminants. Due to its characteristics and adaptability, P. caudimaculatus is considered an ideal bioindicator organism for assessing the effects of metal contamination in aquatic environments.

Overall, the findings indicate that lead nitrate II was the most toxic salt for P. caudimaculatus, followed by cadmium nitrate, zinc sulfate, and potassium dichromate, and the fish species proved to be an efficient bio-indicator of cadmium, chromium, lead, and zinc. This suggests that the use of native species as bioindicators is crucial for environmental protection, as it helps to assess the susceptibility of local biota to contaminants and identify and protect contaminated sites.
