The genetic algorithm (GA) was employed to explore cellular automata (CA) capable of demonstrating specific computational behaviors across their rule space. The focus was on two commonly studied computational tasks: the synchronization task (ST) and the density classification task (DCT). These tasks have traditionally been investigated within a 1D cellular automata rule space, with limited examination of DCT in 2D spaces using the Moore neighborhood.

This paper presents results and findings from investigations into both the aforementioned computational tasks. The ST and DCT were explored in the classical 1D space using radius 2 and radius 3 rules, resulting in rules with 32 and 128 bits respectively. Additionally, these tasks were also investigated in 2D spaces using Von Neumann and Moore neighborhoods, yielding rules with 32 and 512 bits.

Section 2 offers a brief overview of the two widely studied computational problems in CA research. Section 3 discusses the historical usage of evolutionary algorithms to identify effective CA rules for specific tasks, while Section 4 provides a historical context for the experiments involving ST and DCT in both one and two-dimensional CA lattices, presenting the results and analysis of current experiments. The main conclusions drawn from this work are summarized in Section 5.

The complexity of the synchronization task is notable, as small-radius CA rules rely on local interactions, while synchronous oscillation is a global property. Effective CA rules must be capable of transferring information over large space-time distances, as the locality of interaction can lead to regions of local synchrony, making the design of a CA that guarantees coherence across spatially distant regions challenging.

Other evolutionary computation techniques such as genetic programming and coevolutionary approaches have been utilized to identify effective CA rules for these tasks. These investigations have led to significant findings, including the discovery of rules with high efficacy for performing DCT and ST tasks. Notably, a rule with an efficacy of 88.99% for DCT was identified, as well as rules achieving 100% efficacy for the ST task.

Adaptive fitness evaluation and the incorporation of heuristics have been essential in guiding the evolutionary search for effective CA rules. By incorporating parameter-based heuristics and heuristic-related information, researchers have been able to improve the efficiency of the genetic search and identify rules with high performance on various computational tasks.

In summary, this work presents an extensive examination of the synchronization task and density classification task in CA contexts, exploring these tasks across different neighborhoods in both one-dimensional and two-dimensional cases. The findings shed light on the efficacy of various CA rules for performing these tasks and highlight the importance of incorporating adaptive evaluation and heuristics in guiding the evolutionary search process.
