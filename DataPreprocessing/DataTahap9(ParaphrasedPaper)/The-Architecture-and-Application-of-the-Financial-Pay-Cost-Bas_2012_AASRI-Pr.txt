The development of a student charging system that connects the functional department of students with an outside school bank allows for the effective management of various financial processes, such as savings, consumption, student identity authentication, information queries, settlements, and management. This system has the capability to deduct various expenses, deliver student subsidies, scholarships, and allowances automatically, and gather fee statistics at any time. Additionally, it enables the sharing of information resources and provides various forms of inquiry and statistical functions. Emphasizing the principle of safety first, the system ensures the security of funds and information. This paper presents design ideas and applications for a financial payment system within a digital campus environment, taking into account the characteristics and conditions of the campus card platform.

In the network construction, a multi-client/server framework is employed to create a "middle layer" that manages the connection between clients and the database. By handling tasks such as legality checks, data access, and business rules in the middle tier, the system significantly reduces the number of connections to the database server and allows for dynamic establishment and release of connections, thereby eliminating restrictions on clients. Moreover, changes to business rules can be implemented by modifying a component on the middle-tier server without requiring any adjustments to the client application. This approach ensures secure deployment and supports large-scale development, preventing single points of failure. The network structure is divided into storage networks, networks, and access networks, ensuring network security through isolated subnets.

The subsystem integrating user authentication, billing policies, and access control permissions provides comprehensive support for system management staff, including bulk operations such as account management, renewals, sales, and modifications. It also offers customized user information management capabilities, allowing administrators to tailor network operation information according to user habits, facilitating user account management across campus buildings and migrations.

Another subsystem is dedicated to user-level functions, offering options for changing usernames, passwords, and accessing payment records and network details. Users can also manage their network usage, including closing, pausing, and resuming network access. Additionally, a pre-registration web user interface is provided through the campus portal, allowing users to input personal information to ensure accuracy and reduce the workload of administrators.

The main bank book module serves as a communication hub between servers and storage for data processing and interface design. It includes interface communication programs for socket communication, database storage transfer, and basic database operations, as well as serial communication programs for single-chip microcomputers, primarily used for setting yardage machine IP addresses.
