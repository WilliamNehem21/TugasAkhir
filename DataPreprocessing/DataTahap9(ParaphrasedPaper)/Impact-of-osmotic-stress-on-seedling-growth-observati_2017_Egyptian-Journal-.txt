Delaying seed germination and reducing its rate is one consequence of water shortage, which can also lead to significant changes in the physiology and biochemistry of seedlings. However, certain plants have developed physiological adaptations that allow them to withstand water stress, such as increased activity of antioxidant enzymes that help in scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS). Excessive production of ROS can damage essential biomolecules in cell compartments and membranes, thereby indicating the extent of a plant's acclimation to stress based on the condition of its cellular membranes. In particular, the impact of water stress on the antioxidant defense system and membrane characteristics in wheat and other plants has been extensively studied. 

The identification of drought-resistant plant genotypes is an important objective, especially in arid and semi-arid regions. However, drought is difficult to control in the field due to unpredictable rainfall, which can counteract water deficit. As a result, assessing plant response to drought at the early seedling stage has commonly been accomplished using chemical desiccators such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) to induce water deficit in the nutrient media. 

Statistical analysis of the data collected in this study involved obtaining the means and standard deviations of various germination parameters and biochemical investigations, and then subjecting the data to a one-way completely randomized analysis of variance (ANOVA) test at a 5% probability level. The values obtained were compared using least significant difference (LSD) tests with small letters denoting different levels of significance. For each criterion, the mean value was calculated for all genotypes under control conditions as well as under moderate and severe drought conditions. The percentage difference for each drought level compared to the control was also calculated, and the total percentage difference between drought in general and control was recorded as the average of the two individual percentages.

Water deficit is a major constraint to agricultural production that can hinder plant growth, particularly at the juvenile stage. The results of the current study indicated that PEG-induced drought negatively affected the morphological features of seedlings in various wheat genotypes, as evidenced by changes in plumule and radicle length, seedling fresh mass and water content, and the number of adventitious roots. However, mild stress increased the number of adventitious roots in only four genotypes, while severe drought had a more pronounced effect on all the scrutinized parameters.

Water availability is crucial for seed germination and early seedling development. Lack of water can suppress seed germination and slow the growth rate of seedlings. The study found that applying PEG at various levels reduced plumule and radicle length, seedling fresh mass, and water content in the different wheat genotypes. Interestingly, the number of adventitious roots increased in some genotypes, possibly as an adaptive response to absorb more water from the surrounding medium. The study also noted an increase in the dry mass of water-deficient wheat seedlings, likely due to the larger amount of unutilized stored food in the stressed seedlings. These findings align with previous studies indicating that the development of more adventitious roots is an adaptive mechanism exhibited by tolerant plant cultivars to acclimate to water deficit conditions.

The application of water stress inhibited the activity of certain antioxidant enzymes in all the studied wheat genotypes. However, there were variations in the response of different genotypes to stress, indicating significant genetic diversity in their ability to cope with drought. The study also introduced stress impact coefficient (SIF) as a unitless virtual value to summarize the overall behavior of the surveyed wheat genotypes, as well as stress impact index (SII) as a percentage to indicate the effect of stress on the estimated parameters.

In summary, the results of the study showed that chemical desiccation induced by PEG can suppress germination and seedling growth of different wheat genotypes. While the impact of stress on the morphological traits of wheat seedlings was more pronounced than that on their membrane features and antioxidant enzymes, there was significant variation in the ability of different wheat varieties to cope with drought, with some varieties showing more tolerance than others.
