The paper presents a comprehensive axiomatization of finite complete trace semantics for generative probabilistic transition systems. The approach is based on coalgebra, allowing for the potential axiomatization of other system types. The paper employs determinization to demonstrate soundness and completeness and shows that coalgebraic traces can be retrieved via determinization, a noteworthy result in itself. The approach is also adaptable to labelled transition systems, enabling the recovery of the established axiomatization of trace semantics proposed by Rabinovich.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 and 3 introduce the basics of coalgebras and coalgebraic trace semantics, as well as probabilistic transition systems and their trace semantics in concrete terms. Section 4 outlines the syntax of expressions for quantitative transition systems, while Section 5 presents and proves the main results of soundness and completeness through axiomatization. The paper concludes with final remarks in Section 6, and proofs are provided separately.

The subsequent sections of the paper demonstrate that by adding a single new axiom to the sound and complete axiomatization for bisimilarity, the obtained axiomatization is sound and complete with respect to trace semantics. This constitutes the primary technical achievement of the paper, and despite the simplicity of the axioms, proving their sufficiency for achieving completeness is a non-trivial task. Prior to delving into the technical details of the proof, the paper offers an intuitive overview of the underlying idea.

The approach taken in the paper is inspired by Rabinovichâ€™s work on axiomatizing trace semantics for LTS, wherein a calculus sound and complete with respect to bisimilarity served as the basis, with an additional axiom included. The coalgebraic approach utilized in the paper entails formulating constructions and results in highly general terms, which may help identify crucial conditions on the functor type of the system and explore potential generalizations.
