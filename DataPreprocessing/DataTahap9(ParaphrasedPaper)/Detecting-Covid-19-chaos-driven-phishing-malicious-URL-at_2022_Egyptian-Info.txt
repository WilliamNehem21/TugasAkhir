This academic paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the cyber-attacks that exploited the COVID-19 pandemic as a ruse, outlining a timeline of these attacks and discussing their impact. The researchers observed an average of four major COVID-19 related cyber-crime incidents occurring every month. The most commonly used social engineering techniques during the pandemic were identified as malicious domains, phishing, scamming, email forging, and mobile app spoofing. Ransomware, trojans, and bots were also regularly employed to exploit systems and resources. The paper proposes a set of mitigation strategies to prevent these attacks and suggests the use of a fuzzy logic and data mining-based intelligence system for detecting COVID-19 themed malicious URLs and phishing attacks.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 critically analyzes the existing state-of-the-art methods for cybersecurity in the context of COVID-19, highlighting their advantages and shortcomings. Section 3 outlines the timeline of COVID-19 themed cyber-attacks and examines how the pandemic has affected priorities and amplified the need for cybersecurity. It also discusses the impact of COVID-19 on various cyber-attacks, particularly phishing and ransomware attacks. Section 4 offers mitigation measures to stop these attacks before they can infiltrate the system or obtain user credentials. Section 5 proposes a fuzzy logic and data mining-based intelligence mechanism for handling various types of malicious URLs and phishing attacks. Section 6 presents an analysis of the efficiency of the proposed system and compares it with existing state-of-the-art approaches. The paper concludes in Section 7, highlighting areas for future research.

The pandemic provided expert cybercriminals with an opportunity to exploit public interest in COVID-19 for their social engineering tactics. As the virus spread globally, thousands of registered domains containing words related to COVID-19 were created as a lure for unsuspecting individuals seeking information. The paper emphasizes the importance of user awareness in preventing such attacks, highlighting the need for users to understand their vulnerabilities, identify trusted sources, and avoid sharing sensitive information via insecure channels.

The authors suggest that companies should implement more robust cybersecurity measures, including monitoring both inbound and outbound connections, identifying misleading news, and conducting thorough network analyses. They also point out the increased demand for cybersecurity professionals due to the evolving threat landscape. The paper discusses the use of fuzzy logic to quantify and qualify malicious URLs and phishing attempts, emphasizing its ability to differentiate between legitimate and illegitimate sources, thereby minimizing false positives and negatives in phishing detection.

Overall, the proposed system demonstrates a high detection accuracy of 98.19% and a low false negative rate of 2.76%, allowing users to access accurate COVID-19 information while effectively blocking phishing and malicious websites. However, the paper notes that the implementation of fuzzy logic-based techniques is more complex than heuristic-based methods, despite being more memory efficient and offering faster inference speed. The authors also highlight the potential for future research in this area.
