The aim of this study is to present the findings of an economic analysis of photovoltaic systems that meet the current regulations set by the legislative body of the Slovak Republic. The comparative method was applied to a building in the state sector located in eastern Slovakia to determine the optimal utilization of an installed 100kWp photovoltaic system. The comparison was conducted from the perspective of the client, with the primary goal being to identify the solution that provides the greatest benefit to the client. An assessment was made of the on-grid system supplemented with excess energy and the on-grid system with complete energy supplementation to the distribution network, taking into account the state support in the form of buy-back prices for the corresponding installed power plants.

The comparison was performed to determine the most advantageous solution for the client, considering various economic indicators such as costs, revenues, payback period, cash flow, and discounted cash flow. To conduct the analysis, it was necessary to establish constant and variable indicators for the different connections being compared. Constant indicators included factors such as the public sector nature of the building, electricity consumption of the facility, installed capacity, irradiance, photovoltaic system price, project and engineering costs, depreciation period, and insurance. Variable indicators encompassed the type of system connection and the state support in the form of varying buy-back prices for electricity.
