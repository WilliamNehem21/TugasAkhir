The central idea behind client reputations is that a particular host tends to be well-administered or poorly-administered over an extended period, and hosts that have previously engaged in malicious behavior are likely to do so in the future. Additionally, the study of host scanning patterns supports the assumption that a small number of top scanners are responsible for the majority of scans, and these scanners persist over a long period. The paper suggests that blacklisting repeat offenders could significantly reduce scan traffic on the Internet. The use of a collective memory of client behavior through reputations is favored over individual server-based approaches.

The paper is the first to systematically compare provider and client reputations, identifying unique challenges in client reputation systems under realistic adversary models. It discusses two architectures for collecting client behavior information: the reporter model, in which servers rank their experiences with clients, and the monitor model, in which independent observers rank client behavior based on traffic patterns. The paper also demonstrates how a combination of both models can address major threats to reputation validity.

The paper assumes a standardized "con" field to specify security incidents, such as scans, worms, DDoS attacks, and anomalies, along with type-specific details. It introduces an adversary model where attackers can compromise a certain number of machines and organize them into a botnet to submit malicious activities to the reputation system.

The study also addresses the challenges of false positives and the generation of suspicious info-items, proposing ways to handle them. Additionally, it discusses report generation, challenges related to fabricated reports, and the aggregation of reputation scores, emphasizing the importance of preventing harm to good clients during normal operation.

The paper concludes by outlining a distributed architecture for the reputation system, proposing mechanisms for scheduled retrieval of reputation scores and anonymized reports, and highlighting the need for cryptographic protection against report and reputation fabrication.

Overall, the paper provides a comprehensive overview of the challenges and potential solutions for designing a practical, secure, and usable client reputation system, laying the groundwork for further research in this area.
