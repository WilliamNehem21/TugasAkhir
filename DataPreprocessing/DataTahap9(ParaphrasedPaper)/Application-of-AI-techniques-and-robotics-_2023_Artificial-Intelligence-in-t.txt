This review paper has been compiled after analyzing over seven hundred papers and referencing more than 150 papers for review purposes. The paper provides a systematic review of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques across various agricultural phases, including the path planning of agricultural robots. The study highlights the common areas where AI is frequently applied, as well as areas where there is a significant need for AI applications. It identifies agricultural domains where existing processes could be improved using available techniques. The paper also showcases the application of various AI techniques and algorithms, emphasizing their use as hybrid models. The analysis of AI is presented based on simulation work, experimental work, application as a hybrid approach, and problem-solving in agriculture. Detailed tabular analysis and graphical conclusions are provided on a year-by-year basis to enhance the review's comprehensibility. The comprehensive review aims to distinguish between phases, such as cultivation and harvesting, which are still conventionally practiced. It is noted that most AI implementation is currently focused on the monitoring phase.

Regarding specific AI techniques, the review discusses the use of fuzzy logic (FL) in agricultural applications, highlighting its advantages over traditional decision sets and its widespread adoption in processes such as agricultural UAV navigation, aerial imaging, crop-cutting robots, farm monitoring, and harvesting. Furthermore, the review outlines the development of a soil fertilizer recommendation system using FL, as well as the use of FL in irrigation forecasting systems in agriculture.

Additionally, the paper delves into the application of artificial neural networks (ANN) in agriculture, particularly in implementing vision systems for precision farming, weed monitoring and control, and plant disease diagnosis using convolutional neural networks (CNN).

Genetic algorithms (GA) are also examined in the review, presenting their use in optimizing various agricultural processes such as water irrigation systems and crop disease identification.

The review also covers the application of the artificial potential field (APF) method for path planning of agricultural robots, along with the use of the harmony search (HS) algorithm and cell decomposition (CD) method in agricultural automation and optimization.

Overall, the paper presents a comprehensive overview of the application of AI techniques in agriculture, highlighting their current use and potential for advancement in various agricultural processes.
