The academic paper discusses the emerging importance of risk analysis as a systematic method for businesses to comprehend and prepare for potential risks. It focuses on security risk analysis and introduces three new modifiers that enhance the effectiveness of risk analysis. The modifiers, namely exposure factor during critical time (EFCT), exposure factor under retaliation (EFR), and mitigated risk against collusion (MRC), are proposed to provide a more comprehensive understanding of security threats and vulnerabilities.

The paper emphasizes that risk analysis evaluates the potential consequences of successful threats and assumes that threats will be successful with certainty. It highlights the significance of considering the concept of collusion among attackers when assessing the security of core assets within an enterprise. The paper outlines the risk assessment process, which involves identifying assets, analyzing threats and vulnerabilities, and proposing countermeasures. It also discusses the evaluation and implementation of countermeasures by senior management to mitigate risks.

The paper introduces various indicators, such as single loss expectancy (SLE), annualized loss expectancy (ALE), and annualized rate of occurrence (ARO), to quantify the likelihood and impact of security threats. It emphasizes the need to consider defense mechanisms and countermeasures when assessing potential vulnerabilities and their associated risks.

Furthermore, the paper presents examples and simulations to illustrate the application of the proposed modifiers, demonstrating their potential to enhance risk analysis. It also discusses the implications of incorporating the concept of retaliation into risk analysis, particularly in the context of security protocols and the broader security domain.

Overall, the paper proposes new modifiers to enrich the risk analysis process and presents simulated results to validate the potential benefits of these additions.
