The rise in demand for online sales systems has led to the creation of numerous web-based sales protocols. However, the online environment is vulnerable to security threats due to its open nature, which can expose systems to attacks. Denial of service attacks, for example, involve flooding a target with messages to prevent legitimate users from accessing resources.

Evaluating the performance of such systems is key, as it allows for the study of the impact and cost of cyber attacks on system performance. Modeling the performance of these systems can provide insights into how they behave in various scenarios, both with and without attacks, and ensure a sustainable level of performance.

In this study, the performance evaluation process algebra (PEPA) was used to model a system under investigation. PEPA is a well-known stochastic process algebra that represents a system as a set of interacting components engaging in activities to evaluate its performance.

Several researchers have previously examined and measured system performance under attack. For instance, Meng et al. studied the performance cost of security mechanisms in mobile offloading systems under timing attacks. They proposed a hybrid continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) and queuing model to explore the performance cost introduced by quantified security attributes, presenting measures to optimize the trade-off between security and performance.

Wang et al. explored the performance of an email system under various attacks using a model-based approach and a queuing network. Their study focused on evaluating the trade-off between performance and security using proposed metrics such as system availability, information leakage probability, and average queue length.

Gelenbe and Wang examined the performance of a warehouse in the presence of a denial of service attack on its web server, predicting the resulting income loss. They applied a queuing theory-based technique and suggested using their approach as an optimization problem for such systems. Similarly, Zhu and Martinez studied a resilient control problem for linear systems subject to replay attacks, employing model predictive control methods to investigate the influence of replay attacks on system stability and performance.

The investigation seeks to calculate the throughput of key actions of the customer, attacker, webserver, and warehouse using ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Additionally, the investigation aims to explore the population level of certain component states using ODEs, assuming all perishable products are initially fresh and subsequently counting down their lifetimes using a timer component.
