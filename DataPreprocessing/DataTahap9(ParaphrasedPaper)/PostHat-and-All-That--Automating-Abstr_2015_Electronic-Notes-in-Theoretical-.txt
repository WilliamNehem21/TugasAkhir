The algorithm maintains both a conservative estimate and an optimistic estimate of the desired result. The advantage of using a bilateral algorithm is that if it takes too long to compute, it can safely provide the optimistic estimate as the answer. The algorithm continuously works on improving the optimistic estimate at various stages, and given more time, it could potentially provide a more accurate answer. This kind of algorithm is referred to as an "interpreter" of the TSL meta-language, which automatically extends to TSL expressions and functions to create valid optimistic estimations. Standard analysis algorithms can then utilize these estimations to derive inductive A-invariants. However, there is typically some loss of precision with this interpretation approach, so the resulting analyses tend not to find the best inductive A-invariants.
