The renewable energy market is shaped by the interplay of supply and demand. The supply side includes the investment and production costs involved in accessing and utilizing renewable energy resources, while the consumption-oriented tools drive the demand for such resources.

The system for supporting electricity generation from renewable sources is closely intertwined with the trading of renewable energy in the energy sector. The predominant support mechanism is the system of feed-in tariffs, often complemented by additional payments linked to market prices, as evidenced in the majority of European Union countries. Also impactful are incentives such as investment grants and tax measures, which are widely utilized. Belgium, Romania, Poland, Italy, and Great Britain rely on the system of mandatory quotas combined with green certificate trading as their primary support system. Conversely, the use of competitive bidding as a tool for renewable energy support is less widespread, with current implementation observed in Ireland, Latvia, Italy, and Great Britain. Debate surrounding the prevalence of feed-in tariffs centers on their efficacy, with some viewpoints suggesting that this support mechanism distorts the market and lacks effectiveness.

Efforts are being made to elevate the significance of mandatory quotas and green certificate systems, as they have the potential to cultivate a more market-oriented environment and foster the accelerated development of renewable energy electricity production. However, newer member states are resistant to such changes, as they currently rely on feed-in tariffs and perceive the establishment of a market system based on green certificates as arduous and impracticable in the short term. Consequently, these newer member states are inclined towards enhancing the quality of their existing support systems.
