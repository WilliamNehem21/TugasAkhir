Establishing the stratigraphic framework is an essential technique in geological interpretation, with implications for reservoir estimation and geologic model construction (Cross and Lessenger, 1988). Stratigraphic correlation, a commonly used approach for providing information about stratigraphy and compartmentalization in a reservoir, is traditionally carried out by geological interpreters, making it a time-consuming and expertise-reliant process. In response to these challenges, automatic stratigraphic correlation methods have been proposed, leveraging computational algorithms and statistical techniques to analyze stratigraphic data and determine the relative ages of rock layers or sedimentary deposits. Several automatic stratigraphic correlation approaches, such as cross-correlation techniques (Southam and Hay, 1978; Mann and Dowell, 1978), dynamic waveform matching techniques, and dynamic time warping (Wheeler and Hale, 2014; Behdad, 2019) and their advancements, have been developed to reduce the reliance on human expertise. Furthermore, various loss functions have been proposed and applied to achieve accurate stratigraphic correlation.

In the ASDNet, a transition layer is introduced to mitigate the generation of a large number of feature maps by dense blocks, while the second half of the ASDNet serves as a decoder by maintaining non-linear transformations, downscaling feature map size, and performing reshaping operations to attain accurate stratigraphic correlation of well logs.

The study uses well logs to train and conduct blind tests, but limitations in data availability restrict the study to a specific set of well logs. To address this issue, sensitivity analysis of well logs is highlighted as crucial for automated stratigraphic correlation aided by deep learning.

The study also suggests challenges related to deep learning models for automated stratigraphic correlation. It notes that a large amount of labeled data, interpreted or calculated by experienced personnel, is required for training. Additionally, the precision of training labels is crucial for the modelâ€™s success. In future work, the study aims to introduce state-of-the-art tools for determining confidence intervals of automated stratigraphic correlation results, and mentions the potential use of unsupervised models, such as Gaussian mixture model-based methods.

Regarding future work, the study suggests that the segmentation model ASDNet could be extended to address other geological segmentation tasks and could be applied to tasks such as horizon picking and fault interpretation.
