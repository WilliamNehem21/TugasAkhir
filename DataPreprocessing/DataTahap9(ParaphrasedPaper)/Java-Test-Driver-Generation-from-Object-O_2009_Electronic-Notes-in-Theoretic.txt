In the realm of test-driven development for object-oriented programs, mock objects are increasingly employed for unit testing. There are several Java mock object frameworks available, all of which share the characteristic of specifying mock objects directly at the Java program level to emulate the test environment. While this direct usage of the programming language may initially attract software developers, the syntactic complexity at times detracts from the actual test specification, particularly when considering interaction traces.

To address this issue, we suggest the utilization of a Java-like test specification language that enables the description of the test harness behavior with respect to the anticipated interaction traces between the program and its environment. This language is specifically tailored for Java, reflecting the nested calls and return structure of thread-based interaction at the interface. From a given trace specification, a testing environment, comprising a set of classes for mock objects, can be synthesized.

Software testing plays a pivotal role in ensuring software quality. Unlike exhaustive methods for system verification and validation, testing is directed at detecting faults to enhance confidence in the system under test. To manage the complexity of modern software, testing needs to be methodical and integrated into the software development process. Test scripts should be automatically generated from the specification, and tools should handle the automation of various aspects and levels of the testing framework, such as unit, integration, or system testing.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 defines the specification language used to describe the trace-based behavior of the observer. Section 3, the primary focus of the paper, details the code generation from the abstract specification. Section 4 briefly discusses the extension of the specification language to the multi-threaded case. Finally, Section 5 concludes with related and future work.

Upon initialization, the actual interaction is described. Initially, a new instance of the component class "census" is created by invoking its constructor method and awaiting the return value, which is assigned to the local variable "c." The specification language views the instantiation of a component class as a specific case of a method call of the component by the tester. Subsequently, the tester calls the "census" method of component object "c," passing a copy of the set of voters to the component. After receiving all these calls, "census" returns to the tester the final result.

The specification language syntax includes various block constructs, denoted by "sin" and "sout," to reflect the flow of control between the component and the tester in a single-threaded setting. Particularly noteworthy is the use of "sin" statements in the context of a "callswitch," which allows the specification of non-deterministic choice between incoming calls.

In addition to interactions between the component and the tester, the specification also involves internal computations, such as computing values for communication and driving the test execution.

A successful execution of a test specification is one that does not generate a failure report. Failures can be caused by violated assert statements and where-clauses, as well as unspecified incoming method calls and returns. The paper includes an example of a failure caused by unspecified incoming method calls and returns.

The paper also proposes techniques to identify failures that arise from the tester object being unknown to the component and provides a runtime check to address this issue.

The paper discusses the syntax used for the specification language and provides code implementations for various scenarios. It also refers to previous related work such as the Message Sequence Charts (MSCs) and specification-based testing methods for object-oriented software.
