The presence of nearby inferred line groups is considered redundant. When there are no real lines near an inferred line group, the quality scores of the inferred lines are used to determine the most suitable line within the group to split the cells. To accomplish this, a simple moving average (SMA) of the quality scores is calculated for each group by examining both forward and backward two pixels. In cases where lines do not have a valid inferred line, a quality score of zero is assigned. The use of an SMA serves to mitigate the impact of noise in the image while addressing corner cases where a single pixel-thick inferred line may infiltrate between characters in a data set.

A proposed convolutional neural network (CNN) outputs the probability of merging two cells and determines whether one or both cells are empty. By leveraging a neural network to evaluate this information, the adverse effects of imperfections in the image can be substantially mitigated. Identifying which cells are empty is essential to avoid running optical character recognition (OCR) on unnecessary cells, thus enhancing performance, as OCR constitutes the most time-consuming step. The subsequent sections delve into the details of CNN implementation, training data, and post-CNN concatenation.

The primary objective of this branch is to detect improper cellular splits. Intuitively, the pixels where the cells merge and the surrounding pixels contain critical information regarding whether the cells should be merged. Due to the significance of this information and the limited input, more complex neural network layers are employed in this branch, consisting of five convolutional layers, each with nodes indicating whether the two cells contain data. The third node is activated when two cells should be merged. The initial dropout layers help guide the network away from relying solely on a single branch, while all the dropout layers collectively aid in preventing overfitting that could arise due to the limited training data.
