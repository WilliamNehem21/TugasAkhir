The paper presents a novel approach for intelligent and efficient query processing to facilitate semantic mediation in information systems. The proposed method utilizes a generic multi-agent architecture to support the approach, focusing on employing intelligent agents for query reformulation and leveraging new technology for semantic representation. The algorithm is designed to adapt to changes in the environment, offers broad applicability, and dynamically resolves various data conflicts. It accomplishes query reformulation using schema mediation for discovered systems and context mediation for other systems.

The authors evaluate existing approaches in the field, highlighting limitations such as incomplete integration processes and the reliance on assumptions or expert intervention. They also discuss related works that utilize extended schema mediation and ontologies for integration, emphasizing the need for better transparency and automated resolution of semantic value conflicts.

Furthermore, the paper introduces a multi-agent system designed for semantic interoperability and conflict resolution in evolving ontology domains, particularly focusing on electronic commerce applications. The proposed approach emphasizes technologies for semantic representation and high automation in query processing, indicating adaptability to environmental changes.

The multi-agent architecture includes intelligent agents (IAs) and routing agents (RAs). IAs act as intermediaries between information systems and the semantic mediation environment, playing roles as information suppliers and/or consumers. RAs facilitate context mediation and organize IAs based on semantic proximity, improving query processing efficiency.

The paper also outlines a protocol for dynamic query resolution, enabling intelligent agents to dynamically integrate and collaborate with information suppliers. Additionally, the authors describe the use of OWL DL as a common data model and present definitions for contextual information and query language within the proposed architecture.

Finally, the authors discuss the steps involved in query reformulation and transmission within the proposed framework, emphasizing the cooperation protocols for static and dynamic query resolution. They also articulate the necessity for semantic similarity comparisons and entity mappings between intelligent agents, providing a comprehensive overview of the proposed approach for semantic mediation in information systems.
