Aims of the Study and Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a common form of cancer globally, is influenced by polymorphisms in the tp53 gene. This study aims to explore the role of the arg72pro polymorphism of tp53 in the development of HCC in chronic hepatitis C patients with varying degrees of liver disease.

Subjects and Methods: The study included 69 HCC patients, 101 liver cirrhosis (LC) patients, and 46 healthy, age-matched volunteers as controls from the same area in Egypt. The HCC and LC patients were infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). The arg72pro polymorphism of codon 72 was analyzed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction enzyme digestion (PCR-RFLP).

TP53, located on chromosome 17p13.1, encodes a 53-kDa nuclear phosphoprotein that plays a key role in maintaining genome integrity. Mutations and polymorphisms in the TP53 gene have been linked to cancer. The codon 72 polymorphism, located in exon 4 of the TP53 gene, results in the substitution of an arginine residue with a proline residue. The study aimed to investigate the association between the TP53 arg72pro polymorphism and the risk of HCC in HCV-infected patients.

The study included newly diagnosed HCC and LC patients with HCV infection, recruited from the clinics of the Tropical Medicine Department, Mansoura University. Informed consent was obtained from all participants, and ethical and scientific approval was granted by local health authorities.

HCC diagnosis was confirmed using sonography, high-resolution contrast computed tomography, and liver biopsy, with histological evaluation using hematoxylin and eosin and Mason trichrome stains. The LC patients without evidence of HCC were selected based on histological or clinical, laboratory, and endoscopic findings.

Discussion: The study highlights the urgent need to identify molecular markers for predicting the course of HCC and developing effective therapies. Inactivation of the TP53 gene, mainly through mutations, is a key factor in the development of HCC. The overexpression of TP53 in early-stage HCC and its downregulation in the late stage suggest its involvement in multiple steps of HCC development. Further research with a larger sample size and classification of HCC stages is necessary to resolve these contradictory findings.
