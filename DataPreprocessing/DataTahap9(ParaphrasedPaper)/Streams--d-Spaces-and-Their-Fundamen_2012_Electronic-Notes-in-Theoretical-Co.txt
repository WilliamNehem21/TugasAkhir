The concept of fundamental category is derived from an adaptation of the conventional concept of fundamental groupoid. It is possible to define the fundamental category of a (locally) partially ordered space, d-space, or stream by following a consistent pattern in each case, which leads to a theorem akin to the van Kampen theorem. This paper briefly outlines the construction process within a general framework, ultimately presenting a unified proof for the van Kampen theorem.

Proof: The underlying Hausdorff space of y and the continuous map q are provided by lemma 3.9, and the relation on y is the smallest closed reflexive relation on y that allows q to be transformed into a morphism of w.

Conclusively, the section demonstrates that the notion of pospace is rather inflexible with regard to the fundamental category invariant. Specifically, there exists a unique (up to isomorphism) pospace whose fundamental category is the standard poset [0, 1]. Conversely, there are at least two non-isomorphic d-spaces whose fundamental category is the standard poset [0, 1], due to the loose binding between the topology and the collection of directed paths in a d-space.

The paper also presents a counter-example, illustrating that this situation is not anomalous, as it arises when a linear process (i.e., containing neither loops nor forks) generates a new process that is reduced to a loop. In such a case, a directed segment should also exist, with one end attached to the vortex. The vortex represents the state where the new process is created.
