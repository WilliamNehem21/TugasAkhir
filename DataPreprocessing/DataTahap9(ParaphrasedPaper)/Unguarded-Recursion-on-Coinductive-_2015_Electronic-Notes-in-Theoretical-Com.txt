The paper examines a model of processes with side effects, which is constructed by starting from a monad representing base effects and adding free operations using a cofree coalgebra construction. This gives rise to types of non-wellfounded side-effecting trees, which can be seen as generalizations of the infinite resumption monad. The paper discusses the attention that such types have received in recent literature, particularly their admission of guarded iteration. Furthermore, the paper demonstrates that these types also allow unguarded iteration, meaning they form complete elgot monads, as long as the underlying base effect supports unguarded iteration.

The concept of guardedness is defined in terms of the additional structure of a monad, which allows for the distinguishing of terms beginning with an operation from mere variables. Guardedness implies that recursive calls can only occur under a free operation. The paper notes that similar results on guarded recursion can be found in the literature.

The motivation for these results is to liberate non-wellfounded recursive definitions from the standard guardedness constraint. The paper illustrates an example wherein, given the completeness of the elgot monad, unrestricted while loops can be written instead of having to assume guards in all loop iterations.

The paper also discusses Moggi's notion of computation formalized as a strong monad over a cartesian category, and highlights the use of a distributive category with finite products and coproducts for supporting the constructions in the main object of study.

In addition, the paper recalls the definition of the coinductive generalized resumption transformer and presents the main result of the study - the stability of the class of complete elgot monads under this construction. This is proven in the paper through Theorem 4.5.
