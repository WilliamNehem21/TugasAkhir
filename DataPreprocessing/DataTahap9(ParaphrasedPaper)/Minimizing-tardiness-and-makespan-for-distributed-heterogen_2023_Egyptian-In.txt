This study addresses the distributed heterogeneous unrelated parallel machine scheduling problem (DHUPMSP) with the objective of minimizing total tardiness (TDD) and makespan. To tackle this complex optimization problem, the study proposes a knowledge and Pareto-based memetic algorithm (KPMA) with several key features: 
1. Design of four heuristic rules, including the shortest processing time rule, minimum factory workload rule, minimum machine finish time rule, and earliest due date rule. Additionally, a hybrid heuristic initialization is developed to create a population with high convergence and diversity.
2. Introduction of four problem feature-based heuristic neighborhood structures to enhance the success rate of local search.
3. Development of a simple elite strategy to improve the utilization of historical elite solutions.

The proposed KPMA is evaluated against five state-of-the-art algorithms on 20 instances with different scales. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the hybrid heuristic initialization efficiently conserves computational resources to enhance initialization convergence, knowledge-based neighborhood structures significantly accelerate exploration, and the elite strategy improves the diversity of the final non-dominated solutions set. The KPMA outperforms existing algorithms and demonstrates robust capabilities in solving DHUPMSP.

The remaining sections of the study are structured as follows: 
- Section 2 provides an overview of recent works related to the DHUPMSP.
- Section 3 presents the problem description and mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model for DHUPMSP.
- Section 4 details the proposed KPMA approach.
- Section 5 showcases the results of detailed numerical experiments.
- Section 6 concludes the study and outlines future research directions.

The study identifies the DHUPMSP as a challenging problem due to its distributed nature, and the limited existing research addressing it. It also discusses the application of memetic algorithms in shop scheduling problems and outlines the framework of memetic algorithms. Based on these discussions, the study presents the proposed KPMA, emphasizing the efficient initialization and effective local search strategies designed to address the limitations of previous works.

Ultimately, the study introduces a comprehensive conclusion based on the proposed KPMA's design, demonstrating its capability to efficiently converge and improve the efficiency of local search while maintaining diversity.

The work concludes by highlighting the success of the KPMA, attributing it to its design, including the hybrid heuristic initialization, problem feature-based neighborhood, and the elite strategy. This approach significantly outperforms existing algorithms in terms of convergence and diversity in obtaining Pareto solutions.

Furthermore, the study includes details of the numerical experiments carried out to test the effectiveness of KPMA, providing information on the experimental setup and hardware environment used. The study's primary contributors are listed, detailing their roles in the research process.
