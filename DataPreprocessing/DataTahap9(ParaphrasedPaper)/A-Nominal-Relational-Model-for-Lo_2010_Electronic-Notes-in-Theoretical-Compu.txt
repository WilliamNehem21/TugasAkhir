The theory of nominal sets deals with concepts related to names, freshness, and binders. It has been proposed as a potential framework for modeling local stores due to its simpler development compared to traditional presheaf models. However, existing models for local stores, including nominal sets, ultimately resort to presheaf models when addressing the crucial principle of relational reasoning. In this paper, we demonstrate how relational reasoning can be effectively modeled using nominal sets. We present a relational model for local stores within nominal sets, based on a model proposed by Pitts and Shinwell, in which types are interpreted as relations. This relational interpretation encapsulates the relational reasoning principle for local stores in a manner that was previously achieved using a family of relations for each type. Additionally, the relational model illustrates that the relations themselves constitute a model, potentially leading to the development of more robust models. Leveraging the relational model, we establish a relational parametricity principle for the operation of allocating local stores and show how it implies the relational reasoning principle.

In Section 3, we employ atom abstraction in nominal sets to model the type [ab]t(x), which represents computations in t(x) with a bound name of a reference cell of type b. We adopt a CPS-style semantics, as it simplifies the interpretation of allocation, assuming a nominal set r of results with a trivial permutation action. Additionally, each sort b is interpreted as a set, considered as a nominal set with a trivial permutation action. We define a relation in a span form, denoted as arel, using the inclusion of sets into both these nominal sets.

Proposition 4.4 is proven through induction over the typing rules, with most cases following from the interpretation of fine-grained cbv using cartesian closed structure and the monad. The cases related to operations for local store are derived from Theorem 5.1. Furthermore, with a suitable generalization of Theorem 5.1 that incorporates vectors of update, lookup, and new operations on each side, one can establish the soundness of relational reasoning using relations between vectors of cells. Detailed information regarding these aspects will be included in future publications.
