We examine a deterministic probabilistic real-time automata model of real-time systems, with only nondeterministic choice for times, which is a subset of probabilistic real-time automata. The expanded logic pwdc comprises formulas that represent the conditions for the likelihood of satisfying a wdc formula by a set of adversaries within the model of a deterministic probabilistic real-time automaton for a specified observation interval. Subsequently, we develop methodologies for verifying deterministic probabilistic real-time automata for a specific subclass of pwdc formulas.

In this section, we introduce linear occurrence invariants (loi) and outline an algorithm for verifying a real-time automaton for loi using integer programming. We utilize wdc to define loi. We will revisit wdc when introducing probabilistic wdc in the following section. For now, we consider wdc formulas as dc formulas with the addition that a term can also denote the number of occurrences of a state variable, and assume that multiple state changes can occur simultaneously.
