This study is influenced by two recent developments: the emergence of a categorical understanding of Bayesian inversion and learning, and the categorical reconstruction of relative entropy. The paper aims to provide a categorical treatment of entropy following the approach of Baez and Fritz, specifically in the context of standard Borel spaces, to explore the role of entropy in learning.

The second development provides a robust framework for constructing natural transformations, with the aspiration of using these concepts to comprehend Bayesian inversion in machine learning. This aspiration has been realized in a novel manner. These studies are conducted in the setting of standard Borel spaces and are built on the Giry monad.

The contribution of this work is to extend the theory of Baez et al. to standard Borel spaces, as their work is limited to finite sets. While their work provides a conceptual direction, it offers little assistance in the actual development of the mathematical theory. Therefore, the authors had to rebuild the mathematical framework and find appropriate analogues for concepts relevant to the finite case.

The paper begins with a review of some background, assuming the reader's familiarity with concepts from topology, measure theory, and basic category theory. Useful references for this background include books by Ash, Billingsley, and Dudley.

The authors define a standard Borel space as a measurable space obtained by disregarding the topology of a Polish space while retaining its Borel algebra. The category of standard Borel spaces uses measurable functions as morphisms, denoted as stbor.

The proof demonstrates that a function satisfies certain properties on a subcategory called finstat, and then establishes that this function extends uniquely to another subcategory called sbstat.

The authors have delivered a categorical characterization of relative entropy on standard Borel spaces, expanding the scope of the original work by Baez et al. However, the primary motivation is to examine the role of entropy arguments in machine learning. While entropy arguments have been used in ad-hoc ways in machine learning, recent work by Danos and colleagues provides a mathematically well-defined framework to understand Bayesian inversion and its relationship with entropy. The most recent paper in this series adopts a point-free approach introduced in previous work, and the authors express interest in extending their definitions to a point-free situation.
