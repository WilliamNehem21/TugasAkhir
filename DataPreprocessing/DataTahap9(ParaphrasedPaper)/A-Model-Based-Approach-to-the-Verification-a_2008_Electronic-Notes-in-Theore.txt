This paper introduces a method for verifying and adapting software components and services built with Windows Workflow Foundation (WF). To begin, the paper outlines an abstract description of WF workflows and formalizes the extraction of labeled transition systems (LTS) from these workflows. It then demonstrates the application of verification and adaptation using model-checking techniques and existing model-based adaptation approaches, respectively. Furthermore, the paper explains the generation of a WF workflow from an adaptor protocol.

The study of software adaptation is a promising research area aimed at supporting the construction of component systems by repurposing software entities to fit specific needs within different systems. The paper notes that many model-based adaptation approaches concentrate on behavioral interoperability and the generation of adaptors to address mismatches in a non-intrusive manner. The study also emphasizes the importance of automation in generating adaptor protocols, offering comparisons with existing programming languages and platforms.

The remainder of the paper is organized to provide an overview of WF, define an abstract notation for WF workflows, present a practical example of an online computer sale relying on WF components, formalize the extraction of LTS from WF workflows, concentrate on the verification and adaptation of WF components, encode an adaptor LTS into a WF workflow, and compare the contributions of the proposed approach.

Moreover, the paper highlights the relevance of WF, its supported programming languages, as well as specific activities within the WF framework. It also discusses the challenges and guidelines for encoding adaptor LTS into abstract workflows and explores related works on automated generation and verification of adaptors in BPEL processes.

In conclusion, the paper illustrates the potential of the proposed approach in verifying WF components and generating adaptor protocols, demonstrating its practical application on a realistic example. The study suggests that software adaptation can be valuable for widely used implementation platforms such as the .NET Framework 3.0, aiding developers in building software applications through the reuse of components or services.
