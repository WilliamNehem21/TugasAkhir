The paper demonstrates that the Lin rough membership function is equivalent to the R-rough membership function. Additionally, it asserts that our L-rough (or I-rough) membership function is more precise than both the R-rough and Lin rough membership functions. Furthermore, it suggests that the J-near rough membership function can also be utilized, as exemplified in example 5.1.
