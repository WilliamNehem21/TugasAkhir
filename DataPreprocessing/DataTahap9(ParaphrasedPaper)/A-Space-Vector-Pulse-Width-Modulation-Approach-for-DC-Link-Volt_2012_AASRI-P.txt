The equilibrium of the neutral point can be established through the use of an algorithm that controls the inverter by switching it to appropriate states, thereby achieving balance in the dc-link. An approach employing stationary feed-forward space vector pulse width modulation (SVPWM) has been utilized by Josep Pou et al. for dc-link balancing, involving complex duty cycle calculations. Jian-Yong Zheng et al. have proposed a new modulation technique based on the virtual vector concept for comprehensive control of dc-link balancing in a 3-level 3-phase NPC VSI, ensuring dc-link voltage balance across the full modulation range. However, this method has only been implemented using carrier-based pulse width modulation (PWM), necessitating the calculation of angles and trigonometric ratios. A complete control of the 3-level 3-phase NPC inverter has been achieved by Amit Kumar Gupta et al., with the scheme relying entirely on modulation index and reference vector angle.

DC-link imbalance predominantly stems from medium vectors, as non-zero phase currents in those vectors hinder the achievement of capacitor balance. To mitigate this, Du Toit Mouton et al. have proposed that an appropriate utilization of short, zero, and large vectors, while avoiding medium vectors, can facilitate the balancing of the capacitor.
