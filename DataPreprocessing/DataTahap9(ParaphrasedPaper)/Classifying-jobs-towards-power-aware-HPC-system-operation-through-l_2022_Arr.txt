The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides an introduction to the k computer, detailing the file I/O subsystems and electric power-related metrics. Section 3 presents a correlation analysis based on job stats log data, while Section 4 discusses a prediction model using a machine learning approach. Section 5 explores related work, and the paper concludes with Section 6, which outlines future work plans.

In the context of the k computer, the local file system (LFS) and global file system (GFS) were utilized for specific purposes, with the former serving as a dedicated space for file I/O operations during computations and the latter used for storing programs and data with high redundancy. Additionally, an enhanced Lustre file system, referred to as the Fujitsu Exabyte File System (FEFS) based on Lustre version 1.8, was employed to construct both file systems of the k computer. The implementation of a two-level file system, in combination with an asynchronous file staging scheme, enhanced job scheduling efficiency and mitigated I/O interference.

The paper proposes that the ratio of disk utilization relative to the allocated disk space offers valuable insights into the file I/O status and associated activities of each job. It suggests that higher file I/O activities in high-performance computing (HPC) jobs indicate lower electric power levels, whereas higher computing activities in HPC jobs lead to increased electric power consumption. The authors conducted correlation coefficient evaluations using a Python module and three correlation functions provided by the Scipy package.

The Random Forest Classifier (RFC) yielded the highest correlation values, with about 0.945, 0.832, and 0.944 for the 1D, 3D (malleable), and all categories, respectively. However, the performances slightly degraded when the number of jobs in the 3D (malleable) and 3D (same) categories increased. This suggests that performing job classification separately in each node layout may be beneficial.

In the classification at 30 W, the model achieved high scores across the evaluated models in the 1D, 3D with layout changes, and all node layout cases. The authors concluded that the RFC was the best model for HPC job classifications in terms of electric power levels per compute node, particularly when appropriate threshold levels, such as 60 W or 30 W, are adopted.
