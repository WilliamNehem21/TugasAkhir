The untyped lambda calculus is frequently included in computer science curricula and can be taught in various courses, such as computability, semantics, functional programming, and programming language concepts. It serves as a fundamental computation model and a minimal functional programming language. Additionally, it can demonstrate the universality of a very small language by encoding arithmetic operations, data structures, and recursive function definitions.

In the context of the untyped lambda calculus, a free variable is analogous to a data constructor in languages like Standard ML or Haskell. For instance, when a free variable appears in a function position, the behavior of call-by-value reduction would entail reducing the argument expression, while call-by-name reduction would not. This aligns with the strictness of constructors in languages like ML and the non-strictness in languages like Haskell.

To generate a trace of the reduction process, the reduction functions described in a specific section of the paper need to be modified to accommodate an additional context argument. The extended substitution function, which takes the context as an argument, applies the context to the redex before contracting it. This modification allows for the construction of a reduction trace.

For experimental purposes, it may be beneficial to perform beta-reduction step by step. This can be achieved by introducing side effects in the meta-language, such as Standard ML. The context function is used to count the number of redexes contracted and set a step limit before the evaluation commences. Once the specified number of redexes have been contracted, the reduction is aborted, with the result being reported as the term obtained at that point. The process then restarts for each new step, giving the impression of reducing the term one step at a time.

The paper discusses a straightforward approach to implementing lambda calculus reduction by using big-step operational semantics to describe reduction strategies. The approach involves implementing reduction functions in Standard ML and incorporating instrumentation to produce a trace of the reduction using contexts. This method can be extended to accommodate other reduction strategies that are expressible using big-step operational semantics. However, extending the approach to incorporate lazy evaluation, whether through graph reduction or an explicit heap, would introduce complexity primarily due to the need to print the current graph or heap.
