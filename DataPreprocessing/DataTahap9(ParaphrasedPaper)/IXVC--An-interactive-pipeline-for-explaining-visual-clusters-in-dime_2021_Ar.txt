The paper discusses the application of dimensionality reduction (DR) techniques in machine learning, which are designed to reduce the number of features in high-dimensional (HD) data, allowing for easier visualization. The authors introduce a new machine learning pipeline called IXVC, which aims to aid data analysts in explaining DR visualizations through visual clusters. The paper also presents the tool that implements IXVC, along with examples of its use and the results of a user-based experiment evaluating its effectiveness. Furthermore, the paper discusses the limitations of IXVC, proposes directions for future work, and concludes with acknowledgments and author information.

The authors describe various challenges and techniques related to explaining visual clusters in DR visualizations, such as the use of decision trees and interactive analysis tools. They also discuss the importance of understanding the mapping between the original high-dimensional features and the resulting low-dimensional visualization. Additionally, the paper presents the results of an evaluation of the IXVC pipeline, showing its effectiveness in helping users explain visual clusters in DR visualizations.

The paper highlights the need for tools like IXVC to aid data analysts in understanding and interpreting DR visualizations, and it suggests future work in the development of educational tools and further analysis of the pipeline's use in different conditions. Finally, the paper provides information about the authors and acknowledges the support of the European Regional Development Fund for their project.
