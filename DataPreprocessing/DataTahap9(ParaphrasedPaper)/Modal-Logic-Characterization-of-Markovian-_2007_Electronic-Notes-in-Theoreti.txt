In our framework based on Markov processes, the combination of a process term and a test should be such that it only produces transitions whose rate can be represented by a positive real number corresponding to an exponential distribution. This requirement relies on the specific synchronization method being used. The most straightforward way to achieve this exponential closure is to adhere to the generative-reactive form of communication characteristic of Markov processes. This means that only passive actions can be involved in the tests, where passive actions do not have a duration associated with them. Instead, they are assigned positive real numbers as weights, which are used for probabilistic selection among a group of passive actions with the same name. The concept is that, in any state, a process term being tested proposes an action to be performed by holding a competition among the exponentially timed actions available in that state, after which the test responds by probabilistically choosing a passive action (if one exists) with the same name as the proposed exponentially timed action.
