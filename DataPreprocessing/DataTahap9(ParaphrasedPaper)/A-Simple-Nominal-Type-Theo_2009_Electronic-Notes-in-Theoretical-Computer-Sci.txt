While proof systems for traditional nominal logic have been thoroughly examined, there has been relatively little focus on constructive techniques. This paper introduces a straightforward type theory, referred to as SNTT, for nominal terms. SNTT incorporates standard unit, pair, and function types along with the names and name abstractions found in nominal logic. It is demonstrated that SNTT is both sound and strongly normalizing, and can be interpreted using nominal sets. Additionally, SNTT can be readily enhanced with recursion combinators to accommodate languages with simpler binding mechanisms, although they may be less expressive than those in prior systems. Further research is needed to explore extensions to more intricate type theories or broader segments of nominal logic.
