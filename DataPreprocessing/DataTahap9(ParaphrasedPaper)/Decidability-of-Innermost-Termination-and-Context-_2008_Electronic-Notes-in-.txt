The category of term rewriting systems (TRSs) that meet the criteria outlined in Theorem 5.8 is broader than the category of TRSs that meet the criteria outlined in Corollary 4.17. Furthermore, the group of semi-constructor TRSs and the group of TRSs that meet the conditions of Theorem 5.8 do not entirely encompass each other.

It is relatively straightforward to carry out the procedures outlined in the proofs of Theorems 3.9, 4.15, and 4.22. The group of semi-constructor TRSs is rather limited, accounting for approximately 3% of the TRSs in the termination problem database 4.0. Expanding the classes of problems that can be decided is conceivable if there is success in developing a technique for generating accurate approximations of DP-graphs.
