The interactions occurring within and between different omics levels create an extensive network that collaborates in various biological processes. For instance, gene networks control the production of protease, which in turn facilitates metabolic reactions such as lipid degradation. Graph-based deep learning (GDL) has recently provided new insights into the analysis of biological network data. The primary concept of GDL involves message passing, wherein node representations are updated through the aggregation of information from local node neighborhoods. While GDL has demonstrated strong performance in the analysis of biological networks, there has been limited research on the integration of biological networks with multi-omics data. In this study, we introduce Autoggn, a multimodal approach for integrating molecular interaction networks and omics data, with graph convolutional networks (GCNs) at its core. These networks are designed to uncover hidden patterns in omics data by employing message passing and aggregation across molecular interaction networks. We showcase the efficacy of Autoggn through three tasks: single-cell embryonic developmental stage classification, cancer type classification, and breast cancer subtyping. Autoggn outperformed XGBoost and MLP by 4.7% and 6.3%, respectively, on an independent test set, achieving an accuracy of 96.4%. Notably, Autoggn achieved higher accuracy than Autogenome (95.9%), a method based on recursive feature elimination, thereby demonstrating the potential of integrating molecular interaction networks with gene expression data.

Accurate prediction of cancer types is crucial for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. In recent years, machine learning methods have demonstrated significant success in cancer prognosis and prediction. Open-source cancer databases such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) offer researchers and clinicians large-scale multi-omics data for analysis. For instance, Autoggn achieved an accuracy of 98.4% on the test set by integrating gene expression data and mutation data with the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, outperforming Autoomics by 1.2%. This illustrates the potential of Autoggn in integrating multi-omics data with biological interaction networks.

Cancer is a complex set of diseases characterized by genetic heterogeneity, not only between different cancer types but also within them. This heterogeneity can lead to significant variations in patient responses to drugs or immune therapy, even within the same type of cancer. Therefore, precise cancer subtyping is essential to provide personalized treatment and improve patient care.

We evaluated Autoggn for breast cancer subtyping using two types of omics data: gene expression profiles and protein expression profiles. We acquired patient samples with breast cancer from TCGA and focused on four subtypes: luminal A, luminal B, triple-negative, and HER2-enriched, as per PAM50 profiling. The dataset included 396 patients, and the network input comprised 14,912 nodes and 3948,022 edges.

To address the interpretability challenge posed by neural networks, we employed the SHAP package to explain and visualize the feature importance of each gene in predicting the class. For instance, in the single-cell developmental stage classification task, we found that gene features closely related to embryonic development played a significant role in classification. These explainable results can aid researchers and other users in comprehending deep learning models and provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying omics data.

Apart from the aforementioned classification tasks, Autoggn can be applied to a wide range of biomedical tasks, including predicting the life expectancy of patients using the Cox proportional hazards model, identifying tissue- and age-specific biomarkers, and predicting drug sensitivity. We continue to explore further applications of Autoggn.

The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network data for humans (Homo sapiens) and mice (Mus musculus) was obtained from the STRING database, which includes known and predicted PPIs. For the breast cancer subtyping task, interactions with a confidence score lower than 0.1 were excluded to retain as many node features as possible due to the limited size of the protein expression data.

The data was median-centered across antibodies as an initial correction step, and no further preprocessing was performed. Due to the limited size of protein features, all features from the two types of omics data were retained, with missing gene expression or protein expression data set to 0. A PPI network consisting of 14,912 nodes and 3948,022 edges was extracted based on the omics data features.

For all tasks, 10% of the dataset was held out for testing, and 5-fold cross-validation was applied to the remaining data. Autoggn and baseline models (MLP, XGBoost, Autogenome, and Autoomics) were constructed using the training set, and the labels of the evaluation set were predicted for each of the five folds. This approach allowed us to assess the robustness of the models. The 5-fold cross-validation process was repeated five times to ensure accuracy, and the mean and standard deviation of the classification accuracy were reported. To determine the best hyperparameters for each model, a grid search was performed.

We utilized the SHAP package to estimate feature importance and explain the model's functionality. The best Autoggn model identified and trained on the training set was inputted into the SHAP module. The SHAP values of each feature for each sample were obtained, and the feature importance score for each class was derived based on the summed SHAP values.

Various reports, including classification reports and confusion matrices, were generated and saved based on specified paths. Additionally, the best model was saved, and a model prediction module was employed to predict the independent test dataset. Finally, an explanation module was utilized to interpret the classification results by reporting important features contributing to each category, based on SHAP explanations.
