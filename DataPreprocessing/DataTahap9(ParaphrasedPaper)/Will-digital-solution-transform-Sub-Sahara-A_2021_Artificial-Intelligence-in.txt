While improving decision-making in agriculture is a challenging endeavor, digital advancements have the potential to revolutionize the sector and address pressing issues such as climate variability, food insecurity, malnutrition, and environmental degradation. The use of digital technologies can provide effective solutions by facilitating instant information exchange and access to new information, thereby enhancing user benefits.

Digitalization for agriculture (D4Ag), which involves the application of digital breakthroughs across various agricultural value chains, can help overcome challenges in agricultural activities and contribute to the increased earnings of smallholder farmers, food and nutrition security, climate change adaptation, and the involvement of youth and women in the sector. By utilizing digital tools and channels, D4Ag accelerates information dissemination to smallholder farmers and other agricultural value chain actors, including extension agents, agri-input dealers, agribusinesses, financial service providers, and policymakers. These tools encompass a wide range of digital solutions, from basic voice and text-based advisory on feature phones to advanced tools such as satellites, sensors, and big data analytics.

A comprehensive review of research literature, including original research articles, peer-reviewed articles, working papers, conference papers, book chapters, and various databases, found that the development of the agribusiness sector in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) lags behind the size of farming activities in most countries. Many SSA countries heavily rely on the export of agricultural commodities, with minimal or no processing involved. Additionally, a significant portion of African farmers still struggle to access real-time marketing and price information, hindering their ability to make informed decisions about their produce.

Digital connectivity and information communication technology (ICT) innovations offer opportunities for efficiency gains and improved resource management in agricultural value chains. By enabling stronger networks between firms, ICTs foster new creative and innovative activities and could potentially alter the interaction of small firms with markets, facilitating new business models and innovation at scale. Research findings indicate that the adoption of smartphones among horticultural smallholder farmers in Kenya led to increased knowledge flows, navigation of chain alternatives, and emerging digital markets, highlighting the potential of digital technologies in agricultural development.

Limited access to financial services remains a challenge in SSA, with mobile money services showing varying levels of success across different countries. Despite the potential for digital payments to improve customer well-being, the uneven adoption and use of mobile money services in SSA have had a positive impact on financial inclusion in the region.

Moreover, digital gender disparities persist, with evidence suggesting that women could benefit significantly from access to mobile phones and digital information. However, connectivity may not benefit all and could lead to power imbalances among different types of firms. Additionally, digital agricultural solutions face barriers to adoption and scale-up, with many innovations struggling to achieve broader acceptance in the region.

To fully harness the opportunities of digitalization in agriculture, SSA countries need to address digital infrastructure and literacy challenges, as well as bridge the digital divide. Strategies to facilitate affordable access to digital tools for agriculture and ensure fair pricing for mobile data baskets, particularly for smallholder farmers, will be crucial. Additionally, regulatory and delivery approaches must be balanced to facilitate different categories of services and operators, while investments in digital agriculture enabling tools and infrastructure are essential to support the successful scaling of digital agricultural solutions.
