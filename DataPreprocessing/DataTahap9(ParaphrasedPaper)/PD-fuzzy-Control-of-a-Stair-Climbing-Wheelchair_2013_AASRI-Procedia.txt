According to the disability prevalence estimation data from 2010/2011 in Great Britain, there are a total of 11.2 million disabled individuals, including 0.8 million children, 5.2 million working adults, and 5.2 million individuals above the pension age. This has led to a high demand for various means of transport, with wheelchairs continuing to play a crucial role. This paper describes common mobility assistive techniques and recent advancements in curb and stair climbing devices, as well as a proposal for a high step stair-climbing wheelchair.

Different types of stair-climbing wheelchairs have varying mechanical designs across three categories: crawler type, wheeled type, and legged type. Crawler types utilize non-slip rubber track mechanisms with fuzzy logic control for optimal tension estimation, but they face limitations in narrow spaces and may exert high pressure on stairs. Wheeled types, on the other hand, lack extensive stability control and often rely on inverse kinematic derivation for motion planning. A legged mechanism introduced in 2011 utilizes a supporting polygon to maintain the wheelchair body level, but it may not be practical for use on stairs with more than two steps or a steep slope.

In the development of a stair-climbing wheelchair, a humanoid model with a 1.5 m height and approximately 71 kg weight is approximated and designed, following standard dimensions and structures for safe maneuverability, as recommended by the Canadian Centre for Occupational Safety and Health. The wheelchair system is successfully designed and tested for climbing straight stairs with specific dimensions, with a proposed fuzzy control approach showing effective performance in controlling the system during stair climbing.

Future work will focus on optimizing the control system for stairs descending, as well as fine-tuning the control scaling parameters and linear motion. This research builds on previous work in robotic locomotion, such as a study presented at the IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems in 2005, which explored walking up and down stairs using a biped locomotor with parallel mechanisms.
