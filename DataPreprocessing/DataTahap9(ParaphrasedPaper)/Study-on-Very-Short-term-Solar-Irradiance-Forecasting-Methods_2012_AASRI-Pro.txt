The power output of a solar photovoltaic (PV) power station fluctuates due to the varying and intermittent nature of solar irradiance, posing challenges for accurate power output forecasting. Traditional forecasting technologies combining physical/statistical models with numerical weather prediction (NWP) have failed to produce reliable results. This paper presents a method for very short-term solar irradiance forecasting based on ground-based cloud image analysis using the Total Sky Imager (TSI). The method involves cloud recognition, cloud blocking prediction, distortion correction, projection transformation, and integration with cloud forcing analysis. The theoretical analysis suggests that this method can yield reasonably accurate forecasting results and has broad applicability.

The intermittent and random nature of surface solar irradiation directly contributes to fluctuations in PV output power, presenting difficulties for power system stability and forecasting. Accurate PV power forecasting is crucial for optimizing grid dispatching and ensuring power quality, which can lead to cost reductions and the optimal utilization of solar resources for both social and economic benefits.

Previous research suggests that cloud obstruction is a primary factor in the intermittency of solar irradiance. By observing and analyzing cloud images, predicting cloud blocking, and assessing cloud forcing effects, it is possible to forecast solar irradiance effectively.

This paper outlines the workflow for solar irradiance forecasting and the collection of cloud image data, followed by the discussion of cloud blocking prediction techniques using online cloud image data. The processes of cloud recognition, annotation, and prediction of cloud motion trends are presented, as well as the necessity for distortion correction and projection transformation to ensure accurate forecasting results.

The cloud recognition process involves image loading and graying, image filtering, and threshold segmentation to distinguish clouds from clear blue sky. OpenCV, a widely used open-source computer vision tool suite, is employed to implement the algorithms for these processes. By representing cloud images as two-dimensional matrices and predicting cloud motion trends, it is possible to forecast the blocking of solar radiation by clouds.

Although the area of clouds in the TSI images may be distorted due to the imaging principle of the TSI, distortion correction and projection transformation procedures are necessary to ensure the accuracy and consistency of the cloud image during the prediction calculation. These procedures aim to correct the area of the objective cloud to align with actual observation results and ensure reliable solar irradiance forecasting.
