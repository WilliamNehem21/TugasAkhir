The field of computer-assisted drug design (CADD) has made significant advancements and is continually evolving. CADD techniques can be broadly categorized into structure-based drug design (SBDD) and ligand-based drug design (LBDD), depending on the availability of protein/target and ligand structures, respectively. The concept of artificial intelligence (AI) was introduced by John McCarthy in 1956 to refer to the creation of intelligent machines. AI revolves around the ability of machines to perform intelligent tasks.

One approach to address the challenges posed by limited data is through the application of few-shot learning (FSL). FSL can be utilized in various types of data for supervised learning problems, such as classification, regression, and semi or unsupervised learning. FSL has the potential to significantly improve the performance of models compared to conventional approaches, particularly in the field of drug discovery.

Researchers have explored different techniques to leverage FSL in drug discovery, including the use of deep neural networks, meta-learning frameworks, and generative modeling. These approaches have shown promise in addressing the limitations of limited labeled data, enhancing predictions, and facilitating efficient molecular property and biological activity prediction.

Studies have also addressed specific challenges in drug discovery, such as predicting drug synergy, identifying potential drug candidates targeting specific proteins, and improving the prediction of antimicrobial peptides. These advancements demonstrate the potential of FSL in addressing critical issues in drug discovery and have implications for precision medicine, personalized drug selection, and accelerating the identification of potential drug candidates.

However, as FSL becomes more prominent in drug discovery, ethical considerations and the need for regulatory acceptance and validation of FSL models may arise. Additionally, the complexity and comparability of FSL models across different datasets pose challenges. It is crucial to continue exploring and refining FSL methodologies for achieving better predictive performance and addressing critical endpoints in drug discovery.

Overall, the emerging significance of representation learning approaches in FSL tasks holds promise for advancing drug discovery and computational medicinal chemistry. Expanding research in crucial areas such as scaffold generalization and explainable machine learning can further enhance the capabilities of FSL models in drug discovery, leading to more reliable and cost-effective drug development.
