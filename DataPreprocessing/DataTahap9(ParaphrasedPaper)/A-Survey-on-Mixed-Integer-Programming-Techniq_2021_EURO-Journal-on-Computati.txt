Finally, we would like to mention previous extensive reviews and literature on the subject of bilevel optimization. Early surveys and books in the field include works such as Anandalingam and Friesz (1992), Ben-Ayed (1993), Kolstad (1985), Vicente and Calamai (1994), and Wen and Hsu (1991), which focus on linear bilevel optimization. Additionally, bilevel optimization problems can be traced back to the influential publications on leader-follower games by von Stackelberg (1934, 1952), with the formulation first appearing in the context of a military application regarding the cost-minimal mix of weapons in Bracken and McGill (1973). Another early discussion of multilevel, or two-level problems, can be found in Candler and Norton (1977). Over time, bilevel optimization has been recognized as an important modeling tool due to its ability to formalize hierarchical decision processes that are prevalent in application areas such as energy, security, and revenue management. In the next sections, we will delve deeper into specific applications and discuss various problem classes, their properties, and the algorithms used to solve them. We also present potential future research directions.

We highlight selected applications from diverse fields to illustrate the significance of studying bilevel problems. Subsequently, in section 3, we delve into bilevel optimization problems with linear or convex lower-level problems, exploring their fundamental properties, classical single-level reformulations, and an extensive overview of the algorithms utilized to address these problems. Section 4 focuses on bilinear bilevel problems, specifically analyzing pricing problems and Stackelberg games. In section 5, we shift our attention to bilevel problems involving mixed-integer (non)linear lower-level problems, examining their general properties before discussing generic approaches for solving bilevel mixed-integer linear programs (MILPs) and mixed-integer nonlinear programs (MINLPs). Section 6 is dedicated to interdiction problems, encompassing both discrete and continuous interdiction problems, various application domains, and different classes of algorithms to address these issues. We conclude the survey with a collection of potential research avenues and directions in section 7.

We acknowledge that due to the extensive number of publications on applications of bilevel optimization, this review is not exhaustive. Other application-oriented papers can be found in the surveys by Dempe (2020) and by Sinha et al. (2018b). Additionally, we discuss the application of bilevel problems in the context of statistics and machine learning, such as the work by Bennett et al. (2006) and Sinha et al. (2014) on hyper-parameter selection for statistical learning methods, and the framework introduced by Franceschi et al. (2018) based on bilevel programming. Moreover, we highlight the modeling of gradient-based electrical services as a bilevel MILP by Poirion et al. (2020), who develop a generic branch-and-cut procedure applicable to similar types of bilevel constraints. Furthermore, we expound on various methodologies proposed to solve bilevel problems and their computational implications. We also make reference to studies on algorithmic techniques tailored to bilevel problems, emphasizing recent developments in this area.

We conclude this section by mentioning the critical importance of developing tailored algorithms for solving bilevel problems, and we provide brief insight into the implications and applications of local methods. Additionally, we touch on the development of branch-and-bound schemes specific to bilevel problems, including the use of complementarity conditions to obtain disjunctive cuts and the implementation of classical MPCC regularization techniques. We also discuss the computation of locally optimal solutions of linear bilevel problems based on the KKT reformulation, as well as the computation of stationary points achieved through feasible region properties. This extensive review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the existing literature on bilevel optimization, including its applications, methodologies, and potential areas for future investigation.
