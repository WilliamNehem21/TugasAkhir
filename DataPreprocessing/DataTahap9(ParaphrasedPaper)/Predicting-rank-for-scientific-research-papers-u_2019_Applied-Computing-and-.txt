The future development of any system, particularly in scientific research, is heavily reliant on automatic data processing. This paper presents an automatic classification method used in scientific research as a supervised learning task. The study identifies key features that play a significant role in predicting the new rank under a supervised learning setup. It provides an overview of previous work in ranking scientific research papers and evaluates and compares state-of-the-art classification methods, including supervised, semi-supervised, and non-supervised learning. The preliminary tests showed good performance on a realistic corpus, and the study compares performance metrics to define the influential features. The paper also discusses the use of SMO and KStar classifiers, which represent a neural network with nodes and edges as papers and citations between authors. This choice is due to research paper networks being a concrete example of collaboration between research communities. The related work section gives an overview of approaches and methods for classifying scientific research papers, and introduces a novel approach for predicting future rankings based on existing papers. The rest of the paper is organized into sections that review related work, state of the art for learning methods, describe methods, present results and discussion, and conclude with future research directions. The paper also emphasizes the limitations of relevant and important ranking algorithms and describes a non-supervised context for performing generic tasks of supervised learning. The researchers also mention the need for data pre-processing to extract only relevant information from the Web of Science dataset. The final section provides the citation for the paper in question.
