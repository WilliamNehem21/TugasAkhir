The authors present significant basic information about recursive coalgebras, with a main focus on their emergence from comonads, comonad-coalgebras, and distributive laws in section 4, which is the primary section of the paper. In section 5, the paper concludes by highlighting potential areas for future research.

The concept of very recursiveness in relation to coalgebras can be likened to the role of allowing primitive recursion in connection to initiality for algebras. Recent work by Adamek, Milius, and Velebil has advanced the understanding of the free completely iterative (or iterative) monad of a functor, expanding upon their earlier approach. This work is centered on the dual concept, or a finitary version thereof.

The authors have established theorem 4.4, which offers a broad generalization of the central theorem pertaining to structured recursion schemes for initial algebras that can be derived from comonads, as well as the dual result cited previously. It is noted that in another work, the substitution and solution theorems were derived from this result. In fact, the previously mentioned theorem is a specific instance of theorem 4.4.
