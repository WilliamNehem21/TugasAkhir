This study introduces a novel high-voltage nLDMOS device incorporating FODS structures in the bulk region to evaluate its ESD reliability. The inclusion of FOD structures in the bulk area significantly enhances the anti-ESD capability of these 60V nLDMOS devices, resulting in an average IT2 value improvement ranging from 1.12% to 111.74% compared to the reference group value. It is essential to consider that the trigger voltage of a device under test (DUT) should not be excessively small and should not fall below the operation voltage of 60V as the FOD structure occupancy area increases. Therefore, the addition of FODS in the bulk region remarkably enhances the ESD resistance; however, it is crucial to be mindful of the maximum FODS area limitation.
