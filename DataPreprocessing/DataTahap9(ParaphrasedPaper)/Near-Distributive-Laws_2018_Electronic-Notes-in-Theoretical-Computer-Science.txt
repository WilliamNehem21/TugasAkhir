We are not aware of any nontrivial monad that can have a distributive law with every other monad. This limitation restricts the applicability of distributive laws in programming. Instead, we explore the concept of monads that can have nearly distributive laws with every other monad, which we refer to as "amenable" monads, and we present examples of such monads.
