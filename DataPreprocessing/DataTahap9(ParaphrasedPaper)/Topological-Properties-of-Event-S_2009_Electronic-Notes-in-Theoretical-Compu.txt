In this note, we discuss the application of algebraic topology to the study of mathematical structures that model concurrency, finitary coherent domains, and event structures. These discussions are part of a larger investigation into the finite labeling problem for event structures, and we aim to demonstrate the geometric questions that naturally arise within this context.

We begin by considering the restriction to an antichain of the graph of an event structure of degree 2, and then extend this idea to event structures of higher degree, identifying a family of graphs that are avoided on antichains. These graphs are constructed iteratively using cones and suspensions, imparting them with a geometrical nature. Consequently, we transition from a graph-theoretic perspective to instead consider the clique complex of the graph of an event structure. In the case of degree 3, we prove that one-dimensional spheres (cycles) cannot occur on antichains unless they are boundaries, leading to an explicit computation of the homology groups of antichains of event structures of degree 3, demonstrating their triviality in all dimensions greater than zero.

The traditional definition of event structures already suggests that they can be viewed as ordered simplicial complexes, and the results we present serve as evidence of the fundamental connection between topology and concurrency. However, a comprehensive understanding of this approach, based on the notion of ordered simplicial complexes, in comparison to other topological analyses of concurrent computation, is yet to be fully elucidated, providing ample scope for future research.

The note is organized as follows: the first section establishes the background for our discussions, including domains and event structures, elements from trace theory, and the finite labeling problem, presenting the graph of an event structure and the rationale behind our study of these graphs with a fixed clique number. In the second section, we present certain graphs that are excluded from antichains of this class of graphs. The third section employs these considerations to determine the homology groups of the clique complexes of graphs with a clique number of 3. In the final section, we formally define the homology of an event structure, outline some conjectures, and propose future research directions.

The diagram posits two implications, with the first implying that if qac= qca and qabc= qacb= qcab= qcba, then qab= qba, qbc= qcb, and qbac= qbca. We leave the second implication to the reader's discretion. We assert that r is coherent if and only if the implication becomes more interesting, although it is trivially observed that every graph can be realized as the concurrency graph of some event structure. However, not every graph conforms to the form g(e); there are many constraints, for instance, minimal elements form a clique with respect to equality. Additionally, motivated by the finite labeling problem, we can show that certain well-known graphs with a clique number of 3 and an increasing coloring number do not occur as subgraphs of some graph in the form g(e).
