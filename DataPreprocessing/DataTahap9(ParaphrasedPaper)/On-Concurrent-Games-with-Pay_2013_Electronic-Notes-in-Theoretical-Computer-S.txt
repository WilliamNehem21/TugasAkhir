Games have been widely used as a tool in various fields such as mathematics, economics, logic, and computer science. In the context of computer science, two-player games are particularly popular for modeling interactions between an agent (such as a program) and its environment (e.g., the user or the operating system). For example, researchers in game semantics often utilize two-player games to model such interactions.

The concept of simple parallel composition involves combining event structures with polarity. By juxtaposing disjoint copies of the event structures and maintaining their causal dependency, the operation specifies a finite subset of events as consistent if it restricts to consistent subsets of the original event structures, while leaving the polarities unchanged.

In the following section, we establish the value theorem on concurrent games. The proof involves two main steps. First, we present important constructions on strategies and study the results of their interactions. This analysis enables us to characterize the values of all positions in the game. By leveraging the well-foundedness of the game, we are able to deduce the sought-after value theorem.
