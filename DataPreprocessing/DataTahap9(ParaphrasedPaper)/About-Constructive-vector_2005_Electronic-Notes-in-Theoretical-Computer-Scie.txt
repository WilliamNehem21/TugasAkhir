For instance, an element from the set a4 can be represented as a tuple (x1, x2, x3, x4) containing four elements from set a. In the realm of computer science, this method can be advantageous; for instance, a byte is typically implemented as a tuple (b7, b6, b5, b4, b3, b2, b1, b0) of bits. However, in general, the major downside of this approach is its lack of generality.

The content is easily comprehensible. Initially, the variables a, f, n, and v are introduced in the environment, followed by a request for an induction on the variable v. The subsequent line solves the base case by presenting the unique element from a 0. The third line tackles the induction step, constructing the image of a vector vcons a n e v by utilizing the image of e through the mapping function f, as well as the value ihv derived from induction. To achieve this, it applies the vcons a n constructor to f e.
