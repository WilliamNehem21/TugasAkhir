The issue of inter-cell interference (ICI) is expected to be a primary challenge in future wireless networks, particularly at the cell edge, and will become more pronounced in dense deployments of micro and macro cells. To address this, the coordinated multi-point (CoMP) technique has been introduced to alleviate ICI and enhance network performance at the cell edge. While the CoMP technique has shown promise in addressing various issues at the cell edge, existing CoMP handover schemes fail to prevent unnecessary handover initiation decisions. This paper proposes a new CoMP-based handover scheme that aims to minimize unnecessary handover decisions at the cell edge by incorporating signal measurements such as reference signal received power (RSRP) and received signal received quality (RSRQ). By utilizing a combination of RSRP and RSRQ calculations, the proposed scheme facilitates a reliable decision-making process for CoMP mode and handover mode at the cell edge. Numerical experiments demonstrate that triggering the CoMP mode leads to a consistent improvement in overall network performance by progressively reducing the number of unnecessary handovers. 

Coordinated multipoint (CoMP) is an advanced technology of Long Term Evolution-Advanced (LTE-A) that offers solutions for inter-cell and intra-cell interference, thereby enhancing cell edge performance. In the context of current research, the CoMP technique plays a crucial role in reducing unnecessary handover decisions at the cell edge and improving network performance. User mobility significantly impacts wireless networks, particularly in scenarios involving fast-moving users or congested environments such as shopping malls and stadiums. To address mobility challenges, cellular technologies have introduced handover mechanisms aimed at providing seamless user experience. Handover becomes especially critical and challenging for cell edge users, where the received signal from the serving enhanced NodeB (eNB) is typically poor due to factors such as distance and high interference from neighboring cells. Handover hysteresis and handover margin (HOM) values are key considerations in minimizing unnecessary handovers in wireless networks, and are widely employed in LTE-A handover algorithms and proposed schemes. An adaptive hysteresis value based on actual hysteresis value is presented as part of a grouping algorithm to control unnecessary handovers in a heterogeneous network with dense small cell deployment. The algorithm involves predefined thresholds and aims to prevent unnecessary handovers by considering actual UE distance and angle of movement from the base station. While the authors have presented valuable research, they have overlooked critical issues such as load on the serving eNB and interference levels at the cell edge in their results, which are significant considerations for future networks during handover decisions.

Another handover scheme for microcells is presented, which utilizes hysteresis margin value to mitigate redundant handovers. The position of the UE is calculated to set the hysteresis margin value, and channel quality indicators are employed to define decision parameters. The proposed handover scheme aims to reduce unnecessary handovers and improve user performance at the cell edge by operating in two modes: CoMP mode and handover mode. In CoMP mode, the UE receives RSRP from the serving eNB below a predetermined threshold, while the RSRQ level is not significantly degraded. In contrast, when the UE receives RSRP below the threshold level and the RSRQ level is also poor, the handover mode is triggered, and the handover process is initiated. This approach aims to optimize the triggering of CoMP and handover modes to address the dynamics at the cell edge and improve handover decisions for enhanced network performance. The decrease in RSRP at the cell edge is attributed to factors such as large fading, which affect received power due to multipath, speed of surrounding objects, and transmission bandwidth.
