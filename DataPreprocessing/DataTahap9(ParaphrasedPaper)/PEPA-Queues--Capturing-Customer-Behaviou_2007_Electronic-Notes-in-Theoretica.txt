The formalisms used in queueing networks excel at capturing the spatial movement of customers, but they are often limited in their ability to depict the changes that occur in individual customers as they traverse the network. In this paper, we present the formalism of PEPA queues, which employs the stochastic process algebra PEPA to model the individual states and behaviors of customers and servers within the network. We provide a formal semantics for PEPA queues and offer a direct translation to PEPA to leverage existing tools for analyzing PEPA models. Furthermore, we utilize the IPC/DNAMACA tool-chain to conduct passage-time analysis on a dual web server example.

While queueing networks are adept at representing the overall structure of a system, they typically struggle to describe the evolution of individual customers within the network. Customers are often treated as undifferentiated entities with no internal behaviors, or are segregated into a small set of static classes when necessary.

The component P+Q represents a system that can behave as either P or Q, with the first activity to complete determining the behavior of the system. The state of a PEPA component, known as a token, can change independently or in cooperation with neighboring components as the system evolves. PEPA nets serve as a higher-level formalism, possessing their own explicit semantics and the ability to be compiled into PEPA for analysis with existing tools.

In the case of PEPA queues, the state of a queue is determined by the current state of each component waiting in the queue and the state of the local component, rather than being represented by a vector of buffer occupancies as with typical, opaque customers. PEPA queues allow for a succinct expression of various queueing mechanisms, such as modeling breakdown and repair in a network of PEPA queues.

We also discuss the implications of allowing cooperation at the network level, emphasizing the separation of local behavior from spatial migration within the queueing network. Additionally, the mechanics of moving customers between queues and the considerations for inter-customer cooperation are described in detail.

Overall, our work introduces the formalism of PEPA queues, which provides a means to express individual customer behavior and routing within queueing networks, bridging the gap between behavioral descriptions and spatial formalism in situations where queueing models are more suitable. The potential for inter-customer cooperation in real-world systems is also addressed, demonstrating its relevance in representing negative customers and other dynamics within the queueing network.
