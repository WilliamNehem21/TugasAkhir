Metamodelling has garnered significant interest within the model-driven development (MDD) research community. For a metamodel to be reusable in different MDD approaches, it should be designed such that it is unaware of any extensions made by another metamodel, a property referred to as obliviousness. However, this study demonstrates that existing techniques for implementing metamodels do not maintain obliviousness when certain elements of the extended metamodel and the elements of the original model are associated. The paper explores three different approaches to metamodel reuse, including traditional object-oriented techniques as well as aspect-oriented techniques. It also presents evidence that the third approach, which treats relationships as first-class citizens at the implementation level using relationship aspects, ensures the obliviousness of metamodels.

The paper begins by introducing metamodelling concepts in Section 2 and the Eclipse Modelling Framework (EMF) in Section 3. It then delves into the challenges that arise when metamodels are extended in Section 4, and analyzes three different approaches to the extension of metamodels in Section 5. The conclusion drawn from the analysis is presented in Section 6.

The study highlights the use of the Object Management Group's (OMG) Metadata Object Facility (MOF) framework and the MOF specification as key components of metamodelling frameworks, and discusses how the MOF standardization has enabled the definition of mappings for representing and managing metadata across different technologies. In addition, the paper outlines the Ecore metamodel included in the EMF, discussing its differences from MOF and its functionality.

The paper also provides insight into the use of Java interfaces to define the core model, and discusses the annotated Java approach for defining the Ecore model. It underscores the importance of maintaining the obliviousness of metamodels in order to improve metamodel reuse, and examines the implications of the different approaches for maintaining obliviousness.

Furthermore, the study identifies the need to adapt and extend the relationship aspect library (RAL) to accommodate various types of relationships within the metamodelling framework, and discusses plans to integrate these new aspect-oriented features into current modelling and metamodelling frameworks as part of future work.
