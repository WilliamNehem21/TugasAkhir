One challenge in the field of molecular biology is deciphering the functional implications of the vast amount of existing knowledge. To address this challenge, specific tools have been developed to accurately represent biological processes, and process algebras have been shown to be effective in formalizing interactions, capturing the extensive parallelism and concurrency of biological interactions, and analyzing overall behavior.

The rules (com) and (dec) define the capabilities for protein complexation and decomplexation, respectively, by incorporating this information into transition labels and updating the proteins. Similarly, the rules (sol) and (mem) extend transitions to groups and membranes, with a crucial consideration that the created or deleted edge names do not conflict with existing names. The rule (nucleus) extends internal transitions of nuclei to the entire cell, with the same precaution regarding the created or deleted edge names. Additionally, the (nucleus) rule prohibits complexation or decomplexation between nuclei and the external solution. The rules (react) and (ms-react) describe reactions, including complexations and decomplexations, in groups and cells. In particular, the (react) rule accounts for reactions between membranes of different cells, with a constraint that different proteins must be involved in the reactions. This constraint simplifies the process, as it requires additional information to differentiate between proteins with the same name.

The signaling stimulus originates from the epidermal growth factor (EGF), specifically its dimeric form, which can bind to the associated receptor EGFR on the cell membrane. This binding activates EGFR by phosphorylating an internal domain of the protein, leading to a series of interactions with cytoplasmic protein complexes, ultimately resulting in the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). The phosphorylated ERK can then translocate into the cell nucleus and modulate gene expression, stimulating cell division and proliferation.

Another issue arises at the end of the RTK-MAPK pathway, where a protein (ERK) is phosphorylated and enters the nucleus. Currently, there is no mechanism to facilitate the entry of entities into the cell, which will be discussed in detail in section 4.

The rule (open) prepares a cell for fusion with another cell, and the rule (grasp) extends the fusion capability to groups by immobilizing them as a mreagent. The rules (fuse) and (fuse-i) specify fusions between peer and nested cells, respectively, with the formation of the new cell membrane indicated by the function f. The rule (mem-a) is a refinement of (mem) and models potential alterations to membrane names due to interactions between membrane proteins and external proteins. Likewise, the rule (ms-areact) refines (ms-react) to account for these interactions.

The final section of the infection pathway is described assuming that the virus has been engulfed by the host cell, with the first steps skipped due to the inability to express the phagocytosis of the virus. This missing part will be analyzed in section 4.

The membrane transition becomes "mx" in the cellular transition, representing the exposure of phagocytosis in the label. Similarly, the rule (open-c) involves the removal of material from the host cell membrane needed for the new membrane surrounding the phagocytosed cell, while the material is restored in the rule (phago).
