The importance of fault diagnosis in power systems, particularly in the context of the increasing size and complexity of control systems, cannot be overstated. Within high voltage direct current (HVDC) systems, various faults such as AC faults, internal converter faults, and DC faults can occur due to insulation failures caused by short circuits, switching operations, and lightning strikes [6,7]. The impact of atmospheric lightning on these systems, through the generation of overvoltages from direct lightning strikes or back flashover voltages, necessitates the implementation of precautions to mitigate the effects on both AC and DC parts of an HVDC system [8,9].

This paper seeks to contribute to the development of an analytical approach to identify critical points within a voltage-source converter-based HVDC system where surge arresters can be strategically placed to counter lightning impulse currents resulting from atmospheric effects. Rather than indiscriminately situating surge arresters at every connection point, the study aims to determine the most critical points in a practical VSC-HVDC system based on simulation results, subsequently optimizing the deployment of surge arresters at these locations. The paper presents simulation studies on a prototype model and the resultant findings used to determine the optimal number and placement of surge arresters, along with a systematic explanation of the preferred characteristics of protection devices. By evaluating numerous scenarios, the study culminates in the development of an optimal protection scheme that offers significant economic advantages in terms of protective device expenditures. Furthermore, the paper presents the results of lightning impulse tests conducted on the VSC-HVDC prototype to validate the insulation after the simulation and protection device optimization studies.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of the prototype VSC-based HVDC system and details the modeling studies, while the arrester selection procedure is delineated in Section 3. Section 4 presents the simulation results, followed by the presentation of lightning impulse test results in Section 5. This is followed by a discussion in Section 6 and conclusions in Section 7.

The paper also discusses the ground flash density (NG) as a critical parameter, which represents the number of lightning strikes per square kilometer per year and is a key descriptor in lightning protection studies. Additionally, the classification of surge arresters for HVDC systems is explored, with heavy distribution class arresters being the preferred option for a real system with a voltage level of 36 kV and an amplitude of at least 10 kA for the selected lightning impulse current.

The selection of surge arresters with a better protection rate, considering factors such as protection ratio, rated discharge current, and energy transfer capacity, is also emphasized. Furthermore, the recommendation to use a protection factor (KS) between the insulation working voltage (LIWV) and the maximum value of the lightning surge, with KS set to 1.15 for outdoor insulation, is discussed.

Finally, the paper details the mechanism for reducing the thermal charge value generated by a lightning strike below 1.1 coulomb to ensure the effectiveness of surge arresters during lightning events, in consideration of the lightning impulse protective level (LIPLM) determined by insulation co-ordination and relevant factors such as the test safety factor (K8) and the atmospheric correction factor (KT).
