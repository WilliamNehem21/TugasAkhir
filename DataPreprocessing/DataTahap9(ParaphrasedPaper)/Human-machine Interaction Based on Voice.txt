The human-machine system plays a critical role in various domains involving the interaction between humans and machines. Voice-based identification, as a prominent method of user-device communication, has been widely adopted across different applications due to advancements in hardware technologies and mathematical algorithms. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the theoretical foundations and algorithms utilized in such systems, as well as presents the experimental results.

Speech recognition, which utilizes voice signals as input instead of traditional input methods like keyboards and touch screens, offers enhanced convenience and speed, thereby enabling machines to better accommodate human users. With continuous advancements in hardware technologies and mathematical algorithms, the field of speech recognition has become increasingly sophisticated.

Voice activity detection represents a crucial preprocessing step in signal processing, as accurate identification of the signal endpoints is essential for subsequent processing. In this study, the dual threshold method is employed for voice activity detection, involving the analysis of short-term energy and short-term zero rate algorithm. This method is implemented in four stages: mute, transition, voice, and end, with the transition between these stages being determined based on the comparison of energy and zero rate parameters against predefined threshold values.

The utilization of hidden Markov models (HMM) is proposed for non-specific recognition systems, providing a probabilistic model for the statistical properties of a random process modeled by a Markov chain. The complete parameter set of an HMM includes the state number, the number of observation symbols, and the probability distribution matrices for state transitions and observation symbols. Typical formulas are presented in this article to represent a specific HMM model.
