This paper examines the matching problem for bigraphs and focuses on presenting an inductive characterization of matching of binding bigraphs. The aim is to lay the groundwork for a matching algorithm that is provably correct, as required for an implementation of bigraphical reactive systems.

The implementation of the dynamics of bigraphical reactive systems is important for experimentation and simulation, as highlighted in previous research. The paper's primary objective is to address the core problem of implementing the dynamics of bigraphical reactive systems, which is the matching problem. This involves determining whether and how a given bigraph can be rewritten using a given reaction rule. The paper proposes an analysis of the matching problem, building on normal form theorems for bigraphs and discrete decompositions of bigraphs.

The inductive characterization is based on normal form theorems for bigraphs, which express how general bigraphs can be broken down into simpler graphs. Additionally, the paper analyzes the embedding problem for a restricted class of graphs and explores the use of discrete decompositions and algebraic presentation for such graphs. The hope is that matching implementations will be efficient in practice, given that the redices involved are typically small, and sorting bigraphs could assist in early search elimination.

The paper is organized into several sections, starting with an informal description of binding bigraphs in section 2. The main contribution is presented in section 3, where the inductive characterization of matching is discussed. Section 4 explores how the inductive characterization can ensure a correct and efficient matching algorithm. The paper concludes with discussions of related work and a summary.

The paper also discusses the operational bottom-up approach for decomposing agents using inference trees and rules, as well as the introduction of matching rules for structural and inductive purposes. It argues that a rigorous approach to matching is crucial, as it will be fundamental to any implementation of bigraph dynamics.

The paper draws connections between bigraphical reactive systems and graph transformation systems, noting that general graph pattern matching algorithms may be applicable but may not exploit the specific structure of bigraphs. Efficient implementations of bigraph matching are suggested to derive from initial implementations by experimenting with different normal inference tree definitions and combining them with subtree isomorphism algorithms. The inductive characterization provided in the paper is expected to facilitate the proof of the actual algorithm's correctness.

In summary, the paper contributes to the understanding of the matching problem for bigraphs, with implications for the implementation of bigraphical reactive systems.
