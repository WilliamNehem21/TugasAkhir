Lemma 2.1 [3, Lemma 2.3] states that if a graph g is given and another graph h is obtained from g by adding a pendant vertex to any vertex of g, then the determinant of the Laplacian matrix of h, denoted as det(d(h)), remains unchanged irrespective of which vertex of g is connected to the pendant vertex by an edge.

Moreover, if g is divided into two disjoint sets of vertices, denoted as {v1, v2,..., vk} and {vk+1, vk+2,..., vn}, and if g1 and g2 are obtained from g by adding an edge between vertices v1 and vn, then h can be obtained from g1 and g2 by first identifying vertices v1 and vn, and then adding a pendent vertex from either v1 or vn. In such a case, it is also observed that det(d(g)) = det(d(h)).
