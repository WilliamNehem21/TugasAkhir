Widening operators have a number of undesirable characteristics, with the primary one being the introduction of imprecision. The outcome of widening/narrowing iterations can result in a set that is significantly larger than the smallest element of the abstract domain, which serves as an inductive invariant, and even invariant itself (in Section 5, we will present some alternative approaches that do not suffer from this drawback, although at the expense of generality). The main contribution of this paper is a generic technique designed to alleviate some of the imprecision caused by widening.

Program 1 serves as an abstraction of program 2, where each execution of the latter is mapped to an execution of the former. However, the analysis of program 1 yields a more precise loop invariant compared to the analysis of program 2. This illustrates the nonmonotonic nature of analyses using widenings, a well-established phenomenon (see e.g., [7, ex. 11]): a more accurate abstraction can ultimately lead to reduced precision in the final analysis output.

The standard widening on polyhedra p1osp2 effectively eliminates constraints from p2 that are not present in p1. However, the correct definition incorporates intricacies related to polyhedra of dimension lower than the space dimension, and the original definition required correction. The revised definition is provided.

It is already known that widenings followed by reductions with cycles (reduce a using b, then reduce b using a) may not ensure termination. For example, closure in difference-bound matrices and octagons breaks termination ([15, example 3.7.3, p. 85]).

"Lao Kernels" is a collection of benchmarks used internally for evaluating compiler code generators and optimizations. It primarily consists of small computational kernels representative of the target applications of STMicroelectronics (audio and video stream processing, embedded device control), along with a testing harness for running them on the target processor. The benchmark includes 63 functions, 49 of which contain at least one loop. The loops must exhibit specific properties, such as a non-linear relation between variables in the loop scope, in order to benefit from this method. Stratified analysis yields a more precise invariant for 5 of these functions.
