The rewriting calculus has been suggested as a language for specifying strategies for rewriting terms. In this framework, rules are explicitly represented as terms and are directly applied to other terms to transform them. Sets of rules may be non-deterministically applied to (sets of) terms to produce sets of results. Strategies are implemented as rules that accept other rules as arguments and apply them in specific ways. This paper outlines ongoing work to enhance the rewriting calculus by giving it a logical semantics, which can offer important guidance for studying the language and enhancing its expressive power. The extension to support higher-order rewriting, where rules can rewrite other rules, is used to demonstrate the increased expressive capability. The logical semantics used is based on ordered linear logic, and the paper illustrates these concepts through various examples.

The language is higher-order in that rules and sets of rules can be passed as arguments to other rules, allowing for the creation of parameterized strategies. The paper also explores a more general notion of rewriting by removing restrictions on the usage of rules. By doing so, the scope of rewriting is broadened, and the paper aims to generalize the semantics to facilitate the definition of higher-form rewriting.

The paper further discusses the development of the linear logical semantics to support a broader form of rewriting beyond traditional first-order rewriting, known as higher-form rewriting, where rules can rewrite other rules. This approach has the potential to enable the creation of rewriting meta-programs like completion or termination analysis within the same language as the rewriting system itself, without the need for reflection.

The authors have explored a logical semantics for both traditional rewriting and higher-form rewriting, based on ordered linear logic with some higher-order extensions. Terms are interpreted as formulas and rewriting as ordered linear entailment. The majority of operational rules of the rewriting calculus as defined by Cirstea and Kirchner are found to be sound with respect to the proposed semantics.
