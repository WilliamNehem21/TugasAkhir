The National Tractor Testing Laboratory (NTTL) has led the way in testing tractors and providing a reliable source of data. This data includes information on fuel consumption, wheel slip, engine speed, forward speed, drawbar pull, drawbar power, and hydraulic oil temperature of the tested tractors. The measurement and monitoring of hydraulic oil temperature were used to ensure that the tractor was operating under steady state conditions, and to validate the data collection process.

Since 1986, the NTTL has evaluated tractor performance using the official testing procedures outlined in the OECD standard. The current OECD standard code 2 is dedicated to the official testing of agricultural and forestry tractors under controlled steady state conditions (OECD, 2020). According to this standard, tests must be conducted on a concrete flat surface to eliminate the effects of soil characteristics on tractor performance. During the tests, the tractor was loaded by a load car, specifically a Caterpillar articulated dump truck, which applied controlled loads to the tractor. This load car was equipped with two load cell transducers.

Intelligent fuzzy systems were developed to estimate the drawbar pull provided by the MFWD tractor based on three independent input variables: slip of driving wheels, tractor weight, and tractor driving mode. This intelligent fuzzy system consists of five layers, each containing various nodes. These five layers are known as fuzzification, normalization, fuzzy rule, defuzzification, and output layers, respectively. The estimation process involves passing data sets through these five layers.

To validate the results, each test involved driving the tractor along a straight path of approximately 61 meters. If similar results were achieved in two tests, the next load set point was applied. If the results were not similar, more data were collected until two tests showed similar results. The details of the test track on a concrete flat surface were fully explained by Howard et al. (2013). The test data sets (288 sets) considered in this study for all eleven MFWD models of New Holland tractors were collected at the NTTL from 2000 to 2004.

Research has shown that the net traction force and drawbar pull of the tractor increase as the traction force generated by the driving wheels increases, which is influenced by the slip of the driving wheels and the tractor weight. It is important to note that the slip of the driving wheels has an indirect relationship with inflation pressure, dynamic load, and tire type (bias and radial ply). The study found that radial ply tires, which were used in the New Holland tractors, develop higher gross traction force than bias ply tires. Additionally, radial ply tires have lower slip and rolling resistance force compared to bias ply tires in similar tire and soil conditions. These characteristics are attributed to the footprint of radial ply tires on the soil, which is narrower and longer, resulting in uniform ground contact pressure, lower slip, higher gross traction force, and decreased rolling resistance force.

The developed intelligent fuzzy system calculator was trained using drawbar pull data sets from tractors tested at the NTTL. It should be noted that the calculator's training was based on tests conducted on a concrete flat surface. Thus, the calculator is suitable for use in construction and industrial environments with similar surface conditions, but may not be applicable for various soil conditions and types of MFWD tractors. To address this limitation, it is necessary to retrain the intelligent system of the calculator with more specific data sets from different models of MFWD tractors and soil conditions in future research works. Another limitation of the calculator is its user interface, which is dependent on the MATLAB software's fuzzy workspace. This restricts its widespread use, calling for efforts to develop a spreadsheet graphical user interface for broader application. Previous researchers have suggested similar enhancements to improve the usability of similar calculators.
