The paper is structured as follows. Section II provides an explanation of cryogenic device characterization and the developed 4 K CMOS model for circuit design. Section III discusses the clock generator architecture and considerations for cryogenic circuit design. The measurement results of the clock generator at 300 K and 4 K are detailed in Section IV, and finally, the article concludes in Section V.

Furthermore, the inclusion of quantum transport, source-to-drain tunneling, and other factors such as Monte Carlo parameters, parasitic capacitors, self-heating effects, mismatch parameters, and small-signal modeling of cryo-MOSFETs have not been considered and require additional study and modeling. These aspects will be addressed in the subsequent stage of our cryo-CMOS modeling research.
