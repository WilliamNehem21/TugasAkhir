In recent decades, numerous techniques for background modeling have been developed to identify foreground objects in video footage. These methods typically employ a common approach, wherein they use the initial frame or previous frames to construct a background model, compare the current frame with the background model to detect foreground objects, and then update the background model. These methods can be categorized into pixel-based, region-based, and hybrid methods, as well as parametric and nonparametric methods. For instance, the Gaussian model is a well-known pixel-based parametric method, and various evaluations have been conducted to compare the performance of different background modeling methods and discuss the challenges they face.

The ability to adapt to sudden changes in illumination is crucial for evaluating background modeling methods, as unexpected changes in lighting can significantly impact the appearance of the background model. Some methods address this issue by using alternative color spaces such as HSV or normalized color space to minimize the effects of brightness changes, as opposed to the RGB color space which is sensitive to illumination changes. Additionally, certain methods combine long-term and short-term background models to quickly adapt to scene changes and achieve sensitive detection with low false positive rates.

Dynamic background scenarios are addressed by methods such as GMM and SOBS which assume that the intensity values of a pixel are modeled by multimodal distributions. On the other hand, sample-based methods like ViBe and SACON utilize selective strategies to update the background model efficiently in response to lighting changes and the appearance or disappearance of objects in the background. Region-based methods, such as those based on texture or descriptors, use reliable information to represent dynamic backgrounds and illumination changes. Shadow detection is also an important aspect, with different methods using distinct approaches to identify and suppress shadows in the background model.

Methods like ViBe and SACON are designed to reduce the effects of noise in the background model by comparing the current pixel with only a small number of close background samples, rather than most of the samples in the model. They achieve high resilience to noise through specific design features and update schemes. The traditional GMM approach and the Codebook algorithm also have their respective advantages and limitations in handling background modeling, with GMM being able to deal with multimodal backgrounds and gradual illumination changes, while Codebook can capture background motion over a long period of time.

The performance evaluation of the background modeling methods involves pixel-level assessment through binary classification of each pixel as foreground or background. Various metrics such as recall, specificity, false positive rate, false negative rate, percentage of wrong classification, precision, and F-measure are used to gauge the correctness of this classification.

The paper reports an evaluation of eight state-of-the-art background modeling methods, with detailed performance analysis based on various metrics. Practical implementations of the methods were utilized, and the computational resources required by each method were also assessed. The results highlighted the need for background models to respond quickly to camera rotations or zooms in order to improve detection performance.
