Currently, there is a notable increase in the number of coronavirus patients, and the relationship between the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) and the internet is struggling to keep pace with this surge in patients. The transmission of patient health records (PHR) to healthcare providers through the internet plays a vital role in remote monitoring and the rapid detection of newly infected coronavirus patients. However, this has also raised significant security and privacy concerns within the global healthcare system due to the potential tampering of control messages. This paper focuses on addressing these challenges by proposing the application of blockchain and smart contract mechanisms to enhance the security of health applications. Specifically, the paper introduces a new security framework based on context-aware CP-ABE, incorporating context-aware policies to achieve robust identity authentication and confidentiality for individuals.

Furthermore, the storage and transmission of healthcare data through the cloud have become increasingly crucial, but this has also led to security challenges such as confidentiality and privacy of patient data. The integration of the IoMT in the collection and transmission of medical data to the cloud for analysis by healthcare experts has further compounded these challenges. This paper also discusses how blockchain technology can address these issues by ensuring the integrity of data in distributed e-health systems.

In recent years, blockchain technology has made significant advancements, revolutionizing various sectors including finance, healthcare, and supply chain. Its key advantages of decentralization, persistence, anonymity, and auditability have the potential to greatly reduce costs and improve efficiency in healthcare. The paper proposes the application of blockchain technology and cryptography techniques to enhance the security and privacy of healthcare data, eliminating the need for third-party control and enabling secure access for hospitals and clinics.

The paper is structured as follows: it provides a detailed overview of related work, presents an ontology model, introduces the proposed security framework, discusses the implementation details and experimental results, and concludes with future perspectives.

Additionally, the paper discusses a novel authentication technique for secure communication in the mobile cloud, emphasizing the mutual verification between users and cloud providers to protect access control. It also explores the security challenges of implementing blockchain in sustainable smart cities and the use of neural networks for secure access control in digital healthcare systems.

Moreover, attribute-based encryption (ABE) is highlighted as a promising approach for flexible and large-scale encryption based on attributes, contributing to efficient access control while adapting to environmental changes. The paper also mentions the importance of cryptography in ensuring secure communication and the need for robust, low-cost encryption-decryption schemes for the IoMT.

Furthermore, the paper introduces a scenario where a patient can delegate access rights to another medical specialist, highlighting the need for dynamic updating of access policies and the utilization of context-aware CP-ABE for secure delegation of access.

The paper also describes the use of the AVISPA verification tool for analyzing the security of the proposed schema, demonstrating its security through classifiers based on stability and total execution time.

In summary, the paper aims to address the security and privacy concerns in healthcare data management by proposing innovative solutions based on blockchain, smart contract mechanisms, and context-aware access control.
