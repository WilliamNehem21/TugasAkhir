This study aimed to develop and evaluate a visual machine technology-based intelligent system for distinguishing between alive and dead rainbow trout fish eggs. The system utilized image processing to extract features from the eggs, which were then used as decision-making variables in a classifier. The classifiers employed in this study were the multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLP) and support vector machine (SVM). A paired t-test was used to select 10 effective features from the initial 15 features for classification. The k-fold cross validation method was employed to evaluate the classifiers. Varying the size of the training data set from 80% to 20% allowed for an assessment of the classifiers' ability and stability. The results demonstrated that during the training phase, the mean values of the statistical indices for both MLP and SVM classifications were perfect, with 100% correct predictions for all categories. Similarly, in the test phase, the performance indicators of both classifiers were highly satisfactory, with an average accuracy of 99.45%. As a result, both classifiers can be confidently utilized for the separation of rainbow trout fish eggs.

The findings of this research have potential implications for food engineers seeking to develop an accurate device for addressing this issue.

Furthermore, the study explored various image features such as energy, contrast, homogeneity, and correlation, and their significance in distinguishing between alive and dead fish eggs. The performance of the classifiers was also evaluated using different algorithms and transformations. Notably, the MLP neural network was trained using three selected features and achieved a mean precision of 99.45% in distinguishing between alive and dead fish eggs across various datasets.
