The paper contains segments covering the definition and measurement of the two-dimensional complex argument error function (CAEF) of the terminal voltage phasor, as well as the calculation of the differential CAEF using Wirtinger calculus. It also discusses the normal CAEF (NCAEF) for steady state of the plant. Section III presents the use of CAEF at terminal voltage phasor for excitation control of the synchronous machine. In Section IV, an example is provided to study small-signal stability with the proposed excitation control. The paper concludes by summarizing its findings.
