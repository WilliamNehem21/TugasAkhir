In today's world, there is a growing reliance on robots to fulfill various human needs, which has led to an increasing demand for the development of intelligent robots. The field of robot learning, which combines robotics and machine learning, is essential for enabling robots to transition from their current state to a new state in order to perform new actions (i.e., policies). Machine learning techniques are traditionally employed to develop new policies.

One commonly used approach in learning from demonstration involves a robot learning how to perform a task using its own sensors, rather than interpreting the body of a demonstrator or another robot. The demonstrator guides the robot through multiple demonstrations in an iterative manner, enabling the robot to generalize the demonstrated task. If errors occur during task performance, additional demonstrations are provided by the demonstrator. The objective is to enhance the robot's adaptability to new conditions.

Calinon and Billard introduced an approach for gesture recognition and reproduction, which involves two main stages: employing principal component analysis (PCA) or independent component analysis (ICA) for data decomposition as a preprocessing stage, followed by the application of hidden Markov models (HMMs) for gesture encoding. Another approach for dimensionality reduction is the use of factor analyzers. The authors also proposed an approach for trajectory learning from demonstration, utilizing probabilistic motion primitives to represent demonstrated trajectories. This method involves recording human body motions and establishing a correspondence map between humans and robots, and it can be applied to various applications such as surgical procedures. Another approach for learning from demonstration, known as kinesthetic teaching, involves teaching robot motions without interpreting human body movements.

It has been observed from the literature that learning from demonstration primarily relies on discrete data, which can introduce distortions in the learning process. Therefore, a preprocessing phase is necessary to address such distortions. In this paper, a new approach for robot trajectory learning is developed, employing the posterior HMM state distribution as a preprocessing step. This distribution is used to reconstruct trajectory data using a set of hidden states, which is then utilized to identify the initial key points. Subsequently, HMM is employed to model the set of key points, and dynamic time warping (DTW) is used for temporal alignment. Weights are assigned to the key points based on their variance, and cubic spline interpolation is used to generalize the trajectory.

The paper also discusses the use of state transition matrices to denote the probability of transition from one state to another, and the employment of discrete HMMs for modeling demonstrated trajectories. The parameters for the HMM are initialized using a minimum distortion trajectory and a left-right topology.

Furthermore, the paper describes the application of posterior HMM state distribution for interpolating missing fields and for clustering the normalized positions and velocities of raw data. This clustering aids in identifying initial key points and reconstructing data to avoid local distortions, resulting in more accurate identification of the initial key points and a more precise generalized trajectory.

The proposed scheme for robot trajectory learning from demonstration involves a preprocessing stage to mitigate potential distortions associated with using raw discrete data. The preprocessed data effectively identifies the most significant points in each demonstration, making it more suitable for identifying initial key points than raw data. The preprocessed data is utilized instead of the raw data, leading to the identification and encoding of key points using HMM, temporal alignment of key points, and cubic spline interpolation. The root mean square error (RMSE) is used to compare the generalized trajectory obtained with this approach to those of previous methods, and the results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method in minimizing errors, while also showing comparable computational costs to state-of-the-art approaches. Ongoing work is focused on enhancing the proposed scheme by exploring alternative clustering techniques for identifying key points.
