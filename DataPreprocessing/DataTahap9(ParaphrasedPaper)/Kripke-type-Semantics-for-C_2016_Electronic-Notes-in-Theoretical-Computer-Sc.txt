One approach to semantics, known as many-valued semantics, aims to preserve the concept of homomorphisms between the language structure and a truth function algebra while allowing for more than two truth values in the algebra domain. On the other hand, Kripke-type semantics maintains only two truth values, but introduces a relation between valuations. Although these semantics may raise philosophical concerns, they are valuable technical tools that can provide mathematical support for fundamental philosophical principles. 

There are various methods for defining the semantics of a logic, particularly for non-classical logics. For the purposes of this discussion, we will focus on two types: multivalued semantics and Kripke-type semantics. Let us explore some general concepts related to these semantics.
