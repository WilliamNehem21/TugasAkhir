Salicylic acid (SA), a natural plant growth regulator with phenolic properties, serves various important functions in the regulation of plant growth and development, as well as in enhancing plant resilience to both biotic and abiotic stresses. It is also crucial in influencing the quality of berries, impacting attributes such as color, flavor, astringency, bitterness, size, weight, and firmness, while reducing fruit respiration, ethylene biosynthesis, weight loss, decay, and softening during storage and shelf-life.

This investigation was conducted over the course of two seasons, 2014 and 2015, to examine the effects of foliar application of salicylic acid (SA) on the physical and chemical quality attributes of berries from superior seedless grape clusters. Sample clusters with an average berry juice soluble solid content (SSC%) of 17% were divided into two main groups: the first group comprised 120 clusters, with 24 clusters per treatment, for measuring physical and chemical quality attributes over a four-day shelf-life period; the second group contained 100 clusters for non-destructive measurements such as rachis browning index, water loss, and berry shattering. The samples were handled by the Pomology Department of the Faculty of Agriculture at Mansoura University and stored there.

Various quality attributes were assessed: SSC% was measured using a Carl Zeiss hand refractometer, acidity as tartaric acid (TA) was determined by titration with 0.1N NaOH, the SSC/TA ratio was calculated as the defined maturity index, berry firmness and separation force were recorded using a fruit texture penetrometer, and color was analyzed using ImageJ software. Additionally, rachis membrane electrolyte leakage, total phenols, and total carotenoids content were measured.

The data were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with shelf-life time and treatment factors being considered, and the means were compared using the least significant differences (LSD) at a 0.05 level of probability. The statistical software package GenStat version 11 was utilized for the analysis.

The quality of rachis in grape clusters has been extensively studied due to its impact on cluster freshness and consumer preference. The application of SA at 4 mm resulted in a significant reduction in rachis browning during the four-day shelf-life compared to other concentrations. The color changes in the clusters were related to aging cluster tissue and water loss during shelf-life. SA treatment at 4 mm also presented lower membrane electrolyte leakage, suggesting reduced membrane damage and delayed respiration and ethylene production.

In conclusion, SA treatment at 4 mm demonstrated potential benefits against rachis browning and water loss in detached grape clusters, and it may offer a safe and effective means of delaying or shifting the ripening process of grapes while improving fruit quality during shelf-life.
