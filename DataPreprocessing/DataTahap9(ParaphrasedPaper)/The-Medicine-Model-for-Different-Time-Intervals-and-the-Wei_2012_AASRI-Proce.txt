The paper presents a medication method that considers variations in body weight and differing time intervals for drug administration. It acknowledges the impact of individual patient weight, varying time intervals for medication, and differences in metabolism and absorption rates between day and night. The study establishes two mathematical models for daytime and nighttime drug concentrations, finding that higher doses are needed in the morning compared to noon and evening, and that dosages should be adjusted according to patient weight. The paper concludes that these models can inform pharmaceutical manufacturing to produce conveniently dosed pills and guide doctors in prescribing appropriate doses for patients in order to speed up recovery without causing harm.

The paper is structured as follows: section 2 outlines the modeling mechanism for drug concentration based on the rate of change and medication amount; section 3 establishes mathematical models for daytime and nighttime drug concentration under reasonable assumptions; section 4 presents the analysis and verification of the models, concluding that morning doses should be relatively large and that dosages should increase with patient weight. The paper then suggests that these findings can inform pharmaceutical manufacturing and dosage prescriptions for patients, ensuring speedy recovery without harm.

A specific example is provided in which the medication cycle is 1 day, with medication taken three times a day at intervals of 6 hours, 6 hours, and 12 hours. The initial dosage for a 600g fish is determined, and the paper notes that this method can be adapted for other fish and terrestrial animals, with appropriate adjustments in initial dosage based on animal development.
