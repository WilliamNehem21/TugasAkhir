This paper has two main objectives. Firstly, we aim to further investigate certain variations of the traditional Hausdorff difference hierarchy (DH). Secondly, we provide a detailed analysis of a specific category of computable topological spaces outlined in previous studies [12, 24], which is pertinent to our examination of the DH and computability in topology.

In this section, we briefly explore concepts associated with countably-based T0-spaces and their computability. Many of the ideas and findings presented here are not groundbreaking and are instead adaptations or extensions of those found in existing literature (also refer to exercise 3.2.17).
