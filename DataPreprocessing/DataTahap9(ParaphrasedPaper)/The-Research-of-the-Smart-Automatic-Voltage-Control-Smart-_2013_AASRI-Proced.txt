The current state of the smart grid can be categorized into three main areas: a fragile area, fault disturbance area, and repair and maintenance area when the grid is not running normally. Once the workspace is assessed, control can be established over these non-normal zones, ultimately ensuring optimal grid operation and resource allocation. In this way, the power grid operation can be divided into five areas: optimized operation zone, routine operation zone, abnormal and vulnerable zone, contingency and fault zone, and repair maintenance zone.

Moreover, the smart grid enables increased interactivity and facilitates access to a wide array of distributed power generation units, energy storage systems, renewable energy sources, and seamless integration with the distribution network. Furthermore, it supports micro-grid operations and enhances the flexibility and reliability of load supply within the distribution network.
