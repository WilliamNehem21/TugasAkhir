The Scott style precisely captures continuous dcpos, and it also introduced the concept of a general algebraic information system, which encompasses algebraic domains by imposing additional rules on general continuous information systems. However, the general algebraic information system presented by Scott and his colleagues contained numerous rules. This paper aims to present a new class of algebraic information systems that only consists of four rules.

L-domains were initially introduced independently by Coquand and Jung. Jung demonstrated that l-domains constitute a maximal Cartesian closed full subcategory of continuous domains. This is also applicable in the algebraic context. Spreen identified a subset of continuous information systems capable of representing l-domains; however, these information systems are constrained by numerous conditions, making them challenging to evaluate.

The algebraic domain category, denoted as algdom, treats algebraic domains as objects and Scott continuous functions as morphisms. The algebraic l-domain category is a full subcategory of algdom, denoted as algldom, in which all objects are algebraic l-domains. Additional results on domain theory are available in existing literature. Further information on category theory can also be found in previous works.

The validity of Proposition 3.9 is evident due to the property of algebraic semilattice. Proposition 3.9 serves as a straightforward example of the generalization of algebraic information systems. By incorporating additional conditions, it becomes possible to derive subclasses of algebraic domains, such as algebraic lattice and algebraic Scott domain. The subsequent section provides a concise portrayal of information systems.

Algebraic l-domains hold particular significance in domain theory due to their characterization as a maximal Cartesian closed full subcategory of algebraic continuous domains. Nevertheless, representing algebraic l-domains through an information system proves to be challenging. The primary obstacle in developing an information system description of algebraic l-domains lies in characterizing consistent sets that represent local supremum. This section defines a subset of algebraic information systems that precisely captures algebraic l-domains.
