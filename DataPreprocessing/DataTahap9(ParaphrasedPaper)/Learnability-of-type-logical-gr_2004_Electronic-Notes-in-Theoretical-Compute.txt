This academic paper briefly outlines a method for learning a lexical assignment along with a system of syntactic and semantic categories using a fixed type-logical grammar. The grammar's underlying logic is a decidable modally enriched extension of the Lambek calculus, with constraints to ensure that an infinite set of categories is not used to generate the language. The paper demonstrates that, under these conditions, specific linguistically valuable subsets of the algorithm's range can be identified from data containing sentences labeled by simply typed lambda calculus meaning terms in normal form. However, it also refutes a mistaken result from a previous version of the paper, showing that the entire range of the algorithm is not a learnable class. The author argues informally that, with the appropriate type logic, learnable grammar classes can encompass those that generate natural languages, suggesting that natural languages can be learned in this manner.

The paper introduces the concept of type logic, defined as any cut-free decidable multimodal extension of the Lambek calculus enriched by multiple combination modes and families of unary modalities. A type-logical grammar is then described as a triple consisting of a vocabulary, a lexical assignment function, and a type logic.

Modal operators are introduced to allow the use of structural rules, limiting their application to specific contexts. Extended type logics incorporate multiple families of slash operators, which are indexed using subscripts and referred to as modes of combination.

The paper presents a general algorithm for learning a syntactic category system for a natural language alongside a lexical assignment that defines a fully descriptive grammar. It notes that the syntax can be handled using any cut-free decidable multimodal type-logical grammar, with the learning data consisting of term-labeled strings representing sentences annotated by typed lambda calculus meaning recipes. An example of a term-labeled string is provided.

The paper concludes by establishing a lemma that, given a decidable type logic meeting certain conditions, there is a bounded number of distinct lexicons without useless types for any learning sample of term-labeled strings that exhausts the vocabulary.

In summary, the paper introduces a method for learning lexical assignment and syntactic and semantic categories using a fixed type-logical grammar. It also discusses the use of modal operators and extended type logics in this context and presents a general algorithm for learning a descriptive grammar.
