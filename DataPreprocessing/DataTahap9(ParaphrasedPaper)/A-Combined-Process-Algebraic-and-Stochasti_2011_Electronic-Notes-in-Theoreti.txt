We present a novel stochastic model of bone remodeling that captures the timescale consistency with biological processes after a micro-fracture. Our approach combines systems biology and shape calculus to bridge the scales from cellular to tissue levels. The paper introduces the main actors and key events in bone remodeling, highlighting the stochasticity and discreteness in the system's behavior. It also discusses the role of osteocytes in regulating BMU activity and the rankl/rank signaling in regulating osteoclast formation. 

The bone remodeling process, conducted by osteoclasts and osteoblasts forming basic multi-cellular units (BMUs), involves highly coordinated regulation. Osteocytes in the bone matrix serve as mechanosensors and regulate BMU activity, while the rankl/rank signaling pathway controls osteoclast formation and bone turnover. A stochastic modeling approach is proposed to better fit experimental data considering the noise component and the discrete nature of the bone remodeling process. This modeling approach provides a more biologically sound representation compared to previous continuous models. The paper concludes with a discussion of related and future work in this area.

Our modeling approach integrates the dynamics of osteoclasts and osteoblasts at the cellular level with the shape calculus to represent the high-level control affecting bone size and shape, inspired by the Vitruvian man. In addition, the movement of osteoclasts is determined by both a random walk and the concentration gradient of rankl signals produced by osteocytes and osteoblasts. The interactions between osteoclasts and osteoblasts are shown to play a crucial role in the coordination of bone remodeling activity.
