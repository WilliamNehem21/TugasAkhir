The remaining sections of this paper are structured as follows: Section 2 provides a review of relevant literature. Section 3 presents the wavelet methodology, effective price correlation, and causation measures. Sections 4 and 5 outline the data set and present the empirical results, respectively. Section 6 discusses the theoretical and methodological contributions as well as practical implications for academics, policymakers, and practitioners. Finally, Section 7 concludes the paper.

Numerous studies have examined the mechanisms of price discovery for futures contracts on different exchanges trading the same underlying commodities. It is generally agreed that markets with higher liquidity attract more trading activity, but traders sometimes adjust liquidity to ensure effective hedging (Silber, 1981). Granger causality (Granger, 1969) is often used to investigate the transmission of information between markets, while cointegration methods (Granger, 1981) are popular for studying the joint relationships among multiple price series. Additionally, error correction models have been utilized to formalize the data-generating processes of cointegration relationships (Engle and Granger, 1987), and these methods are well-suited for exploring price discovery in multiple areas of agricultural commodities. The economic rationale behind the cointegration relationship is the law of one price (Ardeni, 1989).

The study results suggest that both the US and Chinese soybean markets are likely to be positively correlated with price differences. Thus, an increase (decrease) in soybean prices, whether in US or Chinese quotes, would lead to an increase (reduction) in the spread between US and Chinese prices due to inherent linkages between the three series. This implies that relative price levels play a crucial role in driving US soybean futures returns, and vice versa.

Furthermore, the US soybean market was found to be less influenced by price differences during the post-tariff and post-trade agreement periods. Due to a significant increase in US soybean inventory during the trade war, the price sensitivity of the US soybean market decreased. As a result, an increase in Chinese soybean prices would not necessarily cause an increase in US soybean prices, widening the price gap between the two.

The study contributes methodologically to the literature on commodity market data in several ways. Firstly, it highlights the advantages of employing wavelet analysis to characterize complex cyclical relationships and time-varying correlations that may be missed in typical cointegration and causality approaches. Secondly, the analysis establishes intercountry price differences as a key factor in soybean futures price discovery based on theoretical notions of market integration. Additionally, the study examines the impacts of major exogenous events such as political events represented by trade wars and public health events represented by pandemics, revealing a new application of the wavelet approach in data science.

This study utilized the wavelet method to analyze the dynamic relationship between US and Chinese soybean futures, given the recent substantial increase in China's soybean imports and the growing trading volumes in the Chinese soybean futures market. This research contributes to the existing literature by aiding in the understanding of price discovery dynamics between the US and China in the globally important soybean market.
