This scholarly article discusses the concept of locally irregular graphs and their decomposition. It describes a graph as locally irregular if any two adjacent vertices have different degrees. The paper introduces the idea of a locally irregular decomposition of a graph, which involves breaking the graph into locally irregular subgraphs. The term "decomposable" is used to describe a graph that can be broken down into locally irregular subgraphs. The paper presents a proof that any decomposable split graph with a clique of at least 10 vertices can be decomposed into at most three locally irregular subgraphs. Additionally, the paper explores the characterization of graphs that can be decomposed into one or two locally irregular subgraphs.

In section 2.1, the paper presents the proofs of Lemmas 2.3 and 2.4, using a specific coloring of e(kn) referred to as "normal" in Definition 2.1. In section 2.2, the paper discusses the proof of Lemma 2.7, which involves analyzing the properties of normal colorings and the existence of a conflicting edge.

The paper concludes that based on the defined normal colorings and other properties, certain graphs are locally irregular, while others are not, depending on the parity of the number of vertices. For even n, one set of subgraphs is locally irregular, and for odd n, a different set is locally irregular.
