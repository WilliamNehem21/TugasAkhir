The fundamental interaction principles of PEP are inspired by processes such as endocytosis and exocytosis, which involve the uptake and release of materials by cells through the cell membrane. These interaction primitives exhibit a property called bitonality, which ensures that the internal and external contents of a membrane never mix, although external entities can be brought inside if enclosed by another membrane. Endocytosis, which can engulf multiple membranes, is replaced by simpler operations like phagocytosis and pinocytosis in order to enhance control over the process.

Similarly, the principles of MBD draw inspiration from membrane fusion and fission processes. To make membrane fission more manageable, two simplified operations, namely budding and dripping, are employed instead. An encoding of MBD primitives in PEP is provided, and it is noted that there is no reverse encoding due to differences in the nesting structure of membranes between the two systems.

Universal termination is shown to be a decidable property for MBD, based on the theory of well-structured transition systems. The decidability of universal termination highlights an expressive difference between MBD and PEP, as it is possible to deterministically encode random access machines in PEP but not in MBD. This also implies that it is not feasible to encode PEP in MBD in a way that preserves universal termination.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces the syntax and semantics of the two calculi, while Section 3 presents the deterministic encoding of random access machines in PEP. Section 4 discusses the decidability of universal termination for MBD. Further sections delve into non-deterministic and deterministic encodings of RAMs in MBD, followed by conclusive remarks in Section 7.

The standard, interleaving semantics are then explained, and generic reaction rules are provided for all brane calculi. Definitions and details specific to PEP and MBD are presented subsequently in the paper.

A model for representing random access machines in PEP is described, based on an encoding function that operates on instructions and registers independently. The encoding is shown to have a property where the termination of the RAM corresponds to at least one terminating computation in the encoding.

An ordering relation on the derivatives of a system in normal form is defined, leading to the decidability of termination. The encoding may lead to divergence in certain cases, attributed to the inability to perform a zero test on the contents of registers.

The paper discusses the comparison between non-deterministic and deterministic models, emphasizing the interest of the research community in membrane computing. Moreover, it highlights the use of well-structured transition systems theory to analyze properties such as control state maintainability, inevitability, and boundedness for a relevant fragment of the full brane calculus.

In summary, the paper demonstrates the decidable nature of universal termination in MBD, utilizing well-structured transition systems theory. It also explores the applications of these results in the analysis of biological pathways.
