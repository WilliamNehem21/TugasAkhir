This paper introduces a fast search algorithm for vector quantization (VQ) known as binary search space VQ (BSS-VQ) and demonstrates its effectiveness in enhancing the line spectrum pair (LSP) encoder of the G.729 standard. By leveraging trade-off and learning aspects, the BSS-VQ approach achieves significant computational savings while only incurring a slight loss in quantization quality. Specifically, the proposed approach utilizes a binary search space developed through a learning process, which is trained using the full search VQ (FSVQ) as an inferred function. Experimental results show that the BSS-VQ approach achieves computational savings of 86.19% with a quantization accuracy of 98.15%, affirming its excellent performance in the context of the LSP encoder of the G.729 standard.

Additionally, the paper introduces the quasi-binary search (QBS) algorithm and explores the trade-off aspect between true binary search VQ (TSVQ) and the QBS algorithm to reduce the computational complexity of the VQ algorithm. The QBS algorithm demonstrates superiority over TSVQ, particularly for noise-like input signals, and operates independently of the correlation characteristics of input signals. While the quantization accuracy of the QBS algorithm is reasonably good at 99.16%, the achieved computational savings of 59.43% for the LSP encoder of the G.729 standard are deemed unsatisfactory.

Compared to previous studies, this paper emphasizes the development of the BSS-VQ approach specifically for the LSP encoder of the G.729 standard. The proposed approach strikes a balance between computational savings and quantization quality, achieving considerable computational savings with minimal impact on quantization quality. Furthermore, the paper integrates learning aspects from neural networks and VQ to further enhance the performance of the BSS-VQ approach. Experimental results using the LSP encoder in the G.729 standard confirm the effectiveness of the BSS-VQ approach.

The study presents a fast search BSS-VQ algorithm that utilizes a fast locating approach to determine a small search space and fully searches it to obtain an optimally matched codeword. A learning algorithm is proposed to build a BSS by training it using large amounts of training data. However, shortcomings exist in the learning process, as insufficient training may result in missed encoding in certain regions, while excessive training may lead to highly overlapped codewords, both of which can impact quantization accuracy and computational savings. The study provides detailed algorithms for the generation of the BSS as well as the BSS-VQ encoding process.

The BSS-VQ algorithm is evaluated using the LSP encoder in the G.729 standard with a 10-d codebook and 128 codewords. The authors utilize a speech database containing male speech, female speech, background noise, and silence to verify the performance of BSS-VQ, showing promising results.

In summary, the BSS-VQ algorithm demonstrates its effectiveness in enhancing the LSP encoder of the G.729 standard by leveraging trade-off and learning aspects, achieving optimal performance, and outperforming existing algorithms in this context.
