When a company assumes an orchestration role, it coordinates a business process in order to complete the work. This process can either be static or dynamic. In traditional outsourcing contracts, a static orchestration is typically employed, in which the process is defined from the beginning and partners and services remain constant. However, for newer paradigms such as virtual organizations, partners and services can be selected on-the-fly.

The SSE-CMM (System Security Engineering Capability Maturity Model) assesses a security management process by assigning a maturity level (ranging from 1 to 5) to a security system engineering process. This level of maturity reflects how effectively the organization fulfills all base practices.

Risk analysis is a prominent approach in assessing security system, with the most commonly used metric being annual monetary loss. However, if other dimensions such as hours of downtime and reputation are also taken into account, the organization's losses cannot be solely measured in currency, necessitating the use of some form of normalization.

In order to ensure that the promised level is achieved, it is important to use metrics. Traditional Service Level Agreement (SLA) metrics measure various aspects of the process and reflect the quality of service in meeting business objectives. Identifying these metrics is a fundamental stage in agreement negotiation, as it is crucial for the client to ensure that its objectives are fully reflected and that the selected metrics are relevant to its needs. Additionally, the quality of protection should also be represented by metrics.

For example, the speed of connection should not be less than 256 bits/s, and nobody would complain if the speed is higher. On the other hand, the number of successful virus attacks should not exceed 10 per month, and nobody would complain if the number of successful attacks is lower.

In contrast, if the primary goal of outsourcing is to transfer security services, then a SLA should be specified for those activities. In this case, the functional service being outsourced is simply a service with its specific function being security. Therefore, it is important to distinguish when security is the service itself, requiring an SLA, from the case in which security protects the object of the service, necessitating a PLA (Protection Level Agreement). For instance, if we are outsourcing a key generation function for identity-based cryptography, a SLA should be established for the minimum key size, whereas a PLA should be set up to protect our identities or our private key.

When considering external metrics for Quality of Protection (QoP), we do not recommend metrics based on risk analysis and financial results. These metrics have several limitations and are not precise, and qualitative analysis further compounds these limitations since it operates with relative values (e.g., high, medium, low). Additionally, these values are not connected to the service provided and cannot be mutually monitored by the contractor and the client in an agreed-upon manner. This does not mean that clients should not use risk analysis to identify the appropriate PLA; it simply means that the outcomes of the risk analysis, such as annualized loss expectancy (ALE), should not themselves be used as a PLA.

Methods that estimate a security level are based on a set of questions to assess compliance with standards, which are divided into protection domains (e.g., cryptography, audit, networking). This set can be further divided into threat domains (e.g., protection against viruses, password sniffing, denial of service attacks). Upon completing this process, a comprehensive set of parameters and corresponding internal metrics that contribute to threat protection is obtained.

One of the early papers discussing security SLA in a large enterprise provides a method to ensure compliance of the system with fifteen security domains split into best practices. For each best practice, the security service level is determined and added to the SLA. This approach extends the security division to compare two SLAs or to find a security SLA that closely matches the desired one. Similarly, a similar divide-and-conquer technique is applied to evaluate web service security as well.
