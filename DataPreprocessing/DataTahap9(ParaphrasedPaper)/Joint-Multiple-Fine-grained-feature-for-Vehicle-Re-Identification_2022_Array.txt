The identification of the same vehicle in different scenes is referred to as vehicle re-identification, which is a subtask of image retrieval in the domain of computer vision. However, challenges arise due to variations in the locations of surveillance cameras, leading to obstacles in captured vehicle images and alterations in the vehicle's appearance from multiple viewpoints. In response to this, we propose a multi-fine-grained feature extraction network to mitigate the impact of obstacle occlusion, multiple viewpoints, and other factors on vehicle re-identification.

Our approach involves preserving the global vehicle information while extracting precise fine-grained features by segmenting the vehicle feature map. Additionally, we introduce a new evaluation metric, mean inverse negative penalty (minp), to comprehensively assess the vehicle re-identification model. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on challenging vehicle datasets, such as veri-776, vehicleid, and vric.

The paper outlines the significance of vehicle re-identification and highlights the interference factors present in real-world vehicle images captured by surveillance cameras. It also discusses the adoption of feature extraction from rough to fine, emphasizing the use of local feature information to refine vehicle features and enhance vehicle re-identification accuracy.

Further, our work introduces feature map segmentation combined with a channel attention mechanism to extract multiple fine-grained features of vehicles, aiming to improve the accuracy of vehicle re-identification. We also follow a specific testing protocol and employ various evaluation metrics to objectively evaluate the performance of our model.

During the training stage, we use a learning rate schedule and batch size, and our approach differs from others by utilizing feature map segmentation and channel attention mechanism to extract fine-grained features of vehicles, as well as feature alignment to facilitate similar feature matching.

Overall, our work presents a multi-fine-grained feature extraction network for vehicle re-identification, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling vehicle obstructions. Experimental results on veri-776, vehicleid, and vric datasets confirm the superior performance of our proposed approach, and the introduction of the minp metric is shown to be effective in evaluating the model's performance.
