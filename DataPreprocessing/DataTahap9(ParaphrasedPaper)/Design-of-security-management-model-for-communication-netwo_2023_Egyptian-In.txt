The research work identified significant limitations in three main aspects: the complexity and dynamism of human factors pose challenges in comprehensively capturing and addressing atypical human factors affecting communication networks of mobile games; the increasing complexity of communication networks due to the influence of the metaverse necessitates adjustments to the applicability of security management models; and the potential subjectivity in security evaluations conducted by experts requires methods to reduce subjective influences.

Prior research has primarily focused on technical optimization and hardware transformation in the context of security management for communication networks in mobile games and digital cultural consumption. However, there is a pressing need to shift focus towards understanding and addressing security management from the perspective of players, who have become a dominant force in mobile games and digital cultural consumption under the metaverse.

The paper adopted a multidimensional approach, utilizing player interviews and literature analysis to identify factors affecting the security management of communication networks in mobile games, categorizing these factors into six dimensions: physiological, physical, pathological, pharmacological, psychological, and psychosocial.

The paper emphasized the importance of designing evaluation indicators to identify human factors affecting security management, and underlined the significance of security evaluations and the establishment of a security threshold to achieve a secure state. The 3e rule, which emphasizes the management of human motivation to prevent human errors, was proposed as a method to address indicators below the security threshold.

Furthermore, the paper detailed specific countermeasures within the 3e rule, including engineering techniques, education, and enforcement, and highlighted the importance of setting criteria for fixing the threshold value as a critical step in the attainment of the security threshold.

The influence of players on security management was underscored, particularly in the context of the metaverse, and it was noted that players play a pivotal role in both designing and consuming digital cultural content through communication networks. Additionally, the paper showcased the design of a security management model specifically focused on players in the context of mobile games, highlighting the growing importance of various factors and the practical significance of managing communication network risks.

Furthermore, the paper reported specific results and conclusions, including the influence of players in digital cultural consumption, design of the security management model, and the management of risks in communication networks. It highlighted the validity and practical significance of the proposed security management model.

Finally, the contributions and roles of various authors in the research were acknowledged, including their involvement in investigation, project administration, validation, formal analysis, conceptualization, data curation, methodology, resources, visualization, drafting, review, editing, supervision, funding acquisition, and software.
