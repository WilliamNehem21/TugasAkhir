In recent years, the wine industry has been embracing new technologies to enhance production methods, with a particular focus on environmentally friendly grape acquisition and quality selection for wine production. Traditional laboratorial analysis of oenological parameters has drawbacks, as it involves the destruction of grapes and is time and cost-intensive. Therefore, the industry has turned to hyperspectral imaging as a method to obtain detailed information about grapes without causing damage. This paper outlines the use of hyperspectral imaging in predicting oenological parameters, such as sugar content and pH index, for different vintages of wine grape berries. The study evaluates the performance of t-SNE and Kernel t-SNE techniques for dimensionality reduction in real-world hyperspectral images of wine grape berries. The results demonstrate that t-SNE and kernel t-SNE techniques outperform principal component analysis (PCA) in predicting oenological parameters, highlighting their potential for real-world applications. This research contributes to the ongoing efforts in leveraging new technologies to enhance wine production and sets guidelines for future improvements in this area.
