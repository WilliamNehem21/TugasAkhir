The original concept of projections was introduced and developed in a specific context to address the issue of congestion in Euler diagrams as more sets are considered. Informally, a projection represents a set within a particular context, and outside of this context, it does not assert anything. A projection can be represented in different ways by curves known as projected contours. The paper outlines a system of Euler diagrams that incorporates projections and discusses two weaknesses of this system.

A concrete Euler diagram with projections consists of given contours with unique labels and projected contours, represented with dashed lines, which may not have unique labels. All contours are contained within a boundary rectangle, and the way they intersect, contain, or exclude each other divides the area within the boundary rectangle into distinct zones, which may be shaded. A non-empty set of zones is referred to as a region.

Diagrammatic systems typically have a two-tiered syntax: a concrete syntax for the diagrammatic representation and an abstract syntax that retains only essential relationships. The notation of projections introduces a three-tiered syntax, dividing the abstract syntax into fine-grained and coarse-grained levels. The fine-grained abstract syntax provides detailed information for applying reasoning rules, while the coarse-grained abstract syntax groups together multiple fine-grained types with the same interpretation.

The fine-grained abstract syntax records how a diagram uses projected contours to represent a projection. It includes a set of underlying zones (defined in terms of given contour labels only), and a projected contour consists of a label and the set of underlying zones (an underlying region) it intersects, referred to as the context of the projected contours. Any two projected contours sharing a label will have disjoint contexts.

The paper discusses how the three relations between contours in a diagram contribute different quantities of clutter to the components of the diagram. It highlights the challenge of extracting information from the diagram, identifying components and their relations, and computing the variation in clutter between components.

To score these diagrams, the paper proposes a method of contour scoring, which involves counting the number of zones within each contour and summing them. Using this method, the paper demonstrates the contour scores for the diagrams discussed and relates the scoring to the factors that contribute to clutter.

Overall, the paper introduces the concept of projections in the context of Euler diagrams, discusses their syntax and scoring, and emphasizes their implications for managing clutter in diagrams.
