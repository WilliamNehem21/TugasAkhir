The utilization of biomass is on the rise due to its status as a sustainable energy source widely recognized as a viable alternative to fossil fuels. Biomass, which consists of organic materials used for generating heat energy, includes waste products such as wood chips, sawdust, and various agricultural residues like rice husks, rice straw, bagasse, sugarcane leaves, palm kernel shells, and coconut shells from agro-industrial factories. These waste materials are processed into biomass pellets in order to enhance their value, with the current preference for biomass in pellet form attributed to its low moisture content, high density, consistent size, and ease of storage, management, and transportation due to its grain-like flow characteristics (Zafar, 2022).

The formula used to calculate the absolute reflectance value of the biomass pellets is given by rsample = (rdark-rwhite). The rdark, representing the reflectance of the background (dark reference), was obtained when the light source unit was turned off, while rwhite, the reflectance value of the acrylic sheet (white reference), was obtained by scanning a Teflon whiteboard. The reflectance values were utilized to create a prediction model in the subsequent step.

The study explores the development of an optimal model for predicting the true density utilizing different spectral pre-treatments and variable selection methods. Prior to model creation, both the raw spectra and the pre-treated spectra, including the first derivative (d1), second derivative (d2), and standard normal variate (SNV), were employed. The model's optimization involved the use of selected wavelengths obtained from the correlation method (CM), variance method (VM), covariance method (COVM), successive projections algorithm (SPA), and genetic algorithm (GA). The performance of these methods was then compared. Variable selection was further investigated, including the use of CM, VM, COVM, SPA, and GA. The study also examined partial least squares (PLS) regression, which combines the advantages of both the genetic algorithm (GA) and partial least squares (PLS) regression (Sratthaphut and Ruangwises, 2012). Pitak et al. (2021b) reported that a model developed using the genetic algorithm (GA) wavelength and PLS regression provided higher accuracy for elemental prediction (C, H, N, and S) compared to a model developed using the full wavelength range.

The criteria for assessing the prediction model determined that an R-squared (R2) value between 0.81 and 0.90 and a residual prediction deviation (RPD) value between 2.5 and 3 indicate a good prediction model, an R2 value between 0.66 and 0.80 and an RPD value between 2.0 and 2.5 indicate an approximate prediction model, while an R2 value below 0.66 and an RPD value below 2 indicate a poor prediction. Thus, the model exhibited excellent performance and could be utilized for quality measurement. The relative standard deviation of prediction (RSEP), representing the relative ratio of the absolute error of prediction to a reference value, indicated that every predicted value yielded an error of approximately 6.40% of the reference value.
