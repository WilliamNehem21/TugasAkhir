The current focus of research lies in exploring the optimal operation and engagement of virtual power plants (VPPs) in electricity markets. A VPP is formed by aggregating distributed energy resources (DERs) to interact with the electricity market as a single entity. The DERs include smaller capacity generators or those facing significant trading risks when operating independently. By creating a VPP, a single entity is formed with a larger power capacity and a unified power generation profile through the aggregation of diverse generators. This allows the VPP to incorporate market intelligence and optimize its participation in the electricity market. The sample average approximation (SAA) technique is employed to address the stochastic nature of optimization problems associated with VPPs, providing a methodology for solving these complex problems. This paper aims to present a detailed examination of the SAA methodology and its implementation with a focus on risk-averse stochastic programming formulations for VPPs.

The problem statement and a description of the VPP under investigation are outlined in Section 2, followed by a discussion of stochastic models and objective functions in Section 3. The application of the SAA approach and the implementation of two solution procedures are explained in Section 4, while sampling techniques are presented in Section 5. Computational results are discussed in Section 6, and conclusions are summarized in Section 7. Furthermore, the paper provides appendices with the deterministic model of the VPP and additional computational results.

The study involves the consideration of various factors such as uncertainty in wind speeds, electricity prices, and imbalance costs that impact the electricity trading processes. The methodologies presented in this work provide techniques for estimating the optimal objective function value and solution, contributing to the decision-making process. The computational techniques explored in this paper contribute to the development of risk-averse stochastic programming formulations for VPPs, aiming to enhance decision-making in electricity market participation.
