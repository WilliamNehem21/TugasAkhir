Any space that satisfies axiom (l2) also fulfills axiom (l3), but not necessarily the other way around. The convergence relation of a topological space Z meets the axioms of a limit space. We refer to the weak limit space obtained from this as ltop(Z). A weak limit space is referred to as topological if it belongs to the image of ltop.
