The process of image reconstruction is often considered an ill-posed problem, wherein small changes to the input can lead to significant unexpected alterations in the output. Various regularization techniques, such as half-quadratic regularization, directional regularization, and adaptive regularization, have been proposed to address this issue. However, Tikhonov regularization remains one of the most commonly used methods due to its ease of implementation and speed. This regularization approach imposes constraints and transforms the problem into a minimization task. Despite its implementation advantages, resulting images often fail to preserve edges and may exhibit global smoothness and ringing artifacts. These effects are attributed to the regularization parameter, which governs the extent of regularization applied to the problem and the selection of appropriate parameters has been discussed.

In the context of image recovery, if the number of measurements is substantially smaller than the number of ideal image pixels, the problem becomes under-determined and the complete recovery of the image is not feasible. Conversely, if the measurements greatly exceed the number of ideal image pixels, the system becomes over-determined, leading to noise attenuation but also information disregarding. For a fully determined system, the number of independent measurements should exceed the number of image pixels in the restored image.

In MRI, a key challenge for super-resolution (SR) is to enhance resolution in the slice-select dimension (i.e., reducing slice thickness) to achieve high-resolution, isotropic 3D images without compromising signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). While SR in MRI shows potential for resolution enhancement, there is a significant question within the MRI community regarding whether SR offers advantages over direct high-resolution 3D acquisition when considering SNR and acquisition times. Through extensive analysis, Plenge et al. have demonstrated, through an evaluation framework, that SR is capable of achieving this.

The regularization parameter k governs the level of regularization applied to the reconstruction process. Larger values of k generally lead to smoother solutions, which is beneficial when only a limited number of low-resolution images are available (an under-determined problem) or when observed data fidelity is low due to registration error and noise. Conversely, if a large number of low-resolution images are available and the amount of noise is small, a smaller k value will result in a good solution. Generally, the selection of k can be done manually through visual inspection or automatically using methods such as the discrepancy principle, generalized cross-validation, and the L-curve.

To ensure that the parameter k is not excessively rough, a minimum value (kmin) is established. Leveraging properties of MR medical images, an appropriate value for each element of the parameter can be evaluated through three factors: a, kmin, and kmax. Local gradient information is utilized to determine where and to what degree regularization should be applied, offering an advantage in restoring local edges and suppressing noise based on local information.

The resolution of images was quantified by measuring edge sharpness, as edges play a critical role in medical imaging. Greenspan et al. have proposed a mathematical formula for measuring the width of each edge by fitting it to a sigmoid function.

We have introduced an efficient approach for merging multiple MRI scans within a super-resolution framework. This technique involves combining multiple MRI scans with different slice orientations, which offers a more natural path to achieving isotropic image resolution than multiple acquisitions at the same orientation with sub-pixel offsets. The approach also utilizes a super-resolution algorithm with an adaptive regularization parameter. Experimental results have demonstrated significant resolution enhancement in the reconstructed isotropic 3D MRI volume. The modified regularization parameter method has proven effective in preserving edges and improving sharpness.
