The paper introduces and evaluates a novel filter class for processing multichannel images. This new technique for enhancing images demonstrates the capability to effectively reduce impulsive and Gaussian noise, and it performs significantly better than traditional methods of noise reduction. The paper presents a smoothing operator that utilizes a random walk model and a fuzzy similarity measure between pixels connected by a digital geodesic path. The efficiency of the proposed method was assessed using objective image quality measures on standard color images. The results demonstrate that the new method not only surpasses standard noise reduction algorithms but also offers valuable features for segmenting noisy color images.

The vector median filter (VMF) is the most widely recognized order statistics filter. The definition of the multichannel median is an immediate expansion of the conventional single-channel median definition. VMF employs the L1 or L2 norm to arrange vectors based on their relative magnitude differences.
