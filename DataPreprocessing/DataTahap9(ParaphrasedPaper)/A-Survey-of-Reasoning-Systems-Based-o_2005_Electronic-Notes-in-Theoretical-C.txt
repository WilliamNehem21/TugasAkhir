Euler diagrams have a long history of being used to convey ideas in a natural and intuitive manner. Recent research efforts have focused on developing formal reasoning systems based on Euler diagrams, with many of these systems expanding the syntax to enhance their expressiveness. This paper provides a survey of such systems and offers comparisons between them.

Various semantic interpretations have been proposed for Euler diagrams, with zones in the diagrams representing sets and the union of all sets represented by the zones forming the universal set. Some interpretations specify that each zone represents a nonempty set, while others do not impose this restriction. An examination of the semantics of Euler diagrams can be found in this paper.

In certain systems, spiders in diagrams represent the existence of elements and are referred to as existential spiders. Conversely, some spider diagram systems employ constant spiders, which are always labeled and are akin to constants in first-order logic.

The first spider diagram system proven to be both sound and complete was the SD1 system, which incorporates existential spiders but not constant spiders. In SD1, existential spiders cannot have nodes placed in shaded zones, and the diagrams are based on Venn diagrams rather than Euler diagrams.

The distinction between abstract and concrete syntax, analogous to that in graph theory, is emphasized, with the abstract syntax providing precision and formality in different aspects of the notation. Furthermore, the use of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) as an abstract representation of Euler/Venn diagrams is highlighted for checking the correctness of reasoning steps.

Additionally, the paper discusses the SD2 system, which extends SD1 by allowing spiders to have nodes placed in shaded zones, enabling the expression of arbitrary finite upper bounds on the cardinalities of sets. The paper outlines reasoning rules for SD2 and emphasizes the importance of embedding spiders in concrete Euler diagrams.

In summary, this paper provides an overview of various reasoning systems that have extended the capabilities of Euler diagrams, highlighting their soundness and completeness. It also discusses the expressiveness of these systems, culminating in the full constraint diagram notation, which is likely to be undecidable but sufficiently expressive for practical applications.
