The pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis involves a combination of genetic, environmental, microbial, and immune factors, resulting in an inappropriate mucosal immune response mediated by mucosal T cells. This triggers the release of proinflammatory mediators, such as reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, neutrophil infiltration, and overproduction of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, leading to tissue damage and the progression of the disease.

Current pharmacological treatments for inflammatory bowel disease often come with serious side effects and low efficacy, and many patients do not respond well to these treatments. As a result, there is increasing interest in complementary medicine approaches, such as using extracts from medicinal plants or natural active compounds.

In a study, the leaves of Ocimum gratissimum were collected, dried, and ground into a fine powder to obtain an aqueous extract. Rats were then treated with different doses of this extract, and various parameters including antioxidant status, neutrophil infiltration, histological changes, and hematological analysis were evaluated.

The study found that the administration of the aqueous extract of Ocimum gratissimum leaves led to significant improvements in several aspects of ulcerative colitis in the rats. The extract was found to exert antioxidant effects, reduce neutrophil infiltration, improve hematological parameters, and mitigate tissue damage in the colon. Additionally, it promoted weight gain and reduced diarrhea symptoms in the treated rats. These findings suggest that the extract may have potential as a therapeutic agent for ulcerative colitis by alleviating the symptoms and mitigating tissue damage associated with the disease.
