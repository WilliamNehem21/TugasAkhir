The presence of this disease causes the development of white spots on the leaves, starting as small spots that progressively grow to cover the entire leaf surface, resulting in the loss of chlorophyll and negatively impacting photosynthesis. Severe infections of this disease can also produce symptoms similar to cassava mosaic, as affected leaves dry out, shrink, and detach from the plant.

This disease is transmitted by whiteflies and its symptoms include distinctive yellowing of the veins, which may enlarge to form large patches of yellow discoloration. Additionally, symptoms of this disease on the tuber roots include the presence of dark-brown necrotic areas and a reduction in root size.

The disease exhibits various foliar symptoms such as mottling, mosaic rust, twisted leaves, and a general decrease in leaf size and plant health. Affected leaves typically display a combination of green, yellow, and white patches, which reduce the surface area available for photosynthesis, ultimately leading to stunted growth and reduced crop yield.

The presented dataset encountered challenges such as its small size, which could lead to overfitting, as well as highly imbalanced class distribution, with a notable bias towards certain disease classes. Additionally, the images in the dataset demonstrated poor resolution and low contrast. This study proposed the use of deep learning techniques, including the algorithmic method using class weights, focal loss as a loss function for addressing extreme class imbalance, and a hybrid method through resampling the minority class using the SMOTE technique.

The issue of label skew was also addressed, emphasizing the importance of considering class imbalance in machine learning models. The paper stressed that the failure of a model to perform in real-world scenarios despite achieving high accuracy in training can be attributed to class imbalance, and it highlighted the necessity of techniques to counter this issue.

The study developed and trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using a limited dataset that was heavily biased towards specific disease classes. Several techniques were employed to address class imbalance, including the use of class weights, focal loss, SMOTE, and different image dimensions. The results showed promising improvements in model performance, with the potential for integration into mobile applications for real-time monitoring and early warning of cassava infections.

The authors found that rectifying class imbalance through techniques such as class weighting, SMOTE, focal loss, and data augmentation, combined with the use of larger image dimensions, significantly improved the performance of the model for an imbalanced dataset. The experiment resulted in an increase in accuracy of over 5% and a significant reduction in log loss. However, the study noted that further research is needed to address the detection of multiple co-occurring diseases on the same plant.
