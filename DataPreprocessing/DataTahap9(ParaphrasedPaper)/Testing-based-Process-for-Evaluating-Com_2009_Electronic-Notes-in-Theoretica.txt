Replacing components in a component-based system can jeopardize its stability, so it is crucial to carefully identify the substitutability of components. This paper introduces a process for evaluating replacement components, which involves complementing the traditional compatibility analysis with component testing criteria. The analysis focuses on the behavior of components, particularly in terms of data transformation, and utilizes observability testing metrics. The paper also outlines the methodology for building a component behavior test suite, known as back-to-back testing, and implements the process through a tool called Testooj, which is designed for testing Java components.

The maintenance of component-based systems often involves replacing existing components with upgrades or new components, posing a risk to system stability due to the evolving nature of software and the potential impact of changes. The issue becomes even more challenging when components are acquired from different vendors and system integrators have limited control over deployment variables. As a result, it is essential to assess whether new releases or acquired components can safely replace existing components within a deployed component-based system.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of the proposed approach, Section 3 delves into the component behavior test suite, Section 4 covers the evaluation of interface compatibility, Section 5 describes the testing-based behavior compatibility analysis, Section 6 presents the results of an experiment, and Section 7 discusses related work. The paper concludes with a summary of findings and outlines areas for future research.

The first phase of the proposed process involves generating a test suite to capture the behavioral aspects of a component, aiming to represent its interactions with other components in the software system. This test suite is not intended to identify faults but to represent the behavior of the component. The generated test suite is then used to assess the compatibility of a candidate component with the original component by checking for behavioral consistency.

The approach also incorporates the concept of back-to-back testing, using a reference implementation to generate a test suite that exercises both the unit under test and the reference implementation. The goal of the test suite is to verify that the candidate component matches the behavior of the original component, and relevant component coverage notions are utilized to implement this strategy.

The testing-based behavior compatibility analysis involves validating the test suite against the candidate component, with test cases comprising calls to services of the original component. The approach utilizes methods inherited from the object class in Java and implements a wrapping approach to address interface correspondences and ensure semantic-level interface compatibility. This phase also involves applying operators to change service invocations and parameter values, aiming to find services from the candidate component that exhibit similar behavior to the original component.

In summary, the process proposed in the paper provides a systematic approach for evaluating the substitutability of components within a component-based system, effectively addressing potential risks to system stability.
