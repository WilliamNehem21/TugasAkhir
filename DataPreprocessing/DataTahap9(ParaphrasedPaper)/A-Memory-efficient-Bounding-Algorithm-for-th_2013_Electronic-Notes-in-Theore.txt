The issue of terminal-pair reliability has been the subject of extensive research since the 1960s. It involves assessing the reliability of a binary-state system with a redundancy structure represented by a combinatorial graph. The system components are represented by edges in the graph, each of which can be either working or failed, while the nodes are considered to be perfectly interconnected. Although the components fail independently on a statistical basis, it has been proven that the problem is NP-complete. Numerous algorithms have been developed over time, which can be classified into different categories.

The following section presents a detailed description of the modified algorithm, which generates an output file, fnext, by utilizing an input file, fprev, at each level of recursion. Upon initializing the input graph, files, and relevant maps in Procedure 1, Procedure 2 is executed to process the initial graph. This involves initially checking the connectivity of the graph. If the graph is found to be connected, potential reductions are then explored in line 12. Any changes in probabilities resulting from these reductions are updated in the epm at line 13. Additionally, adjustments made to the graph as a result of reductions are recorded in a string, as previously described, and this string is also appended to line 14. Furthermore, line is augmented with the respective subproblems based on the shortest paths, sp. Finally, line is written to the file fnext.
