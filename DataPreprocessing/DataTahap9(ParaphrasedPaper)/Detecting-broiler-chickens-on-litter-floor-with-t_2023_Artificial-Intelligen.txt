Poultry is a valuable source of protein, but it faces various challenges globally, including concerns about the welfare of birds raised in intensive management systems. The large numbers of chickens housed together can make accurate and efficient monitoring of their health and welfare a challenging task. While current monitoring of broiler houses is mainly done manually, this approach can be labor-intensive and prone to errors. An automatic broiler monitoring system could address these challenges by collecting individual bird data within a flock and providing essential information for digital management.

Deep learning technology offers powerful feature representation capabilities and fast processing speed, making it suitable for developing an automatic, efficient, and intelligent tool for animal farming. It has been successfully applied to the study of large animals such as pigs, sheep, and cattle, including tasks like object detection.

In this study, we enhanced the yolov5 algorithm by incorporating a convolutional block attention module (CBAM) to improve its ability to extract image features. The proposed yolov5cbam was trained and tested using a complex dataset of broiler images, including birds at different ages and in different pen settings, with both fresh and reused litter. This improved model demonstrated enhanced acquisition of small object features and improved accuracy in small target detection.

Jocher et al. (2020) developed the yolov5 algorithm, which was found to be more accurate and faster than the previous yolo model. The yolov5s network consists of three parts: backbone, neck, and prediction. Broiler chicken images were used as input for the backbone to obtain image features, the neck part was used to integrate the extracted feature information and generate feature maps, and the prediction part was used to generate bounding boxes and predict categories for the generated feature maps.

When detecting broiler chickens at different growth stages and in different scenes, occlusion or small targets can be challenging to detect due to their limited presence in the image and potential loss of feature information in the network. The CBAM module effectively addresses this issue by increasing the weight of occlusions or small targets in the entire feature map through channel and spatial attention modules, making the information easier to be learned by the network.

The proposed yolov5-cbam-broiler model, which integrates the CBAM into yolov5, has been shown to enhance overall detection performance, especially for small targets or occlusions. The results demonstrate the model's effective detection of broilers of different ages and provide a foundation for real-time target detection for intelligent poultry management.
