The detection of emotions through various means such as facial recognition, speech recognition, and heart-related parameters has been explored in recent research. It has been found that while facial recognition is an effective contactless tool for emotion recognition during computer interaction, heart-related parameters measured using smart wearables might offer a more accurate and unobtrusive way to measure emotions, particularly in dynamic or outdoor tasks. Emotion recognition has potential applications in various fields, including human-computer interaction, psychology (for identifying emotions in patients who cannot express their feelings, such as those with autism spectrum disorder or locked-in syndrome), and healthcare (for improving patient motivation and recovery through virtual avatars that adjust to the user's emotions). Emotions are conveyed through different modalities of communication, and advancements in technology have improved the possibilities for automated emotion recognition through various methods, each with its own advantages and limitations.

The choice of classifier for emotion detection can impact the accuracy of the results, with studies often using classifiers such as support vector machines or Fisher linear discriminant classifiers. Additionally, the cultural, age, and gender influences on visible parameters of emotion, such as facial expression and speech, need to be considered, as they may lead to the masking of true emotions. This issue can be addressed through multimodal systems and the measurement of internal parameters, such as changes in the autonomic nervous system, which may be more resistant to falsification.

Various bio-parameters, such as respiration patterns and skin temperature, have been explored as potential indicators of emotional states. Respiration patterns have been used to recognize emotions with moderate accuracy, while skin temperature measured on the finger-tip has been found to indicate relaxation or stress. However, the measurement and interpretation of these bio-parameters can vary in terms of accuracy, the number of recognized emotions, and mobility during measurement.

The use of smart wearables, such as smart watches and smart fabrics, offers the potential for mobile and unobtrusive measurement of bio-parameters related to emotions, such as electrocardiogram (ECG), electrodermal activity (EDA), skin temperature (SKT), blood volume pulse (BVP), and respiration (RSP). New developments in wearable technology, such as the empatica e4 wristband, have expanded the possibilities for measuring these bio-parameters in everyday activities, suggesting a shift away from traditional stationary methods for emotion recognition.

In summary, the research into automated emotion recognition through various modalities and bio-parameters offers exciting potential for applications in human-computer interaction, healthcare, and psychology, with the ongoing development of technology and smart wearables expanding the possibilities for accurate and unobtrusive measurement of emotions in diverse contexts.
