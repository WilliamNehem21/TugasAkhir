In contrast to its widespread use in mathematics, the kantorovich metric has only recently garnered attention in computer science. This paper provides a concise overview of its applications in probabilistic concurrency, image retrieval, data mining, and bioinformatics, highlighting its utility as a versatile mathematical tool for solving diverse problems across disparate domains.

Van Breugel and colleagues have utilized the kantorovich metric to define behavioral pseudometrics for fully probabilistic systems and reactive probabilistic systems, while Desharnais and others have applied it to labeled Markov chains and labeled concurrent Markov chains. Subsequently, Ferns et al. employed the kantorovich metric for Markov decision processes, and Deng et al. utilized it for action-labeled quantitative transition systems. When given a pseudometric m on a finite set of states, a common challenge in measuring the similarities of probabilistic processes' behavior is how to extend m appropriately.

This review has briefly highlighted several recent applications of the kantorovich metric in computer science. Generally, production planning problems span various research domains but ultimately revolve around the same mathematical problemâ€”the transportation problem. Therefore, it is likely that the kantorovich metric will find numerous additional applications in the future. For instance, it could be applied in knowledge representation, statistical clustering, data mining, information retrieval, bioinformatics, and other relevant areas that require effective methods for computing object similarities or dissimilarities.
