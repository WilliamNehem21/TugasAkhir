In recent years, there has been an increasing focus on advanced applications of sonic logs for evaluating gas-hydrate systems and their geological implications. While the monopole logging tool has limitations in measuring shear wave data from slow formations, new models integrating a multi-hidden layer extreme learning model (MELM) and optimization algorithms such as particle swarm optimizer (PSO) and genetic algorithm have been able to generate practical and reliable synthetic shear sonic logs. However, previous studies have primarily focused on comparing the overall performances of different machine learning models, leading to limitations in maximizing the performance of the best model. In this study, a hybrid machine learning model is introduced to enhance model performances, aiming to improve on the general approach. Additionally, data clustering and the combination of PSO algorithm with three representative machine learning models (SVR, DNN, and LSTM) are explored as potential approaches to further improve model performance and reduce manual intervention and time spent.

A multi-linear regression (MLR) model is employed to compare prediction accuracies for different numbers of features; the five-feature case demonstrated the best accuracies for both mean absolute error (MAE) and determination coefficient (R2). The study also provides details on the use of the PSO algorithm, describing it as an iterative computation employed to find an optimal solution by exploring a range of variables. The PSO algorithm operates by creating a population of particles (or swarm) within the search space, with the goal of seeking the best solution while moving positions. Additionally, the study details the use of callback and early stopping functions during execution to minimize unnecessary computation time.

The main focus of the study is on the introduction of a hybrid machine learning model for enhancing the accuracy of predicting dts log values. This approach involves the combination of an unsupervised classification algorithm using k-means clustering with three types of machine learning models (SVR, DNN, and LSTM), with optimal hyperparameters determined by the PSO algorithm. The findings of the study indicate that the LSTM-PSO and DNN-PSO models outperformed the SVR-PSO models, with the LSTM-PSO models demonstrating superior performance in terms of R2, MAE, and residual distributions, although they also exhibited more outliers leading to higher mean squared error (MSE) and root mean squared error (RMSE) compared to the DNN-PSO models.
