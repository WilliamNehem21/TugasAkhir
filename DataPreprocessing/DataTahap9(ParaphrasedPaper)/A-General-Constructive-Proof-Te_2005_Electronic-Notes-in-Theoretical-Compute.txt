The paper demonstrates that Theorem 3.3 represents the optimal constructively attainable result without introducing a principle that, though valid in standard models (intuitionistic, recursive, classical) of constructive mathematics, seems to be unprovable using solely intuitionistic logic and dependent choice. However, under specific additional assumptions, Theorem 3.3 can be enhanced to establish the uniform continuity of the strongly continuous function f.

Using classical logic, the uniform continuity theorem for continuous mappings from compact metric spaces to metric spaces can be straightforwardly derived from Theorem 3.3. Similarly, an established classical result regarding uniform convergence can be derived from our subsequent use of Proposition 2.3, which necessitates further definitions.
