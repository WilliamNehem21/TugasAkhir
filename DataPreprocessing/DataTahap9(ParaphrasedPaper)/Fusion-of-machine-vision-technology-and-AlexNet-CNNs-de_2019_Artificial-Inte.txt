According to data from the Food and Agriculture Organization in 2013, apple production ranks second globally (Czernyszewicz, 2016). While pesticides can increase apple yields, they also pose a risk to food safety due to pesticide residues. Detecting and restricting pesticide residues in apples is crucial for ensuring their safety. This study proposes a method for detecting pesticide residues in apples using hyperspectral technology, machine vision technology, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

Data samples for four pesticide residues (chlorpyrifos, two mixed pesticides, carbendazim, and an inactive control) were collected, each with three different samples containing 256 bands of spectral data. To increase sample diversity, Gaussian white noise was added to the hyperspectral images, resulting in a total of 4608 spectral data images for each pesticide residue category. The data set was divided into training and test sets using a bootstrap sampling method, and the CNN model AlexNet was employed for feature extraction and classification.

The study utilized a framework with five convolutional layers, three fully connected layers, and a three-layer max-pooling layer. The softmax function was used for classification, resulting in four perceptrons corresponding to the four types of apple pesticide residues. The CNN approach was compared with traditional image classification methods, such as support vector machines (SVM) and k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and was found to have lower time costs and higher robustness.

However, the study also identified limitations of CNN, particularly in cases where hyperspectral images of apples in the same band have a similar appearance. To address this, future research may focus on increasing the number of specific feature parameters of the convolution kernel to improve the network's ability to extract features from similar hyperspectral images. The authors declared no conflicts of interest.

Overall, the study highlights the potential of CNN-based approaches for detecting pesticide residues in apples using hyperspectral imaging, while also identifying areas for further improvement and research.
