In section 4, the authors extend the topological-sheaf semantics by generalizing it to work not only over topological spaces but also over more general neighborhood structures. This extended semantics encompasses neighborhood semantics with constant domains as a subclass, and it also encompasses kripke-sheaf semantics, as kripke sheaves are essentially neighborhood sheaves with relational accessibility. Thus, on the sheaf level, neighborhood-sheaf semantics encompasses and unifies not only topological-sheaf semantics but also kripke-sheaf semantics, analogous to how neighborhood semantics encompasses and unifies topological and kripke semantics on the propositional level.

In subsection 2.1, the authors highlighted the common features of kripke, topological, and neighborhood semantics for propositional modal logic. They then proceed to do the same for first-order logic. To interpret first-order modal logic, the authors extend the possible-world semantics by considering the category sets/x of sets over a given set x, in contrast to the set x used for interpreting propositional modal logic.

Furthermore, topological semantics for propositional modal logic involving a topology and interior operation on a set x of worlds is extended to topological-sheaf semantics for first-order modal logic by adding topologies and interior operations to the semantic structures reviewed in subsection 3.1, which are sets over x. Specifically, the extension involves considering objects, products, and arrows in lh/x, the category of sheaves over a topological space x, rather than in sets/|x|.
