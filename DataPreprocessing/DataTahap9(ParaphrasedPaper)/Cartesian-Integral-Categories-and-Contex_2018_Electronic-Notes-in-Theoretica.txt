This academic paper introduces and provides reasoning for the concept of a cartesian integral category. The paper aims to show that the cokleisli category of a (tensor) integral category should conceptually be a cartesian integral category, although currently, the existing integral categories do not possess enough structure for this to hold true in general. The primary goal of the paper is to establish a suitable integral structure on a coalgebra modality that actually results in its cokleisli category being a cartesian integral category. The main theorem of the paper asserts that any contextual integral category with a pseudo-linearizing transformation will have its cokleisli category as a cartesian integral category. This result is applicable to various scenarios, including those where the linear maps stem from a differential.

In the context of left additive categories, which are defined as categories where each hom-set forms a commutative monoid with addition and zero, and where left composition preserves the additive structure, a map is considered additive if composition on the right by that map also preserves the additive structure.

Furthermore, it is pointed out that every cartesian differential category features a system of linear maps, which are linear in the sense of the cartesian differential category. This system of linear maps includes the examples provided earlier in the paper.

The paper also delves into obtaining cartesian integral categories as cokleisli categories of contextual integral categories. It discusses simple slices of cokleisli categories and presents a system of linear maps for the cokleisli categories of coalgebra modalities.
