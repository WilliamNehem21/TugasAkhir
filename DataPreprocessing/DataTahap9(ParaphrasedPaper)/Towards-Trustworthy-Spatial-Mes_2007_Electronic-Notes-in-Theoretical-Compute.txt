The term "spatial messaging" refers to the dissemination of data in physical locations. Typically, individuals in the vicinity of a specific publication point receive the message. Although frameworks enabling users to freely publish spatial messages already exist, experiences with volunteers have indicated limited interest in posting such notes. The primary reason for this, in our view, is the absence of trust and security mechanisms that would establish the reliability of the messages, thus impeding their serious application. Addressing this gap will promote the success of spatial messaging, with the expanding popularity of location and mobile technologies providing substantial support for this concept. This paper outlines the spatial messaging services that we are in the process of deploying with our new spatial messaging framework, which includes trust and security mechanisms.

There are numerous reasons to anticipate that spatial messaging will become a widespread concept in the near future. Presently, people mainly utilize the connectivity of their mobile phones for one-way information downloads. However, as with the transition from television to the internet, the next generation of users will likely become more active and publish information. Considering the rapid advancement of computer power and the communication capabilities of these devices, coupled with the fact that there are now more modern mobile phones (with internet connection) than desktop computers in the world, the future of mobile technology appears promising. This assertion is supported by the growing interest in location awareness, as evidenced by the success of services like mobile mappy, which allows users to download maps and points of interest based on their current position.

Moreover, systems like ActiveCampus Explorer go a step further by displaying the locations of other users, enabling the tagging of objects. In the scenarios presented, the author determines who can access the posted message. While the debate over allowing publications for a restricted audience persists, the fundamental issue is how to handle this issue and what tools a spatial messaging system should provide. Trust is a complex concept, and establishing trust relations between machines or between humans and machines can entail varying definitions.

Any user can anonymously access all the virtual tags (vtags) in their vicinity by querying the server. To become a member, enabling the review and creation of vtags, a user must register and receive a unique pseudonym and key pair that ensures anonymity when reconnecting to the server. The registration process guarantees the uniqueness of pseudonyms and prevents the server from linking a pseudonym to a real-life identity. Additionally, the process safeguards against sybil attacks by requiring users to possess a digital certificate, which is blind signed to ensure uniqueness.

Furthermore, a standard way to represent vtags, based on XML, is proposed for interoperability. This would allow a single application to display all vtags, making the system more accessible and user-friendly. The paper concludes by emphasizing the importance of incorporating trust and security into spatial messaging, and discusses the deployment and validation of the trust model in real-life settings.

In summary, spatial messaging has the potential to become a widely accepted concept in the future, especially with the integration of trust and security mechanisms, as outlined in the geovtag framework. The paper also discusses the implementation and ongoing validation of the trust model in real-life settings to ensure its successful deployment on a large scale.
